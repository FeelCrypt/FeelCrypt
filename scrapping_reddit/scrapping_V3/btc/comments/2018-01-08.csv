"Too perfect. The dumb replies. The ""But LN tho""... Gosh... So accurate. Tabs and LN are not going to fix the issue."
"This whole situation just makes me sad. Sad that crypto currency won't end up facing the fight of its life from governments trying to shut it down but will slowly ebb away and die from self inflicted wounds.

I was a late adopter in late 2011 and to me, actually using bitcoin was more important than HODLing as a store of (potential value). I could buy and sell and transfer in seconds for practically no fee whatsoever.

I can't imagine how new adopters can wrap their heads around what is going on and although I don't have or hold any BCH just legacy, I'm starting to wonder whether the teams that work with legacy infrastructure have bitcoins best interest in mind.

It needs to be simplified and the power needs to be given back to the people,  not a bunch of miners and Dev's essentially holding progress hostage.

It really is sad. Like actual tears sad. It's hard to know what to believe when the well meaning and knowledgeable folks are mixed in with scammers, fear mongers and shills (on all sides)"

Love it.  This is exactly what it's like trying to teach them.
So true, so sad.
At this point - who cares.... I think they got the bitcoin that they wanted... great for them.  We should be reinforcing their active decision to remain at 1 megabyte.  This was a hard four years in the making.
