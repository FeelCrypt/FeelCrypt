"Welcome /r/all!

Edit: **9000** upvotes! META.

Edit **40,000** upvotes.... MEME MAGIC IS REAL. 

The crypto currency known as Bitcoin has hit an all time high of $9000! 

Alternatively: 1 mBTC (MilliBitcoin) is over $9.

"You think this is it? Wait till that Big Bang Theory episode hits. 

Just. Fucking. Wait.


There's a reason you won't see major networks cover it on their business sister channels. They're backed by companies that have interests against crypto. I'm actually flabbergasted they'd mention it on the show. It's like the cancer cure equivalent to money."
KAKAROT
Vegeta, I can't get a read on his power level...
Over 9000
Got the price alert and am stoked!
Haha yes
Well, I'm happy. 
Remember 8k anyone? Fucking forever ago.
Damn, it is almost 9,100 already.
Holly shit here we come 10K
"To any newbies thinking about getting in.

1. Don't panic buy. There are more gains in the future and it will take time.
2. Get an account on coinbase or look into localbitcoins. Coinbase is like the simplest and user friendlyist method possible.
3. Buy a small amount. like $20 or something and then WAIT. The worst thing you can do is buy a lot of bitcoin all at once.
4. In the meantime familiarize yourself with bitcoin using bitcoin**.org**
5. Be especially wary of scammers! ""Bitcoin Cash"", ""Bitcoin Gold"", Bitconnect, etc are **not** bitcoin. They are literal scams.
6. The links in the sidebar are good.
7. Learn about Dollar Cost Averaging / Automatic Investing and do that after you are comfortable with your $20.
8. Realize that you, yes you, value losses far greater than gains. If you have $100 to your name and you gain $50 you value this less than losing $50. If you are not aware of this, and you only buy bitcoin because of a fear of missing out then you will inevitably sell at a loss ensuring you lose money. Better to instead get your cash and lite it on fire. At least you get to look at a pretty flame."
Toasting in epic bread.
$10,000 by Monday morning at this rate !!
How do I convert the funds in my RothIRA and 401k to Bitcoin? Wanna retire early 
It's going to hit 75k by the end of September 2018.
Is it worth it to buy one at this point? 
9100 on GDAX. WTF.
I'd like to be a part of this history too. Hi. Hodling since 6k!
Every time you fuckers get to the front page I kick myself for being too poor to have invested on the last milestone
Am I too late for the hype?
Part of history.
This feeling never gets old.
It’s on a god damn rampage 
Where, I still see 8930 on coinmarketcap
Get the 10000 gifs ready peeps

Why Bitcoin is important / valuable: For the first time in human history, you can be your own bank. It is a censorship resistant, decentralized, global, system of trust. That has tremendous value any will change the world in so many ways we can’t even imagine. If you factor in the potential (similar to the discounted cash flow of a stock), it’s price is way undervalued in my opinion. "

Bitcoin. Fucking  the banks since 2009.

...should I buy more?"

Can't wait to see the price when Amazon start accepting Bitcoin next year :)
It was at 3,700$ a piece when I started this semester 
IT'S UNDER 9000!!!
Note to future self: This was a good day. Also stop reading though your old reddit posts and just enjoy all the money I made you. Your welcome.

Okay how can I buy bitcoin? I need to get some but I am completely clueless as to how or where to buy them. Can somebody give me a semi-detailed rundown? I’d really like to get into it.
START THE DAMN FOMO BEFORE I PISS MYSELF
I just can’t wait until 1 BTC can purchase a house in the Midwest 
NANI?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
I'm dumb about this stuff. What does this mean? ELI5? Is Bitcoin public and it costs $9,000 for one share? Sorry in advance for my stupidity, I do realize these are probably really dumb questions, and thanks in advance for any answers.
Is it too late to get in on this?
Congrats on reaching the top of /r/all !
"Can't believe we're finally at this day...I joked about it and secretly dreamed about this day for years and years...and it's finally here...

"There's still time to become an ""early adopter"".

Adoption of technology usually comes in 5 phases. 

These phases consist of the ""Innovators"" (2.5%), ""Early Adopters"" (13.5%), ""Early Majority"" (34%), ""Late Majority"" (34%), and ""Laggards"" (16%). 

You can help accelerate the adoption of this new technology as well as become an early adopter today! All you need to do is educate yourself and maybe even buy a little Bitcoin!"

"If you are new to Bitcoin and wondering why it's so valuable, please read this:

Bitcoin’s value derives from its current real uses (mainly for money transfers and remittances) its limited supply and scarcity (store of value) and its many potential uses. Also, behind the curtains there is a huge growth in the bitcoin ecosystem development that a regular folk can't see because it's ignored by the media.
> 
> If you buy for day trading you may lose money, but if you hold long term, it has been proven you get nice ROI. And bitcoin has barely started, think of the Internet/email in the 90's. A decentralized technology that has a valuable use it's not going to disappear, even if a few tyrannical governments try to ""ban"" it.

There is a limit of 21 million bitcoins (divisible into smaller units). ""Backed by Government"" money is not backed by anything and is infinitely printed at will by Central Banks.

"Posting in a legendary thread.

Bitcoin is going to change the world. Yes, the price is rising, but it isn't about that. It's decentralised banking - bank accounts and payments between them without a bank. Like Uber to taxi companies, or AirBnB to hotels. Mathematically verified, with no trust in any third-party, or any permission required. It is impossible for anyone to freeze your holdings if they don't have your private keys. It is banking for the billions of unbanked people in the world. Please read about the technology; it is so much more than just an asset to be traded and profited from.

"If you are new to Bitcoin, remember that:

1) You didn't miss the boat. Bitcoin is still in its early phases and it hasn't yet even come close to reaching mass adoption or institutional investment.

2) Bitcoin is highly divisible. The price is never ""too high"" to invest your first $50 into it - a 200% increase is still 200%, no matter how much of a Bitcoin you've bought, and it is predicted to keep going.

3) The best time to invest in Bitcoin was 7 years ago. The second best time is NOW.
There were people kicking themselves at $1000 that they missed the boat. These same people will be kicking themselves at $100,000."

Just as a note to anyone new to bitcoin/crypto who is reading this: you don’t have to buy a whole bitcoin. I thought that for the longest time and it kept me from investing. You can buy $5 worth of bitcoin if you want.
Maybe one day we'll look back and laugh at this post. Not because of the reference, but because of all the fanfare for such a small amount when BTC is valued at $100k.
