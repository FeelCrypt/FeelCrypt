I thought about you said some more later on. it does make a decent amount of sense. Force everyone to use this currency as a medium of exchange, and periodically print more of the currency, this incentives people to spend their money. And sort of mitigates the effects of someone hoarding a lot of money and never spending it. But yeah id love to see an experiment where we let a town use a currency and we dont print more of it and see how that plays out. idk.;1;0;False;BIG-DATA;dl92b0h;Just a quick reminder why Bitcoin was invented in the first place.

Its population grown plus productivity growth. And for BTC you can add in the percent of coins lost since they are never coming back either. The demand for money can actually grow faster than that too. With an increase in demand to use for exchange (i.e., more trade between people) you also need to add that increase as well, and now you can start hitting 10% deflation at times with some wild swings in value since BTC offers no way to adjust the supply to match the demand. There aren't going to be any loans denominated in BTC in that economy.;1;0;False;jnordwick;dl7u9lb;Just a quick reminder why Bitcoin was invented in the first place.

"> What we are really talking about is the velocity of the currency we are using.

This is of no importance, it is just neo-keynesian babble. It is never measured, only computed, it is really just another way to talk about gdp, which is also neo keynesian babble.

> without this constant tax the economy would expand very quickly and prices would change, mostly go down (or the coin goes up). 

yes. Products are paid with products. Money is just oil in the machinery. Value is not created when more money is printed. The wealth effect they (the central bankers) speak of is just a pathetic way of fooling the market participants.

A central bank starts by  lending nothing to the state, which then deposits that same nothing to the central bank. It is accounting fraud, refer to enron.

Then they rename the deposits to reserves, and starts lending to the people, and sells some of the bonds. They are the guys who pay for everything in the end. Wars, whatever. It has to end with a crash. Theory and historical evidence.

Sound money like bitcoin puts an end to all that. Back to the times where you do all right as long as you produce something and make sure you don't spend more than you earn. We are going to starve the banksters, they are only dirt on our shoes.

"not sure what you mean,  there is no way to prove money has value based on demand.  It's not possible.  The value or ""demand"" is what the buyer or holder of the money thinks they can trade it for,  another good or service.  The value is not the money. 

and let me edit this to bring it back to bitcoin for a second.   The network that is our trade has the value of not just the goods and services but also the synergy created by the trade, and the lack of tax means that synergy can grow very quickly,  compounding and growing the diversity of goods available within our network.  

Economy can be viewed as a community, and the bitcoin community will do well so long as users decide to commit and put skin in the game and trade on ""our"" network.  Each time a new product is offered and a new trade is made we all are rewareded because we each own ""shares"" of the network in the money we hold.

"This can be seen in the equation for the value of any economy in the calculation using ""velocity"".   What we are really talking about is the velocity of the currency we are using.  We choose a coin that can maintain and gain velocity and therefore defend the value we are holding ""on chain"".  

The more velocity the better, and most economies who experience huge synergy like the US economy for example have to be taxed at rates approaching 50% to achieve price stability.  

without this constant tax the economy would expand very quickly and prices would change,  mostly go down (or the coin goes up). 

You can only see this if you take away the dollar and only look at the coin and the goods and services.  As velocity and synergy is added to the network the value of the network expands, and participants in said economy reap a benefit in more buying power.  The goods they produce bring less income, but the income they get buys more goods and services.  

Kings and queens of old (or maybe preists) noticed this and would adjust the taxes to only carve off the synergy and keep prices the same.  They knew they were taxing too much if prices went up and too little if prices went down.  

The perfect scenario is to achieve an economy large enough that the synergy produced can pay for all the needs of the people.  I hate taxes, but on rare occasion the government paves a road or locks up a criminal that benefits me.   I would be happy to be honest and up front about the economy and the synergy and I would gladly pay in taxes the synergy portion of the increase in value that occurs when I trade,  but only to a government that spends this money in a good way.   

They are less than honest about how money works so I hate them for that and I want to see them starve, but maybe they are just ignorant.  

If we all understood how the system worked I'm sure a certain level of taxes would be sustainable, especially when we reap so much benefit that we are living like kings with robots doing all the work. 

It's a tough thing to understand and I don't fully understand all of it, but I can think through a process and predict an outcome pretty well.  

This thought process leads me to believe that the life or death of bitcoin segwit is in the hands of the developers.  If they drop the ball one more time bitcoin dies.  If they fail to implement the 2x portion of segwit bitcoin dies.   If they don't give us what satoshi promised bitcoin dies.

yes, they are valuing the good in the future.  They are using the network to store the value of what they have produced to exchange later for what they need.

"It fixes the fractional reserve fiat payment system by competing with it honestly.  As long as the central banks keep printing money, the value of bitcoin will keep appreciating relative to fiat, and more people will decide to store their wealth in bitcoin instead of playing the stock market or real estate.

As soon as central banks stop printing money, the value of that particular fiat would stop declining.

Bitcoin is going to provide a soft landing for an unstable financial system headed off a cliff by providing an off ramp that more and more people will use as the corruption of the financial system becomes increasingly obvious.

The early buyers of bitcoin will reap greater rewards than later buyers, but then they took a lot of risk by buying early.  And they are still taking on risk because it is not clear that bitcoin will be the most successful crypto currency in the log run.  I think its only fair the the people who risked the most would reap greater rewards, wouldn't you agree?

I also dispute that bitcoin, even if wildly successful in relieving central banks of their ability to print money, will force the economy into a deflationary spiral.

For one thing, having a secure distributed ledger for tracking asset ownership opens up the possibilities for using lots of other liquid assets as money, because they could be traded with low fees peer to peer.  Fractional shares of stock, for example, in companies with a stable price, or fractional shares of a basket of commodities chosen to achieve price stability.

Those other ETLAs (Electronically Tradable Liquid Assets) would all compete with bitcoin for use as a currency.  As the economy expands, the total volume of ETLAs (especially the commodity based ones) expands with it so you have a natural expansion of the money supply driven by market forces instead of a group of experts setting interest rate and inflation targets.

If those experts could set interest rates better than the market could, if they actually knew that much about how to optimize the economy, then why not have them set commodity prices while they are at it?

When you put policy pressure on an economic indicator it ceases to be an economic indicator.  It ceases to transmit useful information.  If you were to set a commodity price, it would cut the feedback loop between producers and suppliers that drives supplier investment into production.  If you were to set an interest rate, it would cut the feedback loop between savers and borrowers that measures the risk of business plans.";1;1;False;SilencingNarrative;dl8167b;Just a quick reminder why Bitcoin was invented in the first place.

I give that scenario an 80% probability.  I think there is a 10% chance that bitcoin will become worthless at some point in the next few years and some other crypto will take its place.

So I don't invest any more than I can afford to lose in bitcoin.  I buy $50 bitcoin, $50 litecoin, and $50 ethereum at the beginning of every month.

If I were hoarding, I would be buying as much bitcoin as I could get my hands on which is a lot more.

Here's what I think is going to happen.  Bitcoin will continue to grow in market cap in the next few years until it starts competing with the major fiat currencies.  At that point, every month that the major fiats continue the policy of quantative easing, bitcoin will continue to gain price w.r.t them.  Once a major fiat stops qe, it's price will stabilise w.r.t bitcoin.  

The governments of the biggest economies are not going to like being relieved of their ability to tax everyone through inflation and federal budgetary debt expansion, but they will have to as bitcoin will force their hands.

As the price of bitcoin stops it's upward trend, which will happen, the volume of trade will increase and there will be less holding.

"> The value of bitcoin can never be more than the value of the goods and services (the value and wealth) it is being used to transfer. 

Not. The value is only decided by people wanting to hold more (demand), and people wanting to hold less (supply). It is totally unrelated to the volume of trade, and totally unrelated to the value of useful real stuff.

The value coins can be less, and can also go far higher then the value of all fiat.

"I didn't say computers are currency. I showed that spending doesn't stop when prices deflate. There's no reason to assume that computers (and many other goods and services) are exceptions in this regard.

EDIT: Let me make it more  clear. Labour intensive services (like health care, education, restaurants) tend to increase in price more, while goods and services that aren't (computers, appliances, air travel) tend to fall in price. If falling prices would make people postpone buying, we should be able to observe that -- we don't.

The myth of ""deflation suffocates economic growth"" seems to come from the fact that with inflationary currencies, deflation only happens during economic depressions. So the deflation is a result of a depression, not the cause.

"Your deposits go down. Your account is debited. The bank now needs to transfer money to the receiving bank so the banks account is debited and the receiving bank is credited. So your bank better have the cash on hand. It will also need to meet reserve requirements too since it now has less cash on hand.

The only way new money is created is when the Fed steps in and floats an intraday loan (until the end of day when it will be covered by your bank either by borrowing from another bank that has extra reserves or from the Fed discount window). This isn't a result of fractional banking but of the Fed being the lender of last resort.

You can still have fractional banking without the Fed (it almost has to exist practically) and you can have the Fed and still have a 100% reserve requirement on demand deposits (there is still a place for deposit insurance and short term interbank lending). All the bank does is manipulate credit and move claims on future dollars around.

"Your not hearing what I am trying to say. 

Lets say there are 5 possible currencies to choose from, 

Lets also say there is nothing on the whole planet except one orange. 

The only thing of value is the orange. 

There is no way any of the currencies can be worth more than one orange. 

In fact all of the 5 possible currencies are worth nothing until the owner of the orange decides what currency to use to transfer the value.  

The value is not in the coin,  the value is in the good or service being transferred.  The coin is serving a purpose and or that a small fee may be paid to the coin itself, (or the miner) but the value is never is holding the coin. 

Bitcoin can be ""rare"" but if another invention comes along that is better and no one wants to transfer value on the bitcoin blockchain there is no amount of ""rare"" that will make it have a value. 

Your definition of ""demand"" is not defined well enough.  The demand for a coin is in the fact that it can ""do"" something. 

In this case lets say I grow corn and want to sell my corn for bitcoin and use my bitcoin in the winter when there is no corn for me to sell to buy goods or services.  I choose the ""currency"" that will hold value the best.  The value of the coin now holds the value of my sold corn while I wait to need that stored wealth to buy food later.  

One of the features of a good money is that it will act like this to store value.  

The money, the bitcoin has no value until we the user assigns a value to it.  

Once a person has skin in the game, ie I have sold my corn for bitcoin and hold bitcoin I will want to make sure others use my same coin,  automatically seeking a network effect and an increase in what I can buy and how much  I can get for my sold corn.  

Lets say in the winter I use my stored wealth to buy a jacket.  The bitcoin we used to trade corn for a jacket has no value, the value is in the fact that I have corn and you have a jacket and we agree to use bitcoin to transfer and store the wealth.  we are agreeing that I can store the value of my corn while I wait to buy a jacket.  This benefits both parties giving the maker of the jacket a new customer. 

No currency has value, not even gold.   

Gold is just a primitive ""proof of steak"" ledger.  

Gold acted as a ledger by saying ""who has the gold has the wealth"". 

Bitcoin works the same way, without a heavy metal object to carry around.  

Bitcoin is just a ledger,  and it can never be worth more than the goods and services being traded.  The hard part to understand is the gain we all get by actually trading. 

There are gains to be had by trading, we get the ability to specialize.  

the network also reaps the value of the ""value added when traded"". 

Lets say I grow 5 dollars worth of grain, and you have a chicken worth 5 dollars.   The government wants us to think that if we trade 5 dollars worth of grain for a 5 dollar chicken that the trade was even and no gain was made.  The reality is this,  My grain because I have so much of it was worth less to me than it was the owner of the chicken.  To me the grain was only worth 4.50.  The same goes for the chicken owner,  the chicken owner only values the chicken at 4.50.   Because I need chicken I see the value of the chicken at 5.50 and the value of the grain at 4.50.  The owner of the chicken sees the value of the chicken at 4.50 but the value of the grain at 5.50.    

When a trade happens you get the perceived value in total added to the network.  

The trade happens at 5.00 dollars, but I have traded a chicken that had a perceived value of 5.50, for some grain that also had a perceived value of 5.50.   

The government would say ""that trade happened at 5 dollars"" and there was no gain.  They do this to fool us into not knowing how fast an untaxed economy can snowball.  The government taxes the profit of the gain of the perceived value out of the trade.  

Really there was 11 dollars worth of goods traded, but the government would tax this trade and take 1 dollar,  keeping price stability for the value of the grain and the chicken and also getting rich.  

We are kept ignorant to the increase of value of the network or currency because taxes are always taking away the profit, the synergy.  

The money holds no value, only the goods and services do, and when a trade is made somewhere between 10% and 50% are gained by the network as added value.  

Trade is good, for everyone.  The trade is the value, not the money used to facilitate the trade.

"Yes that is false. The difficulty to mine stays the same all the time IF there is always the same hashrate (same amount of miners). If more miners join in, the hashrate increases and it will be more difficult to mine. The more miner join the network, the more secure the chain gets.    
The reason why it takes this long to mine the last coin is because the mining reward is cut in half every 4 years. So every 4 years, a miner earns less mining a block and that's why it's important to have transaction fees: to make up for this loss.

It's more like this has been discussed to death and yet people like that keep appearing with that argument. There is no evidence that Asicboost has ever been used but even if it had been used it would be a completely viable thing to do in a competitive market. It literally makes their products more energy efficient and it makes sense for a company to improve the things they sell to their customers. If it is evil to improve the efficiency of your own product, then making new, better ASICs would be as evil, yet companies do that all the time.;1;0;False;Raineko;dl8j49e;BTC just broke $3000!!!;6rpifz;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6rpifz/btc_just_broke_3000/
