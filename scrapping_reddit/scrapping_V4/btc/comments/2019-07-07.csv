At least you're smart enough to present the best piece of evidence against him, respect for that. I admit I do not know why he said what he said in that case. The amount of evidence that speak to his knowledge about bitcoin and what is possible beyond it, in addition to personally hearing him discuss such things in person have been more than overwhelming evidence for me. I urge you to read his medium posts if you have an open mind, if not no worries I'm not here to convince you. I wish you all the best;0;2;False;DerKuchenMeister;et5cf2w;The perfect crypto t-shirt;c9vx9u;https://i.redd.it/fjhqhhkktp831.jpg
You nitwits always jump to conclusions and never let the man explain himself. You linked to some shit where I can’t even view his original comment. You realize he stated he’s satoshi in the Kleiman case and there was NO OBJECTIONS?

I wasn't suggesting you hide your identity (or not).  I was suggesting that Satoshi clearly took some effort to do so, so pretending to be a different gender isn't very far fetched.";9;1;False;fireduck;et4qhax;The perfect crypto t-shirt;c9vx9u;https://i.redd.it/fjhqhhkktp831.jpg

"I have skimmed some of his medium posts, but they may not be a representative sample.

In the past I have used ""[Why I troll](https://medium.com/@craig_10243/why-i-troll-5304f2cbbfc3)"" as further evidence that he is not Satoshi.

In that piece, he doubles down on the false notion that Bitcoin mining makes progress. That is the only way the finding of blocks would not be independent events. Bitcoin mining is progress free *by design*.
