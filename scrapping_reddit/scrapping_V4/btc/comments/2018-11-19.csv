"If I were Craig (and Satoshi), I would try to tease people about it but definitely not give real proof until the moment to take BTC down comes.

&#x200B;

I am not sure if people are aware, but once the BCH chain is controlled (which will, regardless of the ABC short sided arguments, sorry), BTC is the next target. There can only be one real bitcoin protocol and I know which one it is. By controlled I mean organic growth, not the centralised crazy fuckin checkpointing that ABC did, that is just dishonest and not the Bitcoin protocol that gave me spine happiness chills when I found it for the first time.

&#x200B;

Yes yes, you can laugh now about what seems to be an incredible difficult event, but if SV actually deliver a bitcoin at scale with thousands or millions of daily transactions, I have a really hard time trying to think about someone that still prefers to stay on the ""store of value"" chain, which is slowly proving everyone (that wants to see) that BTC does not serve the ""store of value"" purpose.

I don't know the details. I'm just talking about the general marketing and vision I've seen described by supporters of each chain. SV seems much more focused on P2P cash, with fewer side distractions.;-9;4;False;vakeraj;ea08nb4;Truth in one tweet. üòÇ;9y9s2m;https://i.redd.it/66gh759zl5z11.jpg
"That may be the marketing message you are getting, but I honestly believe that the only way to be sure that your position is related to the actual situation is to understand the practical details and make a judgement from there. My view is entirely different to yours. I know SV *claim* that moral standpoint, but I see no technical evidence of it. In fact, it appears quite the reverse to me - i.e. the ABC guys are making valid tech calls on the situation.
