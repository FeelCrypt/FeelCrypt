" I've lost a lot of respect for all involved in pulling out of Segwit2x. 

Why, with around 80% of miner support didn't they go ahead with this?  

They've just let core / small blockers 'win' without a challenge. 

Perhaps they plan to switch from Segwit2x to Bitcoin Cash to get a more significant blocksize increase plus getting rid of Segwit, but there's no indication of this so far, and even if they did this they have still failed to keep their word in a very significant way.

Spineless, unbelievable behavior by those who said they were committed to 2x who have seemingly surrendered Bitcoin to Core / blockstream from a winning position.

"> You are looking at scaling solution, saying it doesnt work WHEN COMPANIES ARE NOT USING IT.

Then it is a failure. It is not a scaling solution. A solution would mean it was solved. It hasn't been. Even with 100% Segwit adoption, there will still be full blocks in no time. The real solution is to increase the Blocksize when blocks are full. Simple is safe. There's a reason for the K.I.S.S. acronym, ""Keep It Simple Stupid.""

> Bitcoin has NOT upgraded to segwit until companies SWITCH TO SEGWIT addresses. Is this CLEAR YET? Are you incapable of understanding something so simple? How can you POSSIBLY say segwit doesn't work well when THEY AREN'T USING IT?

I never said it didn't work. I did allude to it being a failure. Whether it's a failure of adoption or a failure to scale, it's still a failure. Many of the major proponents said it would provide immediate or nearly immediate relief from high fees. It hasn't. It's a failure.

>No shit the fee is rising, THEY ARE NOT USING SEGWIT. Is it really impossible to understand that you will not get 10cent fees if you are NOT USING THE NEW ADDRESSES? How deluded can you get?

If everyone was using Segwit, there would be no discount for Segwit transactions. Simple economics, no?

"Gold gained its reserve status after millennia of use as a currency.. alongside things like silver, copper, etc. Either way, your diatribe misses the fundamentals of bitcoin by miles, ignoring everything about the initial value proposition that propelled its growth. 

The skyrocketing value of bitcoin was meant to happen naturally as ""node level"" horizontal meshing took place --- which in the real world is called *small, local economies.* This meant people getting introduced to bitcoin through common purchases, especially appealing to food and other daily tx. 

This meant eventually, millions of *real people - economic actors* would be *naturally* invested in the network. As the network effect took hold and btc rose, hundreds of poorer communities around the world would ride an upward tide, a true global renaissance.

Instead, the system has been perverted by greed and lust for power.  The idea of turning bitcoin into a ""store of value"" is so completely tangent to what it was designed for and what ""to the moon"" really meant. It meant ""to the moon, *together.*"" ... instead we have some insane speculator driven greed where ""institutional money"" has come into the space looking for ""settlement and store of wealth."" 

Lmfao dude! Banks have bonds and ACH and shit. Their use case for bitcoin is zero. See hyperledger and xrp. They'll just privatize internal chains for the ""real money"" after they have secured comfortable positions in the ""public"" cryptos.

No, it's all about the economics.

"The slavery abolition movement began in May with a simple purpose: to end slavery and improve the lives of former slaves. At the time, the American community was in crisis after nearly a century of heavy debate and consensus for slavery seemed like a distant mirage with only 50% support among white land owning males.

Our goal has always been a smooth increase of freedom. Although we strongly believe in the need for abolishing slavery, there is something we believe is even more important: keeping America together. Unfortunately, it is clear that we have not built sufficient consensus for a clean slavery abolishment at this time. Continuing on the current path could divide the country and be a setback for America's expansion. This was never the goal of the abolition movement.

As slavery increases in the south, we believe it will become obvious that freedom increases are necessary. When that happens, we hope the country will come together and find a solution, with possibly an end to slavery. Until then, we are suspending our plans for a civil war.

We want to thank everyone that contributed constructively to the abolition movement, whether you were for or against. Your efforts are what makes America great. America remains the greatest country mankind has ever seen, and we remain dedicated to protecting it and fostering its expansion continent-wide.

"I agree with all of this, but you never spoke to why gold is preferred as a reserve currency over arcade tickets.  

> ignoring everything about the initial value proposition that propelled its growth.  

without the math, there is *no proposition to begin with* my friend. Without maximum decentralization, there is no proposition. Reserve currency is just one use case. Bitcoin right now fits the most important use case of all, which is store of value.

However,  I will praise your post, as I think otherwise you are accurate. The problem as I see it is that adoption has rapidly outgrown research and development of the actual block.  

I'm definitely not a small blocker only, that is a foolish idea unless we could realistically compress the data to fit and give low fees. Ultimately, compression and proper arrangement of the block through prudent development is preferred to expanding the block size or off chain solutions. In a perfect setting the block would be 1b in size, but that is probably impossible in every sense. Realistically, it is going to be a combination of diligent engineering and upping the block size as needed; hell maybe one day someone figures out a new and novel way to compress the data and we can lower the limit to 1kb or whatever. I *hope* we don't have to use off chain solutions at all, but depending upon their design and implementation they can work as well but I think we need to think long and hard before relying on them as a crutch.

Sorry if I came off as combative. I think bitcoin and bitcoin cash supporters should come together and demand the formation of some kind of entity that can do the diligent research necessary. Blockstream doesn't have the appropriate amount of trust among the user base, that much is obvious. It would be nice to get university research involved.

Exactly. Core's fee market can not work with 1MB blocks. In 1 MB blockspace you can only fit a few thousand transactions. If you want a secure chain, you need to put a lot of work (=money for mining) in it and get returns. With only 144 Blocks per day and (lets be generous) 3000 transactions/block, in the long run everyone has to pay 1/(144*3000) of the total mining cost per day for every transaction. This means that either the chain will not be very secure or transaction will be very expensive. To pay the current miner reward (and thereby keep the chain as secure as now) just with fees, every transaction would cost ~$30.;3;1;False;xFxD;dpjwfv5;segwit2x canceled;7bmp4u;https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-segwit2x/2017-November/000685.html
"If one developer proposes an idea and develops it, great. Nice work. That's how bitcoin started right? We assume it was Satoshi (one person).

BUT, now that it's a $120 BILLION dollar market, it should be tested by as many developers as possible. It should have the smartest minds in crypto trying to break the developed idea of that developer over a period of time. Then, if the majority of these developers deem it to be safe and robust code, it will be released to the community for their feedback, and the miners/users/companies will decide whether they want to adopt it.

That is what I would consider the correct process to proposing an improvement/upgrade/change to Bitcoin.

"**Is Jihan Wu a double agent?**

Of the 6 Bitcoin traitors (The Pullout Six):

Mike Belshe

Wences Casares

Jeff Garzik

Peter Smith

Erik Voorhees

Jihan Wu

Jihan Wu is the only one with significant hash rate, he was the linchpin that could tip the balance, yet this was his second time refusing to pull the trigger at the last minute to increase the block size.

A controlled opposition is someone who looks exactly like an activist, gathers all the opposing force then bail out at the last minute, like the Catatonia independence movement.

These 6 traitors just pulled a Catatonia, Mike Belshe and Jeff Garzik are obvious double agents, the question is, is Jihan Wu also a controlled opposition, or was he under duress, did he know all along or was he threatened or bribed somewhere along the way?

Why did Jihan Wu pull out of the Hong Kong Agreement, Bitcoin Unlimited, New York Agreement at the last minute?

He was the only person with real hash rate, if Jihan wanted small blocks he could have stayed quiet 3 times, if Jihan wanted big blocks he could have stayed the course 3 times.

Why is it always Jihan Wu that looked like an opposition then pull out at the last minute?

Why is Jihan Wu so quiet about being screwed again?

Why is there no noise on taking back Segwit support once the agreement failed?

"Its incredibly frustrating reading this sub and seeing so many people simply dismissing bitcoin and trying to say that BCH is now bitcoin, it isn't.

I like watching NBA basketball.  My favorite team is the Warriors.  OKC is mad because they can't seem to beat the Warriors.  It's as if OKC one day decides we want to be the NBA champs, so from now on we're going to say ""We're the Warriors now!   So from now on call us the Warriors, and one day soon we'll be the champs!""

Do you see how stupid that is?  It doesn't work like that.  I don't have a favorite team in crypto nescessarily, I just like to make money from crypto.  Bitcoin is/was the first, and led the way for ALL of these other cryptos.  That's where my fondness for it comes from.  It has proven to be successful, i.e. make money. 

 When I was buying BTC last year for $1600, I thought I was crazy, as did any of my friends I told about it.  Now the shits over 7k, wow.  I saw ETH moving in January.  I moved my modest little chunk of BTC into ETH and almost made 10x on my investment in a few months.  I left a job I hated, paid my bills for a good 6 months, bought a car for a step daughter, and took my girl friend on a fantastic all expense paid vacation.  It was awesome.

Now here I am again, with a modest little chunk of ETH, while BTC went up 2k while I was on vacation.  I'm about to move my ETH back into BTC in the next day or so, whenever this dust settles.

I read r/btc  (among others) to glean a little insight as to what these cryptos are doing. Namely,  bitcoin.  Now that this sub is anti bitcoin, and all in BCH it annoys me to no end.  Not because of BCH in general, but because this sub wants to call themselves bitcoin, it isn't.  There are many versions of bitcoin, none of them are bitcoin, and none are number one on coinmarket cap, bitcoin is.

There's money in these cryptos, and we can all make some.  OKC isn't the Warriors, and BCH isn't bitcoin.  Let's all move on and try to make some money together; this isn't basketball, and there doesn't have to be one champion.  BCH should worry about BCH, hell it practically doubled the last 2 weeks while I was away.  I would have loved to have been in on that.  I can read coinmarketcap daily and look at all of the 30% gainers in a single day.  I wished I had some of thay action too!

Anyways.... enough of the rant and good luck kids.  Spare me the we're going to change the world stuff.  While I appreciate the sentiment and agree to an extent. That's a LOOONNGG way off.

"It really doesn't, at least not to an problematic extent. Many people who come from Core's idea of what Bitcoin is seem to think that every network participator should have to run a full node on their system (validates transactions and keeps the blockchain on the system), however this was never part of the initial design. It's a bit like asking every mail user to run their own mail/SMTP servers to send mails.

If blocksize increases the blockchain gains weight more quickly. Full 8MB blocks would on average take up 1 GB of space per day, which accumulates over time. This is however no issue for Bitcoin businesses and miners, as they could easily pay the increased costs for nodes. There is simply no reason for the average Bitcoin user to require these storage capacities, as they can simply use SPV wallets.

There are some more centralization arguments about this topic, however they don't make much sense. There is Moore's law and research on the way to heavily improve Bitcoin node performance.

Having less privately run nodes (by end users) on the network does technically decrease ""decentralization"" if only Bitcoin businesses who need to run a full node do so, however the network was never meant to be ""100%"" decentralized. There is a point where the decentralization for the network is good enough to prevent shutdowns or takeovers. SPV wallets are perfectly fine, so even if you don't run a full node your funds are safe and you can transact with them without issues. If Bitcoin wants to replace fiat you cannot require every user of the network to run a node to use the network.

Of the 6 Bitcoin traitors (The Pullout Six):

Mike Belshe

Wences Casares

Jeff Garzik

Peter Smith

Erik Voorhees

Jihan Wu

Jihan Wu is the only one with significant hash rate, he was the linchpin that could tip the balance, yet this was his second time refusing to pull the trigger at the last minute to increase the block size.

A controlled opposition is someone who looks exactly like an activist, gathers all the opposing force then bail out at the last minute, like the Catatonia independence movement.

These 6 traitors just pulled a Catatonia, Mike Belshe and Jeff Garzik are obvious double agents, the question is, is Jihan Wu also a controlled opposition, or was he under duress, did he know all along or was he threatened or bribed somewhere along the way?

Why did Jihan Wu pull out of the Hong Kong Agreement, Bitcoin Unlimited, New York Agreement at the last minute?

He was the only person with real hash rate, if Jihan wanted small blocks he could have stayed quiet 3 times, if Jihan wanted big blocks he could have stayed the course 3 times.

Why is it always Jihan Wu that looked like an opposition then pull out at the last minute?

"BU was more like S2X in that it was, as I understand it, meant to replace btc and become btc. (Two chains competing for relevance under one coin.)

"Thanks for the link. Here's my transcript of the relevant section:

""And if you have an opinion on this as to which version of bitcoin is the better one let's say it does wind up that there's two chains I'll tell you, I will sell my coins on the slow expensive core chain and use the proceeds from that, if I'm even able to get my coins in a confirmation block to get it to an exchange, but that'll probably be really difficult because the network fees will be so high and there will be so little hashrate on that chain, but if that were even possible to do I would sell those coins, use the proceeds to buy more of the useful bitcoins because Bitcoin Unlimited coin is going to be so much more useful because you'll actually be able to send and receive them with people, unlike the Bitcoin Core coins on this congested network that'll take forever and cost a fortune to move the Bitcoins.""

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpOnolf1tS8&feature=youtu.be&t=23m9s

He doesn't say **all** his coins, though you **could argue** that that's what he's implying. Even still, he's also talking about Bitcoin Unlimited and the video was uploaded to youtube on 3/20/2017, so this is long before Bitcoin Cash, and the upgrade to Bitcoin Unlimited's block size was going to be very different from the way Bitcoin Cash forked Bitcoin. Given that, I think that this source is, at best, half relevant. It would be a good source to provide if Roger said ""I didn't sell all my btc"", and you wanted to ask Roger himself what exactly changed, if anything, since he made that video.

Lets look at the facts. 

He's not done anything to contribute to bitcoin that doesn't benefit him, all he talks about is economics. He's a good guy to get on a show, he appears confident, uses weasel words, and puts his point across well, just like any good politician, its all lies and deceit. 

Bought bitcoin.com, its a business, not a reference site. Pushes it heavily on this sub. 

Runs r/btc like its an extension of bitcoin.com, same styles, links to ""official bitcoin.com links"". Check his post history, few comments in his own threads, mostly just pumping his site or coin. 

Nearly all the links in the sidebar are linked to Ver. Either his own site, or companies he has invested in. 

Has an advert masquerading as a link in the sidebar (link to his pool, in not sure if this should really be allowed on Reddit?).

Refuses to list the core bitcoin client in his ""nodes"" list, despite the fact that something like 75% of the network runs it.  Instead links very niche (sub 1% of the network) clients. Which can conveniently run BCH. 

Constantly promotes his own site and domain, thus us actually against the reddit content guidelines for posting. This sub is nothing but SEO and backlinks to his site.

"Fair question, and one many grapple with. The reality is that so long as blocks stay small and thus the blockchain growth is small, then BTC will be a better store of value than BCH. Over time once BCH gets multi-terabyte blockchain and is several orders of magnitude bigger than the BTC blockchain, people will be nervous about the long-term viability of BCH and be drawn to store funds in BTC as a safer option.

Also for BCH to really take off as ""cash"" then it needs to maintain a fairly stable value. Otherwise it'll be a victim of its own ""success"" and people will want to horde BCH and use another crypto for buying and selling. Read up on Gresham's Law for a more in-depth discussion of this.

And I contacted their support if anyone is curious, they said and I quote ""The discrepancy you're referring to is the 0.002 BTC miner fee used to send funds from ShapeShift to you.  This is not a ShapeShift fee, it is the fee required to process transactions on the blockchain.  The miner fee is required any time ShapeShift sends fees, whether it's the exchange withdrawal or the refund of a failed exchange.  You agreed to this fee when you accepted the ShapeShift Terms of Service.  Your exchange failed because the amount you sent was over the deposit limit.  The limits are on every Quick Exchange order page.  These limits are dynamic and change with the price changes every 30 seconds.  If you find it difficult to make deposits within the limit parameters, you're welcome to use a Precise Exchange and designate the deposit amount before you send your funds.""

"Are there any examples in history where it worked out this way? I think one Point in which modern society is an improvement to archaic ones is how it can handle conflicts and change without bloodshed. Institutional change is a fairly modern concept. Every ""revolution"" gives power to people which aren't capable of handling it, just as Bitcoin seems to centralizes ist power around the big players in the market which can use their money to run FUD campaigns, incentivize behind the scenes, so that the origin idea is slowly becoming nothing more than a semantic in this game of power. It's just my guess as a social scientist that this is the way BTC is heading right now and it's only possible because the trust in technology to solve all problems of inequallity alone and without institutional governance is a rather shortsighted idea. It has to be flanked by institutional frameworks to work properly. 

Btw.: I base my judgement not on single social philosophers and theoretical ideas. But I'd like to see - empirically - how this whole thing will play out.

"This was done because I run another service called AnonSteem. Moving the Bitcoins after receiving them costs me out the ass, it severely chews into the profit and thus I have to raise the price for Bitcoin users.

Thanks to this, I applied a $10 surcharge on Privex to any person crazy enough to pay with Bitcoin.

**Example:** The average transaction for AnonSteem is 0.004 BTC (now $30), which means sending 0.40 BTC ($3000) is around 100 inputs.

This can result in a transaction fee of an astonishing $50 to $100 (0.01 BTC, 2.5% of the tx) if I want it confirmed within a *FEW DAYS*.

**It can be $300-400 (0.04 BTC, 10% of the whole transaction) if I want it confirmed within a day**

This is a real example of me extracting profits from the AnonSteem Bitcoin addresses from a few months ago: https://i.imgur.com/ZSdpwp7.png - note this is after setting it to very low fees, and it would take about 4-5 days to confirm.

But again, clearly, it would mean people are doing things with bitcoin that they find worthy of spending $50 to do it.

You would still use high few low Speed BTC, because you make your own laws and you're free to do whatever you want? So THEN tx time wouldn't matter anymore, right?
