"That is a possible scenario yes. Here in the US it should be deductible from any other capital gains passive income you might have, I believe. I left it out as it doesn't pertain to capital gains, which was the poster's fear. 

Cool thing is that you can do tax loss harvesting though.

"More hash power is not better security.  More proportional distributed hash power does.  Asics cause less distributed power over the nodes, reducing security and making the possibility of 51% attacks much easier.  It's not an unreal possibility for an advanced tech country to manufacture a great deal of powerful asics and bring them online at once with more than 51% of the hash power.

All coins have this weakness.  Any small coin that's POW could be destroyed with a single mining farm being pointed in their direction.  POS is a bit harder, you have to assume that a single actor can get more than 51% of the coin, which could be harder if there's passionate believers in the coin.";2;2;False;PM_ME_YOUR_NANO;dv58n3w;Paid a beer using Bitcoin Cash in Paris, adoption is real!;81r2p3;https://i.redd.it/81tz8c33qkj01.jpg
