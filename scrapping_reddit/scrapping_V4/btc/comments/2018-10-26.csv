"I agree that all of the things you brought up are also pretty bad for newer startups, but in my opinion the number one barrier to entry for small companies is taxes.

Where I live for example, there are no small companies in things like grocery stores, banking, gas stations or any kind of non-physical fields anymore (even these are starting to die now). 

When I grew up we used to have a bunch of small companies all over and there was no lack of people coming to them, but after the world suddenly had to become progressive and start taxing people because of emissions and ""evil"" plastic, they all went bankrupt. This wasn't because chains were cheaper, chains were always the first to increase their prices, and often had worse deals with distributors. There was no lack of people, it all came down to the small business not being able to keep in business when their margins were being murdered from a ever increasing wave of taxes.

This is the route a lot of other countries are also going down thanks to German-controlled organizations like the EU, all because of unproven theories like human-made climate change.

"First of all I'm glad that you're not doubting that the planet is warming, because trying to explain climate change to someone who doubts every and all temperature probes on the planet is excruciating.

You're absolutely right that the earth has natural cycles. The [Milankovitch cycles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milankovitch_cycles) describe the effects of the change of the Earth eccentricity, obliquity, precession angle etc. On the climate and roughly correlate with empirical data for the temperatures in the past millions of years. The problem is that doesn't explain the EXTREMELY fast temperature changes that we have seen over the past 200 years (+1.4° most common estimation). This is the key factor that's missing here : how can this cycle that would usually change the earth temp by +/-2°over 100000 years act so fast. There's 4 orders of magnitude of difference between the 2 timescales.

I didn't follow your paragraph about the CO2 emissions coming after temperature increases but this time coming before? Where did they come from usually and why is it different this time? Anyway there's plenty of evidence that CO2 is a greenhouse gas, tons of YouTube videos and experiments you can do at home. Now, you can tell me that CO2 is not the main component warming the planet in the atmosphere and you'd be right. The main component is water. The difference is that the water concentration in the atmosphere regulates itself. The CO2 also regulates itself to a degree (dissolved in the ocean, absorbed by algae, trees, etc.) but the massive increase in CO2 caused by burning fossil fuels + deforestation broke this regulation and its causing a feedback loop (hotter => more water vapour from the oceans => water vapour is a greenhouse gas => even hotter). [Here is a short article on that](https://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/vapor_warming.html). So in short you are partly right that CO2 alone doesn't cause climate change, but even the tiny amount that we put out there is enough to deregulate the fragile temperature equilibrium of the Earth. 

You hinted that in a few thousand years we will teach an ice age. It's short of true, if the natural temperature cycles followed their previous periods, the earth should be slowly cooling down. So WHY does it I warm up, and why is it so fast? Changes of this scale at this speed were never seen before. [I like this timeline because it conveys very well this issue of timescale of warming events.](https://xkcd.com/1732/)

Hope I got the point across. If you can reformulate and source what you said about CO2 coming before or after increases in temperature I would be glad to try to understand your argument again.";0;1;False;mistrpopo;e8i10p3;Loll;9rekl0;https://i.redd.it/hhja1n4qheu11.jpg

"There is more proof to the contrary actually, than there is for human-made climate change, so this has nothing to do with religion or faith. There is not one ""first world"" country who has not used climate change as a way to increase taxes, the only people who benefit from climate change is the state. And even if, although highly unlikely, human-made climate change was a thing we could herd cows into small buildings and run the air leaving the building through a co2 filter, and we'd instantly bring co2 levels back to what is normal for this time during the natural warming-cooling cycle of the planet.

The state has cucked you so hard that you are willingly giving your freedoms away and trying to hide it. Again, the only people that benefit from climate change hoaxes are states, the people who don't benefit, individuals, companies and small business. Your grand-grand-grandchildren will look back on you as a traitor when they are living in their government-assigned igloos mid the next ice-age waiting for their next coal mine shift to start so they can get their daily ration of salad.";2;1;False;KosinusBCH;e8hefl9;Loll;9rekl0;https://i.redd.it/hhja1n4qheu11.jpg
"Sure, but based on past events like this we can also deduce that temperature on earth moves independently of CO2, as seen time and time again as temperature precedes CO2 emissions, and also ends before CO2 emissions have had time to decline again.

So if CO2 does have an effect on global temperature, it's not to a very noticeable degree. Of course it could be that the data these studies were based on use too small of a sample size, and it is in fact the biggest danger we face, at least until a couple hundred to a thousand years when we enter a new ice-age yet again, irregardless of CO2 emissions.

My problem with human-made climate change is that there just isn't enough solid evidence for it for me to willingly give away all of my freedoms, pay close to all of my money in taxes to the gov, just so they can do absolutely nothing about it while they push electric cars down my throat which, if successful, will have a much greater effect on the local enviorment down here on earth as inevitably batteries die after a few years from production and have to be dumped somewhere, and the cars, since they are long out of warranty by this point will have to be dumped and replaced.";1;0;False;KosinusBCH;e8hrt2j;Loll;9rekl0;https://i.redd.it/hhja1n4qheu11.jpg

There's also some governments in on the human-made climate change hoax increasing prices on anything that people buy so they can make more money off you without the public knowing about it.
