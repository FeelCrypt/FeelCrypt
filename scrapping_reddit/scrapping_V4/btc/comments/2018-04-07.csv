"Mark,  you don't have to explicitly or implicitly endorse MtGoxLegal. You could simply send out an email with a number of links to groups with ongoing and active efforts to affect the outcome of the case (mtgoxlegal.com, mtgox-creditors.com, cryptovinder.com/mtgox/, etc)  Creditors could make up their own mind. You could just remind creditors that this is an important time and if they want their voice to be heard they should hire a lawyer or connect up with a group that they agree with that already has a lawyer.

"This is a frustrating response. 

I'm not convinced that any other creditor group is as big, as well resourced or as active as Mt Gox Legal. I don't accept that sending an email is a one shot deal, but even if it were, your logic seems to be - Its better to help no one than someone.

I think you see that we are resourced and motivated and instead of choosing to support us you find a range of changing excuses to hide behind.

Instead you insert yourself in the centre of the process of a fair distribution giving false hope to creditors, who don't have the benefit of clear unbiased legal information, with the vague and unachievable promise of 100% recovery. Lets not forget you are on trial for embezzlement from Mt Gox and its creditors. There is strong evidence you cooked the books, not for the interests of creditors as you claim, but to cover your mismanagement and incompetence. You've lied to creditors before, rationalising it in your head, thinking that you alone could sort things for them, but things got catastrophically worse. Now it looks increasingly like you're still applying that same hubris in this situation.

You say in this AMA your biggest regret in running Gox was not to step back and let others manage the business as it grew. It's now bigger than ever Mark. Why not heed your own advice and step back from this process?

Your input to a solution here is important and your support is welcome, but it's not essential and it's not appropriate or necessary for you to be attempting to coordinate a CR plan until you're cleared of embezzlement charges, something which is not a foregone conclusion. Instead help the creditors develop their own plan. 

You know that your involvement is polarising and splits creditors support, and you accept that creditors have strength by uniting. Instead of helping unite us, you're guarding the resources you have. 

If it's me personally you aren't comfortable with, or fear of some secret agenda you're concerned about, I'll step down from managing Mt Gox Legal and let our elected Governance Board and members vote on a new administrator, in exchange for you sending out an email to invite creditors to join. 

Your response is frustrating, so you'll excuse my irritated tone, but at least it clarifies that your offer of support to over 900 creditors is a veneer. Please prove me wrong.

"**Cognitive dissonance**

In the field of psychology, cognitive dissonance is the mental discomfort (psychological stress) experienced by a person who simultaneously holds two or more contradictory beliefs, ideas, or values. The occurrence of cognitive dissonance is a consequence of a person performing an action that contradicts personal beliefs, ideals, and values; and also occurs when confronted with new information that contradicts said beliefs, ideals, and values.

In A Theory of Cognitive Dissonance (1957), Leon Festinger proposed that human beings strive for internal psychological consistency in order to mentally function in the real world. A person who experiences internal inconsistency tends to become psychologically uncomfortable, and is motivated to reduce the cognitive dissonance.

"> Pre-history is left for anthropologists.

Well, my original comment with which you disagreed did say ""all of the world has done for the vast majority of history""; I made no claims about pre-history :P Even then, I am not sure how 'free' pre-historic humanity was. This is a world where might makes right. Where it is impossible for the weak or the sick or old to have any possessions. Where only 40% of men could pass on their genes, etc. I guess it is a freedom in a certain sense of the word. Personally I would prefer a society where peaceful non-violent relations are the norm.

> Do you have any examples? I am curious.

Well for example 19th century United States, particularly in the 'Wild West', had virtually no government influence and yet had plenty of trade and market activity. Another example might be the Kowloon walled city in Hong Kong, that literally had no government and belonged to no country, and yet had thriving business and trade. 

Even today, a lot of activity in the seas and oceans, as well as on the internet, are more or less lawless (even in this post Mike Hearn calls the internet lawless) and yet a large amount of trade happens through both of these mediums. I am aware, however, that there have never really been perfectly free markets in history.";1;0;False;zveda;dwyht1l;AMA: Ask Mike Anything;89z483;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/89z483/ama_ask_mike_anything/

">When someone has a different opinion than I do, it doesn't mean I can't learn from them.

Actually, sometimes it does. It depends **entirely** on how fundamentally your opinions differ.

In this case Mike's opinions are in stark contrast to my own in a fundamental way - I think Bitcoin is the future of the global economy, he thinks it **already** failed. There's quite *obviously* no reconciliation. 

The guy who was determined to invent an aeroplane would be an idiot if he sat down to ""learn"" from someone who was going to explain all the reasons why it is not going to be possible when he had already worked out how it was to be done.

> Oligarchy (from Greek ὀλιγαρχία (oligarkhía); from ὀλίγος (olígos), meaning 'few', and ἄρχω (arkho), meaning 'to rule or to command')[1][2][3] is a form of power structure in which power rests with a small number of people. These people might be distinguished by nobility, wealth, family ties, education or corporate, religious or military control. Such states are often controlled by families who typically pass their influence from one generation to the next, but inheritance is not a necessary condition for the application of this term.
