"[this may help](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvpD3iF9DCA)

Bitcoin split back in August into two coins, a SegWit fork and a big-block fork, as the Bitcoin community had already been split for a long time. There are people on both sides believing their fork is the real Bitcoin and the other represents a hijacking of Bitcoin. The moderator of r\/bitcoin is aligned with Blockstream and had banned big-block supporters from that subreddit long before the eventual August split, which means big-block supporting views are overrepresented here in r\/btc, while the opposite view is the only one represented/permitted in r\/bitcoin.

Because the SegWit fork has the BTC ticker name (""BCH"" being the other fork), **""BTC"" is often used in r\/btc as a shorthand for the SegWit fork**, and the opinion that it's a small-block hijacking of Bitcoin is common in r\/btc. This fork doesn't work well at the moment because it hasn't scaled well (because small-blocks), but rather than acknowledge it has a problem, its proponents are pretending it's just because an exchange  - Coinbase - hasn't implemented all of the scaling that SegWit allows yet. The Malicious Advice Mallard ribs people calling for a Coinbase boycott / saying Coinbase is why their fork is in trouble, but if you interpret it as a ""bad advice duck"" then...";11;0;False;iwannabeacypherpunk;dsn813t;One advice for Coinbase;7q4kol;https://i.redd.it/xl6efkjgcu901.jpg

Don't pick a side, bch or btc. Buy at least 60% of the money you choose to invest in btc+bch in bitcoin core. Maybe 80-90% in btc if you believe in the core way of things.

If you can compare the cost of a simple batch transaction contract to a multiple-output Bitcoin batch transaction, that would be helpful as well (in figuring out which system is best for ""payments only"").

For complex contracts, it is apples to oranges. For instance, something like a decentralized exchange or a stable coin is currently not possible on Bitcoin, so adding the cost of such transactions to the comparison does not make much sense.

Not saying this to be in favor of Ethereum, but facts are facts. If your argument were about the fact that p2p transactions need to compete with other contracts in order to be included in a block, then I think it is an important point to consider when building a payment system.

Also, BCH has had a higher number than LTC for about a week now.

You are right that we have no way of verifying whether or not they log. But that's true for all VPN providers. There are no anonymous VPNs because that's not possible with how VPNs work.

TOO LATE MOTHERFUCKERS, I already switched from PIA to airVPN because airVPN immediately accepted bitcoin cash. now suffer the consequences you fuckers at PIA, you lost customers forever, airVPN is actually better anyway, like WAY BETTER. airVPN allows very easily port forwarding and your VPN connection stays up for weeks while PIA connections break once in every couple of days.;0;1;False;1Hyena;dsnu55d;Private Internet Access accepts Bitcoin Cash;7q8dz4;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7q8dz4/private_internet_access_accepts_bitcoin_cash/
"PIA is the biggest honey-pot VPN in existence. Look up the history of ""LavaBit"" (spelling?) and think long and hard.... if something that small caused such a harsh response, what do you think the reaction would be for these folks... seeing as this is infinitely a more significant deal. They NEVER come under US scrutiny. I can think of about 20 VPN providers that weren't located in the US, yet were effectively ""shut down"" by the US. Yet these guys operate out in the open in US jurisdiction, and nobody does shit? Get fucking real guys.

95% of all VPN services you find on the web are likely to be honey pots. They might help with keeping your porn viewing and downloads secret from your ISP, but meh. If you find your VPN on any sort of ""review/compare"" (LOL) website, then think twice before subscribing. 

""keeping logs"" mean nothing when the company controls the keys - and they can't prove anything.";-2;5;False;stephenfraizer;dsnhtzx;Private Internet Access accepts Bitcoin Cash;7q8dz4;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7q8dz4/private_internet_access_accepts_bitcoin_cash/
