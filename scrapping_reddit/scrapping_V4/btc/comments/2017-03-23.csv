Bitcoin Core is controlled by a hand full of developers - kicking Gavin and Jeff out, has further centralized what is already very centralized control. - I'm implying if they got more decentralized derision makers, it wouldn't be decentralized enough. 

>On a side note, while anyone can apply, all members are hand chosen by theZerg.

No it is not. founding members were the people who birthed the idea over a year long debate - That debate was open to everyone on bitcointalk.org - when we started criticizing the handling of Bitcoin-XT  - we had over 50,000 page views a day - tehymos shut it down so it moved to www.bitco.in/forum.

Memebrrs vote in new members. theZerg gave up all authority when the federation was launched. All governing rules were defined before any code was written. The first vote was to fork Bitcoin and implement what is now known as BUIP001 user adjustable block size, BU was launched before Classic. 

I believe we need many different forms of OSS governance. XT and the linus torvalds, benevolent dictator model, Cores centralized console of developers model, BU's democratic control of OSS, and others. each has merits and limitations. 

BU members want more diversity and decentralized control of the rules - they don't want to take power away from Core, they want to decentralize it.

"""Bitcoin needs multiple clients and independent developer groups.""

Absolutely. There should be an ecosystem of development groups in Bitcoin. It seems to me that, as a consensus generation machine, Bitcoin's strength requires there to be multiple competing ideas to be either accepted or rejected by the mechanisms of its design. If we have only one developer group working on it, then really what's the point of having a consensus mechanism at all? I hope that regardless of who ""wins"" the current impasse, multiple groups of developers keep floating new models and new ideas for the community to debate, accept, and reject.

So, because his analogy is imperfect based on the differences of open/closed source codes, are you arguing one centralized group of developers is better?  His argument still stands, opposing groups of developers working towards their own goals increases the chances of bugs being exposed.

"Large well known established open source software projects have had serious security problems too. Not just ""I can crash your server then post about my bravery on reddit "", but ""I can escalate privilege and pwn your shit"" stuff.

None of it is really newsworthy if we've been paying attention. We generally accept that shit happens, try to design our systems in layers to resist a single point of compromise, and hope we can race the bad guys to fix shit before they exploit it.

And maybe that bears repeating. Folks that malicious exploit a bug to disrupt other people's systems are the bad guys. Folks that make a point to notify those bad guys as early as possible in the interval of time from when a fix is published and when it widely distributed, are also the bad guys. (cue the cries of ""Oh but there was no possible way to know those tweets were going to be instrumental in the commission of multiple felonies."")

This would once have been non-controversial, but some folks somewhere have misplaced their moral compass.
