"> You were not, are not, and will not, ever be on the same playing field as the top 1%.

Physician heal thyself.  You have a victim's mentality.  The reason you can not compete with the ""1%"" is because of your attitude.   The 1% is very fluid and most are in it for a short time.  If you are talking about the World 1%, then most in the US are the world's 1%.  If you are talking about the history of human beings, most of everybody living today is in history's 1%.

>  Just keep buying so the price goes up? 

You see the world as being binary.  That wealth is static and those that wealth have it at the expense of others.  Why do you have to keep buying? 

> They can cause more selling than buying no matter how many coins you hold.

How can they force you to sell?  Do people not have a choice in the transactions?  Some coins are limited in number and can prevent inflation.  Inflation is what fiat currencies suffer from and this is one of the reasons for the creation of cryptocurrencies.  Inflation is what those in power want.  That has been one of the largest wealth transfers.

"I was going to agree with the “biggest transfer of wealth” statement until it went to claiming wealth flowing to poorer people. 

They just passed a trillion-dollars-over-10-years tax cut that almost entirely benefits the rich, and they’ll use it as a pretext for cutting services and raising safety net that everyone paid into. 

Bitcoin is small potatoes next to that. 

How many people are getting rich with bitcoin? And how does it compare with striking gold or oil during various historical rushes?

"Some teach this guy Economics 101. Since 2008, a large share of retirement funds across the United States have majority equity in their portfolio with hedge funds and VC funds also featuring prominently in this.

Don't get me wrong, crypto-assets will be one of the biggest safe havens in the next 2 years of near continuous decline in the stock market as people start taking out their retirement savings or what little they have left of them since 2008 burnt most of them quite badly. Expect the Fed's policy to basically mirror BOJ policy of the last decade of buying up more of the stock market to keep the market buoyant as it continues to collpase and take on ever larger amounts of debt which the US govt cannot finance.

To delude yourself that this will be greatest wealth transfer ever is to ignore the fact that millions of old people will be living off McDonalds in trailer parks and a greater propensity to elect populist leaders.

"You can invest in most assets with even a small amount of money.  
  
Larger exclusive funds are restricted by the government because they're risky (protecting you from yourself) and because your 5k investment isn't worth the cost of account management to a boutique fund.  
  
Crypto is the wild west and there are no rules, so yeah, anyone can buy it. But it's either a commodity or a currency: if it's a commodity then it's price is only driven by demand. If it's a currency it's price is driven by (perceived) utility. It is not an investment asset, no matter how sophisticated your trading software and your technical fundamental analysis make you think it's a real thing. bitcoin has one price driver: whether people think it will be useful in the future. It doesn't generate value and it has a mathematically defined deflation rate.  
  
Once someone develops a platform for e-commerce that makes all coins equivalent so that you can purchase anything with any coin then the coin with the lowest energy cost to run the block chain will be the only one worth using, and the absolute limit of how useful it will be will depend solely on its energy cost.  
  
At present MasterCard and visa can charge 0.5% on transactions so let's assume that's the floor. If a cryptocurrency blockchain can be more efficient than that it's value will appreciate, otherwise it's just a hobby for shills and speculators.  
  
The technology itself is cool and is a useful way to run order books, but that isn't bitcoin or any other coin.

"The difference is with Bitcoin people who save can erode the wealth of the 1%. 

Today, fiat is inflating at 3% if you save inflation diminishes your savings. The result of inflation is wealth continues to accumulate in the hands of the 1% who get the new money first. 

Those last to earn it pay the inflation tax and then they pay again when they try and save.

The bitcoin rich get only a 1 time advantage where the 1% in fiat are perpetually advantaged.";2;2;False;Adrian-X;dze6p9z;I think we are witnessing the biggest transfer of wealth of our generation as everyday peeps can now invest in crypto assets without anyone's permission.

Yeah, not really. Look what is happening already... We've got professional players in the game now. They manipulate and suppress prices and everyday Joe is selling out low after having bought high, while the manipulators control the markets and create the situations to buy low and sell high.

Americans , shit - people in general seem to love to be ruled over and told what they can and can’t do.  People don’t need to be free - they only need to be happy.

"Do you people think Hedge Funds outperform the market? 

I guarantee ""crypto redditors"" would do worse picking funds than flipping a coin on stocks. Tossing money at a speculative instrument in a single speculative asset class does not make you a sophisticated investor. 

If the general public was investing in hedge funds there would be cries to the government about how money managers are swindling little guys. People would be screaming for regulation, including most of you, because you would be losing money as well. 

You may think such idiots should be free to flush their money down the drain (as am I), but the reality is that people would refuse to blame themselves and welcome regulation as ""payback"".

But now it's an even playing field in terms of accessibility. Sure the 1% have a huge head start with capital but if they don't produce something useful they won't make money.

"> Look at the distribution of btc by total wealth per person.

That's the thing about Bitcoin. You can't. Analyzing the addresses doesn't provide any clear picture. Many big addresses belong to exchanges in which the funds represent multiple users, some big addresses are lost coins from the early days. Additionally many users have their coins stored in multiple addresses so there may be people out there more wealthy with small amounts in several addresses than big amounts in one.

We really have no idea what the actual wealth allocation is of Bitcoin.

"This just misunderstands how percentages work in income taxes and how the tax reform package worked. If rich people pay most of the taxes because of progressive taxation and you give all brackets about the same cut then most of the benefits will accrue to the rich because they get taxed at higher rates in the first place. It doesn't then follow that the tax cuts benefited the rich at the expense of tax cuts for the poor. 

Made up numbers but to illustrate my point:
A 3 percent cut to someone who is taxed at 15% of 65K a year salary is gunna be less nominal dollars than a 3 percent cut to someone who is taxed at 30% of a 300K a year. That doesn't even cover the cuts to business taxes which will accrue to the rich, BECAUSE THEY OWN THE BUSINESSES. But obviously it helps anyone who works for said businesses or buys their products. 

Now no doubt congress is terrible and spending way too much, see the omnibus and the recent annihilation of the Penny - Budget Plan. But that is a spending problem not a taxation problem.
