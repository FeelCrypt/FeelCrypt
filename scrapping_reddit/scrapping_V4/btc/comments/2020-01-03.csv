">But the society is not ready

Surely you mean this in jest, but just so people know... hardly anyone alive today voted in favor of drug prohibition. Marijuana became illegal some 80 years ago, and majority of US citizens (and more around the world) would love to see it legalized and regulated.  Yet it remains illegal. If this isn't proof that the government doesn't represent the people, then I don't know what is.
