On an unrelated note, making BCH the default payment currency would make a strong statement about supporting currencies that are meant to be spent.  I fully appreciate that decisions of this nature are very delicate.  That being said... be the change you want to see, right?

Second, I also run a non-profit that deals with public information, and as such I get a lot of DMCA.

"Okay, but it's not up to the small blockers to decide what the big blockers can do, that was the whole point of finally parting ways with the hard fork. 

Anyway honestly, the name Bitcoin Cash is the least thing Bitcoin \(BTC\) has to worry about right now.

Actually we do pay all bills at convenience stores in Taiwan. Digital currency is kept on cards and have access all over the island. From public transport, taxis supermarkets etc! I see this a just another method of payment. In Japan, this will be the tsunami of open regulations that other Asian countries will hav ego adopt or be left behind!

">Huh? The fact that they take many non-crypto payment methods doesn't at all detract from how hugegigantic this is, if true.

Not really, it won't be a true system, it'll just be a tie-in with an exchange, maybe several, in the same way that Bic Camera allows bitcoin payments, but only from a wallet on the bitFlyer exchange.

You absolutely cannot pay for things like utility bills, Amazon purchases, plane tickets, concert tickets etc with alternative methods - it's only cash. And it will always be only cash.

This will just allow you to buy other stuff like food and drinks with BCH. Which honestly is nice, but not that big a deal.";4;0;False;anothergaijin;e02ojmd;BCH will soon be added to tens of thousands of convenience stores in Japan!;8o88vo;https://twitter.com/BitcoinCom/status/1003234920590962688

"This is *huge* for me. Don't forget you can add funds to your **pasmo/suica** there too. Many taxis accept these.

So that's:

- **rail and Subway and taxi transport**
- utility bills
- Amazon
- food, drink, etc
- all those **gift cards** sold at kombini (iTunes, playstore, Amazon, etc)
