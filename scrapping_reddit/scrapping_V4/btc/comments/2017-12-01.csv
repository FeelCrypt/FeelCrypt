Which part is not true? BCH is at around 20'000/day, while VISA&Mastercard do ~10'000'000'000/day. If you want to scale to VISA then you must be able to handle 500'000x the number of current transactions. And if you want to do microtransactions on top of that, multiply that by another 10'000x at least. That's why it should be obvious to anyone that a simple block size increase doesn't do shit.

"> I’m holding out that BTC will adjust to become a fast low fees peer-to-peer currency as their philosophy atm are slow, but stable adjustments and changes to the blockchain/scaling.

A conservative increase to 2MB would have been that kind of stable adjustment - but instead, they pushed SegWit through.

The problem with your line of thought is that they argued 'status quo unless consensus by all major players'. Problem is that no more on-chain scaling will happen with BTC now.

We have all tried very long and hard to reason with Core - and now we got the divorce:

BTC is for settlements and BCH is for P2P ecash.

I know which one I give long term prospects.

And the miners are now incentivized to keep this differentiation in approach ongoing, which means that BTC will have no luck scaling further on-chain. BTC would need the miners to agree to that.

"**Metcalfe's law**

Metcalfe's law states that the value of a telecommunications network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system (n2). First formulated in this form by George Gilder in 1993, and attributed to Robert Metcalfe in regard to Ethernet, Metcalfe's law was originally presented, c. 1980, not in terms of users, but rather of ""compatible communicating devices"" (for example, fax machines, telephones, etc.). Only later with the globalization of the Internet did this law carry over to users and networks as its original intent was to describe Ethernet purchases and connections.

"No problem, please always feel free to ask questions here! (And if you don't get a satisfactory answer, feel free to shoot me a message, I may be able to join the discussion and help explain. I'm not an expert on Bitcoin, but I do consider myself an expert in explaining things.)

One of Bitcoin's cool revolutionary features is the idea of a ""distributed ledger"". Traditionally in ways of dealing with money, there would be one ledger (a list of who has access to however much funds), run by a money related institution (like an exchange, or a bank, or paypal, or venmo). That institution was a single point of failure for that system. If the company that maintains the ledger is compromised (by, say, the government, or hackers), then transactions can be censored, aka not allowed to happen, which is what happened with wikileaks, if I understand it correctly: paypal was barred from sending them donations by the government.

With a distributed ledger being maintained and updated by miners who are also distributed all over the world, that ledger becomes exponentially harder to compromise and censor. And in fact, wikileaks was still able to accept bitcoin, because nobody (not even the government) could stop the transactions from going through.

That distributed ledger is called the ""Blockchain"". The ledger is updated in sorts of ""batches"", called blocks, which are connected the the previous batch, making a chain of blocks, hence ""Blockchain"".

A little background on the above conversation:

This transaction history of the bitcoin network was originally only intended to be stored by those mining new transactions into the blocks. (In the original Bitcoin whitepaper, these mining entities were called ""nodes"".) Mere users who want to store and send funds can use ""SPV"" wallets, which are software that interact with the bitcoin network but don't require you to store the whole blockchain on your device.

Relatively recently, however, there's been a change in the narrative by the btc crowd arguing that  it's extremely important that **any user** be able to run software that keeps a copy of the ledger, on the grounds that it keeps bitcoin ""decentralized"", that it provides extra security to the person who keeps that copy, and it gives users power to ""vote"" in protocol ugrades. Those arguments don't hold water, however, and if you'd like to know why I'd be happy to get into it. But that's a bit too much of a tangent to dive into without making sure you want to read another wall of text =P";6;0;False;AD1AD;dqlijh8;"Mark Cuban: ""It’s going to be very difficult for [BTC] to be a currency when the time and expense of doing a transaction is 100 times what you can do over a Visa or MasterCard, right?”";7gpqfd;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mark-cuban-bitcoin-collectible-currency-152121444.html

Also, since 2015, LN has only been useful for only one thing: [this](https://twitter.com/BTCNewsUpdate/status/933352929817440257) and that is fact. Again, you will find multiple references if you look for them

To do that, they need to literally cripple BTC ([this](https://twitter.com/BTCNewsUpdate/status/927969435033497605) is one reference) to prepare to bootstrap their business off Bitcoin's brand. 

The crippling is probably going to be fatal to the Bitcoin brand but that doesn't matter at all. LN and Blockstream's sidechains are built for not just BTC but for many other coins too (LTC, VCT, Groestlcoin, etc.). In any case, once all merchant and payment infrastructure is lost by Bitcoin as it is diverted to LN, their system can and probably will work directly off fiat: no need for cryptocurrencies.

VC Investors have put very high risk capital into Blockstream in the tens of millions.

That's simply a lie and the lack of reference doesn't make this true. The lightning whitepaper was mainly written by josephpoon ([see here](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/paper/graphs/contributors)). He's not working for Blockstream. He's now working with Vitalik on similar scaling solutions for Ethereum ([source](https://plasma.io/plasma.pdf)).

What you're probably referring to is rustyrussell's contributions to the [RFC specifications](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/graphs/contributors), where he clearly has the most commits.

When it comes to implementations of the lightning protocol, we have 3 different developments going on in parallel:

- A version written in GO: [1](https://github.com/LightningNetwork/lnd/)

- Rusty's version (Blockstream), written in C: [2](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning)

- A version written in SCALA: [3](https://github.com/acinq/eclair)

- Blockchain.info's version in Java: [4](https://github.com/blockchain/thunder)

So, out of over [300 Core Developers](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/graphs/contributors), 11 are employed by Blockstream.

11/300+, is that really ""many""?  I wouldn't have thought so.

And, as your research has shown, Blockstream employees only make up 2 out of the top 10 all time, and 4 out of the top 20, in terms of all time commits.  So, not only are they not dominating in terms of body count, neither are they dominating in terms of commits contributed. 

And that's *all-time*, so it includes commits from the early days when only a handful of people were active on the project (so that they would have worked up a load of all time commits), and before Blockstream even existed.

If we look at commits from the past two years (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/graphs/contributors?from=2015-11-15&to=2017-11-14&type=c
), who from Blockstream is in the top 10 contributors?  Just Sipa.

Again, I think that Blockstream's influence is overplayed by some for the sake of a conspiracy theory.

For a slightly more sober look at Core funding, you might consider [an article from last year in Bitcoin Magazine](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/who-funds-bitcoin-core-development-how-the-industry-supports-bitcoin-s-reference-client-1459967859/).  It looks at the involvement of MIT, Blockstream, Chaincode, Ciphrex and BTCC, in a list which it describes as inconclusive.

When it comes to Blockstream, it mentions that 

> As part of their contracts, all Blockstream developers also have time-locked bitcoins to ensure they are incentivized to work toward Bitcoin's success. These contracts also include so-called “morality clauses”: If Blockstream asks any of them to work against what they consider to be in Bitcoin's best interest, they can refuse to do so while still guaranteed a salary.


The final question, I would ask people to consider is, if we disregard ALL of the evidence above and cling to the theory that Blockstream has had a malign influence on Bitcoin code, then how much Blockstream-influenced code has been removed from the Bitcoin Cash codebase?

So I did google it... and, unfortunately, I have to report that Bitcoin is NOT a legal ~~currency~~ tender in Japan according to the most recent regulations.

Japan officially recognizes bitcoin and digital currencies as a ""means of payment that is not a legal ~~currency~~ tender"" (see Article 2-5 of Japans's Payment Services Act (PSA) May 25, 2016) .

Specifically (translated):
——————————————————

The amended Payment Services Act defines Bitcoin and other virtual currency as

1. Property value that can be used by unspecified persons for payment of equivalent value for purchased goods, rental fees, or services, that can be purchased by or sold to unspecified persons, and that is transferable via an electronic data processing system (limited to property values that are stored electronically on electronics, excluding currency and currency denominated assets); or

2. Property value that can be mutually exchangeable for 1 above with unspecified persons and is transferable via an electronic data processing system. (Amended Payment Services Act, art. 2 ¶ 5.)

——————————————————

This classifies it as a property used as a means of payment but not a legal ~~currency~~ tender and not a capital asset. 

Most regulatory bodies I’ve seen classify it as a property (Japan does as well as it clearly states “Property value”) and taxed similarly. I agree that sale of property will invoke capital gains tax. In the case of crypto this is not so straight forward... especially on exchange/payment for goods. That would be a property to property exchange with no conversion to fiat and is more akin to bartering which is taxable in a completely different manner in every jurisdiction. Example: ""Proceeds from Broker and Barter Exchange Transactions"" 1099-B

Functionally, this wouldn’t be as easy as slapping a sales tax (or it could?)... a crypto to crypto exchange in the US would likely find itself in a “like-kind” exchange (tax deferred like virtual items in a game), but for all other types exchanges it may not be that simple.

"Well we have to disagree here about crypto currency being a capital asset. The reference for this would be here: https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-virtual-currency-guidance

The Notice 2014-21 which you can read here:
https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-14-21.pdf

Q-1:  How is virtual currency treated for federal tax purposes? 

A-1:  For federal tax purposes, virtual currency is treated as property.  General tax principles applicable to property transactions apply to transactions using virtual currency. 

Q-2:  Is virtual currency treated as currency for purposes of determining whether a transaction results in foreign currency gain or loss under U.S. federal tax laws? 

A-2:  No.  Under currently applicable law, virtual currency is not treated as currency that could generate foreign currency gain or loss for U.S. federal tax purposes. 

Q-7:  What type of gain or loss does a taxpayer realize on the sale or exchange of virtual currency? 

A-7:  The character of the gain or loss generally depends on whether the virtual currency is a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer.  A taxpayer generally realizes capital gain or loss on the sale or exchange of virtual currency that is a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer.  For example, stocks, bonds, and other investment property are generally capital assets.  A taxpayer generally realizes ordinary gain or loss on the sale or exchange of virtual currency that is not a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer.  Inventory and other property held mainly for sale to customers in a trade or business are examples of property that is not a capital asset. See Publication 544 for more information about capital assets and the character of gain or loss. 

So whether it’s classified as a capital asset is... maybe? This advisory was, I believe, released because certain crypto currencies would be considered securities under the Howey Test.

Let’s dig deeper and go to Publication 544
https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p544.pdf#page22

First Section 2. Capital Asset and Noncapital Asset.

So the answer is pretty straight forward if the crypto is considered a security per Howey test = capital asset... if not it’s just a noncapital asset.

For a framework and guidelines on which tokens are and are not securities... you can read the following draft: https://www.coinbase.com/legal/securities-law-framework.pdf

The conclusion is crypto currencies that are structured as simple contracts or license agreements are not securities.

*So, is crypto currency a capital asset?* The answer, I believe, is it depends... but I’m going to argue, for the majority of them, *NO* for the following reason... the majority are not securities and second this will set a precedent that is ridiculously difficult to enforce. Instead of crypto currency let’s use another similar digital asset that is used in trade and can [potentially] appreciate in value... virtual items in a game (property). Your suggestion would require that if a player “exchanged” one item for another item in-game (both of which have a market value outside the game) there would be a taxable event. Meaning you would need to record that... How would  that even be enforced?

This is why, I believe, there is a very robust section “Nontaxable Exchanges: Like-Kind Exchange” that defines very clearly the requirements to qualify as a “like-kind exchange”, which from what I’ve seen crypto qualifies as.";2;0;False;tenka3;dqli1a1;"Mark Cuban: ""It’s going to be very difficult for [BTC] to be a currency when the time and expense of doing a transaction is 100 times what you can do over a Visa or MasterCard, right?”";7gpqfd;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mark-cuban-bitcoin-collectible-currency-152121444.html

At the end of the day, people actually still use and sell things like gold. For example gold is minted unto collectable coins, it's used in medicine, electronics, art, etc. 

Bitcoin doesn't have any use other than being held onto, or used to buy something. Thus if it were to be deemed a currency, the idea is that people are holding onto it and investing in it so that one day it can be spent. However, if they never actually spend it, then it's not a currency, it's merely a store of value (since it would only be sold to convert into a curreny like $USD to then use to actually purchase something).

"Well we have to disagree here about crypto currency being a capital asset. The reference for this would be here: https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-virtual-currency-guidance

The Notice 2014-21 which you can read here:
https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-14-21.pdf

Q-1:  How is virtual currency treated for federal tax purposes? 

A-1:  For federal tax purposes, virtual currency is treated as property.  General tax principles applicable to property transactions apply to transactions using virtual currency. 

Q-2:  Is virtual currency treated as currency for purposes of determining whether a transaction results in foreign currency gain or loss under U.S. federal tax laws? 

A-2:  No.  Under currently applicable law, virtual currency is not treated as currency that could generate foreign currency gain or loss for U.S. federal tax purposes. 

Q-7:  What type of gain or loss does a taxpayer realize on the sale or exchange of virtual currency? 

A-7:  The character of the gain or loss generally depends on whether the virtual currency is a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer.  A taxpayer generally realizes capital gain or loss on the sale or exchange of virtual currency that is a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer.  For example, stocks, bonds, and other investment property are generally capital assets.  A taxpayer generally realizes ordinary gain or loss on the sale or exchange of virtual currency that is not a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer.  Inventory and other property held mainly for sale to customers in a trade or business are examples of property that is not a capital asset. See Publication 544 for more information about capital assets and the character of gain or loss. 

So whether it’s classified as a capital asset is... maybe? This advisory was, I believe, released because certain crypto currencies would be considered securities under the Howey Test.

Let’s dig deeper and go to Publication 544
https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p544.pdf#page22

First Section 2. Capital Asset and Noncapital Asset.

So the answer is pretty straight forward if the crypto is considered a security per Howey test = capital asset... if not it’s just a noncapital asset.

For a framework and guidelines on which tokens are and are not securities... you can read the following draft: https://www.coinbase.com/legal/securities-law-framework.pdf

The conclusion is crypto currencies that are structured as simple contracts or license agreements are not securities.

*So, is crypto currency a capital asset?* The answer, I believe, is it depends... but I’m going to argue, for the majority of them, *NO* for the following reason... the majority are not securities and second this will set a precedent that is ridiculously difficult to enforce. Instead of crypto currency let’s use another similar digital asset that is used in trade and can [potentially] appreciate in value... virtual items in a game (property). Your suggestion would require that if a player “exchanged” one item for another item in-game (both of which have a market value outside the game) there would be a taxable event. Meaning you would need to record that... How would  that even be enforced?

This is why, I believe, there is a very robust section “Nontaxable Exchanges: Like-Kind Exchange” that defines very clearly the requirements to qualify as a “like-kind exchange”, which from what I’ve seen crypto qualifies as.";1;0;False;tenka3;dqlhb8r;"Mark Cuban: ""It’s going to be very difficult for [BTC] to be a currency when the time and expense of doing a transaction is 100 times what you can do over a Visa or MasterCard, right?”";7gpqfd;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mark-cuban-bitcoin-collectible-currency-152121444.html

Under US law it’s not a currency but it’s been at least referred to and classified as an asset/property by the IRS comment on crypto currency. Therefore, by that definition, an exchange between like for like should be tax free (e.g. Bitcoin to Ethereum) and otherwise taxed as property on a sale (e.g. Bitcoin to USD).

"That’s a really great question and I think the shortest answer is that they actually aren’t.  Japanese people do not base the value of their money off the American dollar (they don’t translate it in their head before making a purchase decision). The average citizen couldn’t give two shits what a dollar is worth. They probably don’t even know what Yen would convert to in dollars. They just know that a Big Mac costs about 320 Yen. Make sense?

Currencies are kind of like languages in that people “think in terms of them”. Creating a new currency is like trying to create a new language. Sure maybe all the rules work and make sense and it’s a “better, faster, and more efficient way of speaking”, but a language or currency isn’t truly adopted if people keep having to translate it to the one they do think in terms of. I think it’s fair to say that what Mark Cuban is saying is that until enough people start using and thinking of Bitcoin as their primary money, it’s no more a currency than Pig Latin is a language.

"Glad I could be helpful!

> In the star topology you mentioned earlier, where `A` is a central node connecting `B` through `E`, imagine it connects to another star where `E` is the central node, with `F` through `J` as the points.

Okay, I had to get out my (digital) pencil for this one. So you're describing a network that looks [like this](https://imgur.com/2Jm7cfL)?

> `B` is connected to `C` through `A`, and connected to `G` through `A` and `E`.

Yes, that's correct.

> Can `B` close with `C` without also closing its channel to `A`?

In that graph, the only channel that `B` has ownership of is the `B/A` one. `B` could settle with `A` at any time and close that channel, but as that's `B`'s only channel, that would cut `B` off from making any Lightning Network payments to any of the other nodes (and prevent any of them from paying `B` via the Lightning Network) until `B` opened another channel with _somebody_ (could be `A` again, or anyone else in the network).

> Channel closings could potentially cascade in a domino effect

`B` closing their channel (`B/A`) would not force any other other channels to close. Perhaps `B` only joined this network to pay to `C`, and now that their transaction is done, `B`'s fine disconnecting, but that channel closing does not close the `C/A` channel, and therefore does not cut `C` out of the network too.

> Another question: since liquidity providers are valuable (if not essential), what incentivizes them? Do nodes charge fees for passing transactions through?

The logic I've heard is that any node in the network can set a fee that they'd charge to be the middleman (or one of several middlemen) in a transaction. I haven't heard of any plans to have set fees on a single individual channel (though the person you're in the channel with may be a merchant and charge you sales tax or whatnot). 

> What mitigates the risk of centralization?  It seems like there's incentive among users to connect to nodes with more connections, and more connections requires more liquidity.

The same logic that applies to mining; any miner can get selective about what minimum fees it would accept, but any community member could start mining and under-bid them. Same with Lightning Network hubs; anyone could start being a ""hub"" (there's no special functionality of a ""hub""; it's just a network node that chooses to open many channels to many people. Typical users only need to connect to a handful of other nodes, and in theory that will interconnect them with individuals/companies that are more highly interconnected, and the entirety of the network. The other aspect is that for a Lightning Network as a user, do you _need_ to be connected to _everyone_? No; you only need to be connected to those you want to make a payment to. You could open direct channels to those people/merchants and be done, and only maintain a few channels at a time. It's only people/companies that want to make it their job (to get a profit) being on the network that would need to maintain many open links (and therefore have a bunch of liquidity tied up in them).

> The conventional wisdom in crypto is ""don't keep your funds in a hot wallet, they're more vulnerable!"", so unless that's just nonsense, running a highly-liquid Lightning node entails some extra amount of risk, so it seems like there must be some incentive if we expect enough liquidity providers to keep the system running efficiently.

Well sure, hot wallets are slightly more vulnerable than cold wallets, but if you're spending the funds, they need to be in some ""hot"" wallet connected to the network. As an end user, you would still likely keep your life savings in a separate, cold wallet, and would have your weekly/monthly expenses (like the monthly Netflix example I gave) open in channels. And having a channel open wouldn't preclude you from using a hardware wallet to maintain the private keys used to open the channels (desktop lightning network clients would just need to call out to the hardware wallet every time they needed something signed), for good security.

For an individual/company intending to set themselves up as a hub/liquidity provider, yes it means more of their funds need to be committed to open channels ""just in case"" funds need to flow back to their connections, which is one reason them charging a fee is reasonable (since it compensates them for the risk they're taking having more funds locked into the network).

> My take-away from this paragraph is that implementation is going to be the biggest factor in Lightning's success; it's a complex system, and mitigating that complexity through a well-designed interface will make a huge difference in the amount of risk exposure that users face. As a late(ish) adopter, I'm lucky to have entered the crypto space with several user-friendly options--Coinbase, Exodus wallet, Ledger Nano S, etc.--but early adopters had to surmount significant obstacles. ... All theoretical issues aside, if the Core devs (et al) can bring something as complex as Lighting Network to the mainstream in a secure and user-friendly way, that will be an incredible achievement.

Oh, now you're making me feel old :) 

Anyone joining into the Bitcoin community now is still an early(ish) adopter, and while the price-focused individuals [will post memes of](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7gnorl/reminder/) ""If you can't handle my 20% dips, you don't deserve my 600% gains"", to some extent the same applies for the technology side as well. The initial intent of the Bitcoin software had the mentality of being a paradigm shift, where everything changes to a new way of doing things; start over and do things better. People joining in now still need to bear that in mind that the major changes aren't over yet, at least not from the Bitcoin Core team. Their development style I characterize as the Tortoise from the Tortoise and the Hare; slow and steady wins the race, and keeping their focus way ahead. (The counter-argument of ""but they could go a _little bit_ faster"" or ""focus on things happening a _little bit_ sooner"" is valid though too; some balance is needed there.) With that mentality, the analogy of how derivative technologies and behaviors evolved as the automobile gained popularity makes sense. Early adopters of automobiles had to grit their teeth through ""red flag laws"", and even after you learned how to drive an automobile (something _very_ different from anything else they would have done at the time), they then had to keep on learning new behaviors (like obeying a mindless red/green light at intersections), new security (how you secure a car is much different than how you secure a horse, and changed as cars did, from keys to security systems). There's still more changes to come, so adopters getting involved now should definitely not expect the learning curve to be done after their initial introduction. And myself as an application developer and interface designer definitely agree with you that Bitcoin as a whole is in an era of needing good interfaces that give users the ability to be in control, but with well-designed guardrails to show/encourage appropriate actions. The Lightning Network development has at least [three active teams](https://cdecker.github.io/lightning-integration/) working to make sure their separate implementations all work together, so we'll hopefully shortly have three different interfaces to start critiquing and optimizing for user experiences!

">So you're describing a network that looks like this?

Precisely.

>`B` closing their channel (`B`/`A`) would not force any other other channels to close. Perhaps `B` only joined this network to pay to `C`, and now that their transaction is done, `B`'s fine disconnecting, but that channel closing does not close the `C`/`A` channel, and therefore does not cut `C` out of the network too.

Oh, I see where I was confused now; I was still thinking in terms of the relationship between `B` and `C`, which is actually irrelevant to the network--`B` has no direct contract with `C`, so doesn't settle with `C`; for `B` the only channel that matters is the one with `A` here.  Got it.

>The logic I've heard is that any node in the network can set a fee that they'd charge to be the middleman (or one of several middlemen) in a transaction. I haven't heard of any plans to have set fees on a single individual channel (though the person you're in the channel with may be a merchant and charge you sales tax or whatnot). [...] The same logic that applies to mining; any miner can get selective about what minimum fees it would accept, but any community member could start mining and under-bid them.

Okay, this is what I thought.  So Lightning Network in a sense will create a competitive ecosystem based on transaction fees between level-1 and level-2, with level-1 fees effectively maintaining a ceiling on level-2 fees.  The floor on level-1 (direct blockchain txns) fees will be set according to the same factors that sets it now (e.g. how full the mempool is, etc.) coupled with the rate of channel openings and closings, while the floor on level-2 fees will be set by...well, I'm not sure yet what the major influences will be.  

But in any case, it seems like miners and nodes are now in competition for the fee market, but miners have no mechanism to improve their competitiveness other than somehow getting the community to support a hard fork that would make on-chain transactions cheaper...which the community has no incentive to support unless something causes the fee ceiling to rise on both levels (which I don't know how that would happen, since the costs to run a node will always be cheaper than the cost to mine, right?).  This isn't a problem as long as there is at least enough profit in mining to keep enough hash power on the network to handle whatever amount of level-1 transactions are demanded, but this does create incentive among miners to support alternative currencies that offer on-chain scaling methods that are competitive with level-2 solutions in terms of speed, fees, and low friction experience.  From a user perspective, all that matters (with all else being equal) are those aspects.

But then, miners could just run Lightning Nodes, too, so the question is, can they run them competitively with financial institutions?  I see now why the debate between level-1 and level-2 scaling methodologies is typically cast as a ""banks vs. miners"" battle.  Level-2 solutions pose the same problems as hybrid PoW/PoS systems, wherein investors can either opt for sinking capital into mining equipment or the currency itself.  The currency is safer and more liquid than mining hardware, especially specialized mining hardware, which means it will be a race to the bottom in terms  of network hashpower as LN profits rise relative to mining profits.  Seems like the result will be crippling the blockchain as much as the market will bear, potentially beyond that if enough users and miners flock to an on-chain competitor...unless Bitcoin goes full PoS and does away with miners entirely.  That seems like it may be an inevitable end-game in the move to level-2 solutions.

Hmm, it will be interesting to see how this plays out.  In any case, you've successfully answered my security concerns about Lightning Network, and the only concerns I have left are regarding how quickly and frictionlessly it can be implemented, and whether the community and network can handle the shift in incentives.  If hashpower flight occurs after LN adoption and makes it so opening and closing txns are as expensive and slow as on-chain txns currently are (or worse), and the community cannot transition quickly and effectively to another security model (PoS or maybe something else?), that is going to be trouble.  But perhaps that threat will be enough for Lightning Nodes to act in a way that keeps mining profitable or something?  Either way, there's bound to be more drama!";1;0;False;;dqmdszt;"""Bitcoin.com wallet now displays ""Bitcoin Cash"" and ""Bitcoin Core"" balances.

They are completely separate entities. This post is pro-Shitcoin (BTC). It was written as such to deliberately confuse newcomers into thinking its the same thing as Bitcoin, or that it is in fact Bitcoin itself. 

Just do your research and know what you are investing in. Shitcoin is close to failure as is. Its currently struggling to stay afloat by not being able to grow organically. The current inflated price has been due to artificial pumps by Blockstream et al. Also on 1/1/18, Shitcoin's price is known to plummet, due to Coinbase releasing 10% of the total Shitcoin supply. This will cause a mass sell off and be disastrous for Shitcoin.

Bitcoin Cash follows the original design/scaling plan, as Satoshi created it. It upgraded the temporary 1mb limit to 8mb. Bitcoin Core deviated from this plan, and instead made the temporary 1mb limit permanent, which generated network congestion for the last 3 years, which lead to a rise in fees, and made the network unreliable (during peaks, you can never know if your transaction will go through). They also decided to make 0 confirmation transactions unreliable, and added thousands of lines of code for Segwit, which is basically a solution looking for a problem, and adds an enormous technical debt to the project. They claim to protect decentralization, but the result was the opposite. They always said we should be able to run a node in a raspberry pi, but the mempool of unconfirmed transactions grows so much that it doesn't fit in memory. Meanwhile, BCH node runs just fine in a raspberry pi (Core devs claimed anything above 1mb was impossible).;26;2;False;WiseAsshole;dqm05um;Archive.org has received over twice as many donations ($4800) in Bitcoincash as compared to BTC.

"Bitcoin (Core) aims to have small blocks and off-chain scaling through the use of side-chains and the Lightning Network. The main argument is that large blocks will make storage and bandwidth costs too high for full nodes and that it will lead to miner centralization. They are completely wrong because storage is insanely cheap compared to mining equipment and Bandwidth is not an issue at all at the moment.

Bitcoin Cash aims to scale on the blockchain, meaning there are no sidechains or ""bitcoin banks"" that you have to give your money to if you want to avoid high fees; everybody can store and send Bitcoin inexpensively. They do this by raising the block-size over-time. They also plan to implement more tech to prevent blocks becoming full, such as Graphene which supposedly can make a 1GB block seem as though it is only 20MB.

I'll probably get downvoted but I don't care much so here's my take.    Bitcoin is the original network of computers that run under a certain consensus of rules to process their transactions.  a large portion of the network decided under consensus to split from the original network to create their own that was faster but still based off of the previous network.

"> I don't trust con men to improve BCH over the long term.

How can *all* of the developer groups on an open source project be con men? Roger Ver (I assume he's one you're referring to) doesn't control all development on this platform, or really any at all outside his website/app Bitcoin.com that I know of.

There's at least 5 development teams that I can think of off the top of my head that are working on some kind of new feature or upgrade to Bitcoin Cash. Someone recently posted a list with more than 10, if I remember correctly. This doesn't even account for all the developers we haven't yet heard of working quietly on BCH-compatible apps and other technologies on their own dime. 

You can't possibly tell me all of these people are con men. And don't try to convince me that that hundreds, potentially thousands, of independent developers are Bitcoin Cash shills selling vaporware to inflate this coin's value. While we're at it, let's discuss all of the evidence that the Illuminati are in on this too! 

I don't fault you for using both coins. I just recently started spending Bitcoin Cash and even got my mother interested in the technology by sending her a bit of BCH. I still hold BCore coins in the off-chance that I can make a big payout if the coin hits 15k, 20k, or some other crazy number. Yea, it's my savings account too.

"Not to toot my own horn, but I did. I made this comment about five years ago, I'm recording it here for posterity though it was originally made on /r/bitcoin back in the day. I believe it fits far better here now though.

My apologies to all for the childlike awe that may now be tarnished somewhat by the battles we've endured along the way, but what's a community without reminiscing every now and then.

*------First long form original comment I made as to why I was involved in Bitcoin and where I saw it going follows -----------*

 
A sliding scale of awesomeness;

Level 1) Circumventing payment processors **DONE**

Dependencies;

Bitcoin has a non zero value.

it is useful purely to circumvent payment processors, as a consumer this is a small boon as paypal visa and MC are somewhat annoying to deal with, but as a sometime merchant this is an off the charts enormous boon, as merchant accounts at banks are ridiculously hard to get and ridiculously hard to deal with. Once joe public small business owner figures out he can set up a reliable account as easily as it's possible something like bitpay, and the implications of that, PP/Visa/MC are in some serious shit. This *alone* is worth the price of admission for me but it doesn't account for the next levels where things get seriously awesome.

Level 2) Circumventing Banks and financial services **WELL UNDERWAY**

Dependencies;

Bitcoin has a non zero and not drastically trending downwards on a long term basis value, and that the cryptographic principles underlying the blockchain are sound (which if they weren't, would influence the value to a long term drastic downward trend, so really we could just roll that into the first part of the deps here). 

It is useful to not have to deal with banks and their 9-5 hours and large fees and random assorted ridiculousness that is the result of having a stranglehold on an essential monopoly market for so long that the average participant in the banking indstry's grasp on competition is theoretical at best. That you can hold your own funds almost zero physical footprint and no way for people to even know how much you have, where, or anything of the sort is a revolutionary ability never before available in the history of humanity, it will absolutely change the world when people figure this out.

On other financial services, with bitcoin payment and holdings it is now entirely practical to rely on bonds and insurance to hedge against risks rather than contracts, legislation and litigation. Truly free markets setup around the principles of it being in their best interests to operate in good faith are already springing up and are like to become par for the course when the model is validated over time. Any financial instrument or service that currently exists in the heavily regulated monopoly financial markets could be implemented with bitcoin. 

Hedge funds, investment banks, brokerages, managed funds, stock exchanges, bond markets, all of these things are due for a massive asskicking and I see it coming in a big way.

Level 3) Circumventing central banks and fiat money entirely. **IN PROGRESS**

Dependencies; 

Bitcoin continues to increase in value as the wealth of the world flows into the system and away from fiat currencies.

The entire global financial system at the central bank level is built upon attempting to force profits from a financial underclass that has a mathematically impossible task of repaying debt that continuously increases by definition. The fiat money systems of the world are quicksand by design precisely so on a macroeconomic scale the central banks can force market participants into loose monetary policy by increasing their inflation / monetary instability and making more and more investments look good by comparison. 

When the largest central bank in the entire world has committed to unlimited quantitative easing until the economy moves from its platform, the only sensible way to take this is as final capitulation. They will continue to inflate the money supply until they have people standing on other ground. They expect that the ""other ground"" will be stocks, sovereign bonds, other investments in the markets that they control but with the rise of bitcoin they may be in for a rude shock when their marks decide to entirely circumvent their game and move off fiat money and heavily controlled markets en masse. What we are seeing here may very well be the beginning of that.

Level 4) The euthanasia of the modern nation state. **THEY CAN SEE IT NOW, AND IT SCARES THEM, YOU ARE HERE**

Dependencies;

All of the above and the state proves completely impotent in actually stopping these things from happening.

The tyrants fall, the utterly corrupt modern business model known as the nation state whereby the ""customer"" is effectively just some mark in a given geographic area and all participants in the tax farm system are a cartel of nation states acting in concert to extract the maximum possible from their cattle ceases to exist. The complete inability to control the economy of the world by force leads to the death of the very core concept of the modern nation state; Making your customer's patronage compulsory.

In any argument with a strident statist, they will cede any ground, acknowledge any fact, go to any length at all to divert attention from the core fact that the state extorts its customers. If any other business behaved in the manner that all the states in the world do people would be up in arms and screaming bloody murder on a regular basis; States hold zero responsibility to their customers, the power the customer holds over a business is that if they do not see value in the product delivered they can choose to discontinue their dealings with that business. This is the last and final sanction of incompetence that the state, the final bastion of utter incompetence is completely dependent upon. 

Nobody who has the ability to actually refuse would take the deal the modern nation state offers, this is why they fight so ridiculously hard to prevent it even being an open question. But bitcoin removes the question from the realm of politics and inserts it squarely in the realm of mathematics. The statists can rail and scream and whine and complain all they want, but not a lick of it will change the mathematics of cryptography.

We may destroy the most bloodthirsty thugs the world has ever seen, and we may not even have to shed a single drop of blood to do it. I realise this is hyperbole and I speak only for myself and my opinion, but to me such a worthy goal without compromising at all on principles of non aggression may without exaggeration be the most spectacular accomplishment in all of human history. It is the ultimate manifestation of rejecting that the ends justify the means, going up against the greatest enemy free men have ever faced, and walking straight through him.

So, for me? I'll take any of these four levels, the higher the better. Even one is great, but all four? Nirvana baby.

"I think the market has already spoken.  While I don't agree that fees are good, there are two different use cases now forming: 1)  Those who want stability, safety and protection for their money away from banks & their low interest rates (use BTC) and 2) Those who want to transact with a crypto.  

In the second case there are literally hundreds of competitors that do it better than BCH (and BTC) but don't have all the underlying baggage.  If I want to transact with crypto, I would put in a nominal amount and then use it as required.  If you are hoping that it will increase several-fold in value at the same time, then there's a  conflicting argument.  Currencies require a stable price for you to transact with it.  An appreciating value will only encourage the ""HODL"" mentality and discourage people from handing it over except for ""significant"" exchanges.

We've been given a glimpse of the future, but forks of Bitcoin just aren't part of it in my opinion.  It is proven to be completely inefficient in terms of power consumption, not decentralized as claimed and constantly subject to attack from miners, developers and the community.  Luckily there are new breeds of crypto that address these problems which is why I think BTC will be the only ultimate surviving Bitcoin strain since it has the most divested interest to make sure it keeps ticking until the next breed takes over.

It's the future for large sums of money, but for everyday use, Bitcoin is not the answer. 

BCH has its advantages over Bitcoin, but it's still not good enough compared to some other coins. I think what BCH needs to do is exactly what you mentioned, dethrone Bitcoin. Not so it can become the new #1 coin with the biggest market cap, but to prove that Bitcoin can be replaced. We can't be narrow minded and refuse to allow another coin to take Bitcoin's place. We need to keep an open mind. We need to encourage better technology, rather than sticking with the inferior one because ""it's the original so it must be better."" And most of all we need to get rid of the idea that competition is bad. Competition is excellent, especially on such a massive scale. It leads to improvements by coins so they don't lose their buyers. And in turn, we as investors get better coins to invest in. The people who profit most will be the consumers. And believe me, nobody will ""consume"" Bitcoin if they need to pay $2 for some food and $10 for network fees. ";3;1;False;Xtrendence;dqlouht;"Alex: ""I invested in #BTC in 2013 when it wasn't cool.

"Exactly. Blockstream is motivated by profiting of their layer solutions and fees. They profit from a low blocksize limit. Thing is that, if you compare Bitcoin Cash to Bitcoin Core, then sure, you might be the preferred bankers choice as is the case for Bitcoin Core, but if all commerce go to one coin, then all that you are is just a symbol of the oppression if you are the coin that has the with the highest market cap  and the most acceptance by government and general adoption.

Because if the ""the masses"" might pick the coin that costs 1 cent to transfer and has a clear mempool instead of $2-3 transfers and long waiting times, then your choice was one that promoted Bitcoin as store of value and a tool for bankers and not commerce and cheap transfers on a global scale.

I think that technology always wins over politics. So, if Bitcoin Cash on-chain scaling is superior, it will break any institution that is set up against it. So I don't worry a lot, since I'm fairly certain it will happen. The problem is the reassessment of your predictions continuosly. 

But right now, if Bitcoin Core doesn't fix it's issues, Bitcoin Cash would  be chosen for commerce and Bitcoin Core might(?) be looking as use as store of value? Is commerce more important than store of value? I think you should look at the value of the stock market and gold to do that. Answer is obviously commerce.

"We're a minority by far. 

It's interesting actually, if you're familiar with the pareto principle I have a pet theory that says you can heavily bias your predictions towards a likely result in a given question by looking for that approximate distribution amongst opinion holders. 

All else being equal, if it appears about 80 percent of people are flatly wrong about something laypeople would find complex, and about 20 percent of people all grasp it quite firmly and make the same mathematically valid arguments in support of the position, the distribution itself can be used as contributing additional evidence that the 20 percent are probably correct.

The ratio between /r/btc and /r/Bitcoin pretty closely matches that distribution, diverging by only about an extra twenty percent, and in addition on a recent survey of opinions held by subscribers, about twenty percent of /r/btc subscribers were anti BCH, making the ratio fit even more neatly into place. In fact in a great many places within this debate that apparent 80/20 split keeps popping up.

"I’m sorry, but past performance is not indicative of future results. These people that made out well in BTC are just looking for the same experience (even trying to manufacture it, like Ver and team) via a mechanism that worked once for them, but the market conditions are not even remotely similar. There are going to be some seriously disillusioned people when they lose all those profits in the crash.

And it is coming. All bubbles pop, and the vast majority of these “geniuses” will lose it all because they believe so strongly in “hodl” when things are tolerable, but panic out at bottoms when shit gets really ugly.

Just look at all bubbles past, same dynamics: people made a ton on the way up, get over-invested and levered into the euphoria or side schemes hoping to replicate the results based on false correlations, only to have it all come crashing down on them.";-8;1;False;;dqlc6ba;"Alex: ""I invested in #BTC in 2013 when it wasn't cool.

"I see the point he’s trying to make but his argument just really doesn’t make any sense, crypto wasn’t nearly as big as it is now and maybe bch has a nice concept but there marketing just throws me off. Maybe they have a vision, an idea, or a plan, but this idea of marketing btrash as “the real bitcoin” is a disgrace to the crypto world. The random pump and dumps, the“bitcoin” wallet on the App Store,  and overall claiming BCH to be the real BTC is disgusting.

Now I’m not a bitcoin advocate like I’m well aware that it’s terrible but there are several other alternatives that one could use opposed to BTC/BCH but i think people need to accept that Bitcoin Cash will *NEVER* be Bitcoin. Maybe they would see more success if instead of trying to claim BCH as BTC and pitched their vision and plan instead.

"> Bitcoin was always supposed to scale on-chain by just removing the temporary small block size limit.

and:

> ... the Bitcoin white paper it's built upon.

and:

> ... Bitcoin Core Dev. team hijacked Satoshi's invention ... the defining white paper

Those statements are examples of ideology. ""Always supposed to"", ""deviation from originality"", ""hijacked <insert deity> <insert idea>"" are all examples of ideological non-arguments. I mean, MySpace did social media one way, does that mean Facebook did it wrong? I know, bad example for many reasons, but I'm sure you understand what I'm trying to say.

Look, you're not wrong. Not at all. And I agree with you (I think - I'm confused by many things from time to time with regards to technical issues beyond my comprehension). But I'm also allergic to non-arguments based on ideology. Instead of saying ""we should follow the whitepaper!"" as some sort of deity, the argument should be ""we should follow this idea in the whitepaper because the problem has already been solved theoretically, let's put that into practice"".

Points aren't being made, but rather the community is resorting to throwing shit at each other and shouting ""Nah uh! YOU are the baddy!""

Sad thing is, proponents of both chains have valid points. I'm not opposed to off-chain scaling, unless that off-chain chain (?) is owned by someone and not by everyone. Not because of ideology, but because of checks and balances, mind you.
