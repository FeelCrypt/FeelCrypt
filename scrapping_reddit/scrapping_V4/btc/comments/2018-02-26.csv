IRS already said they are going to accept BTC as a payment form for taxes. Although their policy is you have to wait for 24 hours of receipt of sending the BTC for them to confirm the amount and have that reflect against your balance.  Overpaying/underpaying will happen depending on if BTC goes up or down in 24 hours. However it is a step in the right direction towards adoption.

Thank you for seeing my perspective, but the IRS is not an intelligence agency or part of the justice department or even a local sheriff’s jurisdiction.  You’re conflating ideas.

The IRS is where the Secret Service derives from.  They quite literally work to create stability.  They check the books and they protect elected officials.  Congress funds the IRS directly.

We may want to yell at each other regarding which politician is the better choice, but bureaucracies like the IRS make sure things are stable.

To change the laws in our local jurisdictions or states, the bare minimum we have to do is vote.

"> Explain how you can send to multiple Bitcoin addresses, within a single transaction, while having less outputs than the number of destination addresses?

You misunderstand how Bitcoin works... the number of outputs lowers by (in general) the number of receiver addresses minus one. This doesn't bring the number of outputs to lower than the destination addresses, it lowers outputs to the number of destination addresses plus one, because a normal transaction doesn't just have the output to the destination address... it has one more for the change output.

Allow me to explain, and you can let me know once you realize your mistake.

Take a look at any block of transactions. [Here is a good example... expand the list at the bottom until you can see about 100 or so](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/block/510743)

You might see a couple of transactions [like this one](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/transaction/db33de197c7900b8b0787add2a0d8fef4a0e3d716ddf761a3ddb0dfb26dc056e) which only have 1 output. That means someone sent 100% (minus the miner fee) of the value of the inputs to a single output. *This is how you appear to think most transactions are: A single output... which means if you batch 100 them, you get the same number of outputs, 100.*

[Now go back to the list of transaction in the block, and look at the average output of transactions. Is it 1?](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/block/510743) **No, the average is actually over 2.** The main reason transactions have multiple outputs is due to how fees work.

If you have two inputs of 1,000,000 satoshis each, totaling 2,000,000 satoshis, and you want to send your friend 1,500,000 satoshis, what happens if you use a single output to your friend's address? *The remaining 500,000 satoshis go to the mining fee.* So what do you do to avoid that and pay a more reasonable amount in miner fees? You have a second output that returns the difference (the total input minus the receiver value minus the miner fee) back to your **change address**.

So now that you understand that, what do you think happens when you have 1,000,000 transactions, each with a change address output in addition to the receiver output? Consolidate that down to (for this theoretical situation) 1,000 transations with 1,000 receiver outputs each. How many change outputs does each transaction need? **The answer is ONE.**

Boom. You batched 1,000,000 transactions into 1,000 and outputs went from 2,000,000 to 1,001,000.

**tl;dr: Batching lowers outputs by the same amount as it lowers transactions, because of change outputs.**";1;1;False;Korberos;duuz7fk;BTC mempool just cleared out for the first time in 3 months!;7zd2tv;https://i.redd.it/hfc3lhwhuph01.png
"> still doesn't explain a drop from 400.000 daily txs to as low as >200.000 daily txs.

You seem to be automatically assuming that the average is 100 instead of the minimum. Let's do some math assuming those are on average 100 outputs, which is conservative but a good starting point.

The difference between September and January is 10931 transactions with 100+. Assuming 100, that's 1093100 transactions turned into 10931, so a drop in transactions of 1082169 per month. Assuming 30 days a month, that's 36072.3 transactions less each day.

Now let's do some real math. BlockChair allows us to export the data in a search so I exported those same months and go the actual number of outputs dropped.

`3507584 (September) - 2018654 (January) = 1488930`

`49631 / 30 (days in a month) = **49631 transactions dropped**`

Now, if we stopped here, you'd totally be right... but that's just taking into consideration 100+ output transactions. On top of that, a drop from 400,000 to 200,000 isn't really what we're talking about because that's the December to February drop which is more about the media rush ending... we're talking about the overall, where people are saying we're at 2015 levels of use because we're jumping between 150,000 per day and 200,000 per day.... but if you look at the average, we were jumping between 200,000 per day and 250,000 per day outside of the December media rush, which means batching **nearly perfectly explains the drop of 50,000 transactions per day.**";1;1;False;Korberos;duv0xo2;BTC mempool just cleared out for the first time in 3 months!;7zd2tv;https://i.redd.it/hfc3lhwhuph01.png

"It really does. Coinbase is only one of many institutions that implemented batching.

"I try not to make such sweeping generalizations. There is a market for solid, regulated financial services like lending, securing wealth, and facilitating transactions.

Investment banks (which have now largely merged with savings and loan institutions due to relaxed regulation on the separation of risk models) just seem to throw complex math at derivatives until they become complicated enough that they can sell them as a get rich quick scheme without being caught by simple, common sense analysis of the derivatives.

That's obviously a dramatic oversimplification, but almost all the crime is in complex investment banking, not in savings and loan operations. Even the mortgage lending fraud was driven more by securitization of loans allowing banks to pass forward the unreasonable risk they were taking a profit from. No bank would have committed that kind of fraud if they were on the hook when the bad loans defaulted.

Just remember that banking and bankers are valuable, but there's a damn good reason they need tight regulations on their business practices!";1;1;False;HackerBeeDrone;duv3m3v;Senator Elizabeth Warren accused JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon of illegal activities.

"You don't understand governance.

> No, the only thing causing single entities to have so much power today like Google and Apple is the government.

Horsecrap. They are *enabled* by governance to attain the statuses they have. Government could have prevented that consolidation of power and did not. Google doesn't need Big Gubmint to expand their power, they just need Big Gubmint to *not* prevent them from doing it, which they haven't.

> Bigger companies are better able to handle government regulation, legal battles, are more easily able to shut down competitors, are able to lobby for government-granted benefits.

All these facts are true *because* ungoverned consolidated power prevents smaller actors from being capable of these things, not because government prevents them. Government has the power to enable small actors but does not.

> Did you know that companies like Apple and Google hold thousands of patents, for no point other than using them to countersue if another big company sues them over a patent?

I sure did. Patents don't have a place in this discussion to begin with; it's a red herring that doesn't impact what we are talking about. Did you know that it is also possible to nullify a patent taken by a competitor that infringes on your intellectual property? Half these troll patents won't hold water in court if challenged, there just hasn't been anyone harmed enough by their existence to challenge them yet.

> This and a variety of other government forces lead to large companies being the most efficient in the current system. 

Incorrect. It is the *lack of governance* that *enables* large corporations and business entities to consolidate power. One - and only one - type of entity is capable of preventing the consolidation of power within private industry. That entity is government. If that entity does not perform the duty, it is not a failure of governance that leads to it - it is a *lack of governance*. No number of people through their commercial activities are capable from preventing a wealthy entity from conducting business. Boycotts don't stop a single-client business from operations. However, governance can and does stop antisocial business practice, when it is employed to do so.

"> All of those things disappear in the absence of government. 

You are completely avoiding my point. **What are all those things replaced with, in the absence of governance?** The answer is centralized fascism - which is even worse than competitive governance. Without government to create social consequences for behaviors, malicious actors are capable of acquiring and centralizing power on a scale far larger than they are capable of today.

> You keep repeating this, but you cannot just say something and make it true. You have to explain why. You have not done so.

Google *can't* do things they want to - things that would be highly profitable and very damaging to society, the freedom of information, Bitcoin, and global innovation - all because of pesky government enforcing accountability for business behavior and protecting human rights and civil liberties. There's a *lot* of money to be made in the harvesting and distribution of personal information - rendered unprofitable by *governance*. Google and Apple are prevented from selling your name, age, location and address, purchasing history, social media history, advertiser history, cell phone number, political affiliation, industry of employment, and every encrypted bit of data you've ever transmitted to every willing purchaser on the planet. The thing preventing them from doing this thing that would make them inordinate sums of money and leave millions of people vulnerable to identity theft or targeted xenophobic violence - the *one and only reason they don't do it* - is government. That's right - the consequences created by government are the only thing stopping those businesses from using your life as a pawn in a violent global game of money chess.

We have real-world examples of places where this government barrier between business and liberty does not exist and is replaced with a centralized coordination for personal gain at the cost of civil liberty. North Korea, Russia, Saudi Arabia, to name a few. The alternative to governance is fascism: either people establish a government by mutual agreement, or someone will take the position of power and become government by force.

"At least one of the 48 counts of banking and Securities fraud JP Morgan has paid tens of billions of dollars to settle under Dimon.

This included multiple criminal investigations onto Dimon that were ultimately dropped in a 13 billion dollar settlement (a small percentage of the profit JP Morgan made on the alleged fraud) both because the SEC is staffed primarily by former bankers, many of whom are friends with top bankers, and because they don't have the budget to sustain a criminal investigation against a major bank.

These banks are full of criminal fraud.

"Hey Rick, Fellow Pirate and SW Engineer here.
I think you're wrong about a few of your claims here, and I'd like to explain why.

Routing in LN is not analogous to IP Routing. 
It's not trying to find the best route, or even the shortest route. 
In fact as I understand it with the Onion Routing model, all routes are of equal length at 20 hops.
Furthermore, you actively do not want any of the intermediate nodes to make routing decisions, because if they could, then they could subvert transfers by making deliberately bad routing decisions or preferentially route transactions through their friends to create routing thickets amongst their friends for fee gains. The decision needs to be made at the sender.

Another thing, is that the liquidity requirement at each node doesn't change dynamically based on transaction flow.
Imagine route A->B->C->D (shortened for convenience, but really 20 hops).
A, as the originator must have the $5 that it wants to send.
A passes it to B, so now B momentarily has $5 more than before. 
B passes it on the C, so now B has $5 less again, and C had $5 more.
C finally passes it to D (the destination), who now has the $5 extra that was the intent of the transaction.
There is a liquidity requirement at each of the nodes, but it's about how much they stake in the smart contract that governs this.
They have to have staked more than the value of any transaction passing through them, because they have to be able to be punished harshly enough to ensure they they don't act like a bad agent in passing the value along.

In terms of routing then, there needs to be a way to propagate route fragments, possibly strattifed according to minimal node liquidity, that can be connected at the edges, to make route decisions.
The route fragments would be relatively static, because for them to change, the links between LN nodes would need to be reset, which would cost them an actual BTC fee, so they wouldn't want to do that too often.

Legal liability is an issue, but mostly for banks. 
Banks won't be allowed to run LN nodes, because KYC laws, and banks are positioned in actual countries, with actual bricks and mortar liabilities.
Individuals on the other hand will be able to run LN nodes in any damned jurisdiction they like, just because internet. Try to stop me. How would you even know?
I also find it a little weird the a Pirate like you is arguing for compliance with KYC laws that invade our privacy in such a fundamental way. IMHO, law enforcement should expend their efforts on attacking crime where it actually occurs rather than violating everyone's privacy in the name of catching criminals that they should have caught at the source of the crime in the community.

""Private keys online"" is potentially an issue.
I'm not really a smart contracts expert, but I note that to operate a LN node, for the duration of each LN node pair of connections, there are only two transactions that stay active for the duration, so (and I'm speculating here), you could probably provide the remote authentication for each LN node pair establishment, and from there it can run itself until one party to the link breaks it off.";1;0;False;PollyPirate;duukbik;Rick Falkvinge on the Lightning Network: Requirement to have private keys online, routing doesn't work, legal liability for nodes, and reactive mesh security doesn't work;7yfjkn;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFZOrtlQXWc
