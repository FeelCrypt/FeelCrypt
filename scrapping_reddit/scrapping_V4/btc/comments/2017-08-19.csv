">pushing for the destruction of BTC to make way for BCH

I don't think the sub is collectively pushing for this. I think there are some people who see BCH as a fast track to riches so it is in their best interest for it to succeed, and some people think the only way for that to happen is for 
 BTC to fail. Personally, I would like to see many coins succeed, just in the way that we have many possible methods to pay with fiat. I do not have any ill-will toward BTC. However, I think some of the most intense vitriol you witness is a result of some people feeling that BTC has gone in the wrong direction. There is a general feeling that the bitcoin community has been monopolized and co-opted in a clandestine manner. I do not wish to continue to comment on this. However, if you do some digging, you will most likely find that something is wrong in the BTC community, not just limited to r/Bitcoin. You must understand that many people who have been involved with bitcoin since the beginning feel that BCH is the 'true' bitcoin, and that bitcoin core has instead gone in the wrong direction.  I leave that up to you to decide how you feel about this. Perhaps we will see more information come to the forefront of the bitcoin collective consciousness in the near future. You should know that if I were to post this comment on r/bitcoin or even bitcointalk.org, it would be deleted by mods. I also wish to reiterate that a lot of what I am saying is based on what I have read others say on r/btc, and is not necessarily my own viewpoint regarding BTC/BCH. Remember, the love of money is the root of all evil, and there are LOTS of people in the bitcoin community who fucking love money.

"I disagree. I think you're being too reactive. 

SegWit2X came about from an agreement just among the most significant components of the Bitcoin Ecosystem (with the notable exception of the BlockStream Corporation, but they keep reminding us that they don't represent Bitcoin so who cares). 

That was just 3 months ago. 

The community has already done the first part of the agreement, activating SegWit, and now we're waiting to see if the rest of the community activates the second part of the agreement (the 2x block size increase). 

3 months is too quick to call something depreciated.... but it has been long enough for holdout elements of the Bitcoin Dev Community to make their true colors even more obvious. The 2x activation in less than 90 days will result in the SegWit chain falling apart (due to Dev and minor ecosystem player holdouts) or success. 

I personally think it'll fall apart and everyone will move to Bitcoin Cash... but if that happens, it needs to be because of those Blockstream affiliated holdouts, not because serious companies like BitPay 'changed their mind'. 

It needs to happen this way so those clowns that have ruined Bitcoin for the last 3 years will be disgraced and never be taken seriously by anyone ever again. ";7;1;False;DeftNerd;dlu9e3s;BitPay if you are reading...;6uo8oo;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6uo8oo/bitpay_if_you_are_reading/

Bullshit.

I used Bitpay myself years ago, when I wanted to make payments for my VPS. Back then, transaction fees were low and transactions were readily confirmed. It's now no longer possible to use bitcoin to pay for such purchases, unless you're willing to let a third party administer your bitcoin on your behalf.

They said that they're behind SegWit2x so they need to continue to back it. Stopping early would make people believe that they're unreliable in various ways.

What makes you think it's paralysis of any kind? BitPay is a commercial company and we have only a superficial idea of what their current plans are (emphasis on multiple plans that depend on external factors). 

We do know that they are one of the most economically significant participants in the NYA. I personally hope and expect them to go through with the 2x hardfork and I think it's really shitty that people here are trying to persuade people to pull out. 

I also recall them actively working on extension blocks and I would expect that they are still working on assessing the viability of that solution.

Switching their services over to Bitcoin Cash or any other coin is probably something they have investigated. But I'd be surprised if it's any higher than ""plan C"" at this point.";2;1;False;tophernator;dlu7wi2;BitPay if you are reading...;6uo8oo;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6uo8oo/bitpay_if_you_are_reading/
