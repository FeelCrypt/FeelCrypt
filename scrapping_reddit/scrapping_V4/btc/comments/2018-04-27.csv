"> Bitcoin Core is a useful name to identify the legacy chain. If you have a better name for it to remove the ambiguity with the client, then I'm open to it. 

""Bitcoin"" is the best term for the BTC chain as we always called it. There are over 20 UTXo split alts that did exactly what bcc/bch did , none of them are Bitcoin. 

even BCC creator Jihan with Bitmain disagrees and says Bitcoin is Biitcoin and Bitcoin cash is Bitcoin Cash.

"Hashrate follows market price, and market prices can be horribly deranged by clueless newbs in the short term. Erik's statement is equivalent to saying Bitcoin is whatever branch temporarily has the highest price *for any reason.* 

It's a completely untenable position, because every phase of exponential growth leaves the old investors as a tiny minority. It should have been obvious that as Bitcoin became more mainstream there would be times that newbs could be misled into supporting errant branches and thereby errant branches would at times accumulate greater total hashpower.

Nothing in Satoshi's writings covers how to deal with a situation where there are competing adamant factions, and the community at large simply assumed there would never be a reason to split where both branches of an experiment could have major support.

"Yes, but it would need to rewrite history. You'd need to convince the majority of full nodes to accept you version of events, even though they already have a history of events and they're only really open to changing the last few blocks.

I certainly think it's possible that if Bitcoin Cash becomes overwhelmingly dominant and the Bitcoin chain fades into obscurity, that we could just resort to just calling it Bitcoin without issues because it would be the expectation of newcomers that when they want to buy ""Bitcoin"", they would mean the majority.

At present, when people (other than a few diehards) say ""Bitcoin"", they do not mean Bitcoin Cash.

The lesson is, if you want to fork Bitcoin with new rules and get a majority, you need to majority before forking in order for people to generally accept you as the main chain and therefore be called ""Bitcoin"".

LTC has been around longer, has better real world adoption  and serves a similar function so it must be attacked instead of embraced for being years ahead of bch and helping to grow crypto and be a potential real product market.

"I don't think bitcoin cash is any more peer-to-peer than bitcoin. They both function almost exactly the same.

The only real difference is bitcoin also has potential second layers running on top, while bitcoin cash is increasing the block size directly. Which by the way increases the cost of running  a node and increases mining centralization due to latency. The result being a chain that is increasingly less peer-to-peer as the block size increases.

Trying to on-board an exponential number of new users with a linear scaling solution really doesn't make any technical sense unless you are ok with centralization pressure this puts on the chain.

BCH forked off too early.  BCH forked off without the economy, without the users, and without the businesses.  It had to build them all for scratch and, because 2x/BCH divided the people that wanted real scaling, Core got to keep them all for free.

That was a colossally stupid move.  Because of that, BTC has kept by far the largest amount of the hashpower, to the point where BCH will not be able to catch up in the next 6 months even if the cashening happens.

More recently, I haven't heard you expressing any qualms about how activated SegWit on the BTC chain only got added illegitimately, since the ""2x"" portion of the consensus agreement has never come to pass. ""2x"" is the aspect of the consensus agreement that raised support for SegWit1x from the 30%-35% that it had languished in for months (never once exceeding 40% support), to the overwhelming 90%+ support SegWit2x had at lock in time. This shows the crucial aspect for earning most of the miner support was the ""2x"" component, not SegWit alone. You present yourself as a strong believer of what's expressed in the white paper.

"I wanted to jump in to say that Roger and Bitcoin.com also supported the Segwit2x hard fork ABOVE the BCH fork up to the point that the 2x portion was terminated.

I recall a myriad of tweets and comments flying at Roger regarding BCH after it forked, but Roger didn't budge on his position to uphold Segwit2x. I wasn't in the room at ConsensusNY when the agreement was signed, but if ordering of signatures is an insight into anything, Bitcoin.com was one of the first companies that did so, and it seemed that Roger was not going to back down on this promise. Hell, their company stepped up and offered to provide engineering support for the devs coding the fork alongside Bitmain and Bitfury: https://medium.com/@DCGco/bitcoin-scaling-agreement-at-consensus-2017-133521fe9a77

This was corroborated further when Roger himself issued an update regarding all of the noise he was receiving during this period. (I recall it was issued as a PSA on their site, and I've been unable to find it via a light googling, but once I find it, I will be editing this post with a link to it). In this update, Roger stated that he was honoring his agreement with everyone, and regardless of what BCH was at that time, Bitcoin.com's full support was given to Segwit2x. This was after Segwit was activated, but before the 2x fork was due to activate. Roger closed the statement by highlighting his intention to see the agreement through UNLESS the 2x portion failed to activate. If this were to become the case, all of their company resources were going to transition and focus on BCH.

After the 2x activation was terminated, Roger held true to his word and began working on BCH. This company transition was announced via another PSA: https://www.bitcoin.com/public-service-announcement

You supported a potential hard fork, that's very true. You indicated this intention by signing the agreement alongside your peers, big blockers and small blockers alike.

"Saying ""Bitcoin Core"" is a useful and minimally offensive way to distinguish BTC now, from the chain that existed before SegWit activated and from BCH. In particular, it works because Core is the dominant software repository for that fork branch, and the only group allowed to make **any** consensus changes whatsoever. Calling either branch of the fork ""Bitcoin"" right now is simply less accurate. All other alternatives would likely be more offensive to those who choose to frequent /r/Bitcoin.

"That is why full nodes are so important, consensus must come from the entire community, not only the miners. Users decided with their nodes that Bitcoin + Segwit is more valuable than Bcash. Miners that were signaling for BU knew that they would lose money by mining the less valuable coin so they shifted to Segwit, that is the magic of multiple layers of decentralization, and not only the miners that decide. The coin is there for the users right? Miners only deliver a service, so it makes a lot of sense that users have the final say, and we learned that in this event. If you don't like it stay on Bcash, but don't call it Bitcoin because it simply isn't. I know that a Bcash full node will be soon too expensive to run for the common user, so Bcash doesn't enjoy multiple layers of decentralization. That's why it is a centralized altcoin.

"That's the big lie. It only syncs to the same chain *if you give up capability you previously enjoyed*. Specifically, if your pre-SegWit client ever saw an Anyone-Can-Spend transaction, you're free to spend it to yourself. Now, once SegWit activates, and you see a SegWit Anyone-Can-Spend transaction, you can again spend that and send it to yourself. But what's the result? You'd find yourself forked off of the SegWit chain. But you never made any changes to your client. So the fact that you get hard forked is because of the changes SegWit made.

"By every other criteria, I mean everything else expressed in the [Bitcoin white paper](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/bitcoin), beginning with the title itself. BCH is clearly ""A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System"", whereas BTC is actively making itself into a high fee, high friction, low utility store-of-value-only system. Key Core developer Greg Maxwell prominently toasted ""champaign"" to celebrate as transaction fees crested $50 just six months or so ago.  

The only criteria BCH does not yet have over BTC for claiming the ""Bitcoin"" name is total cumulative proof of work. And you're right, that's an important one. But I should also point out that you have to be a ""valid"" entity based on the rules of the white paper. Today's BTC has only gotten to where it is by pointedly and repeatedly subverting the white paper's prescribed Sybil-resistant Nakamoto consensus mechanism. This is no more obvious than in the fact that SegWit was illegitimately added to the BTC block chain. ""Illegitmately?"" you say? Yes, because the ""2x"" part of the SegWit2x consensus agreement was never added, so SegWit was essentially pushed on to the block chain in an end-run around Nakamoto Consensus. The ""2x"" aspect of the consensus agreement was the only thing that pushed miner support for SegWit from the 30%-35% range it was languishing in (never exceeding 40% at any point), to the overwhelming support SegWit2x had at lock-in time.  

So by that measure BTC with activated SegWit is not a valid claimant for the ""Bitcoin"" name either.

"I question if you know what a ***crypto*** fork is for the reason I stated.  Forks are intended by very definition to use the original name, and winner of the name is defined by hashpower and longest valid chain.  Whoever holds those traits gets the original name.  

Bitcoin is not ""core"", and they do not own it.  Bitcoin is not software.  It is a concept.  And in a truly decentralized system, development is also decentralized across multiple implementations.  

Claiming that a fork intended to redirect Bitcoin back to its originally intended purpose is 'misleading' or 'tricking' people conveys a complete lack of understanding of how all of this works. This is not the same as forks you may be familiar with. 

You already know why they chose Bitcoin Cash.  There needed to be a temporary name during the ramping up/transition period.  I too wondered how this would play out because humans tend to become familiar with a name.  So I guess if Bitcoin Cash wins hashpower and valid chain competition, Bitcoin will be called Bitcoin Cash in the future.  

Its likely that psychologically, people will view Bitcoin (BTC) as the slow, expensive Blockstream settlement layer coin that is now owned by Blockstream, and making them billions of dollars.

"Right, I was being very conservative with those figures. Ideally we don't just want a ""replacement for cash"", but we want to make microtransactions a viable concept.

For instance, the current web functions largely by publishers coercing users browsers to push their personal preferences to advertisers, and the advertisers compensate the publish for this. It's unethical, and neither the consumer nor publisher actually like the approach, but it's seen as really the only way to monetize publishing.

I understand that.  But again you don't get what is happening here.  So I will repeat for the hundredth time.  

*If a corporation came in and literally hijacked the bitcoin code, strangled bitcoins functionality on-chain to make themselves wealthy by forcing transactions off chain, and thousands of people were AGGRESSIVELY angry about this, would you expect the owner of the dot com to promote the corrupted version of Bitcoin, or the fork intended to salvage its original meaning?*

How minimal and silly is the ""temporarily confused noob"" complaint when Bitcoins ability to free people from corrupt governments, and provide financial sovereignty has taken a back seat to making Blockstream rich?

*Where do your priorities lie?*

Noobs will see both mentioned, and are capable of reading up on the corporate hijacking of BTC.  Hopefully they'll decide to buy BCH as a result, if they have an ounce of ethics, and standards.  

This is not a random thursday in bitcoinland.  There is a war waging for the identity of Bitcoin.  And the name.  Its absurd to whine about something as pithy as ""noob confusion"" when people are suffering due to this delay introduced by Blockstream [for their own benefit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFOmUm-_DMQ).

"Sorry but you are confusing decentralization with p2p. If Jihan was the only miner and never censored txs is bitcoin still p2p? Yes. And if Jihan decided to censor by leaving txs dangling in the mempool he would incentivize new entrants into the market because anyone with the resources can mine. 

Because I can't put it any better than this guy: 

""The block size is basically orthogonal to the proof-of-work, and the proof-of-work is distributed in the sense that anyone can do it. There is nothing stopping any entity from doing the proof-of-work if they have the resources and capabilities. So this idea that there will be one company that is the only one doing Bitcoin doesn't really make sense if it's cost competitive for other companies to be involved. Yet the boogeyman of centralization is repeated in censored forums. It misunderstands the bitcoin’s central economic conceit: it’s the greed of the miners that makes bitcoin work.

""End users can still validate transactions via SPV, which is completely valid and provable without storing the entire block chain. Consensus relay nodes can do the same thing, although they will start dropping off the network when the bandwidth costs become prohibitive. So in a small block system we have an extremely limited amount of space for transactions, which means the cost will eventually be excessively high and result in settlement between big players. That's the choke point that allows for KYC and AML. You can submit a transaction to the network, but you can't afford to because there isn't enough bandwidth to service your request so you are forced into regulated channels, onto exchanges, or through third party choke points that can be audited. 

""People who want small blocks for Bitcoin really need to be thinking about using an altcoin, it was never in the plans to have an extremely low bandwidth pipe to keep things decentralized when the proof-of-work is by default a centralizing force."" *

Centralized  BUT still p2p. To the contrary LN is NOT p2p. It bottlenecked into hubs from the moment it was born and that will only get worse.

"> When it failed to materialize, he should have immediately gotten behind BCH.

This is the folly of BCH forking 3 months BEFORE segwit2x failed.  BCH became a joke amongst the moderates and the Core supporters; Because it barely had any momentum - far less than it has today - it wasn't taken seriously by any businesses and most miners.  Coinbase, run by longtime bigblockers, said they wouldn't support it at all or allow it for trade.  Even Jihan said he wouldn't mine it until after others started.  Jihan also states that it is not Bitcoin.

When you fork too early while many of your potential supporters are still supporting a different alternative, you create problems.  BCHers were warned of this and ignored it.  They have their reasons for doing that, which I don't agree with, but the reality remains the same, and that's how we got here today.

> Can you define this term for me? I have opinions about it but I'm curious what you think.

A mainnet proven ability to keep fees at a low amount under high transaction loads and while still processing transaction confirmations in a timely fashion.

Core had the chance to do this and utterly failed in December, along with multiple failures before December.  I believe BCH's bigger blocks will perform fine, but it hasn't been real-world tested other than with Ethereum - Which is quite a bit different due to its faster blocktimes.  Ethereum choked a bit but did clear through and recover much smoother than Core.  That was also Ethereum's first real test whereas it was Core's 5th or 7th or so.  I eagerly await the real world test of BCH's capacity.

"Your continued gaslighting that we are ""tricking"" anyone does not fly considering almost every facet of the white paper and it's designed mechanism for evolution backs BCH as ""Bitcoin"" over present-day BTC.  

As a developer, you should realize if you can't operate within the bounds of a white paper, you have no business claiming what you are doing is part of that project. For Bitcoin, it actually goes further, since Nakamoto Consensus allows any manner of legitimate evolution and deviation from the original design laid out by Satoshi through a truly Sybil-resistant consensus evaluating mechanism. However, it's clear that present-day BTC was only able to get to where it is now via Core and collaborating censors cheating and subverting this mechanism: even stronger proof that today's BTC rejects everything the white paper defined as ""Bitcoin"". Not true, you say? OK, then tell me where the ""2x"" part of the SegWit2x consensus agreement is for the BTC block chain? Without it, SegWit inclusion is illegitimate and was backdoored in to subvert the Sybil-resistant aspect of Nakamoto Consensus (the 2x aspect of the consensus agreement was the only thing that was able to garner overwhelming miner support for SegWit inclusion).

"If you actually understood what a fork is, you would understand what Roger is doing.  I will say what I said to someone else 10 minutes ago:

-----

*Think of a scenario where Bitcoin actually did end up hijacked by developers who were doing something that thoroughly offended you.  Maybe selling Bitcoin to the highest bidder in corrupt governments.  Pick a scenario.  Get offended by it.  Get enraged by it.*

*Now how would you, and thousands of others deal with that.  Well ... you would use the feature called forking.  And your purpose in forking would be obvious.  To reclaim Bitcoin from corrupt developers who have been bought off by corporations and governments right?*

*In this scenario you *care* about ***Bitcoin***.  *You believed in bitcoin for 8 years, and you put your life behind it, and hoped for the change it would bring.  And Bitcoin's name is famous now. And has power to change, but those in power ended up killing it.*

*So you fork.  Right?*

*Now ... would you name the fork Bitcoin, or something else that has no recognition, and no ties to your actual project? Would you let corrupt people steal the name from its original goal?  No.  You would fork, and as with forks, you'd call it fucking Bitcoin.*

***Given ALL of this context, would you really have a problem if someone (LUCKILY!) owned the official dot com for Bitcoin and put your fork front and center as part of trying to reclaim Bitcoin away from corruption?***

-----

No.  You wouldn't.  And if you claim otherwise, you are being dishonest.   What Roger is doing is perfectly rational, given the context.  Taking the name is perfection rational, given what is going on.  And straight-up REMOVING it from bitcoin.com is also perfectly rational, if he chose to do it.   

Why?  Because of what I just explained above.  Think about it.  Its not deception.  Its not misleading.  Its a very deadly serious ideology difference and this is a free market open source situation where a Corporation has strangled on-chain scaling for their own profit goals.   I can't think of a more offensive attack on Bitcoin.  And I support anyone who exercises their right to vote against it.

"I have to disagree. The white paper clearly makes most cumulative proof of work the arbiter of what exactly is ""valid"" for ""Bitcoin"" (well, aside from the part where Satoshi conflates the longest chain with most cumulative proof of work). So even if someone made all the changes you describe, if that implementation earns the most cumulative proof of work, then by Nakamoto consensus, those are now the ""valid"" rules.  

Personally, I'd add a few other restrictions for what could legitimately be considered Bitcoin. For instance, a candidate would need to issue from the original Bitcoin Genesis Block, and would still need to use SHA256 proof of work (barring some flaw or mathematical advance that renders the algo unsuitable).

"> The chain with the most PoW is not per se the ""real"" chain.

I disagree.  I say,

> It is strictly necessary that the longest chain is always considered the valid 
one. Nodes that were present may remember that one branch was there first and 
got replaced by another, but there would be no way for them to convince those 
who were not present of this. We can't have subfactions of nodes that cling to 
one branch that they think was first, others that saw another branch first, and 
others that joined later and never saw what happened. The CPU power 
proof-of-work vote must have the final say. The only way for everyone to stay 
on the same page is to believe that the longest chain is always the valid one, 
no matter what.

(Ok, I didn't really say that, but whoever said it, they were right)

If miners are able to

> make a fork of bitcoin that removes the 21 million cap, reduces the blocksize limit to 50KiB and allows arbitrary TX reversals by a third party, and somehow base it on the existing chain **and accumulate more PoW**

then that will be Bitcoin.  I bolded that last text because obviously it's trivial to code up the changes you suggest.  What would not be trivial is convincing the market to pay ~$10K/coin for these new coins being mined, which is the **only** way to accumulate more proof of work.

But.  You were the one who proposed that the market would pay more for these new coins being mined when you said that the new chain would get more proof of work.  That's baked into your assumption.

So.

"> ... only among nodes that follow the same consensus rules.  

According to the white paper, I think this is backwards. The most cumulative proof of work *establishes* which rules are valid according to consensus, and that's how Bitcoin is designed to evolve.  

So for Bitcoin Cash, we're currently trying to become ""Bitcoin"" by achieving most cumulative proof of work. In other words, BCH is demonstrating the process of Nakamoto Consensus in action, but it's still in the midst of trying to earn that consensus. If BCH never achieves most cumulative proof of work, it not only wouldn't be ""valid"" per the original ""Bitcoin"" white paper, there should probably be an addendum to the white paper written up legitimizing its own consensus rules in order to document what's ""valid"" for Bitcoin Cash, and how it can evolve by its own mechanism. That new document would then be the ""Bitcoin Cash White Paper"".

"Your stance on most accumulated work defines bitcoin is nonsense.

1) Suppose the majority of miners would go and mine a chain that had the 21-million coin limit lifted, would you consider that Bitcoin then? No of course not. It's a consensus rule regarded as sacrosanct, you wouldn't care that that chain has more POW, it's meaningless.

2) Suppose hypothetically a sudden and massive shift in hashpower would happen and BCH where to gain the majority hashrate. BTC would still have more accumulated POW, but it'd be functionally dead because barely any blocks would get found, nobody could use it at all. The time to difficulty adjustment would recedes to infinity while the price crashes to near zero before it becomes so illiquid you can't trade it at all. Would you still consider that Bitcoin then? No of course not.

3) Suppose aforementioned hashrate calamity would happen forcing BTC to hardfork to introduce at least a dynamic difficulty adjustment such as the one that exists in BCH. They'd still have more accumulated POW but far less hashrate, but would you still consider that Bitcoin? Well maybe, but then, why isn't BCH?

4) Same supposition on the hashrate calamity, do you think it'd make people who've already decided there's no other Bitcoin than the one BSCore peddles accept something else as Bitcoin? Well of course not, then why should people who accept BCH as Bitcoin be any different? Why don't we have the right to reject what BSCore has done to Bitcoin and reclaim what we understand Bitcoin to be and say it is Bitcoin?

5) SegWit coin is on a functional level incompatible with Bitcoin. The reason is simple, a miner that is unaware of the extended block section and consensus rules (i.e. mines the original Bitcoin), will accept a transaction that violates SegWit rules and include it in a block. This block will then be rejected by SegWit miners. From the miners perspective this is no different than a hardfork. I.e. SegWit is effectively a hardfork, just as hardforks are hardforks. Just because something hardforks doesn't mean it's no longer what it used to be. BCHs hardfork was forced upon it because of SegWit. It was the only viable way to retain what Bitcoin is in the face that the majority of hashrate decided to mine something that wasn't.

----

Furthermore your stance on not supporting BCH is bullshit. Here's why: More than 2 years ago you said you'd support **a** HF away from Core's leadership. You didn't qualify your statement to mean ""only if the majority of hashrate supports it"" or any such thing. You tried your version of such a HF with SegWit2X, which failed. It didn't fail on account of minority hashrate, it failed altogether to attract any hashrate whatsoever. There is a fork that has some respectable/functional hashrate and that is BCH. Back 2 years ago you didn't qualify your statement as ""but only if it's the fork I make"". You said **a** fork. Well now we have **a** fork, that works, and is supported by some amount of hashrate, but still, you won't support it?

"From the white paper:

>The proof-of-work also solves the problem of determining representation in majority decision making. If the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it could be subverted by anyone able to allocate many IPs. Proof-of-work is essentially one-CPU-one-vote. The majority decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested in it. If a majority of CPU power is controlled by honest nodes, the honest chain will grow the fastest and outpace any competing chains. To modify a past block, an attacker would have to redo the proof-of-work of the block and all blocks after it and then catch up with and surpass the work of the honest nodes. We will show later that the probability of a slower attacker catching up diminishes exponentially as subsequent blocks are added.

My understanding is that POW is a decision making system which only applies to chains **following the same rule set**. The total POW 'truth concept' is not applicable to chains post hard fork as the communities have decided to go their separate ways. Therefore, there is neither a need for inter-hardfork decision making post-fork nor a possibility that post-fork chains could ever reach consensus by definition.

I think Erik and others have this wrong.

In any case it's probably not necessary to spend much time on. He may simply not have liked this particular fork as much as he did SegWit2X.

In regards to which is the ""real"" Bitcoin, the difference is that some do not accept the SL chain as being the majority chain in context of all of the requirements. 

Such as SegWit by some not being considered the chain of signatures defining a coin in the design and introducing a risk to the network, hence also to legacy addresses. Or even varying properties, such as the very important one of having a low fee which is influenced by another variable, the blocksize.

In any case Bitcoin BCH is never Bitcoin BTC at the same time and the properties of both systems make it clear what we are speaking of.

"It's not the longest chain that matters in the short term. 

What matters is adoption - the so called *economic code* of Bitcoin. If you win the network-effect then eventually you become the most profitable to mine, and will in future end-up accumulating the most aggregated pow. 
 
The way to do this, is to be ready to take the transaction load when/if BTC fees again rise to some ridiculous amount, without any safety-valve with layer-two/Lightning. BTC devs have backed themselves into a corner on this topic.

Also (and more controversially), someone is going to do second-layer stuff right at some point - but it is not clear this will happen quickly with vendors already leaving the system.

"We really should stop obsessing about Twitter on-liners. But it's also important to point out the following:

The chain with the highest accumulated proof of work is the authoritative chain, but **only among nodes that follow the same consensus rules.**

Once you have a planned split such that there are two sets of nodes, each set having its own consensus rules, **each set has its own longest authoritative chain**.

At that point we need to distinguish between the two sets of nodes. So we will need a hierarchical system, just like Internet domains. Just as you can have domains bitcoin.org and bitcoin.com, the identical labels ""bitcoin"" being in two different domain hierarchies, so can you have identical coins called Bitcoin, so long as we use some label to distinguish between the two sets of nodes.

So we can call one set of nodes the Core nodes, and another the Cash nodes. And the longest chains can then be called the Bitcoin Core chain and the Bitcoin Cash chain respectively. Within each set of nodes, so long as the context is clear, we can simply refer to the Bitcoin chain without ambiguity. But globally we will want to always use the longer names Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Cash.**‡**

"Ugh, that hurrrts.

Lesson to take from it:

1.) Maybe we should stop being annoying to some people who already made their mind?

2.) Miners are important. We know. High fees at btc chain will indeed secure miners profits and attention. Bch is moving cost of transaction from users towards miners. There is no incentive for them to switch to bch unless its difficulty is low and require small resources to mine, or.....we gain enough users to convince miners that bch has future to exist and grow!!! Btc with current model might never go above its ath price and adoption. It has hit the ceiling lately and now is a little under, but not much space to grow.

Let's focus on adoption.

3.) The Bitcoin failed to gain majority of miners. I agree to that, but is gaining them. Let's gain users first though.

Edit: I would like to add, that currently btc is still powerful even though failed its purpose. If you think about it, as much as costly, it is still easy to sell btc to fiat pretty much any amount within 30 minutes. I can find buyer or seller to meet face to face probably in similar period of time. With bch things are much much harder. There is less of us. There is big propaganda against us. Our chain is better in every way, but we have soooooo much to do. Don't waste time.

"Not really. Theres a small window of opportunity when you fork to convincingly claim the name. Either you kill off the original chain, or the original chain is left in a completely inoperative state, with no exchanges accepting it, little to no hashpower, no usage etc.

The bitcoin name doesnt flip-flop between chains just because hashpower changes. Thats an absurd concept. Imagine it:

> ""Well I had 1 bitcoin that you transferred to me yesterday, but today I have none because its no longer bitcoin. X is now bitcoin. Y might be bitcoin the day after"".

or

> ""Breaking news: Bitcoin transactions from 1 aug 2017 till now have been rolled back. A new history of bitcoin transactions have been established, as the old bitcoin is no longer bitcoin because that other bitcoin has become bitcoin"".

Segwit2x had a chance at becoming bitcoin. If all exchanges and vendors had accepted it, and hashpower left the 1x chain I'd have to call it bitcoin.

But when you fork off, call it bitcoin cash, change the difficulty algo to not die a fast death, wait months and months with no sign of ""flippening"" no one serious is going to view it as bitcoin no matter what happens.

That's the aspect of the consensus agreement that raised support for SegWit1x from the 30%-35% that it had languished in for months (never once exceeding 40% support), to the overwhelming 90%+ support SegWit2x had at lock in time. This shows the crucial aspect for support was the ""2x"" component, not SegWit, and therefore the BTC block chain with activated SegWit but no ""2x"" is not valid in claiming the ""Bitcoin"" name per the white paper's own expressed consensus mechanism.";1;0;False;AcerbLogic;dy2asg3;Erik Voorhees: “Roger - please stop referencing me to back up your opinion that Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin.

"A fascinating argument that I do not entirely disagree with. The whitepaper talks about a single chain split, i.e., two competing chains, but not a network split, i.e., two disjoint sets of nodes.

Chains can split multiple times, like bacteria, leading to many subchains. At some point you might have two sets of chains, and a close competition within each set, but the two sets might be long-lived **if for some reason the nodes themselves split into two sets**. A set of nodes A might only be looking at a set of chains A. Likewise a set of nodes B and a set of chains B.

Now within set A, chains compete for the status of longest chain. In parallel, within set B, chains compete for the status of longest chain. But since the nodes exist in two different sets, there is no competition between the longest chain in set A and the longest chain in set B.";1;1;False;ray-jones;dy1zlcn;Erik Voorhees: “Roger - please stop referencing me to back up your opinion that Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin.

Bitcoin Core did not 'steal' the name bitcoin. Bitcoin Core just implements  a Protocol and the name Bitcoin stays with the most accumulated work of any chain that originates from the genesis block.

"> Segwit transations didn't exist, so saying ""invalid segwit transactions"" makes no sense.

That is incorrect. Please stop spreading lies. An old miner can and will include a SegWit transaction, it just won't know how to handle it.

There are numerous guides, and numerous guides were posted, about needing to have a SegWit-aware edge node, or you'd run the risk of losing your block reward if you mined a transaction that was invalid.

If SegWit needed an upgrade on miners/nodes, that makes it a fork. Was it an hard fork? No, it didn't add anything that was previously invalid. Therefore, it was a soft fork. What was made invalid? SegWit transactions, that previously weren't processed just included, that weren't valid under SegWit rules.

It's that simple. No they weren't understood, yes they were included, and if they were invalid since a SegWit-unaware miner included them, the block would be dropped by SegWit nodes and miners.";1;3;False;Okymyo;dy1r9iu;Bitcoin Cash is upgrading on May 15 to 32MB max block limit;8el8n7;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8el8n7/bitcoin_cash_is_upgrading_on_may_15_to_32mb_max/

Still requires an upgrade to be aware of segwit, thus making segwit mandatory.

Whoever controls the nodes now controls which forks are accepted, since node-activated soft-forks have been shown to work and to be loved by the community.

I would argue (perhaps against general sentiment) that value isn't what we should strive for with BCH. We want a long chain. We want transactions.
