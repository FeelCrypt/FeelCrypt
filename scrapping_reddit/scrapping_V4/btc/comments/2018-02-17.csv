Actually it seems this is an op-ed (contributor type) piece, not a Roger Ver transcription. So it is not an ""official"" position as I thought (whatever that means in thebig block/small block debate) However it is pretty much the only argument I see being made: ""LN is centralised, censorable, handing power back to big banks and not as secure as transacting on chain""  
All of these are demonstrably false     

If I have showed a false understanding of LN nodes or mining nodes then I'd love to hear it. I understand there are differences between LN nodes and mining nodes but there are also similarities, and it is funny to hear the arguments  from /r/btc made *for* mining centralisation turned on their head to argue against LN nodes when the same game theory incentives apply to both. Bad actors are rejected by the networks. Alternative routes are available on both. The LN nodes can not just disappear with your funds, just as miners cannot.   
It seems the concerns over LN are just clutching at straws by people who primarily support big blocks and BCH. I'm willing to hear good arguments but all I hear are fallacies

You completely miss the point. Code cant be controlled. If you ever get to a point where you believe the code dont serve you ant longer, you run something else. But thats only really possible if you can actually run a full node and follow a different chain, hence our discussion earlier. If you want to control bitcoin you cant have people just being able to run some software you dont like.

It is probably not on the timescale in which people want us to implement something, but we would rather do something right than do something fast, and code stability is important.

There is one other considerations that we also care a lot about, and that is compatibility with other Bitcoin like cryptocurrencies. We are aware there are a lot of battles being fought in the space among the various cryptocurrencies out there, but in keeping with our mentality of neutrality, we plan to support all coins which have significant support from our userbase. 

For this reason, we want to find (or build) a solution that can easily be extended to any cryptocurrency out there, otherwise, we would be forced to embark on a major dev process each time we want to add a cryptocurrency.

"Hey there and thanks for your hard work on creating the most private email service in the world!

I very much ask you to look at [BIP47 Reusable Payment Codes](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0047.mediawiki) technology as a way to organize payments from clients to your service. It’s a bit complicated technology to describe in few words but your engineers will definitely be able to fully get it.

Once implemented it will work as follows:

1. You client wants to become a premium member and pay with bitcoin cash (this technology is extensible to natively support all bitcoin-like cryptocurrencies)
2. He enters his Payment Code inside his account billing settings, and copies yours and adds it as a contact inside his wallet.
3. He makes a Notification Transaction to your payment code, which you can outright detect and associate with his account **automatically**. This transaction is purely technical and does not carry any value except a tiny (in case of bitcoin cash — negligible) fee.
4. As soon as the Notification Transaction is sent you can show a green tick as a sign that the setup is finished.
5. From that moment, you will be able to automatically identify payments from that client, so that he can pay a monthly service fee without even opening your website (you will need to take a possible exchange-rate gap into account though).

From a privacy standpoint, all financial transactions will proceed to addresses that are completely invisible to outside observers. These observers will be able to tell how many clients initiated such a setup though, cause Notification Transactions to the same Payment Code are distinguishable.

As a bonus, you get an option to proceed a refund if needed so you don’t need to ask a client any additional information if a refund was initiated.

You can chat with Justus Ranvier (u/ABlockInTheChain) — the author of this technology, who is quite active on this sub. I hope he will correct me if I am wrong somewhere here.

In my opinion, this is a very important technology both in terms of privacy and usability, and ProtonMail/ProtonVPN can help in promoting it by simultaneously benefiting from it!";7;0;False;;dudfdfo;ProtonMail asking for community assistance to enable Bitcoin Cash payments;7xwlt1;https://twitter.com/ProtonMail/status/964220746317824000

"We did a Coinify integration for a 100 million user site and it's quite reliable for the amount of payments we get. They accept multiple different cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin Cash so you can just enable the ones you want. As far as reliability goes the service hasn't gone down, but users have had issues when there's congestion on the BTC network and fees go up so it can take a long time to settle their payments. That's more of a BTC network though and should be eliminated with BCH. Supporting BTC now just causes more support issues.

As far as privacy goes, users can use Tor/VPN or whatever if they really want. Anyway the integration we did didn't really compromise user privacy because we did it inside our End to End encrypted client app. So the client requests a BTC invoice from our API, our API sets that up with Coinify and passes the necessary details for payment back to the client. The client makes payment to that address directly from their wallet. The API gets notified that that invoice # has been paid. The only information Coinify knows is the From BTC address and an invoice number.

Y’all dumb af, Bitcoin Cash is better than Bitcoin. Larger Blockchain and bigger supply mined so far, better difficulty adjustment algorithms, larger block size, lowest fees, much lower wait time for a transaction to go through, and because it’s based on SHA256 just like Bitcoin adoption, wallet creation and moving over couldn’t be easier. Companies that accept bitcoin can accept bitcoin cash more easily. Y’all just a bunch of propagandists. Bitcoin has been bleeding market dominance consistently since 2013.

Buying a MacBook will save them money in the long run. The computer will last longer, it’s more durable, better hardware, more secure and faster software than windows. No need to run anti virus.
