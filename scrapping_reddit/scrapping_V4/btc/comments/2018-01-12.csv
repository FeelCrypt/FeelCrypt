"> This story suggests that the Crypto community should be doing a lot more to publish accurate fee information.

Or maybe r / bitcoin could simply end their Nazi-level censorship, and stop banning people who talk about Bitcoin BTC's high fees.

It's not complicated.  

Every morning I look at the below charts.  

Every day, I will choose the top 4-5 coins with the highest retail node support, and between them, I will choose the one with the lowest fee.   Lowest number wins.

Every day, every coin will have to lineup and compete, forever.  No excuses.

"China right now is at an imitation stage. They don't do anything particularly better than the west yet but they are catching up. They don't like to take the first step instead preferring to let the west take the lead and experiment with new tech before using it themselves. 

They are also not a democracy nor really a fully free market. Their sense of control and regulation is drastically different, which as a young system of the world's largest nation is warranted.  Imagine if they just say alright cryptos all right and legal, and 1billion Chinese suddenly all get hyped and start buying and using bitcoins instead of RMB. That would be a disaster for China. And a disaster for China will have repercussions for the region and the world.

But all that said. The Chinese have proven to be anything but dumb and inept.

 Neither have they been shown to be aggressive and warlike. Both of which the US shows plenty , particularly with Trump.

"money is short term/small thinking.   there's a bigger thing here.   Think about this -- the end of any censorship in every country on the planet.  

Think about this -- what happens when crypto gets so big, no one every cashes back out into fiat currency?   The government loses ALL control because of how the technology works.  They litterally can't ever get your ""money"".

Governments are terrified of crypto because of what it does right now yes, but what it brings to the table in the future.   

And here's the cool part - all the crypto that they want to get rid of, and control? -- it's all the new form of ""stock"" backing the new wave of tech companies dedicated to doing things like decentrailzed information sharing.

If the governments can't stop these companies money supply, then what these companies produce will grow like an unstoppable virus.

Imagine making it impossible for censorship in China or Iran to exist?  Imagine a system that can track exact origins of stories and ensure that they never ever can be manipulated.   What about photos being backed by cryptographic work so they can't be altered?

"The ripple foundation 100% controls *issuance* of the currency.  Without the corporation, coins couldn't even be generated.  There is no mining process and there is no incentive to protect or secure the network.  

The white paper shows the reality of their consensus algorithm in this paragraph...

>While we have shown that the Ripple Protocol is
provably secure so long as the bounds described in equations 1 and 3 are met, it is worth noting that these are
maximal bounds, and in practice the network may be
secure under significantly less stringent conditions.  It
is also important to recognize, however, that satisfying
these bounds is not inherent to the RPCA itself,  but
rather requires **management of the UNLs of all users.**
The default UNL provided to all users is already sufficient, but should a user make changes to the UNL, it
must be done with knowledge of the above bounds. In
addition, **some monitoring of the global network structure  is required**  in  order  to ensure  that  the bound  in
equation 3 is met, and that agreement will always be
satisfied.

Notice the part where it talks about *management of the UNLs of all users* and the part where it talks about *some monitoring of global network structure* being required...

The white paper goes in depth into the likelihood of a false consensus being achieved and shows that ripple can provably function while less than 20% of the network are bad actors.  

But 20% bad actors is nothing.  It means literally nothing when there is no incentive from mining or fees or anything else to not be a bad actor.  Since there is no proof of work or proof of stake or anything else involved, a group of bad actors who have no investment in the network what so ever could spin up a bunch of nodes for essentially no cost and corrupt the network.  

And guess who saves the network at this point... the *management.*

If Ripple labs went away, the coin would instantly die.  ";3;1;False;liquidify;dsl0wtu;An appeal to the thief that stole my cryptocurrency;7poga6;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7poga6/an_appeal_to_the_thief_that_stole_my/

"Your use of the word ""distributed"" in reference to Ripple is bullshit and is meant only to mislead people who don't understand why distribution of a ledger must happen in bitcoin and other real crypto currencies.  The purpose of distribution of a ledger in a real cryto is to secure that ledger by making it impossible to change other than through consensus.  Every time we add a block to a chain, it demands that consensus because it essentially forks the previous chain in a way that is provably following consensus rules. 

Unlike any real crypto currency, for ripple, the fact that people *can* (nobody actually does) have copies (""distributed"") of the ledger does nothing to prevent ripple from changing the ledger and has no relationship to consensus. 

Ripple's ledger is mutable only by and through Ripple, and the fact that people can have a copy has no impact on its security or the fact that it is entirely censorable and controllable 100% by Ripple.  Ripple claims that it is peer to peer, but it holds the final word on everything that enters or exits their chain, so they are full of shit, just like the use of ""distributed"" is technically true but entirely misleading concerning ripple... full of shit, just like the Ripple coin is full of shit in general.";2;1;False;liquidify;dskav46;An appeal to the thief that stole my cryptocurrency;7poga6;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7poga6/an_appeal_to_the_thief_that_stole_my/

"> The thief's intent was to steal, but did he actually commit a crime other than deceiving OP. 

Deception is fraud, which is a crime. So, providing an item that you say is brand new, but which you've already configured, and then provided a different set of instructions so that it would appear that you hadn't already set it up, that's quite a bit of intent. IT's not like it was a simple email even, IIRC, they had scratch off cards made professionally...

 There are probably a litany of other crimes as well, interstate commerce, using a computer in commission of a crime (again, fraud, theft, etc), wire fraud. Someone else mentioned mail fraud, which makes sense since it was probably delivered by the USPS. And Postal Inspectors don't take kindly to people doing that sort of stuff.

I'm not even a lawyer. 

Saying ""It might be fraud but maybe not because its cryptocurrency"" is not a valid argument. Maybe you think the laws haven't caught up, but even if you claim ""hey, i didn't steal the coins, see, they'ere still right on the block chain"" you've deprived someone else of them.

So yeah, if the scammer registered their eBay account under their real name (or one that could be attached to them) and/or accepted payment with a method that was tied to them (paypal), then they're correct to scramble to make things right...

Oh, and I believe Trezor's CEO inquired here about the listing too... So on top of OP (who might have originally appeared too small to be a threat), eBay, Paypal and the postal service (who, the scammer might have thought wouldn't take much interest in such a ""small"" scam), there's also a business whose livelihood depends on people trusting their products implicitly.

"Not at all. My point was that this scam has a start up cost associated with it. Maybe a significant one. You are saying this with retrospect. Here is how I know. 

He didn't buy it knowing that it was pre-initialized. 

He was trying to follow the first rule of crypto (which I agree with). 

How do you own your own private keys? Well, one way that everyone recommends is a Ledger. 

So he bought one *new* from ebay. It came *sealed* with printed paper cards in the exact same font as the original. He followed the instructions that came in the *sealed package*. 

I don't disagree, but how the fuck is verifying wallet signatures relevant to this particular scam? It's a real Ledger. Please gloat more about your mastery of the security curve, good sir.

He was the first (and only?) person to report falling for this particular scam. It was unknown prior. This wasn't a myetherwllet.com or send me your private keys scam.

Finally, I agree that crypto isn't for everyone. However, this isn't a situation where someone decided not to use 2FA. He tried to follow the first rule of crypto, the most secure way (hardware wallet), and was the first person to get caught by a scam with a significant start up cost.

"When you received your Ledger Nano, it prompted you to set up your password, right?  Usually it is a series of digits (maybe 4 to 8 digits).  Did you set up your password?  I assume so because in your post last week you indicated you actually used this Ledger for a while and then left it alone for a month before realising the theif stole your funds.  But in order for you to use it, you would really have needed to have a password. 

Anyway, once you set up your Ledger, you should really only need to have the device inserted in your computer and know your password to be able to send funds.  It should require you to enter your password to even open it up and see your wallets.  Since you said you saw the funds back in your ledger wallets, I assumed you had your password.  If so, you can just set up new wallets somewhere else (anywhere else) outside the control of the scammer.  Then send the funds from your compromised Ledger Nano to the new wallets you created somewhere else.

You're kidding, right? A pre initialized crypto device from eBay. All kind of alarms need go off when you see that. It breaks the first rule of crypto: if you down own the private key, it's not your money. You NEVER use predefined seeds, or seeds from websites, mails, etc. If someone generated they key for you, you already can't trust it. It's the first rule.

You also need to know how to verify the hashes and signature of wallet software. Unfortunately a lot of stuff on github completely lacks signatures, verifying ownership is impossible.

That's correct.  But we don't need to handle Visa-level traffic *today*.  It's going to be a gradual climb.  Storage and bandwidth will get cheaper in the meantime.  And if on-chain scaling starts to get unwieldy, we always have the option of deploying layer 2 solutions.

Did you notice that word ""option""?  Layer 2 isn't *mandatory* with Bitcoin Cash.  There's still more than enough room on layer 1.  And as storage costs drop and bandwidth becomes more available, layer 1 can be expanded farther without sacrificing decentralization.

"It would be an interesting footnote in Bitcoins history if companies that chose to go the route of full licensing and regulation end up going out of business due to onerous requirements ; whereas businesses which chose to skirt the license and/or operate outside of overly regulated jurisdictions boom.

That is pretty anti-fragile if you ask me. Companies can inefficiently use the blockchain all they want; overpay and congest the network.  They can only do this as long as they make enough profit to do so. The market will trend towards greater efficiency so over time businesses with inefficient methods will go out of business. If they never go out of business then it must not be all that harmful.

If L2 solutions like LN is successful each blockchain Tx will end up representing thousands; maybe hundreds of thousands of LN Tx. If each blockchain Tx ends up representing 100,000 LN Tx ; each with a fee of $0.005; then each blockchain Tx could end up being $500 or more.

"When I refer to Bitcoin being anti-fragile; I'm referring to the network itself.

The vast majority of people in this world want their money stored with trusted 3rd parties. I'm not one of those people so I will choose to run my own LN Hub or transact on the blockchain itself. 

For spending the vast majority of people will keep their coins with a 3rd party that performs LN Tx on their behalf. The general public wants reversible Tx and they want someone to sue if their funds are lost.

For those that wish to be their own bank, like myself, we will run our own LN Hub/Node and keep our savings offline/airgapped. Top up my LN wallet once or twice a year depending on fee conditions.

My motivation in getting involved with Bitcoin is to displace the central banks. If we can displace Visa all the better; but my primary goal with supporting Bitcoin is displacing central banks. For that I believe decentralization of the base layer is of utmost importance. 

If your blockchain can be taken over because it is not sufficiently decentralized then it doesn't matter if you hold private keys or not. 

If you transact on a centralized 2nd or 3rd layer with LN and the centralized parties try to play foul; the worst that happens is you have to settle to the blockchain and the attacker never wins.

"I am satisfied with the current development direction of Bitcoin. I would like fee's to be lower but I am not willing to sacrifice decentralization of the base layer for lower fee's. 

Nobody is forced to use 2nd layers; they can always choose to transact on the blockchain itself. If the blockchain itself is centralized then people truly do not have a choice. If a person is sending $100k to family overseas they'll use a blockchain transaction. If a person is paying their rent or their groceries they'll use Lightning. 

Lightning nodes may or may not become KYC/AML targets. If you believe LN nodes will be targets because they are sending packets that represent money; why do you believe that regular nodes; and particularly mining nodes (who have some say over which Tx are included) will not come under KYC/AML jurisdiction?

The fact that LN operators are incentivized with revenue means that there will likely always be nodes willing to skirt KYC/AML. Bittorrent seeders risk their property and get nothing in return; LN nodes will have revenue that can be invested in increasing security/privacy.

This is a difference of opinion regarding the best method of scaling a brand new financial technology. To write people off who you disagree with as simply cognitive dissonance is doing yourself a disservice. This is a difference in philosophy.

People using 3rd party payment processors has nothing to do with disrupting central banks. As I've mentioned my main motivation for getting involved with Bitcoin is to disrupt the Central Banks. To disrupt the bodies with the ability to control interest rates; to disrupt their ability to inflate the currency at will. That is my primary motivation from which my other opinions regarding scaling are derived. I would be perfectly happy if VISA thrived while making the FED, ECB, and IMF obsolete.

"Well, I see this from quite a different perspective. I ended up reading the white paper back in 2010 and immediately understood that this was incredibly powerful - a currency the world needed. For me Bitcoin represented an alternative to the follies of Central Banks, the start of something that could, if the cards were played right, create an alternative to the established financial system. I vested my name, resources, time and effort into Bitcoin. I created that first 3D rendering that really caught on and everybody used, even to this day. Its not that I disagree with Core, its that they have basically hijacked Bitcoin and want to take it in a _completely_ different direction. A direction that is _not_ aligned with the principles, ideals, philosophy that Bitcoin was _clearly_ meant to have. Look for example at the contents of the genesis block. Bitcoin was highly political from the very get go. If Core wanted to run their insane fantasy of forced 2nd layer scaling _they_ should have forked and left Bitcoin on the path that was intended. But they are _greedy_ on other peoples efforts and wanted to catch a free ride by taking the brand name into their possession. Now i'm in the position that i have to go around to the people i introduced Bitcoin to in the past and explain that the Bitcoin we signed up for is dying, the contents in the box called Bitcoin has been snuffed out and replaced with a poison seed. A seed that is destined to diminish the market dominance of bitcoin, a Trojan. The great alternative to central banks that had fantastic traction is fading.

If LN succeeds its going to become impossible for regular users to do on-chain transactions. Just imagine if there are millions and millions of users only using coins circulating on LN hubs. There will never be a need to have coins on a ""legacy"" wallet, just permanently on LN wallets. The aggregated transaction fees from all of the hubs compete for block space. The fees are going to moon. $32 now is going to turn into $3200 when hubs settle their balances. At bare minimum the LN should compete with on-chain transaction so that the market could decide what it wants. The market is pretty clear when it comes to Segwit, thumbs down, adoption is a disaster. The market don't want Cores vision.

Since Core used trickery and coercion to force Segwit on users, users now vote with their wallet - refusing to use Seqwit. Core needs to take a deep look in the mirror and grow up. If not Bitcoin dominance will continue to slip to single digit. Core can just praise themselves lucky Segwit was a softfork, because had it been a hardfork Bitcoin Cash would now be Bitcoin.";4;1;False;nagdude;dskxa5y;/r/bitcoin is in uproar about Coinbase not implementing Segwit -> mempool mooning is single handedly Coinbase' fault.

"To be fair I've noticed on withdrawals that they always consolidate the change address in a separate transaction. This happens even when withdrawing via GDAX.

For instance the other day I made a withdrawal and there was ~0.002 that was sent to an unused coinbase change address. Then what was really bizarre is that CB ""consolidated"" this into another address (with other inputs presumably other withdrawals were being consolidated here). But they ended up paying 0.0015 BTC in fee's on this 2nd transaction.

So to recap from my free GDAX withdrawal they paid a ~$20 Tx fee; and then they consolidated their change and paid another $20 Tx fee to recoup ~$5.

If they are going to consolidate anyways; why not just use the intended consolidation address as the change address and get it done in one Tx. They paid $40 in Tx fee's when they could get away with $5 or less. If they didn't double up their transactions and did batching once an hour their expenses would be far lower.

So it begs the question; it costs them much more than necessary to send Tx the way they do; so are they inefficient/incompetent or are they deliberately driving up fee's on BTC? Are they hamstrung by regulations and licensing?";33;2;False;45sbvad;dskhsqu;/r/bitcoin is in uproar about Coinbase not implementing Segwit -> mempool mooning is single handedly Coinbase' fault.

Segwit is complex, costly to implement and nearly no reward for doing so.  Do not blame companies for Developers garbage solutions.  Do not blame users for a broken system.  If you want companies to follow along, give them a simple solution, easy to implement, with great reward.  Give them a blocksize increase. This was all obvious years ago and those that are still blind to it, I feel, are doing so for malicious reasons.
