"https://ibb.co/kGtyfd  <- This is the mail they sent.

I just (stupidly) put in 3k hoping to get TRX last week with these guys. Now I have a sinking feeling, especially having just checked my email. They sent me a mail saying that they've ""closed [my] account due to inactivity"". I can't see any currency when logging in. The rep said on the email that I provided the wrong type of ticket number. I just provided the one they gave me. But I think I send them the wrong number and now I found it. They said that ""Jose"" is not one of their staff. That is who I talked to on the phone. Now that number is no longer connecting. If I got a fake number from them, they are on the hook for that I believe.

My actual (but closed) ticket number is 741464

I'm sending a PM to the OP and will attempt to get my money. If I had a crystal ball I would not use these guys.

Of course, but fractional reserves aren’t inherently bad. There is a federally mandated limit to fractional reserving that actually shouldn’t exist in a free market. That ratio is based on risk and people are free to deposit at bank that fractionally reserve 10:1 or even 100:1, and the higher that reserve ratio the greater return you get for keeping your savings there, but the more risk you carry as well. ;2;1;False;BECAUSEYOUDBEINJAIL;dyq612t;1 For whoever questions the utility of Bitcoin, here's banking summarized accurately;8i6ugd;https://i.redd.it/xa71uovqkuw01.jpg

"“Agreed to” can be argued. I remember when my bank called me and told me about opting out of overdraft. I made it very clear I wanted things declined, not to overdraft. I distinctly remembered it because it’s not very often that I get aggravated on the phone (everyone is just doing their job). This kid just would not take no for an answer so I ripped into him a little. Fast forward to almost a year later. I get hit with tons of overdrafts, as I expected things to be declined, so I called the bank. Ended up moving up the food chain to some sort of management which tells me that the calls were recorded. I laughed because I remember the call. He called back awhile later and was like “oh yeah, you definitely declined”. All fees dropped.

In essence your money can be put to work by lending it to others or acquiring stakes in productive ventures.

If you give it to the bank they get to exercise that option and generally do pay you little or interest.

Locking your money in to get zero fees is traded for the value of committing that money to a venture which has a real monetary value.

Further inflation is a very real aspect of the wider global economy; the spending power of your idle money decreases everyday and noticeably every year. Your money is actually shrinking in the bank while you marvel at your zero fees.

Bitcoin via cash fork  or lightening network offers near zero fees for transactions and a store of value that is far milder in inflation and in fact presently hyper deflationary year on year.
