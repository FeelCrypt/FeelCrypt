Satoshi obviously would have done this, being a coder, not a showboat.

The fact that Craig did not do this, means that he should be ignored.

He (Craig) never states anywhere that his blog post is proof that he is Satoshi. All the contacted media sources, Jon and Gavin, all state they were provided information (privately) and not one source refers to his blog post (as the information or otherwise).

If you mean that I overly think bigger blocks are the way forward, then yes, I've felt that way since it was first brought up in 2013. I actually thought it was a non-issue even before that.

Because I can recognize a simple fact?  I don't claim he is Satoshi, I'm merely pointing out that just because some people don't like how this is proceeding doesn't mean he's not Satoshi.  It's pretty basic reasoning.  More people should try it.;2;1;False;Vibr8gKiwi;d2qfn7e;"Why I declined to ""verify"" SN's identity two weeks ago";4hj20k;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4hj20k/why_i_declined_to_verify_sns_identity_two_weeks/
"I'm perfectly prepared to accept that Satoshi is an awkward, arrogant dick; the open source movement, and Bitcoin in particular, are replete with them. 

What gets me is that Craig doesn't seem to be honest or intelligent. The only explanation for a clever, honest man handling this event the way he has is that it's some elaborate plot in which we are not participants. Otherwise, he is not smart, or he's not honest, or both - and however little we know about Satoshi, he was certainly smart.

Fine. I'll prepare the draconian NDAs.

"Would Satoshi Nakamoto prove his identity by quietly, awkwardly and non-publicly verifying his identity to a handful of people?

Or would Satoshi Nakamoto, the inventor of Bitcoin, go down the public verification route?

The answer is obvious to me, I'd be surprised/shocked and crushed if this secretive and awkward man is Satoshi Nakamoto.";3;3;False;Chistown;d2qrqos;"Why I declined to ""verify"" SN's identity two weeks ago";4hj20k;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4hj20k/why_i_declined_to_verify_sns_identity_two_weeks/

"Satoshi was never a public person, his vigilance to remain anonymous for so long is proof of that so it may be he's not comfortable with going down the public verification route, but I still no justifiable reason to NOT go down the public route, until he explains himself I guess we sit here twiddling our fingers. I also must say that 5 years can change a person, I know for a fact I have changed drastically over the last 5 years. Satoshi also kept things very professional and was socially distant much of the time, comparing his online persona to his public one is not much of an indicator IMO.

One thing is for sure though, not supplying public proof he created the genesis block is hurting his public image a massive amount, and if he is SN, he's also hurting Gavin's reputation after he publicly fingered him as SN. CSW needs to smarten up and stop jerking people around if he wants to prove he is SN.";2;0;False;ferretinjapan;d2qz22r;"Why I declined to ""verify"" SN's identity two weeks ago";4hj20k;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4hj20k/why_i_declined_to_verify_sns_identity_two_weeks/
