"It's a bit hard for me to fathom banks making loans in Bitcoin. I know your premise is ""bitcoin WILL stabilize one day"", but bankers won't have the huge benefits they currently get from fractional reserve banking. Being able to take the same monies and loan it many times over will no longer be possible since the coins are unique. They can loan your coins but they can do it only once. It is effectively loaning one asset for another, where the assets only differ in their liquidity.

The rates would be quite steep because they have to split the return with you. Any upward shift in coin valuation will destroy their interest return.";1;1;False;bitmeister;ecqq90h;So true this is.............. Have a good day everyone :);aa7b4l;https://i.redd.it/vy0rp1n2ey621.png
">	Just one example “need” that banks could fulfill is simple custody of crypto like they hold peoples cash. Most people’s security sucks, and holding an asset who’s properties include irreversibility of transactions is extremely risky for the mainstream.

This opens the door to your Bitcoin being seized.

Another function they can provide is the “putting your money to work for you” one. Like it or not, the price of bitcoin WILL stabilize one day. And people don’t want to lock up their cash or anything else in an asset that does nothing. Some might want to take on a small amount of risk to earn interest on their deposits, without having a huge amount of single counterparty risk. Banks can spread their crypto their portfolios of thousands to millions of loans and have the infrastructure and expertise in place to mange crypto based loans as well.

This opens the door for the banks to lose your Bitcoin

The banks work with the government to control the flow of money to prevent illegal activity. Decentralized currencies allow money to be sent to anywhere in the world without control. To use an example, there are some countries that have sanctions imposed on them and participating governments have an obligation to prevent the flow of money to these countries. The lack of control will be something that governments will want to be change before the integration of a crypto currency will take place. For this reason centralized crypto currencies will be integrated whereas Bitcoin will always exist outside government control, hence, wont be fully integrated into a countries banking system.";1;0;False;Oreotech;ecqv1li;So true this is..............

"The big banks could care less about crypto regulation. Their efforts have been focused on Dodd-Frank rollbacks because that impacts their bottom-lines astronomically compared to any crypto-friendly regulation. They have no interest in fighting change with crypto regulation, and there have been no federal changes to regulations that apply to digital assets, aside from FinCEN interpretive guidance in 2013 and a notice from the IRS in 2014.

All of the big banks are qualified custodians and do provide custodial services. Are you referring to acting as an exchange or an alternative trading system?
