"Coke is owned by a central authority that decides what Coke is. Bitcoin has no central authority, only competing implementations. If one of those implementations decides to make a radical change while the original continues to still exist, it follows that the radically changed version should choose a new name.

Since there are two implementations currently competing for the same hashpower, there should be a way to differentiate them by name.  Bitcoin Cash is the name of the one that resembles the original vision, and Bitcoin Core is what the radically changed one is being called since it’s community hasn’t chosen a name on their own. When the competition is resolved, the winner can simply be called bitcoin and go on its way. Until that time, it is reasonable that people refer to them by names which differentiate the type of bitcoin they are referring to.

"Many of us disagree with your premise. The majority of the hashrate and market cap and txs are easy to measure mathematically. However measuring the amount of development and majority of people who ""spoke"" is not. I agree with btc people that saying bch is ""the real bitcoin"" is silly. On the flip side however trying to say that bch is not also bitcoin is silly. Bitcoin is not 1 thing anymore. That is hard for some people to accept. All of the forks of bitcoin including bitcoin pizza and bitcoin gold are bitcoin. Whether or not you think they are legitimate projects or scams however is opinion. I personally think BCH is the best implementation of what Satoshi originally envisioned. Which is why I choose to support it. But I do not deny that BTC is also the core devs team's opinion of the best progression of the bitcoin project. I can not speak for everyone, but I think the majority of people I know personally would be satisfied if people on the BTC side quit trying to deny that BCH is also bitcoin and lay off the ""bcash btrash chinese scam coin rhetoric!"".

"**Isotopes of gold**

Gold (79Au) has one stable isotope, 197Au, and 18 radioisotopes, with 195Au being the most stable with a half-life of 186 days. Gold is currently considered the heaviest monoisotopic element (bismuth formerly held that distinction, but bismuth-209 has been found to be slightly radioactive).

"There is no confusion, the name is bitcoin cash and the official website is bitcoincash.org.

I refer to both as BCH and BTC often, personally I think this whole discussion is misplaced because I never saw anyone marketing BCH as BTC. Calling BCH ""bitcoin"" is not wrong at all, because it is bitcoin, same for BTC.

I find helpful to distinguish ""bitcoin cash"" from ""bitcoin core"" (a core's project, ""bitcoin core"" ipso facto).

"Bitcoin Cash respresents a return to the original Bitcoin design, as it ran for 8 years, and it uses the historical Bitcoin ledger (no investors were disenfranchised, sound money was preserved).

That said, keeping in mind that every new 10x surge in adoption and price comes almost entirely from NEW users, businesses and investors, there is probably a system bias among us oldtimers toward overestimating how important the name is.

"Totally agree with you. 

One issue is the “Bitcoin Cash = Bitcoin” crowd seems to not have a strict definition of what “Bitcoin” is. Before, it was [Gavin’s definition](http://gavinandresen.ninja/a-definition-of-bitcoin) which basically says “the longest chain wins”. For a while that’s what Bitcoin XT etc was going for. After that since BCH is clearly not the longest chain there’s an evolved definition about the “original” protocol but that is a loose concept too as a lot of the transaction types we use these days came from forks after the original white paper. It’s hard to argue what a name means when there is no concise definition of said term.

Also, Bitcoin Cash came from a lack of consensus especially from miners. The fork initially clearly branded itself as “Bitcoin Cash”, even though it puts itself as closer to the original vision. This rebranding itself as “Bitcoin” un-ironically is actually making the coin lose credibility and reputation among the greater crypto crowd. It also adds unnecessary confusion in regular discussions. E.g. Ethereum Classic doesn’t say it is “Ethereum” without extra qualifications. Like it or not, it was Bitcoin Cash’s decision to fork and given it is still a minority hash chain I can’t really say “Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin” with a straight face. I will say it’s my preferred protocol that fulfills what Bitcoin’s vision more though.

"> changes to the protocol called Lightning Network...

This is something that gets repeated a lot but there are no changes to Bitcoin to work with Lightning network. This is FUD. The only change to Bitcoin has been the addition of SegWit which is still compatible with older constraints on blocks. That's not to say that SegWit wasn't a change, it was, but in a clever way that makes SegWit blocks look like and validate as older blocks did.

The fact of the matter is that there is absolutely zero code related to the Lightning network added to Bitcoin. Lightning doesn't depend on a specific cryptocurrency and it works just as well with Litecoin for instance. The only reason why SegWit is often described as required for Lightning Network is because SegWit also fixed transaction malleability. LN is still totally possible even without fixing transaction malleability, the problem is that an attacker can screw with your transactions in such a way as to lock up your funds until your channel expires and sends the coins back to you. Even without totally fixing transaction malleability Bitcoin Cash could still use Lightning network to transfer coins offchain.";1;1;False;MertsA;dyipyh6;"Am I the only one that doesn't mind Bitcoin Cash being called ""Bitcoin Cash"" instead of just ""Bitcoin"" (for now)?";8h7l37;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8h7l37/am_i_the_only_one_that_doesnt_mind_bitcoin_cash/
"You may be the first to point out that 'this whole fucking stupid problem [could] happen again someday"" over the bitcoin (BCH) name - though not sure if you meant 'Bitcoin' or 'Bitcoin Cash'.

Point taken though.

The idea of ""rights to the name"" for open-source anonymously authored (code?) whose specifictions are an academically cited whitepaper. Don't suppose SN ever thought he had reason to be concerned about it. Maybe this really ought to go to trial to establish case law - someone has to arbitrate these things  - but jurisdiction is going to have to be argued to start with.

Also, it's going to attract a host of interested parties wanting to define exactly what is being contested here, not just who owns the name 'bitcoin', Is there a 'chain of custody' or 'provenance' for claiming to be the 'true' Bitcoin. Seems that it's a case of a 'Recipe' vs a 'Dish'.

I prefer BCH, but find it incredibly childish and an absolute dickhead move by Ver to try and take over the Bitcoin name. We should embrace and market our differences instead of trying to trick newcomers into thinking we are core. Additionally, to just making us all not seem like total assholes, it would quell 99.9% of opposition to BCH. People don't hate us because we have bigger blocks, faster and cheaper transactions, they hate us because the way we have gone about antagonizing the market. ;7;1;False;CryptoBogan;dyicvmi;"Am I the only one that doesn't mind Bitcoin Cash being called ""Bitcoin Cash"" instead of just ""Bitcoin"" (for now)?";8h7l37;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8h7l37/am_i_the_only_one_that_doesnt_mind_bitcoin_cash/

"I would agree that on chain scaling is only viable up to a certain point. The more costly it is to run a node the less incentivized people are to run one.
