In addition to certain immutable properties, what gives BitCoin its value is that its a medium of exchange that  has many advantages over existing options.

LTC - simply creates x4 as many blocks.

"A fork with 30% miner support and right to 4MB blocks would have a higher txn per second throughput than the 70% that stayed at 1MB.

Maths for the layz:  remaining mining power * current tx/sec * blocksize in MB = 0.7 * 4 * 1 = 2.8 tx/sec = new tx/sec. Meaning the small block backlog would grow and grow. 

New mining power * current tx/sec * block size in MB = 0.3 * 4 * 4 = 4.8 tx/sec 

4.8 tx/sec >> 2.8 tx/sec

The situation just gets better when difficulty adjusts or when mining power moves. But the 1MB is capped at 4 tx/sec while the 4MB blocks could reach 16 tx/sec

And 4.8 tx/sec is better than the 4 we had before the fork with only 30% of the hash power

A lightweight/listening node does only need to download one block every 10 min, and thin/compact blocks helps aleviate any concerns over delay in getting the header data.

If a node intends to be fully functional (ie: uploading 5-10 the blocksize every 10min), then yes it limits how many can be productive uploaders. But that's the same for p2p file torrenting - often a small handful of seeds with extreme upload speeds (10MBps or greater) are responsible for hundreds of leeches who have little or no upload bandwidth. *last I checked the torrent system is working beautifully nonetheless, with massive files.

"That's fair, and I don't disagree.

segwit is just as much much bandwidth burden as a blocksize increase, as the signature data still needs to be shared.

As for losing some nodes that can't support uploading bigger blocks, it's inevitable afaik, but a reasonable increase like 4mb (via segwit or hf) could still be handled today, and bandwidth improves worldwide every day so we could just as easily manage 8mb by 2025, maybe even 16mb.

There will always be a minority of nodes that have the bandwidth to support the vaster majority. Imo it would take 8mb+ blocksize today to actually damage the networks ability to propogate in a reasonable timeframe.

As much as it would be ideal that everyone is a full node with ample upload ratios, that's not the case and never will be.

I want to protect bitcoin decentralization.  And for that to be protected, we need a robust distributed network of useful full nodes (one who allow many incoming connections).
