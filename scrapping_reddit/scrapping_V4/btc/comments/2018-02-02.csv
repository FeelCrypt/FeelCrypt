"In practice virtually all of the innovation on top of Ethereum is in the form of non-ETH ICO tokens (competing stores of value).

Given this, there's no use in lamenting the fact BTC can't itself be autonomously escrowed in an event driven way by Counterparty.io, since none of the ICOs built on Ethereum are dependent on receiving ETH for payments: the common business model is you have to acquire the ICO to use the promised/hyped ICO products/services.

The reason Ethereum has so much potential is the ICOs are built on top of ETH, and you must pay fees to Ethereum miners, thus reinforcing the Ethereum ecosystem to the exclusion of the Bitcoin ecosystem.

But a [nulldata version of Ethereum](https://counterparty.io/news/counterparty-recreates-ethereums-smart-contract-platform-on-bitcoin/) built on top of Bitcoin would similarly have this effect on fundamental demand for BTC.

In addition, with a nulldata version of Ethereum built on top of Bitcoin, you could raise BTC directly in an ICO and then investors could store the resulting tokens in industry standard BIP39 Bitcoin wallets, which are [much](https://blog.zeppelin.solutions/on-the-parity-wallet-multisig-hack-405a8c12e8f7), [*much*](https://paritytech.io/security-alert-2/) more foolproof than rolling your own multisig from scratch with a Turing complete smart contract system.

">The contract was built and had clear intentions of how it was to be executed.

The code is the contract. It was explicitly stated that, in case of conflict between code and description, the code is supreme.

>Hackers went around that and hacked it.

No. The code and network were not compromised. The cause was shitty code. Not hackers.

>I understand that some people believe that that means it should have been allowed, but until humans are absolutely perfect we're gonna have issues like that come up. That's why the judicial system has a focus on intent included in cases. In the case of Ethereum we were able to come together and realize the intent was not for someone to hack the contract and (for all intents and purposes) ""steal"" a sum of ethers held in there. It was the whole community that did this not just Vitalik. Enough agreed that it should be reversed.

These moral arguments are bankrupt from any sort of ethical perspective. You argue that the hard fork was righting a wrong - but that's not why it was forked. It was forked because a large percentage of the miners had economic incentives to fork.

There have been plenty of other contracts where ether has been lost because of shitty code. Gas gets trapped, amounts get stuck forever, etc. The code is clearly not functioning as intended. But because these people don't have 51% mining support, their problems don't get fixed.

It's also really stupid to set this precedent because, in a network of sufficient size, 51% of the miners should not be a party to the same contract. If the ethereum network were larger at the time of the DAO, and there wasn't a majority of miners involved in it, then the DAO wouldn't have forked and everyone would have been SOL.

">You can still use Ethereum classic then, and bag hold that to the grave.

Networks need people, obviously. It's no good being the only one using Ethereum classic, based on its founding principles. That's why I urge ethereum users to consider those founding principles of ethereum and not violate them.

>Recovering from the DAO hack was important and it showed enterprises for the first time you can effectively ""control + z"" an entire hack. 

No, it didn't. It showed you could ""control z"" ethereum if 51% of the miners are economically incentivized to do it.

There are plenty of other people who have lost ether/gas because of bad code. They don't get a ""control z"". And as the network grows, the likelihood that 51% of miners will be involved in the same contract decreases. Thus, we shouldn't expect this to ever happen again.

"And there were pretty large concerns, including that someone with demonstrated malicious intent being in control of such a large amount of ETH could lead to future attacks on the network, especially when proof of stake got implemented.

I'd be pretty surprised if in an alternate reality where Satoshi came back and started using his enormous amounts of BTC to attack the network people just decided to ""well it's okay, code is law, we'll just say goodbye to bitcoin I guess"", after with his enormous stash he stopped the network for months and months on end.

It'd obviously be a ""waste"" of money but if the attacker was having all the addresses constantly blacklisted by exchanges it would just make ""alternative methods"" to get the money out, in this case by shorting, even more viable and likely. Didn't the DAO hacker launch multiple attacks against the Ethereum Classic network, to the point of miners running blacklists? And if the argument is that code is law, then it just brings into question why are widespread blacklists used by miners ""ok"" (which are in a way 51% attacks against the miners that do accept those transactions, to censor valid transactions) but the community agreeing to reverse the hack (by using a version without them) ""not ok"".

"He is one of the Bitcoin Dictators, believing he owns Bitcoin itself and dictates it's future. When you don't agree with that he will ban you from /r/bitcoin and from https://bitcointalk.org/

He has many alt accounts, but his reign is about to end. He quit blockstream because he does not want to be on the loosing side. He is probably trying to get power in the Bitcoin Cash community using one of his alt accounts. Cobracoin might just be him. As a human being he is okay with lying and deceiving and he has done a lot of damage in the Bitcoin community. Partly because of him it all splintered and we have like 1000+ altcoins now. Together with his blockstream peers he is mainly responsible for that. They tried to grab power but Satoshi said: ""Lol what?""

In fact Satoshi said ""Lol what?"" 2 years before he even heard about Bitcoin. I think my bitcointalk account is only 3 or 4 months younger then his. 

Anyway, we all would like to forget he ever existed. Hopefully within the next couple of years we will collectively be able to forget about him. 

He does not understand what it means to have a truly decentralized system where nobody can grab power unless they secure enough hashpower to kill the system. I think you need like 70 - 85% hash power for that. 51% only allows you to have a bit of a chance to double spend. This does not kill the system. Satoshi build a system that is protected by the greed and the drive for profit. /u/nullc and his peers totally missed out on the good kind of profit so they tried to hijack the whole thing and they failed because they never truly understood the Satoshi idea. And even when people do understand it. Some actually secretly hate it. 

Just remember that no matter what /u/nullc says: it is known by a good chunk of the bitcoin community that this person is a liar and has no integrity or honesty or honor for that matter. I have seen this with my own eyes. Best we forget about him and move forward.

Meta protocols store the whole command there, and right now even 80 bytes are not enough. Both Omni and Counterparty currently only have sends with one recipient, which results in a massive number of transactions due to withdrawals from exchanges, because they can't be bundled. We also want to move the recipient into the payload to avoid UTXO bloat due to not-dust-but-uneconomic-outputs, which are currently used to tag recipients. And we also want to add multi-sends to allow bundling of withdrawals and payments in general, but this needs a lot more payload space.

"> Long after that op_return discussion vitalik was going around with adam back trying to get money for a bitcoin venture, ethereum came after that.

I'm aware of this. I know that Vitalik had spoken to Adam while attempting to raise moneys early on for various projects. And you're timeline is correct. I think that the intentions of the ETH team, given the hidden history, has always been nefarious. After all, just months before releasing the ETH paper, Vitalik was pitching quantum mining machines and asking for money to develop them.

As to why no one has evidence of it, I'm not sure. But either this is a mass delusion, or there is merit to that claim. Whether 40 bytes isn't enough, I think, is irrespective of the point. We know that 40 bytes is fine. The problem with the ETH team is the incompetence that would have failed to figure out how to use the Bitcoin blockchain.

I wouldn't necessarily evoke Rootstock as the grand poobah of 40 byte-stuffing genius though. The EVM is idiotic. And I think there is still a large question as to what distinguishes any of these smart contracts from a timelock enhanced multi-sig transaction. Rootstock is no better than ETH in that sense. Moreover, Rootstock is being developed in a time of sidechains. ETH was too early to have incorporated the sidechain pump into their scam.

> And if it was ""proposed"" as claimed, where is the proposal? Even a gmail DKIM timestamped private email? Nothing seem to be forthcoming. It just looks like a false memory which conveniently (for some) slanders Bitcoin and excuses otherwise transparently greedy and sleazy behaviour.

Again, apart from memory, I'm not going to push the claim. I have nothing more than circumstantial evidence. And I doubt in mass delusion. I would swear that at the very least, both Vitalik and the Counterparty team claimed to have fought the fight. That said, having not been a part of the fight myself, all I have are their early claims, which may be where OP got the idea that the fight happened. Perhaps he heard it there. Given the number of people who have told me the fight occurred, I have been inclined to believe it.

"> never saw email from vbuterin. nor in the relevant pull-request.

That is the strawman. vbuterin didn't have to interact directly with the developers because OP_RETURN was a public discussion after all. No one claimed that the developers directly addressed vbuterin or that vbuterin directly addressed the developers. That is completely beside the fact that this public discussion caused him to develop ethereum on top of primecoin and then later with its own base layer.

Notice that nullc himself said that it wouldn't have made sense for vbuterin to write an email at that time. So why insist on showing a email that wouldn't have made sense at the time? Because there isn't one and that is a easy strawman argument to win. It is however absolutely useless to the discussion. 

Nullc also brought up premine allegations just out of the blue, called ethereum a scam and called vbuterin a liar. Is that a contribution to the discussion? Is that on topic?

That is only one interpretation of his statistical points.

Yup.  They were spamming the crap out of IRC trying to get investors and ended up getting banned from a bunch of channels.

> Whether 40 bytes isn't enough, I think, is irrespective of the point. We know that 40 bytes is fine. The problem with the ETH team is the incompetence that would have failed to figure out how to use the Bitcoin blockchain.

Fair enough.

> I wouldn't necessarily evoke Rootstock as the grand poobah of 40 byte-stuffing genius though. The EVM is idiotic.

Full agreement, I wasn't holding it out as a good idea. Just pointing out that there wasn't anything blocking whatever eth people wanted to do in Bitcoin that required the route they took. It would have been hopelessly foolish any way it went-- I just think it's unfortunate to see eth's issuers attempt to use Bitcoin as a justification for their actions without it being contested. :)

> told me the fight occurred

Fight? no way; perhaps someone was thinking about it and not making it clear-- always possible.  Certainly in the Bitcoin project we never saw anything like someone saying ""we want to make a smart contract uberscam, and need more bytes here because bar!"" (if we had, we would have at least told them why they didn't need more bytes!). But as you say-- it was nefarious from the start, who knows what crazy justifications they were circulating among themselves and their earliest investors.

"> proposed building ETH on Bitcoin. That was an early claim, and was made during the time that the size of OP_Return was being debated. Regarding the evidence, I'm not sure I have it other than as a memory.

Long after that op_return discussion vitalik was going around with adam back trying to get money for a bitcoin venture, ethereum came after that. So I think your memory is obviously incorrect. Perhaps you recall ""op_return"" being discussed later, long after then?  In any case, it's also the simplest explanation as to why no one has any evidence of it.  It also just doesn't make sense:  what's the technical argument for anything that could be done with 80 bytes that couldn't be done with 40? Rootstock doesn't have any issue with any of this, blockstreams elements stuff doesn't have any issue with any of this, etc.

And if it was ""proposed"" as claimed, where is the proposal?  Even a gmail DKIM timestamped private email?  Nothing seem to be forthcoming.   It just looks like a false memory which conveniently (for some) slanders Bitcoin and excuses otherwise transparently greedy and sleazy behaviour.

"Perhaps if Counterparty had done an ICO and completely sold out to unprincipled speculators, we would've been better off due to having the ability to hire a bunch of developers and a full-time team of aggressive marketers to hype it. But then the Counterparty system as it's known today wouldn't exist or be interesting. Paradoxically this (lack of fundraising) also led to the system's effective demise.

> Ethereum is a giant problem

1. In Vitalik's own words, his original plan was to launch Ethereum as a metacoin on top of Primecoin entirely due to the usual suspects being aggressively anti-metacoin. So it definitely can be done if the demand exists for it, which [arguably](https://coinmarketcap.com) it does.

"> No, it was not 80. There was a proposal that went from 0 to 80 at one point but was changed to 40 before it went out because of concerns about unaddressed dos attacks and abuse, people have incorrectly claimed that some behaviour in the network was restricted or reduced, but that simply isn't the case.

Considering you *yourself* were the primary source of the so called ""concerns"" there, let it be known this is an utterly transparent reframe.

"> Would? you and your scammer buddies built that in XCP and ... it's a total bust. No one wants it. And no one stopped you from doing it, as stupid and scammy as it is.

Counterparty.io never raised a dime in funding, and Adam Krellenstein was bought out by Symbiont before he could prepare the Ethereum port for mainnet launch, sad to say. This is the problem with projects which lack a self-funding mechanism: private interests step in and often derail the system. This is an oft cited reason for the existence of the Blockstream company, and I've directly attributed Blockstream's actions wrt Counterparty to the [rise of ETH to 90% of Bitcoin's market cap](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/6wxueo/your_best_pitch_for_decred/dmcer4d/).

In practice, we are now having to turn to creative sources of funding; but *do* let us know if we should reach out to the Blockstream company for a stipend.

And I don't agree with the approach of having a bespoke VM, Ethereum-style. Whatever happened to hard coding pluggable features + the pull request button on GitHub? You can just build a Counterparty-like system using a decent programming language and then keep extending the core of the system through Decred-style HF voting.

"You don't know your history. Krellenstein didn't get bought out before the EVM was released. The EVM was developed while he was with CP and after he was gone. It was decidedly ill-advised and abandoned. u/nullc, however, is mistaken with regard to Vitalik's claim that he proposed building ETH on Bitcoin. That was an early claim, and was made during the time that the size of OP_Return was being debated. Regarding the evidence, I'm not sure I have it other than as a memory.

As to whether Ethereum would have been advisable to build on top of Bitcoin is another story. Ethereum is a giant problem, and I worry about even the viability of second layer protocols like Counterparty considering they mess with the economics of the blockchain. I can't imagine what a disaster the EVM would have been had it been released.

"> the other sub has strict rules about altcoin discussions

They banned me because I said something the mods don't like. They didn't provide a reason and upon asking for a reason they muted me from the modmail for 72h. This ban was made only minutes after BashCo replied to one of my comments he disagreed with. First with a (automod-) ShadowBan and then with a complete ban.

They don't give a shit about the rules. You disagree, you are gone.

This isn't about ""altcoins"" or whatever. They allow altcoin discussion every day as long as it is in the form of ""btrash btrash roger ver scam"" and when someone replies to the threads and comments bashing bch with something positive then they are gone. Not to mention that IF something happens to evade the censorship somehow then it will be downvoted there even worse then here. 

Comparing that to the situation here is ridiculous. Yes, you might get some downvotes if you say something stupid or off topic, but that is from the community and it does not prevent anyone from reading it either. Also since voting is done by the community you can also upvote stuff if you think that this is a comment that contributes to the discussion.

A Community down voting things that do not contribute to the discussion is not censorship.

A Moderator deleting comments/posts and banning people because he does not like what they say even though it was on topic is absolutely censorship.

"What's especially frustrating is many of /u/nullc's criticisms ring true: Ethereum *was* heavily premined, and the aggressive sales tactics employed by the Ethereum founders were *definitely* highly suspect, and have remained so to this very day.

It's just it didn't have to end with Ethereum hitting 90% of BTC's market cap. Those of us who have been in Counterparty since the early days tried EVERYTHING to convince the Bitcoin Core developers of the dire necessity of implementing smart contract features on Bitcoin mainnet, but we were ignored and belittled for our beliefs. I've [documented](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/6wxueo/your_best_pitch_for_decred/dmcer4d/) this unflattering history of the Bitcoin system elsewhere.

Metacoin systems can trivially [implement the Ethereum VM in full on top of Bitcoin](https://counterparty.io/news/counterparty-recreates-ethereums-smart-contract-platform-on-bitcoin/), if this is even desireable, which is still arguable IMO.

Combine the above with something like [Aviv Zohar's SPECTRE](https://medium.com/@avivzohar/the-spectre-protocol-7dbbebb707b5) for 10s block times and Bitcoin could quickly reach feature parity with Ethereum.

If Counterparty and Blockstream's roles were reversed in 2014, and we could've steered the Bitcoin ship, Bitcoin would've implemented Ethereum on mainnet before Ethereum itself was even able to *launch*. A move which would've likely spared Bitcoin from incalculable brand damage and brain drain.

Greg Maxwell and the usual suspects of Bitcoin-land are [directly to blame](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/6wxueo/your_best_pitch_for_decred/dmcer4d/) for Bitcoin dropping the ball on smart contracts. They're now busy backpedaling desperately and implementing their own Simplicity VM *four years too late*. And might I add: it's mildly amazing to consider the sheer *mental gymnastics* required for the usual suspects to justify implementing Simplicity on Bitcoin mainnet given the YEARS they spent lambasting Counterparty over ""blockchain bloat"".";156;13;False;insette;dtlmftk;Vitalik Buterin tried to develop Ethereum on top of Bitcoin, but was stalled because the developers made it hard to build on top of Bitcoin.

Yes. I read your previous post on this, and you nailed it. I was working on colored coin systems at the time, and Bitcoin core was frankly malicious in it's commentary and made every effort to control, limit, and otherwise destroy every possible system built on top of Bitcoin.

But Ethereum is not necessarily trying to be currency like Bitcoin Cash is. So why is it a scam? It will need a very long time to mature, maybe 20+ years or longer. But I see real usage and utility for Ethereum. Maybe smart contracts will be build on top of Bitcoin Cash one day. But is it not good to have a couple of separate systems and networks? Not 1000+ copy cat crypto's but a couple of separate blockchain type networks, I think that is good. I mean maybe Ethereum has nothing to offer long term but the same can be said about Bitcoin Cash. We will just have to wait and see. 10 years is way to short to be able to look at crypto from a distance and give it a fair judgment. ;6;1;False;Kain_niaK;dtlqxns;Vitalik Buterin tried to develop Ethereum on top of Bitcoin, but was stalled because the developers made it hard to build on top of Bitcoin.

Brand damage?  BCH worried about brand damage?  The whole loss of confidence compounded when all the FUD started that BCH might be the new bitcoin.  People saw 2 btc's on coinbase and one already having over 3k value so naturally they question what the heck makes any of them special if they can so easily be copied.  When a coin is branded and pushed for offering something unique it's one thing, but to try and denounce the coin at the top with near 20k in value at the time, did you not consider the loss of confidence and questioning of crypto in general that would create?  When a coin can go up so high and then be considered the fake by news media and where ever else you pushed your agenda?  Enjoy your just reward BCH.

"In 2012-2013 I and Vitalik built a decentralized exchange on top of Bitcoin. We built an initial prototype in matter of month.

Getting it to production quality turned to be difficult because of hostility from the protocol level. First of all, Gavin Andresen introduced dust threshold which made simple and elegant protocol impossible. 

Then we faced some form of hostility from Bitcoin developers (including you, IIRC) so it became apparent that basing a decentralized exchange on Bitcoin is a risky bet as it won't be officially supported in any way, and in fact a protocol might be broken at any time.

So Vitalik definitely ""attempted any such thing"". Of course, colored coins isn't Ethereum, but currently Ethereum is used mostly as a decentralized exchange, so functionally it's the same.

He also tried implemeting a smart contract later for Mastercoin which is quite close to Ethereum. So while there was no project called Ethereum, he made attempts to extend Bitcoin to implement decentralized exchange and smart contracts.";2;1;False;killerstorm;dtnd11w;Vitalik Buterin tried to develop Ethereum on top of Bitcoin, but was stalled because the developers made it hard to build on top of Bitcoin.

"> Core developers (Greg was one of the most vocals, I remember) were making it clear they would try to prevent any use of the block chain that deviated away from pure monetary transaction. They were trying to forbid people to use Bitcoin's block chain to store data, something essential to Ethereum.

Given the ability to hedge and invest in companies is a natural, evolutionary step on the way of any economic system becoming sufficiently advanced, I've always found it extremely perplexing how the Bitcoin Core developers were able to get away with labeling things like stock, options and futures trading as ""non-monetary"" use cases.

IMO they really were just Gentoo-loving C++ programmers who were trying to keep their full nodes runnable on home desktop computers using backwater internet connections.

"> Link to even one mailing list post you made advocating this. ... no such thing exists, because XCP has always been about pumping an altcoin in order to rip off and exploit the gullible.

You're cherry-picking, having been intimately involved in the discussions around metacoins on public forums like Reddit and Bitcointalk since 2014.

You were the primary source of fallacious accusations of ""DoS vectors"" opened up by OP_RETURN, and your (former) company, *Blockstream*, had a direct stake in competing against our approach.

Counterparty-like systems are Bitcoin's only actionable defense against Ethereum, and have been since 2014, pre-dating Ethereum itself. You're the one who is blind for honing in on the existence of XCP: what's one more token amongst thousands of ICOs, when it's the ICOs which are stealing Bitcoin's thunder, practically none of which integrate ETH payments? Can't you see Ethereum is valuable because of what is built ON TOP of it?

With the help of [Counterparty](https://counterparty.io/news/counterparty-recreates-ethereums-smart-contract-platform-on-bitcoin/), Bitcoin had the *market lead* on ICO tech, per se.

"I disagree about Buterin's integrity. He supported the DAO hard fork. 

The DAO hard fork directly contradicted the purpose and principles of ethereum. They forked ethereum, when ethereum worked as intended, for the benefit of one party to a smart contract.

From ethereum's webpage:

>Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third-party interference.

Hard forking the DAO was clearly third party interference in a private contract. The network forked on behalf of some parties to that contract. Bitcoin forks for the benefit of the network. 

Further, the terms of the DAO explicitly stated that the code was the Supreme contract, **not** any written explanations. In the event of a conflict between written representations and the code, the code is supreme. Guess not.

3-10 Sat fee transactions are confirming on Bitcoin and LN on mainnet growing like crazy. Shnorr, Mast and LN make alts ‘irrelevant’ in the coming years. 

Not to mention the MIT research paper that allows Bitcoin signatures go do down 90% in size allowing bitcoin to process 20-25x as many transactions together with segwit, Shnorr and batching, once it gets deployed. 

LN will incentivize more Bitcoin full nodes because now holding bitcoin and running a full node pays. This will allow us to hard fork to a larger blocksize without the risk of losing decentralization, as planned by Core years ago. Read the official scaling plan on bitcoin.org that includes a variable blocksize for BTC.

"> How the hell is Ethereum a scam? 

Among other reasons,

* 75% premined misleadingly advertised by its issuers as 12% premined because they decided to not count the premine they sold (including 'sold' to insiders) as pre-mined.

* A perpetually inflationary monetary policy constructively advertised as not inflationary via misleading total supply graphs in their prospectus.

* ""Unstoppable smart contracts"" immediately stopped and reversed if and only if the issuers personally lost money due to their own ill advised investments in them...

* Claiming their involvement isn't motivated by profit interests while even the publicly disclosed amount of the unspent premine given to a single developer is on the order of a half billion dollars now (I'm not complaining about the windfall, but the dishonest presentation of continuing to hold it as not profit motivated).

... and that's without even getting into all the details on the untruthful ""world computer"" and ""replace facebook"" pumping by paid placement speakers at conferences and meetups before it was launched...

I hope you don't make other decisions based on this flawed kind of thinking. 

Please consider: if you argue that Segwit was causing the Bitcoin Cash fork you would need to argue as well that the pregnancy of your mother was caused by your grand grand grandmom. And that some cosmic incident was causing the creation of the Earth and thus the creation of Bitcoin.

You don't appear to acknowledge that events can have multiple causes. Your examples are obscure, but the 'big bang' is of course a cause for everything else which has followed it.

And another on Obama's impact on job growth:

Ok, /r/iamverysmart.

I haven't posted there regularly in a long time. Pretty much since the sub went full retard in 2015 thanks to Theymos. I still check it often and occasionally chime in (which usually results in people attacking me because I am also a regular in /r/btc). So far I have avoided an outright ban.

> Donald supporters on politics and core supporters on btc might get downvoted to hell, but they don't get banned. The opposite is not true. That's the difference. 

You've got it backwards. /r/btc users get banned on /r/bitcoin all the time. If you don't believe that then I don't know what to tell you. The only reason this sub is popular is because of the mass censorship and constant bans.

"Or vice versa. Either way, we got it turned around somewhere. 

But you originally said that ""/r/bitcoin is /r/politics."" when in fact the ""mass censorship and constant bans"" (your words) are more akin to the_donald. 

Clearly put the analogy is:

Censorship and bans for all dissenting opinions: /r/bitcoin, /r/the_donald

Heavy downvotes for those who go against the hivemind: /r/btc, /r/politics

I mean, that's the observable pattern to an outside user. If you disagree with that, then I'd still argue that some personal bias is causing you to misinterpret the situation. ";3;1;False;;dtmzvy2;MAKE BITCOIN CASH AGAIN;7upr0u;https://i.redd.it/judgsqo46rd01.jpg
"To be fair, I kind of stopped paying attention to /r/the_donald a while ago, maybe it has changed a lot for the worse. American politics is exhausting. I remember like a year or so ago it was gaining a lot of users due to censorship from /r/politics and other subs like /r/news. Sure the headlines were mostly memes and shitposts, but often there was a lot of good conversation in the comment threads that you wouldn't find in most other subs. Also have read many stories about users that have been harassed, vote brigaded and outright banned from various subs simply due to the association. The parallels to me seem pretty close. I also find that /r/bitcoin is way worse for the hivemind aspect than /r/btc (which can be bad at times as well).

Yeah but the point is that other politicians do basically nothing from what they promise or the promises are insignificant changes. Trump may have implemented only 1/5 of his promises but they are still bigger deal than what any other western politician did. You can even claim they are bad changes but he still followed through;-7;2;False;Eirenarch;dtmpg7j;MAKE BITCOIN CASH AGAIN;7upr0u;https://i.redd.it/judgsqo46rd01.jpg

Too lazy to google now but I clearly remember preelection articles on Ars Technica saying that Trump victory would mean NN repeal. Now I doubt Trump ever talked about it (has he said anything about it even now) but the issue must have been on the table somewhere with his team fighting for organic internet.

Double check your news sources.  If you agree with them all the time, find new ones.  It's good to be discerning and challenge that cognitive bias that we all experience at times.

I don't hate Trump, but I am worried about some of the things he's doing.  The economy is doing well at the moment, but it's impossible that Trump can claim much responsibility for it, only a year into office.  I do think cutting the corporate tax rate was a good idea, but his people overstate the impact it will make.";7;2;False;iamjacksragingupvote;dtmux7g;MAKE BITCOIN CASH AGAIN;7upr0u;https://i.redd.it/judgsqo46rd01.jpg

I don’t understand why you are being so downvoted. Donald Trump is making the economy boom again pushing companies to stay in the US instead of moving overseas, renegotiating terrible trade deals which would of cost us many jobs and money and like you said he delivers on his promises he even is pushing ILLEGAL immigrants out of the US and accepting immigrants that will be good constructive citizens not leaching off the government and killing cops. What is there not to like about trump? Trump made companies disclose their throttling so there is not a problem with no net neutrality also just because your poor doesn’t mean we all have to have the same internet speed that’s ridiculous.
