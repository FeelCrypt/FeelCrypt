"you haven't seen the 'dipshit' comment at this point?

I'll let you googlefu it out yourself, it's not hard to find

edit: he publicly called Adam Back and the signers of the HK agreement 'dipshits', which can, and I suspect was, taken as an insult to *everyone* that signed the agreement.

I'm not surprised they are getting pissed and this move by them is brilliant. No matter what 2MB is coming from either Core or Classic at this point.

"Miners don't *control* Bitcoin, but they can certainly exert a great deal of influence over its direction -- particularly in the short-term. (But I agree that the economic majority is ultimately in control.)  Related thoughts:

">The American delegation in China had a software proposal, known as Bitcoin Classic, that would change all that.
The Chinese companies, though, had the ultimate decision-making power over any changes in the software, and they did not agree with the American delegation. The Chinese had thrown in their lot with another group of longtime programmers who wanted to keep Bitcoin smaller, in part to keep it more secure. The Americans hoped to persuade the Chinese to switch sides.
In a hotel conference room, the American team of about a half-dozen people cycled through its PowerPoint slides, in English and Chinese, arguing for expansion of the network, most notably pointing to the long delays that have been plaguing the system as a result of the congestion. The Chinese representatives listened and conferred among themselves. The group took a break for a lunch of lamb and dumplings at a nearby mall.
