"Bitcoin is bitcoin and bitcoin cash is bitcoin cash. BCH is a fork of bitcoin. Even if it accomplishes everything bitcoin set out to do, it will still be bitcoin cash NOT bitcoin. Personally I think that if the developers/marketers of bitcoin cash truly believed in their product then they wouldn’t try and pretend to be bitcoin.

Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin Cash. There is no debate. Stop trying to ride off Bitcoin’s popularity. Bitcoin Cash will prove itself through its merits. There’s no need to piggyback off Bitcoin if you really think it’s the superior coin.

I do not have any sources and don't mean to say core *devs* said this, but rather that I feel like core *supporters* were making this claim. Hell, perhaps I'm just remembering that the big block camp *accused* core supporters of saying this - I don't know. It's certainly easy to believe that random redditors would say that. In any case, Hearn certainly said it would rise quickly, and he was correct.

"I'm quite sympathetic to your viewpoint, and the vast majority of his predictions were false. However, I do want to treat him fairly. I seem to remember many in the Core camp (and I consider myself in this camp) expecting that fees would only marginally rise as blocks filled, and Hearn saying that they would rise substantially and quickly. He was indeed quite correct about this. 

Of course, since the high demand was from a speculative frenzy (of which I hope/expect to see many more), it was transient, and fees are modest again.

"Yeah, but might makes right and therefore you should fall in line and go along with whatever is in the perceived best interests of miners because ""that's how Bitcoin's consensus system works."" This is decentralization, folks. 

Seriously, it is really hard to understand the more general philosophical perspective of people here. I'm sympathetic to a (small) block size increase, but it seems that people here think that validating the chain is useless and we all just ought to trust a handful of powerful miners to not only decide the rules (this is how Bitcoin works, of course) but also that the rules they choose are automatically good. It will be very interesting when governments really start getting involved in this game. An extreme willingness to hard fork changes will make it very easy for powerful entities to use social (or even technical/mining) manipulations to change the rules in their favor.

The devs may have *some* power in that they are the ones who write the code, but anyone can learn to write code, and the devs can't force anyone to run a given piece of software. As you mention here, devs with different ideas wrote software with different rules, some people chose to run that software, UTXO splits happen, and boom: permissionless money. 

The same just isn't true for the miners, who ought not be looked at as *people* with the Bitcoin network's best interest at heart, but rather as profit-seeking automatons. There is nothing wrong with this or reason to be judgmental about it, but we must always keep in mind that miners are integral to the protocol and assumed to be untrusted, by definition. The devs are just people who write code that we may or may not run.";2;0;False;iwantfreebitcoin;dypf1bw;Three years ago today, Mike Hearn published an article explaining exactly what would happen when the 1MB blocksize limit was hit.

Don't be sad. With Bitcoin Cash we don't have to start over because unlike 2013 people all have heard about Bitcoin and crypto and this time people are more willing to listen and more intressted. So adoption can start scaling up explonentially as then thousands of very passionate people start working towards that. This idea is so powerfull, it's definetelly going to shake up the world. The old system is so corrupt and the money so dirty but instead of burning it down, we are building a backup system and show people the benefits of switching over. If enough peopel do switch over then that will even help the old system collapse and pressure more peopel in so switching. ;3;0;False;Kain_niaK;dyojkrj;Three years ago today, Mike Hearn published an article explaining exactly what would happen when the 1MB blocksize limit was hit.
