"Core's failure to **loudly and clearly** denounce the censorship can and should be seen as a statement of support for the censorship.

I could understand staying silent if we were talking about some minor forums that nobody cares about, but that's not the case.

To Core: I'm not trying to be a dick here, but you've got to be able to see that failure to denounce the censorship is severely hurting your reputation. It's become hard for people to *not* think that Core is using theymos as a convenient shield to push an agenda, even if that is not the reality of the situation.

"The only question is: Is Theymos's position as a moderator a net-positive, or a net-negative, for /r/bitcoin and for the bitcoin ecosystem generally? The answer is obvious, and has been obvious for a very long time. At this point the failure rests not simply on Theymos's malignant ""leadership"" tactics, but on those who have not taken steps to remedy the situation. Doing nothing because it's easier and less awkward to do nothing is still a form of action. And it's hurting everyone (ultimately, Theymos included).

" When I go to r/btc Under ""Official Bitcoin.com Links” and ""Noteworthy Links & Services” I do not see a link to bitcoin.org, bitcointalk or r/bitcoin. These are definitely noteworthy services. I have been using bitcoin.org a lot as its a great developer reference. If bitcoin.org not linking to coinbase is “censorship"", why is r/btc censoring? Where is the outrage here?XTnodes.com promotes all clients except core which is “censored”. It provides arguments pro big blocks, but “censors” small block arguments. Why not give users information and choice?

Nobody here complains about their own ""censorship"".

Summary: I believe moderation and editorial policy by owners != censorship. Otherwise you can level censorship accusations vs anybody.The complaints are mostly self-serving hypocrisy.
