"Although there are technical nitpicks about SegWit itself, that's not what split the community. It's three things about SegWit that caused all this...

 1. Core prioritized SegWit before a ""base"" blocksize increase. This was done knowing that the blocks would become full, and fees would rise as is happening now. It was judged to be worth it to battle centralization, force adoption of off chain technology, and purposely create a fee market. The other side (mostly) was not against segregating witness data or adopting second layers, they just wanted Bitcoin to operate like normal until those things came along naturally. They were either ok with, or disagreed with, the arguments about centralization risk and fee markets.

 2. SegWit was done as a soft fork and only had around 30-something% of signalled support at its peak (without 2X). A soft fork is a way to change the Bitcoin protocol in a way that old nodes won't be able to tell that anything is different and won't reject the changes. In software, whether or not something is backwards compatible is often pretty random and often not related to the complexity or scope of change. SegWit is an example of that. SegWit is a drastic change to the code and economics of Bitcoin, and many people felt a soft fork was a way to trick nodes into accepting controversial changes and that it would create unnecessary technical debt and problems during adoption compared to a hard fork.

 3. Many people saw SegWit as a stepping stone towards goals they disagreed with, such as artificially creating a fee market, turning on chain into a settlement layer, and making Bitcoin's primary use into a digital gold rather than peer to peer cash.

I don't think it's semantics.  There is a definable, nuanced difference.  Yes, they both changed the rules, but segwit doesn't break any existing rules.  Bitcoin Cash breaks 2 existing rules (blocksize and difficulty adjustment algorithm).

> They are both just as valid Bitcoin chains

I disagree.  Breaking rules makes it a new altcoin entirely.

My point is that ""lock-in"" doesn't change or upgrade anything.  Yes, I agree it was an emotional day.  I was very excited, but anything could have happened between lock-in and activation.  It was by no means a guarantee.  The segwit rules weren't activated on lock-in day.

> Well if that's the case then increasing the block size and changing the DA also did not break the consensus rules either because they were just upgrades and still compatible with the main chain.

What?  Yes they did break rules.  The consensus rule said that blocks must be less than 1mb.  Bitcoin Cash explicitly *broke* that rule.  Any bitcoin miner or node running at that time would *reject* all Bitcoin Cash blocks.  They are entirely incompatible with the network.  Are you aware of how consensus networks work?

They don't seem to be that far off actually, slightly above 10% of the core branch total. That's underwhelming for segwit especially after the whole USAF NO2X circus.

They had to follow the branch they perceive to have the most support (a self reinforcing state).

"Fair enough. I disagree with the limitations you state, especially that Rasperry Pi's should be able to process *every* payment on this planet (there is simply no need), and also the ""instant"" part, as Bitcoin Cash enables 0-confirmation payments, but we have both models now.

a) Don't you agree that the Lightning UX is very problematic in many ways? On chain transactions are easier by far, much more robust, much easier to implement for businesses and are much easier to onboard new users.

b) You state you want to keep the network decentralized. Yet lightning [can't be decentralized by nature](https://medium.com/@jonaldfyookball/mathematical-proof-that-the-lightning-network-cannot-be-a-decentralized-bitcoin-scaling-solution-1b8147650800).

c) Do you support censoring dissenting opinions? Why do you spent so much time supporting these censored forums? Don't you agree that the community should be allowed to discuss issues openly without moderator intervention?

d) Why do you use terms like ""bcash""? They are very clearly [negatively connotated](https://medium.com/@jonaldfyookball/why-some-people-call-bitcoin-cash-bcash-this-will-be-shocking-to-new-readers-956558da12fb) and you still use the term.

"> This is not what Core proposes with Lightning, in which case Bitcoin is being reduced to become a settlement layer. 

Satoshi was a genius, but even geniuses can't predict the future.

I don't believe it's realistic to put every coffee purchase and every micro transaction on the blockchain, to be stored forever, by thousands of node operators.  I believe that we must keep the base layer as decentralized as possible, so that anyone can run a node on a raspberry pi without much effort.

But we can easily add the cash layer on top of this decentralized, protected base layer.  With Lightning, there is no ""transactions per second"" limit at all, and all transactions are secured *instantly*.  No waiting for 10 or 20 minutes for a block.  This is *much better* than what transactions on the blockchain can do.  Even with GB sized blocks, there is still a ""transactions per second"" limit that will eventually be hit.  So raising the blocksize isn't a solution.  It only addresses the symptoms, not the problem.

If we make the base layer more centralized with larger blocks, where only giant corporations can afford to run nodes, we can never get that decentralized property back on a second layer.

So, as a developer, my opinion is to protect the base layer, and keep it as decentralized as possible, with as many nodes as possible.  Then we scale with 2nd layer payment solutions like Lightning.

Utter bullshit. The lack of segwit usage proves there were no **U**sers. It was all a few loud mouths, some of them who don't use crypto and are just speculators (like Tone Vays and a few of his talk partners who can't even generate an address on the fly) and lots of hats.

The only reason they pushed the voting over the ACTIVATION THRESHOLD was because they didn't want to split the community (the same with the majority which was afraid and the same reason so many went with segwit even calling it ""bitcoin"" at first) and were promised 2MB later. 

Also realize this: you can have a lot of things ossifying in the protocol via softfork before you start throwing ""alt"" around. You can have a reduction of blocksize being implemented as a softfork, old clients accept the smaller size. Once you have enough clients using the smaller size, you can force the old clients to have to hard fork if they want blocks bigger than the pre reduction. Would the old clients be following an alt then? No! Because the bloody limit was not part of the protocol! 

This is how the maxblocksize came into being. It was a hard-coded variable that was not part of the protocol, introduced as minor and temporary thing trivially increasable later on (and not part of the old client).

Well if that's the case then increasing the block size and changing the DA also did not  break the consensus rules either because they were just upgrades and still compatible with the main chain.

Even the Core wallet doesn't support Segwit from the GUI, and hardly anybody has begun the insane task of rewriting wallets to support it. Not to mention, the main developer of Segwit (G Maxwell) is no longer working for Blockstream. 

Supporting Segwit seems to be mostly pointless as it doesn't do anything other than horribly bastardize the transaction format.

"I think we are just arguing semantics now.

I am a software developer and to me a hard fork is a change that requires clients to update software in order to continue functioning. I am sure it depends on the industry and type of software though.

I gave you that link to the developer guide in a previous comment and I have read it. Sure the actual block versions could be considered a ""stricter"" rule update, but they had actual protocol updates tied to them as well, some of which ""loosened"" rules.

Here is the definition by [bitcoin.it](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Hardfork).
> A hardfork is a change to the bitcoin protocol that makes previously invalid blocks/transactions valid, and therefore requires all users to upgrade.

The block 3 version upgrade made the OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY op code valid. So prior to the fork, transactions with that op code were not valid and after it they are. And any user validating blocks would have to update to accept these new transactions or they would no longer be able to validate the chain. Isn't that by definition a hard fork? It is not making rules stricter, like you are saying the definition is.";1;1;False;KarlTheProgrammer;dtfpdrd;"/r/bitcoin is censoring the NIST report that says ""Bitcoin Cash is the original blockchain"" and Bitcoin Core is not.

"No, here's what happened.  The version field in the block header is a 32 byte integer.  Initially, as long as it was a valid 32 byte integer, it was valid.

Since then, they have been slowly softforking additional restrictions.  They started rejected v1, then rejected v2, and so on.  Each time that happens, it's a soft fork, because it doesn't break any rule, it just makes the rule stricter each time.

So we went from a scenario where anything was valid, to a scenario where anything above 1 was valid, to a scenario where anything above 2 was valid and so on.  Each time, the rule gets stricter and stricter, but it never breaks any previous rule.  This is why all of these are soft forks.

It would be the equivalent of making a new rule that says the block size is now 999kb, then a new rule that says the block size is now 998kb, then 997kb.  Each time, the blocksize rule gets stricter, but they are all still under 1mb, so they never broke a consensus rule.

"But it is backwards compatible.

What it looks like is that there was no previous rule.  The block version previously could have been anything.  They created a softfork, that simply said block versions must be at least v2 or higher.

Since block version v2 was previously valid, enforcing v2 blocks didn't break any existing consensus rule, which is why it's a soft fork.

For instance, before this was enforced, you were free to make a block with a v2 version number or higher.  However after this rule went into effect, you were required to.  That's a classic soft fork scenario.

The rule of thumb for soft fork vs hard fork is, ""Does this change break an existing consensus rule?""  If so, it's a hard fork.  If not, it's a soft fork.

In the same way that the Bitcoin UX was problematic when it first came out, 9 years ago.  Developers will make it easier with time.  Take a look at the [Zap wallet](https://github.com/LN-Zap).  Their primary focus is ease of use.  So it's not a long term problem at all in my eyes.

> You state you want to keep the network decentralized. Yet lightning can't be decentralized by nature.

Yet reality proves that article wrong.  Check out the [Lightning network topology](https://lnmainnet.gaben.win/?100=) on mainnet.  A network is centralized if you pick 2 random nodes, and there is only 1 path between them.  A network is decentralzied if there are many paths between them.  The more nodes, the more channels, the more decentralized.  Right now there are many paths between me and most other nodes.  This will be a sliding scale over time.  Regardless though, the more important thing is that the base layer remains as decentralized as possible.  Even if Lightning became more centralized, there is still no third party custodial trust.

Not at all, and I hate that /r/bitcoin engages in it.

Bitcoin Cash's blockchain is not compatible with anything before August 1st.  You keep proving that you don't understand how consensus works.

Bitcoin Cash broke 2 consensus rules when it forked from the Bitcoin network.  That means it is *not* backwards compatible.  It was a hard fork.  What aren't you understanding about this?  What I'm saying isn't controversial.  It's a fact.

Segwit on the other hand (like CSV, P2SH, CLTV, and RBF) were all designed as softforks, which means that they are fully compatible with the existing consensus rules.  None of those upgrades broke any Bitcoin consensus rules.

So again, if you take Bitcoin software from before August 1st, 2017, and turn it on, it will *reject* Bitcoin Cash blocks, but it will *fully sync* with the segwit chain.  This is indisputable proof that Segwit continues the Bitcoin blockchain.";2;1;False;gizram84;dtfkjjh;"/r/bitcoin is censoring the NIST report that says ""Bitcoin Cash is the original blockchain"" and Bitcoin Core is not.

False.  With a soft fork, you need a majority to enforce the new rules, otherwise a chain split can occur.

I think that's a hard fork (intentional or unintentional) by your definition since the old software was rejecting blocks unless the users upgraded their software, correct? 

However, I think you are also saying that since there was consensus among the miners to upgrade their software back then it was not really a hard fork, but a soft fork even though previous versions could not accept the new blocks.

So Bitcoin Cash is not the first hard fork/upgrade, as I always suspected.  The only difference is that there is split in the main chain where one group of miners mine the legacy chain with the new Segwit consensus rule, and another group of miners (some of them are mining both chains) also mine the legacy chain with a modified set of consensus rules (Bitcoin Cash) requiring users to upgrade their software in order to benefit from the new features.

If you were around back then you remember the mining voting and the thresholds people were following for that voting. You also remember that the voting and corresponding activation for segwit were done following the segwitx2x compromise that never came to fruition as the most cynical (and most correct) back then were saying would happen.

The cash branch of Bitcoin was a life raft thrown just before that became obvious to everyone else a few months after and who is a moderate like me who believes real World adoption shouldn't be dropping left and right at this moment over what was obviously a temporary limit, never defined as part of the protocol and promised repeatedly and since its inception to be raised years ago. 

You can almost call it an ""user activated fork"" if will, of Bitcoin, responding to a central activated fork followed by a community over eager to prevent a schism (schism which was guaranteed 2 something years back after some people decided to play dirty).

I agree with this post. This sub does not have anything to fear from factual information and truth. We have no reason to lie. The original Bitcoin is no more. The community split. The software forked. The blockchain was duplicated and the two chains are incompatible with each other. 

So neither Bitcoin Core or Bitcoin Cash can claim that their chain is the original. The original is dead. However the original IDEA is not. And I believe that Bitcoin Cash is more in line with the original idea. Bitcoin Core does not like the original idea, they would like to change the original idea. 

And now they get go their separate way. There are now two witnesses to the original idea and they are segregated.

"I agree, also regardless of anyone's stance on the topic, saying that Segwit ""caused a hardfork"" is either wrong or misleading (yes maybe from a political/social standpoint it caused a hardfork, but is that what we are talking about?). 

Bitcoin Cash purposely changed the block size limit and added replay protection and this requires any node or client to update their software to use Bitcoin Cash and receive Bitcoin Cash blocks and verify transactions. The same (regardless of whether you like it or not) is not true for Segwit as clients could stay on their legacy software and still receive blocks (perhaps as some would argue with degraded security).

>8.1.2      Bitcoin Cash (BCH)

>In 2017, Bitcoin users adopted an improvement proposal for Segregated Witness (known as SegWit, where transactions are split into two segments: transactional data, and signature data) through a soft fork. SegWit made it possible to store transactional data in a more compact form while maintaining backwards compatibility.  However, a group of users had different opinions on how Bitcoin should evolve – and developed a hard fork of the Bitcoin blockchain titled Bitcoin Cash. Rather than implementing the SegWit changes, the developers of Bitcoin Cash decided to simply increase the blocksize. When the hard fork occurred, people had access to the same amount of coins on Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.

"The report is factually incorrect.  It claims that the segwit forked activated *before* the Bitcoin Cash fork, which is wrong.  Bitcoin Cash forked off from Bitcoin on August 1st, when a block greater than 1mb was mined.  Segwit activated three weeks later, continuing the original chain.

It also incorrectly claims that Bitcoin Cash is the continuation of the original chain.  It isn't, because Bitcoin Cash changed two separate consensus rules.  It changed the blocksize, which makes it incompatible with the pre-August Bitcoin network, and it also changed the difficulty adjustment algorim, which also makes it fully incompatible with the pre-August Bitcoin network.

The segwit soft fork didn't split the chain at all when it activated (again 3 weeks after Bitcoin Cash forked).  Segwit is fully compatible with the pre-August Bitcoin network, and is the only continuation of the original chain.

If you need to make up lies to get people to believe you, you have lost.

"> How can Segwit activation not have forked the chain?

You have to understand the difference between a soft fork and a hard fork.  A soft fork doesn't break any existing rules.  It simply adds new rules to the network.  For instance, if the existing rule says that blocks must be under 1mb, and a new rule says that blocks must be under 800kb, that is a soft fork.  Technically, the new blocks (under 800kb) are still compatible with the previous rules.  Even if your node is not upgraded, you will still see the new 800kb blocks as valid.  There is no network split.

That brings us to a hard fork.  A hard fork *breaks* existing rules.  So if the existing rule says that blocks must be under 1mb, and a new rules says that blocks must be under 2mb, then a 1.5mb block would split the network in two.  Non-upgraded nodes will reject the 1.5mb block, but upgraded nodes would say it's perfectly fine.

Segwit was designed as a soft fork.  Segwit txs and blocks are valid to old, non-upgraded nodes.  There are just some new rules that went into effect, mainly dealing with how to verify the signatures, which the old nodes don't see.

> Segwit transactions were not valid before it was activated and now they are.

Technically segwit txs were valid before segwit activated, they would have just been seen as ""anyone can spend"" txs back then.  But they would have been perfectly valid and happily mined into blocks.  No nodes would have rejected them.";15;1;False;gizram84;dtf104k;"/r/bitcoin is censoring the NIST report that says ""Bitcoin Cash is the original blockchain"" and Bitcoin Core is not.

1056 In July 2017, approximately 80 to 90 percent of the Bitcoin computing power voted to

1057 incorporate Segregated Witness (SegWit, where transactions are split into two segments:

1058 transactional data, and signature data), which made it possible to reduce the amount of data being

1059 verified in each block. Signature data can account for up to 65 percent of a transaction block, so

1060 a change in how signatures are implemented could be useful. When SegWit was activated, it

1061 caused a hard fork, and all the mining nodes and users who did not want to change started calling

1062 the original Bitcoin blockchain Bitcoin Cash (BCC). Technically, Bitcoin is a fork and Bitcoin

1063 Cash is the original blockchain. When the hard fork occurred, people had access to the same

1064 amount of coins on Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.""


Bitcoin Cash is a fork.  Bitcoin Segwit is a fork.  Neither is the true legacy chain.

"> Segwit2x and BIP91 lock-in date was Block 476768 

Segwit2x never activated and is irrelevant.  BIP91 lock-in also changed nothing.  Segwit (BIP141) activated on [block 481,824](https://www.coindesk.com/50-blocks-segwit-bitcoins-coming-upgrade-blockchain-game-changer/), on August 24th, 2017.  That's three weeks after Bitcoin Cash forked.  This is an indisputable fact.

> In order to preserve the main chain free of both segwit and RBF transactions, the Bitcoin hard fork had to occur prior to segwit activation at Block 481,824.

The Bitcoin Cash hard fork didn't ""have"" to be any time.  A few developers chose to fork off of the Bitcoin network on August 1st, and create their own altcoin, which broke at least two Bitcoin consensus rules, making it fully incompatible with the Bitcoin network.  This happened three weeks before segwit activated.

> Consensus rules were changed with the Segwit lock-in and the inclusion of RBF.

Not a single Bitcoin consensus rule was broken with the activation of segwit, RBF, CLTV, CSV, P2SH, or a number of other useful upgrades over the years.  These were all soft forks, designed to be compatible with the existing Bitcoin blockchain.  You're trying to blur the line between soft forks and hard forks.  Soft forks continue the existing chain, and break no consensus rules.  Hard forks split away from the existing chain, and break existing consensus rules.  You need to acknowledge this difference.

> changing the block size and the difficulty adjustment also changed these rules but were also backwards compatible (like Segwit) with the original chain

This is 100% false.  They were incompatible.  You have to download new software and re-import your keys to gain access to your coins on this new blockchain.  Just because they copied the existing ledger balances means nothing.  The software is incompatible.

Here's a test.  Take Bitcoin software that's really old, like 2014 or 2015.  Turn it on.  See which chain it syncs with.  It will explicitly *reject* Bitcoin Cash blocks, and it will happily *accept* segwit blocks.  It will sync fully with the Bitcoin network today.  This proves, without a shadow of a doubt, that the segwit chain is the continuation of the existing Bitcoin chain from before August.  Bitcoin Cash is an altcoin that is incompatible.";12;2;False;gizram84;dtfdvtm;"/r/bitcoin is censoring the NIST report that says ""Bitcoin Cash is the original blockchain"" and Bitcoin Core is not.

">It claims that Segwit activated before the BCH fork, which is wrong. BCH forked off from Bitcoin on August 1st, when a block greater than 1mb was mined. Segwit activated three weeks later, continuing the original chain.

Segwit2x and BIP91 lock-in date was Block 476768 (2017-07-21 00:06Z), which was 10-days prior to the August 1st Bitcoin fork at 12:20Z.  Segwit activation occurred at Block 481,824  (2017-08-24 01:57Z) with the 2 MB activation scheduled at Block 494,784 (which never happened). In order to preserve the main chain free of both segwit and RBF transactions, the Bitcoin hard fork had to occur prior to segwit activation at Block 481,824.

>It also incorrectly claims that BCH is the continuation of the original chain. It isn't, because BCH changed two separate consensus rules. It changed the block size, which makes it incompatible with the pre-August Bitcoin network, and it also changed the difficulty adjustment algorithm, which also makes it fully incompatible with the pre August Bitcoin network.

Consensus rules were changed with the Segwit lock-in and the inclusion of RBF. Changing the block size and the difficulty adjustment also changed these rules but were also backwards compatible (like Segwit) with the original chain otherwise people who had bitcoins before the August 1st would no longer have their bitcoins on the new chain.  Incompatibility with the existing bitcoin network only meant new transactions and block creation had to occur on the new chain.

>Segwit soft fork didn't split the chain at all when it activated (again 3 weeks after BCH forked). Segwit is fully compatible with the pre-August Bitcoin network, and is the only continuation of the original chain.

Think of the August 1st fork as an upgrade, like Microsoft occasionally did with MS Work and Excel where there are new features and perhaps a new file format, but you can still run your old docs and spreadsheets on the new upgrade because it’s backward compatible. Of course, one could reasonably assert,  as the NIST authors are doing, that Segwit is the new upgrade, and Cash is just returning to the original Bitcoin protocol changing only the maximum block size to improve network capacity and changing the difficulty adjustment so it can coexist with the new Bitcoin Segwit upgrade.";1;2;False;clone4501;dtfd4sv;"/r/bitcoin is censoring the NIST report that says ""Bitcoin Cash is the original blockchain"" and Bitcoin Core is not.

> You also remember that the voting and corresponding activation for segwit were done following the segwitx2x compromise that never came to fruition as the most cynical (and most correct) back then were saying would happen.

Revisionist history.  I remember that the UASF was scheduled to go into effect on August 1st, so the miners had a choice.  They could start signaling to activate segwit, or they could have their blocks rejected by the network.  Right before the UASF activated, 100% of the miners started signaling for segwit.  I predicted that the 2x portion would never go through, and the miners would back out before the November hard fork.  I was right.

> The cash branch of Bitcoin was a life raft thrown just before..

Yes, that's what I said.  Bitcoin Cash hard forked off of the Bitcoin network *before* segwit activated.  We're in agreement.  The reasons are just emotions.  The only thing that matters is the technicals.  The NIST report falsely claims that Segwit activated *before* Bitcoin Cash.  That is factually incorrect, as I pointed out.

I never supported the banning in r/bitcoin. I used to prefer this subreddit although I never had a strong opinion that we desperately needed bigger blocks, never thought Blockstream conspiracy theories were realistic, thought LN was a good idea etc. I thought the fork would be good for holders because we'd get to just see which scaling method worked. However, I don't like what I've seen from BCH proponents or in this subreddit. As if bitcoin has to die for bitcoin cash to succeed.

"Those are ticker symbols for traders.  There is more to Bitcoin then trading it or using Bitcoin just as an investment.

/r/btc now stands for BiTCoin, just like /r/bitcoin stands for Bitcoin.

No, people aren't using btc to trade on exchanges anymore. Congrats guys, your mempool is shrinking because no one is using your slow expensive coin anymore. But I guess that's what they want, just a store of value.
