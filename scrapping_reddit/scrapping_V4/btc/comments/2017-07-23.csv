I'm not arguing against that at all.  The question was what's the downside to a bigger block size.  The answer is it costs more to store and validate the blockchain.  But that doesn't mean we can't increase the block size to some limit that balances cost with demand.  So I support increasing the block size.;4;0;False;loveforyouandme;dkla0oe;Miners right now.;6oty7x;http://i.gifntext.com/XONq3rINt7.gif

Right, and either the choice will be made clear on both subreddits, or the shutdown of the legacy chain aka ""**Bitcoin Jr.**"" will cause an immense amount of anger towards /r/bitcoin for preventing people from being able to get necessary information to keep operating after the split.

That may be the death knell for /r/bitcoin or at least /r/bitcoin's bullshit censorship.  People will be livid at them for preventing real information from being provided, especially when the miners plans have been clear for months in advance.

"How do you invent something and never test it?  

How do you trust someone at their word when you don't know them?

How has ASICBOOST been proven to not have been used?

I would have credited Jihan as have helping the bitcoin community if he made his asicboost open source.  But he patented it and is preventing other people from using it, while assuming the right to use it himself.

He's not legally bound to telling you the truth and it is more profitablto lie to you.  So why wouldn't he?  

This isn't a character attack.  This is an analysis on incentive and it rests on the fact I don't know Jihan, but I do know that he doesn't mind holding bitcoin hostage.

"Doing this is quite hard because all new developers  are attracted to experts. And rightfully so, because of all the good work they have done over years. You also have to ask why are all the experts going to core? Because they maybe correct. 


Competing with them to be called expert would require another improvement like libsecp256k1. A mere blocksize change does not show expertise. It just shows difference in ideas, not expertise. Expertise would be doing it carefully, by thinking about all the problems we can solve of are indeed doing a HF. Maybe change the header structure for better utilisation.

"> given that the vast majority of nodes still run Core and aren't likely to change in a mere 3 months.

Nodes don't have the power to sustain a chain.

95% of the miners are signaling /NYA/ or signatories to the agreement and most have re-affirmed their support of the agreement.  The ONLY pool not signaling for segwit2x is clearly the core shill pool slush, but

1. They don't actually own their miners, it is all opt-in.
2. They have a history of giving people the power to vote and they split the slushpool hashrate accordingly; ~20% of their hashpower supports BU for example.

With 95% consensus the legacy chain aka ""**Bitcoin Jr.**"" will go from 300k tx/day to 7 blocks a day, aka a maximum of ~30k tx/day.  With a ~22 hour confirmation time.  This will last for at least 6 months before the difficulty adjusts.  Meanwhile a great many exchanges are either supporters or signatories, and a few of the ones that aren't have stated they will follow the most POW chain.

The legacy chain is going to be essentially unusable.  But even worse, it may not even have a price at all, or merchants/businesses to accept the coins.  The nodes literally do not matter, they will upgrade to segwit2x to have a usable bitcoin again, or fork off to small-blocker POW change coin that no one will give a shit about.

"New developers attracted to experts are fools.  If they themselves aren't experts, how can they know who are the real experts?

How does expertise in coding up a mathematical algorithm for digital signature checking have anything to do with designing network protocols that must take into account computer and communications systems performance, game theory and economics?  

It looks like the world is full of many people who can't think for themselves and/or won't make the effort to think for themselves.  People like these are sheep and can expect the slaughterhouse.
