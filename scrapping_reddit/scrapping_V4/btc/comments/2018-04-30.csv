The answer is not going to come from inside the system. I think we should just let it collapse in on itself. Bitcoin pulled the rug out from underneath the central banks and so they took over the core dev team and started spewing propaganda against upgrading the network. Now they are trying to take over the payment network with LN. But LN is needlessly complex, poorly thought out, and requires too much effort for users to adopt. If it ever works as described, it will be too little too late in order to save BTC and the central banks will have effectively killed bitcoin except for the fact that BCH exists.

"> Lol a bitcoin bank? Isnt that what the hardcore bitcoin users are against?

No we're not against the concept of banking in general. We're against the current existing banks that are essentially an extension of the US government, who profit on government inflation and are against adoption of bitcoin because it will cut into their current death-grip on transaction fees.

The kind of banks that would arise after we win, that would use crypto, would be allies, adopters of crypto. We'd be perfectly happy to deal with such people. 

Coinbase already acts a lot like a bank for crypto, it would be a lot like that. I bet they transition into that over time.

Disagree. It certainly has the potential to do so. You're speaking the language of the basic bitch opportunist.

"It's not necessary.  I with everything here as far as government goes.

As for the takeover of the core team, it's possible, but I think some people there just genuinely have a different vision, or are just outright nuts (Luke Jr.).  

While I of course prefer BCH over BTC and have swapped a lot of my holdings over to it, I am pretty skeptical that it has actually fixed the vulnerability.  Bitcoin's consensus mechanism failed, and BCH while it fixed the technical issue at the moment, it only slightly modified the consensus mechanism and only in regard to that one variable.  I am really disappointed that more hasn't been done to fix this.

My current pick for a good solution is Dash.  They have the same scaling solution (at least short term) as the Masternodes have voted to increase blocksize to keep the transaction fee below 1 US cent.  They also have a consensus mechanism that insures those with a vested interest in the network are the ones making decisions and not just whoever is loudest.  We also get to know for sure what support levels are.  That blocksize vote was 80% in favor.  The Dash network can be polled so people can see what it intends to do.  The masternode system also pays it's nodes completely eliminating any possibility that they could loose too many of them, and it enables instant transactions, something that means a lot for POS.

I was hopeful that BCH would adopt some of these concepts, as I think it's failure to do so will inevitably result in another consensus issue, especially if it manages to depose BTC as the largest coin.

So for the moment I see BCH the less technically viable but larger of the two best candidates for the digital cash use case.  

Neither of these coins are sole saviors of the threat to central banking.  There are a great many forks of Bitcoin and more can be made at any time.  The cat is out of the bag and central banks will have competition from one coin or another, it's wasn't all on BTC, and it isn't all on BCH now.

"**Bir Tawil**

Bir Tawil or Bi'r Tawīl (Egyptian Arabic: بير طويل‎ Bīr Ṭawīl  [biːɾ tˤɑˈwiːl] or بئر طويل Bi’r Ṭawīl, meaning ""tall water well"") is a 2,060 km2 (800 sq mi) area along the border between Egypt and Sudan, which is uninhabited and claimed by neither country. When spoken of in association with the neighbouring Hala'ib Triangle, it is sometimes referred to as the Bir Tawil Triangle, despite the area's quadrilateral shape; the two ""triangles"" border at a quadripoint.

Its terra nullius status results from a discrepancy between the straight political boundary between Egypt and Sudan established in 1899, and the irregular administrative boundary established in 1902. Egypt asserts the political boundary, and Sudan asserts the administrative boundary, with the result that the Hala'ib Triangle is claimed by both, and Bir Tawil by neither.

So what will? A competing currency that people actually use and can take over that 99.9% market share, but how? Explain in six words or less how to use Bitcoin so it may be understood by a 60+ year old grandma, or my dad who still doesn't own a cell phone, or those who don't see a problem with fiat because they can pay all their bills with it and go about their lives normally. Fiat can be explained very simply: ""hand bills to person to pay bill"". Bitcoin needs a phone and active service to work. You have to generate the code to pay or send Bitcoin via text message. Or you could just hand physical paper to someone else, which is much faster, easier and simplier. 

I know I know, you're going to respond with ""taxation is theft"" or ""inflation destroys your purchasing power"", etc. But those are all existential fears or ones they've already learned to live with (like taxation). Is Bitcoin easier to use than fiat? Is it faster (for the consumer)? Is it more secure for the consumer? Do they receive a discount for using it? 

You can't destroy a currency that has been in use for over 200 years without something better, easier and safer to use.";0;1;False;TamponShotgun;dy7pk3g;Let's End the War and focus on the TRUE ENEMY;8fth52;https://imgur.com/spE6usZ.png

">Let people use fiat if they want.

Unfortunately there’s not much about the fiat system that can be considered voluntary. Borrowing from an old comment of mine:

*What* gives fiat *value* is the wrong question. Value is subjective. *People* assign (differing and subjective) values to fiat based on their perceptions and preferences. A better question is what gives fiat its *price* -- in terms of the quantity of goods / services that a person must spend in order to ""buy"" a given quantity. Price is determined by the intersection of supply and demand. In order to have a ""supply"" in an economic sense, a good needs to be scarce. Where does fiat's (relative) scarcity come from? Well, that does in fact come from men with guns granting a violence-backed monopoly on fiat's issuance to a privileged elite. What about the demand side? Well, government violence plays a role there as well. Taxes collected via threat of violence are payable exclusively in fiat. Legal tender laws (enforced via violence) are another way that fiat is given a privileged position in the market for money. And would-be money competitors are also disadvantaged by things like taxation on capital gains when trading, e.g. appreciated precious metals (even if that ""appreciation"" is only an artifact of fiat's depreciation). As I say, Bitcoin uses a blockchain protected by proof of work. Fiat uses debt chains protected by proof of violence.";1;0;False;Capt_Roger_Murdock;dy7ebq0;Let's End the War and focus on the TRUE ENEMY;8fth52;https://imgur.com/spE6usZ.png

I really love the idea of verifiable/auditable tangibly backed stablecoins. But relative to something like BTC/BCH where there is no middleman, just you, the key, the token, I’m not convinced stablecoins can truly be *the* future of crypto, but will definitely be a part of it.  

Agree that people wanting minimal volatility will likely gravitate to these types of coins and unlike Tether, being backed by gold etc makes them resistant to inflation/loss of buying power aka Fiat.

Lmao what a dumb article. ""One day everyone will jump to Bitcoin cuz it's superior. I won't detail the steps leading up to this point, but just one day everyone will come to their senses and realize it's better and dump all fiat."" Can you explain how Bitcoin is meant to destroy a currency that is backed by a government, complete with laws, mints, etc all working toward making more? We still make pennies and that costs us an absurd amount more than they're worth, but we still make them. But you say that everyone will just magically dump fiat one day. How?

Also, ""hyperbitcoinization"" is not a word. It's just rapid dumping of a currency, like what happened in Zimbabwe, then the government demonetized the previous, hyperinflated currency and introduced the new currency. It wasn't called ""hyperzimbabwedollarization"".

But this is the quality of articles I can expect out of someone who makes up words to sound like that understand economics.

They don't have complete control yet. They would have to take control of mining first--and they haven't gotten that far. But they have made rumblings in that direction so we might see it soon. If they change the proof-of-work algo, that would boot every existing miner off of BTC, and they would have complete control of bitcoin.

If that happened, I can't imagine that the price of BTC wouldn't plummet catastrophically, so they need to make it happen in a way that it wouldn't. Surely they want to do this, Blockstream / Core has even talked about creating their own tamper-proof mining hardware and about changing the PoW.

But they will have to get Lightning / Liquid running I think before they can do that. And what they will likely do is establish a side-chain with their own mining equipment. Once that is running, they can switch Lightning over to their side-chain, decouple it from BTC and just run their own private blockchain with their private mining hardware. **Then BTC doesn't get replaced, it just dies on the vine.**

They will have killed it, by neglect, not with a knife.
