"It doesn't necessarily have to be OP, but the manipulation I'm talking about is a a person or group who controls more than one reddit account and uses those accounts to vote more than their ""fair share"" (at least by reddit standards).

It's particularly useful for ""forum sliding"", where good posts can be kept off of the front page not just by downvoting them, but also by upvoting lower quality posts to be higher than the target post, ""sliding"" the target post out of view from anyone who would have seen it otherwise.

It could be performed by a single asshole with nothing better to do, all the way up to large corporations and governments. Given that it's most certainly profitable for the latter groups to do so, you can be sure it's happening. It is, of course, impossible to identify specific instances of it 100% for sure, though, which is why I say that this post has ""almost definitley"" been vote manipulated.";1;0;False;AD1AD;ehh2la3;when you become a crypto trader...;att3zw;https://i.redd.it/87j31n7fz9i21.png
"Curious as to what you mean by manipulated?  Not trying to troll, just wonders how it happens. 

Do you mean OP has a large number of accounts they control and the use them to upvote all of their content? Or is there a larger conspiracy?";1;1;False;bloatedbeached_whale;ehh22gp;when you become a crypto trader...;att3zw;https://i.redd.it/87j31n7fz9i21.png
