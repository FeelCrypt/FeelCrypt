"Yes.  Bill Gates did a recent AMA and one was about cryptocurrency in general.  And he basically said he’s not big on it, one of cryptocurrencies biggest draws, being anonymity, will be it’s biggest downfall if it goes big/mainstream.  Governments don’t want this and they ultimately control these things.  Sure they haven’t enforced anything yet because it’s all an experiment and still very early adaptation vs real world currency.

Ripple is an entirely different beast then most if not all cryptocurrencies.  So there’s definite possibilities but as you eleoquently put- still many hurdles and unknowns.  People here go way to crazy on the positive sausage rubbing button. It’s good to be positive but also discuss fundamentals, hurdles, etc to get a better picture and realistic idea of what to expect.

This is a copy pasta response from Bill Gates AMA when a user asked about his opinion on cryptocurrency (note, this is not ripple but cryptocurrencies in general- still relatable to an extent)

“The main feature of crypto currencies is their anonymity. I don't think this is a good thing. The Governments ability to find money laundering and tax evasion and terrorist funding is a good thing. Right now crypto currencies are used for buying fentanyl and other drugs so it is a rare technology that has caused deaths in a fairly direct way. I think the speculative wave around ICOs and crypto currencies is super risky for those who go long.”

"[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-stake#Criticism) explains why POS isn't all sunshine and rainbows as many people think.

>Some authors argue that proof of stake is not an ideal option for a distributed consensus protocol. One issue that can arise is the ""nothing-at-stake"" problem, wherein block generators have nothing to lose by voting for multiple blockchain histories, thereby preventing consensus from being achieved. Because unlike in proof-of-work systems, there is little cost to working on several chains, anyone can abuse this vulnerability by attempting to double spend ""for free"".

This problem is being worked on and POS may be the future. An example of this would be the Ethereum's [GHOST protocol](https://www.cryptocompare.com/coins/guides/what-is-the-ghost-protocol-for-ethereum/). But for now POW is really the only game in town.

You're fishing for the idea that bitcoin has a higher marketcap than bitcoin cash and that's supposed to make it better? It's always had a higher marketcap because it's always had the initial momentum. But look at bitcoin dominance, and it's below 50% these days. It was like 95% when I bought my first bitcoins. Bitcoin is in a slow decline for like 2 years now to altcoins. You whine about bitcoin cash, while ethereum eats your lunch. We told you bitcoin would lose markets share to other coins if you didn't raise the blocksize.

I've been meaning to buy a replacement part from them for a few weeks.  When I saw they accept bitpay, I figured I'd wait for BCH support.
