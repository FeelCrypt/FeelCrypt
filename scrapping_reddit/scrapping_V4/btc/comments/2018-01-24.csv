No, Bitcoin stops things like charge back fraud and central banks manipulating your currency.

You can already live 100% on Bitcoin, it just isn't for the average person yet. Which we hope will become normal at some point in the future.

This is what you have escrow for, at least unless something much more advanced gets integrated into Bitcoin. Satoshi had plans, but they might have been for side chains.

Charge back fraud is an outcome from abusing fraud protection mechanisms, so without any of those mechanisms it's obvious that they can't be abused, but honestly that's like saying that you should buy a boat and live on the sea since you'll avoid 100% of car crashes.

> central banks manipulating your currency

That's not what fraud is.

> You can already live 100% on Bitcoin, it just isn't for the average person yet.

Then you can't lead a normal life. If you can't live a life without touching any form of fiat, be it through credit cards, physical cash, bank accounts, etc, then you can't ditch them 100%.

> This is what you have escrow for, at least unless something much more advanced gets integrated into Bitcoin.

Sure, but that still isn't any form of fraud protection, it's exactly the same as with paying for things in cold hard cash, which ties into your next statement:

There are two schools of thought on first cars, one is to get a nice, safe, new car that will keep your kiddies safe and be useful for a long time, the other is to get them some trashy junker in the style they like (convertible, muscle car, whatever) that they (or you) can buy in cash, and toss them to the wolves. If you don't know, the junker is the way to go 100%, because they are gonna fSk up whatever car you get them, and you don't want to start your adult life with a huge car note, and a wreck in your driveway. Everyone I know that started with a new car regretted it, unless it survived 10 years, and if it did survive, they still would have been better off buying used, and skipping the debt. Sending grandma a computer code to her infected PC with the value of a house is a recipe for disaster, and not just it declines in value, you need to learn how to USE and STORE this stuff, and when you learn the hard way what a crypto is, you want to learn with a few thousand Dogecoin, and not your total net worth. Once they have been in it a year and know what cold storage and hardware wallets are, then they can up the percentage, when they are ready. Also, I think until the altcoin market shakes out, we are at a short term top, so its a non-ideal time to go all in. The cryptos are partying like its 1999 internet 1.0 time, and there will be a MUCH better time to get all in, once the froth blows off. And no, we will not need 1000+ trash coins 10 years from now, just like every town no longer has its own phone company that uses barbed wire as a telephone line, like they did at the start of the telephone age. The phone was actually a world-changing invention, and made investors tons of money, but history showed that that was not the right time for n00bs to go 50% + on this telephone future, and its the same for crypto today;3;2;False;triplewitching2;dt6krjt;"CNBC - ""That's what the crypto kids called 'getting rekt'""";7snliz;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7h6oWYYius&feature=youtu.be

"I agree with you and had a similar experience. I just think if many people are implementing many alternatives with hardly any fees (which they are already looking at new plugins-  https://github.com/sanchaz/bitcoin-cash-payments-for-woocommerce), it would be difficult for them to come back on the scene at a later date, some of the new plugins look like donation-ware, they don't even store the funds they are just directly transferred to your receiving address.

Keeping anything enabled in their service / structure has a cost. Keeping Bitcoin supported, handling the (likely growing) amount of support requests, etc. all has a cost. A few employees a year puts the cost near $100k/yr easily.

Also consider that they have an uphill battle to fight. I'm a Bitcoin supporter since 2011 and I was around when Stripe first enabled support for accepting coin as payment - I was actively using their API already when they released the Beta to accept coins.

I don't use Stripe for accepting coins because it's confusing for merchants and support staff.

"> But those channels will be updated very rarely, only when that specific user spends money, so they're not problematic.

If the LN is to be widely adopted, most users and most payments will be in that class.  

Those users are expected to make at least 1 payment per day, on average.  If there are  10 million users, that is already 4 times the current volume of BTC transactions.  And each LN payment will be at least 5 channel payments...

> Not all of them will be active at once but ok, let's say close to a million nodes

Again, the purpose of the LN is to let bitcoin scale to 100 times that number, and let people use bitcoins like they use credit cards, without waiting for Moore's Law.  

> onion routing as applied to LN is not about the IP adresses at all, it's about using the same method to hide where the money is coming from and going to. Each node unwraps their layer of encryption to discover to whom to send next.

Are you sure, or are you guessing?

Even if that were the case, the path finder node will know exactly which LN users (represented by LN user ID numbers)  are in the path; and the information about channel payments, that each user must broadcast to all path finders (all other users, in the current implementation), must be open, and must identify the channel -- hence the LN user IDs.

> I think that problem becomes smaller as the network grows and becomes more connected.

The bottlenecks will be in the immediate vicinity of the source and destination nodes.    The size of the network will not matter; what will matter is the averge number of channels per user, and the capacities of those channels.

For example, suppose that you have 60 BTC locked in 4 channels, funded with 15 bitcoins each in both directions; and you have only 10 BTC of capacity remaining in each channel.  You still have 40 BTC unspent, but you cannot make a payment of 11 BTC to anyone.  

You could do a circular payment to yourself and ""top up"" the capacity of one channel with some of the capacity from other channels.  However, the max capacity of any of those channels is 30 BTC, so you still cannot make a 31 BTC payment to anyone.

Your four immediate neighbors may have the same problem: it may be that all their outgoing channels, except those to you, have capacities below 5 BTC.  Then you cannot make a 6 BTC payment, even though all your channels could handle it.  

> connection bandwidth [is equivalent to LN channel capacity].

Not at all.  For one thing, once a packet got through a link, its capacity is still the same.  Once a pament went through an LN channel, its capacity is permanently reduced.  

Also, packet routing does not need to take capacities into account for every packet.  Load balancing between alternate links is done separately, at a higher level and at lower pace, by fiddling with the routing tables.

>  These doesn't seem relevant to routing, it happens after a path is chosen.

No, when a packet is injected into the internet, it does not know which path it will follow.  (That is the essence of ""packet routing"", the huge breakthrough that distinguished the internet from the ""circuit routing"" used by the phone networks of the 1970s.) 

If the packet's destination IP is outside of your ISP, the ISP just sends it to a backbone provider.  The latter then will either deliver it to another ISP, or push it forward to some other backbone provider.  The internet has ""routing"" but no ""path finding"".

> Not in LN either, if it uses a distributed routing algorithm.

But that is the point: there is no disctributed path-finding algorthm that would let the LN scale better than raw bitcoin.  At the moment, the algorithms one can think of scale much worse.  

> This is similar to the ""network of big hubs"" topology that many expect LN to become. 

Indeed, the hubs will have an even stronger motivation to fuse than mining pools have.  A single large hub will be *a lot* more efficient and profitable than two hubs of half its size.  

So the LN, if it were to become reality, would almost certainly be one big hub, with every user connected to it by one channel.  It will be as centralized as Visa, and **more** centralized than the credit card (or banking) industry is today.  And of course **much** more expensive, clunky, unsafe, slow, inefficient, etc.

> Routing algorithms don't depend or work better on physical networks

Packet routing on the internet works because there is a hierarchy of central entities that collectively know the topology of the physical network, and where each IP is attached to it.  Interenet routing is decentralized at the packet level because the gateways between physical networks need only know the sets of IPs that are on the parts of the network that they are attached to.

LN payment routing cannot do that.  Because of the capacities and the need to negotiate atomic multhop transfers, it must find the complete path beforehand.

> >  it assumes that sending a message from any user to any user is an atomic operation.

> Does it?

Yes, it uses the internet as a big black box that connects any IP to any IP, and does not care about the routing of internet packets.  

If it uses onion routing for the messages, then that is another conceptual layer between the internet and the LN.  For the LN, sending an (onion) message from any user to any user is still one atomic operation.  For the onion routing layer, sending a message from any onion node to any onion node (through the internet) is one atomic operation.";1;0;False;jstolfi;dt69rib;"The Lightning Network is not at ""alpha release"" stage.

">Consider the typical user who receives a salary once a month and then spends it piecewise during that month. Most of the time, the payments through his channels will be all in the same direction (out).

But those channels will be updated very rarely, only when that specific user spends money, so they're not problematic.

>It is hard to estimate the number of active of bitcoin users, but optimistically they are several million. Thus a million nodes is what the LN should handle *now*.

Not all of them will be active at once but ok, let's say close to a million nodes, seems like a good goal.

>Moreover, the LN is meant to let bitcoin scale, faster than Moore's Law; so what matters is how it would handle hundreds of millions of users, not a few thousand.

Eventually, of course that's the objective. But right now as long as it helps enough to keep fees low, that's already useful and can then be improved upon to scale much more over time.

>That's because each LN payment will require 5-10 channel payments.

6 degrees of Kevin Bacon, Bitcoin being a much smaller network than the human species it's likely that you'll almost always need less than 6 hops.

>Only if they delegate path finding to some (ahem) trusted service. 

You're right, giving a bad route to someone can delay their transaction or increase fees (by doing more hops or passing through more expensive nodes).

>Onion routing will only hide the IPs of the computers who are sending the messages.

No, onion routing as applied to LN is not about the IP adresses at all, it's about using the same method to hide where the money is coming from and going to. Each node unwraps their layer of encryption to discover to whom to send next. 

It can be combined with Tor to hide IP addresses as well. 

>Path finding will not be possible if that information is obfuscated. Once the KGB (who will happen to be running that path finding service) determines that node 111552 is Alice and node 552551 is Zoe...

That's a good point, I guess that some conditions must be met for your transaction to be relatively hard to find, mostly being of low value.

>No, ""failure"" means the system will not be able to find a working path between you and the merchant, even though you still have enough funding left in your channels.

Doesn't that mean that there are no (or almost none) available paths to the merchant? I think that problem becomes smaller as the network grows and becomes more connected.

>Many of these channel payments will have to be broadcast *promptly*, as separate messages, to all path finders. 

This seems to reinforce the idea that LN is mostly suited for small payments. The less frequently big payments happen, channel imbalances that need to be broadcast also will be less frequent.

>For one thing, there is no concept equivalent to the balance of payment channes,

There is, connection bandwidth. It's damn near equivalent actually.

>and no need to broadcast information about every packet hop to every gateway in the world.

Not in LN either, if it uses a distributed routing algorithm.

>Internet packets travel one hop at a time: there is no need to negotiate the entire path from scratch, with all gateways, before sending each packet.

These doesn't seem relevant to routing, it happens after a path is chosen.

>Each telecom company that owns and operates a part of the physical network has a central server that knows the IPs of its users and how to phisically reach them; and it will send packets addressed for other IPs to other telecom companies that it has gateways to. 

This is similar to the ""network of big hubs"" topology that many expect LN to become. While that topology isn't great for competition, it does make path finding simpler.

>More generally, the LN has no concept of physical network.

Routing algorithms don't depend or work better on physical networks, if anything they work worse because then you have to deal with all the unexpected quirks and failure modes of real-life hardware.

>it assumes that sending a **message** from any user to any user is an atomic operation.

Does it?

>Even so, a suitable path finding algorithm for the LN is still missing.

This is probably right, but it doesn't seem like an impossible problem. We might have to settle for a ""good enough"" algorithm that fails occasionally and is a bit annoying, though.
