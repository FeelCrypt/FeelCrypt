"I think that ""spam filtering"" is against the vision of ""censor-free money"", the only good way to combat spam is to have a fee-level high enough to make it unattractive to spam.  (possible exception, the old ""priority queue""-algorithm in Bitcoin may have been a good idea).

Spam seems to be mostly a theoretical problem (with one notable exception - the smallblockers are probably right when they claim someone has been deliberately filling the mempool with junk transactions from time to time just to ""prove a point"").

If it would be completely for free to send transactions, there is nothing preventing people from using the block chain as backup storage.  The fact that this apparently hasn't been a problem so far does not prevent it from becoming a problem in the future.  A recommended minimum fee of 1 satoshi pr byte (as is the current practice in Bitcoin Cash) makes real transactions dirt cheap while it's still very expensive to use the block chain as a general data storage, so it seems like a good balance.";1;1;False;tobixen;ds47qtl;"I signed a 1.27 USD fee transaction 3 weeks ago.

"Its not ""religious"". That piece of text defined bitcoin, what it is for and how it achieves it. If it doesnt fall into the given concept, then it isnt bitcoin.

Currently btc isnt ""decentralized"". And with every day its drifting further away from that. 

And since a code that drifts from the main blockchain idea is an altcoin, BTC is currently and Altcoin privately managed by a centralizing entity,  which clearly says in its name whats its purpose  (Block""stream"" - a limited, controlled , thin current of water). 

>Then why are you all trying to co-opt bitcoin name and say bcash is bitcoin?

I´m not co-opting anything. The whitepaper clearly states what is bitcoin. And any literate person can see that currently BTC isn´t it. 

It´s the same case of ""democracy"" and ""freedom"" for the US :)

>My biggest coinmplain against BCH is it's centralized and it's trying to steal bitcoin's brand recognition.

It goes with the original design tho (at least a lot more than the blockstream version). And it benefit a lot more people than the rich ones that don´t care about paying 100$ in fees and waiting a couple of days to get their crypto.

It’s like this:  if you knew what made a duck because it was defined:  “quacks, walks like a duck, has feathers, loves to swim, etc” and then you had a duck...  and you knew it was a duck because it matched the definition... Then that duck somehow got injected with weird DNA altering nanobots and it started changing and its webbed feet and wings turned into hooves, and it turned pink and grew a curly tail and started snorting, no longer liked swimming but instead loved wallowing in the mud..  you wouldn’t say “hey look at that pink duck!”  You’d have to admit that you now have a pig.  So....  bitcoin was a duck, it got injected with DNA altering nanobots and started turning into a pig, and the duck lovers said “no!!!”, cloned it and gave the clone another injection that killed the nanobots, and it turned back into a duck.  BTC stayed a pig (not matching the bitcoin description, therefore not bitcoin), and BCH is still the original duck (is bitcoin).;3;0;False;patrick99e99;ds4ua3x;Nine years ago on Jan 3 2009, the genesis block was mined.

Don't use terms you have no idea about. A store of value is something that has a stable price, doesn't do 30% swings on a day. It's obvious in the name, it stores value. Something that you buy to make you rich in no time is called a speculative asset. If this asset doesn't actually do what it promises like bitcoin core, than it becomes a ponzi scheme.

"**Gavin Andresen**

Gavin Andresen (born Gavin Bell) is an American software developer known for his involvement with Bitcoin. He is based in Amherst, Massachusetts.

Originally a developer of 3D graphics and virtual reality software, he became involved in developing products for the Bitcoin market in 2010, and declared himself the Lead Developer of the reference implementation for Bitcoin client software after Satoshi Nakamoto had announced his departure. In 2012 he founded the Bitcoin Foundation to support and nurture the development of the Bitcoin currency, and by 2014 left his software development role to concentrate on his work with the Foundation.

"I am doing it. I write content for steemit and yours.org and I get Bitcoin Cash that way. I tip people Bitcoin Cash here (hey /u/rawb0t when will the bot be back?) and I have people here in my local city that I send Bitcoin Cash as payment for services and goods (like computer related stuff). I also send Bitcoin Cash to my family to support them. And I send some to my friends to get them interested in Bitcoin Cash. Some have downloaded a client and gave me an address allowing me to cheaply and fast send them some Bitcoin Cash.

So yeah there are lots of people using Bitcoin for what it was intended. THis number will grow slowly and eventually when people see all the benefits that is has over using banks or paypal or visa cards you will see more and more growth untill the ecosystem is big enough that you never need fiat anymore because you can work and live within the bitcoin cash system. Or maybe there will be another crypto that does even better, then I will use that one.  Bitcoin is simply another name for crypto currency. Every crypto is made possible by the mechanisms that Sasothi invented. He invented the engine, but his first version was the steam engine. Now people will make gasoline engines or gas powered engines .. .etc etc etc. 

Eventually I will get more money for [my music](https://soundcloud.com/matthijsbos) and for [my video content](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG9Ijssr0Kc) because my users can pay or tip or support me direcly without needing advertisers.

"> The idea was abandoned, ironically, when Mr Paulson decided to follow Britain’s plan of injecting cash directly into troubled banks.

For those not familiar with the history, the [US Federal Reserve](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WALCL) still hasn't unwound the factor of 5 increase of their assets from that time.

The FED has an [EDIT nearly] unlimited ability to add to its assets.  As the central bank, most US banks have accounts at the FED, which are used to settle daily transactions between the banks, and where they can deposit excess funds and borrow for short periods of time when they need it.  The interest rate for borrowing from the FED is known as the ""Federal Funds Rate"", and is closely followed in the news.

When the FED wants to add to it's assets, it buys treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities from member banks and credits those bank's accounts at the FED to pay for it.  It now has more assets - the securities it bought, and more liabilities - the account balances of member banks.  So their books balance, but nobody can stop the FED from leveraging their net assets an unlimited amount.  Last time I looked, they were leveraged 200:1.

The effect on member banks is they now have more ""reserves"", since cash balances at the FED count as reserves.  Therefore they can lend more to customers, since they are required to keep a certain percentage reserve ratio.  It also increases the market value of the securities the FED bought, because it increased demand and reduced supply.  So the banks' books look healthier.

To the extent the FED bought mortgage-backed securities which were backed by crappy loans and over-valued real estate, it also cleaned up the member banks' books.  The FED can't go bankrupt, and can afford to be patient until those bad loans eventually are paid off by foreclosures and interest on the good loans.  Something like 5% of loans were [non-performing or written off](https://ezine.weissratings.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/874646.png) at the worst point, which means 95% were still paying.  But banks have to mark down the securities backed by those bad loans severely, making their assets vs liabilities look very bad.  The FED carries those securities at face value, regardless of the market for them, so their books look artificially good.";15;3;False;danielravennest;ds4i1zo;Nine years ago on Jan 3 2009, the genesis block was mined.
