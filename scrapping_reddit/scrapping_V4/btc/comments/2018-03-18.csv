It's not their fault, it's when stop-losses trigger. If someone has big caps and have a good timing it's totally possible. Let's say a group of people have a set of stop loss for 8k, 7k, 6k and so on, when someone sell a massive amount of btc, it causes the market to go down for a few seconds and in the meantime stop losses will trigger at each price level and magnify the effect. It can go all the way down to 1k in this case (depends on stop loss levels).
