I had to correct some colleagues on buying Bitcoin Cash. They were like yea I own Bitcoin... they showed me their wallet and it had Bitcoin Cash on it. I announced to the office that Bitcoin cash was NOT Bitcoin. Bitcoin is labeled BTC.. and doesn’t have ANY words after its name. They all let out a sigh and sold it for the real Bitcoin...🤗 They all promised to tell everyone not to buy the wrong one.... don’t want to get scammed. Oh and I reminded them that the reddit BTC isn’t a real Bitcoin thread. So deceiving, if Bitcoin was so legit why do they have to steal the Bitcoin name on everything? Reddit - btc and bitcoin . com.

I’m not trolling i’m new to the Bitcoin thing but I was told Bitcoin Cash is not bitcoin just another alternative.  So i found the btc thread on Reddit and was just confused on why everyone called it bitcoin cash is all.. cause on Coinbase there is Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash why isn’t there just Bitcoin? So a friend just told me about how Bitcoin cash is a scam or something off of the real Bitcoin. Just weird to have people talking about Bitcoin Cash on a Reddit thread labeled /btc when bitcoin cash is actually labeled/bch. Come on man you can’t tell me that isn’t deceiving? ;2;0;False;Crypto-Cronie;dv9rlk5;Paid a beer using Bitcoin Cash in Paris, adoption is real!;81r2p3;https://i.redd.it/81tz8c33qkj01.jpg

"I have a few thoughts in response to this comment.

First, it contradicts itself. Let's censor this guy because he likes censorship? That just doesn't sit well with me.

Second, bch is permissionless by design (and that's a good thing). We couldn't keep him away if we wanted to (and if we tried he could just make a new account and we'd never know).

Third, admitting to your mistakes is one of the hardest things to do. He did that instead of just making a new account. Let's not cast him out for it.

Fourth, obviously he won't get a position of power any time soon. But again, if he wants one he can start from scratch with a new account and have the same chance as anyone else. Not because we want him to, but because we wouldn't know. ";36;2;False;CJYP;dv8xcmu;Cobra-Bitcoin's grief over Bitcoin Cash is finally over;82b1mg;https://i.redd.it/4ryy76wjk1k01.png

First, you still haven't addressed my issue that he can just create an alternate account and we'd never know. We can be known as an inclusive community or an exclusive community, but either way we can't actually keep him out.

Second, thievery is looked down upon in every culture I know of. Whereas there are plenty of cultures that think censorship is ok (China being one example). Much as I dislike censorship, disagree with those cultures, and think we definitely shouldn't become a censored community (and I would leave if we did), censorship isn't as globally frowned upon as thievery. If he's from a culture where censorship is normal, you can't really blame him as a person for being for censorship, when he thinks it's the best thing for bitcoin.

He's not had a come to jesus moment about BCH. He doesn't respect Nakamoto consensus. He doesn't see his attempt to coerce miners, or indeed convince the community to change the poW, as the truly **centralised bitcoin takeover** that he purports to save it from.

So let's focus on bitcointalk.org and on bitcointalk.org. Theymos and Cobra are anonymous, we don't even know what their faces look like. While when people where wondering if Nick Szabo was a real name or a pseudonym at least we had a face.  Sirius is Martti Malmi. Again at least [we have a face.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5i33yqSbUcc) 

So here we have three people that have the keys to the kingdom, so to speak. Theymos, Cobra and Martti Malmi. 
So if I where a dictator I would simply be Theymos and Cobra at the same time, then it's always 2 vs 1. 


And it happens to be *that* Cobra that is slowly tweeting himself in to Bitcoin-BCH territory. 
One should have a look at the time all these Cobra tweets are posted and compare it with /u/Theymos activity on reddit. 

So why are Theymos and Cobra not engaged in some kind of conflict? /r/bitcoin is still heavenly censored. I don't know about bitcointalk.org but most posts there as far as I know are about promoting some coin or ICO. It's been a while since I read any useful posts over at bitcointalk.org


So let's think tactical and figure out what's going on behind the scenes. Why was Theymos okay with allowing Cobra to partly own bitoin.org and bitcointalk.org in the first place? Did Cobra pay any money for it? If so ... why would Cobra risk this investment by tweeting himself in to the BCH camp and risk a conflict with Theymos?

And what is up with the icon of a cobra and the name, what is the symbolism behind it. A forked tongue ... seriously? Does Cobra think that all of us are as naive as those people that bought physical chuck e cheese coins thinking they where buying bitcoins? 

If Cobra was stupid enough in November to tweet all these nonsense tweets. And the whole let's change the PoW algo of Bitcoin-BTC. Seriously somebody that naive... you don't want a person like that having any power over those two domain names. So what is going on? Did he recently have brain surgery or something and know suddenly he is not naive anymore?

No I am not buying any of this. if Cobra wants to be taken seriously by the Bitcoin Cash community he will have to reveal his identity and become a public persona. Something that I don't see happening. So that's the end right there.

Can we now forget about Cobra and move on? Let him tweet whatever he wants to tweet. 
He is just a distraction.

"Network fees for any cryptocurrency are based on the *size* of the transaction data, not the amount of crypto being sent.

To say that ""$5 fees sounds like much but it's only $5"" is utterly ridiculous.

BTC fees used to be 1sat/byte. Now they are much higher. The increased $ value of BTC is irrelevant because users are still paying WAY TOO MUCH FOR FEES

1 sat/byte is all a transaction is worth. Some would argue a transaction is worth less than that (1 sat/tx)";3;0;False;maff1989;dvagmzp;Bitpay has integrated Bitcoin Cash, screenshot confirmation;82hvob;https://i.redd.it/w3jn709347k01.png
