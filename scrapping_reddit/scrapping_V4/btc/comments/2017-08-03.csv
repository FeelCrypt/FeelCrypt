"I'm not referring to ETH. Like our friends at the SEC say it's different in purpose. 

Too deep a topic to go in-depth here but IMO BTC's own example is what most threatens to invalidate its position, while the best alt projects have worked to solve its issues in their forks. Two examples:

(1) Governance: Decred, PIVX, and others creating advanced decentralized governance to  prevent BTC's toxic politics. 

(2) Proof of Work. BTC's energy use is irresponsible now. It will be dangerously, perhaps fatally so with planned mainstream adoption. Both in carbon footprint and as a national security concern for grids with mines of that scale. Alts have solved this with Proof of Stake and other working models, BTC is way way behind here.

Agreed on how dangerous the fork is. Guess now that it's here it remains to be seen if the public is smart enough to get crypto as a thing, or if the take away will be simply BTC's an unstable store of value, and it all goes poof.";1;1;False;zetathta;dl4a3j2;478559 (BCH) was mined!;6qy4df;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6qy4df/478559_bch_was_mined/

"You need to stop thinking about physical coins or objects. Bitcoins don't actually exist.

A bitcoin is simply an unspent output to a previous transaction that you have the private key allowing you to use it as an input to a further transaction. 

A wallet is simply a storage mechanism for that Private Key.  

When there is a fork, you simply use your private key to sign a transaction on one chain to send those 'coins'.  You can then use that same private key to send a different transaction on the other chain.

It may be profitable to attack a smaller chain if you can get someone to pay for your time. Say, you go and start selling transaction reversals via 51% attack.

"Market acceptance drives the demand which leads to price discovery.  Then mining difficulty adjusts until marginal cost of mining reaches price.

With traditional commodities like gold or oil the selling price fluctuates, but over the long term it aligns with the cost of production (or mining).

"The bitcoin paper provides this consensus mechanism so that everyone outside of the network doesn't have to. The purpose being that everybody should be able to receive and send bitcoins without ever having to worry if blocks are being produced which aren't in consensus. 

Is it BCC? Is it BCH? Is it Bcash? Is it Bitcoin? Guys how do I send my Bitcoin Cash and not my Bitcoin? Guys what do I need to do to prepare for this? Why does my exchange not even allow deposits during this period?

Every single stupid question above could have been avoided if not for Bitcoin Cash explicitly ensuring their survival regardless of difficulty, regardless of hashrate, and regardless of being the longest chain or not. 

If Bitcoin Cash was a real fork, it would have went like this: ""We just produced a 2MB block guys! We forked! But now most of the nodes and miners are rejecting our block because it wasn't in consensus and now their is a longer chain that doesn't include our 2MB block. Our chain is now dead because no one is mining our shorter chain and the difficulty is high."" Does anyone lose bitcoins here? Nope. That was by design. The entire bitcoin network could have kept smooth sailing if it was done this way.

Instead, an altcoin was created and they sadly put Bitcoin in the name and airdropped them at a 1:1 ratios to bitcoin holders based on a snapshot of the blockchain. Are CPUs voting on them? Nope.

"Gavin

You can call whatever coin you want Bitcoin.  You can wait for Bitcoin Cash to be the most work Sha256 chain and then call it Bitcoin if you like.  I doubt many people have a problem with that.

However, currently Bitcoin Cash is not the most work chain, yet it still exists.  If Bitcoin Cash becomes the most work chain, the original rules Core coin will still exist.

This illustrates why the BitcoinXT, Bitcoin Classic, BU and SegWit2x proposals are irresponsible. Unlike Bitcoin Cash, they do not have replay protection (and with the exception of SegWit2x they do not have wipeout protection).  Therefore, if one of those coins launch, we could have chaos and confusion with exchanges and users being replayed and losing money, it could be a total mess.  Please can you finally stop supporting these contentious hardforks which do not have these safety mechanisms?  If there is any significant opposition to the hardfork, we need these safety mechanisms.  This is what people have been saying for years, they are not against bigger blocks.

"> Definetly was a great programmer

Great disagreement here. It's a monolithic program instead of the modularity the functions it serves would call for (wallet vs. validating node vs miner), it's done in a wholly inadequate language, and it's got quirks that for a long time nobody dared touch due to how fragile and non-compliant-with-what-the-code-said was (like the DB bug that caused the fork way back when it was attempted to be upgraded). IIRC up until not too long ago it also had some pretty rigid, version-dependent dependencies in order to compile.

It was well debugged, and throughout the years the code has been attempted to be cleaned up, but it will take a from-the-ground-up reimplementation (like the parity guys are attempting) in order for it to be able to be called truly elegant, solid, and efficient software.

No, I am not a network engineer. I am merely explaining my interpretation of the benefits of a decentralized client ecosystem. What are your arguments against having multiple co-operating clients that operate the network? If there were to be a programing flaw found in a monolithic client implementation, all nodes would be effected simultaneously, impacting the whole network. Whereas in a diverse client ecosystem, only a subset of the network would be effected, allowing other nodes to continue unaffected. This would allow the network to continue until the flawed implementation is patched, and would encourage client developers to have rigorously secure code, to protect their market share more than a monopoly on the client implementation. ;9;2;False;Dahaz159;dl3mgqs;Bitcoin Cash infographic.

Ada is a structured, statically typed, imperative, wide-spectrum, and object-oriented high-level computer programming language, extended from Pascal and other languages. It has built-in language support for design-by-contract, extremely strong typing, explicit concurrency, offering tasks, synchronous message passing, protected objects, and non-determinism. Ada improves code safety and maintainability by using the compiler to find errors in favor of runtime errors. Ada is an international standard; the current version (known as Ada 2012) is defined by ISO/IEC 8652:2012.

"**Fail-fast**

In systems design, a fail-fast system is one which immediately reports at its interface any condition that is likely to indicate a failure. Fail-fast systems are usually designed to stop normal operation rather than attempt to continue a possibly flawed process. Such designs often check the system's state at several points in an operation, so any failures can be detected early. A fail-fast module passes the responsibility for handling errors, but not detecting them, to the next-highest level of the system.

We are making up modules here that don't exist or didn't exist at the time. Bitcoin core is a full node, in the original design a non mining full node was not planned. Of course a full node contains a wallet, a ""relay"" node was never planned (it's not a feature, it's a side effect).
Also note that these features are indeed seperate at the code level, they are just packaged as a single thing. (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/0.8/src/walletdb.cpp for example contains the wallet, while p2p code lives in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/0.8/src/net.cpp )

Most shops are not going to make you wait around for ages, or they will just refuse to accept RBF.

Or, the most likely scenario is that (sometimes) they don't realise you're doing it.

Buy 10 items for $100, RBF them all. Probability of getting 1 of them back is pretty decent (do 20 items if 10 isn't enough). Do it daily and that's $100 of items a day (that you can resell on ebay, pawn it in a brick and mortar shop, or anywhere else).

You don't even need to buy 10 items, just go into a shop and try RBF, if they refuse, say ""ok"" and walk out and try the next shop. Or do the same method online.

C++ has a lot of undefined behaviour and is notorious for behaving differently in different environments, even the same code compiled by different compilers can behave differently. This is a risk factor when you have many nodes which need to behave identically. C++ is great for some things, but it wouldn't be my first choice for Bitcoin. I can think of a few other languages which might be more appropriate. Go and Erlang are both great for networking systems. Rust is great for memory safety and eliminating undefined behaviour.

A lot of misinformation here. **SegWit does not remove signature data from transactions.** SegWit creates a bigger block, and in the bigger block all transactions contain signatures. Transactions without signatures continue to be invalid and signatures continue to be committed in blocks. SegWit allows partial validators who do not check signature validity to do so without downloading the signatures themselves. This does not make invalid transactions valid. It does not make invalid blocks valid. It does not make invalid signatures valid. It does not make transactions without signatures valid. It does not remove signatures from blocks, as all block content continues to be committed in the block header. **SegWit simply lets you verify non-witness transaction data without downloading (then discarding) the witnesses, which solves the problem of light clients having to download things they don’t care about.**;3;0;False;burstup;dl43t14;Bitcoin Cash infographic.

First of all, you can still send a normal bitcoin transaction with Segwit enabled if you want to, it's just that Segwit transactions use less block space and are therefore cheaper. Second the Segwit signatures aren't dropped, they are verified and then hashed into one signature on the blockchain. This makes Bitcoin leaner and meaner as half of the data no longer needs to be stored long term by every node. Segwit also enables new kinds of signatures called Schnorr signatures which reduce the cost of transactions that move many inputs into one large output, a common problem for businesses. Because of this Schnorr makes it much more expensive to spam the blockchain. There are also a bunch of other big improvements, all designed to optimize the existing block space and resources. Bitcoin Cash has none of these things.;5;1;False;biglambda;dl3om8l;Bitcoin Cash infographic. A simple explanation of the changes made by the hard fork.;6r9y3p;https://i.imgur.com/uJ9XE06.png

Yes, that is correct. The Segwit2X proposal currently supported by the mining majority intends to hardfork to a 2MB blocksize capacity 3 months after the activation of SegWit.

Some potential downsides of Bitcoin cash could result from the increased rate of blockchain storage size growth. This will make it more difficult to load full nodes into the future. Bitcoin cash also has a reduced developmental focus on off-chain transactions. This may slow the advance of payment channel technology, which allows for micropayment features. However, this technology is likely to emerge on Bitcoin cash eventually, but will not be as necessary as it would be on Bitcoin (Segwit)'s 1MB blocksize chain. ;4;0;False;Dahaz159;dl3w338;Bitcoin Cash infographic.

"The ability to process 8x the transactions means there won't be a backlog.  A transaction will very likely confirm with the next block.  This is how bitcoin worked back before 2015.

The backlog created the higher transaction fees, and because you could not predict the fee needed to get into the next block you had to overpay.  To solve that problem Core created Replace By Fee, which let you write a transaction with a low fee then later resubmit it with a higher fee to get it processed quicly.  Presumably the only change would be indicating a higher fee, but it could also just not pay the merchant at all.

I equate it to using a pencil to write a check to the merchant, then rewriting it later.  (For those in locations that, luckily, don't use them, a check is a piece of paper with an IOU that the merchant could take to the bank to receive payment).";2;0;False;rowdy_beaver;dl3zg40;Bitcoin Cash infographic.

The bitcoin cash chain has only been in existence for a few days. Once it has been settled, and exchanges are able to process deposits and withdrawals normally, it's price will likely promote new mining power to join the network. Many miners may choose to support bitcoin cash fully in the future, if the planned 2MB hardfork fails to occur. Ultimately its support by miners will depend on market demand for bitcoin cash, which I believe is more significant than you may be giving credit for. ;1;1;False;Dahaz159;dl3ya9t;Bitcoin Cash infographic.

With bitcoin cash, you will be able to make a transaction, and have it be visible as a ZeroConf transaction within seconds. At this point it will be included in the next block and confirmed within 10 minutes. However, bitcoin cash removes the replace by fee mechanism. This makes it more secure for vendors to accept a transaction without waiting for it to be confirmed and placed into a block, as they can be confident that it will be confirmed shortly without being modified. ;5;1;False;Dahaz159;dl3ylh8;Bitcoin Cash infographic.

Increasing block size is a vitally necessary change for bitcoin, as it is constantly at maximum capacity, making longer transaction times and higher fees. Full nodes are able to handle larger block sizes without any problems, and storage space costs are an insignificant barrier to adoption when compared with transaction fees exceeding $3 at the peak of the backlog a few weeks ago. Bitcoin cash provides this much needed block size boost, allowing more people to use on-chain transactions at a lower price. ;2;1;False;Dahaz159;dl3wo3p;Bitcoin Cash infographic.

"Valid but some also feel that the direction Bitcoin is heading in is damaging the BitCoin name. The crash is inevitable btw, do not trust any values these first week or two at all. It's still too new ground.

I do not care which chain lives or dies but I would like to support whatever chain supports cash transactions and not just larger stores of wealth if possible. I do not personally hate things like SegWit if good technical reasons can be given for it and it is tried and tested. The 8MB block increase is obviously very good. I see a future maybe. I hope it really crashes and I might even buy in a tiny bit (I do not hold any BTC, used it for transactions for years tho).

BCH is not a thread to BTC though. Either it dies, it's a side chain or it ends up representing the will of the vast majority of users and becomes the defect bitcoin. This is still new technology. I am not even sure bitcoin is even the coin of the future and not the technical testbed and predecessor to whatever currency will come out in a few decades time.

"Agree with some of this.  

I shouldn't have to preface this but I will; I'm running a BCH full node and can 100% see the hand of /r/Bitcoin behind the ""bcash"" attempted rebranding. Their sticky just after the fork just felt so wrong - all the talk of alts and ""this is off topic"" was just plain creepy.  

That said, I think the _Bitcoin Cash_ brand/naming was a bit of a mistake. Public uptake is a big deal and I can see it being confusing as hell. The surge in mistaken purchases before the fork of _BitconnectCoin_ is testament to that.  

What does _Cash_ add to the name? I guess I can see that it identifies _Bitcoin Cash_ as a transactional crypto rather than ""SWIFT on blockchain"" but anyone who understands what that means and the history behind it already knows what they are doing.  

For the public, it is a simple noun and carries nothing more than _coin_ or _digital_ or _block_ does.  

Should have just gone like _BitcoinPlus_ or  something (I'm sure there are better examples out there). Of course there was a lot of work and discussion behind all this that I'm missing, just at face value seems a little rushed.

"/triggered!!

It's completely natural for human beings to shorten names for use in casual conversation and social interactions. 

With Bitcoin Cash, everyone I've spoken or listened to uses BCC, BCH, Bcash, or Bitcash during casual conversation.

I have no idea what the bcash sub is all about, but they certainly didn't come up with that name by themselves -- wasn't it Bitfinex who first described their BCH as ""Bcash""?

Whatever the case, trying to stop the natural use of all these nicknames is hilariously futile. I suspect you'll likely run into a little Streisand Effect along the way if you push back against this too much.

"Hey man no need for the apology. 0-conf is just short for 0 confirmations. Bitcoin and Bcash have miners that add blocks to the blockchain which are filled with transactions. A transaction is sent and will show up in the receivers wallet immediately but is not considered to be truly/safely sent or confirmed until a miner adds a block to the blockchain with your transaction in it. We call this settlement on the blockchain.

Visa does the same thing. The transaction goes immediately but it says pending in your cc account. Then a few days later the transaction is confirmed by a third party and the transaction is added to your bill. Visa confirms transactions in around 3 days. Bitcoin in around 10 minutes. And Bcash in around 45 min- hour (but is getting faster every day as the difficulty increases and hash rate goes up )";3;2;False;the_zukk;dl4ks9p;I made few transaction on Bitcoin Cash.

basic idea, a miner can provably show what he is working on by publishing the hash with the greatest proof of work he has found so far + the block that it is relevant to and this can done at any time.

"You are describing the situation as it is today. What about in a couple years when there are many more users? Small blocks can only fit so many on-chain transactions. The rest of the transactions have to go off-chain or switch to a different coin. BCH allows more on-chain transactions. 

Unlike many people in this debate, I am unsure whether on- or off-chain scaling is better. With BCH we now have a real world experiment that will show which is better.

"> We still need faster blocks eventually, 


not convinced about this, is 10min perfect probably not, I don't feel it is pressing though, are you familiar with Peter R's Subchains, I feel this addresses many issues with need for faster confirmation and variation in block arrival time see below. open to possibilities though.


> smaller and faster block [1min] is better than large and long [10min]. As it allow you to avoid large burst of verification (could improved with thin blocks though), when new block is found.


As you pointed out this is a non issue as Miner / Node has already verified each transaction already when it first received it, so verification is spread evenly over block time period. implemented recently with xthin/compact blocks.


> Also make variation less problem when you actually need confirmation but would like avoid wait 2hrs+ due variation


if the majority (sampled) of miners can PROVE that your transaction is in the block that they are currently working on, that goes a long way to mitigating this issue imo.


as to Zero-Conf it's all about risk management, add 1% onto your coffee prices for the 1% of double spends (exaggerated) , too low increase, too high decrease. simples.

There's a small intrinsic cost to processing extra transactions, both in a small amount of power use, but mostly because it takes a little time, during which you can in theory be beaten by another miner.

Gawd I've missed that feeling. Since fees went bonkers on the old chain I've avoided transfers between my own wallets and had to optimize my fees based on when I needed confirmation. I'm obviously not the only one. Before I used to not even care because I could micro tip and still pay nearly nothing in fees.;24;2;False;ohHeyRightOn;dl3yjvj;I made few transaction on Bitcoin Cash.

"Was this big BCH fiasco worth getting a 15 minute trade? LTC and ETH can already do that or better. BTC is valuable because it is ""digital gold"": the most secure, time tested, largest hashpower, and yes- slower than ETH/LTC/BCH. ETH and BTC complement each other. I don't see where BCH fits in.";-15;4;False;DetrART;dl40loa;I made few transaction on Bitcoin Cash. It refreshingly feels like Bitcoin used to!

Delusion is strong here, since the spam attacks stopped you can get into any block on the bitcoin network for pennies. Also worth mentioning that the bitcoin blockchain is used by thousands of businesses while no one uses the bcash chain, no wonder you don't have to fight to get into blocks. ;-2;1;False;aeroFurious;dl43eqk;I made few transaction on Bitcoin Cash.

"Dude. We just went over this. You can't seriously repeat that SegWit-with-witnesses is 30kb and SegWit-without-witness is 750kb unless you are comparing optimized (compact blocks) transfer with  non-optimized transfer which is plain silly.

Again, they cannot use a bloom filter because they would need to trust their peers. They can mine without validating as the only trust it requires is an attacker not wasting $30k. Do you see that difference?

Where or when did I give flextrans a pass?";2;0;False;tomtomtom7;dl325ka;"Holy shit!
