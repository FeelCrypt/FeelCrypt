">  it will be the same as btc and won't be able to count on being in the next block, correct?

The problem with BTC started to happen when blocks were ~80% full.  Due to variance in finding blocks, and rate of new transactions appearing, you started to see significant mem pool backlog and fee increases.

BCH currently allows 8 MB blocks, and the 80% point is 6.4 MB/block on average.  We are a good way from needing that.

No, it’s a product of large blocks. Once the 8 MB blocks of Bitcoin Cash fill up, BCH will be handling more txs than PayPal, so it will be *huge*. And then we’ll increase blocks to 16 MB.

Bitcoin Cash has an 8MB blocksize limit currently, compared to Bitcoin's 1MB blocksize limit.

"**Greater fool theory**

The greater fool theory states that the price of an object is determined not by its intrinsic value, but rather by irrational beliefs and expectations of market participants. A price can be justified by a rational buyer under the belief that another party is willing to pay an even higher price. In other words, one may pay a price that seems ""foolishly"" high because one may rationally have the expectation that the item can be resold to a ""greater fool"" later.

Fee estimation is pretty bad in most wallets, and this is the main culprit in rising fees.  People don't realize they can go lower, so they just do what the app says.  This causes fee estimation software to continually increase fees for everyone.  But the reality is that you can undercut the recommended fee a lot and still get your tx confirmed pretty easily.

"It means that the converse statement is true: using non Segwit transactions is 75% more expensive.

Besides, the ""moon moment"" of mass adoption can only take place on a chain with high tx capacity. Segwit/LN doesn't achieve meaningful scaling of the network, mainly due to the high failure rate of successfully routing a LN tx... Have you ever read their white paper or seen any of their presentations? The idea is hairbrain and asinine in every sense. The design requires users to share timelock keys and store passwords (huge ux burden) and even moreso, implicates users in a ridiculous rob-peter-to-pay-paul system of paying money forward as a way to route money for the system architecture.

Imagine you have ""fake buys"" under control somewhere and you can long 10k bitcoins at $1k and sell them at $10k each with 10x margin, 100x margin? Guaranteed money out of nowhere. All you have to do is sell the fake tethers a bit above the market.

Similarly, bitcoin can be broken down into smaller percentages, which are then worth less than an entire bitcoin, much like smaller denominations of currency such as pennies and cents.

"On BCH split and BTG split BTC price immediately dropped. It didn't take long to recover and head back to new highs. But it did drop initially.

It's important to note that BCH and BTG were valued far lower from the get go. By contrast BT2 is trading at $1000. It's not too far fetched to see $1k suddenly get shaved off the price of BTC at time of fork.

What happens after that is anybodies guess. But I'm not so sure it just repeated the pattern we saw with BTG and BCH. Those were clear minority hard forks. B2X is more legitimized and will likley be a majority hard fork. It'll be interesting to see how the market reacts to this changing circumstance.

There are basically few problems:  more than 450 million USDT are issued from the start of the year, the company who creates USDT does not exchange USDT into USD, so basically it's just a token that can be traded on exchanges, but you can never cash it out in USD, but only exchange it for other crypto.  You have to trust the company that they really received USD before they issue USDT, and that they didn't create new USDT from nothing.... USDT is most heavily used on an exchange which has questionable reputation - Bitfinex..

"Good point, but botnets can be fought, and its easy to detect an abnormal CPU usage.  Hopefully it will be an additional incentive for programmers to make their programs more secure.

In the long run you wont be able to easily resell your used mining hardware.  Yes, back in the day where GPU mining was a thing you did not have to mine much to be profitable, and thus your GPU was not that used and could be sold at a decent price.  But over the years mining margins are supposed decrease down to a point where competition is so rude that hardware must be used almost up to the breaking point before being profitable.  We are not there, but in the long run we should.

Now that I think of it, such GPU/CPU mining scheme probably cannot exist in practice: CPUs/GPUs are just too complex and some day or another optimizations will be found and mining will become ""professionalized"" once again.  So I guess I was wrong and the mining scheme does not really makes such a difference.

"Bitcoin was getting adopted by mechants for payment at a great rate before the fees skyrocketed when the 1mb limit was reached., Then it all collapsed which left a sour taste in late adopter's mouths. Alts were not known or trusted by the general public.

The infrastructure and streamlining to allow the average joe easier adoption was making good headway right when the early adopters were asking stores to accept BTC, then it all collapsed to store of wealth system, care of blockedupcore. It essentially set the whole growth and adoption back to the first days. Because it takes great time to gain general public trust and knowledge of the tech. BTC was far ahead and lost it all to alts that are slowly gaining but they are basically starting from scratch on general public trust.

Yes, agree the tech is clunky and confusing for the average joe. BTC was gaining on both those fronts, and then essentially gave up that potential.

I never said BTC would be competing with credit/debt cards right now, but it would probably be competing with apple/android pay, which while still small are growing in adoption by leaps and bounds with millennials.

As for ecoins, everyone is waiting to see what will be the next leader in adoption as it looks like BTC legacy looks to be slowly getting replaced as it's share of the pie is dwindling.

"Some vocabulary: A replay attack can occur when your data is valid on two or more networks. If you use network A to send some crypto to your friend Charles and that same transaction would be valid without needing to change it in any way on network B, you can be the subject of a replay attack, where a third party takes a copy of your transaction on A and rebroadcasts it to network B.

This was a concern at the BCH fork because BCH expected to be a minority chain for a non-zero amount of time and wanted to reassure its users that using their coins would not open them up to losses on the BTC network (and vice versa). In order to prevent replay attacks, BCH changed the format that is accepted as valid for transactions, making any software written for BTC incompatible with BCH.

Because S2X is intended to be an  upgrade to the BTC network, they have not implemented replay protection. S2X expects to be **the** BTC network on fork day and expects that the 1MB chain will be completely deprecated, making replays irrelevant.

And by saying it would be committed months after Segwit went live, allowed them to backtrack on 2x (as we all said they would!). They already got what they want (Segwit1). As predicted, they then attacked 2x as some rouge change that hurts Bitcoin. The ONLY difference is the block size increase... How the heck is that a problem in comparison to Segwit itself?

"At the same time, theres this perception that LN will be regularly used by two individuals. In reality, exchanges, wallets, and other larger entities will establish LN channels between each other. The transactions you do within those exchanges will be settled between each other via those same large payment channels, much like how todays banks work without the 3-5 business day delay. Think Bittrex <-> GDAX, not Sally to John. 

The fundamental problem with this is in Bitcoins quest to become a store of value. It’s fairly obvious that the protocol itself, as a payment method, is dead in the water. Gold is stored in vaults, protected because people need to know it’s secure in the case the world economy collapses. The gold holder can physically verify that they are “secure” in the case currencies collapse by simply seeing or touching gold. Gold is always gold even when broken down to its smallest form. If you don’t actually control the storage / movement of “your” Bitcoin, are you truly in a position to use IT if some shit goes down? With LN, no.

Here's your attempt to label people hypocritical for praising miners for mining BCH and yet complain when they mine Segwit1X.

You are correct that if miners mine Segwit1X they are breaking the NYA by going against the 2Mb upgrade but they certainly aren't breaking the agreement by mining BCH. BCH forked before the NYA was implemented and is a completely separate coin. If miners want to mine another coin other than BTC they have ever right. Therefore your attempt to call people out for being hypocritical is plain wrong.

"LN would in theory allow bitcoin to scale and reach a wide audience. However, certain transactions would still need to be settled on chain. This is an attempt to keep the blockchain modestly small, fees the same (if we scaled with big blocks vs small blocks + off chain), allow instant transactions, and keep bitcoin decentralized. The bad part is that we don't know how off chain transactions will work and if they can be as useful as on chain. The bad part about using big blocks is that nodes SHOULD become very expensive and not for home use, no instant transactions, super large blocks will have a hard time propagating through the network (we don't know how this will play out), and possibly less decentralization since poor countries shouldn't be able to afford running full nodes... 

Basically less tx on chain = higher fees per tx vs way more tx on chain = way less in fees. If you had to pay $100 up front to perform 1000 tx or pay $.1 for each 1000 tx you needed to make would you care? The better option may possibly be the $.1 but that does come at a cost to the network. Additionally there may be ways in which the upfront fees to get on LN are subsidized if someone poor cannot afford the $100 for example.

This thinking is incorrect. Segregation does compact your notion of block. But at the end you still need block + signatures for it to have any meaning. So you will always need to transfer everything block + signatures.
So now you get transactions that actually take up more space, since a transaction will always include the reference to the signature data vs just having the full data on the so called block.

It is not the smarter choice at all, it is a last resort hack. SegWit transactions are not more compact. Unless you do not count the witness part, which does not make sense. SegWit TX need more bytes per transaction in total. Even Luke-jr recommends not using SegWit for normal transactions, only for 2nd layer.

If sides aren't properly supported it puts long-term risk on the security of the minority hash chain.

Surprisingly it increasingly seems 2x isn't going to be supported, well, at least from what I see..  If this is the case miners should fully support Bitcoin (cash), as compromise isn't in the vocabulary of Core, and as a result a crippled coin is going to be the norm.

If miners happen to choose the short-term over the medium to long term on the next split, to be honest, I'll be a bit disillusioned.
