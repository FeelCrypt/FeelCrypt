We're making Bitcoin enormously better money, able to compete with WU, in exchange for slightly larger hard-drives on miner computers. We're still digital gold, and quite evolved if I might say.

"[I am the guy who actually created the original WU vs. Bitcoin image over in r/bitcoin.](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2n23n2/reasons_to_be_cheerful_western_union_removing_wu/)  

As well as being a graphic designer and branding bod, I'm also a computer programmer (for 33 years now) and have built websites that have had to scale to millions of users.  I discovered bitcoin within the first month of its release through HN, integrated it into a non-profit website before bitpay and others arrived on the scene, and have been working my arse off for the last 5 years promoting bitcoin and working with old school establishments that were initially skeptical / fearful.

I've authored about 20-30 whitepapers on all this.

I don't take sides, I am not left or right, I'm only interested in using computers, internet, bitcoin to help fix the many problems we have on the planet.

There was a time when bitcoin as it stood was great for P2P micropayments but today it now needs to have even bigger aspirations than simply competing with WU/Visa.  

If I was to make this image again, it would be with BitPay and exchanges on the left taking similar middleman fees as WU... and Sidechains on the right with decentralised exchanges and the machine-payable web showing how this technology can evolve into being something even greater than we imagined it could be back when I made the original image.

In the meantime I'm very happy that BCH exists, bitcoin is for everyone and the more open the ecosystem is, the more effectively we will find the optimal solutions.

I explained to him how BIP 148/149 UASFs *THAT HE SUPPORTS* (see the link) are much worse than BCH. They have the same replay vulnerability that he mentions for 2x, only much worse, like scam proportions worse, leading to the loss of all BTC and the death of the UASF fork chain. /u/jonny1000 attempted to cheat users of all their Bitcoins through a complex scam, and now he is raising concerns about other forks.

How did this transformation from a scammer to a seeming white hat security critic occur? I never saw him confess or even apologize for his past crimes. Worse, he has been caught trying to distance himself from his crimes. So, I question his intentions. This guy is no hero, in fact, he's a hypocrite.

"Here it is: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/645jjq/why_i_support_a_uasf/

Then two weeks ago you said:

> I did oppose BIP148. **I support the BIP149 UASF**

You said you supported BIP 149, but there was no BIP 149 at the time you posted the topic, only BIP 148. This is just to note one more indication of dishonesty from you. As I explained in my post, and I will quote:

> That's enough info to label you a scammer. **The most serious vulnerabilities were shared between both BIP 148 and 149, notably the ability for miners to take for themselves all the Bitcoins from the SegWit transactions after replaying them on the main chain.** Even Bitmain's new fork coin is way less vulnerable than your scam coin. They listened to criticism and addressed many issues, whereas the UASFs were total gambles, with the most likely, and default scenario leading to **total loss**. Ironic that the UASFyles' scam (first attempt, called BIP 148) was prevented and its victims saved thanks to a last minute intervention by the same miners, i.e. SegWit2x.

> Edit: Correction: **This vulnerability when exploited in BIP 149 is much more disruptive for BIP 149 users**, because the chain split doesn't happen immediately, unlike in BIP 148. This blinds the victims from the reality that they are using consensus rules which are not supported by a hash rate majority. So, the moment the reality hits them is when miners take for themselves the first SegWit coins, producing the first chain-splitting block and revealing the huge disparity between the hash rate on the two sides of the fork, boosted by the extra mining revenue that the SegWit outputs constitute. It's like a sudden ""aaand it's gone"" moment where **BIP 149 SegWit victims lose all their bitcoins at once, with no chance to react**.

"Segwit is for providing a core functionality for LN to work in the first place. Here is where ""pegged sidechains"" got magically transformed into off-chain transacting:

[0074]
Fortunately, by adopting some additional security assumptions at the expense of the low trust design objective, it is possible to do an initial deployment in a completely permissionless way. Instead of utilizing SPVs, pegged sidechains can be implemented externally by having a trusted federation of mutually distrusting functionaries evaluate the script and accept the script by signing for an ordinary multisignature script. That is, the functionaries act as a protocol adaptor by evaluating the same rules we would have wanted Bitcoin to evaluate, but cannot for lack of script enhancements. Using this we can achieve a “federated peg.”
[0075]
This approach is very similar to the approach of creating a multi-signature off-chain transaction system, but the required server-to-server consensus process is provided by simply observing the blockchains in question. The result is a deterministic, highly-auditable process which simplifies the selection and supervision of functionaries. Because of these similarities, many of the techniques used to improve security and confidence in off-chain payment systems can be employed for federated pegs. For example: functionaries can be geographically diverse, bonded via escrowed coins or expensive-to-create coercion-resistant pseudonymous identities, implemented on remote-attesting tamper-resistant hardware, and so on. For small-scale uses, owners of coins in the system can themselves act as the functionaries, thus avoiding third party trust.

I don't fault them either, and I feel bad for them, but Bitcoin requires people to be sophisticated investors.  They need to do their research.

The thing you're not seeing, assuming that you're actually not supporting Core, is that replay protection is the thing that's absolutely essential to Core's survival.  Without replay protection, their chain will be stuck at ~30k tx/day roughly it can handle, but with 300k tx/day outstanding to fit on-chain.  Even if their miners(just Slush) change the code to only include replay-protected transactions in their blocks, they still won't be able to process anywhere near the volume demanded of the chain.

Meanwhile, replay protection makes upgrading more difficult for every wallet and SPV client.  As it stands now, Armory will be compatible with 2x, just change the node.  SPV clients aren't affected by blocksize and won't be affected.  Breaking those things just to help the Core chain have a marginal chance of survival isn't worth it.

The only way you can have a ""secret patent"" is to keep the proprietary information secret so others don't know it exists.

None of this applies to segwit though since it's open development in the public with many competing implementations. They would not be able to successfully get a patent on it as any alternative implementation could easly get the patent revoked.

">A hard fork is the very definition of changing the fundamentals. You actually break the chain. While the code to add blocksize isn't an issue the procedure is.

I guess there's different views on that. Monero for example does all its upgrades via hard forks and there never were any issues.

It only becomes an issue if there is some influential party that makes it controversial.

If Core had pushed a hard fork to increase blocksize limit in 2013 everyone in the Bitcoin economy + all the miners would have accepted it. It would have been a non-issue.

Now after censorship, smear campaigns and kicking out several veteran Bitcoin devs the community has become so polarized, that it's much harder to find consensus for hard forks. SegWit2x seems like a good attempt though. But even now it seem that Core does everything they can to disrupt it.

"> assuming that you're actually not supporting Core

I think they're a mix of malicious and retarded, so no, definitely not. I can't stand how obnoxiously authoritarian they are. But I don't like to just dogpile them indiscriminately, and while their idea of legal action is retarded, I get their argument (which is: ""you're the one who wants to separate, so you should plug the vulnerability that your separation creates"").

>I don't fault them either, and I feel bad for them, but Bitcoin requires people to be sophisticated investors. They need to do their research.

That's fair enough.

> The thing you're not seeing, assuming that you're actually not supporting Core, is that replay protection is the thing that's absolutely essential to Core's survival. Without replay protection, their chain will be stuck at ~30k tx/day roughly it can handle, but with 300k tx/day outstanding to fit on-chain. Even if their miners(just Slush) change the code to only include replay-protected transactions in their blocks, they still won't be able to process anywhere near the volume demanded of the chain.

Be that as it may, it's still a vulnerability. Replaying transactions counts as a hack in my book. It's sort of like being on a pedestrian crossing and expecting the speeding car not to hit you, just because you are ""in the right."" Core should jump out of the way (implement replay protection) in order to save themselves, but I still think the issue of ""right"" is independent of that.

>Meanwhile, replay protection makes upgrading more difficult for every wallet and SPV client. As it stands now, Armory will be compatible with 2x, just change the node. SPV clients aren't affected by blocksize and won't be affected. Breaking those things just to help the Core chain have a marginal chance of survival isn't worth it. Core can add replay protection when they finally hardfork as they should have years ago.

This is a good point I hadn't considered. Bitcoin Cash did implement it though, with seemingly minimal side effects.

>Core can add replay protection when they finally hardfork as they should have years ago.

I agree that they should have hard forked / made an altcoin since their vision is far removed from what Bitcoin's concept is.

"Gregory Maxwell:

Blockstream does not have any patents, patent applications, provisional patent applications, or anything similar, related to segwit. As is the case for other major protocol features, the Bitcoin developers worked carefully to not create patent complications. Segwit was a large-scale collaboration across the community, which included people who work for Blockstream among its many contributors.

Moreover, because the public disclosure of segwit was more than a year ago, we could not apply for patents now.

In the prior thread where this absurdity was alleged on Reddit I debunked it forcefully. Considering that Rick directly repeated the tortured misinterpretation of our patent pledge from that thread (a pledge which took an approach that was lauded by multiple online groups), I find it hard to believe that he missed these corrections, doubly so in that he provides an incomplete response to them as though he were anticipating a reply, when really he’d already seen the rebuttal and should have known that there was nothing to these claims.

As an executive of Blockstream and one of the contributors to segwit, my straightforward public responses 1) that we do not, have not, will not, and can not apply for patents on segwit, 2) that if had we done so we would have been ethically obligated to disclose it, and 3) that even if we had done so our pledge would have made it available to everyone not engaging in patent aggression (just as the plain language of our pledge states): If others depended upon these responses, it would create a reliance which would preclude enforcement by Blockstream or our successors in interest even if the statements were somehow all untrue–or so the lawyers tell me.

In short, Rick Falkvinge’s allegations are entirely without merit and are supported by nothing more than pure speculation which had already been debunked.

>   I was a representative of Microsoft. I would meet with people from Nokia, Ericsson, AT&T, and many other corporate names you’d recognize instantly, in small groups to negotiate standards going forward.

 >   One thing that was quite clear in these negotiations was that everybody was trying to get as much as possible of their own patent portfolio into the industry standard, while still trying to maintain a façade of arguing purely on technical merits. Some were good at it. Some were not very good at it at all.

>    One of the dead-sure telltale signs of the latter was that somebody would argue that feature X should use mechanism Y (where they had undisclosed patent encumbrance) based on a technical argument that made no sense. When us technical experts in the room pointed out how the argument made no sense, they would repeat that feature X should absolutely use mechanism Y, but now based on a completely new rationale, which didn’t make any sense either.

 >   The real reason they were pushing so hard for mechanism Y, of course, was that they had patents covering mechanism Y and wanted their patented technology to go into the industry standard, but they were unable to make a coherent argument that withstood technical scrutiny for why it was the preferable solution at hand, with or without such encumbrance.

FYI, these published patents were lodged 18 months ago!! That is if this is in line with the American patent system. So, soon after Blockstream was formed, they've been scrambling to lock down every single piece of intellectual property they can get their hands on, and since CORE has been employed since Blockstream was formed, that means EVERY SINGLE PIECE OF IP PRODUCED BY THEM BELONGS TO BLOCKSTREAM TOO, SegWit, Lightning, whatever else they have waiting in the wings. All theirs.

There are no such patents, as has been posted here time and time again, for example [in this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/68vl1x/a_simple_explanation_of_why_its_bad_for/dh1nbcb/). Consider if such patents _did_ exist and the CTO of Blockstream was repeatedly and explicitly claiming otherwise? Would those patents be enforceable? Of course not. That in itself should be evidence enough that no such patents exist, even ignoring the fact that nobody claiming they _do_ exist can produce anything to back up their claims.

"Are you familiar with software patents?

There are very few software patents that aren't ""obvious to practitioners of the art"" where ""practitioners"" means an experienced professional in the field the patent covers rather than ""I have a degree, and I wrote code a few times"" (and mine aren't an exception to that.)

The sad truth is that almost all software patents are likely to be ""reinvented"" over and over again, because anybody that is qualified and seriously tries to solve the same problem will end up coming up with similar or equivalent solutions.

The corollary to that is that developers have two choices:

1. keep up to date about every software patents that may impact their domain, and make sure to code around them. That's a huge expense of time to spend just to read mindlessly boring legalese, can result in inferior, more convoluted code, and exposes you to treble damages for all your effort once you get sued for patent infringement anyway because their interpretation of what their patent covers differs from yours.  
2. ignore other people's patents. never read patents. never ever read patents. write patents of questionable worthiness when your employer twists your arm. get patent issuance bonuses. let lawyers fight about the rest.

I'll let you guess which option employers will always tell you to go with.
