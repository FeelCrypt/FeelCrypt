"> but Fees are low.

They are low now because BSCore has finally convinced enough users/merchants/businesses/developers to abandon Bitcoin and caused transaction rates to regress to [2015 levels](https://blockchain.info/de/charts/n-transactions?timespan=all&daysAverageString=7). That's not ""success"".

> 50 percent loss in market is attributed to it not being the only game in town anymore

The collapse hasn't happened until Bitcoin became unusable, repeatedly, which drove users/merchants/businesses/developers off to elsewhere. Before that long predicted event, it was losing market share to the tune of around 5% per year. This isn't coincidence. The collapse has only happened in the 9th year of Bitcoins 9 year history. It stopped ""being the only game in town"" long ago and that hasn't lead to such a [drastic collapse](https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/#dominance-percentage).

>  If BCH was better, we'd see it take a greater lions share of this 50 percent. It does not.

BCH essentially started to rebuild, last august, what BSCore destroyed for the better part of half a decade. It actually takes time to undo the collossal damage that BSCore did to the entire cryptocurrency market space and regain the trust of those who gave up trying to work with cryptocurrencies and give it another shot. And thanks for that BSCore.

>  I can tell you're predominantly emotionally driven from your posts.

You're damn right I am emotionally driven. I've witnessed the destruction of all promise and everything that made Bitcoin great. Made it feel like the future. Looking at Bitcoin today feels like Tomorrowland (the movie) feels to the protagonist, a future that never was. That's simply utterly unacceptable. You can't look at that experience and remain emotionless. If you do, you simply don't care about cryptocurrencies whatsoever.

BSCore has run Bitcoin into the ground with reckless experiments, meddling and destroying everything that made Bitcoin to what it is today. You can't expect to suck and remain ""on top"" forever. The sins are going to catch up, they're in the process of catching up, and when it tips over, it'll be unbelievably ugly because a horde of brainwashed cult members will suddenly discover they've been in a cult and have been brainwashed.

"Don't listen to me? Are you nuts? Can't you see the clear and irrefutable evidence of failure of Bitcoin under BSCores leadership?

- Periods of extreme unreliability, slowness and skyrocketing fees
- Loss of 50% of the cryptocurrency market share in one year (coinciding with the start of those long predicted unreliability periods)
- Merchant abandonment (you used to be able to pay Steam with Bitcoin to name just one example)
- Nearly 10 years after its introduction Bitcoin has **less** adoption, usability and market share than 5 years after its introduction
- Company abandonment (nobody is trying to build any kind of service on top of bitcoin anymore except LN)
- Continuous brain drain and abandonment of developers and researchers who helped build Bitcoin into what it was 5 years ago
- Totalitarian censorship, narrative control and smear campaigns by those ""entrusted"" to steward Bitcoins communication forums (how you can reconcile that with ""censorship resistant money"" is simply completely beyond me)
- Complete failure of BSCore to reach any kind of compromise (repeatedly) to keep the Bitcoin community together (failure of community stewardship)
- Running reckless experiments with Bitcoins economics in favor of a ""solution"" that's anything but

You don't have to be a genius to see that something is rotten in Bitcoin, rotten to the core. That it's very likely beyond any salvage at this point.
