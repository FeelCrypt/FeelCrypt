"From the link which you apparently didn't read:
In the end, it is important to remember SegWit effectively nullifies AsicBoost completely. However, there are two different versions of this method, one of which is not easily detectable whatsoever. Without SegWit transactions in a block, any AsicBoost trickery will be effectively rejected by the Bitcoin network. However, pools could still mine empty blocks to oppose this scaling solution in its current form, since that has nothing to do with AsicBoost. It is an interesting situation, but it appears ASICBoost technology is no longer a threat.

"Here's my TL;DR history:  I started out supporting Core and small blocks which I saw as a necessity.  I did a lot of math to back this, and eventually the math convinced me unequivocally that bigger blocks were better at least to gigabyte levels.  I began posting about this including detailed arguments for/against and about my change of heart and the math.

I found comments of mine being silently removed all of a sudden, which had never happened before.  I noticed this because they got no votes or few votes either way, and then I manually checked and found them removed.  The breaking point was when I made a comment that I put over an hour into that didn't say anything bad or rude or censorship-worthy and immediately checked and it wasn't there.  It got automodded.  (Reddit hides removed comments from you, you have to check them incognito or logged out to see what other people see).  A few hours later the comment went from 1 vote to 0 votes, and I checked again and it was still gone.  In other words, a moderator of the subreddit read my comment, disliked / downvoted it, and left it removed.

I was pretty pissed then.  Two weeks later I was banned for a nonsense reason and I began to read what was really going on all this time.  It still makes me livid to think about the manipulation that has gone on for so long and irreversibly damaged Bitcoin.  Regardless of everything else, Core's behavior manipulating opinions, lies, shitslinging and attacking everything they don't like disgusts me.  I haven't seen anything approaching the same bad behavior from the BCH community.  Or any other coin really.

"I have been active in the Bitcoin community since 2011. When Theymos posted his infamous [""time for a break""](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3h9cq4/its_time_for_a_break_about_the_recent_mess/) post, the Bitcoin community was still very much using /r/bitcoin as a platform for debate and dialogue and lots of talking had been done about the scaling.

Theymos his message was very clear: ""I dictate this sub, my wish is law"" 

Sometime later I got banned for [this opinion.](https://i.imgur.com/73AwRNl.png) 

What is wrong about saying: Hey, I can't afford to use Bitcoin anymore because the fees are way to high for me. Why don't we make more room in the blocks so all transactions fit in there and there won't be a fee war? 

There is nothing wrong with that opinion. And there was nothing wrong with what I was saying. It's the truth. /r/bitcoin and bitcointalkforum and bitcoin.org, all have been under control of theymos and he abuses that power to make Bitcoin go the way that he wants. And we have seen the disastrous consequences of that. Ethereum was not build on top of Bitcoin, it all splintered in a to a million altcoins, the entire Bitcoin community got splintered up.

Theymos has mainly been responsible for that. He put an iron chokehold on the channels that he controls. Now the community has to get over that, regroup and build a community where this can not happen again, one guy taking control and hijacking the entire project.

"You don't understand Bitcoin Cash's economic design _at all_ sorry.

Assume you are a milk delivery company for a small town.

When block rewards drop due to halvings, if some miners can't make a profit anymore they drop off the network. No problem, the security stays relatively the same because it's still pricey to attack the network or gain a 51% advantage. Fees are not required by the miners to remain profitable until there is very little mining reward left (decades away). But then miners will make revenue by fees from _volume_. I.e. 10s of millions of transactions per day at 1 Satoshi per transaction. You know what the great thing will be though?

>it's just a baby that has been attacked by opposing forces that want to preserve the status quo. of course adoption is limited for now. but the growth trajectory is clear; UP.

You mean more and more people will adopt it? Probably, although I don't know where the ceiling on that is. It's a new thing, which is great, but not only is it going to have to compete against existing and entrenched approaches, but it's going to have to compete against lots of other cryptocurrencies too.  In that context it isn't going to get close to where say the Canadian Dollar is in the context of reserves.

>and when you look at the technical capabilities and the economic fundamentals, BCH could easily become the next world reserve currency

How does it differentiate itself from any other cryptocurrency over that time scale (including ones not launched yet?). I don't disagree that there is potential, I disagree that it's likely at this point from the evidence available.

">I personally think volatility goes out to 2140 following the issuance curve. 

I sort of agree, although there is still a question about how much of the value is utility driven and how much is speculation. The big issue is the classic one when it comes to currency, how do you ensure circulation when the real world value of a currency appreciates.. Why spend it, if not spending it means you will be able to spend more later.

Liquidity is sort of getting better, transaction times are still a problem, adoption is still fairly niche so there are barriers. None are insurmountable, or built in to crypto after all.

It's not stable and it's not widely convertible so not really. About the only thing it ticks the boxes on are that it's free from direct government intervention and that there aren't any capital controls.  There is no chance it'll become a reserve currency any time soon (so.. within the next decade..).

"Even better argument. 

Ultimately, the point is though, that currency is to be spent- that’s the entire philosophy behind it. It is an agreed term that can be used to transfer ownership, regardless of what item the ownership is, even if it’s just money. All of that being said, the ones who view scalability issues and fees as “it was not designed to be a charity” technically, sure you’re correct. I don’t remember reading in the white paper that Bitcoin’s goal is to be a charity. But it wasn’t meant to be held onto for dear life, it was designed to be SPENT just like other things we spend our FIAT on, without the trusted parties inbetween. SN didn’t say “buy bitcoin and hodl foreverzzzz!” or anything of that nature. Sure, you wanna save some of it? Go for it, people do that with Fiat too, however, it is ultimately to be spent. Whether it’s a savings for college, retirement, rainy day, or you just wanna save some money, one way or another you’ll spend it eventually somewhere, or give it away. This was never a money making plan, and again although a $100 fee on a million dollar transfer is a bargain, that’s not the fucking point behind it.

"so here's my take: bitcoin's security relies on hashrate, hashrate is provided by miners for economic incentives, incentives are inflation and fees, inflation is quickly diminishing and was only put in place to avoid pre-mining all coins and get miners on-board, over time more and more incentive will be coming from tx fees.

*there has to be a reasonable fee market and reasonable fee market means that fees go high when demand goes up. without reasonable fee market miners have no economic incentive to provide chain security.*

the promise of keeping the fees as low as possible by bumping block size every time throughput hits the ceiling means destroying the fee market and has one of two conseqences:

- rules about bitcoin inflation will have to be adjusted to keep providing miners with economic incentive
- miners will leave, hashrate will drop and with it - value of the currency/network

so yes, bitcoin was never designed to be a charity. if you want to maintain value of bitcoin through security of the network you have to understand why fees matter.

Think that is the point he is trying to make. 

But yeah I don't agree with that reasoning, to me that seems like a argument for unlimited block size and let miners compeat to keep fees as cheap as possible.";1;2;False;rotkiv42;dxmmawn;The Bitcoin community is so far gone...;8dea7r;https://i.redd.it/6ql1ch8o0vs01.jpg
"> Except he's also right that it wasn't created to be a charity.

How is having low fees ""being a charity""? There is a difference between giving money (charity) and not taking money (totally unnecessary exorbitant fees), low fees have *nothing* to do with the concept of a charity.

Weird, this whole time I thought it was awesome that people with minimal technological access/bank access were able to at least start using BCH on old ass phones, you know, the whole adoption thing. Sure, in the scheme of things, it is still cheaper at a $100 fee to move a million dollars vs through an institution, but wasn’t Satoshi’s original vision so that lower developed, less trustworthy governments wouldn’t need to be relied on for an individual to own their own wealth? Maybe I didn’t read between the lines or something. ;70;3;False;captaindopesauce;dxmekw8;The Bitcoin community is so far gone...;8dea7r;https://i.redd.it/6ql1ch8o0vs01.jpg

"It is strange, but it's unsurprising. I played with it a lot early on, because it was novel and it showed promise, the lack of adoption as an actual currency was the barrier that I figured would remain (and it has) and that would limit utility.  That and the fact it was quite hard to use anyway (The granny test etc..).

So I acquired and shared, swapped, transferred, mined, lost and generally bounced bitcoins all over the place (I never had thousands of them, I think I worked it out at 112 at my 'peak', with a value of less than $10..).  I never thought they'd be worth massive amounts per coin (I was impressed when it went to $1..).  

Now that they are are worth vast sums, it has changed the equation. The existing problems (spending them..) still remains, most people can't do their grocery shopping with bitcoin, and a lot of people wouldn't want to. They have gone from being currency like, through appreciating asset and speculative asset, to essentially stores of wealth to be converted into fiat when the value rises.

The fact that the value has risen so massively has, in my view, reduced both utility and any viable wide scale adoption. The explosion of other cryptocurrencies has offset that a bit, but that has then added in issues of exploitative schemes and fraud.  You can add the confusion created by things like bitcoin cash, and the linkages between cryptocurrencies and their forks too.

The technology is still interesting, and there is still a lot of possibility, but things haven't quite gone how I would have hoped.  Throw in that there are now so many odd, and frankly counter-intuitive applications where block-chains are shoehorned in, and that major banks and financial services providers seem to be creating centralised tokens of their own and even that fades a bit.

It is ironic that they are accusing the people who did most to promote the Bitcoin brand of 'stealing' it for BCH.  In reality, they have stolen our brand for a coin that is drifting further and further from Nakamoto-san's white paper.;64;2;False;cbeaks;dxmfnyb;The Bitcoin community is so far gone...;8dea7r;https://i.redd.it/6ql1ch8o0vs01.jpg
