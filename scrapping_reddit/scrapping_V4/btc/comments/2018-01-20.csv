"Do you actually realize that the price manipulation scenario you are talking about above is being practiced today by the national taxes and the free market anyways??

You can buy the same car cheaper in Portugal than you can buy the same car in Germany or UK.

So if everyone would get the same price, the poor people in Portugal would just not buy the car, because its too expensice...

So they raise the price for the Germans, to be able to lower the price for the other countries.

This is also happening with electricity and internet. It is extreme in the case of electricity.

Eletricity in Venezuela costs 4 cents, in Spain it is 14 cents and in Germany it is 25 cents...

It is the same electricity coming from the same nuclear plants in France (In the case of Spain and Germany).

The problem is even in theory it still doesn’t provide zero fee transactions. You actually need to pay for two transactions. One to open the channel and one to close the channel. It works if you have some sort of recurring payment or micro transactions, but is completely useless for buying a pizza for instance. The other problem is your money is tied up for the duration of the lifetime of a payment channel. Lightning network is really no more than prepaying for something and then getting a refund for what you don’t spend. There are some niche scenarios where I think it’ll be a good thing, but for most payments I think it’s more overhead than what it’s worth.

I don't think this is true, more and more businesses and users are adopting BCH, they are not waiting for LN. Bitpay is supposed to add BCH in a few weeks, that will be another good push.

I believe BTC's (and many altcoins) price rise is caused by Tether and Bitfinex, it's pure speculation, people are not investing in tech or future prospects. Tether has been printing USDT at an increasingly quick pace, now they are at 100M per day. I believe this is unsustainable, and the BTC price is going to crash very soon. Miners might then move to BCH because its DAA will give them better profits.

"If you look at the value of transactions over BTC, you can see that over half are over $2,000USD in value. Only a small amount (10% or so) are for less than $50.

Since LN has liquidity restrictions due to channel funding limits, it is reasonable to presume that it will primarily only be used for small transactions.

This means that perhaps 10% of on-chain transactions will naturally migrate to LN. This isn't irrelevant, but I'm not convinced it will actually cause any appreciable reduction in on-chain volume.

If in fact LN does become useful for small transactions, you may actually expect on-chain transactions to increase as a greater number of people may adopt BTC.

For these reasons, I expect high fees to continue to be a problem. However, the security model of LN relies on the ability to settle transactions to the blockchain in a reliable manner.

"Lightning has to absolutely fail before BCH can take over, meaning its own supporters must begin to admit to themselves that it has failed.

That might not happen for a good while. They are now rolling out Lightning to mainnet and posting about payments. This is likely responsible for current BTC significant price-rise.

They will be able to cast this as a success until Lightning fails to scale, if it fails to scale.

That is expected to happen somewhere between 10,000 nodes and 1 million nodes.

That will take a long time to get to that point. Only once Lightning fails to scale and the congestion problem becomes chronic, do people start to wonder if it's actually a failure.

But in the meantime they will be proposing a 3rd layer to create a lightning network of lightning networks, which might actually allow it to scale to a million million nodes tops, which could mean Lightning has won their gamble, if they can pull it off.

Meanwhile, BCH will be scaling on-chain and adding value in every way possible.

So, what we're facing is a scaling race. 

Betting it all on Lightning is much riskier proposition than what BCH is attempting, and I am a BCH partisan for that and many other reasons, but the game is not decided yet, and who can say how it will ultimately shake out.

There is a lot that can go wrong in Lightning even apart from failing to scale, and they may face significant hiccups.

But the point is, there needs to be a schelling point to create an actual flippening. And it would likely need to correlate to some very public failure of Lightning coupled to a very public success of BCH.";22;5;False;Anenome5;dsyp6rb;"""The more you learn about crypto the less % BTC you hold in your portfolio..."" - Ran Neuner";7rp5gl;https://twitter.com/cryptomanran/status/954607120003026944

 He's too concerned with defending his own little territory he's carved up.  He doesn't like new ideas unless they come from him.  He regularly shoots down the ideas of developers much smarter than him, because he didn't think of it first.  And because he sees power first and control before any other criterion.  If he anoints someone with a ""yes"" for his idea or proposal -- he first needs to make sure that person is very loyal and controllable.

He is shit at actually producing good software.  And it shows. Bitcoin has stagnated massively under his ""leadership"" as a piece of software.

"Don't hold your breath. My understanding is that the original code is pretty obtuse. However, it has shown to be secure over the past 10 years - so far only about 5 show-stopper bugs, and 2 or 3 hard forks. Not bad for a continuously-available peer-to-peer network...

"Well crypto is its own property. If they intend for a trustee to hold property in trust for the benefit of a beneficiary, there is no need to convert.

The problem arises when funds are held in a trust account to pay the attorney for services rendered. This is where it can get sticky, where some bars (I am sure) require crypto to be exchanged at that time to be held in a client trust account (to then pay the attorney for fees and expenses related to their representation)

Edit - I have not run into this problem specifically but I am governed by Florida Rules which generally allow it.
