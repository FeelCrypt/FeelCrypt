"> No. This subreddit is for people *refusing* the takeover, and insisting on following Bitcoin's original design philosophy. 

It kind of is. @Bitcoin twitter has fallen victim, this subreddit used to be more neutral too. I mean, do Ethereum Classic and Ethereum have endless discussions about who the real Ethereum is? No! This is an attempt to takeover.

"This is actually what a lot of people do, they make subreddits and then squat on them, with no intention of actively moderating or improving the subreddit.

This is actually a perfectly normal thing to do, and if the op didnt want to get pinged by admins and get all mad about it, all he would have had to do was make one post every 3 months to avoid it.

I could have done the same request, if i wanted an inactive subreddit with tiny subscriber count, but evidently Bitcoin mods were the only one who noticed.

Visit the /r/bitcoinforks subreddit.  Then, check out /r/redditrequest .  Reddit Request is the subreddit to apply for ownership of another community under the conditions that the existing mod team has gone AWOL (typically defined as several months completely inactive, and ignoring all PMs).  

/r/bitcoinforks.  There's about 2 posts in total, across the past 10 months.  It is as dead as a ghost town.

OP doesn't care to share a screenshot or a post in /r/redditrequest or disclose how the admins notified him of the 'hostile takeover'?  We don't even have proof that someone tried to take it, just his word.

">Is that true?

Can't say, without any screenshot or proof.  But reddit does have an established protocol for anyone to put in a request for mod for a dead & inactive subreddit.  Check out /r/redditrequest , basically if the entire mod team of a subreddit is completely inactive for a couple months and doesn't answer PMs, then the reddit admins will give control of the subreddit to the first person who asks (after an application and review).  /r/bitcoinforks certainly looks completely dead & inactive, with the lone mod having made just 1 post in the last 5 months, so I wouldn't be surprised if an admin was doing a wellness-checkup on behalf of someone else asking for that good domain name.";6;0;False;McBurger;e0vcq8t;Hi I'm the moderator of r/bitcoinforks and r/bitcoin mods tried to take over my subreddit;8rz0uy;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8rz0uy/hi_im_the_moderator_of_rbitcoinforks_and_rbitcoin/

I totally agree with the censorship, I just find it very hypocrite to say especially in this subreddit which is all about taking over, especially with biased mods that are hatespeeching all the time. Like this guy who moderates three Bitcoin Cash subreddits:

>There are rumors going around that S&D is actually the massive troll WhalePanda. I wouldn’t be surprised if it is. Also, MoneyTrigz is a scammer. It seems all these scammers run together

Don't you agree that this BTC vs BCH argument does not solve any problems?

I agree a little bit that some things are silly. But when development started to get monopolized, when people started realizing how one specific mod has a lot of power by wielding a monopoly on forums and domains such as Bitcointalk, the bitcoin wiki, bitcoin.org, and r/bitcoin. When you see these things an individual should question the integrity of what is happening. The split may not have happened if monopolies were squashed immediately but instead the majority has let them thrive. The BCH side of the argument is mere blowback and I think it should be much louder. I think concentration need to be more focused on all the tentacles involved too rather than just Blockstream. There is corporate money that is a conflict of interest at the heart of what bitcoin was meant to be from MIT's DCI, Chain Code, and Blockstream. Maybe people need to follow these monopolies more closely and see where they derive. Social media and forums there are huge red flags stemming from a group that controls many forums and domains. Development same thing. I agree fighting is silly. Exposing blatant fraudulence is needed and that's why I spoke up today.   ;13;0;False;CobraTheymos;e0vawmf;Hi I'm the moderator of r/bitcoinforks and r/bitcoin mods tried to take over my subreddit;8rz0uy;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8rz0uy/hi_im_the_moderator_of_rbitcoinforks_and_rbitcoin/

r/cryptocurrency moderation has changed hands over the past seven months. This is clear as day. It is highly suspected that r/bitcoin mods now have control over the r/cryptocurrency subreddit. Coincidently around that same time r/bitcoin mods tried to claim r/bitcoinforks multiple times.
