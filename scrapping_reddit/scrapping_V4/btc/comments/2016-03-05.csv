Any sane Bitcoin company must at this point be at least *investigating* alternative cryptocurrency support. They may well have experimental code for it ready to go. But I suspect that when big infrastructure companies like Coinbase flip the switch to enable those alternatives it'll be the true death-knell for Bitcoin so I'm not surprised they're working quietly right now.

"This whole blocksize issue really comes down to folks having different visions on what bitcoin is/should be. 

 If you're on the business side and prefer to see global and mainstream adoption, you will likely side with Classic in the hopes that this is the best way to accelerate forward.  Businesses are interested in this direction.

On the other hand, if you think that bitcoin should remain a (very solid) project settlement system, with no compromises and all of its integrity intact, then stick with core, but you won't be seeing accelerated innovation or mass adoption anytime soon.  Idealists or folks not looking for opportunity will fit best in this camp.

Real intelligence is not expressed by depth of fluency in one language, but rather by the deep understanding of structure of language itself and thus truly intelligent people demonstrate the ability to see the connections between different languages and move fluidly between them - speech is form of social expression, which is rhythmic, and those rhythms are mathematical algorithms which you can code to express a philosophical idea in the world.  Any well trained person can excel in a particular field with discipline and time.  Intelligence is the ability to see the intimacies of the interrelationships between the fields and thereby use your depth in one to be able to communicate complex ideas in and about the others.

"The problem is developers don't want/think they need input from business analysts or other's with ""soft skills.""  The vast majority of crypto related companies seem to be founded by developers who only hire developers.  The attitude is that if they build a good technical system people will find them and use it, even if it's difficult to understand/use and doesn't address problems the average user has. Obviously this is flawed thinking.


Too often, the founders/developers ignore the need for business development, sales, marketing, product management, etc. roles.  I'm actively looking to work in the industry and have relevant experience, knowledge, and soft-skills to contribute, but because I can't code, there don't seem to be relevant jobs to even apply to.";1;0;False;PhoenixJ3;d0of3aw;What Happened At The Satoshi Roundtable;48z1eb;https://medium.com/@barmstrong/what-happened-at-the-satoshi-roundtable-6c11a10d8cdf#.t2hewehcp
Major Bitcoin business should finance miners by tipping them for every Classic block mined.;1;0;False;painlord2k;d0okc9x;What Happened At The Satoshi Roundtable;48z1eb;https://medium.com/@barmstrong/what-happened-at-the-satoshi-roundtable-6c11a10d8cdf#.t2hewehcp
"The best solution would be to ""extra fund"" the miners mining the Classic blocks.
Every time a transaction is done, the block including the transaction get a fee.
Allow the wallet to ""automatically"" send the same amount of the fee paid to the last mined Classic block blockchain transaction.

Send Y coin to X
Send F(ee) amount to last Classic Block Coinbase
Fee

In effect the Classic blocks would share these tips.
The few would get more, but as more try to get the tips, the they would share them.

This would prioritize Classic miners to mine Classic supporting transactions.

If 5% of the blocks support 50% of the users, they would get their x fees plus 10x tips (with fees around 1% of the reward, the tips would become relevant and interesting to mine). And the larger reward for the earlier miners would someway offset the variability of block mining.";1;0;False;painlord2k;d0okc09;What Happened At The Satoshi Roundtable;48z1eb;https://medium.com/@barmstrong/what-happened-at-the-satoshi-roundtable-6c11a10d8cdf#.t2hewehcp

"> On the other hand, if you think that bitcoin should remain a (very solid) project settlement system, with no compromises and all of its integrity intact

Please tell me why anyone would base their currency or asset on Bitcoin right now when its blocks are full and fees are rising? If the users go then the value goes. If all that's left is a bank settlement system then why start with an open system not designed for your purpose instead of creating your own shared database?

"Yes. It could also be much more than 50%. In theory, we could end up with only the hard-core mining at a significant loss.
