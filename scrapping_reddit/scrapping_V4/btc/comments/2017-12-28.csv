"Banks fuel wars, war is bank business, war brings instability, higher interest rates, new loans on both sides of the war

Speculative bubbles are fueled by people trying to make money by speculating... not by people investing into their beliefs, actually using the product they believe in...

The speculator creates the expected value with a click of a mouse, the real value comes from the person being totally into the thing and supporting it and actually doing it

You raise false expectations when you say that something is NOT possible just because YOU can not imagine it... I totally believe that crypto has the ability to change the world entirely and be the biggest thing in human history.";1;1;False;bitcornio;druh52x;rBitcoin logic: Cashing out?

"Yeah they do but so what? Why do you think there will be no wars with a crypto based system? Why do you think banks explicitly cause wars? Even if everyone used cryptos why wouldn't governments would just pay arms dealers and contractors in cryptos? War makes money, banks deal in money, it's not surprising to me that banks figured out how to make money and honestly why shouldn't they if war is happening around them anyway? 

Speculative bubbles are caused by people buying something with the belief that it will be more valuable in the future regardless of any actual merits often based upon emotion and inadequate information - see the tulip bubble everyone is always talking about. And no the value doesn't come from the speculation, the speculation creates an inflated value that doesn't actually correspond to the true value of the asset. The true value comes from the merits of what is being speculated on. What does it do? Why should it be valuable? For example, take gold, it has a finite supply, doesn't corrode, has wide uses in manufacturing and technology and has a history of being valued by people.  You're right though adoption is important but at this point I know of very few people that actually USE cryptos the way they're intended as opposed to holding or trading. In fact, general wisdom in these crypto subs is don't spend anything cause it'll always be worth more in the future - pure speculation. 

And it's not that I can't imagine any of those things, those things would be great but it's that it's explicitly not the purpose of  any crypto project (that I know of) to solve any of those problems, nor should it be. I agree crypto can change the world but I don't think it can change the world in the way you think. Plus it's always better to underpromise and overdeliver than overpromise and underdeliver. 

Or I guess let me ask you, why do you think crypto can accomplish those things beyond poor nice people that made a bunch of money with crypto will do good things with the money because they aren't heartless billionaires or corporations? Cause if it's just that reasoning, history and human nature would suggest that isn't how it would play out. ";1;1;False;ubersketch;drulufj;rBitcoin logic: Cashing out?

Because it was created before the fork of BCH as an alternative to the highly-censored /r/Bitcoin, particularly when any talk about raising the blocksize was discussed. BCH did not yet exist, and a lot of Bitcoin Cash people still see the BCH chain as more in line philosophically with the original BTC chain than the small-block BTC chain today that no longer functions as cash (as the white paper originally called for) without a $30 fee. This arbitrarily high fee prices a lot of poorer people out of the market of the original chain.;1;1;False;tjmac;drud0pv;rBitcoin logic: Cashing out?

"Cryptos will have such strong effects on the society, hard to imagine the outcome...

Paypal will be slowly replaced by alternatives with lower fees, or Paypal will just lower his fees and their users will have 2% less to work! 2% less fees means 2% less work! (I assume you would buy everything on Paypal here, but it doesnt matter because Credit Card will also be replaced and Cash as well and everywhere we will save fees) How do you like 7 extra holidays per year!

Banks will be obsolete for most daily use cases, we wont need an online banking anymore, most people will pay with their smartphones

Loans will be made directly between the people, like https://www.saltlending.com/ offers already today. 
Loans without middleman, more transparency, better interest rates for both sides. Better interest rates means, ~~~ MORE HOLIDAYS ~~~

And whatever happens when the Euro or US Dollar crash again... nobody knows... 

When i look back at the past 20 years, how fast the internet progressed, the smartphones which popped up just 8 years ago. The smartphones are a key element to enable this revolution.

I think we can make the transition to crypto within the next decade! And i think it will work, because it is driven by the market and the self interest of the people who support it. Merchants want money, they will accept cryptopayments... Humans want freedom, they will put their money into crypto to hide it from the state... Humans want cheaper loans and cheaper fees... and everyone has the phone to use it already in his hand, just has to download the wallet!";1;0;False;bitcornio;druo3e8;rBitcoin logic: Cashing out?

"It could, very easily. But at this point, each side is pretty dug in. That’d be like a Democrat running on a pro-life agenda or a Republican on Medicare-for-All. It’s certainly possible, and might even be highly successful, but because of the vested interests at work, it’s also highly unlikely.

The BCH side wanted a blocksize increase to lower the fees for YEARS on the BTC chain to no avail, and it eventually had to come to a fork to get one in August, causing the two chains. When blockstream and the core developers shot down doubling the blocksize through the New York agreement (Segwit 2x), we saw the price of BCH go up nearly 10 times as frustrated BTC people who wanted a blocksize increase filtered in to the BCH camp.

Hopefully that helps explain a little bit of the frustration. Is each side childish sometimes? Absolutely. But the philosophical differences are real and deeply felt.

As a trader, I’d love to use the argument for my own financial independence, but unfortunately, the high fees of the BTC side make a poor dude like myself completely unable to trade BTC, which is exactly what they state they want. So with me, they got their wish. My BitPay card is effectively useless to pay bills with (until they enable BCH withdrawal, hopefully any day now!) and I’ve been thoroughly priced out of the Bitcoin Core chain having any real relevance in my daily life.

Wish it wasn’t that way, but that’s the path they’ve chosen. But on a positive note, we now have two options, and I’m excited to see the market work to pick between them. 

But, with money on the line, people gonna get crazy. Especially when the issue between the two chains is so easily defined.";1;0;False;tjmac;drun0tv;rBitcoin logic: Cashing out? You should kill yourself instead;7mbote;https://imgur.com/Fo8rZQi

Child porn rings provide a service yes, but unlike banks they operate entirely by illicit means so they aren't totally equivalent. Banks on the other hand (theoretically) operate within the confines of the law and are actually essential to the functioning on our modern economy and society in its current form.

"Fees are used to incentive miners to add your transaction to the blockchain.  You don't have to send a fee, but the miners don't have to add your transaction either.  In practice, there becomes a market rate in which you need to pay at least that amount to have a miner add your transaction to a block.  If you supply less than that amount, the miners will simply chose other transactions that offer more fees, and thus more reward to the miner.  Your transaction may get added later after the higher fee transactions or it may not get added at all if it's way too low.

There are [a lot](https://blockchain.info/unconfirmed-transactions) of unconfirmed transactions because people use fees below the market rate.  Long story short, the blockchain is constrained on throughput and the demand for sending BTC is much higher than the supply of space in the blocks.  So market forces have driven the price of transactions higher.

"And how long have they had them? That is the problem. Moore's law is the basis of why people say blockchain size isn't a concern, but moore's law has been dead for several years. For example;

I've had a 2TB drive in my computer since 2011. 6 years.

Moore's law is often viewed as tech capacity doubling every 1.5 years.

So if a 2TB drive was commonly available in 2011, then we should now have 64TB drives.

But we don't, [this](http://www.techradar.com/news/this-is-the-worlds-biggest-hard-drive-and-it-can-store-14tb) is the largest hard drive currently available. It is only 14TB. We are hitting physical limits to what we can create.

So people can say ""Moore's Law"" when the issue of blockchain size is raised, but clearly we are not longer progressing at that pace.

"The other day I joked that BTC wallets should have three fee options: “1. probably won’t work.”, “2. might work … eventually”, and “3. will probably work … but it’ll cost you."" The fact is that transacting on the BTC network increasingly means choosing whether your transaction will be one (or more realistically some combination of) the following: outrageously slow, outrageously expensive, or unreliable.  

The bottom line is that the situation is fucked and getting more fucked.

That's what you get when the rightward-shifting demand curve of increased adoption slams into the vertical line of an arbitrary supply quota.

The bottom line is this:  that a single transaction, be it BTC or BCH, consumes enormous amounts of energy (the precise calculations are almost impossible to assess) and the only reason why you're not paying $50 for a BCH transaction is due to the miner subsidies. But those will get whittled down to nothingness, at which point they'll be forced to make the users bear the brunt of it.

Well in one sense it’s already happened with Bitcoin Cash which raised the block size limit. But BCH was created as a rebranded minority “spinoff” and the hash rate majority chain continued as “BTC” with the limit in place. So ideally (if you want the BTC chain to win) it would look like a majority-supported upgrade of the BTC chain. How likely is it? Hard to say. Ironically, a lot of big blockers now have an interest in *preventing* the BTC chain from upgrading to allow bigger blocks because they’ve thrown their weight behind the Bitcoin Cash chain.;4;1;False;Capt_Roger_Murdock;drvkjkl;This.... this did not age well.;7mkyjy;https://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2014/11/WU-bitcoin-spoof-630x324.jpg

He obviously means older unconfirmed transactions. And yes, someone could. It takes time and work to include transactions, and in some cases we've seen blocks with no additional transactions due to how quick you can make the block and move to the next (with the high fees currently, that won't likely happen).

I've never used Bitmain, so I'm not aware of any issues they may have exclusively. Posting transactions directly to the blockchain is what I've been doing. I know that in the past there have been wild swings in hash power as it moves between BCH/BTC, which could slow down the occurrence of the next block. Hopefully that stabilizes as adoption accelerates. Luck can also play a factor in a block taking longer. For the most part, blocks should be found at 10 minute averages. My general experience is that txs show up within minutes. 0-conf should also make experience much more immediate as that becomes more wide spread.;3;1;False;mohrt;drv54ny;This.... this did not age well.;7mkyjy;https://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2014/11/WU-bitcoin-spoof-630x324.jpg

Bitcoin was designed with a temporary anti-spam limiter to prevent people from performing resource-consumption attacks when it was very new and insecure.

Turns out, that limit was an attack vector: the developers who control the protocol refuse to lift it, claiming all kinds of excuses, but the real reason is that all the most influential ones work for the same company whose business model just happens to depend on Bitcoin being unable to fix this problem.";11;0;False;jessquit;drvdrwf;This.... this did not age well.;7mkyjy;https://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2014/11/WU-bitcoin-spoof-630x324.jpg

"Bandwidth availability, hard drive capacity and CPU are all increasing (due to technology improvements) in rough proportion to the number of transactions going through the bitcoin network. 

Can we do Visa level now? No. Eventually? Very likely.

Bitcoin core artificially limited the transaction limit to the level of technology from 5-10 years ago. Then the transaction volume caught up.

Once that artificial cap goes away, technology improvements will allow us to scale at the same rate as marketshare increases.

While it's nowhere near visa levels of transactions take a look at ethereum. They do way more transactions than bitcoin core and their transaction fees are tiny. On-chain scaling is possible provided resources are invested in doing so, and the technology is not deliberately crippled.

Normally you are correct and you can't fix a systemic problem by changing one line of code. However, when that one line of code is *deliberate sabotage,* then yes, removing the wrench in the gears is going to make a difference.

"If I am rational and objective I see that Bitcoin as it was originally conceived has been bastardized and made worse by terrible decisions. The system and its economics have been changed, for no reason, without data or evidence to back up the claims backing those changes.

Its reputation as an open global money and an economy for the unbanked and marginalized has been sullied. We should speak out and make every effort to restore the system to its original promise. Otherwise we are just barely better than those who are doing the sullying.

"I'm ill atm (Christmas family flu fun) so I'll just summarize my response to you:

>Ya, good store of value that moves with the wind. Volatility is a function of reach of participation and depth of holdings. A store of value requires both for stability. How do I not understand 'SoV' again? How is BTC going to grow enough to have any sort of stability when more and more people are priced out of the market, even if they own BTC. Currently over 50% of wallets do not have enough BTC to even pay a miner fee and use it as a store of value at all. They're as good as destroyed, but it's nice to look at the balance if I could ever use it to buy something big, oh! But I can't. One crucial property is that it is durable, if your BTC is unable to be withdrawn, it's not durable.

- Where are you getting this ""Currently over 50% of wallets do not have enough BTC to even pay a miner fee""? I'm not saying you're wrong - just want to know where you got that info from.

- The store of value needs to exceed that of the transaction fees to redeem said value. Art auction houses also collect a fee - this may be a minimum fee, or a percentage of said value. If your work of art is valued and sold at $10, it'll not be worth exchanging if the auction fees are a minimum of $100 per sale.

- As I said: ""NOW. You could argue that BTC isn't a great store of value, since the inability to appropriate transact it may drive down the price. However, the consensus among the investors and market at the moment, is that BTC is worth + $14,000. As such, it is still a good store of value.""

>I love that you're so condescending and discounting but your answers are so shallow. Explain to me again how a Store of Value with a diminishing amount of participation will be worth more than another example, that does the exact thing (limited scarce good), but is literally free to move this 'value' around. Literally the only difference in between BCH and BTC in practice and in use is first mover advantage and utility. 

- You're trying to make this a BTC vs BCH argument, which I'm not interested in.

- You just had a misunderstanding about utility and store of value, which I have since corrected.

>Have you heard of Metcalfe's law?

Yes

>Have you heard about monetary velocity, whereas the speed of transaction allows for increased value due to increased exit points?

Yes

>Have you heard about the academic theory of 'best money'

Yes

>Instead of attacking someone, why don't you act more positively? If you want to 'teach' people, why are you not actually digging into the reasons why? Is it because you don't actually understand? Did you know that you have to be able to teach something in order to truly understand something?

- I'm not attacking anyone. If you feel you're being attacked, you're a tad insecure.

- You're the one who seems adamant on making this a BTC vs BCH argument.

- As I've said through each response, I'm just trying to educate you on Store of Value, when you said something which has no utility can't be a store of value - if that's true, explain art. 

>To answer specifically 'just consensus'. If no one believes that other people will accept the SoV or if they can't 'cash it in' later on, how will this consensus grow that it's a 'good place to put your wealth'? It will continually be that the largest balances will be able to use it but the smaller balances will be removed from viability, on an ongoing basis. 

- But people do believe it is a SoV (Hodlers), so what exactly is your point? Are you speaking hypotheticals?

> Do you think that fees will stop growing?

But whatever, I'm pooping right now, so let me take a stab at it.

Say EVERYONE in the world can make 50 Bitcoin/Cash transactions a day, but that means nodes cost $10,000/month to operate.

Who will run nodes? Well obviously miners will. But so will the tens or hundreds of thousands of businesses **worldwide** who now depend upon BTC/BCH transactions as part of their business model. Amazon, Walmart, China Inc, Etc will all run nodes because their business models depend upon being able to validate their own transactions. The cost of running a node will just be one more cost of doing business, and will be spread across their customer base, hidden in the price of every good and service.

So 100,000 nodes spread across the world, enabling everyone to participate in the network.

Or 100,000 global users rich enough to use the network, secured by miners and idiots with a Raspberry Pi.

"While I'd love to invest on principle, my current situation (college student looking to build an emergency fund) means I kinda have to invest on growth.

BTC has always left me scratching my head. Like, I remember hearing wears ago when it reached $200, then a few months later hearing it reached $1000 and being completely perplexed as to how it happened (Mt. Gox happened).

After that it mostly has been making sense until a couple of weeks after the BCH fork. I can understand it creeping up a bit, but the growth it has currently seen is simply unsustainable, and with the current fees it's completely unusable as a coin except for really large transactions (large enough that volatility kills it). People always try and debate how crypto as a whole isn't a Ponzi, but current BTC really feels like one.

ETH had its mining bubble, but after that it has been mostly stable considering regular crypto growth. The issue with ETH is that it's kinda like string theory or higgs boson, people will say that they understand it to look smart but to really understand you need more than just some videos and a quick glance. That doesn't mean that ETH is the r/rickandmorty coin or similar, it's just that the different uses it can have and the contracts and subcoins can make it a bit INTIMIDATING. That's without all of the conspiracy fuzz around the coin, but unless more backdoors can be found on the clients themselves or something more compromising than DAO I'll consider that just light speculation.

BCH should in theory be the best coin out there because of its heritage and room for growth on the technology side, yet on the investment side where I could've had like 500% growth on BTC (wtf) and some 80% on ETH, BCH only grew by 10% during the last couple of months. BCH is weak in that even though I believe that it is the future of digital physical cash (along with ETH being relegated to the internet), it's not where the eyes of the investors are. And it stagnates because of it. BCH will survive when BTC falls (or at least not fall as hard as BTC), but until that happens it's only BTC all the way.";4;2;False;xxfay6;druficz;Honest Opinion: I hate both subs;7mh1wm;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7mh1wm/honest_opinion_i_hate_both_subs/

"And what happened a few months ago when I spent a lot of time telling people that the lies and FUD about SegWit transactions being stolen? I got downvoted, and accused of being a shill and a troll. People were literally upvoting posts saying that any money in a segwit address can be stolen at any point by a miner, and other miners, exchanges, and wallets would be cool with this.  Ignoring any technical reasons why this wouldn't happen, and you know what? I have been right so far, I'd love to see someone try and steal segwit transactions and see what happens to their block as it's rejected by the rest of the network.

People say it's (SegWit) not implemented in the Bitcoin Core client?

"So Segwit increased a certain, rarely used, type of transaction by 1.7x over what Pre-Segwit Bitcoin could do.  It also changed how these transactions work and gave them a discount, changing the economics of Bitcoin.

It did fix malleability, not needed for LN and did so in a very over complex way, creating a lot of technical complexity.  BCH fixed malleability in a hardfix a month ago, simpler and better.

People are not adopting Segwit because it is complex to do so.  It is risky. The costs to do so are high and the rewards small. Sure you can pay only $15 for your transaction, using Segwit, but first you have to move your coins to Segwit address, that costs a bunch.  Might as well just get a coin that works and is not crippled.

So no, Segwit was never a block increase, but some malicious actors tried to claim you did not need to hardfork a blocksize increase, because Segwit would supplant the need.  BCH forked, increased blocksize, hardforked a malleabilty fix and works much better than Segwitcoin.

Now about LN, we are just not to a point where it is necessary.

"That's a false narrative. It's a currency as much as bitcoin/litecoin/dogecoin is. It's called fuel because Tx fees are calculated in ""gas"".  Where Bitcoin calculates fees as **satoshi per byte**; Ethereum calculates **gas per script opcode**.  You choose to do adds, multiplications and sstore in your contract code, then you pay 10^^1 gas + 20 gas + 500 gas respectively for each opcode type.  Then as the user, you choose how much ether you are willing to pay per gas, which is called the **gas price** of your transaction.

A Tx fee on ethereum is gas price multiplied by gas used (sum of all gas required to run all opcodes called during Tx execution).  So that's why Ether is called **fuel**, but it is simply a different way to calculate Tx fees than how bitcoin does it.

It doesn't make Ether any less of a currency than bitcoin.

"I would like to see a transaction using Segwit.  Sure it is there, but as predicted, it is not being used in any great way and it is not helping. It never will help.

People know that it being on the command line is not useful.  People know that it is implemented on the command line, people do not care.  You are downvoted because you are ignoring what any reasonable person would not ignore.

How is a claim that LN can be a fractional reserve, a lie? I mean, once LN actually works, once it exists in about as real a way as Segwit, then we can talk about what LN is and is not, until then, your guess is as good as everyone else's.  I am pretty certain it will be a centralized, censored, costly way of doing things I do not really want to do, but time will tell.

We all know LN may be coming to BCH. Well, I know BCH will have payment channels, that function, before BTC will.  I do not know why people would downvote you for that.  Though, I also know that BCH does not need them, not at least in the near decades, so if your argument is that because BCH might get them, they make sense, I would disagree.

I am here, because I believe in Bitcoin, not what Core turned BTC into.  I am here, because years ago we all agreed larger blocks were the best path forward.

"Sorry for asking tons of questions, but after mining ""for fun"" I've basically fallen behind on rescent developement with every cryptocurrency I've been using, as is evident by my first post

First of all I never said it's necessary for malleability to be fixed in order for the LN to be implemented, but it seems to make it more complex. I'm not sure why, but I'm looking into the source code on my spare time. BCH did not entirely fix malleability, it just replicated one of the BIPs, which prevented ids from being changed in crucial instances. I think this is also because the direction that BTC and BCH want to go when to comes to fixing the scaling problem is much different.

"I understand that LN requires opening and funding a channel, incurring a Bitcoin, or whatever Blockchain they decide on, transaction for a period of time.  That you can add funding to the channel, but that if you choose to close out the channel, some time must pass and another blockchain transaction must occur.

So BTC is horribly broken and there seems to be not much desire to fix it.  Yes there is space for Segwit transactions, which LN will invariably be, but how many?  The LN paper called for 133MB blocks.  That is 133x what some of the current BTC developers claim is already too big.  How is stuffing more transactions into the limited transaction space going to make anything move better?

Oh but I can do many fundings with my one channel? Except that I do not do that, except for subscriptions.  That does not cover 95% of what I use crypto for.  I am not going to lock up $1,000 in value with NewEgg, for a month, to buy a graphics card.  It is completely nonsensical for me to use LN to buy a widget.  Not when there are dozens of other available coins, that I can use to do it nearly instantly, with little cost and hassle.

So subscriptions...  Then, you will hear that large blocks cause centralization and decrease censorship resistance, but no one will tell you how.  They will claim it makes nodes more expensive, except non-mining nodes do not matter.  You can run one, but it is not improving Bitcoin.  In fact, larger blocks are simple, easy, cheap.  BCH went from 1 to 8MB blocks and nothing changed, except it does not have massively expensive fees and large transaction backlogs.

So you will hear that this only because it does not have the same transaction volume.  Not true.  Because once we have 5x the  transaction volume of BTC, we will increase to 32MB blocks, without a hardfork.  And when we have 20x the transaction volume of BTC, we will fork to 100MB blocks.  About this time LN might be ready to use.

Of course, use LN.  So lock up some funds, to run a hub, buy a money transmitter license, so you can run a hub, do all of the KYC/AML stuff, so you can report who is sending what to whom.  It will be costly to run an LN hub.  So you will likely sign up with an Exchange or a BitPay like company, to send your channel through. They will have a fee, maybe even a monthly service.  Gosh Credit Cards aren't seeming too bad, right now.

Honestly, LN does not yet exist.  I really do not know if it will work or can work.  I know it has not been tested in the regulatory space, not sure if someone is doing that research.  It is just ridiculous, to me, that when we have not even began to test the limits of scaling on the blockchain, we are talking about 2nd Layers.  2nd Layers for casinos, sure or contracts or non-financial transactions, like IP.  But 2nd layers for the financial ledgers, when we are using the same blocksize that was functional, nearly a decade ago, that was put in place for the limited numbers of miners, that is purely idiotic to me.

And I do not think everyone is stupid.  So I start to see this as more malicious.  I mean, you can mine Bitcoin, but how else to you monetize it? I always imagined that there would still be places offering banking like services, ala Coinbase.  The existing financial players, the rent seekers, how do they exist in a crypto world? LN.  How do you make LN seem reasonable? Cripple Bitcoin.  What did Core do? Cripple Bitcoin.  So, yes, I see LN as the selling out to the existing power paradigm, keeping the status quo and nothing changing, like we had planned.";1;0;False;jcrew77;drvoa0u;Honest Opinion: I hate both subs;7mh1wm;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7mh1wm/honest_opinion_i_hate_both_subs/

"> I would like to see a transaction using Segwit. Sure it is there, but as predicted, it is not being used in any great way and it is not helping. It never will help.

Looked in last block: https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/transaction/33f080470bcca4e5ecc1da0720d080ff2f8dbdabb07ad63d82ae42c3f88fbf77 has witness data.

> People know that it being on the command line is not useful. People know that it is implemented on the command line, people do not care. You are downvoted because you are ignoring what any reasonable person would not ignore.

I agree it's bad that it's not there, but saying it's not implemented is wrong.

> How is a claim that LN can be a fractional reserve, a lie? I mean, once LN actually works, once it exists in about as real a way as Segwit, then we can talk about what LN is and is not, until then, your guess is as good as everyone else's. I am pretty certain it will be a centralized, censored, costly way of doing things I do not really want to do, but time will tell.

It's simply not true, if you've actually done any research you'll see that the funds are locked in a channel with an on-chain payment.  There is no ""lending"", if my channel runs out of funds then I need to add more or open another, you can only send money on LN if it's already locked in a channel.

LN on mainnet, transactions have already been made: http://bitcoinist.com/lightning-network-mainnet-beta-soon/

> We all know LN may be coming to BCH. Well, I know BCH will have payment channels, that function, before BTC will. I do not know why people would downvote you for that. Though, I also know that BCH does not need them, not at least in the near decades, so if your argument is that because BCH might get them, they make sense, I would disagree.

I agree, I have no idea why people downvoted it, it's not wrong either.

> I am here, because I believe in Bitcoin, not what Core turned BTC into. I am here, because years ago we all agreed larger blocks were the best path forward. I was here because Core fucks DDoS's my Unlimited Nodes. I was here because the good, talented developers were not part of the Core Client team and the Core Client team had censored rBitcoin. So yes, to me, this sub represents Bitcoin. I do not care what other people think. In fact, this negative opinion of rBTC signals a low information person, to me. It helps me weed out their opinions on things.

Certainly don't support that kind of behaviour, I think both sides have bad actors.

> See, I would be cool with you, but then you spread lies like your last paragraph. Who cares who fake Satoshi or real Satoshi are? You should educate yourself on the coins. What does it matter anyway? The total supply did not change, it did suppress the price, it may have been the cost in order to bootstrap BCH, but who cares? People who cannot attack BCH on the technical merits. People who know that it is superior to Segwit and LN, that is solves real problems, but have an emotional investment in a Legacy, dying blockchain. That is who cares about these 120,000 additional, and falling, coins.

I care about Fake Satoshi because he is claiming something he is unwilling to prove, I've read the book, I've seen the interviews, it stinks, and some people play it down because he's ""on your side"".  A lot of non technical people are being bamboozled (IRL someone I know told me his wife has ""met Satoshi Nakamoto""... He literally told me his wife met the ""inventor of bitcoin"" when he knew I was interested in it. That's why I care about it, I'm not fooled, and you probably know better, but the uninitiated are falling for these kinds of scams and lies.)

I care about bitcoin because I want a free and trust-less currency, one that's both transparent and offers the highest level of security.  You run a node, so I expect you to understand why it's important to some people to verify, rather than blindly accept transactions.  From a purely technical point of view, yes, only miners and exchanges really need to run full nodes, but that's empowering a small number of people, and we need to explicitly trust these people to act in bitcoin's interests, which may not necessarily align with their own, a node under my control means that _I_ don't _have_ to trust them.

I don't think you understood my point, it's not simply about the inflation of 120,000 coins, it's how they ended up in the hands of half a dozen people, they literally forked bitcoin, printed 120,000 extra coins (current price $300 million), and expect me to be OK with it?  Oh and they haven't all ended up actually being sold, in fact they are being held, which might decrease the amount of coins available and moving on exchanges, which can lead to a price inflation.  The software developers are supposed to be the custodians of the system, and the miners secure it and get paid for it, they shouldn't be able to choose which rules to implement, because they will choose the ones that make them the most money, in some cases this is not a bad thing, it's sad that it's gotten to the point where only half a dozen people can do as they please (I suspect the reason they don't is because they know how it will impact the coin).";1;1;False;Crully;drvr0pt;Honest Opinion: I hate both subs;7mh1wm;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7mh1wm/honest_opinion_i_hate_both_subs/

I don't disagree. It certainly is politics. But that isn't necessarily a bad thing.

However in this case, most, if not all, of the claims made on either side can be (dis)proven with simple research on the matter. Some of the debate is opinion which is left up to the reader to discern, but the technical details are verifiable by anybody.

I think it's important to pick a side in this debate specifically because it literally means either a successful or failed future for Bitcoin. Not whether we get ""the lesser of two evils"" as has been the case in the American voter circle-jerk.

Idk, to each their own, I am just invested in Bitcoin (Cash) because of the potential it brings, and I see that BTC / r/Bitcoin has hindered this potential. This is why I support BCH.

1) BTC/BCH PoW option against PoS with account representatives.
2) BTC/BCH original Blockchain against Account and balance based Blockchains
3) BTC/BCH recent price volatility compared with XRB valorization. Is this a sign of early market adoption?

Centralization is why people are against bigger blocks, among a few other reasons. Short term it probably is the way to go, but long term it seems like the scaling solution doesn't scale lol bitcoin is already fairly centralized with something like 2 mining pools controlling ~51% of the network, and don't get me started on bitcoin cash's centralization issues. Making these networks even more centralized is dangerous, but not as dangerous as million dollar transaction fees. The whole thing has turned into some weird tribal pissing match though, making constructive debate all but impossible. Sad.

"access is only ""core"" - yes, it's like 5 devs or something I believe -- but I think only 1 of them is ""blockstream"" and as I understand it Greg M took away his own access (?) 

Again, and I'm sure I'll be called various names for pushing on this, but I want the truth and I research things often and I want to get to the bottom of this all, so again -- the committs being shown in the history for github are showing that blockstream comes nowhere close to being more than like 10% of all the commits,  So again, I say how is 10% of commits by potentially blockstream paid developers (I think Luke Jr is technically a consultant and isn't paid by blockstream) how is 10% some kind of controlling factor here?   I think only 1 or 2 blockstream developers are even in the top 20 devs that have commits.   

So I ask again, how is it that blockstream ""owns"" anything here?  It's still very amorphous to me.

"Well I don't mean in terms of wrongdoing. Just that, in my experience, board members of various organizations often have wildly different and opposing opinions on how things should be done. So if one board member invests his personal money in a company, it's entirely possible that the majority of the board thinks he's an idiot for doing that and doesn't support it at all. Likewise, the individual on the board might disagree completely with the direction the organization is going, and is simply being outvoted. Thus, it would not follow that the company the board member invested in is controlled by the organization he's on the board of.

But, maybe I'm an idiot, and the articles are spot on. My only point is to emphasize the need to verify, because if we support one thing that is easily disproven, then /r/Bitcoin will use that one mistake to make it seem like all our claims are wrong. And the chain of premises in that article is really long, which makes it tempting to only partly verify and then just give up and assume that all the rest is true too.

"jesus I'm not a core anything.   I've been a redditor for 8 years and I think what was done to bitcoin was a horrible thing, regardless of who did it.  Bitcoin Cash is much closer to the orginal bitcoin ideal.

my reply is NOT unclear.   I'm asking for facts, for a timeline of events.

There is nothing concrete about what happened after Satoshi handed things over to the various guardians.   It all turns to mush and words like ""they turned against each other"" -- what does that even mean, it's entirely too vague.   I'm curious as to who did what when and to whom, For example did Gavin and Mike say ""hey we're doing ""x"" "" and Greg and whomever begin to campaign against this idea of ""x"" 

What I've been told right now is entirely too sloppy to be any kind of accurate account of history.  I knew as soon as I started questioning the loose and vague narrative I'd immediately be labeled something.  

I just want a clear account of things because right now it's perfectly clear UNTIL Satoshi leaves then it turns into a muddled mess that brings us to where we are now.   I want to know how people aquired power, who was supporting them, what were the moves that were made by Gavin and his various followers that got ostracised - was he in the wrong at all, what did people say against Mike Hearn that caused him to depart, who supported Greg and allowed him to aquire power, when did Adam Back become involved, etc.

"You are of course right that actions of one board members do not necessarily reflect the opinion of the entire board. I also agree that the tone of the primary research source is a little conspiratorial, especially in attempting to make a link between cryptocurrencies and the Bilderberg Group. He might be right on the money, but the evidence is purely circumstantial. So let’s look at the stronger claims.

It is beyond dispute that DTCC is involved in development of crypto payment systems, and that DTCC is part of the FED. It also a fact that AXA strategic ventures has a controlling stake in Blockstream. Every other claim is just based on personal connections of board members and CEOs. This last point should not be seen as spurious though. If a board of a significant crypto entity is infiltrated by poster boys of the Status Quo, then one should proceed with caution. The number of personal links that point to the establishment suggests likelihood of a moremor less covert but nonetheless coordinated effort to gain control.

What about the motive? I think thie motive is an elephant in the room. You have a rapidly expanding system that flaunts tax evasion, flaunts traceability, in a political environment of militarised paranoia. What could possibly go wrong? You think the old dudes who have been running the show for decades are blind, deaf or stupid? I don’t think so. It is near certain that they are quite,y engaged in a takeover of this opportunity for their own purposes. Perhaps just to deanonimise it and subordinate it, perhaps something more.

This bring me the primary piece of evidence that should alert everyone in the crypto world to major changes coming this way: IRS v Coinbase. This is to me the most significant development since Bitcoin was born, and could well herald its death or transformation into a mechanism of control. The fact is, once wallets are deanonymised, every step in the Blockchain can be attributed to a person, retrospectively, all the way to the first transaction. I am sure people have done a lot of things they will soon regret because of assuming that Bitcoin will remain anonymous forever.

"You've focused on the idea that someone ""owns"" Bitcoin, and want answers to what people mean by that. 

Generally, the word ""owned"" in the Bitcoin debates is used in the sense of ""getting owned"" (see Wikipedia: Its a 1990s hacker slang that referred to ""rooting"" or gaining administrative control over someone else's computer. The term eventually spread to gamers, who used the term to mean defeat in gaming.)

Pointing to commit logs is an entirely inappropriate measure of whether or not Bitcoin has ""got owned"" in the sense above.

The SINGLE key to the Core developer cabal's ""owning Bitcoin"" has been their refusal to commit the single, ready and waiting solution to scaling Bitcoin - an appropriate block-size increase. And that they have owned Bitcoin by failing to act, has been disguised by their pie-in-the-sky promise of a never-materializing magic of Lightening Network that they are always working on, further disguised by their portrayal of Segwit as a de facto block-size increase, and by running a trolling and shilling factory to huff and puff about LN and Segwit. 

The reality is that the Core developer cabal - now provably representative of Blockstream - have, simply, tried their very best to ""own"" Bitcoin. The commit logs you point to don't reflect this at all. 

Ultimately, the Core developer cabal of Blockstream haven't actually succeeded in owning Bitcoin because at the last minute as it were, the original Bitcoin and it's blockchain were saved in the form of Bitcoin Cash which launched on 1 August and which has continued, unencombered by Segwit, unencumbered by the Core developer cabal's Github hedgemony over commits, and unencumbered by the the throttlingly small blocksize of Core's Segwit coin.

"1. The miners still do, but there is risk for the miners. SegWit is also non-reversible.

https://bitcrust.org/blog-incentive-shift-segwit

2. No, they don't own the Bitcoin project or the name. But they took over it by censorship and misinformation.

If one person tells you today, 2+2=5, you would probably laugh at him and say he's wrong. But if everyone says 2+2=5, you might believe it even if there is no evidence.

The plan was to increase blocks. 2MB, 4MB, 8MB etc. Bitcoin Cash wouldn't exist neither r/BTC. Starting from 2015, theymos (the moderator of r/bitcoin and he controls bitcoin.org and bitcointalk.org) started saying that he opposed big blocks. At first he got downvoted heavily (-700) then he started the censorship alongside with the mods. 

r/Bitcoin went from pro-big blocks to pro-small blocks. This is how Blockstream ruined Bitcoin.

- Added RBF - RBF is risky as a person can do a charge back if the tx is not confirmed. It also removed 0-conf feature.

- SegWit - They said SegWit would solve the problem, but it didn't. SegWit allows 5.5 TPS, while Bitcoin 1MB blocks allow 3 TPS.

- Censorship and Brainwashing - People still believe that if everyone used SegWit the mempool would directly go empty. I was arguing with a guy on /r/conspiracy about BTC and he said that BCH didn't solve the scaling issue even though it did. BCH can handle 24 TPS without blocks getting full. 


https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/6rxw7k/z/dl8v4lp (history of r/BTC and r/Bitcoin)

3. I'm not really sure but I think Mike and Gavin were either kicked out or they left the Core team. I don't know about Mike, but it seems Gavin is creating Graphene, which will compress blocks 10x. 1MB will become 10MB, 8MB will become 80MB, and so on.

4. I don't know but I don't think so because SegWit is like removing a feature. Example, your iPhone has a camera. The newer iPhones that come out will have no camera anymore. 

I plan to make 3 posts soon. 

1) An update about this one (in a few weeks)

2) A post about BCH's risks in the future

"Regarding item 4 (""Theymos caught red-handed - why he censors all the forums he controls, including /r\/bitcoin""):

There is no evidence that the account originally known as Theymos has any current control over any bitcoin-related forum. It seems much more likely that administrative access to those fora was sold to some other organization (maybe one controlled by Blockstream), and they are now manned 24x7 by significant numbers of paid staff no longer connected with the original Theymos. This sale would almost certainly have been under non-disclosure, so you will not find the original Theymos confirming or denying anything.

Regarding item 25 (i.e., ""Luke-Jr thinks reducing the blocksize will reduce the fees""):

I think you should avoid citing any single isolated fragment of text. If somebody truly believes something, you should be able to find multiple instances of that belief being expressed, or a longer text (e.g., an entire blog posting) supporting that claim.

If the only example you can find is a single isolated fragment, then citing that may give the average unbiased reader the impression that you are grasping at straws.";1;0;False;ray-jones;druing2;Updated (Dec 2017).

I want to know what happened when Satoshi took his name off the bitcoin.org website and replaced it essentially with Gavin's, moving forward.   Who did Gavin bring into the fold, why did they consider bringing in Greg - what did greg begin to do, was their in-fighting even before Greg was involved?  When did Adam Back get mixed into this?  Why was blockstream formed, and by whom - were there signs of all of this happening that in hindsight were there, etc.

I want history, not theory.  

I'm well aware of the block size increase position - it was Satoshi that actually put the 1mb limit in place to begin with.

Again, i'm going to get downvoted because people don't like that I'm not accepting the narrative at face value.    No one yet has given me a history.   

I want the same kind of thing that is in that archieved link about the censorship and such - I want that kind of information and breakdown specific to the inner workings of the devs and their relationship.

Also, how did the people that now ""control"" bitcoin get in control - who let them in?  how did they get in or win the trust over of the ""guardians""?   this is all very vague and seemingly no one can give me a straight answer on this.

As I said I know everything you've mentioned here - i want the real story, not ancedotes.  

I'm not a newbie - I know a ton about all of this, and I keep running into this vague fog of war when it comes to what actually occurred.

"Wow, people sure spend a lot of their free time playing join-the-dots conspiracy theories.
Wish I had that sort of free time on my hands, there are so many practical and productive things I could do with the time!

On to your points..Blockstream is a start up that develops side-chains for commercial applications, so it's no wonder they would have numerous corporate and venture capital investors.  Now just because Blockstream assists Bitcoin and its developers with funding doesn't mean they are handing Bitcoin over to the Bilderberg group, Mastercard and every Tom Dick and Harry.. that's ludicrous. This whole conspiracy theory is so ludicrous its laughable and there are as many holes in it as swiss cheese.. an entire warehouse of it :)

Now if I wanted to play join-the-dots and create a conspiracy theory I could pick just about any crypto-currency google its founders, its investors and I'm sure I could come up with something juicy. Even good ole BCH, there are plenty dots there to join up, like a Bank investing in BU's best buddy nChain or the Chinese miners funding BitcoinABC's lead developer and the list goes on and on. Let's not even mention Chinese miner collusion, market manipulation and a propaganda war based on blatant misleading information.

I have seen numerous conspiracy theories about Blockstream but I have not seen one single FACT that supports the notion they have handed over or will hand over any part of Bitcoin to any third party.  Have you?

"> To be fully secure in your transactions you run your own node and broadcast your own transactions to the network. 

This is incorrect.  You will be just as secure if you run an SPV client. In both cases you must trust that a majority of the hashpower is honest.  In both cases, to be secure in receiving payments you must wait a small number of confirmations if you don't trust the payer not to attempt a double spend.  If you run your own node then you may need one fewer confirmations for a given level of confidence.  

The principal benefit of running a node is confidentiality.  No one knows what's in your wallet or how often you check your balance. The other benefit is a minor speed up in obtaining confidence that you have been paid.  Except for very large businesses this benefit is not worth the bother of running a full node.
