"The advice in the popup does not make sense, does it?  Breaking a transaction into smaller ones will only increase the total fee. 

If the original has 500 inputs and it is broken into 10 txs of 50 inputs, the percentage increase in the cost will be rather small.  However, if the original had 5 inputs and the excessive fee is due to use of a broken fee estimator, then splitting could even double the total cost.

""Broken fee estimator"" is in fact a pleonasm.  When there is a backlog, fee estimation is an unsolvable problem, like estimating the bid that would win a blind closed-bid auction.  Even with access to the recently mined blocks and the current mempool, there is no way to predict the delay for a given fee level.  Moreover,  any fee estimation method that is widely used will defeat itself.  Those who try to do it, like 21.inc and Core, will only succeed in proving their incompetence.

When there is no backlog, on the other hand, fee estimators are not needed, because any transaction that pays the standard minimum fee will be confirmed in the next block.

">  the self-interest in a functional [PoS] network and already invested capital of hodlers can be used to secure the network. Whereas in Bitcoin most coins are just idle capital.

As we have seen in bitcoin, holders, traders, and users are almost disjoint populations, and have very different short-term goals. For one thing, holders want the price to grow, and the faster the better; traders want it to see-saw like crazy; while users want the price to be stable.

Bitcoin traders and holders have made it practically useless for legal payments.  PoS would give holders more control over development, fees, etc; that may hurt users too in the short run.

Maybe that observation explains why Blockstream is set on the two-layer redesign, even though the secod layer still does not have a viable design.  In the Lightning network, holders can get revenue from their holdings (as in a PoS coin) by serving as  intermediaries in a multi-hop path.  Presumably Blockstream investors include big holders, rather than potential users or traders...

Because this presupposes you know the exchange rate (edit - purchasing power) of a Bitcoin, and how much the fees will be.

If the value of a Bitcoin keeps up with halvings - as it has historically always done - then the value of the mining reward never drops, and no additional fees are ever needed for security.

You simply cannot make the claim you are attempting to make if you cannot accurately predict the exchange rate (edit: specifically, the purchasing power) of a bitcoin in the future (or more specifically the price of electricity priced in future bitcoins).

"And the man himself shows up. 

I'll be honest with you, there's no way for me to interact with you in a respectful way at this point, considering both your initial statement and the further information that's been revealed. 

But, as you deigned to descend to the level of us mere mortals (and insert yet more humblebragging into your response), let's break it down. 

You were asked: 

>Are you a programmer or have you studied computer science? I thought you were a politician.?

The answer that question is very simple: Yes, no, I am, thank you for recognizing me. 

You were explicitly **not** asked ""whether I was self-taught or had studied to learn to code"". Not at all. Moreover, your answer is entirely irrelevant. When asked a question, there is no world where the fact that, as a child, you did something maybe slightly related to the question is relevant. *The only reason you'd refer to the age at which you touched a computer for the first time, is simply to underline your successes.* 

>I started coding at age 8 and founded my first IT business at 16, with my first employee at 18.

That entire sentence is irrelevant unless you're trying to impress people who have limited experience. It's *textbook* bragging.

Moving forwards, there is absolutely no reason for you to contextualize the answer like this:

>I didn't study computer science at university, but I taught a few CompSci classes there as an assistant while studying engineering physics :)

Exactly what is this sentence except an excuse to say that you have a degree in Physics? This is actually strictly identical to random facebook personalities talking about how smart they are because they read an article on quantum mechanics. It's straight up irrelevant that you've assisted a class or two. Completely and totally irrelevant. 

The last portion of your original comment is specious shit as well:

>In 2006, I got tired of the political system not working and decided to hack it, which I succeeded in doing and kicked some offline-borns out of office (deservedly so). In some eyes, I guess that makes me a politician. I prefer ""net liberty activist running for office"". Politicians are people who lie on television about things that don't matter.

""Hack the political system""? That doesn't mean anything. You repeatedly failed to get elected and left your political party after it became clear that you couldn't freeload off the system. 

Now, let's get into your most recent comment, and your wikipedia page in general. 

>Rick says: Several news outlets are now running headline-size stories about me as an individual; Svenska Dagbladet will be the first to break the story tomorrow June 10, if anybody's interested in updating the bio. I won't update it myself, no matter how tempting. :-) I will share my personal motto prematurely to the SvD article, though: ""If you play by the rules, you will always lose."" This is because in most cases, the rules can be boiled down to ""STFD & STFU"": a lot of people let themselves be run by other people's expectations. If you let that happen, you become a perpetual victim of circumstances. The only way to win is to not play by the rules. 

What is that? That's you commenting facetiously on your own fucking wikipedia article feeding other people news articles to edit in on your behalf. Do you know what your 'motto' screams to me? It screams insecure manchild incapable of understanding why no one will let you play with them. Hint, it's because you're so full of yourself that you probably are incredibly unsufferable to be around. 

Let's recap your life, shall we?

Step 1: Change your name to Dick Falconwing because it makes you look cool. 

Step 2: Start an edgelord political party and then mooch off of people for 18 months because you couldn't even be bothered to get a real job. 

Step 3: Get kicked out of your political party because you tried to use it to pick up women. 

Step 4: Edit your own wikipedia article and ride the wave of a single moment of fame continuously, including right now. 

News Flash, Dick Greger Augustsson, you're 45, you have no career. You have no experience as a politician. Your last relevant international event was over four years ago. Your 15 minutes of fame are over. You have devolved into jerking yourself off on a public forum and attempting to build an image of yourself that's entirely inconsistent with reality. 

>(Also, when your life story does sound like that, it's hard to answer a question like that neutrally while still supplying enough fact to actually answer the question.)

Do you know what your life story really sounds like? Here you go:

>Kid who was always told he was so special, did a cool thing that one time. Finally, his moment of recognition came, when all the plebs would recognize his brilliance.

It must be everyone else who is wrong about this glorious man, dripping with overwhelming levels of intelligence and charm.

">  I guess, in the sense that predicting fuel prices for filling your car up next week is also ""unsolvable"".

No, it is completely different.   If logic does not tell you that, just watching the two situations should.

For one thing, you don't need ""a gasoline price estimator"".  You don't pay for gasoline one week in advance, without knowing the price.  When you pay, you know the price -- and, once you have paid, you will get what you paid for.  That is what ""market"" means for sane people.  

There are many other differences but that should suffice for now.

> some uncertainty about future fees

It is not *some* uncertainty, and it is not about *future* fees.  In the current regime, it is impossible to know how much fee one should pay **now** to get confirmation within any specified time.

> Decentralization has always been my highest priority

Centralization of mining is indeed a fatal flaw of bitcoin, but congested operation does not help *at all* to decrease or prevent it.

> Decentralization has always been my highest priority, as it should be for anyone else who understands why Bitcoin exists in the first place. 

I bet that I understand that better than you do.

I suppose that ""decentralization"" for you means having many ""allegedly full but non-mining"" relay nodes, sitting between simple clients and miners.  I have explained several times why those nodes not only do not contribute to the network, but in fact break completely its security and decentralization.

That is not just a theoretical risk.  UASF is essentially an attempt to use those nodes (and the skewed way by which they are found by clients) in order to force both simple clients and the miners to accept a change to the protocol that the self-appointed Central Planners want.  

If UASF goes through, bitcoin will have failed -- not just theoretically, but effectively.

Basically yes, in a practical sense.  

Note that the ""timestamping server"" required to solve the double-spend problem does not need to use the chronological order of arrival.  It needs only *choose* some ordering of the transactions, even if arbitrary.  Or, rather, it needs only choose *one* transaction among all those that spend a given UTXO, to be the only one confirmed.

That said, in practice many applications expect transactions to be confirmed more or less in the order that they were issued.  BitPay, for instance, used some private heuristic to decide whether an unconfirmed transaction was ""safe"" -- likely to be confirmed before any double-spend.  I suspect that the huge backlogs and the sort-by-fee policy pose a big problem for their heuristic. 

Payment channels also seem to depend on transactions being confirmed in roughly chronological order.";12;1;False;jstolfi;dj90un6;Bitcoin is no longer just annoying, but now literally unusable.

Moreover, any fee estimation method that is widely used will defeat itself.

This is so right, it isn't even ""like"" estimating the bid that would win a blind closed auction, it *literally is* estimating the bid that will win a blind closed auction.

This is why full blocks inherently break Bitcoin. 

Jstolfi, you might be able to help with this:

One way of describing Bitcoin is that it solves the Byzantine General's problem.  Another way Satoshi described his invention is as ""a global timestamping server.""  We can agree that, if there were such a thing as a global timestamping server upon whose timing everyone agreed, this would eliminate the need for blockchains (in Bitcoin's case, the blockchain is the timestamping server).

With the mempool being cleared every 10 minutes, Bitcoin *does* function as a global, decentralized timestamping server (albiet one with poor resolution at ~10mins).  Every txn in a block can be reasonably assumed to have been generated in the last 10 minutes.  This means that they are easily chronologically ordered, at least with 10 mins resolution.

I've realized for some years that ""blocks are supposed to be full"" is a strategic attack on Bitcoin's ability to timestamp, because with full blocks, it begins to be impossible to guess the order in which txns are received.  A txn in block 100 might have been received long after a txn in block 101.  With never-full blocks, this essentially never happens.

So we can see that full blocks breaks the timestamping functionality, but I have never really understood the full ramifications of this.  I am quite sure underneath this lies some sort of vulnerability that's being probed, and I intuitively feel this is a significant vulnerability, but I can't fully suss it out.  But it seems intuitive - the whole point of blockchains is to arrive at a consensus on the ordering of transactions, so if they become disordered, something has to give, right?
