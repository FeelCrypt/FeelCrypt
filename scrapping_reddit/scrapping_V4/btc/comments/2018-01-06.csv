"Ledger CEO here.

This is a low tech scam, not involving any tampering of the device (no need to do that). It relies on the fact that new users wouldn't find strange to have a predefined seed.

It is quite difficult to mitigate this kind of scams. Even with the warning on our apps page (https://www.ledgerwallet.com/apps) users are not paying a lot of attention when using the devices. Having a ""anti tamper seal"" wouldn't do much. In this case there wasn't even a plastic wrap on the casing and it didn't create any suspicion. Moreover, it is trivial to duplicate any cardbox or anti tampering seal.

Our actions regarding this scam are the following:

- we have contacted all victims of the scams and we are creating a task force with our General Counsel and a jut hired Trust & Safety Manager . We'll help file formal criminal complaint and will do everything we can to bring the scammer(s) to justice
- we are implemting extra safety protocols in our firmware to notify the apps in case a PIN has been changed or a seed has been restored to display warnings and reminders about the importance of having self generating the seed
- we are adding more enphasis on seed safety management on our FAQs and tutorials

This is just the beginning. With an incoming trillion dollars crypto market cap and millions of new uses worldwide, low tech and high tech scams will be more and more present. It is our global responsability as hardware wallet makers to prevent any counterfeit (for instance through cryptographic attestation) and enforce safety protocols ensuring the user is aware he must have generated the seed on her own.";361;17;False;murzika;ds9t33k;WARNING: Brutal scam.

"It's the fundamental flaw of all crypto, and the fundamental reason why the banking system isn't going away.

Because that's what banks *are*. Fundamentally, an insured place where people can store their most theft-prone assets in a way that's risk-free to the individual. Banks evolved because people *needed to store their gold somewhere*.

This is not a solvable problem for digital currencies. The technical wherewithal to truly securely store digital currency is beyond 99% of users, because practically no one makes their own CPUs and writes their own wallet software. And if someone does, there's always kidnapping and torture for ransom.

The traceability of traditional currency and reversibility of transactions *is a good thing*. What we need is for us to build trustworthy governments and institutions, not to give up and run away into crypto when we fail at it.

It doesn't really have to be as complicated as that.  One solution for long term storage or for savings is paper wallets.  You can simply download a wallet generator, take your computer offline, print it offline to a hardwired printer, and put it in a locked box hidden away.  Just keep the public key (the address) handy and any time you want to deposit funds to that address you can do so (you do not need the hard copy, just a copy of the public key).  Whenever you want to eventually spend those funds, you can just use a mobile wallet like breadwallet or mycelium to import the private key by scanning the QR code on the paper wallet.  That will sweep all of the funds onto your mobile device, from which you can spend it or send it to any other address.  I recommend laminating paper wallets and keeping in a fire-proof safe.;1;0;False;sph44;ds9xz37;WARNING: Brutal scam.

"Just as we diversify our portfolio, we can diversify our security.  How about this as a solution for paper wallets and/or seeds?

Then hand deliver it (or include it in a mailed package) to a select few trusted people.  They don’t need to know what’s in the card - just that it’s a self-reminder that you might ask for one day and that they should keep it in a safe/secure place. 

In the off chance you need one, you can get it from the closest person, or have one of the others mail the card back to you (or they can open the card and send a digital photo if you trust them - and if you transfer to a new wallet afterward).

By spreading out the recovery info it has ensured that weather, fire, water, kids, pets, etc will not destroy the info.

In April 2015, the Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Company, an underground safe deposit facility in London's Hatton Garden area, was burgled. The total stolen may have a value of up to £200 million, the incident has been called the ""largest burglary in English legal history.""

The heist was planned and carried out by four elderly men who were experienced thieves, all of whom pleaded guilty and received prison sentences in March 2016. Four other men were also tried on suspicion of involvement; three were found guilty and sent to prison, while the fourth was cleared.

"A riddle still let's someone solve it. The best way would be to set up an nTimeLock contract. You could for example give people you trust an unencrypted Bitcoin wallet with no BTC on it but have your own BTC wallet with a password only you know and then have a nTimeLock contract to say send all those Bitcoin after 10 years to the unencrypted one unless the contract is canceled. This way you don't need to trust anyone with the funds but if you die well in 10 years your family gets the money.

"> This is awful to see but is it actually that bad to buy one from a third party?

It's probably ok to buy directly from major 3rd party retailers (Walmart.com, Amazon.com), but not from independent sellers like ""Joe-Discount-Wallets"" who sell on Amazon.

But even when people try to go to the official website, they can get scammed.

Exodus.io has a great multi-currency software wallet.

Earlier this year, a scammer had setup ExodusWallet.io to scam people.  And for a while, Google actually let him place ads leading to his scam website.  So some careless people searched for Exodus wallet, accidentally clicked on the scam Google ad, and got sent to a realistic mirror scam website.

Yes, these things happen.  My mom once clicked on a Google ad, without realizing that it was an ad.

"At some point you will want to sell or spend your coins.  If the computer that you use to sign transactions is connected to the internet and has malware in it, your bitcoins can be stolen.  So you must sign your transactions on a separate computer, never connected to the internet; and then transfer the signed transactions to your normal computer with a pen drive or some other non-internet medium.

Even then you must watch out.  Malware on that ""air-gapped"" computer could leak the private key in the signed transaction.  Or, if you use that computer to create your key/address pairs, the malware might tamper with the random number generator to produce keys that are easy to guess.

A hardware wallet basically replaces that second computer.  Since it runs only one piece of software (the firmware), it is less likely to have malware.  (But not impossible.  The manufacturer or someone in the shipping chain could replace the hardware and/or firmware with a malicious version.)";37;3;False;jstolfi;ds9h5pi;WARNING: Brutal scam.

"They're all secure from a hardware standpoint... the problem wasn't the third party buy or even technically device itself.  It was the scam seed card and already setup device.

Ledger's aren't supposed to have pre-set keys.  The Key generation is part of the initial setup process.  Anyone buying from a  third party can avoid this scam and still use the device if they reset the hardware wallet and create new keys from scratch that only they have.  That's the true lesson here.

True.  But let's say you advise a cheap ass friend (i have several) to buy a ledger for example.  Then being cheap they go on eBay to save a few bucks because to them the 100$ price tag is too high.  You can see how the naive could fall for this and I feel for the guy.  Many of us take for granted being super secure about our crypto and even then sweat it making transfers etc.  The average joe new to crypto is probably not going to review best practices and thoroughly review exactly how the device works before simply reading the enclosed instructions and proceeding to use.

"Police subpoenas PayPal. PayPal tells police the names and addresses of other potential victims. Police asks other victims, recovers identical fake seed card, with fingerprints of scammer in one case.

Judge is convinced, beyond *reasonable* doubt, that the seed cards didn't make it into the sealed packages out of the scammers desire to help his customers simplify their setup. Judge sends scammer to jail.

Scammer doesn't reveal where he hid the coins, so he spends 4 instead of 2 years in jail, and has a civil judgement (preponderance of evidence, so really easy) against him to repay (but doesn't officially have any money so people don't get their money back, although he mysteriously seems be able to support a serious partying habit despite having no job where his wages could be garnished).

One night, a masked person knocks on the scammers door, pushes the scammer inside once he opens, and retrieves the location and credentials of the coins, now worth millions, using a rubber hose and a $5 wrench. The scammer realizes that this was a bad idea.

Edit: since Mr. Rubber Hose isn't happy with the amount discovered, he continues the extraction process. The scammer realizes that this was a really bad idea, because although he has already given up everything, the masked maniac isn't going to believe him and is picking up the wrench again.

In the next episode of Murder Mystery: was it one of the victims, a jailmate listening to the scammer's bragging while drunk on prison toilet wine, or an unrelated person who heard about the case and decided to get at the scammer's riches? And what happened with the scammer? Will police find his mangled body in the woods, or is he still alive, somewhere in a basement, being fed bread and water and asked a simple, yet impossible question every day, tied to a pipe and beaten with another?

Of course, this is just one possible outcome. Maybe the scammer will turn themselves in, maybe they'll confess when police comes knocking, maybe they'll return the coins hoping to reduce the eagerness of the prosecution to avoid getting caught, maybe they'll get away with it, brag, then end up in the basement tied to a pipe, maybe they'll return the coins when caught to get a milder sentence (and avoid the rubber hose), ...

Most criminals think they're smart and that they thought of everything. Almost all of them are wrong, but some get lucky that the police gets bored/too busy with other stuff before finding the mistakes they made. Given how much stuff was involved here (eBay, PayPal, postal shipping, physical items, producing fake scratch cards - is that [color](https://www.google.com/search?q=color+printer+yellow+dots) in the logo?) it'd take a damn careful criminal to cover all their tracks.

"Sorry that this happened to you. For future reference, keep in mind that those words represent the private key. Since it's a private key, it's something that only you should know and you should never share with anyone else. 

I know that the device included a 'scratch off' card to make you think that the words were a secret, but that still means that someone had to input those 'scratch words' into the Ledger device. Thus, by definition the words are no longer private and are therefore useless. This principle of no one else know your seed words would apply even if you thought that Ledger themselves did this--ie. you should not trust even Ledger. So, if any hardware or software manufacturer gives you those seed words or asks you to send the words to them for 'backup' then by definition there is something wrong.

In summary, seed words should always be generated by you and you alone--not by any hardware manufacturer or any software vendor.

If someone is using a hardware wallet and does not understand what the role of the seed is, it is very likely, unfortunately, that at some point the funds would have been lost anyways.  Example, someone taking a backup of their seed by taking a photo of it, or scanning it on an internet connected scanner.  Or recovering their wallet on a compromised computer (ie 99% of windows computers are probably compromised).

The only thing that I'm paranoid about is who I buy from, so I waited four long months to get my Ledger from Ledger. There have been a lot of people who bought Ledgers that are legit from third party retailers, but for something that's making scammers circle like vultures, I wanted mine coming directly from the source. 

Good luck in getting your money back, although I fear it's going to be an uphill battle, and I'm guessing the scammers may be working in a different country which is going to add another level of bureaucracy.

"XRP a shitcoin?! Oh come on! Give me a break! 😂You know that Ethereum founder (yes, Vitalik Buterin himself) wanted to work for Ripple before creating Ethereum, right?

I wonder if XRP will indeed compete with Ethereum in the future when the smart contracts (Codius) are implemented on the XRP protocol. Time will tell I guess! I think they can work together.
