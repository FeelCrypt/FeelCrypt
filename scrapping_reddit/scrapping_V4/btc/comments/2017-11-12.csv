"You need a wallet address to send or receive coin.  

The tipping uses a bot, which maintains an account for each tipper/tippee.  To start tipping, you send coin to the bot.  Those coins go in your account with the bot, and you can withdraw them whenever you want.  

When you send a tip, the bot just creates a new account for the recipient and transfers the coins (off chain, in its internal database) from the sender's account to the recipient's account.  So I could withdraw my coins to my own wallet (on chain).  You do this by PMing the bot.  ";36;1;False;SirEDCaLot;dpp5itu;Bought my first bitcoin for $6 in 2011.

"Quite true.  My investing strategy is not coupled to my excitement or lack thereof.  

I worry about the long term health of BTC though.  Right now I don't see any answer to scaling.  If more companies adopt SegWit that will help, for a while, but we'll have the same problem in another year (and the developers don't seem to consider it a problem).   If financial activity starts to move to BCH, then Bitcoin is in trouble.  ";9;0;False;SirEDCaLot;dpp5azt;Bought my first bitcoin for $6 in 2011. Sold my last bitcoin for $6227 in 2017.

"FWIW I haven't sold anything, as I said at the end I'm still considering my options.  Until anything changes, I am still buying BTC and ETH on a weekly basis (and will soon be buying BCH too).  I've got a bunch of BCH on my holdings from before the fork.  Obviously it hurts to watch the price tick away (another $50 since my last post).  But I am in for the long haul.  If I sell anything, it's going in another crypto, not fiat.  

And you're right we don't know the answer.  This is all a grand experiment, it's never been done before.  Maybe Core team is right and on chain scaling is a bad idea in the long run.  I don't know.  

But what is bothering me is not the price, it's the attitude.  I got into BTC years ago because I liked the censorship-resistant honey badger future of money.  I'm sad now because BTC (and to a larger part, the BTC community) has become the censorship-supporting defeatist alarmist group that calls any proposal not from Core a 'hostile attack', pushes crap like UASF (which would have caused chaos), is happy to censor and ban people who push ideas they don't agree with and DDoS nodes that spread new proposals, and while the developers mostly insulate themselves from this, they also don't speak out against it.  

On a more practical note, what BTC has right now is momentum.  There is one simple action that could flip that- Coinbase and BitPay start trading and accepting BCH.  If that happens, I think it's game on again- BCH will once again be a useful currency for transactions.  If that happens, then Bitcoin's future basically rests with Lightning- if Lightning doesn't work, then people will quickly move on from BTC to BCH simply because it scales.

"> Teach them the biggest lesson in trading and that is emotions stay out.

Hodler not a trader here. His opinion is based on fundamentals, not emotion. Although he expresses sadness in his post, his reason to divest from btc is because it's not working per the fundamentals that he believes in, as it did when he first discovered it. 

> What everyone should have done was hold both and stop thinking we know everything. 

Yes when there's uncertainty. But with 2x cancellation there is no potential path forward. The scaling proposals from Core are stalling strategies, to distract from the elephant in the room. Even if we're wrong about that there has been a clear shift denouncing its use as cash. No-one knows everything but at some point you've gotta make decisions based on the information you have at the time. 

The fundamentals say to sell. The only factor is derivatives on top of btc may push the price higher before they realise the emperor has no clothes. So DCAing may be right thing...but it still feels like catching a falling knife.

"I tend to agree with OP and the reasonable part of the community here. But the price manipulation we see today in BCH is extremely worrying, as it suggests a lot of centralization and a few hands having way too much power. I still cannot understand what has hapenned in the last 48hours and nobody can justify that it is because of market adoption or sudden enlightment of 4 milion Koreans. 

I am very cautious about all this. I was more convinced of the arguments for BCH two days ago than now. And I don't see anybody around here questioning these events, which worries me even more.

Therefore let me announce: the XVA Coin will have its pre-ICO starting Nov. 30th 2017 at www.xva-coin.com. Just another shitty Altcoin like Litecoin or Bitcoin Cash or Bitcoin Gold...

Let‘s promote Fiat to Crypto and let’s stop bashing each other!

Blame the non mineable cryptos like Ripple.

The Crypto War /btc versus /Bitcoin is over!

Both will continue to prosper, because of Fiat to crypto.

Now it is time to support Litecoin by buying some with your USD or EUR (Fiat in terms of EUR, USD, JPY, CHF, SEK, etc) or support new ideas of freedom, which combine different values in different countries aka ICO.

"I think Mr. Charles is right.  

I got excited about BTC years ago because it finally offered the possibility of fully decentralized finance- no need for Wells Fargo or JP Morgan or Goldman Sachs.  Normal people and businesses could transact without needing anyone else's help or approval.  

For me, an American with a good job and credit, that is mildly interesting.  For someone in a country with shitty economic policy / corrupt financial system, or who cannot get a bank account for whatever reason, it's *revolutionary*.  Just as the Internet took away the borders of communication, Bitcoin can take away the borders of money.  

So I bought and I started HODLing.  I told my favorite companies to please start accepting BTC.  I told others to get into Bitcoin because it's the future.  I laughed with everybody as we said 'TO THE MOON!!1' because we all knew that's where we were going.  I looked at companies like Visa and laughed, because they were the past and we were the future.  We were *excited*.  

Then the bubble popped.  I was told I can't use 0-conf to pay for coffee because nobody should use 0-conf (including the people who were using it).  I was told I shouldn't send microtransactions on Bitcoin.  I was told that gambling on Bitcoin is spam and should be filtered out.  I was told that I shouldn't use Bitcoin for small day to day transactions because I'm wasting block space and I should use Visa instead.  I was told that paying $5 per transaction is a good thing and the network is working as designed.  The companies I told to start accepting Bitcoin mostly stopped accepting Bitcoin.  

Right now, this is not the rocket I wanted to be on.  I wanted the rocket that goes TO THE MOON!!1, not the rocket that's too small to even make orbit let alone hit the moon.  

I want the old days back- the days when we'd tackle problems together with enthusiasm rather than defeatism.  The days where we'd boldly innovate rather than being paralyzed for months/years by fear of technical problems.  The days when we boasted we were impossible to stop or censor, rather than fear [getting banned for promoting the 'wrong' proposal](https://i.imgur.com/B1WlwOM.jpg).  The days when voting for proposals was called decentralized democracy in action, not a hostile attack.  

I don't think those days are returning to Bitcoin, not anytime soon, not with the history they've created in the last few years (especially /r/Bitcoin).  And at minimum, it would require a change in moderation policy.  Don't get me wrong- I hope Bitcoin succeeds, I hope Lightning works as well as promised, and I hope the Core devs can build something really cool.  

But I only see that *excited* attitude in altcoins.  Go talk to an Ethereum fan and you'll hear all about innovation, smart contracts, ICOs and new tokens, and the future of investing.  While we fight each other, those guys are innovating.  I want to do that again.  I want to stop fighting enemies within the walls, and worse people who think I'm the enemy because I want my coffee paid in Bitcoin, and get back to innovating.  

Maybe, hopefully, Bitcoin Cash will hold the future I'm looking for.  I really hope it does.  But for now, I'm losing excitement for Bitcoin.  I see the mempool filling up and the user experience going to shit and the price dropping and I don't see anyone with the power to fix it even considering it to be a major problem.  

So, for the first time in several years, I am considering actually SELLing at least some of my BTC, most likely to buy BCH and ETH.

"If you think any of these currencies are here for the long term then it makes no sense to just buy them unless you actually have a use for them.

Currency is not a good investment. Currency doesn't do anything except facilitate the trade of things that are actually valuable. Currency only increases in value if there is insufficient supply of currency to meet the demand for currency.

What you appear to be interested in is a speculative asset (i.e. something you can by for X and then sell for 20x a short time later).

Speculative assets by definition make bad currencies because no one wants to spend them, everyone wants to sit on them and wait for them to go up in value. This is one of the reasons the entire world switched off the gold standard. It's also the reason nothing like bitcoin is ever going to become a widely adopted

The idea that deflationary currencies are somehow superior to inflationary currencies has never been proven. Almost every country in the world had a chance to keep hold of gold currency instead of switching to fiat, but none did. If deflation of the money supply actually conferred an advantage then surely at least one country in the world would have liked to retain that advantage.

But it doesn't. Money is only useful for allowing people to trade things of value, and a constantly shrinking supply of money (relative to total goods and services in the economy) does not allow people to trade more than a system that slowly increases the supply of money to match the value of goods and services in the economy. Shrinking the money supply discourages trade because the rarer money gets the more valuable it becomes so the greater the incentive is to not spend it.";1;0;False;suninabox;dpprvj9;Bought my first bitcoin for $6 in 2011.

Not just the Chinese firewall although that is an issue. The basic problem is that miners have latency between them.

"**Eternal September**

Eternal September or the September that never ended is Usenet slang for a period beginning in September 1993, the month that Internet service provider America Online began offering Usenet access to its many users, overwhelming the existing culture for online forums. The influx in Usenet users was also indirectly caused by the aggressive direct mailing campaign by AOL Chief Marketing Officer Jan Brandt in order to beat out CompuServe and Prodigy, which most notably involved distributing millions of floppy disks and CD-ROMs with free trials of AOL.

Before then, Usenet was largely restricted to colleges and universities. Every September, a large number of incoming freshmen would acquire access to Usenet for the first time, taking time to become accustomed to Usenet's standards of conduct and ""netiquette"". After a month or so, these new users would either learn to comply with the networks' social norms or tire of using the service.

"> I guess I'm not sure what this means.  I guess I'm dumb. :/

Not at all. : )

Cryptocurrencies are *weird*. They are not at all what you have been used to your entire life.

Good news is, you don't need to know much to use them safely. And you'll get used to it very quickly.

#In a Nutshell

A **wallet** is a collection of **addresses**. Each **address** is made up of a **public key** and a **private key**. 

**Public Key** - This is, as the name implies, the public part of an address that you share with other people. If I wanted you to send me some money I might say ""Send bitcoin to this address: [1BPr81BrFQZgHPwE1y5nZwBs7szduCYbGf](https://blockchain.info/address/1BPr81BrFQZgHPwE1y5nZwBs7szduCYbGf)"". That's just a random one I picked from the last block that was mined. As you can see it is *completely* public. But pseudo anonymous; you've no idea who owns that address.

So, an address is the equivalent of a bank account number, that someone can send money to. And like a bank account it needs a key that only the owner can use it. Normally that would be a user account and password. In bitcoin it is a...

**Private Key** - This is, as the name implies, private. Never share this with anyone. This is the key that allows you to *spend* from the public address. Whoever has this private key can spend from the corresponding address.

**Wallets** - Now, we say ""wallet"" but I prefer ""bank"". The reason being it actually is a bank. Literally. When you create a wallet you just created a bank that can create accounts and transfer money internationally. Again, literally, an international bank. The wallet/bank software auto creates a (huge) list of accounts, based on a ""seed phrase"". Each account/address is a public-private key pair, as I explained just above. 

Now, you can just use the one account/address for *all* your transactions ever, but to make bitcoin transactions even more hard to track wallets will automatically send transactions to new address/accounts. This all happens automatically.

I've gone off-topic, but you'll come across the above again and again, and it is pretty much ""how to use bitcoin"" for the average person. You don't need to know more to just use it.

**Wallets** contains **addresses**, and each address has a **public key** and a **private key**.

#Bitcoin Cash

Now, what the hell happened with the BCH fork, and how can you understand it? Let me try : )

The currency bitcoin runs on a protocol called Bitcoin. They are two things, but inseparable. The Bitcoin protocol includes a blockchain that contains *every transaction ever*, to every address, ever. It is now 9 years old and about 300GB in size. It *is* the bitcoin ledger.

When Bitcoin Cash (BCH) was made, ""forked"", it was copied from Bitcoin (BTC). Literally copied. Every transaction ever on the btc blockchain was copied and saved as the bch blockchain. As of August 1.

So say I have a spreadsheet that is keeping track of all the money I owe you, and you owe me, for whatever reason. If I make a copy of that spreadsheet all the IOUs are now on both copies. Exactly the same happened with the BCH fork.

So, if you had any addresses on the BTC chain with money in it (unspent transactions) those same addresses were copied to the BCH chain. And are still there.

If you have your **private keys** to those addresses, then you have the **private keys** to those addresses on the BCH chain.

Download [Electron](https://electroncash.org) which is a wallet specifically for the Bitcoin Cash blockchain. Generate a wallet using the seed phrase from your BTC wallet. Presto! You have Bitcoin Cash.

You can trade on exchanges like [www.hitbtc.com](http://hitbtc.com). They only require an email address so you can join and trade instantly (because you're not trading dollars or yen or euros, just crypto).

#Don't Send BTC to BCH

They are different blockchains. It's akin to you putting money in an envelope and posting to an email address. Different message systems.

#Fin
Now I've written all that I realised I should have asked you which wallet you are using. I assume you are using a wallet on your PC or phone??? If not you won't know your seed phrase, nor your private keys.

I highly recommend setting aside a small amount of money and playing with it. Send it to and from some addresses. Make a few wallets and practice. Learn how to backup. Learn how to make and use a paper wallet. It's all pretty interesting in itself. The tech is really cool, for example I sent my bitcoin to a painting for cold storage, hack that.

"Oversimplification. If it was that simple, the Federal Reserve would not exist, and we would still use the gold standard. It can take decades to hundreds of years for an unsustainable paradigm to collapse, such as the debt bubble. And let's face it, people are pretty stupid, so they'll believe whatever is posted in /r/bitcoin, because that's literally the extent of their critical thought: ""/r/bitcoin is like... the full name. I choose this one. Hey guys! New to crypto. What's up?"" - ""Bitcoin is king."" - ""Fuck yeaaaahhhhhh! Paying a meal's worth of monetary value for a transaction that hopefully won't take more than a couple of days, fuckkkkkk yeahhhhh.""

Crypto is full of shitkids who couldn't even tell you how a signature works. Keep that in mind. They hear about crypto, they buy whatever has claimed the Bitcoin name, they try some alts, and if they don't make money on it, they stick to Bitcoin. All they know is that they have Bitcoin. They know they have to copy/paste a series of characters to access, send and receive their BTC, but that's about it. Very, very few of them actually bother to learn how it works. And they keep hearing ""Bitcoin is king"" from the cult they unwittingly joined (lured by the series of letters: ""BITCOIN [nothing after]""), so the hoax keeps going.

So the first problem is that people will not necessarily support the best solution, they will support some image that has been planted in their heads by their peers and the people behind it.

The second problem is that both strategies rely on the support of a common resource, namely miners. Miners will come to BCH when the price is rising steadily yet fast enough to make it a more lucrative bet, which it won't be until the majority of people stop buying the inferior coin at higher prices. We depend on the ability of our fellow crypto investors to get a grasp of the situation and actually break free from cognitive dissonance.

That requires action on our part. It requires that we illuminate them.

"Honestly, Bitcoin is probably the most difficult technology to get into in the world. That's because the technology relies heavily on the actions and psychology of people. It is a highly dynamic system of a million moving parts.

The community debates are so difficult to follow because they a dispersed across hundreds of actions and hundreds and thousands of posts on many different social media sites.

The only reason I, and others on r/btc, have been able to keep up with the situation is spending way WAY too much time on social media following the situation, AND having a good understanding of how the network functions. The people on r/bitcoin (and r/btc) often are only seeing a few pieces of the puzzle and are intepreting the small amount of information they have and expecting it to explain the bigger picture. Often that information has been directly handed down to them by others and they have not been able to assess the situation properly themselves. What they don't see is the hundreds of other pieces that are required to put the full puzzle together. I actually don't think anyone has all the pieces. Some have more than others, and that's fine.

The reason why the debate has become so fierce though is that one side of the debate has been actively hiding many of the pieces of the puzzle from people and saying they don't exist. This is why people from our side are so angry. Not only that, but when we refused to be manipulated and abused for simply holding an opinion (one that literally everyone held in 2013), we were kicked out from our home at r/bitcoin.

"The problem is ignorance of end users. When the majority of end users only know that they're ""buying Bitcoin,"" and only know little bits and pieces of how it works, they are easily manipulated. In that state, the market's popular vote is controlled by the people with the biggest marketing budget and political power (though legally binding contracts and whatnot), not by the merits of the technology, or even the interests of the people behind it.

Bitcoin Core is a very profitable (for the large mining pools) scheme that intentionally extorts you into paying higher and higher fees to get your transaction processed. It cannot go one forever, because it's a bubble, and in no way does it serve you as a user. Bitcoin Core was a very well-organized heist, and it's time we take the power back from the men who duped the majority into calling Bitcoin ""Bitcoin Cash,"" thus locking in the illusionary image of being ""king.""

"> How do we make bitcoin cash succeed and get rid of the toxic fake bitcoin?

1) Sell our Bitcoins for Bitcoin Cash. All you can afford to lose (I'm not going all in, but I'm like 70:30 in Cash:Segwit).

2) Keeping the average user about what a shit coin Bitcoin is (both from a technological point of view and governance)

3) **getting the hashrate**. Segwit Coin is doomed without proper hashrate.

4) Spread the use of Bitcoin Cash. Till Steam and other shops accept Segwit coins we'll be the ""second coin"".

Mind you, for me Segwit coin and Cash can coexist, but we need to sustain BCH.

"Congratulations on seeing the light. 

Now, we continue to fight. We vote with what power we have - miners by supporting the cash chain, users and investors by trading their BTC for Bitcoin Cash, driving the prices down and up, respectively.

I am not a large whale by any means but my contribution has still been significant thus far. **If you help even just one other person see the light, you have already done a great service for this community and for our species in general.**

"It can work. The only reason bitcoin had a block size limit is because the network was very small when it was implemented, and Satoshi realized that the network could be attacked by creating very large blocks that the network was unable to handle at the time. It was meant to be a temporary patch. There is no reason to limit the block size to 1MB, unless you want to choke the network and force people to use your layer 2 solution (which means more money for you). This is precisely what Blockstream has done. Look at the mempool.

Layer 2 solutions would work fine on BCH, and will likely come at some point. But the immediate issue was the block size.

We miners like the few extra coins but realise it's only great for the short term profits. In reality we know it needs to be sorted properly or we'll mine all the remaining bitcoins too quickly and ruin the distribution schedule. The way Bitcoin works is that all the coins are mined over 100 years. As the reward halves every 2 years it should get harder and harder to mine. Therefore causing deflation on the coin rather than inflation. Eventually in 100 years when all the coins have been mined there'll be 10 billion users all paying 1 cent per transaction and that will be plenty reward for miners to keep the network running.;1;1;False;Cjx78p14d0zl1m73;dpoxfe3;54.33% hash power achieved.

"Disclaimer: I may be biased. I side with Bitcoin Cash.

First, there is intent: members of the Bitcoin Core team have indicated that they plan to take it in a ""digital gold"" direction as opposed to cash. Proponents of this vision make light of the idea of using cryptocurrency to, say, buy coffee. This is expressly against the intended design of Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer digital currency. The mission of Bitcoin Cash is to correct course back to being a digital currency.

In terms of technology, the following is relevant:

- BTC currently has very high network congestion, and thus high transaction fees. A backlog is forming. This is due to an arbitrary 1MB block size limit, which is literally impeding on-chain scaling (as in, scaling Bitcoin itself by processing more transactions per block). The purported rationale for keeping the 1MB limit varies, but the gist of it is that larger blocks are supposedly harder for users to store (as any user running a full node needs to keep an entire copy of the blockchain), and/or they are less secure (although no evidence or even hypothesis has been offered to show this), and/or the contention that we should use an external layer to scale Bitcoin instead of allowing Bitcoin itself to grow. The latter point is the most significant one, and has been stated publicly: that scaling Bitcoin should be done via external solutions. Some Core members have also said that high transaction fees are actually desirable.

tl;dr: Pro-BTC people believe Bitcoin shouldn't grow enough to support a cash-like volume of transactions, and that high fees are OK, maybe even desirable in order to encourage a shift to 3rd parties / sidechains, where the actual scaling should happen. This is more similar to gold, because gold is a security and not cash (you can't buy coffee with gold), and so you tend to access it via gatekeepers, and the transactions you would make would be closer to a wire transfer (e.g. simple transfer, or investment) than a transfer to buy coffee. You could supposedly still buy coffee using Bitcoin only as a backend, but you'd be doing this in the Lightning Network, which is unreleased (and always 18 months away), and has unknown characteristics (you may find yourself dealing directly with a company, and being subject to their own policies, rather than having the assurances of blockchain technology).


- BTC has implemented Segregated Witness (SegWit), which is a controversial update, to say the least. SegWit is very complicated, so I won't quite do it justice here, but essentially it's a fix for transaction malleability. Malleability must be fixed in order to do off-chain scaling. SegWit is Core's solution for this. It also uses a very convoluted and complicated ""block weight"" system for calculating block size, thus resulting in larger blocks in certain relatively uncommon situations, and so Core sometimes claims it's also a scaling solution. SegWit introduces complexity and several security vulnerabilities. More importantly, it goes against the idea that Bitcoin can be viewed as a chain of digital signatures (https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6vmvfp/we_define_an_electronic_coin_as_a_chain_of/). The entire thing is controversial, but Bitcoin Cash proponents deem it unnecessary. Redirecting the growth of Bitcoin to external solutions turns Bitcoin into more of a long-term value store (i.e. similar to gold) rather than a high liquidity asset (cash).


- BTC has RBF (replace by fee). This means that if you send a BTC transaction and it gets stuck for a long time, you can override it by re-issuing the transaction with a higher fee (thus canceling the original stuck transaction). It's thus more likely to go through. A consequence of this is that a merchant can not rely on unconfirmed transactions, since they can be canceled. Bitcoin Cash removes RBF, and so even unmined/unconfirmed transactions may be accepted by merchants on a provisional basis (think of ordering a coffee, and not having to wait until the transaction gets mined).


- Conveniently, many of the BTC developers are employed by a company (Blockstream) that sells sidechain solutions. What a coincidence.


- Core employs blatant censorship on r/Bitcoin and other forums. They also engage in malicious behavior, such as BTC supporters registering r/bcash and trying to claim that Bitcoin Cash is called ""Bcash"" and is just an altcoin unrelated to Bitcoin.


In light of the above, Bitcoin Cash is very simple to understand:

- Mission = decentralized digital cash, not digital gold
- 8MB block size limit in order to allow a much higher rate of transactions to be processed (= lower fees and your transaction doesn't get stuck), so the actual blockchain can scale up (whereas BTC's current development team literally does not want Bitcoin itself to support more growth)
- No SegWit
- No RBF


Bitcoin Cash negatives: it has a fragile difficulty adjustment system, which has caused some pretty harsh swings in the block mining rate (periods with very few blocks mined, followed by periods of very fast mining). This will be fixed in the next few days, via hard fork. That's the only negative I can think of.";3;0;False;nimblecoin;dpp86dl;54.33% hash power achieved.

Thing is, the FUD has been totally unwarranted. The hardforks have brought only more freedom for more market participants to get what they want, as well as to give a clear signal to the miners.

"That is unlikely unless BTC's difficulty oscillates as well, which doesn't happen. Since BTC's difficulty rarely changes, the BCH difficulty algorithm is essentially in the driver's seat. If the BCH price were to fluctuate wildly for some other reason, then there might be a lot of quick switching temporarily (that's true regardless of which DAA is in place), but with the new DAA in place, I doubt it could last very long.

I don't consider myself a hacker, but I have stolen passwords/etc in the past. I agree that opt-out is an important feature for users that don't have proper smartphone-like systems. And I believe that not using untrusted nodes is important as well. As long as you generate unique passwords for every site, that enables some security. Brute forcing is a last resort and shouldn't be relied on from an attack method. Unfortunately though, targeted attacks exist. You're 'trusted' nodes can easily be compromised in some fashion, [hardware solutions](https://www.keelog.com/hardware_keyboard_logger.html) exist which can be soldered directly into whatever brand keyboard you use, including video loggers. And thats before we discuss software/rootkit/etc logging.

Yes, only the ones bold enough to engage in fork arbitrage really have a stake in the outcome. Note how Bitcoin=BCH+BTC remains virtually unchanged at $7650. Hodlers unaffected. Arbitrageurs are killing each other in the trenches, leading to the more prescient ones coming out with more power and the less prescient ones less. Basically **the average hodler intelligence in Bitcoin (weighted by the value of their holdings) is increasing by leaps and bounds today**, while hodlers just yawn. The end result should be happy hodlers as the overall price rises to reflect this dramatic increase in average intelligence. ;2;0;False;ForkiusMaximus;dpp646g;54.33% hash power achieved.

"90% of the people I️ know who happened on bitcoin in the last 12 months (which is a huge % of the current ecosystem) are completely lost and don’t know what to think. Because the thought control and censorship over there has them convinced BCH is the brainchild of Demon Man, Roger Ver.  

They have no idea how we got to this place. And they’re not allowed to learn. They weren’t there for years and years, as people politely begged Core to do something, and got laughed at, or ignored. I sat here and watched it day after day. Slowly getting more and more angry. Knowing this day would come.

The information control has done a ton of damage.  I am in a few groups with tons of stock investors that switched to crypto, and they all just believe what they’re told from over there. They mock BCH, because they think that’s the narrative.  They have no awareness of how this thing actually played out over the last seven years. 

That’s why I wrote my [tweet](https://twitter.com/bittburger/status/929419040816209920). The rewriting of history that has happened has done incredible damage.  ";14;2;False;BitttBurger;dpphwhr;This tweet aged well 😂😂;7ce2kh;https://i.redd.it/pbntrshbyxgz.png

Sure thing.

But the validation part, that what defines the chain, should mostly (except blocksize of course) stay as it is IMO. Unless a major feature *warrants* a change.

"> Can you explain In what ways you think BCH is more popular than ETH?

It's Bitcoin. End of story. I actually invested in ETH in early 2016 (price around $10) and just holding it, so I'm not crapping on it.

But as one comparison to bitcoin payments, ETH can only do one type of transaction. A to B. There's no (A, B, C --> D) or (A --> B, C, D) type of transactions. That is a huge weakness IMO.

I think people put way too much stock in the market cap cock measuring. Face it, all crypto is right now is emotional speculation. Until there's an actual scaled blockchain with real world utility at scale none of this stuff matters. It's all just manipulation, a chain of pump and dumps. Sure BCH is nice, currently able to handle more transactions than BTC, but not nearly enough to handle mainstream adoption, they need a multi-faceted scaling roadmap to reach that not just big blocks, I haven't seen a consensus roadmap on how that's going to be accomplished. But yet, billions pouring in as I type this. You can try to ride the hype waves as they pump from ETH, to BTC , to BCH, to ETC, and hope you time out your jumps and don't get caught in the riptide when the manipulators move, or you can place fundamental bets on who's going to get to that scaled implementation first and best, but the 2017 market cap really only matters for whales and plankton.  ;9;3;False;KingLeo23;dpp5sz9;Bitcoin Cash Overtakes Ethereum in Market Cap!;7cd6um;https://i.redd.it/u8bjzdp5vgxz.png

"> Now I think it's 70 % likely that Bitcoin Cash will take the number one market cap spot within a few days and then keep that spot for the foreseeable future.

I think that's unlikely as I don't see this BCH rally stretching that far, I think we'd be lucky to break much more than $2000 short-term, but then will begin a war of attrition that could last a year, but I think BCH will prove the winner there. We'll know by the 2020 halvening who has won. 

The key will be if BCH can differentiate itself, VISIBLY, before Wall St piles in with their money. If we can get on their radar when they are doing their due diligence, then the obvious value proposition of BCH over BTC will make a lot of them think twice, and smart money will begin pouring into BCH rather than BTC.

In fact, I expect this could make the difference for BCH. This fight will ultimately be judged by price differential.

The BTC partisans can be delusional about which coin is the 'real bitcoin' right up to the point where miners abandon them, their transactions don't complete anymore, and the real kicker will be BCH price surpassing BTC.

At the end of the day, bitcoin is math, not social science, and propaganda can only get you so far. The hard facts are hard fucking facts, and the facts say that BCH is far supeior *right fucking now* to BTC, and that this will always be the case because Core is dedicated to a development path completely contrary to BCH and has every intention of stubbornly never changing direction.

"#WRONG!

"160,000 transactions and climbing, 1 block every 25-40 minutes. That's a full day to process all the unconfirmed transactions if new ones stop pouring in. Sadly, that's not happening. There was a 3000 transaction increase over the last 2 blocks meaning that 3000 more transactions came in that went out. Currently if you have paid less than $100 fees on your transaction, forget it!

"> Who exactly do you think I'm shilling for? Get real.

Core. Pretend to be an ally and subtly undermine. This has been in their playbook for quite a while.

> You give Core's followers way too much credit. I'll make a prediction right now. They will change the proof of work, and it will only ""destroy their credibility"" in the minds of Bitcoin Cash supporters. As long as their price stabilises, they will not lose any support over changing the proof of work. In fact — they will gain some due to overselling the benefits of the new algorithm.

I do not think their mindless army of reddit followers have much power so I would say I would not give them much credit at all.
 
All this price pumping, I suspect, are from clueless investors who want to jump on the bitcoin bandwagon because they think it will go up forever. Those guys will be stuck without a chair pretty soon and start dumping it. 

As far as the mindless core army: I do not care what a couple hundred half a bitcoin investors in r/bitcoin think or do as they have almost no power here.
