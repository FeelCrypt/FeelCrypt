"Look, it's this simple, as a user, how could I trust putting my Ether in any wallet when it seems the code or whatever other logic is going on behind the scenes is too complicated for even the developers and they're making fundamental mistakes and they're getting hundreds of millions of dollars in other people's money lost or frozen permanently? Ethereum seems to let people shoot themselves in the foot quite easily.

I don't have any use for smart contracts. I just want to buy stuff. Other coins can do that too. Smart contracts will come to BTC and BCH. No advantage to Ethereum here only first mover advantage in the smart contract space.

The coin is inflationary, it's not a good store of value long term as an investment or savings. I guarantee my 1 BCH will be worth orders of magnitude more than my one XMR or ETH in 10 years time purely due to the fact that there's not an infinite supply of them. A hard limit of 21 million BTC or BCH is psychologically much harder to remove and wouldn't gain acceptance. Whereas Monero or Ethereum could tweak their distribution schedule in future which would be less of a big deal e.g. change the tail emission from 0.6 XMR to 1 XMR per block.

Centralised development. We only need to look at Bitcoin's centralised development by BlockStream to know it's a terrible idea. At least BCH has multiple teams working on things.

"**Tax incidence**

In economics, tax incidence or tax burden is the analysis of the effect of a particular tax on the distribution of economic welfare. The introduction of a tax drives a wedge between the price consumers pay and the price producers receive for a product, which typically imposes an economic burden on both producers and consumers. The concept was brought to attention by the French Physiocrats, in particular François Quesnay, who argued that the incidence of all taxation falls ultimately on landowners and is at the expense of land rent. Tax incidence is said to ""fall"" upon the group that ultimately bears the burden of, or ultimately has to pay, the tax.

"Consider the following:

Money as a tool for storing and transferring value can be compared to a bucket for storing and transferring water. Fiat, supposedly a good ""medium of exchange,"" is like a bucket that's easy to pour without spilling but that has a hole in the bottom, allowing water to leak out over time (inflation). Gold, supposedly a good ""store of value,"" is like a bucket that doesn't leak, but that's heavy and hard to pour without spilling (high transaction costs). But ""store of value"" and ""medium of exchange"" aren't really separate functions. The point of storing value is to eventually access it via a subsequent *exchange*. A bucket that didn't leak, but that spilled 95% of its water every time you tried to pour it would be essentially useless. And a medium of exchange wouldn't work if it couldn't do at least a reasonable job of storing its value between exchanges. It'd be like a bucket with no bottom (or a currency in hyperinflation). But the ideal monetary ""bucket,"" the one we should expect to ultimately outcompete all the others, is one that doesn't leak *or* spill. That's the potential that cryptocurrency offers.

"Please don't downvote, but I really like LTC for small transactions between exchanges.  It's fast, it's 2.5 minutes block time, compared to BTC/BCC block time of 10 minutes.  Fees are low too.

Please don't laugh, but I think DOGE is 1 minute. So fast, much wow.

I always wondered if there could be some ""hybrid"" system for a coin.

* Every 1 minute do 1MB blocks 
* every 2.5 Minutes do 2MB blocks 
* every 10 minutes do ""big block"" up to say 8 MB
* every 2 hours do ""mega blocks"" up to 64 MB 
* every 24 hours do a ""super mega block"", up to 512MB

"That's how it should work. Miners take high-fee transactions immediately, will fill their blocks (to whatever size fits for them) with low- and no-fee transactions, because being able to transfer funds cheaply makes bitcoin more useful and therefore more valuable.

If miners consider mining double-spends to be an attack on bitcoin - which it is - and always respond by mining the original version in an orphaning block, then zero-confs become secure enough for daily use, once a few major pools reflect the transaction back to you. This should take about the same time as PayPass and PayWave.

One thing that would be useful is an unforgable double spend notification - something that can't be created without having access to both transactions, but doesn't allow a miner who receives it to decipher and mine the conflicting transaction.

"Whichever party pays the fee, a high fee makes the transaction less likely to happen, which hurts business and hurts the consumer. It is lose-lose no matter how you slice it. 

Let's break it down it by cases:

- **Merchant pays the tx fee and takes the loss:** Consumers are happy on the short term because the price  doesn't increase for them, merchant is sad. In the long term the customer is also sad because there will eventually be fewer merchants to choose from as some go out of business due to the higher fees (or just stop accepting Bitcoin).

"If I'm correct, the whole thing with atomic swaps is they happen off-chain, thus no tx fees. See here: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=cBVcgzEuJ7Q

Also, using the LN and the side channels, theoretically the interchangeability between BTC & LTC may give us two chains to work with (while still maintaining their own respective sovereignty of course) in terms of scaling. This is just my observation based on the facts and concept of the atomic swaps on LN. 

Would love to have someone who works directly with LN or is more familiar with all this provide input.

"Haha, well, ""there is silver because there is silver"" is a wrong interpretation of what I said - and you know this ;) Try this one: Just because we live on a planet that happens to have different type of metals, and a rare one is gold, and a less rare one is silver, doesn´t mean it makes sense to make a copy paste version of the bitcoin source code with 84m ""coins"" instead of 21, these numbers have no real meaning in the first place, because it is digital and can be divided at will). 

This is totally different from the physical world, where at some point in history they had gold coins that needed to have a certain size for practical use, and because this much gold represented too much value, coins from less rare metals like silver where really useful.

However, there is no bailment relationship between Bitcoin Core and Litecoin.

People who understand what's going on are already driving BCH. Miners, merchants, consumers.

Why would you think this specifically?

I don't understand what your point is here. Who is getting fucked over? The people who invest in Bitcoin without understanding the technology? Or the people who are blindly investing in BTC hoping to be millionaires one day because the value keeps going up because the value is going up? I don't really care about these people.

Litecoin fails at market adoption. BCH is already dominating LTC in terms of market cap, merchant adoption and user adoption. LTC does not do what BCH does better because LTC has similar problems BTC has, they are just on a small scale so they haven't realized them yet.

Core apologist here.  The reason I'm not too concerned about the fees is that I think eventually, coins will be much more interchangeable, and will serve different functions.  Bitcoin will be a settlement layer, valued for its high security and stability, and Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, and other alts will be used for payments, when speed and cost are the biggest factors.

"They refuse to even think out the implications. *The best guarantee that a money will continue storing value effectively is its possession of the commercial network effect.* BTC has the commercial network effect now but is pissing it away at record speed as commerce grinds to a halt periodically with $20 fees and companies not even being able to predict whether a transaction makes business sense before they make it.

Without the commercial network effect, all BTC has is the ledger network effect - which BCH has equally  as much (and LTC doesn't, as far fewer consumers already hold LTC compared with BCH), and its inertia in standards/code and Core's social affiliations like with BitFinex.

"A newer narrative I have spotted around /r/bitcoin, /r/litecoin , and /r/cryptocurrency is that BTC is the ""store of value"" and LTC is the ""spending money"", now made bolder by [atomic swaps between the two](https://bitcoinist.com/first-ever-cross-chain-atomic-swap-between-bitcoin-and-litecoin-has-now-taken-place/), and other SegWit coins [like Vertcoin](http://www.newsbtc.com/2017/09/21/atomic-swaps-litecoin-vertcoin-works/).

LTC and BTC share SegWit, 1mb limited chain, the same centralized Core developers, the same poor performance and the same exact problems. LTC is just BTC with Scrypt ASICs and block timings unproven at high tx volume, which I think could have issues with orphaned blocks and other propagation problems. Another soft fork soon will see through an [optional privacy feature called Confidential Transactions apparently created by Greg Maxwell and Adam Back](https://news.bitcoin.com/confidential-transactions-add-anonymity-bitcoin-litecoin/), who have proven themselves arrogant, [incompetent developers](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#4d) already with the disastrous engineering of Bitcoin, though this seems by design to offload on-chain transactions to centralized fee collectors.

There is a linkage being formed between BTC, LTC, and VTC. VTC in particular definitely has its own brigade of eager shills.

Cash must now fight all three. Viacoin could be another in the future as another SegWit coin.

"Unlicensed crypto use is already functionally illegal in many developed nations, it's just a matter of how the State decides to target and prosecute.

It doesn't get talked about often enough, but the underground is the real origin of the Bitcoin project, and I think it still represents the hidden power-source of Bitcoin and all crypto. Wallstreet got into this by essentially attempting to speculate on the black market. By turning Bitcoin into a settlement layer, BTC-Bitcoin is sacrificing its own balls to structure Bitcoin into an alt-social-security program for Gen X, Y, and the Millennials. Many of them see this as Bitcoin growing beyond its unsavory origins. I see them as sellouts.

In regard to political ideals, BTC has failed. As BCH-Bitcoin takes up the torch, anarchy will sustain the project because the underground STILL harbors a real need for it. As long as there are States of tyranny, anarchy will never die.

Having just watched it the community is better prepared.

Just as one small example, while the bad actors are clearly desperate to take down key personas (Satoshi, Roger, Jihan) this time a lot more people are getting their backs.

> Why not just use ETH instead?

I don't think Eth is designed to be money.  There is a different incentive structure (than Bitcoin's) for all parties involved.  Vitalik is not an economist first (Satoshi was) plus he is still too key a player.  You can make a nice money on top of Eth but it will still be subject to Eth.  (Which, all aspects considered might not be a terrible thing, probably better than debt-backed fiat, but we have more than one choice.)  I'm not trying to say anything bad about Ethereum it's outstanding and is enabling tremendous creativity in the space, it's just not exactly ideal for money.  Money, of all possible applications, really does need to be ideal.  Notice all the idealism around it.  :)

"> by preventing the block-size from increasing 

I'm pretty sure most early adopters agree on increasing blocksize and they perfectly know it was the original idea about scaling.

> but there will always be countries that support and embrace the technology

Eh, I disagree. The fact that the technology might work gives no incentive to governments to give up the control of it.

Bitcoin was invented as a payment medium that had to be accepted to oppose and disrupt financial regulation.

At the moment it's just a medium of transfer of fiat money (and an investment) which gives more problems to governments and central banks than benefits which is why after China, the state of Washington, the European Union is going to regulate crypto currencies.

> They’ll eventually be forced to accept it as it becomes a global payment network.

Again, it's a global payment network as long as who uses it can exchange it for fiat.

The moment this possibility is tackled (like in China) the appeal of it disappears because 99.99% of crypto users will never use cryptocurrencies as a medium of payment without the possibility of exchanging it.";1;0;False;ep1939;dq0gq8m;You want to go grab a coffee??;7dk9ah;https://i.redd.it/5dcnsdhqsiyz.jpg

">The way I see it, first there was BTC, but then the community was split,

There's only been a split for those people who've *chosen* to split.  People who've remained impartial investment-wise and continued to hold their pre-fork bitcoins now have coins on *all* 3 forks.  Of course, those who've bought bitcoin core since the fork won't have automatically acquired coins on the other forks.  But you know, people shouldn't invest in things they don't understand, and if they're put off by dissent in the community, then we don't need their dumb money anyway, because it's the kind of money that rushes in and then rushes out all too easily.

>Bitcoin Gold followed by Bitcoin cash,

Bitcoin Cash came well before Bitcoin Gold.  And Bitcoin Gold, despite some cool features like using Vertcoin-style ASIC-resistant mining, it looks pretty much like an *actual* scamcoin, considering how the devs have allowed themselves to mine 100k coins privately before allowing for public mining.  Not to mention than there seems to be code that delivers the devs hidden fees.  But there's none of that kind of bullshit in BCH.

"> But saying that tether is baked by other cryptos is more than an enormous risk.

Where'd I say that?

 Other exchanges are backed by USDT and yes that is an enormous counter party risk on their behalf.

Other crypto currencies isn't backing USDT. All I'm saying about Bitfinex's cold storage is. How is it hard to believe that Bitfinex holds at least $600 million USD to back USDT when they hold billions worth of other assets?

And Kraken doesn't redeem USDT for USD at all, they trade it, it's free floating. The only reason USDT remains on par with USD is because people are able to pull off arbitrage.

In regards to USD and exchanges like Polo and Bittrex that depend on it yes you're absolutely right. Bitfinex goes insolvent then so do these exchanges which is why you need to be cautious of that counter party risk.

"That's not entirely true. They got cut off from sending USD internationally. They've since solved the problem by accommodating withdrawals through other fiat currencies internationally. In fact even immediately after they had lost ability to send USD abroad they remained sending USD domestically within Taiwan (where their banks were).

This is fairly viable in the market. If Bitfinex didn't maintain the ability to redeem USDT for USD then the value of USDT would free fall. Yet it's being traded free floating on Kraken and it trades on par. Furthermore Bitfinex BTC/USD price remains inline with that of Bitstamp, Kraken, Gemini, etc. This shows that arbitrage between these exchanges and Bitfinex exists not just for USDT/USD but also BTC/USD.";1;1;False;PoliticalDissidents;dpziqqe;More on Bitfinex's Tethers being fraud.

"You pretty much just contradicted yourself.

>If they just created dodgy balances people would have no way to withdraw it and any scam would be super-limited as withdrawals would quickly start failing (as in MtGox).

So you're saying Bitfinex would collapse if they did this and couldn't process withdrawals?

>On top of this Bitfinex has no banking access so without tethers users can't make withdrawals anyway.

So why have't they collapsed? Withdrawing USDT doesn't do anything in and of it's self.  It's just a token it only has value and hasn't collapsed. If Bitfinex didn't redeem USDT for the value of USD then USDT prices would plummet. People would sell it but no one would be buying it for value of USD. The thing is it remains on par with USD because Bitfienx does redeem it.

Bitfinex does have banking solutions. They got cut off transferring USD internationally but they still have banking relations and fulfill international fiat currency withdrawals through currencies other than USD. It doesn't matter if they redeem it directly for USD or value equivalent in an other fiat currency as people who then withdraw with.";1;0;False;PoliticalDissidents;dpzj6oz;More on Bitfinex's Tethers being fraud.

"Hello,

At Kraken we currently offer the USDTUSD pair.  All of our current pairs are shown at: https://www.kraken.com/help/fees

(This is in no way a position on the statements in the above thread, but rather a clarification that Kraken does currently offer USDTUSD as a currency pair available for trading.  Whether or not someone later cashes out in USD would depend on the client, the country they are in, whether they are set up to receive USD, etc.  With questions about USD support please contact support at support.kraken.com - Kraken does not offer phone support.)

Thanks to those who are using Kraken!

Like I said, it's visible in the market. For example when Bitfinex got their banking cut the prices on Bitfinex increased above market rate. This is because only way to get money out was to buy up crypto and withdraw. Then they made arbitrage possible  and Bitfinex prices fell back in line with the rest of the market. Just like how USDT prices dropped when Bitfinex got banking services cut.
