"Let me give some examples of the moderation style I will be using.

>No repetitive posts?

By this I mean for example that I will encourage people to not create multiple threads for the same article article. It is much more productive if the conversation happens in one thread rather spread across multiple threads. If the topic is huge though (e.g. ""USA accepts bitcoin as legal tender"" or something) then this would be fine.

>No being ""aggressive""?

People should not feel the need to assault or attack a person with personal insults. I will encourage users to be good to each other and respect that people have differing opinions.

>No faith in the community to downvote such things as they see fit?

I absolutely have faith that the community will upvote and downvote people as they see fit. This should be 99% of the moderation policy. I believe moderation (from the moderators) should only be a last resort.

>Sorry, I don't trust mods who don't trust their users.

"I dunno, I think it sort of does.
There are unmoderated subs, e.g. (not Bitcoin-related):

https://www.reddit.com/r/unmoderated/

It's up to the ""owner"" / creator of the subreddit to appoint further mods or get involved in moderation. However, obviously if things get out of hand (which they probably will) then Reddit admins might step in and do something about it. So I guess in that sense, there are no ""safe spaces"".

P.S. I agree with your sentiment that to be impartial, we should let algorithms sort it out. The problem there is: those who control the algorithm are effectively the moderators.

Me, along with tons of other bitcoin fans have been working together to bring people out of the censorious doucheland of /r/bitcoin and into to /r/btc, as an alternative place where people can discuss bitcoin the way reddit was intended: though the community.

All that good will, all that community support, down the drain. I don't get it. Why did you do it? You do realize many fans of bitcoin are also libertarians don't you? Did you think we would stand for this?

> In any case, like most everyone else, I'm done helping. I'm going to find a subreddit that shares my values of open discussion and letting reddit work the way it was designed to work.
