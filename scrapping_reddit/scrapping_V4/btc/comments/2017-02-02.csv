"> That's generous of you. I think Blockstream Core did more than just ""not call out the abhorrent censorship"". I think they orchestrated this WITH theymos, whilst pretending it was a coincidence.

"I actually held a survey on /r/btc and /r/bitcoin, asking ""Who do you think is most responsible for the schism in the Bitcoin community?"". Guess who came out on top in both surveys? 

Edit: Kinda depressing looking at [the survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc6Yhg6CYp5PV1kYKlko3u-ES-zoBW-zb0S8fK5oaKyTE8pJA/viewanalytics) now. The irony is also that it didn't get a lot of responses because I got banned over it. As I didn't know that Theymos real name was forbidden to post (it was in the survey).
