">  He supported 2x. Strongly. He went to bat for it. He was attacked mercilessly for it.

True.

> BCH forked off too early.

Disagree. It forked off early enough to avoid segwit. It was also insurance in case 2x failed to go through (which it eventually did).

> BTC has kept by far the largest amount of the hashpower

BTC has kept the largest amount of hashpower for a number of reasons.

> to the point where BCH will not be able to catch up in the next 6 months even if the cashening happens.

We'll see what happens. I am optimistic.

>  It is Bitcoin. Cash is the fork.

Agree, for now.

From my perspective he's kind of reneging on his original [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/46rkq7/bitcoin_roundtable_consensus/d07jtsz/). Sure he supported 2x, but the way I interpret his statement is to say that even if his proposed solution did not go through, he would **still support getting away from Core's leadership**, since they still don't support bigger blocks. Instead all he's said is ""at least we got segwit"", and that he has since bought back his BCH that he sold. Granted, it's his life and he can do what he wants. But to me he has not really lived up to his statement.";1;1;False;;dy39vr7;Erik Voorhees: “Roger - please stop referencing me to back up your opinion that Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin. It isn't.

">It was wrong for UASF to do it, and it's wrong to do it now.

Agreed. I'm fine with people leveraging that reasoning as a reductio ad absurdum of Luke's position though. 

>There's only so much we can do to help people who don't do their due diligence. Claiming to be the real bitcoin simply gives ammunition to the already very weak ""Ver is a fraud"" claims. Bitcoin censors don't need any more ammunition.

I really think what Core has turned Bitcoin into should not be called Bitcoin. Can you imagine if Core tried to ICO what they're trying to turn Bitcoin into? ""Bitcoin - A Congested-by-design High Fee Settlement Layer"" would have had a very hard time taking off in the current market. By hijacking an extent project and surreptitiously transforming it from Satoshi's low-fee P2P cash into another animal altogether they've managed to attract market interest that would be wholly unreachable otherwise. 

The name means **everything** to Core because their ideas fundamentally would not have legs without it.

All that said I get that it is what most people consider Bitcoin, by hook or by crook, and we should respect that I suppose. I don't really like what Roger's doing calling BCH Bitcoin and BTC Bitcoin Core, because I think it's stooping to Core's level.

"> What does this even mean? Core does not achieve consensus. Bitcoin has consensus, and Core develops software that fits **within** that consensus.  

Core is a single repository controlled primarily by a single person, but significantly influenced by a very small group. If the only consensus changes that ever arise on the SegWit BTC chain are from Core (and you haven't established that it's ever been or will be otherwise), than SegWit BTC is **massively** centralized. Since it is so centralized, saying ""Bitcoin Core"" to refer to the SegWit BTC chain is very accurate and leaves almost no room for misinterpreation, *while being the minimally offensive term*.  

> ""Significant"" is totally arbitrary. All of this shit is compatible. It's like if 99% of people use GMail, and you state that Gmail defines what email is, even though anyone can still use Hotmail or Yahoo Mail.  

Fine. Point me to a single conensus change in the history of SegWit BTC or that will be upcoming for SegWit BTC that doesn't emanate from massively centralized Core. No? Then nothing you've said changes anything.  

> It's backwards compatible. That's literally all that matters. Let's say Bitcoin Core doesn't even exist, and I secretly invent SegWit on my own. There's nothing stopping me from privately deploying it just for myself, without anyone's permission. It is full compatible with all the pre-existing rules of the system.

Sure, your logic here is totally sound.  But unfortunately we're talking about the definitions of words, and in that situation the views of the masses outweigh any logic we come up with in our own private corner.  Words are used to communicate, and the masses have decided a definition of the word that we don't like.  Changing the definition of this word will be exceedingly hard, and will probably conflict with the larger and more important goal - working on BCH's success as an ecosystem.

Where the bashing *does* come in is against the massive storm of unethical behavior emanating from Bitcoin (BTC)'s small block contingent. They've even got a council or politburo if you will (the Dragon's Den) coordinating their nefarious actions and smear campaigns. I have no problem with retaliation on that front that is as aggressive as can be managed. That aspect of the community is a cancer that must be dealt with. If not excised, it's influence must be minimalized or marginalized as much as possible.

1. Segwit transactions aren't so bad.  Hacky, yes, and definitely not ideal.  But they are safe to use and they do have signature data hashed into the merkle root despite the claims that they don't.

"There are quite a few mistakes and subtle misunderstandings in your comment, believe it or not.

>A soft-fork, by definition, is a fork where certain previously valid transactions are no longer valid.

No, not necessarily. It's a fork where previously valid *consensus rules of any sort* are no longer valid, i.e. when the consensus rules are tightened. There are plenty of per-transaction consensus rules, but there are more consensus rules than just those.

>A soft-fork makes it so that an old client can't send new transactions, but can receive new blocks.

This is totally false. Old clients can continue creating and broadcasting new transactions just fine, even after a successful soft fork activation, provided those transactions are not of a newly-invalidated format or type. In other words, old clients retain the ability to continue transacting after a soft fork occurs, which is the opposite of what you are claiming here.

>Nodes on the new version will drop transactions made by clients on the old version.

This is similarly false. Plenty of pre-0.13.1 nodes still exist (and continue to transact perfectly fine) on the Bitcoin network.

Transactions that fail the isStandard check are dropped (by policy, not strict consensus) by most nodes, but this is independent of forks, be they hard or soft.

>A hard-fork, by definition, is a fork where certain previously invalid transactions become valid.

Again, false. That is not the definition of a hard fork (the actual definition is significantly more general than that). A hard fork requires a broadening/expansion of the consensus ruleset, but this ruleset includes more than just per-transaction validity.

>A hard-fork makes it so that an old client can send transactions, but can't receive new blocks.

Not necessarily, again.

>Nodes on the old version will drop transactions made by clients on the new version.

They will ban and ignore peers that are in violation of their consensus rulesets altogether.

>Quite literally, the only difference between a soft-fork and a hard-fork is whether it's invalid transactions being made valid (hard-fork), or old transactions being made invalid (soft-fork).

Again, imprecise and consequently false.

>If you do both (so that you actually split into two chains), it's generally also called a hard-fork, but it technically isn't, it's both a soft-fork and a hard-fork.

Again, you are confused on definitions here, which is resulting in incorrect (and verging on nonsensical) assertions. There *is* actual meaningful and precise terminology which is used to classify or compare/contrast different types of soft and hard forks, but your explanation here is incorrect as a direct result of your misunderstanding on the respective definitions of ""soft forks"" and ""hard forks""; once you understand that a hard fork is the loosening of consensus rules (such that previously-observed rules are no longer enforced) and a soft fork is a tightening of consensus rules, it becomes clear that any hard fork implementation which also includes the addition of new rules or constraints (which would represent a soft fork if decoupled from the new rule relaxations and implemented in a backwards-compatible way) is just a hard fork, and there's nothing ""soft"" about it. To classify it further (or more precisely) I'd need to hear the specific details of the change(s) in question, but I'm happy to help you with this if you have any examples in mind that are leaving you scratching your head.

>All of those were contentious soft-forks that were upheld through a sybil attack that stopped miners from having their blocks propagated.

Another definitional inaccuracy to finish things off. The rejection of consensus-violating appends to the ledger is not a Sybil attack, just like a 51% attack would not be a Sybil attack. Sybil attacks [*can* be performed to effect certain results in Bitcoin](https.bitcoin.it/wiki/Weaknesses#Sybil_attack), but trying to argue that ""enforcing new soft forks is a type of Sybil attack"" is an abuse of terminology.

">Then Bitcoin Core has had numerous hardforks, as a node from 2010 will not sync to today's chain without significant changes.

Again, you are mistaken.

""Bitcoin Core"" has never incorporated a hard forking change, though you could argue that ""Bitcoin QT"" did, with the updates in 2013 corresponding to the BerkeleyDB to LevelDB switch, because of the (user-configurable) lock restrictions in BerkeleyDB. Of course, if you customized your BerkeleyDB settings specifically to accommodate high simultaneous lock counts, you'd be able to sync with the chain just fine even with Bitcoin software from 2010. See [here](https://blog.bitmex.com/bitcoins-consensus-forks/) for a more comprehensive history of consensus updates to Bitcoin.

The UASF for BIP-148 was indisputably enacted, and successfully so.

"Hash power costs electricity that needs to be paid for.  Paying fees to yourself to move your own transactions is not paying for the electricity bill.  Mining is a low margin business - you are putting back most of your earnings for the electricity.  So I do not think your scenario plays out.

Also whether you have 1MB blocks or 1GB blocks, *eventually* be it a million years, the blockchain will fill every atom on the planet - so we will need clever methods to prune the blocksize at some point and throw away the transaction for coffee from 50,000 years before.

> No soft forks in Bitcoin have used, relied upon, or even somewhat incorporated Sybil attacks in their deployment or activation.

Suuuuuuure. Clearly the UASF didn't rely on a sybil attack, clearly not. Launching thousands of nodes that would drop non-SegWit blocks once UASF was triggered definitely wasn't a sybil attack. Multiple Class-C IP blocks being full of nodes, controlled by the same person or people, that all ran UASF nodes, those were clearly innocent and not at all the preparation for a sybil attack. Node count increasing with more and more UASF nodes? Clearly wasn't a preparation for a sybil attack.

Just because it was never taken into action, and was only a threat that made miners support SegWit for fear of the consequences in case Core went ahead with their attack, doesn't mean it wasn't used.

">Your definition of ""remarkably mistaken"" is to speak solely about transactions, rather than saying ""transactions/blocks/protocols"", when talking about transactions and their relations to forks, in the context of transactions. Nice.

My definition of ""remarkably mistaken"" is standard; when something is phrased strongly, specifically, and falsely, it is mistaken. Your definitions of various types of forks are *not* the actual established definitions, and lead directly to erroneous conclusions, because you're confused on terminology and spreading your confusion as much as you can.

>A simultaneous tightening and broadening of the rules by, for example, enabling new previously-invalid transaction types and disabling previously-valid transaction types, has properties of both a soft fork and a hard fork. It is simultaneously a soft fork and a hard fork, as it's the same as having a hard fork immediately followed by a soft fork.

No, it is simply a hard fork. This is why definitions matter, and your incorrect conclusion here is a result of you not knowing the actual definitions of these terms.

If a new consensus protocol is backwards-compatible with the old one, it is a soft fork. If it is not, it is a hard fork. When you get the definitions wrong, you wind up making stupid mistakes like this one, where you think ""It's *both* a hard fork and a soft fork!"" despite this being a definitional impossibility due to the mutual exclusivity of the two terms.

>There is nothing in the definitions directly stating that if both occur it is to be called solely a hard fork

Yes, there is. If the consensus change is backwards incompatible, it is a hard fork, *no matter the details of the change*. You're simply mistaken. 

>if you buy a new house and sell your old one you'll generally say you've bought a house, rather than saying you've sold a house, despite both occurring.

You can buy a house without selling another, and you can sell a house without buying another. If you've bought a new house, you can definitely say that you have done so, just like you can also say ""I sold my old house and bought a new one."" These are all valid statements. However, they are not relevant to your terminological misunderstanding regarding blockchain consensus forks.

>Nice strawman you got there. What I said is that the UASF, which would have nodes attacking the network to stop the propagation of non-SegWit blocks, was being widely supported by the Bitcoin Core community when they didn't have sufficient miner support for SegWit.

No, you didn't. Go re-read your above comment and look at what you *actually* said regarding ""Sybil attacks""... it isn't what you seem to be pretending it was.

A simultaneous tightening and broadening of the rules by, for example, enabling new previously-invalid transaction types and disabling previously-valid transaction types, has properties of both a soft fork and a hard fork. It is simultaneously a soft fork and a hard fork, as it's the same as having a hard fork immediately followed by a soft fork.

There is nothing in the definitions directly stating that if both occur it is to be called solely a hard fork, it's just common to do that, as a hard fork generally speaking has more implications than a soft fork, the same way if you buy a new house and sell your old one you'll generally say you've bought a house, rather than saying you've sold a house, despite both occurring.

> ""enforcing new soft forks is a type of Sybil attack"" is an abuse of terminology

Nice strawman you got there. What I said is that the UASF, which would have nodes attacking the network to stop the propagation of non-SegWit blocks, was being widely supported by the Bitcoin Core community when they didn't have sufficient miner support for SegWit. People were widely suggesting setting up more and more nodes to have a high enough number to successfully launch a sybil attack, forcing the nodes to change to SegWit to not have their income nullified.

Or is it that attempting to launch a high enough number of nodes to subvert the network by not relaying blocks (or transactions) other than the ones they create not a sybil attack?

Likewise, those other proposals I mentioned also had high numbers of nodes being spun up in order to force miners to change their own mining rules, or they'd be facing a sybil attack: they weren't enforced through mining consensus but rather through nodes being spun up to control block propagation and drop blocks that didn't follow the proposal, or under the threat of doing so. They only began gaining miner support once the threat of a sybil attack became more prominent.

And yes, I'd argue that enforcing new soft forks through a high number of nodes controlled by only a few actors (like the few Class C IP blocks that had 200+ nodes, one per IP), despite lack of miner and user consensus, designed to force them to abide by your soft fork or to face losses from the attack, is a sybil attack.";1;1;False;Okymyo;dy3wusu;Bitcoin Cash is upgrading on May 15 to 32MB max block limit;8el8n7;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8el8n7/bitcoin_cash_is_upgrading_on_may_15_to_32mb_max/

[Dollar.org](https://Dollar.org) is for American dollars \(USD\). It looks like an open source github project page. Well made, no ads or news. You cannot obtain USD from this site, but they direct you to places in which you can and show you how to store it.

Dollar is mentioned 10 times on the first page.

[Dollar.com](https://Dollar.com) is for American cash \(USC\). The currency of Canada. It looks like a professional business website, with news, articles, guides, graphs and also misinformation about USD. There are only graphs for USD, none at all for USC, despite that being the main currency of the site.

It also mentions the word dollar 60 times on the main page, Only mentioning American cash 5 times.

You can buy USD, or USC from here directly. The price of each coin is only displayed in small font in the top right. It does not show next to the purchase window. Even if you know the difference, the purchase window is identical apart from switching the words cash and dollars, and the price point/coins you receive. Neither logo is displayed.

"Two? So you consider Dollar Gold, and Dollar Private are not dollars?

By your logic, Dollars used to be Dollars, now dollar.com calls them Dollar Core (everyone else calls them Dollars still), and tells you Dollar Cash is Dollar, and Dollar is now Dollar Core, there's also this thing called Dollar Private, and Dollar Gold, but they don't discuss those much, as they aren't really dollars. The rest of the world still uses Dollar for Dollars, and Dollar Cash for Dollar Cash.

Some people like to call Dollar Cash the Dollar (DCH), and call Dollar the Dollar (DLR).

"The very first line of what you linked:

When you buy something in Canada you pay in Canadian dollars, when you buy something in the United States, you pay in United States dollars. Prices aren't ""100 dollars"" they are ""100 CA dollars"" or ""100 US dollars,"" simply saying ""dollars"" is slang that's understood in the currencies domestic country.
        
Being ambiguous and labeling a price as ""100 dollars"" lets the value vary between a large difference considering  1 CAD, 1 USD, 1 AUD, 1 Hong Kong dollar etc are all valued differently.
       
There's also the difference between exchanges in the currencies. For example 100 Hong Kong dollars might buy $16.31CAD or $12.74USD....HOWEVER, that $12.74USD could be converted into $16.36CAD which is 5 cents more only from a small transaction.";14;2;False;FamousM1;dy4kayo;Let's start a class action lawsuit against Canada for calling their currency the dollar.

"Yeah pretty obviously so. For all talk of delusional shills, how can they not see that those 2 are deliberately similar and misleading. It shows only the chart history of BTC. I could not find the BCH chart anywhere. If it is on there it is not obvious. The only place it shows the price is in the top right, where it lists BTC first, obviously not next to the currency that you are buying, like every single other exchange that I have seen.

The symbols are essentially the same \(flipped, different shade of orange, and a box\). No price listed. Clicking help leads to complete lies and misinformation about the two different coins. It reads like a toilet paper commercial saying that it absorbs 10x more than the next leading brand. It says that bitcoin core is not a digital currency.

Even if it's complete trash which it is not, it still is a digital currency, and happens to be the most used one at 37&#37;. BCH is at 5&#37;. It's the 4th most used coin and people literally got it for free essentially from the fork. No money created, but split into 2 currencies.

 bit·coin 

A type of digital currency in which encryption techniques are used  to regulate the generation of units of currency and verify the transfer  of funds, operating independently of a central bank. 

The getting started with bitcoin has a buy Bitcoin button. No mention of cash vs core. Going to purchase shows you either how much core or cash you will receive. It does not display the price, or chart history of either.

Please explain to me how that is not confusing. Differences: Core vs Cash.

0.01550474 BTC vs 0.10408716 BCH

One decimal difference. One letter difference. Its hard to tell which one is more even looking closely. Decimals are hard to decipher for most people. If you do not know that there is a difference between cash and core, which you certainly would not know from [bitcoin.com](https://bitcoin.com), you would not even not even bother checking for the difference. Even a knowledgeable person could easily purchase the wrong coin by mistake because they are nearly identical buy pages. 

If you are a layman that wants to invest in bitcoin and go to [bitcoin.com](https://bitcoin.com). All the front page tells you is ""The Bitcoin Core \(BTC\) network is in trouble due to high fees and slow  transaction times. Bitcoin Cash \(BCH\) is the upgrade that solves these  problems."" That would obviously suggest that BTC is the old dated model, and that BCH is better. A currency website should not try to argue which currency is better. [bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org) certainly does not, nor mention any other coin for that matter. Why would they?

[Bitcoin.org](https://Bitcoin.org) also does not provide a purchasing service. That is good, they are a currency. Currencies should be attained through exchanges, not home plate. That is not ethical. Instead they link you to the exchanges in which you can purchase them from. At [Bitcoin.com](https://Bitcoin.com) they obviously they sell their own product because they are not a legitimate product.

"Still beats ending up in Slovenia and getting deceived by their knockoff of a dollar. Imagine that, I went to a high-class restaurant there as a sharp dressed man, with my silk suit, black tie, and fat wallet. After having an exquisite night dining, I went to pay my bill and asked the waiter, ""Do you accept dollars?"" He said, ""Yes, yes, we accept tolar."" So I gave him $500 to pay for a $300 meal (copious amounts of liquor included), and I told him, ""I don't want to order anything else, so give me back 200 dollars, please."" The waiter was quite surprised by my request (he probably thought I was giving him an extra generous tip), so he gave me 200 tolars back. It was only until I went to the exchange office to exchange them for U.S. paper money that I realized I was deceived! As a result, I decided to sue the restaurant for not warning me about my grave mistake and the Slovenian government for issuing a currency whose name was intended to deceive foreigners. And sure enough, I won the case! The government was forced to replace the tolar with the euro, and I received my 200 dollars back (before deducting attorney fees).

"This isn't comparable IMO,

Types of Dollars are largely geographically isolated in their use, you are gonna have a hard time finding a US website that takes anything but US Dollars, and if you go down the street and you won't find any store that posts prices simply in Dollars, but then you find out what they mean is CAD! 

You also wouldn't want to have a website say they accept ""Dollars"" and if you send them US Dollars ""WHOOPS! WE ONLY ACCEPT CANADIAN DOLLARS SORRY YOUR MONEY IS LOST TO THE ETHER!""

In the real world this doesn't happen because of context, if you're in Canada, you expect they are using CAD, Canadian websites the same thing there's usually a flag or the URL gives it away.

That's that major problem with websites calling Bitcoin Cash simply Bitcoin, what context is there for users to know which coin it is?

"It's a racket. Those fucking Kiwis think they can just copy The US Dollar and call it ""dollar."" Seriously? Everyone knows kdollars are krapdollars. Then you get the Canadians and Aussies piling on the bandwagon, trying to ride the USAs coattails.

The other day I was in Dollar General and I tried to pay in dollars. Well it turned out I had fucking Canadian dollars. Canadian! How was I to know, they were rectangular pieces of paper with pictures and numbers on them, they looked like money to me.

"How many people in reality lose their coins because they thought they were buying BTC when in reality they bought ""cheap BCH"" (how can you even mix up if it's so much cheaper)?  Exchanges surely have adopted the new ""bitcoincash:"" format, which is probably why they don't use that as an excuse much but say merchants receive BCH instead of BTC from users because of confusion and they don't redeem their coins.

The symbol is still BCH. It's like asking when in Canada ""do you want to buy dollars (CAD) or American dollars (USD)?"" But anyway if someone is ignorant enough to spend a more than trivial amount of money on a currency without knowing what he's buying I'm tempted to say he deserves to ""lose"" the money...
