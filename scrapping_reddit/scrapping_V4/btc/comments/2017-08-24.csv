"Time and time again I posted, ""Even after SW activates, users will have to create new SW compliant wallets, move their coins into them, (spending a ""normal"" fee first), and then finally use them again to gain the benefit"".

Time and time again I was berated for not knowing what I was talking about.

I mentioned nearly eight months ago that SW addresses will require a new type of address and possibly a new format.

I was downvoted to oblivion, called a ""r\/btc shill"" and ""clueless"".

I posted that Lightning channels will require two fees to operate plus a middle man fee for each transaction across the channel. I was wildly berated as an idiot.

Go ahead, Core. Prove me right again, because *I already know that's exactly how it is going to work.* Miner fees are going to be siphoned into hub fees, Lightning channels will be prohibitively expensive to open even with SW-secured coins ready to deploy, and not only will on-chain fees rise *even further*, those new middle man fees will become nearly unavoidable - and the alternative of using a ""legacy"" transaction will be *even more expensive than that*!

Bitcoin doesn't have a future for consumers, at least while this scaling plan is being followed. That price can continue to rise, but so long as the fees (denominated in **satoshi per byte**) also rise, the utility of Bitcoin is continuously being reduced. Anyone accepting Bitcoin has to be aware that fees are a significant overhead that limit the utility of a payment method. It is pointless to accept Bitcoin in a candy store, for example: the average purchase is smaller than the average network fee.

The common Bitcoin user has one option: pay an exorbitant fee to move your coins. SegWit introduces a second option: pay an exorbitant fee to move your coins into an address that gets a discount in the future.

"Yes. Models of this network estimate that the average transaction would require six hops across it to resolve, meaning seven signatories to the transaction are required (sender, five middle men, recipient). Each additional signatory to a channel introduces an additional point-of-failure that could lock the channel for timeout by not participating, and increases the overall closing costs for the channel by increasing the size of the underlying Bitcoin transaction.

Of course, such a network doesn't exist in a vacuum and it is 100% likely at least one enterprising individual will charge a middleman fee for the convenience of using his globally reliable and highly-connected liquidity to transfer funds with less hops (and thus, lower network fees for the user, netting an overall savings).";7;1;False;chernobyl169;dm2ivrm;"I love how all the trolls battled us when we said ""SW provides no immediate relief"".

"Not exactly how I understand it. For typical transactions you have to put a $8 to on-ramp and a &8 off-ramp so a minimum $16 LN fee assuming Hubs don't charge anything.  

the bitcoin is not yours while its not on a private key you control, it's in a LN Hub smart contract, that requires monitoring on your part. 

a strait up block size increase refuses the discounted fee from $8 per transaction to about $0,02 per transaction. 

on the idea of reducing the UTXO Segwit is making it bigger as bitcoin with a value less than $8 will soon become unspendable, while with a block size increase you can consolidate dust with up to a $0.02 value.

I remember this too, and can't exactly place the details. I'm pretty sure the issue was with network liquidity - more hops per channel also means more channels per node, and channels require available funding.

Well, you're very correct that to establish a lightning channel is somewhat expensive and that indeed it only works for recurring payments, which is untypical for common uses. I'd just like to say that even though most people will not benefit from SegWit (contrary to popular belief), everyone will benefit from the reduced amount of transactions in the mempool due to the rare few users that do multiple recurrent payments. I count here things like inter-exchange transfers and potentially mining pools. This should help reducing the network fees as a result, but I doubt the effect will be much beyond a 5-10% fee (edit: reduction).;1;2;False;manly_;dm2x9r4;"I love how all the trolls battled us when we said ""SW provides no immediate relief"".

The difference between Bitcoin fees and fiat fees is that with fiat you have a *choice*. Fiat's purest form is physical cash which you can hand to another person with no fees. With bitcoin, you have no choice other than to use the blockchain, so if you're not holding large UTXOs, then your money is literally disappearing to fees.

"I'm sure there were *some* low-functioning Core trolls who believed SegWit would provide an insta-boost, and I'm sure there were *some* technically accurate but largely misleading comments from certain people who knew better (like Greg). 

But I'd like to believe most people were aware that the discount would only come into play after funds had been moved to SegWit compatible addresses. So even if every bitcoiner started exclusively making SegWit transactions from the moment it activated you still wouldn't see any increase in capacity for a few days at least.
