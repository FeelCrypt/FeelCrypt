"Their masternode idea doesn't even work in theory. Only one masternode needs to log the traffic and there's no privacy anymore. There's at least 5 US TLAs that I can think of that would have the money and incentive to run master nodes and log traffic: NSA, DEA, FBI, ATF, CIA etc. That's not counting all the other TLAs around the world.

It was a blatant instamine then they never bothered to restart the coin. Now there is nothing to say they're not an elaborate ponzi. The earlies can get out while the going is good. They can let the price gradually pump up to $1000+ from dumb investors so the earlies can get out and dump their coins meanwhile the coin's value will slowly diminish afterwards. If there was no instamine I would rate Dash in the top 10 for sure. But with the instamine it's about a low 500 coin like most of the scam ICOs just out to make a quick buck.

It's hard to tell just from  memory was years back. But from what I recall they started restricting arbitrage before fully cutting it off. They instated KYC to discourage withdrawals and before they cut off banking fully I believe they permitted domestic JPY withdrawals.

"I feel sad that core has taken so long to bring out scaling solutions like LN, saying that, I think it would have moved faster if the miners didn't block segwit for so long.

On the other hand, I feel happy that there is a free market of competing ideas and that Bitcoin cash can compete in that free market. 

I have introduced thousands of people to bitcoin at talks I give at conferances. I used to ask people  if you haven't used bitcoin before please come and see me after my talk and I will show you how to set up a wallet and I'll send you a dollar to try it out. This usually gives people the Aha moment!

 Well I can't do that anymore because the fees are 3 to 5 or even 9 dollars, so I now have to ask them to install coinomi and give me a bitcoin cash address. I am only one guy but many others will do the same with eth, bitcoin cash or litecoin. This will lead many to question why and confidence will sadly drain away from the bitcoin brand. 

I actually wish that core would have supported slightly bigger blocks and then gone for segwit and LN after that because I don't buy that bitcoin can be digital gold, why? Because cryptos that are useful and secure enough can also be digital gold. 

At the end of the day I believe blockchains have an inherent bottle neck and that projects like iota could have the potencial to fix it because there is not 1 single 10 minute heartbeat but many blocks all linking to each other. There are problems with that project too (coordinator) so let's see if that gets fixed. 

Anyway, I try not to get dogmatic and stay scientific. 

In math we trust. In fiat we throw up on.

"Who said it was an insult? It's just plain wrong, I don't go round calling it ""bcash"" because I know it triggers you lot, if you want to call it bitcoin cash, go ahead.

"> With 100k sign ups a day, can you imagine the customer support workload? Have you tried sending a support ticket to Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter before?

There are two problems with this comment. In reverse order:

Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter are free for users, paid for by advertisers. And you can be sure they provide excellent customer service for their bigger paid customers.

Now on to the 100K number (which seems made up, but let's assume it's true).

With 100K sign-ups a day, presumably they have a LOT of new revenue. With all that revenue, they should be able to provide proportionate customer service staff. It may take some time to train people, but it takes no time to train a person to send back a brief manual reply to every inquiry.

Furthermore, it's not anybody's fault but that of Coinbase that they answer customer service requests privately to each customer. As a result they duplicate effort. If they provided proper customer service in a public forum, they would have to answer each question only once. Only very specific account-related questions, not general to many people, need to be addressed privately.

Finally, most of their customer service requests are of three types:

1. My account was suddenly disabled or suspended without warning.
2. You are suddenly without prior warning requiring me to use Auth. I don't want to use Authy.
3. My withdrawal/deposit was initiated weeks ago and still hasn't shown up.

The correct solution to these problems is not to provide customer service, but rather, to automate this type of inquiry. Simply provide the user with a menu item to initiate inquiries on these topics, and have the website software either take action (e.g., turn off Authy), or give the user back an ACCURATE status. **Providing accurate status is not hard at all -- it's just a database look-up.** It's like looking up package tracking on Fedex or UPS -- it's all automatic, and **if your package gets lost, you at least know how far it got.**";6;0;False;ray-jones;dqds03v;PSA to Developers: Coinbase is hiring 5 developers to work full time on the open source cryptocurrency of their choice!;7foqr3;https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/934563254101164033?s=17

"Block size increases may not be a complete solution, but that's not the only way to do on-chain scaling.  Sharding, root pruning, 0-conf transactions, and graphene/block compression are some options that could also be explored.  And in any case, just because some solution won't get us to Visa-level transactions all by itself doesn't mean it should be categorically ruled out as a near-term solution.  The whole argument against big blocks is totally illogical--who cares if it's not the be-all end-all, it would help NOW, when the network is already congested, expensive, and unreliable.  Honestly I didn't even start to take sides in this debate until I started seeing $10-$20 fees and multi-day wait times to exchange BTC, that shit's brutal when you're a small-potatoes investor like me. I dumped my BTC before the last dip below $6000 when BCH spiked, and was going to buy back in until I saw the fees and the mempool.  After weeks of that nonsense, I did the research on SegWit and LN, the only scaling options BTC has left, and I don't like the security risks they introduce...so the only thing left with the Bitcoin name I care about right now is Bitcoin Cash.  But if Core/legacy Bitcoin ever gets LN up and running and manages to get wide deployment without major security snafus, and the fees and confirmation times go back to something reasonable, I'll be back.

Maybe if Bitcoin had decentralized governance like Dash and Decred, talking about user consensus would be meaningful, but the only way to vote in BTC is with hash power...i.e. only the miners get a meaningful voice.

"> As long as a Bitcoin client contacts a peer to peer network and updates a global ledger of where funds are allocated, it's still ""Bitcoin"".

So you don't see the combo of SegWit and LN payment channels as violating that?  With LN it's not necessary, technically, to close the channel as long as the earliest timelock is set sufficiently far in the future.  LN channels are essentially secured with the ""threat"" of settlement, there's no hashpower or PoW preventing you from double-spending as long as the channel remains open.  To me that seems like a fundamental protocol change, as different from the original bitcoin as http is from ftp.  

Just because BTC has a higher marketcap and more hashpower than BCH doesn't make it any less of a departure from the original Bitcoin design.  You know, the design where all transactions are on a distributed public ledger and secured by miners performing PoW?  Taking transactions off the ledger and changing how they are secured is a pretty fundamental change, don't you think?  

The fact that it could be done without a hard fork is somewhat immaterial, BTW--SegWit only works without a hard fork because pre-SegWit addresses treat SegWit transactions as having no signature data, basically like unaddressed checks.  The soft fork ""works"", but opens up a whole new security vulnerability.  A hard fork would have been safer, and the fact that lack of consensus is the reason Core opted for a soft fork should tell you something.

"> there's no hashpower or PoW preventing you from double-spending as long as the channel remains open

I don't think that's true; could you explain what you mean how a double-spend could happen with an open Lightning Channel? When a channel is opened, that transaction is added to the blockchain, so whatever inputs I put into the channel, I cannot double-spend elsewhere on the blockchain, since all the other nodes in the network would see those inputs as already spent to the blockchain (so all the standard hashpower/PoW would guard it). Inside the channel, funds can only be directed to one or the other of the parties in the channel. I could send funds to my channel partner, but where else could I ""double-spend"" them? If I try and re-allocate them back to myself, my trading partner would have to agree to update the state of the channel. So, there's no hashpower guarding guarding a state update of a channel, but it requires explicit agreement between the two parties.

> pre-SegWit addresses treat SegWit transactions as having no signature data, basically like unaddressed checks. The soft fork ""works"", but opens up a whole new security vulnerability.

If the majority of the network nodes (mining or non-mining; doesn't matter) agree to adhere to the Segregated Witness rules (that those funds aren't really ""unaddressed checks""), then there's no issue. If a naive client (based on old code) or an intentional attacker tries to sweep funds from a SegWit address, they would need to mine the transaction themselves (no easy feat in the first place), and if they did, that block would be immediately orphaned by the rest of the network. The attacker could continue to mine on their created block (creating a hard-fork of the blockchain at that point), but what would be the point? There would be no incentive for anyone else to join them on that fork other than those who were so opposed to Segregated Witness as a feature that they're willing to endorse the theft of other people's funds in order to show that opposition. While there does seem to be people that speak out that passionately against Segregated Witness, odds are that community would be quite small compared to the whole rest of the Bitcoin community, and that hard-forked chain would be ignored by the majority and would have no effect on the Segregated Witness funds.";1;1;False;MidnightLightning;dqex7r4;"""Bitcoin.com wallet now displays ""Bitcoin Cash"" and ""Bitcoin Core"" balances.

"BCH won't ever gain majority hashrate unless it surpasses the profitablity of BTC which would require BCH price to surpasses the BTC price. That is very unlikely. Bitcoin only readjusting 2016 blocks is irrelevant here as long as it maintains majority hashrate and that it has and now will retain as BCH hashrate will always be low now that EDAs was replaced with DAAs. The 2016 block readjustment window I only kills off the BTC chain is the absolute majority of miners ditch it. Good luck with that. 

The point reason why 2/3rd mined BCH a while back was because of EDAs being manipulated. Those are gone so now that will never happen again.

"He just blatantly lied, *again*, in the middle of this video. He said ""someone was caught red-handed paying money to support Bitcoin Core"", but that is *exactly the opposite* of what happened.

The recent vote-bot incident that he was referring to was actually upvoting and promoting comments *in favor of BCH and AGAINST Bitcoin Core*. This is the fact of the matter. The censorship_notifier ""exposé"" regarding this incident tried to fallaciously argue that this was a false-flag campaign in an attempt to make it seem like BCH proponents were behind the attack (and note that this was thoroughly debunked, and to date no meaningful rebuttals have surfaced to the debunking in question)... but the fact of the matter is that portraying it as ""someone was caught trying to promote Bitcoin Core"" is a *false* statement, no matter which version of the story you believe.

The more they see that this bothers us, they more they will continue to call it bcash and that's exactly what we're seeing.

Anyhow, keep up the amazing work and being an advocate for Bitcoin and financial freedom, you know I support you! ;66;1;False;BitcoinXio;dqfa3r4;An apology;7fy6af;https://youtu.be/o8uNkcvtRtA

Roger that's how some of these people operate. They hounded Mike Hearn until he left. They're almost as bad as scientologists in the mind games they play. They do it just to break you and make you lose it. ;205;12;False;cipher_gnome;dqf7mfe;An apology;7fy6af;https://youtu.be/o8uNkcvtRtA
"FWIW thank you for standing up to this prick's insults and lies, especially the implication that people calling it bitcoin cash being only you, Jihan and ""sock puppets"".

This community has raised more than $17,000 in just about two days for the bitcoin cash fund (now more than $80,000 in two weeks). By saying there is no grass-root support for bitcoin cash, that prick insulted the whole bitcoin cash community not just you.";142;2;False;solitudeisunderrated;dqf7ttr;An apology;7fy6af;https://youtu.be/o8uNkcvtRtA
"hahaha you guys are crazy. If Bitcoin is so broken, why wouldn't he just sell it? Why wouldnt he trade it for another CC? You are being duped. Why do you even want bitcoin in the name if it is so bad?

BCash is a shitty alt-coin used to benifit this guy and made him millions. ";-15;4;False;klmeijohu9i23n;dqf8h9l;An apology;7fy6af;https://youtu.be/o8uNkcvtRtA
"5 years was all it took, to turn Bitcoin from an free, open and global Internet-enabled money for everyone, into a settlement network for the rich. I understand your frustration.

They simply do not get it. A Bitcoin that is for everyone, has the potential to alter the course of human development for centuries into the future, for the betterment of all mankind, not just the already well-off in the 1st world. It has the potential over time to end the suffering of millions of people.

Yet here we are, r/bitcoin feeling smug about Roger V. giving the finger, then he feels he has to make an apology on YouTube and now we're discussing it on Reddit.

This is not what Bitcoin should be about. Sorry Roger.";91;2;False;atroxes;dqfalbr;An apology;7fy6af;https://youtu.be/o8uNkcvtRtA

"Just watched the video now... it's very infuriating just to watch. You don't have to apologise to anyone for going through that... I'd love to see some proper debates happen with a decent moderator... 

anyway despite all this... i do sort of have this 'fog lifting' sort of feeling surrounding BCH and BTC. If this is the best debate the small block 'team' can put up, then I weep for them. It won't matter in a few years. We're only human, and you can tell the interviewer just has no regard for the work Roger and anyone else has done to try and help Bitcoin along. You're too kind for your own good to agree to this, just because none of the serious players will have a live debate (as I've seen hinted at around here before)

The one part I really don't like is attacking his business and saying it's not successful because it doesn't make over 1mil. I'm a self employed musician and recording engineer, I would feel very safe saying I'm good at my job, but i'll be fucked if I ever make 1 mil in a year.

"Watching that turned me off even more to Bitcoin core supporters like the host (John?) in the Error Log video. 

As the saying goes, an idiot will drag you down to their level and beat you with experience. They couldn’t win otherwise if arguments were based on merit or logic.

The interview on The Rubin Report was great, if you're going to do interviews with YouTube personalities that's the type of interview you should do, and type of person you should be talking with..   Not antagonistic trolls.  ;155;9;False;;dqf78d3;An apology;7fy6af;https://youtu.be/o8uNkcvtRtA
