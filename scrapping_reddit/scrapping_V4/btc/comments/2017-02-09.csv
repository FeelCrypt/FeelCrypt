"I get your point, but I see it as a result of the circumstances we are in rather than a disingenuity. Bitcoin Unlimited is almost certainly not an ideal upgrade, but a solution weaved within the atmosphere of unexpected social manipulation. Those who (rightly) view it within that context and those who don't will have problems communicating.

But yeah, I can't deny that I get frustrated when the occasional persons who are both anti-censorship *and* anti-BU get singled out and decimated from all sides. Those are the debates we should be having, and those that don't get drowned are usually interesting.

"> ideology over pragmatism

You might also call it enlightened self-interest. There was a time when this was assumed normal, and part of being a decent person.

Regardless, expecting censorship supporters to cheer for censorship is quite naive. A good example is luke-jr, who signs texts condemning censorship while at the same time claiming it doesn't exist in the notorious forum.

Most modern autocrats talk extensively about how much they love freedom of speech, free-press and so on. This always happens in parallel to their education of public about public good (fear mongering if you prefer), however. For those who are unfortunate enough to be living in one of those places where censorship is prevalent, drawing parallels is almost inevitable.

The only thing I can call ""evidence"" is the fact that Adam only produced supporting rhetoric for censorship (vote manipulation complaints, etc.) and did not speak out against it during the only time it mattered. He began saying that he is against censorship in principle (who isn't?) until it became obvious that censorship would not magically remove contention. He often equates the moderation policies of forums and subreddits, which is as insincere as it gets.

"Just yesterday, he posted these comments:


>[I would prefer it if there was no topic moderation, and said this to theymos, firstly because supporting free and open discourse is the right thing to do; and secondly because Streisand effect - even if he considers he is doing a privatised form of public safety warnings in deleting inadvisable promotions - it will obviously still backfire. And for the people knowingly arguing in favour of bad ideas, whether based on normal tradeoff comparisons, or using Streisand as a prop ""must be good because others thought it inadvisable"" to promote in advisable actions, it's all bad - regardless a bad idea is a bad idea. Censorship is bad. Moderation I dislike. Tripping the Streisand effect is obvious and counter-productive. And arguing for people to do inadvisable things is also bad. Lying and spreading misinformation in lieu of technical comparisons is also bad. Seems like there's a lot of bad here. Are you contributing to bad? Or are you a force for good - I think that is the question you need to ask yourself if you want to feel good about your place in the world. I feel very good. Do you? Having a good faith and honest discourse on security tradeoffs, I think you will find, despite false claims of Streisand applying there too - that moderators here do not moderate. But in any case it would be better if there was another forum with less noise, and more good faith, where useful discourse could occur without false flags, Streisand baiting etc. Be part solution: contribute signal, and lead by example: speak in good faith only.](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5sq5fv/contentious_forks_vs_incremental_progress/ddhah8o/)
