Any decentralized blockchain overtaking XRP is good news.  Vitalik has kinda won me over recently, I can see now that he's more for decentralization than anything, and I think that's a good thing for the world even if he does have a kind of cult following.  I'm not convinced in staking, but if he is, good luck to him.;206;6;False;Dixnorkel;ed2t5bz;Congrats to Ethereum for overtaking XRP, seriously. 👏🏼👏🏼;abteqs;https://i.imgur.com/5vewofJ.jpg

">I see no correlation with cults there.

You must not remember the 2017 spike then, people were hailing Vitalik as an all-knowing genius, and the price of ether fluctuated by several hundred dollars simply based on rumors of his death and abandoning eth.

Just because it's not harmful, doesn't mean that crypto cults are a good thing.  Look at Charlie Lee, he potentially tanked the entire market with his dump announcement, and has likely damaged the community irreparably with his juvenile tweets and market manipulation.  The only reason that Vitalik is arguably benevolent is the fact that he advocates for decentralization, which means his importance will be diminished over time as well.";12;1;False;Dixnorkel;ed2w7vl;Congrats to Ethereum for overtaking XRP, seriously. 👏🏼👏🏼;abteqs;https://i.imgur.com/5vewofJ.jpg

"Every Nano holder can add voting power to a representative proportional to the amount of Nano they have. Representatives with high voting power effectively become validators.

There are significant problems with this system:

1. Most people will never change their representative. They will just use whatever is the default on their wallet. Requiring average people to monitor the network and adjust their representative based on its current state is ridiculous.
2. Large holders can conspire and capture the system by choosing malicious representatives. In comparison a large holder in a PoW network has no power to maliciously attack the system.
3. Running a validator requires $ for hardware/bandwidth/electricity etc (it is a tiny fraction of the cost of mining, but it is still there and will grow if Nano grows). Nano doesn't have any mechanism to pay validators for their work. This is an unsustainable system. If they do eventually add a fee mechanism for validators it will have the same problem as DASH: rent-seeking behavior by large holders. The more coins you have the more validating power you have. Your share of fees is totally based on the stake directed at you. There is no competition between entities for those fees like there is in PoW coins. In such a system it is optimal to sit on your hoard and rake in fees. In contrast, the competitive capitalist nature of mining means that the validators (the miners who actually find the blocks) are constantly in flux. In addition, miners are forced to invest extensively in hardware that is only really useful for mining, meaning they have an incentive to not maliciously attack the currency that makes their investment useful. PoS validators have no such investment and suffer no consequences for destroying the currency, they could perform massive double spends/roll backs/chain splits and sell all their coins at any moment.";5;2;False;Rolling_Civ;ed3230b;Congrats to Ethereum for overtaking XRP, seriously. 👏🏼👏🏼;abteqs;https://i.imgur.com/5vewofJ.jpg

Thanks for any answers or guidance.";3;3;False;yourfriendjason;ed2u1oy;Congrats to Ethereum for overtaking XRP, seriously. 👏🏼👏🏼;abteqs;https://i.imgur.com/5vewofJ.jpg
I know the whole coin market is suffering now, but is this development more about the declining strength of XRP or the increasing strength of ETH?;6;3;False;ZippyDan;ed2tlz6;Congrats to Ethereum for overtaking XRP, seriously. 👏🏼👏🏼;abteqs;https://i.imgur.com/5vewofJ.jpg

Their latest narrative is that XRP is still 2nd because the escrow supply should be calculated into it. Maybe I'm wrong, but I'd say if that was displayed it would cause a huge dump to get that mc back to normal (still way too high) levels.;30;4;False;TheRealMotherOfOP;ed2sovm;Congrats to Ethereum for overtaking XRP, seriously. 👏🏼👏🏼;abteqs;https://i.imgur.com/5vewofJ.jpg

">  However it’s true that they could double spend and sell before the  market can react

You pretty much just negated your previous two sentences and agreed with me. 

> Theirs no incentive for running a Bitcoin/Tor/Monero node, yet many people do it. 

Running a full node right now takes relatively little investment and many people do it as a hobby. That will not be the case as bitcoin scales up. That is fine though because only miners need to run a full node, regular users can just use a SPV wallet.

Yes you can transfer out of coinbase. But it requires quite some skill to safely keep the coins yourself. It sounds like you should be studying a bit more to learn about these things. I recommend letting coinbase manage your funds. Also don't sell. When you are ready to control your own funds buy a hardware wallet like a ledger nano s and a place to keep your words like cryptosteel. ;6;1;False;mrreddit;ed2uze7;Congrats to Ethereum for overtaking XRP, seriously. 👏🏼👏🏼;abteqs;https://i.imgur.com/5vewofJ.jpg

My guess is that it's a little of both. ETH has a reduction of issuance slated for around Jan 16th where block rewards will be reduced by a third. That's my two cents. ;3;0;False;ChazSchmidt;ed2xl29;Congrats to Ethereum for overtaking XRP, seriously. 👏🏼👏🏼;abteqs;https://i.imgur.com/5vewofJ.jpg

"I don't think it would be smart to value Eth as a sum of all of its tokens, a lot of them are purposeless hype-riders or scam projects, their market caps aren't really indicative of anything since the ones that are still operating usually have a centralized supply.

It's a very popular choice, because it's one of the only choices.  I'm sure it will remain extremely competitive regardless of what happens in the market though, if only by its sheer lifespan and established history.
