"Proof of work is why bitcoin works. If you abandon PoW when it makes a decision you disagree with, than you disagree with PoW inherently as a decision maker.

Which means a emergency change to PoW due to 'losing' is simply precedent for changing the PoW for any decision Core might disagree with. Defacto **making Core the decider of 'bitcoin' and not PoW.** If rule by committee is what you think bitcoin is, it might benefit you if you would re-learn about bitcoin.

"If two different hash functions are used, then there is no comparable way of measuring length.  You are dealing with to completely separate chains, just as you would be with identical code for a version of Bitcoin except for a different Genesis block.

Actually, it's a little bit more complicated, because a longer hash function might be generated out of a combination of the original hash function and an additional hash function.  There is a possible theory here, and something that might be useful to investigate if it becomes necesssary to migrate away from SHA256 due to some kind of cryptographic break.

Proof of work based on CRC is useless, because CRC is not a cryptographic hash function and can be trivially inverted.  See the following article.

"The ETH/ETC split was a very different thing, and done for very different reasons. That was not a scaling war, but correcting a hack that allowed an attacker to steal a lot of ETH. Some miners did not want to rewrite the chains history and kept mining the original one. 

With the nature of GPU mining as well, ETC was able to split off without much trouble because of how quick difficulty re-targeting is. If 75% hashpower suddenly leaves the 1mb network however, it will take *weeks* for that chain to be usable again without drastic actions from the Core team , seldom producing a block with the now 25% minority hashpower (also dangerously centralized now and totally open to attack). This is why ASIC mining networks are far more robust and decisive than GPU/CPU types (also susceptible to botnets in a way ASICs are not).

Bitcoin's issue is straight up only about scaling, and the very simple change to do that. It is far more a social problem than a technical one. I've argued simply the change in development leadership is more important than just raising the block size at this point.

From your perspective: Mine is the longest valid chain, so therefor i'm the legit one.

We are both correct. The question is which one is ""valid"". The miners will continue to mine whichever one they think is valid. That is mostly influenced by how much money the coins are worth on which chain, as they want to make the most money. What the coins are worth is how much the users are willing to pay for them. So the miners are voting on validity based on the projected market of what the users are projected to demand. If there really are two different user bases that want two different things and the market splits into two different products with miners on both sides, then that's cool too.

Totally. In fact, I really think the world only needs one blockchain. Everything else can bootstrap off of it as long as the underlying protocol is flexible enough to allow it. It's like how the networking world has settled on TCP/IP for the most part: It's pretty good and it's flexible enough that I can work with it. Sure I could write my own protocol and maybe eek out a slight benefit for my use, but if no one else uses that protocol, then I'm just hurting interoperability. As long as the underlying protocol doesn't suck, like say, not turning on your your dark fiber because your business model is in charging fees for QoS to your end users and if you lit up that fiber and let the market find an equilibrium you would be less profitable and because currently hold a monopoly there is no competition to provide a better service with you being in a costly-to-enter industry.

"The evolution of the original client is definitely not ideal in terms of a true ""reference"" client. A lot of it is still to this day pretty hacked together code, Satoshi admitted himself he was a ""gets it done"" kind programmer while creating the prototype. No one ever really went back to rebuild it proper , though there are other implementations like Bcoin and BTCD that are completely new and refined code bases. It seems like one of these would be better to use as a reference client now, definitely now that Core v.14 alters almost everything to add SegWit.

It was a mistake to brand the client and first chain as Bitcoin I think, instead of *bitcoin* in the same parlance we use *linux*, calling the first live chain something else. But I suppose it is far too late to change that now.

I would agree the way the 1mb block was put in place was not very future minded though provisions were added to increase the block size later.

The beauty of sha256 asics is that they can only do bitcoin, and forking away the pow could drastically reduce their mining income and make the hardware useless.

"I don't know... Here's how it my play out in my opinion, and I think a PoW change might actually be a very good idea (or the only idea) in this scenario:

Core is very committed to SegWit and LN. We know that. That's where all there marketing has been going for years. And it's not really a bad idea either and there is certainly demand for a rapid and extremely scalable transmission layer backed by a blockchain. So let's say there is a hard fork to BU and only pretty much their own miners are still on their chain. They are no less legitimate as long as miners and users are following that chain, they are just different. They will likely need to manually reset difficulty with an update, but they can feel free to keep working on that chain. I could hard fork myself today if I wanted to and put my miner on my own chain and there is no one who can stop me nor should there be. But there is one problem with that. My mining potential consists of a few GPUs. Let's say people actually love my fork because of the features and they start using it. How much of AntPool's capacity would it take to absolutely obliterate my burgeoning chain with 51%? With my capacity, probably a single 1U in a rack somewhere. Only option would be to change PoW to something else... especially when there are a lot of pissed off people who hate my fork, not for any technical reasons, but because everyone called each other names on the internet for 2 years.

If the miners follow BU and their dev team doesn't want to follow the miners, that's really their only option. And if an alt coin wants to have at least a lingering slightly successful existence, having a huge base of people already holding their coins and offering some compelling features that aren't in any coin yet with LN and using a mature codebase that is pretty trusted is a good way to do that.

That said, I think it would just be Ripple 2.0 if they did that, but good luck to them.

Just a few days ago he was cheerleading for exchanges to stick with 'core' btc. He's an attention-whore, and a shady personality who got rich via shady methods. He never calls out /r/bitcoin mods for censorship and he never calls out core for supporting that censorship, and he still participates over there.

"This hasn't been the case for a long time. While Bitcoin has the largest hashpower, it is mostly wasted on waiting for the next block. So Ethereum with 15 sec block times is actually more secure than the physically stronger Bitcoin with 10 min block times: https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/555.pdf

TL;DR:  37 Ethereum confirmations (a.k.a. < 10 minutes) are equivalent in security to 10 Bitcoin confirmations (a.k.a. ~ 1.5 hrs).";2;0;False;Josephson247;df6fgxe;"Erik Voorhees: ""Changing Bitcoin's proof-of-work to prevent miners from mining is the most absurd and reckless thing I've heard in the scaling debate.""";60gtdn;https://twitter.com/erikvoorhees/status/843832284797173760
"The majority of users support SegWit from my perspective. It's rare for me to find someone that supports BU especially with their recent fear tactics they've employed to diminish BTC.     
It's not surprising that miners would support BU because BU will not have a lightning network (bad for miners, good for users).";1;0;False;nitrogeneSports;df6qq1w;Why Coinbase didn't sign the industry letter;6060i2;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6060i2/why_coinbase_didnt_sign_the_industry_letter/
Can. But don't in this case. So it basically makes zero difference.;1;0;False;Richy_T;df63kdz;Why Coinbase didn't sign the industry letter;6060i2;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6060i2/why_coinbase_didnt_sign_the_industry_letter/
