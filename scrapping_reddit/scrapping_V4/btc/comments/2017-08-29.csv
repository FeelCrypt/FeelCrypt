"Thank you.  

This will make the ""moderators"" on /r/bitcoin more self conscience of their activity.  Every time they block a post or comment, those making the comment will know.  Before, it was a silent activity and you would not know it was happening, and thus the ""moderators"" would feel safe in hiding comments.  Now every hidden post or auto-hidden post generates more awareness about how content is being censored/hidden.  They can no longer feel safe in hiding or censoring content.

"Hello, and welcome to reddit! 

Let me ask you: are you new to the site, or did you create this account specifically to troll /r/Bitcoin? If the former, then you may want to take some time to read over [reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) and familiarize yourself with the platform. Once your account has aged a bit and built up some history, you'll have an easier time being taken seriously on places like /r/Bitcoin. 

But if you created the account just to troll the Bitcoin subreddit, sorry, you're not welcome there. Good riddance!

"You don't give any of the funds to the middle man though since you're just signing a 2 of 2 hashlocked multi-sig contract with them. So you retain full control of all funds that you didn't agree to pay. There's no third party that can steel your funds.

The middle man helps you route payments but they aren't actually transacting your funds. That's handled on the blockchain and is why LN retains trustlessness. Which is why the middle man can't steel your Bitcoin, because you never gave it to them. Which is why it's still decentralized in the end, it's just not distrusted like onchain is (but that's the point to LN because a distributed across every node can't scale to the extent of a payment channel).

We were always going to have some level of offchain transactions. It'd be much better to be able to do that through the security and trustlessness of LN than do so through an entirely centralized offchain transaction like giving your funds to Coinbase. 


You can think of the payment hub here more as just someone that puts you in touch with people for a finders fee.


While you technically don't need middle men to use a payment channel (as I can do it directly with you) you are right that the majority of users would be going through some third party payment hub and this would be required to some extent to minimize the amount of hops between payment hubs and it's necessary to have enough people on well connected payment hubs to make it viable for every day and 1 day transactions.

"> Why does it trouble you that end users are using Bitcoin exactly as Satoshi suggested in the white paper?

In the best case, those users are running an SPV node. Satoshi described SPV like this:

> ... While network nodes can verify transactions for themselves, the simplified method can be fooled by an attacker's fabricated transactions for as long as the attacker can continue to overpower the network. One strategy to protect against this would be to accept alerts from network nodes when they detect an invalid block, prompting the user's software to download the full block and alerted transactions to confirm the inconsistency. ...

Fraud proofs would add the part described in the second sentence, but that hasn't been implemented yet:

https://gist.github.com/justusranvier/451616fa4697b5f25f60

So if we're going to invoke Satoshi, we should at least quote him in full.

The other thing to note is that many users not running full nodes or SPV nodes are connecting to servers. And that's beyond any security model discussed in the white paper.

"Picture a garden with bunnies in it, the bunnies eat the food, all is well with the world. Now, add more bunnies, there is not enough food for all the bunnies, so some starve to death. This is sad, so you bring them some food, now there are no more starving bunnies, once again, all is well with the world. Eventually you can not bring any more food, when this happens there are now even more starving bunnies then if you had done nothing. What is a person to do if they don't want bunnies to starve then? Well, good question, if giving them food is not helping in the long run then we need to try something else, maybe we could plant more food, or maybe we could relocate the bunnies to a new place where food grows more abundantly, or maybe there is some better solution, I don't know.

 This is the problem with starving kids in Africa, simply giving them food or money is not a long term solution, although it may seem good in the short term. This is the same issue with bigger blocks, yes, it may solve things in the short term, but in the long run it can't work. Right now bitcoin is tiny, miniscule in fact, and slightly bigger blocks, 8mb, even 80mb would work fine, the issue comes in when bitcoin is huge, when the world is operating on bitcoin similar to how it currently operates on the internet, at that point we are talking about needing 8gig blocks or bigger, it won't work. Yes, we could ignore the issue and just start making bigger and bigger blocks, but it is just moving the issue down the road to be dealt with later.

I have a problem with the methods being used to push the agenda of keeping blocks small. The majority of the arguments against increasing the block size don't make sense. If those arguments could stand on their own merits, censoring the debate would be unnecessary. The fact that certain entities must resort to censorship in order to push their agenda is clear indicator of ulterior motives. In my opinion, that alone is sufficient reason for them to be permanently removed from their position of power.

I am against SegWit, because it is simply a bad update. It is a shit ""scaling solution' because it's less efficient than a blocksize increase in terms of increasing transaction capacity.

"Every node validates the signature of every transaction and then if valid propagates it to other nodes. There ends up being a slight delay between the time it takes to validate the transaction and then propagate it. 

With 7 transactions per second this isn't a big issue. However the more onchain transactions there are this means the more signatures must be validated per second and as such the greater bottleneck the CPU becomes and greater latency between propagation of transactions. 

If a more efficient variant of EDSA is used this means signatures can be validated quicker with less resources. Meaning you wouldn't need to have as high end of a CPU for high capacity onchain scaling and we'd see less latency in the prorogation of transactions between nodes.

"You can settle the payment channel whenever you want so no need to wait for the 100th visit, just no need to settle it immediate since a second, third, or forth visit may occur before you want to settle. The above was just a direct P2P example. Things can also get more complicated than a payment channel directly between you and me, you don't need to close the payment channel to take profits or pay expenses.

For example let's say Alice, Bob, James each shop at the same grocer. Alice buys $50 of food, James buys $50 of food, and Bob buys $25 of food. 

 It turns out Bob is Alice's plumber and her sink broke and he fixed it. So Alice owes Bob $50. As for the grocer well he needs to pay for gas after work to get home so Mr. Grocer owes Mr. Exxon $25.

Now we could do this all onchain which would mean Alice, James, Bob each pay the grocer (3 onchain transactions), Alice pays Bob (now we're at 4 onchain transactions), and the grocer pays for gas (5 onchain transactions).


Well why don't we just have Alice pay $100 to the grocer (1 onchain transaction) while James pays $50 to Bob (2 onchian transactions) and Bob pays $25 to Exxon (3 onchain transactions). Now we get the same end result, as far as everyone is concerned they payed who they bought from, and what's on the blockchain has essentially been mixed. So we get greater privacy from mixing coins on the fly and we cut down on some of the bloat on the blockchain making fees lower for us all in the end.

How this works is that initially they would all write a contract to all pay the grocer but this wouldn't be broadcasted onchain immediately, then later in the day when other transactions are made the required participants would write new contracts that invalidate the previous. Then when closing the payment channel this final contract would be broadcasted onchain.

Now you might say why bother with that complicated tech and just scale onchain, why should any participant here use LN if on chain fees are low enough why should the grocer use LN? Well in addition to the privacy (as it's not abundantly clear who actually paid who onchain) and the lower fees the grocer doesn't  need to wait for a confirmation to protect against double spending with LN. So now the grocer has the confidence that there's no double spending so you wont need to wait in line for 10 min which makes both you and the grocer happy.

Hopefully that makes sense to you.";2;2;False;PoliticalDissidents;dm9it2a;"Mike Hearn: ""I don't personally have any interest in working on a system that boils down to a complicated and expensive replacement for wire transfers.

That's like saying try to send your Bitcoin from an exchange to an address of an unknown recipient that may or may not be a licensed or an unlicensed MSB. But you know what?

"Not everyone today can afford to run a node. That will not change under any block size.

Underpowered nodes which cannot scale do not support the network, they hold it back.

> But you really need a hardfork.

Not at all, Bitcoin was specifically designed by Satoshi to support new signature types being added without any break in compatibly. The simplest and most natural way to add a signature type involves no hardfork.
