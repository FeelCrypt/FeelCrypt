"Having recently switched from Chrome/Google to Firefox/DuckDuckGo I can say that DDG has improved a lot in a year since I've last tried to switch. So far 4 days in and not feeling like coming back. (Last time it was 2 hours before I gave up) 

EDIT: as u/265 correctly [mentions](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/bw34e4/a_reminder_why_you_shouldnt_use_google/epw009n/): you don't have to use DuckDuckGo with Firefox. Firefox works well with Google.

Was especially surprised by the fact that Firefox mobile has uBlock Origin (Chrome mobile doesn't).

With the upcoming breakage of uBlock on Chrome desktop - it's a no-brainer to switch.

Oh and if you haven't found it in DuckDuckGo just prepend !g in front of DDG query and you will be taken to Google with the same query.

EDIT: To everybody recommending Brave - you have to understand - Brave uses Chromium. Chromium will deprecate webRequest V3 API and hence will cripple all adblockers including Brave. It won't be completely broken, but severely crippled.

It's so obvious that there will be no result from google if its search service is actually DOWN!";18;1;False;xd1gital;epvmx09;A Reminder Why You Shouldn’t Use Google.;bw34e4;https://i.redd.it/7ssrisizq0231.jpg
