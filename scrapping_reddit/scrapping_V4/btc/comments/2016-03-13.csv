The only constant is core holding bitcoin back through inaction, coercion and censorship. It's easy to conclude alterior motives.  Any reasons offered to support the delay in improving TX abilities have not been communicated well by core or its minister of information.  If that's a misperception then you have to ask why do so many have this perception? The road to hell is paved with good intentions - and that applies to all sides.  It's just hard to be agnostic when the methods core and r/bitcoin moderators have used throughly muddled the ability to have a civilized discussion.

You just described Lightning Network:

A hard fork does nothing of the sort, *which is why there is one in your roadmap.*

However, locking up some percentage of the wealth stored in Bitcoin in another payment system and then transacting on that system very literally splits the ledger: there are all the transactions visible on the blockchain (one ledger) and then all of the transactions visible on Lightning Network (different ledger).

Actually the argument has morphed into an opportunity to evolve from a single centralized development oligarchy to a decentralized free-market development ethos. This might have been a naturally occurring decision point, but Blockstream's efforts to maintain an outsize level of influence over protocol development has brought the issue to the fore.

This is different IMO. North Korea's state apparatus is comical in its evil. A North Korea comparison, especially when referencing a specific subreddit related to North Korea, like /r/pyongyang, is not going to be taken as a serious allegation of having the moral depravity to commit mass murder. It's also far more removed. It's unlikely there are many North Korean nationals reading these posts, for whom they would open old wounds.

"As far as I understand, that ""500k limit"" was relatively nondeterministic, hence the hard fork in clients running the same version / code with different blockstores.  I will admit I haven't studied the specifics of this issue.  I was considering adding a disclaimer saying ""modulo the March 2013 fork"" in my initial comment, but didn't think it would be necessary for a good faith discussion of the original client.  I do agree with the 32 million byte limit, but again this was not necessarily intended as a feature of the design and was a consequence of implementation open to later change, and it remains a feature of Classic as well as Core.  Either way, it's incredibly pedantic and downright disingenuous to claim the hardfork bug as a blocksize limit, a fact of which you are well aware.  


I do agree that the change you linked is bunk, but it's a distraction for two reasons: firstly, it is not even merged yet and likely will never be merged, so I find it misleading and false to point to it as a ""direction Classic is moving"".  Secondly, it's not the issue at hand, and it has little to nothing to do with why anyone would choose to run Classic, or any of the rest of this controversy or discussion.  It also bears no relevance on my original claim that the genesis client would recognize a fork mined by a Classic client as valid.


So my point stands (and will be refined a bit for you to prevent nitpicking and pedantry): modulo the March 2013 forking bug, the genesis client *would* recognize a longest Bitcoin Classic chain as valid, at least to the extent it recognizes the current Core chain as valid.  Given that the key validity difference in the two chains is a rule that was added later to Core's consensus set, this makes Classic closer to the original implementation, design, and vision of the currency when it comes to the definition of a ""valid"" block.

No. It did not. Not even the first release, or the pre-release alpha implementation. No version of Bitcoin _ever_ has limited itself to just that behavior. Nor has even any altcoin that I'm aware of.

The behavior of Bitcoin has always been the first seen longest rule conforming chain is selected. Any blocks which violate the system rules are ignored as a first step, then the first longest one is chosen among them.  If you ignore the possibility of rule violating blocks (a reasonable simplification when discussing the algorithm, since excluding invalidity is trivial-- and in many cases fundamentally necessary for any further processing, then the above simplification would hold-- but the complete system does not make this simplification, has never made this simplification, and would be significantly less secure and viable if it did so.

Pretty much everybody agrees that 2mb is not a problem. If that goes smoothly, we can raise it again (by what method I do not know yet). The point is, if at some point big blocks start to become a problem and really start affecting Bitcoin's performance, that is when we can consider slowing down block growth and moving to off-chain solutions (which will probably be more solid by then).

">I care that they're blockading progress.

I do too. This is why I strongly support a hard fork that takes control over the max block size out of their hands.

I only disagree with one aspect of your viewpoint, not all of it.";1;0;False;aminok;d0xw2g4;Blockstream co-founder Alex Fowler sent a private message to me asking me to remove the Public Service Announcement on NodeCounter.com.

"> None of what you allege is proven to be true. It's an unsubstantiated allegation. What is substantiated: the funding they're providing for open source software that enriches the Bitcoin ecosystem, is good.
The fact is, Core had been stonewalling a max block size increase for years before Blockstream was founded. There is absolutely no evidence the founding of Blockstream had anything to do with the current empasse.

That doesn't mean anything to me. I see people and I see a problem. Whether they're an institution or not doesn't matter.

This is true. In that sense they were harming Bitcoin long before they had a $75 million war chest, and now that they do have it the damage they can do has been appropriately amplified.";2;1;False;;d0xt14z;Blockstream co-founder Alex Fowler sent a private message to me asking me to remove the Public Service Announcement on NodeCounter.com.

That's not true. Gmaxwell was against hasty increases, and Peter Todd was engaged in ""1MB forever"" propaganda, but we can easily pull quotes indicating people were no were near their current positions 2-3 years ago.
