"Ok, I'm not going to state the obvious of whats been going on for the last 24 hours... instead I'm going to ask ""Why don't you?""

Edit: Fine, I believe it is Satoshi because he fulfills a bunch of personal criteria (that I won't go into and probably won't make sense anyway). I have thought Craig was Satoshi since he revealed himself at the conference end of last year. Also because only Jon and Satoshi know of specific things that Satoshi asked Jon in the very early days, I only know of the vague content because Jon told me. I also believe in the character of Gavin (having known of him for years and chatted with him quite a few times). It would have to take some stupidly amazing con to be able to get Gavin and Jon to both put their reputations on the line.

Honestly, the attacks on Gavin (not so much on Jon for some reason) from both sides (Core/Classic) has been rather disheartening. I applaud the people asking for more evidence, if Bitcoin has taught us one thing, it is that of trust. But personally I had enough evidence months ago, this just solidifies it for me. Is the hatred from some corners really needed?

I've dealt with NDA's and secret backroom meetings and similar crap, I have a strong sense of what that can be like. I feel sorry for Gavin and Jon for being placed in this position, I feel sorry for them for the hatred and venom thrown at them just for respecting Craig's wishes of privacy and the ""please let me do the announcing"". It placed them in a shit position, I feel even more sorry for Craig that he had to do this in the first place.

I do wish things were just a steady one way track as they were years ago and the vitriol and hatred could be left outside the door as we all explored this wonderful technology together...

Andreas is right in a way that it doesn't matter who created it, he is amazingly right in many ways, he's also a key reason why the UK has its regulations the way they are (though he doesn't know it) and hence why Craig (assuming Satoshi) moved to London, thanks Andreas.

But since Blockstreamcore has used the 'appeal to authority' method so much over the last year, it seems that the only way to stop their destructive path is to take that away from them. I don't see Craig's 'outing' as a new 'appeal to authority', but rather a 'dont appeal to blockstreamcore authority, because it is wrong'.

I hope Craig can disappear back to silence and focus on what he loves doing, I hope Bitcoin can get back on one track and we can all start moving in the same direction again, I hope the hatred and enmity towards everyone in the space can be put aside (there is far too much), and I hope that everyone continues to develop and spread wonderful things.

"I agree with you to a point, but in the last almost 6 years since I've discovered Bitcoin, I've found that this community can rip people to shreds when they find something they don't like and it only takes a tiny bit of doubt for people to go on a crusade. 

Right now Bitcoin is an unfinished project, and so long as it is unfinished, it will be vulnerable to corruption, we've seen plenty of it in recent years and these special interests are dismantling a system whose roots were based on never needing a group or organisation to plan it's future operation, but that is what we have right now. *IF* Craig is Satoshi, he could set things straight so that Bitcoin can live up to what I dreamed it could be (yes, I believe in this case we NEED an appeal to authority as Bitcoin in an unfinnished state is vulnerable to corrupt groups), and the entrenched interests will find anything to discredit the real Satoshi if he ever came forward and had a viewpoint that clashed with them. The incumbents are devoid of moral integrity, and have the complete undivided attention of the miners. Having reputed people in the Bitcoin community independently verify his identity can freeze vitriolic ad hominem attacks in their tracks and makes it extremely hard to smear a person (although you can already see Theymos and the hate brigade are already hard at work).

That said, I wish he'd damn well hurry up and release some online proof so it's done, independent verification is great and all but it's pretty moot if everyone else can't be satisfied either.
