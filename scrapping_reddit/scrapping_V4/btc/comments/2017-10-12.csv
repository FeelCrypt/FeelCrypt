They also straight out lie, but relatively rarely; it's good enough to selectively choose facts.

The best is to do independent research, but you can only do that in very narrow domains. And this is exploited by the media, because each of us can do our own independent research and get closer to the truth in one narrow domain, so they are free to feed us misinformation for all the other domains.

"**Appeal to ridicule**

Appeal to ridicule (also called appeal to mockery, ab absurdo, or the horse laugh), is an informal fallacy which presents an opponent's argument as absurd, ridiculous, or humorous, and therefore not worth consideration.

Appeal to ridicule is often found in the form of comparing a nuanced circumstance or argument to a laughably commonplace occurrence or to some other irrelevancy on the basis of comedic timing, wordplay, or making an opponent and their argument the object of a joke. This is a rhetorical tactic that mocks an opponent's argument or standpoint, attempting to inspire an emotional reaction (making it a type of appeal to emotion) in the audience and to highlight any counter-intuitive aspects of that argument, making it appear foolish and contrary to common sense. This is typically done by making a mockery of the argument's foundation that represents it in an uncharitable and oversimplified way.

"> 80% of the industry supports my implementation when you look at the market share of the other two bitcoins

I base ""support"" .... on the # of users who are influenced by the major players in the industry.  For example:  Coinbase makes decisions for easily 80% of the entire userbase.  Hundreds of thousands of new users every week.  I dare say BitPay controls 95% of the merchant space.  They are the largest merchant processor in Bitcoin, with tens of thousands of merchants under their wings.  

***And you guys just blacklisted both of them.*** 

That's only two companies.  There were another 30 on that list.  And you've still got the large # of miners who have publicly stated they do not support Core.    Those numbers don't come even close to matching your statement that ""80% supports Core"".  Maybe we determine influence differently.  I strongly feel that if you burn bridges with the biggest players in the industry, you are playing with fire.  And I strongly believe if you cut out Coinbase, BitPay, and a huge % of miners, you are left with almost nothing in this ecosystem.

>destroy the credibility of this sub and manipulate facts to further an agenda away from what I percieve to be the true bitcoin, the bitcoin that promises freedom from banks and poor fiscal policy for all.

With all due respect, you are very confused.  A bitcoin that forces transactions into ""Trusted 3rd Party Hubs"" is the literal opposite of a Bitcoin that gives freedom from banks.  It literally creates the infrastructure for centralized control over transactions rather than keeping it on-chain.  It continues to confound me that human beings can be so ass-backwards in their understanding of things like this.  If you want freedom from banks, then you need a decentralized system that processes transactions across millions of nodes on-chain.  This is the only way that it can be ""unstoppable"".  You push everything into for-profit third party processing centers and you not only eliminate centralization, you introduce trust into a system that was intended to be trustless, and power control over something that was supposed to be fully diluted.

>If you also covet that type of bitcoin, I'd be wary of anyone pulling you away from the developers who have stuck to that true vision since bitcoins inception.

Now I'm really confused.  Are we on the same team here?  Because Bitcoin Cash is that vision.  Bitcoin Core is not that vision. How can you possibly say that Developers who laugh at the concept of ""peer to peer cash"" are staying true to Bitcoin?   People who mock users for saying they want to buy a coffee with Bitcoin, as if this is now the biggest joke in town.  People who censor thoughts and opinions to the tune of literally hundreds of users.  How are people like that supporting a system that uses math to avoid abuse of power?   There are so many elements to the core mindset and media outlets right now that are diametrically opposed to the vision Satoshi had, its scary.  They've gone so far off track that claiming they've ""stayed true"" is almost comedy at this stage.  The last thing I will ever do is worship the developers.  As Gavin Andresen (also blacklisted by your team) recently said:  There are many developers out there who can do this.  Core is hardly the only group.

"> Bitcoin rising should not be seen as a good thing if you're a BCH maximalist

Wrong.  Bitcoin is not the software running it.  Nor is Bitcoin ""Core"" or ""Greg Maxwell"" or ""SegWit"".  

The software can change.  The miners can change.  Bitcoin is a movement and a ledger that is kept in-tact through all the fighting and forks.   BCH maximalists (white paper proponents) want Bitcoin to succeed because whatever the market decides in the end, Bitcoin is independent of the political drama. 

In the real world, nobody cares about our infighting.  They will just continue to use ""Bitcoin"".  The only people who care about Bitcoin failing are the ones who are opposed to the entire experiment.  In that sense, we are all on the same team.

You'd have to be quite unintelligent to miss out on this opportunity.  Masses of people are cashing in alts and BCH to take advantage of it.  

The price drop does not indicate BCH is failing.  Though I am not surprised you are here pushing that narrative.  Its convenient for you.  I know.  You guys flooded this sub a month ago when the price dipped a whole $100 as well.  Declaring the end of BCH.  Then the price rebounded and you all retreated to your caves.

"You would find more positive stories about Trump in outlets of the opposite bias, in the top features stories, than you find here. Also pay careful notice to the way the titles are phrased and what emotions are they trying to evoke in the reader:

""X pushes back against a reputable report"". NBC (still reputable) done a full research and filed a report that X wants to increase nuclear bombs (a very bad act), and X is ""pushing back"" on it. But of course he will, the little devil, it makes sense to us. The reader becomes focused in the alleged ""push back"", and completely neglects to check the NBC report itself.
You can see the same technique being used here, about the B-3 bombers: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vp_WfB2yKD4

The same analysis can be done for the other two titles. All 3 are of the same side of the bias, they don't even try to alternate. And in a way they have to, because their readers are likely to be supporting that line, and would be violently frustrated if someone would just suggest that what they were parroting _might_ be false, and that they should actually think for themselves (see the message below with the F word so early this evening for a typical reaction).

I saw the iOS app you can store it on. But is that safe? Also are their ways to buy bitcoin with out having to pay the fees every time?

Consider it a chance to learn something. Think back and reflect on what made you decide to buy substratum. Who sold it to you.

Why do you think it will succeed given how many exchanges are pulling out of the NYA? I'm not disagreeing necessarily but is the only reason people still expect it to succeed because miners primarily support it?

It was never supposed to be about price. You still have X bitcoins. The goal was to abandon fiat and create a coin that was a super set of all use cases for money. No value has been added, because no new use cases have been added. Utility has declined for Bitcoin over the last year.

"People are preparing for the fork. Every alt coin is dropping in value right now. Everyone I know has stocked up on BTC and plans to cash back out later. 

Brigading this sub isn't going to help your cause.  I am confused by how much effort is put into this, considering how few Bitcoiners around the world even read these posts.  

However, when your team publicly lies to the entire world on Bitcoin.org and states that Coinbase and BitPay no longer support Bitcoin - I fear you guys are in a world of trouble soon.  

Creating bad blood has been the hallmark of your movement from Day 1, so this is nothing new, but ultimately I do believe you'll find that Cobras post was the turning point for the final downward spiral of your implementation of Bitcoin software.";6;2;False;BitttBurger;do9n956;5000 BABY!!!!;75vksk;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/75vksk/5000_baby/

- [TRUE] ""censorship"": have you actually looked at the forum, subreddit, etc?
- [TRUE] ""narrative engineering"": You can't deny that Clogscreamcore runs coordinates campaigns to shape the narrative in their favor.
