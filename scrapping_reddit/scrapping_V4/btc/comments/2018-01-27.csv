"There is a good wallet called Electron Cash https://electroncash.org/ and the available OS is at the bottom of the page.

When you run it the first time, it will ask if you want to create a wallet or restore. Pick Create.  It will provide you with 13 words.  You need to write these down and save them somewhere safe.  It is not recommended to keep them on your computer or DropBox or anywhere online, because these are able to provide access to your wallet should you change computers.  Anyone with access to these words will have access to spend your coins.

After you verify that you did the backup, indicate that you want to encrypt the file and use a password.  If you lose this password, those backup words earlier will give you access (create a new wallet and repeat this process with the 'restore' option).  Congratulations! You have a wallet!   

Click on the Receive tab and it will show you a bitcoin cash public address. Copy the entire address (if it starts with 'bitcoincash:' that can be copied, too).

Now, to transfer your BCH from tippr in Reddit:  Send a DM to user 'tippr' with a message 'help', and it will reply with instructions.  Do a 'balance' command (we'll need the amount to transfer in BCH).  Reply to tippr with the message 'withdraw amount address' (using the amount from the 'balance' command - or any portion of it) and the receive address from Electron Cash.  

You should see a message from tippr that the funds were sent, Electron Cash will also tell you about it.  Use the 'History' tab to see the transaction.  It will take a few minutes to receive a confirmation, but you have Bitcoin Cash in your very own wallet!

"If Starbucks were ever to accept cryptocurrencies, they would build their own, at least in the current landscape. So many short sighted people here thinking this means Starbucks will accept some random existing currency.

If you think this way, it just means you think the CEO of starbucks care more about get rick quick scheme more than turning his empire into something larger. The CEO of Starbucks doesn't care much about ""getting rich quick"" because he's already rich. He cares more about dominating the world with his product and leaving a legacy.

This means, they probably would have accepted Bitcoin if its dominance was at around 90% because they consider it a public utility (since no one owns it), but not anymore. When there is no clear winner and everybody is building their own currency, it's in their best interest to at least try building their own. Even if they fail they will have learned a lot. They already have top expertise with micropayments and one of the most innovative companies with mobile payments. 

Think about it, as the CEO of Starbucks, you look at all these amateurs with nothing but a whitepaper claiming to disrupt the future of money when they have no experience, while Starbucks themselves already knows pretty much everything about challenges with payments. There's a reason why everyone uses ""Starbucks"" example when they talk about micropayments.

They've been super innovative with technology, so the first instinct will be to try to think of ways to implement their own coin instead of using some half-assed coins (No offense to any coins, but I'm just speaking from Starbucks' point of view.)

The only way Starbucks will start accepting an existing cryptocurrency is if one of them ends up dominating just like the Internet did. I personally hope Bitcoin gets back to that status rather than some coffee company taking over, but it's not a terribly unlikely scenario at this rate.";0;1;False;edoera;dtbpzjj;"Starbucks CEO Wants Crypto.

"Yah could be.  I also read it as basically saying that they have no idea what crypto to accept but they would like some of the action.  Waiting for market leader or second layers to show them de whey.  Nobody wants to sell precious bitcoin for a consumable Starbucks anyway, it's worth too much to use for stuff like that.  Just like gold, Im not going to melt out some of my gold just to buy a coffee...it's much too valuable.  Everytime Ive spent bitcoin in the past Ive kicked myself later.  May as well use a cheaper coin that's faster or once LN is larger just use your BTC through a channel.  I assume that until BTC hits prices like 40k to 100k and eventually stabilizes more from growth it will not be used in this way, because the incentive is not there.  Why spend it if the price is most likely going to rise so much due to it's enforced scarcity and original conception?  BTC will continue to be the gold reserve of crypto, regardless.  A lot of these other coins are more based on ""fast and free utility"" and can be used and abused all day (their enforced scarcity and method of creation/distributions are less important qualities than they are to bitcoin).  You don't need to hold them, you just pinch off some BTC from your Savings into one of them as your Checkings every once in awhile if you need to.  It wouldn't even matter which new tech you use at a certain point because they will all virtually act the same to the end user in payment procedure....eventually BTC will be right there with them in ease, speed and fees but not until second layer solutions when there is more stability at higher market cap will people want to use bitcoin for small things like that.";7;0;False;6_33_6;dtbynp1;"Starbucks CEO Wants Crypto.

"Yes, it's possible. But it's up to the merchant / payment processor to take the risk and assess it. A double spend from above script (sending first tx to merchant node, the double spend to everyone else shortly thereafter) can quite easily be detected by a well-connected node. It'll see the double spend coming from somewhere else some milliseconds later.

And yes: 0-conf is good enough for small payments.

I would personally accept 0-conf after waiting 7 seconds for payments up to $1000. I remember the mycelium wallet even had a ""tx confidence status bar"". They were detecting double spend attempts with their backend nodes and judging the spreading of the tx to the miners.

I'm not saying 0-conf works reliably 100% of the time. Noone is denying the theoretical possibility of a double spend. I'm just saying: let the merchant / payment processor assess and take the risk on a case-by-case basis.

"Not true. RBF does affect the viability of 0-conf:

1. RBF is not opt-in for the merchant who must reject the customer if they use RBF and rejecting customers for any reason is bad for business.

2. RBF robs the merchant of crucial over-the-counter-trade seconds destroying 0-conf's speed advantage over other fast payment systems such as paywave which can mean the difference between fastest trade in its class or mediocre. 

3. RBF requires additional staff training to properly deal with any customer attempting to use RBF and just explaining the concept of RBF to merchants is difficult.

"An /r/bitcoin 'er once told me BCH miners are still technically able to support RBF, that it's not something clients/nodes can disable. The miner would just ignore the cheaper fee transaction and include the higher fee transaction. They might need to change some code but the network would see it as valid.

You seem like a knowledgable fellow with regards to RBF, is this true, and can you explain why (not) ?

"> the US, having the petrodollar and largest military, is a fairly secure bet for the future. Sweden, only having the the umbrella of the EU is a more risky bet.

I would agree in the situation of an all out free for all WW3. But that has not happend (yet) thankfully. Sweden has managed to remain 'neutral' for over two centuries, that is they have not actively waged any wars since 1814.

Not having to spend on war and military but instead exporting those goods to other countries has been a key to the success Sweden has experienced.

[Take a look at this site:](https://www.starcapital.de/en/research/research-in-charts/) you'll love it. It breaks down PE and adjust it cyclically and shows expected returns depening on region,  sector and market valuation.

[Read this pdf in particular](https://www.starcapital.de/fileadmin/user_upload/files/publikationen/Research_2016-01_Predicting_Stock_Market_Returns_Shiller_CAPE_Keimling.pdf) 

It shows how well Sweden and Denmark has performed compared to other markets. In fact, they have outperformed 'safe havens' such as great britain, us etc. by a big margin. Look at the dot plot/chart on the top of page 11.

For some reason nordic markets have resulted in postitive returns even on ridiculously high valuations of CAPE 30 which is not only impressive but astounding. (CAPE 30 is what 1929 was and CAPE has only been higher on one occasion since 1880. It lasted three years and had a CAPE of 45; I'm talking about the IT/.com/millenium tech bubble.)
