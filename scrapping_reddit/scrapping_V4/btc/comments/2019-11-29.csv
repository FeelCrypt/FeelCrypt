"since there is no ""official"" antifa, there is no ""they"", just individuals who self-label.  My racist parents and grandparents used to consider all ""civil rights activists"" to be the equivalent of the Black Panthers.  it is important to think critically on these subjects.

Antifa means ""antifascist"".  You will, understandably, only hear about the antifascists who ""act up""

some of them are certainly misguided antifascists.

others are clearly plants, intended to throw shade on antifascism, and thus soften opposition to fascism

the lesson of history in re: pacifism is unfortunately clear.  One cannot stand peaceably exercising their ""right to free speech"" for very long, in the face of opposition who will use violence and oppression to eliminate the right to free speech.

and not all forms of speech are protected, with reason.  Nazism is violence enshrined as politics.  Violence-inducing speech is a form of speech which (IMO) does not meet the definition of ""protected speech"".  

I agree this is a complicated topic.

Edit: Also, it is quite literally impossible that ""antifa"" is ""facist"" since antifa, not even being a formal organization, is as anarchical as a group of people can be; whereas facism is characterized by a rigid hierarchy that extends from the charismatic leader down through the government and into all aspects of life.

"Smart contract functionality on ETH allows a lot of cool features. Lets say I want to trade my ETH for LINK tokens, or I want to trade for DAI or something. To do this, there are many services as the ecosystem is expanding. One service has integrated into the main ethereum wallets so you can do it straight from the wallet.

I can go straight to myetherwallet, or mycrypto.com. I log in with my trezor or ledger, or my chrome extension metamask. I click the swap tab and click on which token I want to trade. It's all done on chain and you can watch your eth go into the smart contract, get swapped for your token of choice and watch it go back into your wallet. This way, you never compromise the security of eth on your trezor but you can still interact with dapps.

This is only the beginning. If you own your DAI (stablecoin built on eth, always wroth 1 USD) you can go to compound.finance and say I want to lend my DAI and earn 7 percent interest on that dai. Same thing, do it from your trezor, and your interest is paid to you into your trezor. 

Many other cool things, (on chain leveraged longs or shorts, collectibles etc) so it becomes cumbersome to use other coins as much as I believe in BCH (been in crypto since 2013)

Just today I listed a collectible for auction using a smart contract on chain. The collectible never leaves my wallet. People can bid on my item in eth. At the end of 7 days I take the highest bid (and I’ve set a minimum bid). If no bid the auction is cancelled. I feel safer not letting a third party hold my item as it is selling for 10+ eth";2;0;False;Pasttuesday;f9364u8;Vitalik Buterin to Core Maxi: “ok bitcoiner” ....;e2wr9i;https://i.redd.it/gfvsxjruve141.jpg
