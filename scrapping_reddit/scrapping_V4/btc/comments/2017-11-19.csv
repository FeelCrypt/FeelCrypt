there you can see, from left to right, a centralized, a decentralized, and a distributed network.

Keeping block size small keeps the network more DISTRIBUTED, not decentralized. bigger blocks means less people can run full nodes making the network look more like the image in the center, a DECENTRALIZED NETWORK. Those who can run full nodes keep the network decentralized. It would only be centralized if suddendly all nodes were controlled by one party, which is absurd when you have people all around the world running full BCH nodes, its impossible for one party to own the majority of them.

"The argument that currencies MUST be stable is pretty falacious, every single country in the world has some sort of inflation due to the absurd laws of banking, some have moderate inflation, some have incredibly stupid high inflation, and people just change prices accordingly. Venezuela is an example, where the minimum wage was 40.000Bs in january and right now its 400.000Bs (which is less money than the 40k were in january lol), is this good? obviously not, but im just pointing out that people learn to deal with unstable inflationary currencies, dealing with an unstable DEFLATIONARY one is easier. 

But also, as time goes on Bitcoin gets less volatile, yeah people freak out when it hits 7k then drops to 4.5k then goes up to 7.5k buts thats pretty ""stable"" compared to the old days when it would go from 8$ to 30$ then go as low as 3$.  And as time goes on it will get less volatile, but still deflationary, at around 5-10% deflation per year it would be pretty ideal as a currency. 

The whole ""Store of value"" is pretty ridiculous, gold is a store of value but gold is pretty, and is also useful for several stuff, making jewellery, scientific studies of electromagnetism, building high quality audio cables, building high quality movable parts inside things like clocks etc, etc. Bitcoin is only pretty for us geeks who see the beauty in the genius of how it works, but if you cant use it to pay for stuff, its useless, its not a store of value because you cant do shit with it, its a ponzi.";9;3;False;lrc1710;dq1ujze;"r/bitcoin mods removed top post: ""The rich don't need Bitcoin.

All you people who think bitcoin is a 'solution' to problems are delusional. Bitcoin will never get accepted as a form of currency and because of that it will never be usable in daily transactions. One reason is difficulty in daily use but that can be fixed through technical improvements. The bigger issue is the ridiculous volatility of the currency. A currency MUST be stable, which bitcoin is not. Bitcoin and all its clones are being held up by nothing but speculation. Nobody knows when or where it will hit its roof. All you investment 'experts' have had an easy time since its been mostly an uphill climb in price but that will end.;6;8;False;iLiZiUM;dq1tjb4;"r/bitcoin mods removed top post: ""The rich don't need Bitcoin.

"Your arguments are not very strong.

The difficulty in daily use one you shoot down yourself.

As for the volatility...it's in its infancy. If the world adopted it it would be a hell of a lot more stable. And in time it will get more mature and more stable as more people invest in it and understand it. Right now we're in the manipulation early stages...and it's in a hostile environment where countries/governments/controlling banks etc all have a lot to lose if Bitcoin succeeds with regards to control over the people, industry etc. 

But that is not to suggest that should that battle sway into Bitcoins favour that we wouldn't see major stability in the market. As soon as funny money fiat collapses there won't be some giant bankers with printed money able to manipulate the system as easily as now.

A currency must transact. It doesn't have to be stable. Every currency eventually becomes unstable. Every currency has moments of instability. Geez, the Canadian dollar gained and lost like 33% of its value in a year multiple times. 

All currency is held up by nothing but speculation. Your currency itself does nothing. It's just a con. People have confidence that if they accept $5 for something they will be able to spend it somewhere else and get something with a similar value. The moment they lose that confidence you have runs on the bank, hyperinflation, depressions, you name it. Chaos. We've seen it happen many many many times in history.

The price will almost certainly crash. Some coins will certainly die out completely (go to $0).

But not for reasons that the technology or use as currency isn't functional. 

Mostly because it's under attack. So pick your side. Truth or deception.

Many people get rich on deception. Many people live better lives in truth though. ";14;0;False;Aro2220;dq22970;"r/bitcoin mods removed top post: ""The rich don't need Bitcoin. The poor do""";7dzqhm;https://i.redd.it/ecye6mgwnwyz.png

Also we all are sexually attracted to intelligent people, no women or man will find stupid people attractive for their stupidity... no being intelligent is an attractive attribute so with no effort by ourselves we want the most intelligent mate we can find.

Im not saying intelligence is all we are attracted too, looks and social status all play a role. But things like humor, respect among peergroups, being successful are all signs of intelligence.

"Right, but the same is true for white people. That doesn’t change my point. If all you knew about a person is their IQ, you would have a very hard time figuring out their race, and vice versa.

Also, you and I (two white people) have very different brain size, IQ, skin tone, bone density, muscle mass, testosterone, hair color, eye color, etc. Every human (except for identical twins) is genetically and environmentally different from every other human. That doesn’t imply one “race” is better than another.

I’m glad you brought up dogs, because they are such a good counter to race based eugenics.

Dog breads were artificially selected for by humans. People wanted dogs that looked or acted a certain way, so they bread the dogs that exhibited the characteristics they were looking for.

Now let’s compare that to race based eugenics. You claim to want the human race to become more intelligent. If this were truly your goal, we know exactly how to go about achieving that. Test everyone for intelligence, and breed those with the highest IQ. Instead, you are suggesting that we test for skin color, and breed the whitest people.

Think about that for a second. Surely you must acknowledge that there are in fact stupid white people. And you’ve already acknowledged that black people can be intelligent as well. If you’re breeding for intelligence, why are you going about in such as slow way?

White people have mostly in-group bred for thousands of years. Sure, there’s been some genetic drift into Europe from Africa and Asia, but clearly that wasn’t substantial, or else white people would already be a lost cause. After all, you seem quite convinced that any substantial interracial breeding would taint the white race passed redemption, right?

So, if white people haven’t bred too much with other races, why aren’t we super smart already? We’ve essentially had a whites only eugenics policy for millennia, yet none of the great leaps that you promise us have yet to come.

Why is that? Humans have used similar techniques to radically change dogs within a single human life time. Why won’t it work on us, and if it hasn’t yet, what is going to suddenly change that?";2;1;False;Darkeyescry22;dq1rl6o;"r/bitcoin mods removed top post: ""The rich don't need Bitcoin.

[Ask me in six months; I don't trust my own judgement right now after all the drama.](https://mobile.twitter.com/gavinandresen/status/728316830683639808)

Six months later he published this [blog post](http://gavinandresen.ninja/either-or-ignore): 

>Now that six months have gone past, I’m being asked if I still think Craig Wright was Satoshi.

> I think there are two possibilities.

> Either he was Satoshi, but really wants the world to think he isn’t, so he created an impossible-to-untangle web of truths, half-truths and lies. And ruined his reputation in the process.

> If he was Satoshi, we should respect his wish to remain anonymous, and ignore him.

> The other possibility is he is a master scammer/fraudster who managed to trick some pretty smart people over a period of several years.

> In which case everybody except the victims of his fraud and law enforcement working on behalf of those victims should ignore him.

> So, either he was or he wasn’t. In either case, we should ignore him. I regret ever getting involved in the “who was Satoshi” game, and am going to spend my time on more fun and productive pursuits.

You forget that miners are also full nodes and the largest miners participate in a global ultrafast relay network.

If one miner mines a block, all miners get it, whether or not a bunch of UASF full nodes agree. 

If one miner receives a transaction, all miners receive that transaction, whether or not a bunch of UASF full nodes agree.

UASF nodes do have the ability to get in the way of users by launching Sybil attacks against the network; pretending to be an impartial relay, but in reality engaging in censorship of transactions and blocks produced by real users and real miners. If enough of these cheap UASF ""full"" nodes clog up the network, it can be harder for real users to find real mining nodes who can validate their tx and get it into a block.

That’s what con artists *do*. They lead people down a path, telling them what they want to hear, making them feel like they are in the driving seat. Jon Matonis got scammed. Gavin got scammed.

Because note that after Gavin had relayed the story of the convoluted “proof” Craig offered him, most people with common sense already suspected Craig was a fraud. There was no rational reason for the theatrics he had insisted on.

So does it go like this:  

* Craig provided his weirdly convoluted proof to Gavin.  

* Then realised he didn’t want the attention.  

* *Then* provided fake proof to the media to cement his status as an obvious conman.  

* Then went quiet for a while before coming back with a PR company, army of sockpuppets, and frequent more subtle hints that he still want people to believe he is Satoshi.

We will continue this atrocity propaganda, we will increase it until nobody will accept one good word from the Germans anymore, until everything is destroyed which might have upheld them sympathies in other countries, and until they will be so confused that they don’t know what to do anymore. When this is reached, when they begin to pollute their own nest, and this not reluctantly but with hasty willingness to obey the winners, only then the victory is complete. It will never be definite.

It's a false premise there are cheap and fast ways to send money both from outside of the Philippines and inside the Philippines. Very cheap and a hell of a lot more convenient the BCH/BTC whatever and no where near 40% fees. Total nonsense. I live in the Philippines (from America). The BTC/PHP rate given by the exchanges are shit anyway, even without fees. And yes, using a foreign ATM card from Charles Schwab is one of the best ways. No ATM fees (they refund them) and the exact Visa exchange rate which is very close to the wholesale, it doesn't get any better than this. www.transferwise.com is also great. Stop using supposedly disenfranchised poor people to promote crypto, it's nonsense. The people who don't have accounts here do so not because they can't, they just don't know any better and have no use for it often. They need education more than crypto fucking currency. Rookies. The idiot in that screenshot is using a standard wire transfer that's about the worst way to send money to anyone in any country. In the Philippines there are 100's of options better than this. In fact I don't even believe that poster really send money to his mother that way, EVERYONE here knows better ways than a freaking wire-transfer.

"You can see many common, real-world Monero transactions on that page. It indicates typical (non-coinbase) transactions in Monero are currently about 13kB each when using a ring size of 5. Right now the median size of a Bitcoin transaction is 226 bytes, so 13,000 / 226 = 57.522.... This means that all the trouble Bitcoin (SegWit) is encountering with scaling right now could happen roughly 57.5x faster on the Monero network as usage grows.  

To be fair, though, Monero does not self-impose a ridiculous 1 MB block size limit, and they are not afraid of hard forks as they have them regularly scheduled every six months.  

So it boils down to how big a problem you think scaling is. In Bitcoin, Blockstream and Bitcoin Core will have you believe that it's a major incoming disaster. If that's true, then it's also about 57.5x worse for Monero.  

On the other hand, Ethereum, Monero, and Bitcoin Cash will all apparently permit on-chain scaling to grow much as Satoshi Nakamoto originally intended for Bitcoin. With the growth of technological capability over time, there might never be scaling problems for any of the three. But if transaction growth exceeds the increases from technological improvement and possible protocol innovations (and layer 2, etc.), scaling still could be a problem even with on-chain block size increases allowed. Of the three Bitcoin Cash has the leanest transaction sizes, followed by Ethereum (as it must include overhead to be a ""decentralized platform for applications"" rather than just ""A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System""), but Monero is significantly larger than either. Even on Ethereum, [data growth is starting to be a concern as compared to Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash](https://i.stack.imgur.com/W0DJu.png).

"> Industry standard

There's your problem right there. And further reading turns up this gem:

>Though most banks offer this facility free of cost to encourage paperless payment system, ICICI bank and Axis bank charge for it as per their respective NEFT charges.

Again though, IMPS seems to be a system that, like all the Indian systems, relies on RTGS which is not 24/7?

So to be able to use IMPS, you are relying on the bank being able to access the other systems as well. It is a layer that requires trust to exist BETWEEN BANKS. If there's a crisis of some kind, and the banks refuse to deal with each other, IMPS will be one of the first services to get switched off.

Everything is layers on layers and different from bank to bank. There are fees and costs, it's just that in India with a BILLION possible customers, the banks can eat the fees in return for giving customers shit interest rates and nickel-and-dime-ing everying else.

Please don't be fooled by the banks. Bitcoin needs to address its costs and transaction times, but at least the TRUE COST is (almost) completely transparent (my understanding is that block rewards currently subsidise the small transactions anyway).

"A) True. The value transacted has no relevance. That's like saying if you pull $300 out of an ATM, the $5 transactions fee is only 1.66%.

B) We can see fees greater than $40 that are occurring literally right now: https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/transactions?q=fee_usd(40..)

C) That you had a transaction that cost $1.27 as something ok is weird. Even that ""small"" fee destroys a ton of blockchain business's models. These same models that grew the network triggering Metcalf's law.

>Even at the height of the first BCH pump, when the BTC mempool was absolutely jammed, the largest fee I had to pay was $18.

Again, this is just the beginning. Unless people aren't transacting (simply buying and keeping on exchanges which seems to be a reasonable thing for most recent ""investors"") this scenario is just going to go up, and by the narrative coming from core dev's and uncensored voices, is by design: higher is better.

>But the argument is made that this is the permanent, eternal fee, and that no one will be able to use Bitcoin at all without pay $40 in transaction fees and that's not true, and saying that obscures the real problem and the real debate.

I disagree. This is the inevitable result of full blocks. ";1;0;False;SecDef;dq1p9au;"""The rich don't need Bitcoin. The poor do. I already can transfer millions instantly.

"> Bitcoin Cash actually uses the BIP143 (quadratic hashing) fix for all transactions, so there! :P

Indeed, which is a very nice improvement but in Bitcoin since non-segwit txn are limited to 1MB by consensus (and 100KB by standardness rules) it doesn't make a critical difference.  (N^2 isn't a big deal when N is small).  Over time, most signatures in Bitcoin will eventually use segwit.  Bitcoin survived thus far with the quadratic stuff combined with the old limit, it'll be fine to phase it in over time.

The cost of that change is that they had to invalidate all timelocked transactions, which cost some people their coins on the fork.  That isn't something Bitcoin could have realistically done, at least not without a really long warning period.";3;2;False;nullc;dq12w4z;"""The rich don't need Bitcoin. The poor do.

"Jesus Christ the more I read up on this the more byzantine it becomes. RTGS seems to be the original system that got all this craziness rolling. 

As far as I can tell, India's problem is that along with its billion people it also seems to have about a billion banks! And these systems have become essential to keep the money moving around at all since without them it would get choked to death by bureaucracy (and we all know about India and bureaucracy!).

You seem fixated on whether or not a service is *truly* instant or is *really* available 24/7... me, I'd be more worried about how IMPS is operated and co-ordinated by a single corporation:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Payments_Corporation_of_India

I mean sure it's nationalised to some extent and it's not-for-profit (ha - I'm more interested in the ""owned by a consortium of major banks"" part) but just look at the mess of different systems: there's the ""National Automated Clearing House"" and the ""Aadhaar Payments Bridge System"" and the ""Cheque Truncation System"" and RuPay and the ""Unified Payments Interface""...

This last one appears to be the backbone of the government's push to make India a ""cashless society"" (presumably whether India wants to be or not), and this description of UPI should send shivers up the spine of anyone who is not a superfan of central banks:

>UPI is built over Immediate Payment Service (IMPS) for transferring funds. Being a digital payment system it is available 24*7 and across public holidays. Unlike traditional mobile wallets, which takes a specified amount of money from user and stores it in its own accounts, UPI withdraws and deposits funds directly from the bank account whenever a transaction is requested. It uses Virtual Payment Address (a unique ID provided by the bank), Account Number with IFS Code, Mobile Number with MMID (Mobile Money Identifier), Aadhaar Number, or a one-time use Virtual ID. An MPIN (Mobile banking Personal Identification number) is required to confirm each payment.

Fuck. That.

So once again, you the customer think you are getting real instant transfers of your money, but this only works because a ""consortium of major banks"" has agreed to be part of a central corporation that manages it all. It's like the surface-level functionality of crypto with a philosophy that is almost satirically antithetical to it.

Okay, *fine*, if it's important to you - I will allow that in India the push for a cashless society by the government (and I assume the banks) is so strong that the level of trust between the different banks has reached a level where the distinction between ""handing someone a bag of cash"" and using one of these ""instant"" transfer services is now so small that we might as well say these transactions truly are instant.

But it relies on banks being in a *consortium* to work. It relies on centralisation. And even if the NPCI is ""not for profit"", its members are *banks*...";1;1;False;;dq23sfa;"""The rich don't need Bitcoin. The poor do. I already can transfer millions instantly.

"**National Payments Corporation of India**

National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI, Hindi: भारतीय राष्ट्रीय भुगतान निगम) is the umbrella organisation for all retail payment systems in India, which aims to allow all Indian citizens to have unrestricted access to e-payment services.

Founded in 2008, NPCI is a not-for-profit organisation registered under section 8 of the Companies Act 2013. The organisation is owned by a consortium of major banks, and has been promoted by the country’s central bank, the Reserve Bank of India. Its recent work of developing Unified Payments Interface aims to move India to a cashless society with only digital transactions.

"**Triple modular redundancy**

In computing, triple modular redundancy, sometimes called triple-mode redundancy, (TMR) is a fault-tolerant form of N-modular redundancy, in which three systems perform a process and that result is processed by a majority-voting system to produce a single output. If any one of the three systems fails, the other two systems can correct and mask the fault.

The TMR concept can be applied to many forms of redundancy, such as software redundancy in the form of N-version programming, and is commonly found in fault-tolerant computer systems.

Some ECC memory uses triple modular redundancy hardware (rather than the more common Hamming code), because triple modular redundancy hardware is faster than Hamming error correction software.

"IMPS is 24/7 but only because the other systems exist. 

Do you see what I'm getting at? That ""fast"" transfers bank-to-bank are essentially an *illusion*. Sure, you the customer get access to the money right away, but really you are spending money your bank has ""borrowed"" (or ""leant you"") on the expectation that the other bank will honour the transaction when the settlement occurs.

I will mea culpa on the fact that some of these system do settle more often than once per day. But, as far as I cant tell, it's still slower than even BTC (on the days BTC has not had 40% of its hashrate go to another coin).

There are two arguments against crypto generally that annoy me:

1. That VISA is much faster. Of course it is, it is a layer-on-a-layer.

2. That ""MY bank does free instant transfers"". No, it doesn't, not really. 

Because of the way crypto is designed, the transactions don't happen until they *really* happen. You are never going to find yourself in a situation where a single party says ""yeah... that 'instant' service... we're not doing that anymore because it's not profitable enough.""

The hated Core isn't deliberately *slowing down* transactions. At worst they are refusing to act quickly to speed them up.

Transaction times and costs will fluctuate according to real market forces. Unless we, in our rush to speed up and further cheapen txs, allow semi-centralisation.

The priority should NOT be ""faster cheaper transactions TODAY"". It should be ""ensure decentralisation and trustlessness is maintained at maximal possible values, at all times.""";1;1;False;;dq1dz8d;"""The rich don't need Bitcoin. The poor do.

"Ask 95% miner upgrade to Segwit version. Congestion n fee will drop:

What are the benefits of SegWit?

The most obvious benefit is a slight capacity increase. The elimination of unwanted transaction malleability is an important one. This was more of a nuisance bug as opposed to a critical bug. Other benefits include:

Weighting data based on how it affects node performanceSignature covers valueLinear scaling of sighash operationsIncreased security for multisigMore efficient almost-full-node securityScript versioningHow does it get implemented?

The way it gets “activated” is interesting. It requires 95% of miners to signal support for SegWit and for full nodes to upgrade to the latest version to include SegWit which is v0.13.1

The segwit soft fork has been designed to allow individuals in both groups to voluntarily decide whether or not they want to adopt segwit

For miners, there is a 1 year window starting from 15 November 2016 where miners can place a bit value of 1 in the blockheader version bits field.

The amount of support is constantly measured but will only activate if 95% of support is measured in a ~2 week period called the 2,016-block retarget period.

What is the current status?

There is a neat site called http://www.segwit.cowhere you can monitor the status. Currently there is about a 25% uptake since 15 November.

Summary

SegWit is a neat invention that the bitcoin core community put a lot of effort in because it provides positive fundamental changes to the bitcoin platform. It takes non-critical data out of the transaction to reduce the size (increasing throughput) along with other benefits.

"I think sovereignty needs to be defined. You can imagine a coin where you have what seems to be full sovereignty, yet the wires are been pulled by big players. In this regard, remember that even current fiat money seems to present some sort of sovereignty, yet it is being controlled by the state. Therefore, it lacks what bitcoiners would want to see in a decentralized coin. 

What I mean to say by this is quite simple: low fees does not translate to sovereignty by definition. It is actually just a property of the coin. 

So you might argue that the most sovereignty-giving coin is the one where control is dispersed by as many actors as possible - to a level where no single entity can change fundamental properties of this coin. By fundamental properties you would not consider fees to be one of these fundamental properties. This is an important distinction! 

For some, and I fully understand why, it may seem that high fees means your sovereignty is being compromised. But I believe this is not the case. Sovereignty means that no part in the system can take away control (in any way) if your ownership. This is the fundamental property of the coin you would desire the most. 

Think about it in an historical perspective. People were most vulnerable when they lack the ability to hold onto their ownership. States used to defragment people's ownership in order to disenfranchise that group. 

One can illustrate this differentiation between fees and ownership in ownership of a house. Any change in ownership to the house is cumbersome and expensive - requires the collaboration of multiple entities and professionals (licensed by the state). This is because home ownership is one of the most important assets a person can own - and therefore any damage to this ownership erodes a person's ability to remain sovereign against outside forces. 

I think at the heart of the issue, then, is the question of which property of the coin is fundamental to ownership. True ownership - not fake one. Not masked ownership. 

It is my humble opinion that fees (meant to accommodate the transfer of ownership) are not a fundamental property of ownership.

"The transfer isn't really free. The bank pays a LOT of money to make a large transfer at the end of the day. It is an example of the most likely solution to crypto's scaling - a secondary layer.

With a bank, when you receive an ""instant free transfer"" from another account, then both banks (the sender and your bank) trust each other to ""settle"" that account at the end of the day.

They let you spend that money from your account, even though *the real money* has not yet moved from the payer to the payee.

Now I don't know every bank in India, maybe there are some banks that settle instantly, but the point is that you are relying on these banks to move your money around and they profit from this. They can change this deal at any time - maybe the day you finally need to move some big money, they introduce a 2% fee. You can't know! You have to trust them! *You have to trust banks!!*

And wtf are you talking about they are sending from the Philippines to their family abroad? That doesn't happen much. It's the rich person abroad making way more the $100 sending money to their family in PH which can be done for a very low cost and high speed.

"> It can be $40... to send remittance... when they earn $100 a month

My issue with this whole debate is not the right or wrong of it, it's the constant exaggeration.

Even at the height of the first BCH pump, when the BTC mempool was absolutely jammed, the largest fee I had to pay was $18. 

Is $18 too much for poor people? Probably yes it is. Should something be done about this? Yes of course it should.

But exaggerating constantly and claiming fees are twice as high as they really are, just makes people dismiss your argument. Yes, you *can* absolutely send a tx with a $40  fee if you're mad enough and you demand your tx to be included in the next block. But why would a poor person need that transfer to be so fast? Why wouldn't they be happy to wait a day or two?

Because, also during that mempool ""crisis"" the other day, I also accidentally sent a tx with a ridiculously low fee of a little over a dollar. I sent that tx on a Saturday afternoon, and it was confirmed into my wallet by Monday morning.

That's slow for Bitcoin, but it's still faster than any bank in my country. Any tx sent via a bank on a Saturday would not clear until the following Tuesday.

There's an argument to be made about transaction costs and speed, but come on. Let's at least be honest about it.";0;3;False;;dq0x7pq;"""The rich don't need Bitcoin. The poor do.

"I really like this sentiment, but as a rich person with a bank account and credit cards, tech education, easy access to the internet etc, it has been quite difficult for me to procure BCH.

 I have had to teach myself a lot of stuff about how crypto works, and devote time to it and wait for transfers. Right now to buy it i have to go to a place online where I can buy a different crypto and exchange it for BCH. I don't even want to think about what it will take to enchange it for goods.

"Ok. A warning before reading my post. Crypto investment is always risky. Its a high risk, high reward type of investment. There is a small chance you will double or even triple your investment if you buy it right and there is a major chance that you will completely lose your money. 

So if you have a  long term view, then I recommend you diversify your investment in BTC, BCH, LSK, VTC, LTC, and some of those top 20 coins based on market value. 

Now, the important thing here is to get the very best rate for each of these coins. And have the will power to hold the currency when it is at a loss. 

Buy BTC for 50% of your total money. 25% of your investment on BCH and the rest on other coins. 

Now set aside half of your BTC budget and buy it at current market rates. And then set a buy order for BTC at  [Current BTC rate -10%] And again, set another BTC buy order for [current BTC rate-20%]

Keep in mind, crypto markets are extremely volatile so have a minimum of a month long view before doing a stop loss order. for example, I lost 70% of my investment for 10 days but it then rebounded back to 165% profit. I sold it during that time, but if I kept that for a few more days, it might be 250% profit. 

Get a trading basics book and learn how to read candlelight charts.

If you keep your long game as a main focus, you will end up profiting in the end. There are way too many noobs looking for get rick quick type investments so don't bother trying to compete with them.  

Also remember, this advice only applies to crypto currencies that has high volume in trading. Cryptocurrencies with less than $5 million volume are even more risky. In those investments, you lose a huge % of your money or make a huge profit occasionally, so its best to keep these investments to around $100 or something.

"Correct. Also, bitcoin is neutral. The tech in no way is evil.

It could be argued that letting fees go up as they have is forgetting about those who used it for small values. In some places, bitcoin was superior to their local currency since their local currency was losing purchasing power quickly.

However, as fees increase that superiority is reduced. In fact it could be that dealing with low value bitcoin transactions is less economical than holding onto a currency that is losing 50% value in a year.

We know how to batch transactions and be as efficient as possible, as we have been doing this for almost four years now. The bulk of Rebit's volume is from the south korean corridor, where our customers don't even know they are using Bitcoin. Their receivers also don't know anything about Bitcoin, yet they save money on fees by using our service compared to Western Union or banks. 

Our transaction volumes are at an all-time high across the SCI platform. Bitcoin sales on Buybitcoin.ph are through the roof. That being said, we are working on supporting BCash for our Bitbit.ph wallet users who are holding BTC. You can use BCH on Rebit right now, but through Shapeshift. As much as I personally disagree with Bcash, our business is agnostic to the tech and will support whatever has demand.

"Again the point is ignored - fees are high, that is objectively true. But it does not cost $40 to send $100. It has never been that expensive*. And the longest I've had to wait for a transaction was 36 hours, in the middle of a giant fooferaw with BCH and ""stolen hash rate"" and other bullshit.

The last TX I did, even though Coinbase warned me of ""high fees and long transaction times"" cost $1.27 and took 8 minutes.

Is that too slow/expensive for day to day commerce? Yes. Does the ability for me to extract over $500 worth of Bitcoin from Coinbase into my own wallet where I now control it, worth $1.27 and eight minutes? 

I think it is.

"No my post is saying, if you want to make a point about high fees, which are high there is no debate about that, then you must be *honest* and give *actual* costs.

Not ""if things keep going the way they are..."" or ""it is possible that a situation could exist where..."".

It is not currently necessary to pay $40 to transact $100 worth of Bitcoin. That is *not true*.

You must explain your point about the cost of transactions, and you must listen to the opposing point which is that, in the vast majority of cases, transacting moderate to large sums of money, especially internationally, using Bitcoin, is much cheaper than almost any other method.

Yes, Bitcoin Cash is cheaper again - at the moment. But questions remain around the nature of the solution and around the decentralisation of BCH. You can't just angrily say that Core has betrayed the blah blah censorship etc. Reddit is not the world. 

To suggest that the world's most highly valued cryptocurrency should be *immediately destroyed* because a solution to high fees has not been implemented on a schedule that suits you, is... well, it's grotesque is what it is (I am not saying YOU the person who posted above me thinks this, but many do). 

Both systems should be considered and should find their appropriate uses. They should not be ""at war"". There's no need for it.

Something that people who cite ""VISA"" or ""muh bank transfers"" must accept that the ""free and instant"" bank transfers that their bank may offer are not really free or instant and you must rely on your bank AND the receiving bank to honour the transfer. 

Right now, the banks do honour transfers. But you are reliant on a third party.

As for VISA, it is a layer on top of a layer, and you should talk to merchants about how much VISA benefits their business. Some will say enormously, some will grit their teeth. Some will fold their arms and say ""CASH ONLY.""

Nothing real in the world can happen for free. The people operating the Bitcoin (and any crypto) network cannot be expected to work for free, and the block reward is not enough.

The question is to develop a system that, as many say, can scale to billions of people and remain cheap, but which does not make us reliant on a small group of hardware operators.

Whether you support BCH or BTC or are objective, you must see that it is UNACCEPTABLE that the question of ""will hash power go to X or to Y"" even exists.

The system should be built in such a way that no group can affect it to any significant or meaningful degree.";1;0;False;;dq18aw8;"""The rich don't need Bitcoin. The poor do.

">The issue with the bucket analogy is that inflation isn't ""leaking"" any value its just diluting it.

The holder of an inflationary money has less value over time so I think the ""leaking"" analogy works. But it's true that the value that leaks away goes somewhere. So maybe we could imagine that the floor that everyone is walking on is sloped toward a central drain which feeds the leaked water to another bucket (this bucket being owned by the entity that has a monopoly on making the leaky buckets).

"The issue with the bucket analogy is that inflation isn't ""leaking"" any value its just diluting it. 

Deflation isn't keeping any more value in the bucket, its just concentrating it, like evaporating a solution. 

Here's where the analogy breaks down. The value of currency comes from facilitating trade. People don't give a shit if their bucket solution becomes more concentrated, but people do care if their money keeps getting more valuable because they stop spending it as much.

A deflationary currency discourages trade, but an inflationary currency doesn't discourage investment, it only discourages trying to store value in money.

">The holder of an inflationary money has less value over time so I think the ""leaking"" analogy works

Only if you assume centralized inflation (i.e. central banks/miners end up with all the new currency).

You can have inflation of the supply without moving around relative value. For example like with a stock split. If everyones shares are split in two, everyone still owns the same amount of value its just diluted into a larger number of shares.

Now it happens that you might want centralized inflation to work as an incentive system for miners/banks, but inflation as a raw concept does not require it.

The way bitcoins are produced actually does cause relative shifts in value (i.e. its concentrated in the hands of the miners, which i think is a great mistake because it creates an incentive for miners to increase the price of bitcoin rather than to try and maximize the number of transactions), although the supply is so limited that no one really minds since its still deflating overall.

>Consider the following: https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6yui3r/bitcoin_is_deflationary_in_nature_and_will_fail/dmqlcgo/

This has the same problem as every other pro-deflation argument I've seen (aside from ignoring the real world evidence that monetary deflation is terrible for economies, and the very immediate evidence that deflation is killing bitcoins use as currency), which is that it assumes there's only a binary choice between having an inflationary currency and a deflationary currency.

The idea that people have to consume so they'll still spend deflationary currency rather than save it only works if that's the only currency you have access to. If you have access to both deflationary and inflationary currency you never have any incentive to spend deflationary currency over the inflationary one. It's classic ""bad"" money pushing out good.

This is why we don't have any deflationary currencies anymore. It's why the entire world got off the gold standard. In the presence of a functional, low-inflation currency, deflationary currencies inevitably become assets or worthless, depending on whether it has any value when its not a currency.

All the pro-deflationist arguments still apply to gold but gold will never be a currency again because no one wants to spend it when you can spend other things that don't increase in value. Currency doesn't need to be a store of value. It only needs to facilitate trade, and mild inflation is far better at facilitating trade than mild deflation.";1;1;False;suninabox;dq1qdyp;When I joined Bitcoin people were giving *discounts* for using bitcoin for purchases because the fees were less than credit card processors.

I've heard this a lot but I've not yet seen a convincing argument why a functional cryptocurrency would need a settlement layer.

Seriously dude, the kool-aid.  You've got to stop.

You act as if it is surprising to encounter shady people in the Bitcoin world.  Dude, I've got some news for you and you aren't going to like it.  A shitload of shady people are and have always been attracted to Bitcoin.

You should read up on the censorship that has destroyed /r/Bitcoin, and the shady dishonest ""vulnerability sharing policy"" of Core, as well as their own shady histories such as writing bots to vandalize wikipedia pages and surreptitiously adding blacklists to Bitcoin Core clients in linux repositories.

> These are the people attacking bitcoin
