"Hi, so here are my quick answers:
1) We currently act as intermediary, but we don't censor messages like Airbnb does. So people are free to book outside of the platform if they chose to do so. Our long-term vision is to allow for pure P2P exchange through a smart contract, which connects peer reviews with payment (more updates on that to follow). Since Airbnb is taking up to 20% in fees, they have a monetization model, that's totally different from our vision, thus we don't see crypto payments as the main differentiating factor really
2) We don't offer any insurance (Airbnd didn't for the first 25m booking). We have a partnership with slice.is, through which our US and Canadian hosts can get a $2m insurance on a night-by-night basis (costs 5-10$ per night in my experience).
3 We do keep it from booking till payout, so the hosts are exposed to some crypto fluctuations for that period.

">We don't offer any insurance (Airbnd didn't for the first 25m booking). We have a partnership with slice.is, through which our US and Canadian hosts can get a $2m insurance on a night-by-night basis (costs 5-10$ per night in my experience). 

I hope to test your services soon, for tax reason I cannot spend my BCH until they are more than a year old.

So I still have to wait few months,

I hope you get insurance in all country, I think it is important.

"> 1) We currently act as intermediary, but we don't censor messages like Airbnb does. So people are free to book outside of the platform if they chose to do so. Our long-term vision is to allow for pure P2P exchange through a smart contract, which connects peer reviews with payment (more updates on that to follow). Since Airbnb is taking up to 20% in fees, they have a monetization model, that's totally different from our vision, thus we don't see crypto payments as the main differentiating factor

"I have 1 problem,

your prices are the double from FIAT.

For Pattaya, Thailand, for the same condo, same period.

Price on your website is, for 1 night  : 0.0093 BTC, for Coinbase, take 6.400, makes 64 euro per night.

When  I book with my Airbnb account, and pay in Euro, I pay 23 euro per night.

When I pay with BCH, it's 64 Euro, when I pay in Euro, it,s 23 Euro, But I believe you will find people who 50% more because they are BCH community

"Nice project, I have couple questions:

1) What happens with your project if AirBnB include Crypto payments?

2) Do you offer some guest/host protection in case of damage/problems?

3) Do you keep all crypto from time of booking until time of stay? What if there is big oscillation of price and one party simply decide that it longer makes no sense move forward with booking (e.g. you pay for stay BCH 100$ and as booking time arrives that same crypto is worth 250$. It makes more sense for you to cancel booking and find another one for 100$. Same goes for host if price drops)
