Ah okay yeah just checked and I could do that! Also any faster ways to get more USD into Coinbase/GDAX? I currently have a $15k bank limit but it takes 7 goddamn days to send (according to their estimation). My instant buys have a $500 daily limit (to which suddenly became $300 today while I was checking prices earlier??). I want to be able to put like $1k-$2k that doesn't take years to get on there and add up with fees.;1;1;False;DarkZyth;drjoimk;Buy, sell, send and receive Bitcoin Cash on Coinbase;7kxfor;https://blog.coinbase.com/buy-sell-send-and-receive-bitcoin-cash-on-coinbase-65f1b2c7214b
The price before coinbase was 3 when it hit coinbase it was just that but read the gdax status updates from yesterday. Trading enabled, than with in 25 mins it goes into post only mode and from there within an HR the price surge's due to that being the only amount available for you to buy so it 9-9,500 coinbase sees this goes oh shit shut it down. Price drops significantly no of this pictured on the graphs today. Here's the status updates https://status.gdax.com. Walks like a duck sounds like a duck. Shaddy.....

"Sorry, but calling everything ""weasel words"" doesn't refute it or give evidence.

1.  Transactions could be less than a buck if the blocks weren't full.  Blockstream wants full blocks, they've said so, they say that this is a money maker and hamstrings miners.  Satoshi said that miners were a valuable part of the ecosystem - Blockstream vilifies them.

2.  Typical cop out.  ""Average"" fees now are $42.  They could be less than a buck.  

3.  ""eventually large blocks""  I call huge BS because they could have 8mb blocks now without any loss of decentralization.

4.  Dubious?  18 months, right? ;-)

5.  It doesn't work along bitcoin, it, in many ways replaces it.

6.  Absolutely not false. 

7.  Weasel words to make people think LN is a creation of banks.  Uh, well, it is.

8.  yet to be seen or proven - its a pie in the sky fantasy that is used to cripple Bitcoin

9.  The whole part about arguing that LN does this or that is disingenous as it doesn't do anything yet and might never.  It should say, ""First of all, this assclown meant entrusted TO the LN, but w/e. We hope that, if it works, in the future, maybe 18 months away, our fingers are crossed, lightning nodes in the lightning network might not need to be trusted.

its really just a theory and arguing it like its a real thing is fraud.  Strangling BTC and dangling this ""theory"" as salvation is a huge con.

10.  Weaslly is selling something that doesn't exist.  People who do this are con artists.

11.  ""since the lightning network itself will produce scaling that **should** greatly reduce on-chain fees""

Well, they finally got one part right.

12.  Again, this guy is arguing that his theory is right.  Get back to us with a transaction confirmation, don't tell us about how great your fantasy product is.

13.  Those who aren't blockstream employees get grants and financial support in other ways.  If Blockstreams parent companies bribe these core nerds like they do the Clintons then I'm sure everything is on the up and up /s.

14. Whoever wrote this knows very little about blockstream, they are selling all sorts of off chain solutions to make money.  This is called rent.  Bitcoin was designed to escape rent payments to banks.

15.  Even an r/bitcoin mod has admitted that blockstream wants to squeeze miner profits in order to extract more rent from off chain solutions.  Posting that blog post to r/bitcoin is what got me banned there.  And so, here we are, here, debating, going toe to toe - something we can't do at r/bitcoin because I've been banned and anyone that takes an anti-blockstream position will be banned.  What does that tell you?  Blockstream is owned by banks, r/bitcoin is the biggest forum for bitcoin in the world and if you go against blcokstream you'll get banned.  That is hostile censorship from for-profit companies.

16.  LOL - yeah, blockstream will just build the toll booth, the federal reserve bankers who own it will collect the rent.

17.  As blockstream has said, you'll pay your fees to LN hubs and not to miners.  The miners will only get paid if you transmit a channel.  Show me where, in the whitepaper Satoshi said to undercut the miners?  He explained that the miners keep the system honest - because they make more money by being honest than by breaking the system down.  What this whole post is, it is an explanation of how an argument that is contrary to the white paper is superior to the logic of the white paper.  That makes BTC an alt coin.

18.  If I transmit a BTC transaction, once it hits a miner node, it is done.  Who says who is going to control the LN hubs?  Government doesn't like you?  Closes your channel.  Didn't pay your taxes, your  channel gets blocked.  The hubs that run channels will be regulated like banks.

19.  Yup, you stated it but don't prove it.  And even if you can show ""proof"" for it, it is theoretical proof for your fantasy LN product.

20.  More and more people are shut out of BTC every day - the fees will continue to rise and shut out even more.  What is weasly is calling everything weasly.

21.  ""taking bitcoin's name as bitcoin cash, and bitcoin's perceived value via forced adoption by a hard fork, forcing all bitcoin users to have bcash, whether they wanted to or not.""

Oh, this is rich.  They argue that the white paper is wrong and then complain that the coin that follows the white paper has stolen their name.  Its not their name, Bitcoin is not owned by BTC nor its holders.  Bitcoin cash is every much Bitcoin (and more) than BTC.  And then ""whether they wanted it or not?""  If I mail everyone in the US a $5 bill, they can spend it, trade if for Pesos, burn it, or give it away.  No one forced them to take it and put it in their checking account.  This is really a foolish argument.

22.  Yes, some changes to the programming but it is still a ""peer to peer electronic cash"" and retains all its signatures.  Both of these are descriptions - in the white paper - of Bitcoin.  Segwit is neither of these and is an alt coin sure as the sun rises.

23.  Transactions are much, much faster.  My last BCH transactions had 16 confirms before BTC had one.  And, a BCH transfer is good as soon as you send it.  It is beyond reproach with one confirm.  BTC?  You had better have 6.

Please, show me, where in the white paper do you see Replace by Fee?  The whole point of Bitcoin was that there were no ""do overs.""  Why in the world was RBF instituted?

What is decentraliztion and how does bitcoin get it



Decentralization is one of Bitcoin's main selling points. But what does it actually mean? Skip to the end for the tl;dr

**What is centralization**    
As we all know from reading everything Satoshi wrote about his design for Bitcoin from satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org, Bitcoin was finalized and born in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. In this event many normal people lost money while banking executives made more and more. 

**Where does centralization come from**       
These banks, much like the bank you probably use today, are centralized. That is, they alone control everything that happens. There is one database which has everyone's funds, if they decide you are a terrorist or something they can stop you from access your money. They can stop you from making transactions. Even if you have done nothing wrong they can stop payment on your transactions without your consent, lock you out of your funds, and monitor everything you do. 


**What  is decentralization**       
By splitting up the 'power' that a bank has we decentralize it. There is no longer any one single entity that can control txs and funds. This way no one is 'in charge' and no one can give themselves bonuses while other people lose money. This decentralization is a founding point of Bitcoin.

**Where does decentralization come from**       
Instead of one company controlling the database of funds like in the centralized model, in Bitcoin's decentralized model there are many people who can all contribute to the database and transaction processing without any one entity having full control. In Bitcoin and other POW based cryptocurrencies this decentralization is achieved by having a number of *mining nodes* who are not affiliated. As long as no group of miners controls more than 51% of the hashpower, bitcoin remains decentralized.

---


**So only mining nodes contribute to decentralization, then what about non-mining nodes**      
Non-mining nodes, full nodes, relay nodes, or storage nodes are often misunderstood to be part of decentralization. This can be easily cleared up by understanding the above information and then understanding that a non-mining node has no *power* if the majority of hashpower were to do something they didn't like. 

**I thought everyone was supposed to run a full node**      
This is another common misunderstanding, in the very beginning Satoshi did intend for everyone to run a node with 4 functions. He is very clear when he explains how this is not the way for the system to function in the future. The plan of bitcoin is that everyone can make trustless peer-to-peer transactions on a decentralized system. Not that everyone would run a home server with the whole blockchain. The business and bitcoin companies that need to have personal and instant validation of their tx can run a full nodes. Random sampling is a tried and trusted method, those unable to host their own relay node would be easily able to verify their transactions with overwhelming mathematically certainty.

**So who wants to run a full node then**     
Anyone who wants to can, it's like the Olympics, 'anyone can compete but few feel the need to'. There is no reason the network should be ground to a halt and made useless so people who can't afford to make a transaction would be able to run a full node on a 20 year old computer over a dial up connection. Bitcoin was meant to scale with technology, not become left behind. 


**What are the 4 functions that all early nodes did**       
When you read the design of Bitcoin which we all invested into, the design on which so much was built, the one at nakamotoinstitute.org, you see Satoshi mention the word 'node' many times. What we today call a full node or non-mining node usually fulfills one of those functions, that of storing the database. Finding other peers for connecting to is done by full nodes and pool operators. Sending and receiving bitcoin, aka a wallet, was also a function every node had. Finally generating coins by putting new transactions into the blockchain was the 4th thing all nodes used to do. Today these 4 actions are largely compartmentalized, as they should be in any good computer science project.

This is Bitcoin, some people are unhappy with the way Bitcoin was designed, well I suppose Bitcoin is simply not for those people and they should maybe find something else to do.


I hope you've all learned something today about how Bitcoin is decentralized, what is means, and how we got there.

tl;dr Banks control all txs and accounts with one database and are centralized, Bitcoin has many miners who perform this actions to make it decentralized. Non-mining nodes don't contribute to decentralization.

Every full node verifies that the data that a miner actually writes into a block is correct. If enough full nodes take issue in that, then the miner loses out on his reward.

That is to prevent miners from just writing empty/bogus stuff into the blockchain as that would be quicker to do and they could return to the PoW duties quicker to mine even more gold.

"I don't think that is accurate, but as I said I have not read up on it. Can you point me to an external source?

I know that the miners check each other when they are hashing and until one earns a new block. But after they earn a right, they still have to fill up the next block with transactions that are valid with respect to prior transactions in the ledger.

What is being checked after that is not a computing puzzle. It's an ""add everything together and see if the sum is zero"" kind of puzzle.

&nbsp;

**Here is the important part**:

In the end, I as a full node have to decide which miner's blockchain I want to even continue to use. There are always multiple blockchains, and the quickest one finished (as long as it is correct) will be downloaded on my part.

If not enough people download *that* miner's blockchain (historically because another was quicker, but **theoretically** because 1 and 1 don't add up), then we have a consensus against his new block.

As long as enough full nodes are running, a bogus miner's new block can never enter ""the blockchain"".

I really disagree with your interpretation. This quote, straight from the whitepaper in the SPV section, seem to contradict you:

> Businesses that receive frequent payments will probably still want to
run their own nodes for more independent security and quicker verification.

It does not state that in the long term, almost everyone will have to run SPV clients and trust a limited set of nodes.

Being able to run a full node shouldn't be a privilege only available to miners with huge computer farms, it's an integral part of Bitcoin and a feature described in the whitepaper.

For now it's not a problem either with BCH or BTC, but the choices we are going to make along the way regarding blocksize (among other factors) will affect this. There are businesses of all sizes and everyone should be able to participate with the same level of security, without having to completely rely on third parties.

But I suppose we just don't agree on this and that's why I reacted when you've promoted the idea that we'd be just fine without non-mining full nodes on the network and that everyone could just use SPV clients relying/trusting mining full nodes.

Finally, even if as you suggest it only concerns the *end game*, when ""crypto already won"", we will still have to maintain a secure network at this point... so these choices cannot be taken lightly.";0;0;False;joeknowswhoiam;drky78f;You can now store a year's worth of continuously full 8MB blocks for the cost of a single BTC transaction;7l9468;https://m.newegg.com/products/9SIA5AD4TR8861

"> You can get a cheap VPS hosted wherever you want, for less than your internet bill.

I know a lot about that. As I orchestrate tens of them for a living right now. Dedicated ones are basically free... except for storage. I currently pay at least 5 bucks per terrabyte a month (Hetzner comes to mind for cheapest storage tbh). With a more ""simple"" solution, we are at 10 bucks per terrabyte a month.

so that would be 60-120 bucks per year for a 1 TB solution.

Storage is what I pay for. With a service provider like Hetzner, I get computing and energy effectively for free.

While that number could go down, it has not in the past 3 or so years. In fact, WD Reds went up in price for quite some time (but other cheap options entered the market).

I am saying as someone that pays 4 digits for server infrastructure per year for *personal* reasons, I simply wouldn't scale that up unless I have to.

I think only people that consistently make money off of crypto currencies could afford to run a full node at this point. Running a full node turns into an *investment* basically. I could invest that money into a crypto, instead. If I hold IOTA, I have to run a full node. There is that as well.

> An aside, I didn't really know that about Germany. I assumed europe == fast internet. TIL

God no. When we moved, we had to go from just checking out places to talk ot the ISPs first to see if they are even an option. Living space / bandwidth etc. are currently huge problems in Germany (albeit first world problems but problems indeed).

Scandinavia and Romania have great internet. Netherlands is pretty decent too. The rest is shit (given some exceptions, Estonia or a country close to it has universal free access to broadband internet).

So if I apply your advice and nobody aside from mindes runs full nodes, they are the only ones left on the network with a complete copy of the blockchain.

The mining incentive is upheld by the market value of the coins being mined. Kicking some non mining nodes off the network might affect the price, or it might not, as there are a huge set of variables that affect price.

"You're right, verifying a block is much easier computationally than mining a new block. Full nodes (mining and non-mining) perform the act of verifying and forwarding new transactions (stored in the mempool) and new blocks.  Any transactions or blocks that are found to be invalid are not accepted by the node and never transmited through the system.  Only blocks and transactions accepted by a majority of the network are added to the blockchain through consensus.

I have an uncapped 100mbps (megabits) connection and pay only $50/month, which works out to about about 8-10 Mb/s (megabytes) in the real world, and if only 2Mb/s were dedicated to mining full time I could probably handle 1Gb blocks today (assuming 10 minute block time) running a full node at home, but I'd rather have something like 32Mb blocks and a 20 second block time.

However, is no where near as severe as some would have you believe. You can always mine empty blocks on just the block headers, but you need to keep the time low enough that most blocks are ~~full~~ utilized for transactions. For example: If half are empty, you've effectively cut capacity in half.

"As the founder said (pay attention to the second bit in bold):

""Long before the network gets anywhere near as large as that, it would be safe 
for users to use Simplified Payment Verification (section 8) to check for 
double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or 
about 12KB per day.  **Only people trying to create new coins would need to run 
network nodes.  At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the 
network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to 
specialists with server farms of specialized hardware.  A server farm would 
only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with 
that one node.**

""The bandwidth might not be as prohibitive as you think.  A typical transaction 
would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact).  Each transaction has to be 
broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction.  Visa processed 37 billion 
transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day.  
That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or 
2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices.

**""If the network were to get that big, it would take several years, and by then, 
sending 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a big deal.""**

"I think you are correct, but the real key is to realize there was never any notion that regular people would run non-mining full clients in any of Satoshi's writings or designs, and that this was entirely an idea added later by people who don't understand the system. 

If you understand how SPV works (Section 8 of the [whitepaper](https://bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf); crucially, read ""overpowered by an attacker"" as ""a *minority* hashpower attacker finds a few blocks in a row by luck,"" pursuant to the rest of the whitepaper), you'll understand we already have working SPV (i.e., Electron Cash) and thus you can *trustlessly* verify all your own transactions merely by waiting for a couple of additional confirmations so that any minority hashpower attacker's luck runs out (bringing you back to equal footing with a ""full node"" in terms of trustlessness and security) 

People will claim you have to trust the miners when using SPV whereas with a ""full validating node"" you don't, but this is incorrect: in both cases you have to trust the mining *incentives*, and in neither case is there anything you can do if the majority of miners act counter to their incentives, as ""full validating nodes"" are defenseless against the easiest and most damaging attack (undoing validly confirmed transactions) as this doublespend attack uses *perfectly valid blocks.* 

Thus there is no additional trustlessness nor security offered by running a non-mining heavy client (a.k.a. ""full node"" / fake miner / dormant node / sockpuppet miner). The only exception is if you are a merchant and want to accept unconfirmed transactions as payment. In that case it does help (but only if blocks are never full of transactions with fees exceeding what you are telling your customers to pay at point of sale, meaning the blocksize is at least an order of magnitude above demand @ the fee rate your customers are paying).

EDIT: Likewise these non-miners offer no additional security nor decentralization to the Bitcoin network.

"That's really not a convincing argument to me. It all boils down to *having to buy one of those every year*. Then after 6 years, there are no slots left... so I need to replace them with bigger ones.

While I don't need redundancy, pooling 6 of those is probably not smart either without any redundancy or it will just break once a year.

What this boils down to is one assumption:

Will Moore's law continue to hold? Physically it cannot just keep holding truth in its simplest form, because transistor density approached its logistic limit and we are at the asymptotic end of the density growth.

There is a chance that the growth continues at a different pace. There is also a chance that Moore's law keeps withstanding this. We are moving to more cores and more GPUs. We are parallelizing storage.

I agree it's more likely that we will be able to keep scaling with blocksize in the future. 10 TB or 100 TB will *probably* not sound as scary 4 years down the line.

"The problem is that we need storage to outpace chain size if we want to maintain decentralized/fully distributed ledgers.

BCH is 16MB limit right now, but it is adjustable (correct me if I‚Äôm wrong).
Let‚Äôs humor the long term here - if BCH where to do as many transactions as Visa on an average day, the chain would grow at ~31 GB per day (i have the math in a spreadsheet if anybody is interested).

With that in mind, I think it is important to consider that on chain scaling probably isn‚Äôt indefinite. Other efficiency gains will probably need to come from somewhere.

Or, as an alternative, we could break up the blockchain into small bits and balance how many copies of each block exist. Like, i am willing to dedicate 20 GB of storage to the chain, so the network provides an applicable segment of the chain.

Also, I‚Äôd like to highlight the validity of the bandwidth posts. Storage is finite and precious, bandwidth is finite and precious, power is finite and precious. Efficiency is key. It seems like we have plenty of resources until we don‚Äôt (i.e. transaction volume on BTC).

TLDR - Don‚Äôt ignore storage. We don‚Äôt want to centralize nodes.

"> upload speed

Is an incredible point.

Most residential cable lines will give about 10Mbps upload speed (1.25MB/s), which means 8MB blocks upload to a single node in about 6.4 seconds. We'll round that up to 7 seconds.

Assuming 8 connections, that's 8 nodes * 7 seconds = 56 seconds to upload one 8MB block to all 8 nodes

In that scenario, nodes with that bandwidth are still relaying full 8MB blocks **much** quicker than new blocks are being added to the chain

32MB blocks would take a 10Mbps line roughly 4 minutes to upload to 8 nodes. Still 2x faster than blocks are found.

"I think you should read this that I wrote: Why the whitepaper is so imporant.


People who researched Bitcoin before investing probably meant to invest in what they researched. Changing the fundamental aspects of this investment without their permission or want is unethical. 

The Bitcoin whitepaper is the specification of Bitcoin, a high level overview that should persists as relevant for all of Bitcoin's life. That's what a whitepaper is. If someone wants a system with full blocks, high fees, forced middlemen(LN), or full nodes with power, then what they want is not Bitcoin.

Let us use this simple analogy as a thought experiment to see why people feel the way they do.

*Imagine*

You read about a new steakhouse with very tasty steaks.     
You go to there, read the menu, pick out the best steak and order it.

No Imagine they bring you scrambled eggs instead. No steak. You went to the steak house, you ordered a steak, you were expecting a steak, but they brought you something else.

You complain to the waiter who tells you the cooks are experts with food and they know better than you. The cooks decided scrambled eggs would be better for you without your input or consent. 

The waiter asks why you are upset? He says he doesn't understand.         
You wanted food, they brought you food, why are you upset? The cooks are smarter than you, they know what you want better than you, you should be grateful for their input says the waiter.


This is how most Bitcoin users feel, that what they wanted (bitcoin) is not what they have (legacy bitcoin).

"I made some rough calculations regarding blockchain growth estimates and download time.

This table assumes:

* Full blocks, always
* 2017 bandwidth at 40MBit/s ([source](http://www.speedtest.net/insights/blog/global-speed-2017/))
* Annual bandwidth increase of 20% (lower than 2017 of 30%)
* Doubling of the block size every 4 years
* ALWAYS full blocks

If the volume of transactions increases, then the fees don't need to go up in value for the total fee reward to increase.

Absolutely nothing.  Fee paying transactions are not spam....   transactions are only a problem when there's no room for more - which is why a full blocks are a bad choice (and was never part of the bitcoin design).    The economics and game theory with respect to increasing block size (continuously) are nowhere near the issue that many people have painted them to be .... and it's not like it won't increase gradually enough to cope with any issues that arise as we go.

"Kind of like you can't have a discussion here about how off-base Roger Ver is?

""I see inside trading as a non-crime"". That is okay in 0 circumstances. Even /r/btc should agree that they don't want to be swindled by insider trading.

I am not saying that yesterday was insider trading either. Neither was Roger. But he openly admitted that if ever there was insider trading on an exchange, he thinks it's OK and shouldn't be investigated because the exchanges are ""regulated enough already"".

Cmon. Put your head on straight. That is OK under 0 circumstances.

So is calling other people ""retarded"" in a public forum when you are being taken a role model by thousands of people.

The guy is offbase. Period. A full on high pressure salesman too with the way he reiterates over and over the same 3-5 value points and has nothing in depth to get at besides his surface points that demonstrate value.

It's really getting old. And Honestly...CEO of a website? That's fucking laughable. I have over 500 CEO jobs then if all it takes is owning a fucking website.

Ego issues, shrugs shoulders at corruption if it were to exist, malicious intent all around - the guy is just no good.

**BCH is a beautiful thing and he absolutely makes it seem like a childish scandal which it isn't and doesn't need to be to succeed.**

"What good is Bitcoin if it costs $30+ per transaction? When core devs talk disparagingly about ‚Äòcoffee on the blockchain‚Äô it makes me upset.

It wasn‚Äôt about how much money you had, it was about the cool things you could *do* with this magic internet money. Coffee and other small transactions on the blockchain are simple, effective ways of proving to people that *crypto has value and is worthwhile* as a global currency replacement. I moved to Bitcoin Cash because Bitcoin is no longer viable for that kind of thing, and now you‚Äôre acting like I and others are somehow attacking Bitcoin by using a coin that is much, much closer to the traditional goals of Bitcoin than core BTC is right now. How does the Lightning Network help me make small p2p transactions? It still hasn‚Äôt been explained to me why ‚Äòbig blocks = instant destruction of bitcoin ideals‚Äô.

"A common theme in your comments here is that you think you're getting all these services ""free"". You're not. Maybe the cost is worth it to you, in that case crypto is probably more hassle than it's worth, and that's ok.

Crypto was born in the minds of libertarians. Much of the value that people like myself derive from crypto is in the liberation from coercive governments and Jewish usury. Protect my assets from arseholes who will use the full force of the government to confiscate a percentage of my rightfully obtained property every year? I'll take that over a customer service phoneline. Isolate my economic activity from the Jewish-run central banks that maintain my people in a perpetual state of debt with financial market manipulation, and siphon away my family's property every moment of every day right under their noses via inflationary fiat currency? I'll take the responsibility of crypto over surrendering to that shit.

If you think your participation in fiat is free, stuff some cash under your mattress for a couple decades, or try to conduct a voluntary transaction with a person for something the government won't allow, or tell the tax man you're not interested in his services this year. Maybe crypto isn't for you, I'm not going to try to convince you. It's an incredible tool for securing liberty for people like me though.

">Satoshi never claimed to be a libertarian, nor Finney or Andresen or anyone else AFAIK, and the average 1st world citizen is definitely not

Perhaps not explicitly, but at the very least you would have to say that their vision for Bitcoin is inarguably aligned very strongly with libertarian principles. They may not have been 'Libertarians' but they were libertarians. 

As for the average 1st world citizen, I'm not quite sure what your point is. I would just say that the average person simply does what is in their own rational economic self interest. If that means voting for leftist policies that empower the government to take shit from other people to give to them, a lot of them will do it, often because they haven't or can't consider the moral issues with that. I think crypto undermines this scheme because it allows people another way to protect their assets and conceal their economic activity from the state and its looters. At the very least, it brings the moral issue of government coercion into the public consciousness any time the state seeks to intervene with taxation, regulation, prohibition of crypto. In short, crypto exposes the public to the virtues of libertarianism, it creates libertarians. 

>I would rather stuff it in an index fund so I can comfortably double it every 7 years

I think you missed my point. Some people would rather buy gold or Beanie Babies too, but why don't people want to store their fiat? 

Because they can't. Because every day its value will be siphoned away by the printing presses as the government creates more money out of thin air. That money under the mattress will be worth a fraction of its value in a couple decades. Many people have money in the bank or in stocks not because they want to, but because they *have to* to avoid having their life savings eroded away, powerless to do anything about it. 

>what are your thoughts on the blocksize debate?

Increase the blocksize. That's the design, it makes sense, and it's easy. If ever the block size limitation approaches a point where it creates centralisation pressure and/or exceeds the rate of technological advancement, then we've got a problem. We don't yet, not even close. 

A 1mb cap at the moment is like having a pixelated shitty banner on your company's website so most people can't even read your phone number, all because you want to keep it to 10kb. It's okay, use the high resolution 80kb one. The page load speed difference will be negligible, the site so much better for it, and people will be able to use your business again. Nobody is going to be unable to load your pages because of it. Don't make complex arrangements with 3rd party image hosts, don't reinvent the wheel trying to compress it by removing vital info from it. Just increase the size, it's fine. If the day comes where your banner is 50mb (and people are still on current day connection speeds) then you've got a problem, not now. I see literally no reason at all not to increase the size; the cost is negligible, while the gain is enormous.

I am generally extremely wary of 'solutions' that bastardise the protocol with poorly understood and very controversial changes, especially when, as evidenced by Segwit adoption (or lack thereof), the market doesn't actually want. It reeks of geeks with a Jesus complex trying to prolong their relevance.

Why can't I pay for security and home insurance then, without having my government threaten me with prison (or worse) if I don't work my arse off to fund wars I want no part in against people I have no beef with, or to then import millions of these hostile, incompatible people into my community and pay them not to participate. 

You might like a lot of the shit the government (inefficiently) provides with your tax dollars. So do I. Well guess what? You can still have that good stuff! You can choose to pay for it.

But there's a lot of stuff I don't like. A lot of it I think other providers could do much better and/or for a lower price. A lot of it I just really don't want because I consider it unconscionable or because it actively does me and my family harm. You're on very shaky moral ground if you're going to try to justify these things to me. ";2;0;False;BlacknOrangeZ;drjppk1;They say we are trying to Kill Bitcoin. No, we are not.

agreed. 

> Adoption on BTC has gone backwards.

thats funny. 

if you look at graphs and actual stats it seems to attest otherwise. [Unique addresses for the last year](https://blockchain.info/charts/n-unique-addresses?timespan=1year) have increased, so have [confirmed transactions per day](https://blockchain.info/charts/n-transactions?timespan=1year), and the rate of increase of [total number of transactions](https://blockchain.info/charts/n-transactions-total?timespan=1year_) has remained consistent, so i am not sure what you are basing your argument on. please enlighten me.

> Large blocks aren't just a stop-gap solution. 

Yes, i think they are. Its my informed opinion.

> They are the only real way to maintain a truly free decentralized p2p electronic cash.

Ok, believe as you like. I will not agree with you at all. 

If anything, on chain scaling will lead to the massive centralisation of nodes that you rail against- not the other way around. If you don't see that, i haven't the patience to convince you. 

You have the BCH chain. be happy with it, and its roadmap, and move on, leaving BTC behind.

"Often overlooked, high transaction fees can actually CAUSE centralisation as smaller/solo miners are priced out of withdrawing their mining rewards until they've accrued enough for it not to deplete their rewards. Many miners (especially smaller operations) run on a very narrow profit margin so delays in withdrawing coins to sell or re-invest bring a noticeable impact to their operation.

Let's say reasonably, a miner shouldn't lose more than 1% of their mining reward just by withdrawing the reward to their own wallets, here's some rough calculations;

Miner is running 1 x Antminer S9 that cost them $2000.
Miner's rewards are maybe $50 per day
Let's assume a transaciton fee of $25

If a miner wanted to withdraw their $50 reward daily, they would lose half due to the $25 fee.
Weekly withdrawals would result in a 7% loss, monthly still result in 1.7% loss
In this case, a withdrawal every 50 days would result in a more reasonable 1% loss.

But 50 days in the crypto world is a long time! This is not sustainable as a mining operation. Miners need to sell coins to cover costs or re-invest in to additional mining hardware and infrastructure.

So let's flip this around and calculate the additional amount of hardware required for reasonable returns, instead of time.

For a miner to withdraw their rewards daily with a 1% loss due to transaction fees, they'd require a minimum of $2500 rewards that are pending withdrawal.

Assuming $2000 of hardware returns $50 reward per day, THE MINER WOULD NEED 50 OF THESE (total cost of $100,000) for them to withdraw their daily earnings!

"Look, I'm not doing your homework for you.  Names in the field with actual Engineering or Science degrees have researched big blocks and they're totally feasible.  Peter Rizun and Andrew Stone are smart guys not to be trifled with.  It's been proven to work.  It can be done TOMORROW on current hardware and in the future hardware will only get better.

So I won't do your bidding, like a little coffee boy, and compile up research that it's the way to go.

There is also research that shows Lightning has several huge technical flaws.  Research by serious computer scientists.  It has a major routing problem, because every node needs to know the entire state of the network in order to route.  That's a huge hurdle.  It's the classic traveling salesman problem which doesn't have a simple solution.  There's no reason to think they will have solved this problem.

So the bottom line is Lightning will NOT be decentralized as a result.  It will be a hub and spoke model, with the hubs being huge huge points of wealth and power.  A mesh huge mesh network will be so chatty that it will probably collapse under its own weight.  

This doesn't even begin to touch the fact that there are little incentives to lock up funds in some 2nd layer network.  Perhaps incentives will arise.  I don't know.  Right now it looks like computer science masturbation to me, to put it bluntly.

And suppose Lightning really is this panacea of excellence.  So what?  8MB block Bitcoin Cash can easily adopt it.  It's not either/or.

What Core has done is crippled bitcoin TODAY for a promise of something that may or may not work TOMORROW.  It's stupid.

And.. The exact opposite of what we want for cryptos.

All the other stuff you said is either opinion, which is fine, or just a point of view  that fails to take into account important fundamentals.  Take for example your assertion that BTC is growing.  It is in some sense, but it is definitely losing ground in many important ways: Merchant adoption of bitcoin is in retrograde right now.  Noone is using it for commerce.  Its last remaining use case is a speculative asset and/or a store of value.  That's it.  Maybe that's enough.

RBF is still actually opt-in. The real reason BTC can't do even moderately secure 0-conf is that their blocks are too full.

"bcash and bitcoin cash are completely separate coins, like zcash and legacy bitcoin are not the same coin. 

What metric do *you* use to measure de/centralization?


---

Decentralization is one of Bitcoin's main selling points. But what does it actually mean? Skip to the end for the tl;dr

**What is centralization**    
As we all know from reading everything Satoshi wrote about his design for Bitcoin from satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org, Bitcoin was finalized and born in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. In this event many normal people lost money while banking executives made more and more. 

**Where does centralization come from**       
These banks, much like the bank you probably use today, are centralized. That is, they alone control everything that happens. There is one database which has everyone's funds, if they decide you are a terrorist or something they can stop you from access your money. They can stop you from making transactions. Even if you have done nothing wrong they can stop payment on your transactions without your consent, lock you out of your funds, and monitor everything you do. 


**What  is decentralization**       
By splitting up the 'power' that a bank has we decentralize it. There is no longer any one single entity that can control txs and funds. This way no one is 'in charge' and no one can give themselves bonuses while other people lose money. This decentralization is a founding point of Bitcoin.

**Where does decentralization come from**       
Instead of one company controlling the database of funds like in the centralized model, in Bitcoin's decentralized model there are many people who can all contribute to the database and transaction processing without any one entity having full control. In Bitcoin and other POW based cryptocurrencies this decentralization is achieved by having a number of *mining nodes* who are not affiliated. As long as no group of miners controls more than 51% of the hashpower, bitcoin remains decentralized.

---


**So only mining nodes contribute to decentralization, then what about non-mining nodes**      
Non-mining nodes, full nodes, relay nodes, or storage nodes are often misunderstood to be part of decentralization. This can be easily cleared up by understanding the above information and then understanding that a non-mining node has no *power* if the majority of hashpower were to do something they didn't like. 

**I thought everyone was supposed to run a full node**      
This is another common misunderstanding, in the very beginning Satoshi did intend for everyone to run a node with 4 functions. He is very clear when he explains how this is not the way for the system to function in the future. The plan of bitcoin is that everyone can make trustless peer-to-peer transactions on a decentralized system. Not that everyone would run a home server with the whole blockchain. The business and bitcoin companies that need to have personal and instant validation of their tx can run a full nodes. Random sampling is a tried and trusted method, those unable to host their own relay node would be easily able to verify their transactions with overwhelming mathematically certainty.

**So who wants to run a full node then**     
Anyone who wants to can, it's like the Olympics, 'anyone can compete but few feel the need to'. There is no reason the network should be ground to a halt and made useless so people who can't afford to make a transaction would be able to run a full node on a 20 year old computer over a dial up connection. Bitcoin was meant to scale with technology, not become left behind. 


**What are the 4 functions that all early nodes did**       
When you read the design of Bitcoin which we all invested into, the design on which so much was built, the one at nakamotoinstitute.org, you see Satoshi mention the word 'node' many times. What we today call a full node or non-mining node usually fulfills one of those functions, that of storing the database. Finding other peers for connecting to is done by full nodes and pool operators. Sending and receiving bitcoin, aka a wallet, was also a function every node had. Finally generating coins by putting new transactions into the blockchain was the 4th thing all nodes used to do. Today these 4 actions are largely compartmentalized, as they should be in any good computer science project.

This is Bitcoin, some people are unhappy with the way Bitcoin was designed, well I suppose Bitcoin is simply not for those people and they should maybe find something else to do.


I hope you've all learned something today about how Bitcoin is decentralized, what is means, and how we got there.

"What /r/Bitcoin needs to understand:

* There are no attacks on BTC.

* High fees are a problem at least eventually.

* LN might not work. Even if it does, blocksize will need to increase at some point and it may be impossible to get miners to switch without forcing their hand by profit incentive (ie, BCH overtaking BTC).


What /r/BTC needs to understand:

* Investors don't care about high fees because they aren't using Bitcoin.

* You can't by BCH on futures markets. We haven't seen what this means yet, but on paper its bad for the BCH vs BTC case.

* LN might work, and sooner than people think. If it does, BCH goes to BTG levels or lower - whatever those are.

If not, we develop clever engineering solutions to solving it.

Definitely blockspace on the order of 1GB will be needed regardless of what we do.

Perhaps a layer 2 can co-exist then with a large on-chain capacity.

But a hybrid solution can exist.  And right now all we need is on-chain capacity to take on the exponential level of adoption we need for this shit to get mainstream.

Adding LN to BCH would mean BCH admitting that big blocks don't work. Who would want to use LN if you could just send directly on the chain and not have to open and close channels? LN is the antithesis of everything BCH is supposed to be. On top of that, LN would be worse on BCH because it would have less hubs to send payments through (centralization) and less network adoption than bitcoin, so why would a business every want to use BCH's LN over BTC's LN?

"that paper is a closed door 18 node (real world) test, of 4-6 miners (real world?) of up to and including 1000 tx/s (real world?)

you think that is the equivalent of the world's commerce?

they even state, in the [actual presentation](https://scalingbitcoin.org/stanford2017/Day1/Stanford_2017.pptx.pdf) that to scale up to global adoption 50000 tx/s you would need 50 core computers, and 1.5Gbps internet speeds. They don't even go into memory and ram, and give a hunch about VISA levels - not world commerce levels.

"Literally 2 generations ago in my family the communists came and took everything they owned, in 1946, in Romania.  They weren't wealthy but they were categorized as burgeoise oppressors.

We already have that.  Its called a bank account.

Bitcoin was supposed to free us from banks.  Now, it has been co-opted by banks:

[Digital Currency Group](http://dcg.co/who-we-are/) owns (in part) and directs [Blockstream](http://dcg.co/portfolio/) (go to ""B"" and look 13 down). Guess who runs Digital Currency Group:
 
1. Glenn Hutchins: Former Advisor to President Clinton. Hutchins sits on the board of **The Federal Reserve Bank of New York**, where he was reelected as a Class B director for a three-year term ending December 31, 2018.
 
2. Barry Silbert: CEO of Digital Currency Group, (**funded by Mastercard**) who is also an Ex investment Banker at Houlihan Lokey. This is the guy who thought SW2x was a good idea.
 
3. Lawrence H. Summers: ""Board Advisor""
""**Chief Economist at the World Bank from 1991 to 1993**. In 1993, Summers was appointed **Undersecretary for International Affairs of the United States Department of the Treasury under the Clinton Administration**. In 1995, he was promoted to **Deputy Secretary of the Treasury** under his long-time political mentor Robert Rubin. In 1999, he succeeded Rubin as **Secretary of the Treasury**. While working for the Clinton administration Summers played a leading role in the American response to the 1994 economic crisis in Mexico, the 1997 Asian financial crisis, and the Russian financial crisis. He was also **influential in the American advised privatization of the economies of the post-Soviet states [a massive FUD campaign that caused Russian citizens to sell their shares in public companies - these shares were purchased by Oligarch bankers with ties to Western Banks and most Russian people had their national resources stolen from them]**, and in the **deregulation of the U.S financial system, including the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act**.""
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Summers
 
4. Blythe Masters: ""Former executive at JPMorgan Chase.[1] She is currently the CEO of Digital Asset Holdings,[2] a financial technology firm developing distributed ledger technology for wholesale financial services.[3] Masters is **widely credited as the creator of the credit default swap as a financial instrument**. She is also Chairman of the Governing Board of the Linux Foundation‚Äôs open source Hyperledger Project, member of the **International Advisory Board of Santander Group**, and **Advisory Board Member of the US Chamber of Digital Commerce**.""
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blythe_Masters
 
DCG is also an investor in BitGo (See ""How it works""). See also: Money map
BitGo aims to become a ""service"" which prevents double spending. I thought Bitcoin had that built in. Well this service is only useful if transactions aren't being confirmed in the blockchain (rather, confirmed in, say, a side-chain, like Lightning--Blockstream's developing technology). Surprise, surprise. SegWit2x would literally take power out of the hands of the miners and gives it to central bankers and MasterCard. Interesting that after the decision to ""suspend"" (does not mean cancel) SegWit2x, Bitcoin gets held hostage by ridiculous transaction times.
 
edit: also worth watching this video from MasterCard before they invested in DCG. Notice this guy is just reading a damn script, too. Smh. Probably doesn't even know what he's saying.

"> Segwit fixes a huge issue

no it doesn't.

What issues?

Show me **one** issue that tx malleability was causing. An actual problem, causing distress for someone. Oh? tx malleability was never a problem? For anyone? 


>issue with transaction malleability which BCH still hasn't resolved


I wonder why, could it be, that tx malleability *is not a problem at all?* I mean since no one can show even one example of it *being* a problem, it's hard to say that it is a problem.

But it doesn't matter, the segregated witness code was done (against the will of he miners and community) as a softfrok, which means it has lots of technical debt and almost irreversible complications that bitocin cash doesn't have. If bitcoin cash ever decided tx malleability was anysort of problem they could easily fix it with a clean hardfork and have a much better set up then legacy bitocin.


>t also opens up for further improvements like Lightning Network 

bitcoin cash can do this.

Bitcoin cash can do this better

Bitcoin cash can do this faster (due to no complicated segregated witness code to wrangle with)

Every other alt can (if they decide) do this (if it is ever found to be possible)


>The hard fork was made because there literally had to be major code changes done, e

This shows you don't understand what happened, why it happened, or even basics about how bitcoin works.

The hard fork was done because segregated witness was being added to the codebase and the community didn't want it. In no way does that make it a major change. Segregated witness *was* a major change and by far a more major one. 


>who have found a way to do an Asic boost,

I bet you can't find any proof that this is happening, becuase it isn't, becuase that was a fools narrative that a curstaory glance at would tell any computer savvy person had no merit. 

Even if ASIC boost was really being used, how is that different from going form cpus to gpus or fpgcs? or to asics themselves? What do you ahve aginst bitocin growing and developing? 


BCH actually solves a number of issuse that segregated witness and RBF introduce. Legacy bitcoin has a greater attach surface, more complicated and convoluted code, and more prone to chaos theory break downs. 


>BCH does not have any announcements regarding inclusion of SegWit 


Bitcoin Cash was made **specifically to avoid segregated witness because most early adopters don't consider segregated witness to be bitcoin**. SO of course it won't add it. It *can* however fix tx mallability and do so in a better way than legacy bitocin.


Bitcoin cash (and all alt coins) can add a LN (if the decentralized routing problem is *ever* solved)

It also opens up for further improvements like Lightning Network without actually changing the main code and idea created by Satoshi. 

Increasing the block size to 8 bits technically makes it the same thing as bytecoin.  Bitcoin Diamond does the same thing as well, and there are a lot of other Bitcoin forks that perform this. 

The hard fork was made because there literally had to be major code changes done, even if something as little as increase in block size was only done. 

You also have to understand that BCH was proposed by the Chinese miners, who have found a way to do an Asic boost, which technically makes those that use it, have an advantage, by mining blocks before they are supposed to show up, this in a way creates a monopoly by someone like Bitmain, which have a huge control over mining operations in China.

To whom are you referring...?  Personally, I hold both BTC and BCH,  I actually believed both could survive and thrive, though with BTC tx fees and backlog getting out of hand, I now prefer to use BCH since I can actually use it for payments.

But it seems odd for your post to appear here, unless you have already made the same post referring to the NO2X-Core crowd who continually derides BCH, vociferously calling it ""btrash"", ""bitch-cash"", ""bich-coin"" and ""shitcoin"" and accusing anyone defending BCH of being a ""shill"" or perpetuating fraud.  Their tactics remind me of all those trolls back in 2013 & 2014 who used the same name-calling trash-talk against anyone supporting Bitcoin in those days.  It almost seems like they're the same trolls, reincarnated.

"> All the infighting going on is bad for all crypto currencies in general and ridiculously short sighted.

I disagree. It's bad only for BTC + BCH, while other communities will exponentially benefit from this dispute. Why do we need BTC + BCH if ETH functions right now? (I am not actually asking, I am betting on BTC+BCH)

But I wish people would see that. I wish people would look more on the sum of BTC+BCH.

The sooner we try to re-gain consensus, the better for everyone. I am afraid we are still very far away. Basically I get to visit both /r/bitcoin and /r/btc... read through the comment pages of newly highly upvoted posts and tell people that they couldn't be more wrong.

Over and over again.

I don't see this going away any time soon for either community. Well yeah. But only after BTC+BCH both lose half of the price. And suddenly ETH's market cap is almost as large as both combined.

People don't understand this is a tug-o-war. It does not kill crypto. It kills what we all believe is Bitcoin. I advise non-developers to leave emotion out of this entirely. Yet emotion is all they do.

"There's only room for one, maybe two cryptocurrencies for actual global use as the widely accepted cryptocurrencies. The rest are just speculation and hype. A couple have more niche use cases like smart contracts or ultra privacy. However those things could have been just added to Bitcoin. We're now in the state where Bitcoin Core devs wanted total complete control and didn't allow any innovation outside of their own team. A Not Invented Here syndrome. So people wanting other features had to create their own coin. Now we have too many coins. 3+ for every feature you can think of. Most are just greedy scumbags hoping to get rich off their ICOs, pre-mines and ""accidental"" instamines. We should have all been working together to add these things into Bitcoin with multiple different decentralised development teams. I also think Bitcoin should have hard forked a long time ago and multiple times since to prevent GPUs, FPGAs and ASIC farms from centralising the network. Litecoin would have been unnecessary, as would have a bunch of other shitcoins all trying to bring back CPU mining. It's a real shame for humanity. There is some hope left to bring it all together if BCH can add privacy features and smart contracts but it will still be big ASIC mining pools.

"So fuck them.  Let people believe false things, if they wish. It's to their detriment.  The more false beliefs one holds the more that person is at peril of acting incorrectly in the real world.  I do my part to try and correct people's beliefs to help them, and expect the same from people around me in kind.

If they choose to believe something false -- reality will correct that eventually if it's important enough.

That being said: 
I do agree though that managing of perceptions is important in a social arena.  Money is a social thing, fundamentally, since it governs human-to-human interaction.  So there is some truth to managing perceptions.  But -- I would say at this point Bitcoin Cash has merchant support and the market will sort it out, lies being spread or not.  At the end of the day it's about fundamentals, and Bitcoin Cash has them.

It‚Äôs why I try to move away from default subs, and why I wouldn‚Äôt want to see it happen here, and why I often don‚Äôt go to /bitcoin. The question is: would you rather lose a small bit of subscribers that don‚Äôt come for substance so that you could provide a better educating forum for anyone that looks for information?

"Sorry if I was a bit unclear. The max 4MB recommendation is not from the lightning paper, but from unrelated researchers in their own paper.

The 133MB limit on the other hand is just a back of the envelope kind of calculation in the lightning network paper to show that 133MB might be enough if we want to scale to world-wide Bitcoin use. They don't want 133MB right now. 133MB with linear scaling will never suffice because 133 times 7 tx/s =  ~730 tx/s, which won't do.

Zeroconf is another topic that I won't touch on now. I don't know too much about research on that topic yet. Would be nice to have it secured, but I wonder if it is possible at all (maybe we could allow receivers of outputs to increase the fee to get at least some money).

I don't see how I can ignore developers if they make sound code change recommendations. If there are good reasons for them, I will back individual change recommendations.

"> Bitcoin is still a permisionless exchange.

Is it really?  When the fees hit $1,000 and no one can raise the block limit, and this is done by a central bank owned company (blockstream) then it isn't permissionless.

The whole blockstream campaign combined with the censorship is just a dirty play from so many other financial systems that have been wrecked and then taken over by central bankers.

"The fees are outrageous at the moment, and Bitcoin has become useless for most normal payments because of it.

Both sides have some people who actually think about this stuff and try to understand the changes proposed, and possible alternatives.

"I like that write down. It shows that we care about the same things in Bitcoin. 

I disagree with some parts of your reasoning, though. I'll start with one (minor) thing:

Non-mining can serve a purpose: These nodes make sure that we detect rule breaks and inflation through fake-fees in Bitcoin, in the case that all people (but them) running a full node/miner work together (if not all work together, the person not in on it might tell other people, or join them). This is how they help decentralization and secure the system.

Yes, miners can already double-spend if they control enough mining power, but that's easily detectable and there's not a very big economic incentive. You'd have to spend many coins (that you own) at once, and then roll back the block chain to an earlier date, AND everybody would notice that you tried to scam the receiver and maybe throw you into jail. 
I can't really imagine someone doing a really big transaction that's worth more than a >30% mining business with someone they don't know, and it paying off for the miner in the long run.

On the other hand, paying yourself more fees than is OK is really easy to do, undetectable if you don't validate blocks, and if nobody of the miners speaks up, they all just netted themselves some nice bonus. They could also spend some peoples bitcoin, but then those people might get and verify that one block and tell everybody, even if it cost them quite a bit of money.

I don't think this attack is very likely in the foreseeable future, and I'm not saying that 100MB blocks will stop some rich people from providing that service for free for everybody. Verifying your own blocks does have its benefits because you don't need to trust anybody, though, and a world in which there are just a few miners that can sit together at a big table to coordinate this attack is one that I wouldn't choose if there's better ways to scale Bitcoin :)";2;0;False;bitcoincashthrowx2;drjlm47;Reminder: Core developers used to support 8-100MB blocks before they work for the bankers;7l0oey;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7l0oey/reminder_core_developers_used_to_support_8100mb/

So if there's a chain for the message to go through person making transaction --> someone running a full node for no reason --> someone running a full node for no reason --> a miner, that works fine, but it's only slightly less good than person making transaction --> a miner and has no benefits at all.

"Just a small thing to add, Adam Back was actually the first person to read the Bitcoin whitepaper. Satoshi reached out to him and emailed him an early draft of the whitepaper, which he called ""ecoin"" at the time, in order to get his feedback. Adam Back has not released the emails he had with Satoshi, however Wei Dai (inventor of b-money in 1998) released his emails with Satoshi and in part of the emails Satoshi mentions his discussions with Adam Back:

It spat out the corporatist definition with no caveats, but this policy has serious consequences, that this definition does not even give a cursory mention to, Have any of you seen the video of a overweight black man being choked to death in NYC over selling a single cigarette without collecting sales tax ? Or the others being killed at minor traffic stops ? Broken Windows can never work justly, as long as it is enforced by a Gestapo-style militarized community-hostile occupying police force, that meets any challenge to its unlimited authority with overwhelming force. Maybe that street corner is slightly more 'lawful' and 'orderly', but a human being was brutally killed to make it so, and not by some gang-banger, but by the 'lawful' representatives of the USA and NYC, with no consequences. He wasn't the first, and there have been many more after him, so until there is a balance, I'm finding myself siding with the Anarchists more and more, and I imagine in a group like this I'm probably not the only one. If you think the Nazi reference was too far, this use of lethal force as a first resort was strait out of their playbook, also the term Stormtrooper isn't from the Star Wars universe, so maybe our police shouldn't be dressed and equipped like them (the RL ones) Definitions of politically fraught terms need these caveats, otherwise, they sound like settled matters of social science, when they most certainly are not.

"**Broken windows theory**

The broken windows theory is a criminological theory of the norm-setting and signaling effect of urban disorder and vandalism on additional crime and anti-social behavior. The theory states that maintaining and monitoring urban environments to prevent small crimes such as vandalism, public drinking, and turnstile-jumping helps to create an atmosphere of order and lawfulness, thereby preventing more serious crimes from happening.

The theory was introduced in a 1982 article by social scientists James Q. Wilson and George L. Kelling. Since then it has been subject to great debate both within the social sciences and the public sphere.

It's also amazing to me how high the BCH trade volume is considering there are so few trading pairs for it. Both of these things indicate to me that there is good money to be made by offering BCH trading pairs. Add in the low fee and transfer time to move on/off the exchanges and you have yourself a real winner for exchange trading.

"BTC and BCH both aim for 10 minute blocks. Hash rate is kinda irrelevant for BCH at this point as BCH can get 10 minute blocks with any hash rate. BTC on the other hand does need the hash rate to stay high. If there was a sudden drop in hash power it could be catastrophic for Bitcoin.

Also I think increasing block size is actually a better scaling solution than you core guys lead on. There's a lot of work to be done still but fortunately there are 6-7 dev teams working on it. There's more to it than just increasing the block size but 1gb blocks are looking more and more doable as time goes on.

"Yes, but by increasing the blocksize, it means that better hardware is required to run full nodes. Full nodes are good for transaction verification right?
Also, fees give miners the incentive to keep working so, with very low fees and with full nodes required powerful hardware to work (assuming blocksize much larger than 32MB), won't that provide the capability for a miner to blacklist specific addresses and takeover the blockchain?

Objectively speaking, you're 100% right.

But on a more personal level, I found my way out of the Blockstream propaganda by sheer luck; because I had the free time and interest to start reading everything crypto related that I could get my hands on and thus started seeing inconsistencies. Some people aren't in a position where that is possible and they get caught up in the angry mob.

I feel empathy for other people who are stuck in this drama because they don't know what they don't know. We have a small enough community that statements like mine at the beginning of this chain can actually have an small impact. Maybe.

Do individual opinions matter when the market will inevitably decide this whole debate? Probably not. But it doesn't hurt to show a little compassion to your fellow redditor.

"**Crab mentality**

Crab mentality or crabs in a bucket (also barrel, basket or pot), is a way of thinking best described by the phrase ""if I can't have it, neither can you"". The metaphor refers to a bucket of live crabs, some of which could easily escape, but other crabs pull them back down to prevent any from getting out and ensure the group's collective demise.

The analogy in human behavior is claimed to be that members of a group will attempt to reduce the self-confidence of any member who achieves success beyond the others, out of envy, spite, conspiracy, or competitive feelings, to halt their progress.

"Not in the slightest, when talking about the sizes we are currently at.

It's the economic incentives that keeps bitcoin from being susceptible to a single point of failure or controle. The 1MB limit being advocated by a small group of developers is indicative of BTC being susceptible to both forms of falyer.

No, absolutely not.  Not for any block-size cap increase discussed (eg 4 MB, 8 MB) that might reasonably be needed in the near future.  For that matter you could go to 16 MB, and you would still have tens of thousands of nodes around the world, and yes, you absolutely could still run a node from your home, and yes, that would completely clean out the BTC mempool and tx fees would decline to small, reasonable fees, and yes confirmation times would be faster, and the overall BTC user experience would be far better for many years to come.;1;0;False;sph44;drl7hgs;r/bitcoin is celebrating Gemini because they have no BCH trading pair.
