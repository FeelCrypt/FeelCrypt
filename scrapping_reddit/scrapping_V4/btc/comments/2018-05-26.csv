In any case when the richest person dies the likelihood that all their wealth would go to exactly one other person seems unlikely, and in a free market the chance for someone to ascend to the top and displace that singular successful person is always present.

"It's not for ethereum to decide what does and doesn't need to be on the blockchain.  Just like it isn't apples job to decide what should and shouldnt be an app.  They offer a backbone to the apps and those that have value will remain and those that don't will disappear.  

Ethereum already has off chain scaling options.

"That's fair.  That statement comes from a number of comments from consensys members like Andrew keys citing an analyst study but to your point I don't have the hard evidence in front of me.

Im not sure I need it though, one can simply take a look at the current landscape and surmise that it's an accurate statement.

So while the analogy might have missed the mark slightly due to their review process (one which doesn't currently exist on ethereum) apple isnt the one telling the developer community what the app store does or doesn't need.

I think identity of people can be done, but it would have to be reputation based if it was decentralized. I agree it's kind of pointless to have a decentralized ID that still depends on the government. I see identities of people and things as being only useful so much as they provide added value, such as tracking or trust, but if your private keys are compromised then we need an easy way to discard the old ID and start over. People are not perfect and they make mistakes so we can have these IDs on blockchains, but if someone loses a key then it should be able to start over and start building a reputation / history on a new key. It might set you back, but it isn't the end of the world. I think that's what we need to understand about IDs on the blockchain, is that they represent a digital best-fit identity for whatever you're trying to do not necessarily who you are. They're tools for getting things done online, but the real world is the ultimate source of truth. People might even have multiple IDs to do multiple things online, like reddit accounts. If we take personal IDs on the blockchain too literally then they start to get in the way of life instead of enhance it. That's the idea of creating digital IDs for inanimate objects as well. The ID and history is nice, but if it's compromised then don't use it. It's only as useful as long as it's useful! I have a lot of ideas about human IDs as well, but we're starting with things because it's low risk.

"> It's an immutable ledger. 

Sorry, but you don't understand anything... It's not immutable at all. Not without PoW. When there is not enough difficulty & total work done, you can easily 51%-attack it permanently and make it mutable.

This is why blockchain without PoW makes no sense. Also making 1000 blockchains each with different PoW system does not make sense, because there is less total work in each blockchain so it is weaker and more prone to attacks / takeovers.

The only way blockchains make sense is with a single, global currency like Bitcoin Cash. This way there is the most accumulated difficulty and the blockchain is totally impractical to attack.

I am not even talking about PoS-based blockchains because they always end up centralized (thus being easily replaceble by a single MySQL database)

> lol... blockchain is not a relational database at all.

Well duh. 

Obviously it is not relational in the traditional sense. But blocks have a relation to each other because next block contains hash of previous block's data, also transactions in next blocks are **RELATED** to contents of previous blocks. This is why I said ""kind-of-relational"".

> Maybe you can explain how mysql would store transactions without the risk of tampering?

Well duh, again.

It's easy. Just store Hash of data of every record in another field. Also create multiple backups using replication. This way it is immutable.

"Blockchain is neither safer or faster. It's only safer if it is decentralized, and not owned by one company, NASDAQ. It certainly won't be faster than the current trading systems of NASDAQ, or other modern exchanges, all developed with trx/s as the primary focus.

I watched an entire show based on a project to create a private microwave network from NY to Chicago all to save 2ms off the comm. time for faster trades.

"I’m going to use some analogies here. 

Imagine that it’s a spaceship capable of light-speed travel. Along then comes Satoshi and his team, yet with all their wisdom, could only describe it as a modern day horse and wagon - which to his credit contains a basic description of how a horse and wagon works. So your statement is the equivalent of comparing the horse and wagon (blockchain) to your understanding of a motor car (sql, git). 

Let me ask you this, given basic raw production materials, what is easier to manufacture from scratch - a horse or a car?  There’s enough mathematics in that “horse” to bewilder the brightest of minds ";1;1;False;yezero;dzmc3fe;I'm just gonna leave this here;8m4kuj;https://i.redd.it/2z4whtu132011.jpg
"> ""Blockchain"" is a currently buzzword like ""Cloud"". It doesn't mean jack shit.

I know what you mean. I recall a friend in real life telling me about how blockchain technology is the future, and I just said something in the lines of, ""Yeah, yeah, whatever you say."" It's humorous, to say the least. All these ordinary people thinking they're gonna be Bill Gates or Elon Musk because they invested in, read, or heard about Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies, and blockchain technology.

&nbsp;

Folks, if you invested in something because mainstream media told you it's the next big thing, then you've been outplayed. Simple as that. They certainly won't tell you something's the next big thing because they're angels who care about improving your financial situation or ensuring financial freedom.";1;0;False;cryptotux;dzls943;I'm just gonna leave this here;8m4kuj;https://i.redd.it/2z4whtu132011.jpg
"I can see another powerful reason for using a blockchain: while they are inefficient, they provide a standard, universal protocol that works.

It takes years to develop that kind of thing, and in the end it might be clumsy and people always want to add their personal touch. That is why there are so many video codecs for example (a codec is not a protocol but it's still a data exchange format).

With a blockchain you don't have that kind of problem :the framework is there, you just have to use it. ";1;1;False;jojva;dzlpmeg;I'm just gonna leave this here;8m4kuj;https://i.redd.it/2z4whtu132011.jpg
