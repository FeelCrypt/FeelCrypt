There is also the argument against relating to core. How can it not? We also have issue with how much trolls are coming here lately.

Anytime we have adoption or a positive news, the trolls come out in force. So I guess you are right. It's pretty hard to move forward when we are fighting the narrative of lies constantly.";3;0;False;kilrcola;e4efjg7;Bitcoin finally explained;980sof;https://i.redd.it/7j7ol80vzkg11.png

"I *had* to make a couple of BTC transactions in December and it fucking sucked. The amount of money that I wasted was ridiculous. The worst money transfer experience of my life. After that there was no going back for me. BTC was inarguably broken. 


Don't just hand wave that away. That MATTERS. And Greg Maxwell celebrating that?! Pretty dumb for such a smart guy.


You can argue all day about the technical merits of scaling through Lightning, but there's no way people are going to pay such huge fees for the privelege of using it.


And by the way, I know you come here to try to convince people otherwise, but your comments above about DDOSing your lightning node were embarrassing. You're just giving me more reasons to think of lightning as a piece of shit.";2;0;False;molodets;e4dp7g4;Bitcoin finally explained;980sof;https://i.redd.it/7j7ol80vzkg11.png

"Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is a cryptocurrency created via a fork of the Bitcoin network.

On August 1, 2017, Bitcoin split when there was a permanent fork divergence in the blockchain, thereby creating two blockchains: Bitcoin Core (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH). Bitcoin Cash is the upgraded newer version of Bitcoin which preserves the fast, decentralized, inexpensive qualities of Bitcoin network transactions.";4;3;False;bradvantassel;e4eendg;Bitcoin finally explained;980sof;https://i.redd.it/7j7ol80vzkg11.png
