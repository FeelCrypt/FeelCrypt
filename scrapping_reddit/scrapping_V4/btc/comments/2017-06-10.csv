"Bitcoin isn't here to change human nature, we have to do that ourselves, individually and collectively. Bitcoin is here to provide an alternative to the onslaught of totalitarianism and the trampling of privacy globally, until we can all mature as a global species, and finally learn to take responsibility for managing our own ""ledger"" as a society, instead of delegating it to for-profit institutions that have no checking mechanisms to seigniorage and usury, and have been enriching themselves and their court, through inflation.  

Will it be equitable ? Probably not, as nothing is in life. Those with foresight and those that take risks are always rewarded to some proportion of it, but without using them, you're just a bagholder, so the proverbial ""spice"" must eventually ""flow"", regardless if you mined early or bought in 2010, or just bought your first coins. It will be a long and winding road, but this is the ledger of ownership that's kept society lubricated since the first man traded a bushel of wheat for a silver coin, and the clock's been ticking ever since. Will it be transparent, *yes*; will it be governed by a majority instead of a minority, *yes*; will you have the exact same opportunities to participate as everyone else, *yes*. 

I, and probably many others, consider even these facts alone, to be a big step forward.

">Why is it necessary to download the whole blockchain?
>
>And if you have 10 minutes to mine a block, what difference does it make if it takes a few seconds to download several megabytes of transactions? 

Blocks don't generate after exactly 10 minutes. The incentive is set for miners to be constantly looking for the next block. Having the full block downloaded and verified is a prerequisite to mining the next block. 

It's seems complicated because there is no centralized control. 

Basically there's a math problem to be solved in order to publish a legitimate block. The math problem has a certain difficulty level. The difficulty level is periodically set to match the global hashing (computing) power so that blocks come out about every 10 minutes. 

Sometimes blocks come out 45 seconds after the previous block. Sometimes it takes the entire world's hash power 19 minutes. 

The difficulty level generally goes up, but has on occasion gone down.

"We're in the middle of a very bitter war about how to upgrade bitcoin to make it scalable for the masses.

When it becomes usable again, you won't need anyone to convince you. Bitcoin is both a store of value and a mean to exchange it frictionlessly across borders. It's decentralised and trustless, so it's resistant to censorship by any third party, including governments. It's non-inflationary over the long term.

This is a revolution in money in the making. Right now it's far closer to a speculation asset, you're right, but it's these properties that are driving the speculation. The US legislature just repealed Dodd-Frank, how long do you expect we have again until the next global economic recession? And if the world continues inching towards the extreme right wing and totalitarianism, how free do you expect you'll be able to be with your money, in, say, 30 years?

"Easy. You control the major dev team. This by itself is not enough; anyone could submit a new protocol proposal for the community to vet. So, you combine this with full mod control over the major Bitcoin discussion places. Bitcointalk forums, r/Bitcoin, etc. You use this control over the discussion places to censor any positive mention or neutral discussion over other protocol proposals. Establish your team as the ""one and only TRUE source of expertise"" and badmouth all others. No one can badmouth YOU because you can just ban or censor them. Over time, as the ""true believers"" leave in droves to other subs, or worse other protocols, you have created an ever more insulated bubble of group think that agrees with you. ""Core team is the only legit team. Anything that they don't agree with must be inferior and wrong.""

And thus we see that the weakest point of a decentralized protocol like Bitcoin is the users themselves. Through a clever and dastardly plan of social engineering and propaganda BS-core has gained a very tall soapbox to stand atop of, and an unfortunate amount of users (and shills) who look up to them and parrot their talking points. Even better, these talking points are so designed so as to make BS-core look like the good guys (""sure we want a ""size"" increase, that's what SegWit does!"") and make the rest of the proposals seeking a simple blocksize increase as Satoshi intended look like the bad guys (""Miners just want AsicBoost! Just want your fees! Bitcoin Unlimited is buggy and their team just wants power! Funded by the devil, Roger Ver!""). 

And that's where we stand. Bitcoin is unusable as it was intended to work as long as BS-core is at the helm. There is a growing movement to restore the protocol to functionality, but is it too late?

"I'm not sure we'll ever find a better alternative, or that even if we did, we won't revert back to some level of long tail inequality eventually. This has been the norm throughout history. I feel unless there's some vastly transcendental experience far in the future, people will always be the people we've been throughout it. We'll trade, risk, lose, win as well as lie, cheat, coerce, censor, and wage war to achieve all of the previous.
                        
What Bitcoin does, perhaps for the first time in the history of any monetary system, is harness this inherent greed, so that as you serve your own self-interest, you serve the collective interest of the rest of the participants as well (imo). A speculator will short the highs and long the lows, bringing less volatility. A black hat hacker will eventually teach us better opsec at a cost, etc. The risks of the very early adopters (because I feel anyone getting involved now is still an early adopter), or the work they did in creating it, believing in this system, explaining its intricacies and evangelizing it to others or investing in mining (which in turn protects the whole network for a reward) is worth the potentially asymmetric reward. Maintaining the veracity of a potential global society's ledger, nurturing it from fragility into robustness, building its immune systems, and teaching it to others may be an activity built on many privileges, and perhaps some luck, but I feel its value is unquestionable.

"> Is there a possibility that BTC becomes a holding coin for smaller coins?

Why hold BTC when you can just use the smaller coins? It made sense with gold and silver because gold became so valuable that even a tiny amount was worth too much. You don't need to do that with bitcoin because its very divisible, currently up to 8 decimal places.

The thing with cryptocurrencies is that it is both a store of value and, very importantly, a medium of transfer. All things being equal, why would you hold a crypto that is harder to use?

> As in trading a cheaper in bulk to both transfer value to an expensive coin while making the cheaper coin available on purpose?

There is no reason for you to pay to convert the cheaper coin to the expensive coin, pay some more to send the expensive coin, and pay again to convert back to the cheaper coin. Just use the cheaper coin to begin with. As more people realize this, the value of the cheaper coin will grow as more people buy it and eventually eclipse the expensive coin.

> What would that do to the holding coin over time?

Right now, bitcoin has the network effect by being first. Like mySpace. You use it because everyone else is. But bitcoin is becoming slow and tedious to use because upgrades aren't happening like mySpace. At some point, enough people get fed up and switch to a different crypto like how people moved to facebook.

"Bitcoin, right now, is worth less (by market cap) than PayPal.  

If you don't think Bitcoin has greater potential than frickin' PayPal, and has the potential to offer tremendously more value to the consumer, we have nothing further to discuss.  

PayPal won't let you do transactions they don't like for moral reasons.  Want to buy eCigs with PayPal?  So sorry, no can do.  Are you behind the Great Firewall of China and want to  use a VPN and transact with PayPal?  Forget about it... there will be no evading the dictates of the Chinese government using PayPal.   Want to use PayPal to contribute to a cause they don't like (for any reason, or no goddamn reason at all)?  Nope... not on PayPal, buddy.   Are you a retailer, and want to add PayPal's commission to the price of what you have sold?  Nope.  Forget about it.  You as a seller have to swallow PayPal's load and cannot cost out their charges, even if the buyer thinks that would be fine.

 Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies require no ones permission, and requires no ones trust.  They requrire no license or permission from any government.  They require following no corporate rules... the only rules are those the individual traders decide is best for them.  The potential upside to that change in paradigm, and the freedom to transact business as the traders wish, and not as governments and corporations wish, is immense. As a form of ""digital gold"" and as a storehouse and transport for wealth the upside is huge and will leave the PayPals of the internet eating their dust.

"Bitcoin is above capacity, which means that all new transactions can not be processed within the first 10 minutes anymore. The miners, who do the processing, can choose which transactions they will include in the next transaction block. They also receive the transaction fees of the chosen transactions. Miners, therefore, choose to prioritize the transactions with a high fee included. This results in people including a higher and higher fee to outcompete the rest for the probability of having the transaction completed as soon as possible. If you do not include any fee, your transaction may never be included because there are transactions with fees coming in all the time.

An option is to increase the size of the Bitcoin transaction blocks themselves, and thereby increasing the number of transactions that may be processed.

This was predictable. The amount of processing to perform a transaction goes up over time based on the way bitcoin works. The cost of computer processing these days is mostly energy - to power and cool the computers. Basically, computation is a heater and a cooler fighting each other. And bitcoin is computationally intensive and will get more so. Some advances in tech have increased efficiency, but not as fast as the requirements of bitcoin.;-4;2;False;nroose;diq8k6q;"Average Bitcoin transaction fee is now above five dollars. 80% of the world population lives on less than $10 a day.

Just ignore the people saying don't store money on an exchange.  They are technically right but you can't fix that now.  If they don't get you your coins back the best thing you can do is a PR blitz to their users that this is an unsafe exchange to use.  If they even think that they might lose their exchange over the issue you might just get your coins back.  These exchanges all live and die on their reputations and if that becomes compromised they seriously can lose millions.;2;0;False;JackGetsIt;dipzpf5;OKCoin is robbing me for 97 Bitcoins.;6g8rd8;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6g8rd8/okcoin_is_robbing_me_for_97_bitcoins/
