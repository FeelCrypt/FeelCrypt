You can do billions worth of transactions on Paypal. You don't even have to touch USD directly. None of this is shocking or new. 

Taking users off of Bitcoin's chain and diverting funds away from miners securing the chain does not help the ecosystem, unless you are a large firm/private entity providing liquidity for opening payment channels then it helps you immensely.

Of course the entities investing in Blockstream have been [disclosing this](http://www.coindesk.com/investment-bank-axa-eyeing-bitcoin-for-remittance-market/).

So have [the developers](https://medium.com/@rusty_lightning/dear-bitcoin-im-sorry-fees-will-rise-b002b1449054).

"That chart is borderline useless. Use this: https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/

The question is: how high must your fee be that the tx gets cleared eventually? That depends on the block size (or weight with Segwit txs) and the competition from other transactions with higher fees.

There's always a limit where transactions get dropped, or else tx spammers could write nonsense into the blockchain for free. So it's not useful to ask ""is the mempool full/empty""; instead ask ""are transactions for fee level X getting cleared?""

"My life so far:

- I was born.

- I found Bitcoin in 2009 and loved it.  We got tons of merchants on board and prepared to take over the world. Bitcoin was for _spending_.

- I left Bitcoin for a while and came back last year.  People told me I was a moron and didn't know anything about what Bitcoin was about.  These people apparently joined the project ~4ish years after I did.  The people I admired had left the project.

- People now tell me to use altcoins to get the thing that we all worked so hard to have in Bitcoin. 

The real question is why Blockstream didn't co-opt an altcoin or make their own, not why *I* didn't move to an altcoin when some corporation tried to take over the project..

People insistent on calling BCH an altcoin are just afraid of it supplanting BTC as the true implementation (as well they should be). 



Even if they weren't, there's nothing wrong with ""alt""coins. Many of them serve different use cases and while most of them are trash, there are a few that have definite potential to settle into niches that Bitcoin/Eth/etc don't address.

> The real question is why Blockstream didn't co-opt an altcoin or make their own

Far more profit to coopt the main one, duh.


> not why I didn't move to an altcoin when some corporation tried to take over the project..

Why you and others didn't move, yes. And plenty did, and have profited from such a move.

Bitcoin Cash can remain very cheap more or less forever, assuming it too is not co-opted.  The original vision of Bitcoin is to not to have a limit on block size, except to prevent spam attacks.  Technology improves in terms of price-performance every 18 months.  And yes, decentralization is important, but only to the extent that a 51% attack is very unlikely.

"It's hilarious that you can be active enough in this space to be across this obscure argument and still think that. Of *course* trust can be replaced, happens all the time. You don't trust people's better nature, you trust their self interest, because you both exist within a construct whereby their behaviour will match pattern x *because* of that construct. 

That construct has traditionally been based on either persuasion or coercion, and market forces and money have been on the persuasion side of it, with the exception of the fiat currency debacle and the demonetisation of precious metals, attempting to put both the persuasion and coercion sides under the control of political authority. Cryptocurrencies are simply a reversion to the ancient trend of persuasion being outside the direct and total control of political authority, and the properties thereof are dictated by mathematics and cryptography, just like the properties of gold before it were dictated by stellar nucleosynthesis. 

Both forces are external to human control and thus can be relied upon as natural arbiters against counterparty defection. If you want to cheat gold as a suitable monetary item, you need to compromise stellar nucleosynthesis or similar, if you want to cheat cryptocurrencies as a suitable monetary item, you need to compromise the mathematics behind the backing cryptography. It is actually easier to do the former than the latter, because you can produce precious metals by either nuclear transmutation or particle accelerators at a far more successful rate than you could muster the necessary resources to outcompete the verification investments in cryptocurrencies.";0;0;False;etherael;dm4wwb0;"Gavin Andresen on Twitter ""Hashrate moving to BCH makes BTC fees volatile.

"**Dunning–Kruger effect**

In the field of psychology, the Dunning–Kruger effect is a cognitive bias wherein persons of low ability suffer from illusory superiority, mistakenly assessing their cognitive ability as greater than it is. The cognitive bias of illusory superiority derives from the metacognitive inability of low-ability persons to recognize their own ineptitude. Without the self-awareness of metacognition, low-ability people cannot objectively evaluate their actual competence or incompetence.

As described by social psychologists David Dunning and Justin Kruger, the cognitive bias of illusory superiority results from an internal illusion in people of low ability and from an external misperception in people of high ability; that is, ""the miscalibration of the incompetent stems from an error about the self, whereas the miscalibration of the highly competent stems from an error about others."" Hence, the corollary to the Dunning–Kruger effect indicates that persons of high ability tend to underestimate their relative competence and erroneously presume that tasks that are easy for them to perform also are easy for other people to perform.
