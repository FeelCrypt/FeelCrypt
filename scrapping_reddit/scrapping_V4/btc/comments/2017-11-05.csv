"Well I'm sure big blockers all have their own reasons, but for me personally, I try to do my best to keep the character assassination and slander to a minimum and talk purely about how core is deceiving people. 

Blockstream and Core have been deceiving people and lying to the community about scaling Bitcoin for years now. It is in my economic interests and my moral interests to help others understand the truth that I understand - That Bitcoin is supposed to scale on chain to reach billions of users as a decentralized peer to peer cash system, liberating us all from the chokehold central bankers have over our financial system, taking away their power to steal from us and manipulate economies to create wars etc., increasing our quality of our species. The world can be made into a better place, but I do not believe it can happen without reform of the monetary system, and I believe that reform may be found with scaling Bitcoin as originally designed. The white paper is even encoded into the blockchain, so all this confusion and debate is quite unnecessary. 

So that's my motivation. It's about wanting a better world, a more free world and financial prosperity for myself and for others. The anti-scaling propaganda is very powerful and it is standing in the way of that, and core is complicit with their deceit, but make no mistake, there are bigger forces at play.

"basically the entire community was behind the deign of bitcoin, given by the designer. This makes sense, they read about something and invested in it, they obvioulsy wanted to get what they invested in. 

Satoshi left Gavin in control of Bitcoin, Gavin decided it would be better for bitcoin if he wasn't the only one in ontrol and grabbed a few devs who were around and had done a few commits and gave them committ access. It turns out he did a poor job vetting them. A few years later these devs and the 20 or so regular contrinuters to core ( don't be fooled if people sya it has hundred of commiters, Most made one or two commits, found the people rude, and left never to come back) started to say they wanted to change fundamental aspects of Bitcoin and they didn't care what the community or data supported. They wanted to turn blockspace into a scarcity, to make blocks always full. Well Satoshi explicitly told us how to avoid that, so the community as a whole didn't want that, but the 2 main english speaking bitcoin news forums, btctalk and r\bitcoin, both started censorsing history, facts, and banning people left and right, most of the banned were earluy adopters and people who had knowledge of the system.

""What utility did beads and feathers have?
All something needs to be a store of value or a currency is mutual trust that somebody will still want it tomorrow.""

...and that trust comes from the fact that it is liquid. That you can spend it to transfer into e.g. a house or buy food etc. THAT gives underlying value. 

""Before you say it; yes. The U.S. dollar is backed by the U.S. government declaring that it has value.""

Fuck the government. The US dollar ONLY has value because it has utility. It is no longer backed by gold, so the moment people don't believe in it anymore and hence won't take it as payment (the chicken and the egg), it will tank. Big time. 
Bitcoin (legacy)'s problem is that it's underlying value in that it can be used as payment for various goods (utility) is eroding because of high fees. That will eventually undermine Bitcoin (legacy) as a store of value. 

""The Bolivar is backed by Venezuela in the same way. It doesn't matter without trust.""

That I agree with. 

""In my estimation cryptocurrencies are better at garnering trust because it would take massive cooperation by governments to manipulate them and I just don't see that happening.""

That is true. But as I said, a crypto with utlility will always win over a crypto with low utility and liquity. Bitcoin Cash (or some other alt with better utility) will win in time, if Bitcoin (legacy) keeps having high fees and low capacity on-chain. That is matter simple market mechanics and therefore will it's store of value erode as well in time.

"If the lightning network ends up working (I'm maybe 70% convinced that it will) it will create channels wherein there is immutability on-chain without actually writing to the chain. Think of the lightning network as a protocol for sending bitcoin transactions as packets wherein if anyone stops cooperating then those transactions get written to the chain but everything stays in-channel otherwise.

I foresee LN being centralized; but if you don't like who you are ""banking"" with you can say ""FU"" and force the transaction to persist to the chain, simply by paying a transaction fee and they can't do anything about it - which is good enough in my book. I'm curious who the Visacoin will be; anyone with 100k or more Bitcoin that wants to be I guess.

"The ""mechanism"" is to just raise the blocksize further as was intended. The 8MB cap is just for ultra-cautionary purposes right now, then there is a harder 32MB cap, which can also be raised. This was the original plan. The idea that there is some special ""scaling mechanism"" needed is circular reasoning from the unstated premise that the original plan is somehow flawed.

That said, you make an important point: Bitcoin's value *is* still mainly speculative, and so it's still possible for investors to say something like, ""Well, obviously BCH proved Bitcoin *can* fork to bigger blocks, so any time we *really* need bigger blocks we can do that with a future fork of BTC."" 

The question is how far you can kill the actual existing commercial network effect that seems to be what provides the underlying basis for the speculation in the first place. With $10 fees that network effect has got to be pretty close to dying on places like the dark markets. 

It's again *possible*, though, that investors think something like, ""Well, the whole darknet thing proved that cryptocurrencies work. I'm sold on the idea. You don't actually need to keep using it for commerce now. We can do that later with bigger blocks or LN or whatever works. Let's just pile into the biggest, oldest ledger and wait 'til there's so much investment that the adults enter the room and kick out any idiot devs that may be playing 'big fish in little pond' right now, then we scale and take over the global economy.""";12;1;False;ForkiusMaximus;dpdx8ha;The State of Bitcoin in One Image;7awpft;https://i.redd.it/swiehnikm4wz.png
