"It‚Äôs a complicated question because it‚Äôs so unlike anything we‚Äôve seen before.

I like to compare it to gold. Let‚Äôs break down the properties of gold.

Fungibility - High
Portability - Moderate
Durability - High
Highly Divisible - Moderate
Secure (can‚Äôt be counterfeit) - Moderate
Easily Transactable -  Low
Scarce - Moderate

Gold has a $7-$8 trillion dollar market, and is considered one of the best ways to store value around the world.

Let‚Äôs look at Bitcoin.

Fungibility - High
Portability - High
Durability - High
Highly Divisible - High
Secure (can‚Äôt be counterfeit) - High
Easily Transactable -  High
Scarce - High

You can move any fraction of bitcoin around the world in seconds, without anyone‚Äôs permission, without the use of a bank, and without having to physically move any object.

In addition, its:

- Not issued by a government
- Completely decentralized 
- Programmable 

It cannot be seized by anyone, unlike gold. You can store bitcoin as a memory and take it with you anywhere, unlike gold. You can store the same value in multiple locations, unlike gold. You don‚Äôt need to spend a lot of money to move it, unlike gold. The ledger of all transactions is public and accessible by anyone, unlike gold. There will only ever be 21M bitcoins, yet we can mine for more gold. Anyone in any country can buy/sell or send/receive bitcoin, unlike gold. 

When you look at it like this, it makes a very strong case for bitcoin being Gold 2.0. Why would you buy gold when you can store wealth digitally? 

Currently bitcoin is a $0.17 trillion market, compared to golds $8 trillion. So with some simple math we could work out that if more wealth was stored with bitcoin, the price of each unit will increase in value because of the limited supply.

For example,  if 5% of the gold market moved to bitcoin, that would make bitcoin a $400 billion market. Currently there are only 17,000,000 bitcoins, so $400B divided by 17M put the price per bitcoin at $23,529. 

Is it reasonable to think bitcoin could one day be a trillion dollar market? Sure it is.

Well 1 trillion divided by 17M would put the price per unit at $47,619.

So the question is, will people trust bitcoin and crypto currency to store their wealth better than alternatives? Well, they already are.

And we haven‚Äôt even touched on bitcoins utility yet and all the industries it can disrupt. This is just talking about one use (store of value).";0;1;False;LeeWallis;dqllmyt;It's official! 1 Bitcoin = $10,000 USD;7g9cd3;https://v.redd.it/e7io27rdgt001

"Yes, and like the other reply that outlined the process mentioned .... there are a lot of steps. Especially when you compare investing here to investing in almost anything else. 

That also ignores the issue that if you‚Äôre not well versed in this, there are also a lot of different options for a lot of those steps. Which companies, or products, or sites to use for them is a huge question by itself, and especially as someone who has followed bitcoin for a long time but not actively participated, it‚Äôs really not that easy to keep track of which entities and companies are legitimate and ‚Äúsafe‚Äù to use to handle your money and which aren‚Äôt.

They also endorse violence and derision towards minority groups. r/politics only allows submissions from verified news sources (you can take issue with the bias of a news company all you want, but at least they're more credible than blogs). They also haven't instructed people on how to run protesters down with their vehicles...but that's something t_D loves to pretend never happened (sort of like how a disturbing number of those users deny the Holocaust but secretly really wish it happened all the same)

Try getting your news from somewhere that isn't an alt-right cringe sub or even from reddit in general. Fox, Breitbart, InfoWars are toxic garbage; CNN is also trash but at least not state propaganda; WaPo leans but has been doing solid journalism since Watergate; few take issue with BBC but coverage can be lacking. Avoid opinion pieces from the lot of em.

"First of all. Nothing has intrinsic value. Literally nothing. Intrinsic value of a cow? 2million calories or a divine creature? Intrinsic value of the dollhair? An aggressive government which can project violence anywhere on the planet but which could easily be disrupted by adversaries or from within?  

Gold has little industrial use since it is so brittle, silver could become more valuable if technology permits it. 

I guess you are new to the crypto space.

Tell me. In 50 years when we are hauling chunks of gold back to earth orbit, what will be the value of gold? Do you think we will find 'new' bitcoins on the darkside of the moon too? 

Using cryptography to ensure scarcity is brilliant. Arguably **infinitely** superior to metal chunks or rare gasses which are **infinitely** more available than bitcoin in this universe and which need more energy to collect and maintain.    

But sure you know everything about the btc and how it has no intrinsic value because we should all listen to you and say currency currency currency and not use it as a store of value instead I should primarily use it to pay for my rent. Sure. Hope it works out for you.

If it became a more widely accepted form of currency in everyone's day to day life, not so prone to fluctuation in price, it would be something. But as it stands, it's a redistribution of wealth with potential to cause catastrophic harm to actual economies; to most people.

If Bitcoin were to be accepted at more retailers, restaurants, etc. it might be super useful. Unfortunately the fluctuations in price don't help this.

"I guess the issue most people have is that CC/PayPal/whatever fees are built into the cost of the item. If you pay for any transaction with Bitcoin the fees aren‚Äôt built in. So whatever it is, coffee, a t-shirt, it‚Äôs going to cost me as a customer more than it would otherwise. Transaction fees are also so variable. A year ago transaction fees were never over .50 cents. Now the average transaction fee has been up to $19. Where are you getting 40 cents? Maybe not *right this second* but for today the average transaction fee was $5. You say bitching like it‚Äôs fine and should just be ignored.

People keep changing the goal posts. Originally the general consensus was that bitcoin was going to be huge as a currency, and every retailer that implemented it was celebrated. I remember people talking about the future where you could walk in and order a coffee with bitcoin. Now your fees will cost more than the coffee. But this is going to discourage retailers from implementing it and customer from using it. You aren‚Äôt paying for a useful service. You‚Äôre paying a bitcoin tax for a service you can already do cheaper. 

Yes, solutions are being worked on. But for all these second layer solutions it‚Äôs still going to take a transaction fee to get your money into that layer. All that will do is save you fees if you are making multiple purchases within the same layer, so it‚Äôs pretty much the same problem, or worse because if you move money into that layer anticipating multiple transactions, but don‚Äôt use all the funds then you‚Äôll have to pay *another* transaction fee to move it back into the main ledger.

"Yeah, just like Bitcoin there is a predetermined number of coins. They are indivisible. And you can buy a million IOTAs for about 1.30$ now.

The number of coins may seem huge, but when one puts it in comparison with Bitcoin, with its smallest division of 1 Satoshi, then IOTA only has something like 1.7 times as many coins.";4;1;False;jensZett;dqlp017;Almost everyone now is an Investor;7gonjk;https://imgur.com/nb33jRX

"Correct there is no mining, and hence no fees for any transactions. Instead of mining, each node that initiates a transaction must also verify two other transactions in return.

IOTA is not even based on a blockchain, it is based on a directed acyclic graph called the Tangle. It is conceptually similar to a blockchain but instead of growing in only one direction it grows infinitely in all directions. So theoretically the bottleneck that you have with Bitcoin and other blockchain-based currencies (where everyone has to vie for a spot in the new block added to the growing end of the chain) doesn't exist because any transaction can attach to any other transaction anywhere along the chain.

You can see what it looks like in real time at https://tangle.blox.pm/ or at http://live.iotaknot.com/

On the second one you can double-click a dot to see that transaction. Looks like a lot of them are 0 iota transactions right now, probably the result of spamming the Tangle which is done intentionally to speed up the network.";1;0;False;doc_samson;dqm7yx9;Almost everyone now is an Investor;7gonjk;https://imgur.com/nb33jRX
"I've never bother with any alt coin tbh, I did once have a stack of monero but sold those at around $5 to put back into bitcoin right before it decided to suddenly jump in value a lot. I only to take small positions in alts to trade certain  scenarios like a break of an ATH where you can make a few % and walk away. They are way too volatile and you could be waiting a long time for them to come back to their highs if they do drop. Crypto in general is volatile but at least with bitcoin your more than likely to reach the price you paid for it sooner or later. Bitcoin has pretty much doubled in 3 weeks and it has a solid fundamentals for a crypto. I wouldn't like to say buy it up now but who knows how far this run can go or where it will end, the higher the price goes the more people pile in which creates a feedback loop due to the scarce nature.

I would have thought that we need a serious correction before long to keep going up because this sort of growth is a little insane tbh. Just don't put more than you can afford to lose in it because it's already parabolic and there's a lot of fomo which is a little worrying, I would say wait for a dip but your probably better spreading your buys and cost averaging it and buying a little each week/month. I also really wouldn't ask people on reddit what to buy because your going to get biased answers for the coins that people are in but bitcoin will likely be the coin that still stands years from now unless something else comes along which seems unlikely. The best times to buy is when the media isn't talking about it and it's been going down for a while though not 2 years into the most bullish run in history. Sometimes it does just take off and never returns to those levels ever again though. You never know...

Amazon's only had one year where it jumped nearly 1000%, and that was 1998 when it jumped 966%. In 2000 it dropped 80% when the tech bubble popped, and then dropped 30% from *that* level in 2001. It nearly recovered from that, but then the Great Recession hit. It wasn't until 2009 that it finally returned to that same price from 1998 (adjusting for splits).;1;0;False;hfutrell;dqlk8z1;Almost everyone now is an Investor;7gonjk;https://imgur.com/nb33jRX

1. It's not too late. Very few people know about bitcoin in any real way, and even fewer own any
2. Bitcoin gets first mover advantage, and has a very healthy ecosystem to secure it
3. Bitcoin has been around for several years and has not been hacked, broken, etc.

My take is that if you are in it for the long haul (3+ years at least), diversify, but go heavy on bitcoin. Ether and Litecoin are the only others I know enough about to say they might be viable.

"> Slow bleed leads to currency crisis as the expected value of bitcoins solidifies in people's minds. At first they are conservative, they invest ""what they can afford to lose"". After 12-18 months, their small stash of bitcoins has dramatically increased in value. They see no reason why this long term trend should reverse: the fundamentals have improved and yet adoption remains low. Their confidence increases. They buy more bitcoins. They rationalize: ""well, it's only [1 -5%] of my investments"". They see the price crash a few times, due to bubbles bursting or just garden-variety panic sales ‚Äì it entices them to buy more, ""a bargain"". Bitcoin grows on the asset side of their balance sheet.
