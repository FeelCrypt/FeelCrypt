"Bank runs have happened. . .

And if anything you do ever turns out to be criminal, your accounts can be legally seized, whether you agree to it or not.

But my point isn't about banks VS crypto. I'm just clarifying that the product of this escrow chaos doesn't matter. It could be Beanie Babies that triggered a charge-back. It's not a fault of crypto.

This is about a bad actor, a single company, who's actions were triggered by 2 users using the least secure method of escrow. Had OP used e-Transfer and not released his coins until he saw the balance in his banking app, none of this would/could have happened. Again, nothing to do with crypto, everything to do with a single company handling a situation badly.

If we ever do get decentralized escrows whose only payment option is e-Transfer, this should be nothing but a thing of the past. I'm just trying to keep the focus that it's an Escrow Service at fault here, not the product being traded (crypto)";2;1;False;ROFLQuad;e4jm9vq;"Localbitcoins.com is illegally holding my 9.3 bitcoin on ""escrow"" since may 2015";98uecl;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/98uecl/localbitcoinscom_is_illegally_holding_my_93/

Neither were charged with stealing Bitcoin. Both committed other crimes while in the act of obtaining or laundering the bitcoin.   


Hacking is illegal, laundering is illegal, identity theft is illegal.

But if someone says 'Hold this bitcoin for me and give it back to me later' and you don't give it back. That's not illegal (in most countries)

I had the same thing happen to me from LBC I sold a bitcoin for 1200$ and then released the funds to the buyer, the next day they did a charge back.  When I brought this to the attention of my bank, they too froze my account to 'launch an investigation'  When they found out it was bitcoin related they told me i was shit out of luck because they dont deal with bitcoin in any way shape or form.  I didn't even think to take it further than that.  I wish I had.  I wonder if anyone that has been scammed like this HAS got their funds back.  I traced the ip the guy was using to communticate with me and it showed up as in new york.  He might of been using a vpn though, and that information didn't help me much.  I hate the fact that the bank allows these 'charge backs' to even happen.  I had walls of emal communication to prove that I wasn't making it up.  They also locked my account and prevented me from ever sending e transfers ever again too.  I had to switch banks.  I took my loss.  With 9  bitcoins I might of taken a lot more action, but this is sickening and I cant believe LBC allows this crap to happen.  I don't even know what they could do about it really.  It's in the banks hands now.  It's THEIR decision to approve a charge back or not.

"So dude, you're not Scandinavian I'm guessing, and I am guessing that you have never left the Western Hemisphere. 

The Nordics are among the freest to conduct business, have been for a long time and will continue to be, because we share the same Germanic work ethic that is common to the economic systems of Germany, The Netherlands, The United Kingdom, the USA etc, that being that nothing is achieved if we don't all work. 

We were see it as being different is that if we all work together and help each other, we all get ahead. American Capitalism is ""winner takes all"", ""its me against you"", ""if you get ahead, its only at my expense"". 

We are not socialist, we are capitalist countries with a welfare state or ""safety net"" to ensure that people that the bare minimums to progress in life - education, health, basic work conditions etc are provided by the state and then business can supplement these services or provide alternative ones. 

The economy and the tax base grows, because all market participants have a minimum level of security - I can buy that new television today, because if i fall over at work and break my leg, I know that I can go to the hospital, collect workers insurance and continue to meet my mortgage repayments until I am back at work. 

You say we have been taking ""some socialist measures"" in recent times - can you name one independent business that a government has seized without reimbursement or paying a fair market price and then distributed to the working class? Cause that is socialism.  I think you will struggle to find one, as since the 1990's, the Nordics, like the English, the Germans, the Australians etc have been selling previous government owned industries to private companies. 

Our system is far more stable than the American model - how long can your government continue to subsidise large corporations and the rich and expect the poor and middle class to pay? When the next financial crisis comes along and you already have 25 trillion dollars of debt, and your tax base is built mainly on taxing the bottom of the income pyramid, where are the funds going to come from to bail the banks and corporations out from?

Americans in particular have a very different definition of ""Socialism"" than the rest of the world. A safety net/welfare state is not socialism, it is a fair economic base for all.

"thats why i've been predicting all month that by the end of august btc will be down to $4000

and that by 2020 it will be down to $2000 or less.

besides, if some shit like this happens at a real bank with fiat, you can go in there and talk to someone at the bak about that ...very same day.

with most crypto companies, they have no real customer service, its just an email that no one replies to

my new policy with any investment is to never do business with companies that do not tell you where they are located, and that do not offer human being tech support (no chat bot, not community forums, no webpages with FAQs) if a company does not have a human being i can talk to in case of an emergency or serious problem i will not do business with them, or trust them.

"I apologize for your trouble.

That is quite a bit of money to have tied up in obvious red tape. LBC always seemed to have quality support, but three years is a bit much. I’ve met both brothers with my co-founder and they are really reasonable people. ( full disclosure: I am a Co-Founder of Paxful, also a p2p finance service which many see as a competitor to LBC )

P2P marketplaces are a step ahead of centralized exchanges with automated order books but there are still huge problems with fraud and scammers. We @paxful work tirelessly on this and being in the worlds most challenging markets, Nigeria etc.. only makes the challenge greater (but also means our fraud defense is super tight). We ban hundreds of scammers a day and in those cases, we do hold suspend funds in escrow, but only for those who are proven to have scammed others and then these coins are later distributed to scam victims. I’m not trying to make light of your situation as you are CLEARLY LEGIT nor am I defending LBC or even Paxful, just letting you know things are rough out there in p2p land.

Let me state clearly that THIS WOULD NEVER HAPPEN ON PAXFUL! We have 24/7 support and even a complicated case like this wouldn’t ever take more than a day or two, especially with the proof you have provided. At the very least we can liaise with the bank in question and inform them you were receiving payment for good and services rendered on our platform.

One of our employees has had over 1 BTC held by LBC for over three years as well and they refuse to release it even after he KYC’ed and there was clearly no fraud as he was selling bitcoins. I don’t know their reasons.

Not sure how I can help here but I am willing to listen to feedback. Without vendors, there is no P2P and the reason we exist is that we listen to you guys. We just wish we did a better job of protecting you all.

Please be patient and offer feedback :slightly\_smiling\_face: We love that!

\-Ray

CEO of Paxful

P.S. We are really trying to help the situation in Venezuela now as it has reached the point of CRITICAL INFLATION with two zero's being added in a single day... We are actively recruiting bitcoin sellers in #Venezuela and #Turkey now so if you can help and have bank account in either of those countries please do make an account on Paxful and put up an offer to sell people bitcoins. Even if you just REMIT money to Venezuela if you do it with bitcoin you can make 20% not lose 10% like with Western Union, just put up an offer to sell for a certain amount for bank transfer and give the buyer of your bitcoin the bank account of the person you are sending money too! it works like Magic and they get 20% more and you only pay less than a 1% fee to Paxful for the escrow! PLEASE HELP anyone who sees this. I will make my self available to help you directly and we have an active Venezuela chat on telegram now.

"I’ve been using LBC for several years but slowed down mid last year. I always used the same guys who I know were reputable. I found many traders I recognised actually dropped off the radar during the pump last year leaving a mixed bag of unknowns. 

Your comment strikes home though. Whenever LBC is recommended it tends to be a last resort. There are now better options and if you are concerned with privacy then that can be dealt with other ways. If you’re just interested in buying and using coins then either bisq or Coinbase, bitflyer, Gemini, kraken, bitstamp itBit, etc etc etc. You get the point. 

This isn’t a $20-30 coin anymore. It’s serious money and should be taken as seriously as you would with anything as valuable. Heck, people spend more time to insure their $200 laptops but we will happily send btc’s over the wire to a random with no real claims process. Appreciate the guys in Iran, Venezuela etc don’t have other options but if you do I recommend taking them. The ecosystem is evolving.

"I recently stopped trading on localbitcoins and moved to  Paxful just before LocalBitcoins forced ALL users to KYC...even for cash in person) 

I did a bank transfer trade ( sold BTC for SEPA bank transfer) The guy had perfect stats and longtime LBC vendor whom I have had many successful trades with so when he wanted to buy 1 BTC for 15'000 I had no reason to be cautious (Usually he buys about 1'000USD once a month and never had a problem in two years) 

Anyway it turns out the guy had a gambling problem (or just a scumbag fraudster) and after I got payment and releasing his BTC he claims his account was hacked and the bank took his side and refunded the money since I had no proof I sold him good and LBC wouldn't even give me a statement showing the other guy made a transaction with me. 

Their support took weeks to answer (this was in November 2017) and essentially they cut me off saying they couldn't help and I needed to talk with the bank but of course the bank had already closed the case in the three weeks it took LBC to even reply and I was out of pocket 15K. 

Bank stopped replying to me and closed my account, LBC stopped replying and I lost all the money I ever made in crypto

Since then I have had a much better experience selling on paxful (their support answers in hours and not weeks) and if they have vendor live chat where I can get support if someone is trying to scam me instantly, they even allowed me to move over some of my reviews and stats from LBC once they verified they were legit. (if anyone wants me to put them in contact with their onboarding manager let me know) 

>Now I'm in the process of taking legal action. I've been in contact with over 40 lawyers from Finland, and found only 2 that are looking to take this case and quoted me at €10.000 to €15.000 for civil proceedings,

Look into the history of the East India company. That was a corrupt corporation that started and bankrolled wars in order to keep profits flowing. They sold Opium to the Chinese, (kicking off the opium wars). They also sold humans, not really in the America’s, more in India (they did get out of the slave trade in the late 1700s.)  they systematically overtaxed and drained wealth from foreign lands in the name of the crown.

"You said
>the ""reality"" that the only restraint on businesses in capitalism is concern about their reputation in the public square? that's a sadistic version of anarchism. Read The Wealth of Nations, perhaps you might have an idea of what capitalism actually is.

So I quoted Adam Smith saying that businesses and their owners will do whatever shady shit they want until they're regulated. That's capitalism, not anarchism. Are you schizophrenic or just unable to cope with being wrong?

"Smith saying reveryone bitches about the poor, but the rich are the real enemy:
*We rarely hear, it has been said, of the combinations of masters, though frequently of those of the workman. But whoever imagines, upon this account, that masters rarely combine, is as ignorant of the world as of the subject.*
Chapter VIII, p. 80.


Smith advocating for a living wage:
*A man must always live by his work, and his wages must at least be sufficient to maintain him. They must even upon most occasions be somewhat more, otherwise it would be impossible for him to bring up a family, and the race of such workmen could not last beyond the first generation.*
Chapter VIII, p. 81.


Smith arguing national greatness is dependent upon the happiness of the poor, not the rich:
*No society can surely be flourishing and happy, of which the greater part of the members are poor and miserable. It is but equity, besides, that they who feed, cloath and lodge the whole body of the people, should have such a share of the produce of their own labour as to be themselves tolerably well fed, clothed, and lodged.*
hapter VIII, p. 94.


Smith saying big companies will lie to screw the poor but you shouldn't trust them:
*Our merchants and master-manufacturers complain much of the bad effects of high wages in raising the price, and thereby lessening the sale of their goods both at home and abroad. They say nothing concerning the bad effects of high profits. They are silent with regard to the pernicious effects of their own gains. They complain only of those of other people.*
Chapter IX, p. 117.


My favorite, Smith basically saying it is inevitable that companies and rich people will steal from you if you let them:
*People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices.*
Chapter X, Part II, p. 152.


Smith is saying that producers, companies, rich people, etc. they are all going to undermine the free market if they can and capitalism requires strong regulation to prevent this. Morever, the goal of free market capitalism is the enrichment of the laborer and the happiness of the poor. It's the exact opposite of ""the overt, logical, conclusion"" of putting ""profits over absolutely everything"".



One last Smith quote:
Whenever the legislature attempts to regulate the differences between masters and their workmen, its counsellors are always the masters. **When the regulation, therefore, is in favor of the workmen, it is always just and equitable; but it is sometimes otherwise when in favor of the masters.**
Chapter x, Part II, p. 168.

"It is tangible. It is as tangible as a film on your hard drive or a balance in your bank account. It is more so as it exists in tens of thousands of places simultaneously and cannot be modified. If you honestly think crypto is intangible and this detracts from its authenticity as an asset, you don't understand how many things we value exist digitally and need to educate yourself.

It is usable in many, many ways, not least of all transferring value between parties quickly and anywhere, without a third party. Another very basic example: it enables the ICO, allowing anyone to fund a project without a third party.

Actually I believe it is legally closer to buying a store of value in which that value is the only thing you eventually get to possess, like company stocks or retirement accounts. 

> These Wild West crypto currency exchanges and currencies will always attract bad people.

I'm not sure how you can confidently make this statement. I think that at best, you can say this could be true if either the understanding of crypto, coin vetting, or the crpto/fiat exchange interaction for the end user are not improved, but otherwise, exchanges aren't even that bad today and they've been improving for years. Hell, this is as anecdotal as most bad cases I'll see on here, but I've been using crypto for years without any serious issue.

Maybe, but I think it's only important that the government view it as legal property and allow it to grow. Regulation would also be appreciated.

"> how can they prove that they even have your bitcoin?

Blockchains are *immutable ledgers* which record everything in public view. The value for these trades are held in a multi-signature escrow where two out of three keys combined can retrieve it.

Here is an example of a recent block and the transactions recorded in it.

https://www.blockchain.com/btc/block/0000000000000000000312e467802d6f1e6e3897f8b655a6155f37ecb5d73da1

Bitcoin solves the *Byzantine Generals Problem* without the need for a centralised authority but can arrive at consensus on transaction history through *Proof Of Work*

> These generals wish to formulate a plan for attacking the city. In its simplest form, the generals must decide only whether to attack or retreat. Some generals may prefer to attack, while others prefer to retreat. The important thing is that every general agree on a common decision, for a halfhearted attack by a few generals would become a rout, and would be worse than either a coordinated attack or a coordinated retreat.

> The problem is complicated by the presence of treacherous generals who may not only cast a vote for a suboptimal strategy, they may do so selectively. For instance, if nine generals are voting, four of whom support attacking while four others are in favor of retreat, the ninth general may send a vote of retreat to those generals in favor of retreat, and a vote of attack to the rest. Those who received a retreat vote from the ninth general will retreat, while the rest will attack (which may not go well for the attackers). The problem is complicated further by the generals being physically separated and having to send their votes via messengers who may fail to deliver votes or may forge false votes.

This has nothing to do with crypto and everything to do with an Escrow Service that allows a payment method which includes a charge-back option. Local Bitcoins isn't a scam site. That particular payment method is a scammy way to trade crypto and a USER scammed OP. Happens on e-Bay too.

I've been a trusted buyer/seller on LBC for almost 4 years now. I ONLY use the e-Transfer payment option and everyone else should only too. It's not like you can receive a defective product. BTC will always be ""pristine"". There's no reason to need a charge-back if the escrow service is functional. It's not like buying something on e-Bay and it looks nothing like the pictures or came damaged.

If people only used escrow services for crypto that had no charge-back option, there would be no scams on these services.

"You said they scammed 6 other people and got some of their remaining funds locked.   What's probably happening here is the scammer got away with SOME funds that LBTC's escrow service failed to capture,  and the scammers allegedly scammed multiple people,  so there might not even be enough locked funds in Localbitcoin's possession to fully repay everyone that was scammed,  and thus there might be no possible way EVERYBODY who was scammed is going to walk away happy in this case -- But there's no way they would want to admit that --- That is,  without Localbitcoins being held liable  to someone they can only partially repay.

"I'm sure Paypal can freeze it. There'd be a clear line of legal recourse. But yeah, Paypal kind of falls into that area where it's some website that could fuck you over. It's big enough and follows a lot of laws and regulations though, you'd have strong legal recourse. 

I understand how LBC works, and I understand you would have no way to get your coins back if they simply took them. 
You're simply trusting them as the escrow agent. 

I know LBC didn't scam the client, but they're behaving badly in a way that would not be permitted by a financial institution as as result of that initial scam situation.

And that scammer's particular case is a great lesson for people...something can be reputable for years and then with all that credibility stored up, fuck everyone. 

That's happened again and again and again, something gets popular and has a lot of deposits and someone realizes ""Hmm, I will make more money just stealing all this than I'd get in service fees"" and they steal it all. 

That just can't happen at a bank.

"there actually are some tricky legal issues around bitcoin ownership that could make prosecution difficult under the CFAA.

bitcoin is designed so that anyone with an address and key can destroy a bitcoin and create another (which uses a different key). you don't actually own bitcoin; you possess a key that can cause stuff to happen on a distributed network. the actual act of using your key to cause the distributed network to do something probably isn't ""exceeding authorized access"" on that distributed network because the whole point of the network is that *anyone* with a key is supposed to be able to do that, and no individual gets to determine what access is ""authorized"" on the giant distributed network. or so the argument would go. 

in other words, if you just find a piece of paper in the parking lot with a bitcoin address and key on it, and you use it and it works, it's possible you might not have committed any crime—even if the paper says ""property of [name] and [address]. Do not use if you aren't me.""

I say ""it's possible you might not have committed any crime"" because as far as I know this hasn't really been tested. Obviously, the safest way to avoid criminal liability in the hypothetical above is to return the bitcoin to the name and address listed. and in almost any real world scenario involving theft of bitcoin, there are probably other laws broken in addition to CFAA (wire fraud is still a thing).";1;0;False;oscar_the_couch;e4jqqgk;"Localbitcoins.com is illegally holding my 9.3 bitcoin on ""escrow"" since may 2015";98uecl;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/98uecl/localbitcoinscom_is_illegally_holding_my_93/
