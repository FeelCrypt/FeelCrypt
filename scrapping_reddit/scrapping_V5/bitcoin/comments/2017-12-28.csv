"I'm nitpicking, but rate of return != safe withdrawal rate. It's counter intuitive, but it you can get into trouble if you don't know about safe withdrawal rate studies. 

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/safe-withdrawal-rate-swr-method.asp

A safe withdrawal rate for a 30 year retirement period is 4% or less. If you're in your 20s like the twitter kid in the OP pic (so a 70+ year ""retirement""), you're looking at 1-3%, depending on how much risk you want to take on. 

So a 250k to 750k annual budget is more likely for the long haul. That's obviously rich, it's not 100 exotic cars rich. You'd be spending upwards of 100% of your annual budget on just one car supercar.";2;1;False;;dructu7;What he would be wishing now? 😂;7mgy26;https://i.redd.it/shu3p1cshi601.jpg

"Actually you're half right and half wrong. Someone was selling a very large number of bitcoin at $17250. Because GDAX is just one exchange, the other exchanges may continue to rise higher in price. This causes more buying pressure on GDAX as suddenly the bitcoins on GDAX are 'cheaper' than anywhere else. Imagine you go from shop to shop and everywhere sells cheese for $10.

"Maybe it is, so what? Life’s short and time is money, I can’t afford to sit around whinging about the fact that I didn’t invest in BTC years ago. I’ve got to figure something out for the future, to learn from my mistakes and chart a better course. Yeah, maybe I could have worked my ass off at a summer job for two years at the end of high school, taken that money and invested it in BTC. Yeah, I’d probably have maybe ten or so million by the time we hit peak adoption. So what? I didn’t. I don’t have a time machine, I can’t change that. But if I work hard, if I cultivate my business sense, if I use the money I do make from BTC wisely, I could still hit that point, maybe further.

Hell, there’s innovations to be made now. I’ve been thinking of how I could do a crypto insurance business for small investors or something.

"Consider that there is minimal difference between ""why did I sell then"" vs ""why didn't I buy then?"". The vast majority of the world has missed out on a growth where investing even a days wage - however much or little they earn in a day - early on could have made a major impact on their lives. 

This is what people need to consider with events like that: We all ""lose"" vast opportunities every single moment of our lives through inaction or lack of foresight or lack of willingness to take risks (e.g. almost everyone here likely knew about BTC at some point where we *could* have stretched our finances just a little bit further and bought a bit more, or sold some at some point where we *could* have held on), or because of too much willingness to take risks, and just in general because anything we do have unforeseen follow on consequences.

The only real difference is that most of the time we don't know what we lose out on, because we don't have immediate visibility into the value - financial or otherwise - of the decision we took or didn't take.

So we can let ourselves get torn up over the lost opportunities we can see, or look forwards instead.

"My own philosophy at this point is that if my high risk investments make up more than my lower risk investments, then I sell off 10%-20% of my high risk investments and reinvest in something lower risk. With something growing as fast as BTC that leaves me at tremendous risk of losing lots of paper value, but it also locks in part of the return while letting most of it ""ride"".

It's an easy approach to adjust up/down in terms of how aggressively you want to lock in profits by altering e.g. how large proportion of the total value needs to be in high risk investments before you sell any and how much you then sell, or how often you rebalance (e.g. maybe you re-balance every month given BTC violatility).

The market cap for all cryptos at the moment is half a trillion dollars. It can be 100 trillion by end of next decade, it’s truly revolutionary tech. However, due to the issues we’ve seen with bitcoin, it may never reach its full potential. Too many alts do what bitcoin does but better. This means that it’s very likely that other coins will grow and BTC stagnates. For this reason I suggest that you diversify. Pick 6-8 coins and buy some of each. Buy more of the safe bets like Ripple and Monero.

"Bitcoin does not need to function effectively as a currency to be successful, it is more of a store of value that you can think of like digital gold. Gold is also terrible for day to day purchases. *Payment* systems are a separate thing than gold and we are in the very early stages, but payment systems are being built such as lightning network.

We had cash for a longtime... and only later did we get PayPal, Square, etc.

It doesn't matter what anyone *intended* regarding Bitcoin, it exists as its own entity, beholden to know one. It works because of monetary economics so all you need to be able to do is buy and hold it. Holding bitcoin *is using* bitcoin for what it is better at than anything else.

There are still tons of people who don't get this: people who have flooded this sub, people who were involved early but didn't understand what they were doing so sold or will sell at some price (laptop mining dogecoin in 2013 didn't teach me monetary economics). Plus, all the econo-idiots calling it a bubble when it is more like the pin to the ponzi-like system of government backed debt-laden money. Then you have the 99+% of people who only vaguely started hearing about bitcoin, but aren't buying any. You however asked a question and didn't get offended even when I was rude so you too can be part of that 1%, even if you're not part of the 0.001%.

It might go to zero, but so might the USD. Bitcoin is backed in solid math and threatens USD so I see it as a 50-50 shot. If I'm wrong, I lose what I put in, and keep working to make more money. If I'm right, it goes up 100x or so.";2;0;False;michaelc4;drupyqa;What he would be wishing now? 😂;7mgy26;https://i.redd.it/shu3p1cshi601.jpg

If you look at the numbers on the left hand side, those are open orders. The ones in red are people selling BTC and those in green are those purchasing it. You'll notice when the video starts that there's a large block of open orders for ~1,000 BTC for $17,250.00, whereas the bulk of orders are looking to purchase BTC at $17,249.97 - $17,249.99. The numbers scrolling down on the right under Trade History are trades that are going through on the exchange. You'll see that these are all being processed at just below $17,250.00 at the beginning of the video. The chart in the middle shows where the price is and how much demand there is to buy BTC (green) or sell BTC (red) at a specific price. At ~1:30, the price finally moves above $17,250.00 and all of those orders to sell go through. In last 30 seconds the price runs up to $17,449.99.;71;1;False;Beowulf_88;drumetx;What he would be wishing now? 😂;7mgy26;https://i.redd.it/shu3p1cshi601.jpg

So, I really had no idea what was going on in this clip, I’ve never been onGDAX so it all looked foreign to me. But from what I know, I think what happened is that someone sold a large amount of bitcoin (~1,000) and that in turn free’d up a lot of coins, making them available to buy at a lower price. So then people started buying those coins and that adjusted that price wall? This is really all a guess from the bit I know about crypto, so don’t quote me on any of this lol. ;1;1;False;Boofthatshitnigga;drulye9;What he would be wishing now? 😂;7mgy26;https://i.redd.it/shu3p1cshi601.jpg

"Except there aren't that meant lambos out there. I'm holding; don't get me wrong, butt am I incorrect in thinking that buyers at 15k aren't future millionaires?


Maybe my assumptions are faulty, so please correct me if I'm. wrong. I bought ~ $700 worth of btc -- most at 10k per btc, and a couple hundred at 15k. I'm not going to turn this into a million bucks. I also invested about equally intolitecoin and ether. And I'm holding all of it. 



It's getting media attention now, and coinbase seems to be growing exponentially. I just don't think there are that meant millionaires out there.  There can't be that meant people that wealthy. So what is the ceiling? How much can 1 or 2 thousand bucks worth of bitcoin now be worth, at the most?  Assuming best case scenario, I won't be a millionaire on byc alone.  No way. Maybe turn it into 50k...but even that seems high.  I say max..... 10x what it is right now.

Investing and waiting for greater returns is all well and good, but at the end of the day it's still money. If you're holding just to maximise the money you'll make, then you're better off withdrawing and actually enjoying the money you've made. I'd rather look back and say: ""Hey, if I'd left my money in there I'd have loads more now, but I would have missed out on the cool stuff I did with it"".

If you want to make money, and you've held for over a year already, why not take some out and go wild (or not wild)? Otherwise, what's the point, what's your endgame? To make more money? Then what? Leave it to make even more? Where do you stop?
You have to withdraw one day, and you never know which day it is that you'll get the best value.

Now if you're holding onto it for a belief in the technology, that's a whole different kettle of fish that's completely unrelated to its exchange value.";73;3;False;;druahqt;What he would be wishing now? 😂;7mgy26;https://i.redd.it/shu3p1cshi601.jpg

What’s worked well for me has been a partnership with somebody else. We make a great team because our coins can’t be sold unless we both agree, which prevents impulsive selling. There has been times I wanted to sell (more than I’d like to admit), and she talked me out of it every time except once when I desperately needed the money. And there’s also been the odd time she wanted to sell and I talked her out of it.  Because of this we have been able to reach higher gains (at ATH) and hold on to 90% of our original balance.;2;0;False;bwillzy;druruhs;What he would be wishing now? 😂;7mgy26;https://i.redd.it/shu3p1cshi601.jpg

There is a pretty popular post on Bitcointalk from some years ago that says exactly this- if Bitcoin ever trades for $10,000 it must mean USD is now worthless.

Obviously, this isn't the case, Bitcoin has appreciated to such a value without a real world doomsday.

I think most people would sell when it hit $100K or $1M or $10M or slowly take some off during price spikes.  

Even $50K can be live changing amount of money for some people (if it means them getting out of debt or having some security).  You can't retire on it, but if you gave most people a chance to cash out at $10K or $50K, I think they would, or at least partially.

There actually is a guy doing similar to that, holding a bunch of coins, but more for experimental reasons.

It won’t be the first time bitcoin goes up like crazy and loses a ton of value. But it has always come back bigger than before. If there is a crash short term, we’ll see another steep rise in 2021, shortly after the halving event. There was a halving event in 2016 and we saw a huge rise in 2017. ;1;1;False;JuryNightFury;dru7o2t;What he would be wishing now? 😂;7mgy26;https://i.redd.it/shu3p1cshi601.jpg

"Hey man... 

What you are doing here is incredible, not just because of effects your funds will create but also because its an incredible thing in on itself, an action that shows to many people such things can be done and are real, which will have further beneficial consequences multiplying.

I hope you do this as smartly as possible.

There are many many charities as you know, and much more money couldn't cover them all. There are many in my country and many in dire need for assistance right now but, im not going to ask for any of them. I mean to do something about it myself, if i manage to achieve some things.

I will take this opportunity to turn your attention to two causes which potentially have enormous positive consequences on whole humanity if they succeed, for many years into the future.

I see someone already mentioned companies and research going into lab grown meat and similar technologies. I assume you know something about it. But i would reiterate and shortly explain how gigantic that can be. 
Far, far more important then just what we eat. If those companies succeed it will be first time in the history of this world that any living organism had successfully broken out of the food chain. That can change.... everything. 
The immediate benefits will be huge and direct for people health since multitudes of diseases, pesticides, carcinogens and all kinds of general pollution will be removed from our food. Hunger can be truly eradicated from the planet, majority of ecosystem will be able to recover which will again benefit every single human now and far into the future - and we will stop destroying everything including climate to grow animals - to kill - to eat.  The consequences reach further and deeper than that but im trying to be short and to the point. The rest you can figure out and research yourself. if you dont know already.


The second is this guy: 
https://www.ted.com/speakers/anthony_atala
http://mcb.graduate.wfu.edu/faculty/anthony-atala/

It may very well be his research is already well funded, but its worth checking out. The potential benefits here are so humongous, incredible and so extremely far reaching  its difficult to describe them in short. Dr Atala project would not only save lives in short term and completely change the systems of organ transplants, but provide biggest most powerful solutions to numerous deadly diseases, would help eradicate or cure and minimize many different cancers, save kids, people, ...  and extend lives of everyone.

While it may very well be crucial for future expansion into the solar system of ours too.

In a sense, supporting these two research projects and or technologies will work extremely positively on all problems all charities in the world are trying to help with.

Its the proverbial teaching humans to fish instead of giving them a fish. 

So, just think about it, please.

You are the man, man. I commend you on your extraordinary deed. ";2;1;False;SurfaceReflection;druriry;I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes! Introducing The Pineapple Fund;7jj0oa;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7jj0oa/im_donating_5057_btc_to_charitable_causes/

For what it's worth, I (and Animal Charity Evaluators, too) think [The Good Food Institute](https://animalcharityevaluators.org/charity-review/the-good-food-institute/) might be the best place to donate to this cause:

> “Based on ACE’s thorough analysis, we are convinced that GFI is one of the three best nonprofits for donors looking to maximize their positive impact for animals. We are impressed by GFI’s leadership, strategy, transparency, and commitment to metrics and accountability.”

Can I be considered one of those charitable causes? Seriously, between the cancer and my genetic condition 2017 was a really rough year financially, and its only gonna get worse. But anyway, it really is a beautiful thing to see someone behave selflessly these days- may the kindness be returned to you threefold in one way or another!;1;0;False;prophyria;druldww;I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes!
