"Hang on, you're kinda losing the point here. . .

Paypal CAN freeze your account just like LBC froze this guy's account. E-Bay's escrow service has the same checks-and-balances for charge backs and sometimes they also end up in a bit of chaos and delay.

However, OP wouldn't even have a problem if a USER hadn't scammed him. We don't blame e-Bay directly when a user gets scammed and initially LBC didn't do anything wrong.

Now, the delays since? Yep, as a company trying to be professional, I can't defend them or these actions. Not at all. But that's a company being unprofessional on a business level. It's not like LBC set up a predatory account to slowly become one of the most trusted users on their own site, then to flip the coin and start scamming everyone.

Ultimately, if you just pair escrow with e-Transfer, there's ZERO room for scamming (why everyone doesn't just use e-Transfer is beyond me). The crypto sits in escrow. The cash is sent out of users bank account with no option to reverse. Crypto seller confirms the money made it INTO their own bank account and notifies escrow service. Escrow releases crypto and there is ZERO room for scamming.

Remember, this has nothing to do with crypto and everything to do with an escrow service. If the only service was to conduct trades without the chargeback option, there would be no room for scamming.";4;1;False;ROFLQuad;e4jjayx;"Localbitcoins.com is illegally holding my 9.3 bitcoin on ""escrow"" since may 2015";98uecl;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/98uecl/localbitcoinscom_is_illegally_holding_my_93/

Why do you say there is ""a lack of clear politics around dispute resolution"" ?

2/ Bisq runs now for more than 2 years, and had zero issues like the one related.

Yes, this is certainly partly due to Bisq being actually a small market place. But mainly it is due to the fact that Bisq is rather conservative (and Bisq is criticized for that) and that Bisq has cautious mechanisms already in place which exactly make the kind of above scenario impossible.

"No. At least certainly not this exact scenario.

1/ Bisq has limits (often criticized by many people) which would simply not have allowed to reach the amount related in the scenario

2/ if there is an issue between buyers and sellers, the deposits get at worse blocked in the 2/3 multisig deposits address. afaik this did never happen since Bisq network is running.

3/ The case where an arbitrator could become rogue has been considered. To become an arbitrator in Bisq, you have to bond some money (currently it is 20.000 BSQ) and you must be approved by the stakeholders. For an arbitrator to become rogue, the gain must at least be superior to the bond.

">Surely that is a risk the bank should insure agaist instead of reversing a payment made to you. 

One would think, and I made this point to the multiple reps that I spoke to.  I completely understand that the legitimate bank account holder is out the money, but I felt that it was completely unfair to hold me responsible.  I made a transaction in good faith, and it's not my fault that the other party's account had been compromised.

Anyway, I ended up being overdrafted around 1k (after I'd already lost 1k), and I simply told the reps that I would not be funding my account until the payment reversal were fixed.  That never happened, and they closed my account (but did not come after me for the remainder).  Thankfully I had the majority of my savings at the time in places other than my checking and savings accounts; if I hadn't, I would never have seen that money again.

>As for you as a recipient, it is your responsibility to make sure the funds have cleared into your account before releasing escrow.

Oh, believe me, I did.  The payment reversals came several weeks after conclusion of the transaction.  The buyer had relatively good feedback on LBC, though their account was newish (this was another mistake on my end--be VERY wary of new accounts on LBC), but right around the time the reversals came, a bunch of bad feedback hit their account, and LBC suspended them, but they'd already withdrawn the BTC from their account so there was nothing they were able to do for me.

"Just FYI. 

We haven’t gotten anything back yet. 

The original decision of the court was to give us $480 per bitcoin, and give the extra many many millions (I think it was over $100m) to karpeles, which would have sucked ass. 

Now they’re changing the legal proceeding from bankruptcy to civil rehabilitation and will simply distribute everything to us, as much as is left. 

However, even then we will only get something like 15% of our bitcoin back, since so much was lost.

"They got the cash back which was an agreed price I believe of $320.. 

But, they now are going to be getting some of their bitcoin back, its going to get divided based on fair percentages.

My whole point is, that while I feel bad for all of the Mt Gox people who lost their BTC, there is NO CHANCE that 100% of them would have held onto their Bitcoin as bitcoin reached prices levels of $1000, $2000, $5000, $10000, $20000.......Some may have held, but the majority in my opinion would not have. So while many feel they have lost out on $1000s of dollars, a lot of them would have sold in 2016, and early 2017.

It's advantages are also it's limitations, you can't buy any serious purchases without depositing some bitcoin first (so not a good onramp for new people), also you can't add multicurrency accounts, like if you have an account in EUR and USD you can only choose one and then limit your trading pool to that specific currency.

It was Bank of America.  I'm not the only one this has happened to either.  What happens is that somebody will have their bank account compromised, they'll buy BTC from you for a bank transfer, then the actual account holder realizes what happened and the bank will hold *you* accountable while somebody in China makes off with your BTC.  They won't be interested in any documentation showing that the transaction was made in good faith, and that your crypto is gone.  There are things you can do to mitigate the risk, but sending somebody crypto in exchange for a bank transfer is inherently risky.

"Bankruptcy proceedings for Mt. Gox have ended, and they are now undergoing Civil Rehabilitation.

It is currently unknown how this will proceed, whether via cash, BTC, or some combination.  By all accounts, the Trustee has enough cash from the sales earlier this year to make creditors whole at $483.  That leaves the remaining Bitcoin in question.

They're currently gathering more claims from creditors, so it's too earlier to tell what will actually happen.

American lassies-faire capitalism is not the only kind of capitalism. Its still capitalism if there are large social safety nets and a regulated market.

They don't ""regulate that capitalism"". They regulate free markets that exist within capitalism. Its not semantics, there is a difference.

>Come on now, that's silly. I'm ok with capitalism, but not this appeal to tradition.

Countries move towards capitalism because its clear that capitalism provides the most wealth and better quality of life for its citizens. To call it an appeal to tradition would be to ignore the entirety of world history before capitalism. Its a relatively recent thing.

Its not like capitalism was exported to the rest of the world. These countries adopted it out of self interest.

"Lessons?  

1. Never accept reversible payment methods for large amounts.  Risk management is a part of business.  

2.  Never keep more on LBC than you need for daily transactions.  You can manage a minimum balance with regular deposits and withdrawals.  

3. LBC accounts are regularly bought and sold. Never assume reputation is a guarantee.  Again, risk management.

"Hello,

Bisq :

\- secures exchanges thru limited amounts when dealing with fiat

\- secures exchanges thru use of multisig adress

\- secures exchanges by asking mutual deposits

\- provides a human arbitrator in (rare) case of dispute

atm Bisq is a small marketplace, with an average of \~30 trades per day, but since the beginning Bisq has (very) few arbitration cases, and absolutely 0 case like this one.

There were some few case of chargeback issues, but limited due to Bisq limit policy with fiat. In the 24H/48H following those issues, the concerned payment methods were removed from Bisq (even if it was of course a bizness loss).
