Coinye, formerly Coinye West, is an abandoned scrypt-based cryptocurrency that became embroiled in a trademark infringement lawsuit for using the likeness of American hip hop artist Kanye West as its mascot, despite West having no affiliation with the project. The project was abandoned by the original developers following West's filing of a trademark infringement lawsuit against them.

I don't disagree with the network penetration point.

As for the valuation of bitcoin, I personally think there’s numerous ways to look at it, in fact numerous ways you need to look at it. just like with stocks. There’s fundamental & technical ways of valuating stocks. There’s endless variations from each perspective as well, and endless combinations of both. There’s no single answer to ""what is a bitcoin worth"". That's why there's so much volatility. In the end we'll see it's the balancing of numerous different ways of valuating it.

"You're missing the point. Unchecked growth isn't necessarily a positive for a value storage either.

The whole point of finding a way to store value is to keep it as stable and predictable as possible. Ideally having its value tied to or backed by very stable and predictable factors.

The reason people love gold as a store of value, for instance, is that it's a known quality that is very likely to not change in radical ways. Ie.

* gold does not rot
* gold does not corrode
* gold cannot be produced in any meaningful quantities and certainly not cost effective
* the laws of physics place a limit on the amount of gold available, found and unfound

At the same time, the value of gold has an inverse relationship to the economy. If the economy is doing great, the gold price sinks slightly. If the economy is doing poorly, the price of gold goes up a bit. Very predictable changes.

I'm not making an argument for gold over bitcoin but that is what makes a good store of value. Predictability and stability. Bitcoin has neither.

At the end of the day, bitcoin is not a store of value. It's not a functional currency. It's not an investment. It's not a money transfer system with low fees anymore. It's a gamble that can pay off.

And the only problem I have with that is that I never got into bitcoin because I wanted a profitable gamble. I wanted a currency or a money transfer system and it stopped being that.";2;1;False;TheSecretMe;ds9of8u;Warren Buffet:;7o9zo1;https://i.redd.it/epko0verp7801.jpg

"if a coin pays a dividend its probably a scam. if five people own a coin, and they each receive a coin, they don't get more money, their coins are just worth half as much as they used to be. and each of them now have two so there is a net change of 0. the only way I could possibly see a dividend coin would be if there was some kind of price control. and that doesn't make any sense  because the only reason why cryptocurrency is even a thing in the first place is because they are trying to de-centralize currencies, not to shift centralization from a public authority to a private one.


when you buy a stock of a company, you are buying a percentage of the business, so when that business makes money, you make money. sometimes that business will pay out the money it makes out to its investors. in that case you would receive money. this is called a dividend. what usually happens is that the business buys more equipment with the money it makes, or opens new locations. in this case, the price of the stock goes up because the percentage of the business you bought is worth more. a price goes down when a business looses money and they have to sell things to stay in business. which means the percentage of the business you bought is now worth less than when you bought it. you should only buy a stock based off of value, not of price. not of how fast the ticker is going up, not based off of what other people say. you need to read the financial statements, and get a good idea of what the business is worth. if its a good price then pay it. too many people don't know what they are doing and they create huge spikes and crashes in the economy and that all can be summed up with simple behavioral economics. they buy when they are greedy and they sell when they are scared. don't pay attention to them. 

so basically you should use your cryptocurrency to buy stocks, and then take payments in crypto. if they don't offer dividend payments in crypto, then accept USD and convert to BTC. 

once again. cryptocurrencies are not investments, they are medium of exchanges. if you want stable growth you should exchange your medium for a percentage of a business you think will be profitable years form now. 

the easiest way to loose all of your money is to throw it around without knowing why you are throwing it around. so read up on what you are investing in beyond ""its the future"" everyone knows its the future, which is why everyone is paying exurbanite amounts for it. which is why there isn't any profit in it. 

if it was easy, everyone would do it. and when everyone does it, they compete the profit away. there is no simple coin you can buy that will make you money 50 years from now. you have to actually do research yourself to find out what is the best investment, because if there was a simple buy, everyone would and there wouldn't be any money in it anymore.";2;0;False;;ds91bay;Warren Buffet:;7o9zo1;https://i.redd.it/epko0verp7801.jpg

You need death. Because..you need life  after death. You need a legacy. You need something to show that you remain, and the quality of your remains is what will dictate “how long” after death you get to live. Actual immortality makes life meaningless. “Oh..I only have an infinite number of years to accomplish it, so I’ll just chill for now.”
When “life” was first designed, the first line of code was to include “death”. It is the most fundamental part of life. That you are finite. That you will disappear, and the only thing that will remain is your “legacy”, however you define it.
