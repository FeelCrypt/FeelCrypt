">  Problem is that (relatively) no one’s spending it on goods, just buying and holding in hopes of getting rich.

I think it's basically designed that way. It's designed to be deflationary, which effectively means that you can generally come out ahead by hoarding your stash rather than spend it.

That's the entire reason central banks try to target a reasonable amount of inflation.

These are important points. But its necessary to realize that bitcoin isnt a finished product. Like many things and products its always evolving. I mean you look at Amazon, Apple Netflix etc. what did thy start out at? Bitcoin is still relatively new (under 10 years). The ability to spend it as a currency is coming. Theres millions of dollars and tons of developers working on this and many other features. I agree, its somewhat like a bet but its also could be highly speculative investment. I would say people are betting that btc will be used in some form or fashion for years to come. If it just exists it will maintain value. Obviously many people are pouring there money in and yes it is dangerous. But i dont see this going to 0. Unless there is some sort of major even that shakes it (which is entirely possible) i think it will continue to evolve and change.;1;0;False;ImAjustin;dr7uack;Nothing can increase by that much and still be a good investment.;7jht7c;https://i.imgur.com/oWePY7q.jpg

"Because the crazy thing is there shouldn't be any risk of not paying back your student loan, because it should be paid for by taxes, or it should be very affordable.

In the UK universities were free only 10-15 years ago, now we're expected to pay off our massive loans over 30 years as if it's taxed. But over that 30 years, you'll be paying more in interest than from the cost of paying for University.

I get your point that mortgage loans should be cheaper because of collateral, but the whole point is that's to mitigate risk for a privately owned bank, for when you purchase your privately owned house. But there shouldn't be risk in paying student loans, because it's forced out of your income via taxes, you can't default from student loan debt in the UK. At least right now.

The only winners in this situation is the banks, and my point was that as the government own the central bank, which rate was at a historical low, could've gave the courtesy to provide the loan themselves at a low rate. Instead because of all the corruption, we are the first generation in the UK to pay US  mortgage style University fees. We got completely fucked over.

"> Because the crazy thing is there shouldn't be any risk of not paying back your student loan, because it should be paid for by taxes, or it should be very affordable.

That's entirely beside the point. The loans exist, they're for significant amounts, and they're unsecured, so it makes sense that they'd have a higher interest rate than a secured loan.

> my point was that as the government own the central bank, which rate was at a historical low, could've gave the courtesy to provide the loan themselves at a low rate.

That's a pretty dumb point, then. The risk of a random 20-year-old with possibly no income and definitely no significant assets defaulting on a debt is substantially higher than the risk of a bank defaulting.";1;2;False;im-a-koala;dr7xiy9;Nothing can increase by that much and still be a good investment.;7jht7c;https://i.imgur.com/oWePY7q.jpg

In addition, a maximum amount, varying year by year, can be given by an individual, before and/or upon their death, without incurring federal gift or estate taxes: $5,340,000 for estates of persons dying in 2014 and 2015,  $5,450,000 (effectively $10.90 million per married couple) for estates of persons dying in 2016.

"**Estate tax in the United States**

The estate tax in the United States is a tax on the transfer of the estate of a deceased person. The tax applies to property that is transferred via a will or according to state laws of intestacy. Other transfers that are subject to the tax can include those made through an intestate estate or trust, or the payment of certain life insurance benefits or financial account sums to beneficiaries. The estate tax is one part of the Unified Gift and Estate Tax system in the United States.

"I feel like you're responding to this as if i'm talking about US university tuition fees, when i'm talking about the UK.

Although it is now a significant amount, you will be paying this for 30 years like taxation, if you don't earn a large salary you pay £0. If over 30 years you haven't paid this debt off, the government pays off your debt for you.

Now where is the risk for banks in that transaction? None, it's virtually risk free. And a risk-free loan should demand a much lower interest rate than a mortgage, because you can definitely default on a house, as many people do. Under the current format, no student will default on their student loans.

Thus my point, this is corrupt as fuck, at least from a UK perspective, because banks will be profiting £bns every year from students.

Look, nothing is exempt from the invisible hand. You know that because your views are decidedly libertarian in what I've just read. No one looks at our currency and goes ""My god I wish it was censorship resistant"". That's crazy, nonsensical garbage and it is completely irrelevant to the point of currency.

The same goes with the new academic buildings. They're very flashy, and they look nice, but it seems like they're focusing more on ""how can we get our campus to look nice?"" than ""how can we rein the budget in while still providing a great education?""

Personally I think new student loans should just be dischargable under bankruptcy. Then lenders will stop lending money to people who obviously won't be able to pay it back.

"Laziness could save your ass at the same time.  It’s a world of chaos we live in, you never know what is going to happen.  My being lazy and not going to the gym today may have saved my life.

The flight he was supposed to be on didn’t make it to the destination, instead, it ended up slamming into one of the twin towers.

In this case, yes, your laziness cost you a lot of money.  But had you made that money, your life would be entirely different from what it is today.  A lot of good, and bad things could have happened in that time frame.  Sorry to get all philosophical; I just find it so fascinating that the tiniest of changes in ones life could have catastrophic results.

"Under a dollar was whatever and I can't really say about what opinions or reasoning people had back then since at that point it was barely notable on slashdot or maybe hackernews or whatever. And Satoshi was still around working on getting it working at a reasonable level first. Wasn't really much of a market until it hit parity with the USD in early 2011 and there was finally a 'legit'(lol) exchange. At that point it spread throughout the internet quite a bit leading up to the first major bubble to $32. Not only that but it was already hitting mainstream news and you had politicians like Chuck Schumer publicly speaking out against Bitcoin. So it was on the radar pretty early so to speak.

And by then there were absolutely people who were buying and predicting some 'insane' scenarios of how it could take off. Just go back and read bitcointalk archives if you're interested. Lots of crazy people on there from various walks of life who held particular world views that Bitcoin spoke to on a very deep and fundamental level. Even when it went back to $2 then floated around $10 around 2011-2012 there were a lot of people who were very serious and very optimistic about what they thought was going to happen and they absolutely deserve credit for taking the risk that they did. If you ever spent time on bitcointalk or even here over the years you'd know how common the seemingly arrogant idea that Bitcoin was extremely likely to be worth a lot of money is/was.

This is dangerous investing. If all it takes is simply to throw money at small companies then many people would be wealthy. You need to view what you’re doing as playing the lottery. Buying a bunch of lottery tickets would make you rich as long as you hit one right? But most people don’t put much into lottery or at all because the likelihood is so minuscule. It’s a much safer choice to keep putting into your 401k. Crypto and stock market gambling should be a small portion of your investment portfolio. ;40;2;False;turtleneck360;dr8xepe;"Danish Bitcoin billionaire new sponsor of professional Danish ice hockey team.

"> It's barely a currency. It's like commodities trading at this point in time.

No it's pretty much a currency, it's not fiat but it trades against the USD/CAD/Yen/Euro. 

Just because fiat markets have shoved it into the commodity asset class doesn't make it not a currency. They just don't want to believe it's a currency since it's not government backed.

"Yeah, that is a better term. I'll call it that from now on.

Fun fact: wikipedia already has crypto included in their definition of ponzi schemes.

>Cryptocurrencies have been employed by scammers attempting a new generation of Ponzi schemes. For example, misuse of initial coin offerings, or ""ICOs,"" on the Ethereum blockchain platform have been one such method.[11] (per the Financial Times, ""smart Ponzis"").[12] The novelty of ICOs means that there is currently a lack of regulatory clarity on the classification of these financial devices, allowing scammers wide leeway to develop Ponzi schemes using these assets.[13]

and 

>Economic bubbles are also similar to a Ponzi scheme in that one participant gets paid by contributions from a subsequent participant (until inevitable collapse). A bubble involves ever-rising prices in an open market (for example stock, housing, **cryptocurrency**,[14][15] or tulip bulbs) where prices rise because buyers bid more, and buyers bid more because prices are rising. Bubbles are often said to be based on the ""greater fool"" theory. As with the Ponzi scheme, the price exceeds the intrinsic value of the item, but unlike the Ponzi scheme:

(cont,  explains bubbles for those unaware)

>In most economic bubbles, there is no single person or group misrepresenting the intrinsic value. A common exception is a pump and dump scheme (typically involving buyers and holders of thinly-traded stocks), which has much more in common with a Ponzi scheme compared to other types of bubbles.
Whereas Ponzi schemes will typically result in criminal charges after they are discovered by the authorities, other than pump and dump schemes economic bubbles do not typically involve unlawful activity, or even bad faith on the part of any participant

"Bitcoin being the first doesn't mean its not survivor bias to just look at what coins succeed and which don't and use that as proof of who had the right predictions.

There were lots of first to markets in the dotcom bubble, it doesn't mean you could accurately predict which companies would become Amazon and which would become Pets.com.

Looking at the past to predict the future is a classical gamblers fallacy. You need to be able to predict the future before it happens, not just look back at the past and say ""the guys who picked the winner knew what was going to happen"".

No one has been able to prove they can accurately predict what will happen with the coins markets ahead of time. You will always be able to look back at the past and find winning predictions because of survivor bias. If you predict bitcoin will go up and I predict it will go down, one of us is going to be right.

"Mining energy use is in direct proportion to mining rewards.  Put another way, if mining produces 1 million in coinbase rewards and transaction fees a day, then energy costs can be calculated as

    1,000,000 - amortized cost of capital - profits = value of energy used

Mining rewards (coinbase rewards) are currently vastly higher than they will be in the future.  The network is bootstrapped with these early rewards, which halve over time.  Eventually, the value of energy used will be in direct proportion to transaction fees.

Another issue is that traditional networks (banks, visa, fiat currency) is far more expensive than many people realize.  It's an industry that employs hundreds of thousands of people globally, with enormous energy expenditure.  I think it's ultimately foolish to compare the two because it's so difficult to estimate with accuracy, but this should not be overlooked.

Finally, there are some fun market dynamics that come out of Bitcoin mining.  Bitcoin can be mined anywhere, and thus take advantage of cheap electricity.  Energy infrastructure is often inelastic; a wind or solar plant has fixed capital and operational costs.  If you have 10MW of demand now, but expect 30MW of demand in 20 years, you build a 30MW plant.  So how do you make up the difference?  You sell electricity for less, and some goes to waste.  Bitcoin provides demand for electricity in these remote areas, making these infrastructure projects pay off more quickly, and thus can incentive green energy projects.  This is absolutely happening in China.  To what degree is very difficult to say, but it's noteworthy that production and demand will never be in perfect alignment.  If Bitcoin can serve as arbitrage, it is very much in line with sustainable energy development.

_______

The other aspect is that any cryptocurrency that is based on proof-of-work is going to have security in *exact* proportion to energy use.  The cost of an attack will always be directly proportional to the value of securing the network, i.e. mining rewards.  It doesn't matter if it's Bitcoin or Ethereum or whatever.  The only way this could change is a proof-of-stake system.  Such a system may be developed, but it is *far* from clear that it can be done.";1;0;False;Sluisifer;dr9g1v9;"Danish Bitcoin billionaire new sponsor of professional Danish ice hockey team.

"Yeah its funny people dismiss how disruptive deflation is to the use of currency whilst exhibiting exactly the behaviors that make deflation terrible for a currency

""bitcoin will never become a widely used currency because its too deflationary, no one is going to want to spend it if it keeps going up in value""

""that's nonsense, just because a currency keeps going up in value doesn't mean people will refuse to spend it, people still need to buy things""

""so are you going to spend your bitcoin then""

""what are you crazy? I'm going to be a millionaire soon, HODL TO THE MOON!""

The ""people still need to buy things"" only works as an explanation if there's no other currency they can use.

Gold coins used to be commonly accepted currency. Supply of gold failed to keep track with demand for currency till eventually it was far more profitable to hoard gold than to use it, and people just used other metals and paper for currency.

People weren't forced to keep using gold as currency because there were less deflationary metals they could still use as coins.

"> Anyway there are still tremendous opportunities ahead! 

Absolutely. I may have missed the ""get rich off of $100,"" but that doesn't mean I can't invest in it still. ETH and LTC have doubled in price this past week and it's not impossible that they'll close the price gap between them and BTC, currently worth .042BTC and .017BTC respectively. Then there's Ripple, which has tripled to $0.80USD in the past week. I need to invest a couple hundred or so in that just in case it shoots up in price. Most of my coins will still be held in BTC since I feel it's still the safest option and is the pioneer coin. 

>This will be a huge industry one day (no right now it isn't and in my opinion we are nearing ""peak inflated expectations"")

I agree. Cryptocurrency is nowhere near what it will be. Although Bitcoin has a special place, I don't believe it can exist as the sole currency of the world due to limited supply and divisibility ([see another comment of mine here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7h6fft/as_of_right_now_the_24hr_high_is_11100usd_and_the/dqovugq/)). Basically BTC market cap would be to small to meet the worlds demand, or one Satoshi would equal more than 1¢. Either way, BTC would have to be supplemented with another currency. 

P.S. While typing this, I had the thought of the US issuing dollar bills that say [""one dollar in Bitcoin payable to the bearer on demand""](https://www.collectons.com//images/items/2013/03/05/1362527682.jpg)";1;0;False;UsernameGoesHere122;dr9cwaw;"Danish Bitcoin billionaire new sponsor of professional Danish ice hockey team.

"> That would make sense if you had a whitepaper clearly outlining how 32 Red would be a superior choice with a clearly favorable risk/reward profile.

Plenty of gamblers say they have a winning system. Some even write them into books. If you ask the winning roulette wheel players what their system is you won't get any better answer than if you ask the losers. The fact they won is not proof they had a winning system. It's just survivor bias. 

The white paper is a bad example of a prediction, since Satoshi intended bitcoin to scale properly and to be used as a peer-to-peer currency, not to fail to scale and become a ~~speculative investment~~ ""store of value"".

The words ""store of value"" don't appear once in the original white paper, neither do ""settlement layer"" or ""second layer solution"". All those things have since come about as explanations for why bitcoin is still valuable and not a speculative bubble even though its failing to do the things Satoshi intended and predicted it would do.

Gold and Bitcoin could both be currencies.

Bitcoin acts as a store of value as you and I said, and if it starts getting used more as a means of exchange, it would be a slow process, but it could eventually start getting used as a unit of account, and from there become a standard of deferred payment. All I'm saying is that if it already acts as one, that could lead to the others.;1;1;False;yourselfiegotleaked;dr97jj6;"Danish Bitcoin billionaire new sponsor of professional Danish ice hockey team.

"**Tulip mania**

Tulip mania, tulipmania, or tulipomania (Dutch names include: tulpenmanie, tulpomanie, tulpenwoede, tulpengekte and bollengekte) was a period in the Dutch Golden Age during which contract prices for some bulbs of the recently introduced and fashionable tulip reached extraordinarily high levels and then dramatically collapsed in February 1637. It is generally considered the first recorded speculative bubble (or economic bubble); although some researchers have noted that the Kipper- und Wipperzeit (literally Tipper and See-saw) episode in 1619–1622, a Europe-wide chain of debasement of the metal content of coins to fund warfare, featured mania-like similarities to a bubble. In many ways, the tulip mania was more of a hitherto unknown socio-economic phenomenon than a significant economic crisis (or financial crisis). And historically, it had no critical influence on the prosperity of the Dutch Republic, the world's leading economic and financial power in the 17th century.

"Bitcoin lost 80% of its value for close to a year after it hit $1200 for the first time. It took several years to get back to $1200. That's a terrible return on investment during those years. You could have sold at $1200, burned half the money, bought back in at $250 and still have made a profit compared to ""hodling"" during that time.

Saying there's never a bad time to buy bitcoin because it tends to go up over time is like saying there's never a bad time to buy a house because house prices have been going up on average for over 100 years.

there was a bad time to buy a house, immediately before the last housing crash. Depending on where you bought your house it might still not have recovered in value, nearly 10 years later.

The fact that eventually the house will probably be worth more than it was in 2006 doesn't mean it was a wise time to buy. Same goes for buying gold right at the peak of the gold bubble. Everyone who bought in at the peak of those bubbles thought it was a sure thing that price was never coming down again, both of them are still down significantly.

Bitcoin also has the issue of consuming massive amounts of energy. With every new Bitcoin added to the market miners need use more processing power to mine the next coin. I've read somewhere that Bitcoin miners consume as much energy as Denmark. Those miners are essential to keeping Bitcoin running. In a society were we are much more conscious of our energy consumption, if crytocurrency becomes mainstream Bitcoin is going to have a hard time competing with alt coins that use more energy efficient ways to maintain the blockchain.;9;5;False;ScipioLongstocking;dr8zk5j;"Danish Bitcoin billionaire new sponsor of professional Danish ice hockey team.

There are new and better tech coming up.  Look into POWR, IOTA, ADA, ARK and some others (like privacy coins PIVX, NAV, etc).  All these have an edge in litecoin in terms of tech and promise and are much cheaper than litecoin for now because litecoin shot up so much recently.  I think 2018 is the year of alt coins.  POWR looks really cool and with the rise of solar and electric cars, it’s going to go huge.;4;1;False;johnyutah;dr8ybpn;"Danish Bitcoin billionaire new sponsor of professional Danish ice hockey team.

"The whole ecosystem has been predicated on Bitcoin actually succeeding from the beginning. I understand what you're getting at here, but it doesn't apply to what I'm saying as it was never that type of situation. Altcoins were like completely irrelevant until maybe late 2013. Even Litecoin was barely notable for a long time. Not only that, but to use Litecoin as an example, the whole concept of Litecoin's success was based upon the assumption that Bitcoin would be successful, or too successful, thus the need for Litecoin(I'm not making this claim, but that's the concept).

It was never a case where Bitcoin was just one of many and happened to be the lucky winner while everything else died off. It was a completely new technology and there was nothing like it.

Certainly not claiming anything about following anyone's advice though. Like I said in the post, a lot of these people are completely wrong about many things. But they were right about Bitcoin and their zealotry paid off big time even if a lot of the times it was completely misguided.";4;1;False;ff6878;dr98y65;"Danish Bitcoin billionaire new sponsor of professional Danish ice hockey team.

"You can sit at a roulette wheel all day and think to yourself ""damn I should have bet the house on 32 Red, I'd be a millionaire now""

Or you can think that you didn't actually know what was going to happen so its stupid to beat yourself up for not taking a risk you had no idea would pay off.

When Bitcoin hit $1200 for the first time it later dropped down to the mid 200s for nearly an entire year. If at some point you needed to spend those bitcoins you would have lost over 80% of what you put in.

you don't hear the stories of people who lost huge amounts of money on bitcoin because people don't tend to brag about their failures.

Back when bitcoin was first being mumbled about and was still a few under a dollar I wrote a paper for school about how bitcoin was going to SKYROCKET to $10 or even $20 because I saw them as a digital currency that could be used for digital items like say you were REALLY good a WOW and had a lot of cool items, you could sell them for Bitcoin and use that to buy items in a completely different game. I had a friend who bought $50 in bitcoin and asked my mother if she could help me buy $20 if my friend shown me how to do it. She said no.

I have two friends who invested early, one bought 2500 for almost nothing and sold it all for $4000 when he wanted a newer car. another had a few hundred and sold them at $10 I believe";2;0;False;suitology;dr8zank;"Danish Bitcoin billionaire new sponsor of professional Danish ice hockey team.

"Unless you were extremely wealthy to begin with, you would have (likely) sold the first time it hit $500...definitely when it hit $1,000. 

Let's say you invested $20,000 back when they were $100 each.

Congrats. You own 200 bitcoins.

Once they hit $1,000 each, they're worth $200,000. Again, unless you are very wealthy, that $200,000 represents paying off school loans, a down payment on a house (paying of a mortgage), and possibly more. 

The odds of an average person holding are slim to none. The only person who can afford to hold those to the end are people who can look at $200,000 in profit and say....""eh, if I lose it, no big deal.""

"The US dollar. The peso. The British pound. The franc. 

What do these all have in common (besides being a currency)?

They are government backed. Which means they don’t need to win over support from the public, since they’d already have it. The government is the one enforcing fiat.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin isn’t backed by any government. Which means, for it to be useful, we need to gather public support. We are already doing this in many ways, and one form of it is advertising. Naming an entire stadium after Bitcoin is just one example of the advertising we are using.

"There's potentially far more lives-saved per dollar available when you account for existential risk. Pretty much, if humanity goes extinct, that isn't just a loss of everyone on earth, it's also a loss of far more future lives that never come into existence. A 5% chance of saving 10^10 lives (earth population) with, oh, 100 million dollars comes out to about 5 lives saved per dollar, or >1000x more effective than givewell charities in expected value.

One of the leading existential risks is AI risk (here's a bit about it http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/05/22/ai-researchers-on-ai-risk/, the basic argument is that the rest of humanity is rushing forward to human-level or stronger AI, and there's a doom-by-default thing going on where almost all goal systems you could program an AI with fail catastrophically when it gets to human-level or higher, and we don't know what sort of goal system would actually lead a stronger-than-human AI to learn and act on human values, and almost nobody is researching it)

It currently seems like the highest-value use of money on earth at the moment, and the donation link for the MIRI winter fundraiser is https://intelligence.org/donate/ .

"My wife has late stage colon cancer. It's been an extremely long fight, approaching 5 years now. But the doctors have recently told us she only has a few months left. It's too bad it often takes a tragedy to bring attention to such charities. I never gave much thought to cancer research when I was younger.

I'm also a big fan of the *V Foundation*. I too found them when I went looking for a foundation that gives 100% to cancer research. And, while I know it's not a lot of money, I use the *V Foundation* as my charity of choice for Humble Bundles. Maybe, for visibility, you could edit this link into your post:

ME/CFS is incredibly underfunded for how many people that it impacts (1-2 million in the US), and how severely it impacts them, preventing about 75% from working. Compared to similar conditions in numbers and severity, it receives at least 20-50 times less funding. So contributing to research for it is pretty worthwhile. ;13;0;False;fondofcurtains;dr7sqpb;I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes!

"Recently learnt about Angelman Syndrome and reading about it is fascinating - unlike similar conditions like autism which we still don't fully understand the cause, Angelman's is caused by a single gene being stuck ""off"" (silenced) and many think the cure is to replace or re-enable it again.

It's fairly exciting as its one of the few developmental disorders which has a real chance of really being cured in the next decade, and as positive research results come in more and more attention is being made to the disorder as it is being seen as a stepping stone to curing more common developmental disorders.";2;0;False;anothergaijin;dr7v47x;I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes!

"I understand where you're coming from, however: wikipedia is a conventional company and of course they're weary of any new stuff coming up. BTC to many people seems like a scam and to many others seems like an investment opportunity; only very few believe that it's actually currency-while it may become more widely used in the future when its price stabilizes, atm it's very hard to price your goods in a currency that fluctuates by 10-20% daily, 100% monthly.

From wiki's point of view, it would be similar to accepting apple stock, or Greek debt bonds, or a collection of rare historic gold coins; while certainly valuable, the value fluctuates and it can be a pain to exchange for dollars, especially if you want to hit the right time. Wikipedia is not exactly fond of HODL, I'm afraid.

So on this note, if you really wanted to support wiki, why not just sell the amount of bitcoin you would donate and donate the dollars to wiki? The same fee-money would be lost by you as by them, and they'd be happy to accept your donation.";2;2;False;FeelPositive;dr7ntkf;I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes!

"I know The Geek Group National Science Institute (http://thegeekgroup.org) would be absolutely THRILLED to receive a donation of any size, ESPECIALLY in Bitcoin.

Founded in 1994, it's was, and is, the original ""makerspace"". They were a makerspace before anyone knew what one was. It's seen it's ups and downs over the years, being shuttled from building to building as they grew and developed. Still holding the title as the world's largest non-profit makerspace, they seek to provide a space where anyone with a sincere and passionate desire to learn can do so, at their own pace, in their own way. Operating on a shoestring budget from day one, TGG has shown time and again that if you are patient, and determined, you can make anything happen on a low budget. The 3 separate live internet TV streams are built with leftover TV station cast offs, and maintained with volunteer labor, and anyone who wants to learn how the equipment works and is used. The worlds largest, public high voltage and high energy labs are likewise built using donations of castoffs, time and love. Other facilities in the building at present are a fully featured vehicle service bay, complete with hoist; a laser lab for experimenting with optics and other such toys; a computer lab for tinkering with computers and software. 

The list goes on, but the common denominator is that all the toys and facilities are available for the average joe to come play with, and learn about. 

But this isn't about just the facility, it's about community too. Situated in the heart of the Grand Rapids, MI ""Westside"" TGG has a heart for the working class people who live around them, and exists to provide them and anyone else a place where they can better themselves. Their Computers for Families program takes cast off, out of warranty computers from offices all over the state, wipes them, refurbishes them, and sells them for a pittance ($50 or less in many cases, just enough to cover costs) or outright gives them away to families all over the area, allowing kids to continue homework at home, parents to do remote schooling, and fill out online paperwork. TGG cares deeply about everyone and want to see everyone succeed, and all their programs are designed around this goal. 

I've been following them from 2011-2012, been a remote member from 2013, been a major donor since 2014, and have been remote staff since the start of 2017.
I am a personal friend of several of the staff and know many others, and the drive to see this company succeed, and to help our fellow mankind become the best versions of themselves they can be is infectious, and apparent in all of us.

It's incredible what we can do with just muscles and drive; I look forwards to the day I can see some real money added to this equasion. 
I really want to stress that it's not about money. We're charging a mere $20/mo for membership ($30 for a family) that has full priviledges when the likes of TechShop were charging $150/mo just to be allowed in the door. We need funding for basic infrastructure, and to pay our hardworking volunteers a respectable wage. We're rated Guidestar Platinum for transparency and accountibility, and we work incredibly heard to maintain that. (https://www.guidestar.org/profile/38-3600686)

To get an idea of what we can do with what we have, check out ""The Geek Group"" on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCM8Y_V0jqqYS6dLwMoRO9FQ)

Please consider this organization in your charitable giving, the impact would be nigh incalculable.

"This post made my day. Very cool!

I'd encourage you to consider the Against Malaria Foundation. It horrifies me to realize there are parents who can't afford a $4 bednet to protect their children from a life-threatening disease. I can't imagine having a child and not being able to keep him or her safe.

Malaria still kills nearly a million children every year, but it is VERY preventable. The Gateses are also working on eradicating malaria because it's such an effective way of improving lives for those worst off. And a lot of governments have partnered with AMF, so your dollars will go twice as far!

According to GiveWell charity evaluators, you can save a life for $3500 with bednets. They also say that the Against Malaria Foundation will fall $50 million short of their funding target just this year. If you made up that gap, you would singlehandedly save the lives of more than 14,000 people - and you'd have 14,000 very grateful families thanking you.

Because selling is a taxable event that triggers capital gains.

"> Maybe MIRI. They just do research to help keep future AI safe. They accept Bitcoin. https://intelligence.org/

This. There's a lot of effort being put into making machines that do what we *tell* them to do, but very little effort put into making machines that do what we *want* them to do.

As AI advances, I think we'll find that the second problem becomes much more important. For example, imagine an AI smart enough to do really well at biomedical research and tasked with reducing the incidence of cancer. It comes up with a bio-molecule that's pretty good at preventing cancer in people, but then it turns out that the molecule also causes those who receive to become allergic to alcohol. The AI had figured out that stopping people from drinking would reduce their risk of cancer, so it forced people to stop.

That specific failure mode was so unexpected that the AI's creators didn't think to address it, but a properly designed AI should respect our preferences, even if we don't think to explicitly tell the AI to respect a given preference. MIRI is working to figure out how to build AIs in such a way that they do what we want, without us having to perfectly convey our desires to them.";23;0;False;caverts;dr7uhgq;I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes!

>""The very wealthy can get more benefit from their charitable aspirations though. My favorite strategy is this:
>
>* Place highly appreciated assets into an Charitable Remainder Trust (CRT). Maybe you own $10m of Bitcoin and you originally paid $25,000.
>
>* You receive a huge tax deduction that can be carried forward. You also avoid paying tax on all the gain those appreciated assets had.
>
>* You receive income from the trust as long as you are alive. This can be setup in a few different ways, but is often 5% of the value of the trust.
>
>* At your death, the remaining assets are given to a charity that you had chosen.
>
>* Funny thing is, you designate a foundation. A foundation that is formed at your death.
>
>* This foundation's purpose is to monetarily support a cause (e.g. a foundation that awards a scholarship annually for low-income students interested in programming).
>
>* Your offspring manage this foundation, drawing salaries (finance, accounting, attorney work etc.). Foundation's are generally required to output 5% of their assets annually to support their cause. These salaries eat into that 5%.
>
>That's a whole lot of benefit. It's kind of fucked up how many crazy opportunities open up when you have a lot of money.""
>
>Now, the main problem that strategy is that the charities don't see benefit until you pass away. Really, you could just give part of your income to charity each year. Or, you could just put 50%/etc. toward the remainder trust instead of the whole thing and the rest could go into your foundation right now. You could then start giving how you want now with the foundation, while receiving income to live off of from the remainder trust which will eventually pay a huge sum to your existing foundation.

"PineappleFund, 
I just signed onto Reddit for the first time today at 11:30 pm and my inbox has blown up with private messages and tags asking me to tell you my story, and about the initiative I founded. Once I started reading this post I got SO STOKED!!! I literally had chills... I was given 5.2 bitcoin by my buddy Joe Rogan and some of his generous podcast community several years back as a sort of science experiment. I think what spurred it all was that Joe had just had Andreas Antonopoulos on the podcast and I was on talking about the cause a few days or weeks later before I left to the eastern Congo rainforest to live for a year... For bitcoin to go from a few thousand dollars to almost six figures is SO INCREDIBLE! The purpose of the BTC donation was to help my foundation make a real & practical impact with the hunter-gatherer Mbuti Pygmy tribe in the rainforest of DRC Congo, my second family. Hearing about BTC exploding last week while I was on the JRE podcast with Joe BLEW MY MIND! I'm blown away by your generosity and how you are living your life to make a difference! AND CREATING THE PINEAPPLE FUND!! 
Here is a quick cliff notes version of who I am and what life I'm so grateful to be living. Someone from reddit made this info meme... http://dailypicdump.com/media/20160629/good-guy-justin-wren.jpg
Also, this community, Reddit, was one of the key components of me starting up Fight for the Forgotten! I'm very thankful for the people who make up this place! A video of me was posted and it became the top post on reddit's homepage for a day. The video was of some of the kids in Congo seeing a dude with white skin for the first time. Jimmy Kimmel showed it that night saying, ""here is Justin Wren, UFC fighter, in Africa being pet like a golden retriever (lol)"" The next day it was on The Today Show, then I was on TMZ for a live interview right after Lindsay Lohan and right before Honey Boo-boo, ha! So I know the power of both Reddit and BTC. (And most of all, COMMUNITY!)  
My name is Justin Wren, I'm a professional MMA fighter, an author, speaker, and founder of the non-profit initiative www.fightfortheforgotten.org that is now under the nonprofit Water4. I founded FFTF after having a rude awakening to the worlds water crisis and modern-day slavery at the same time. I held a 1 & 1/2 year old boy in my hands as his past away, his name was Andibo, and he died of dirty water. As I was digging his grave with blisters on my hands I found out his mother, a slave, was rejected hospital treatment because the hospital wouldn't ""waste their medicine on a Pygmy animal."" The pills were $1 to save his life. It was $3 for the one-shot cure. The entire village tried to give them more than enough but because they were Pygmies they were denied and rejected hospital treatment. It was around $35 for the casket and shovel we buried him with. 
This event changed my life drastically. I've now set out on a mission to defend the weak, love the unloved, and empower the voiceless with a vision of overcoming oppression with overwhelming OPPORTUNITY. The Pygmies told me everyone else calls them the forest people, but they call themselves the forgotten people. That's what I'm now trying to do with my life, Fight for the Forgotten. To live to LOVE, and fight FOR people. The story is better told in person or thru video, but here are some of the things we have accomplished. We have 32 staff in Congo. 20 full time, 12 part-time. They themselves have acquired back 3,000 acres of land for the Mbuti Pygmies, legally. They have drilled over 70 water wells now and started 3 amazing farms. We have replanted over 4,000 trees, and we have seen over 1,500 people literally transition out of modern-day slavery and into sustainable freedom with their own land, water, and food initiatives. We are now currently acquiring more land to start up our own soap production facility and essential oil press so that we can create more jobs, and provide the locals with a safe alternative that is locally sourced instead of the only thing they currently have available, if anything at all, car-washing soap PACKED with toxic chemicals from India or China.  
The nonprofit I partnered with is an amazing non-profit Water4. Last year alone they empowered 44 well drilling businesses in 16 African nations that employed 396 of their fellow countrymen! They are the HEROES of this story! They came together and drilled 690 water wells, JUST LAST YEAR serving over 172,000 of their fellow countrymen. 
Our collective belief is that opportunity is greater than charity. That charity can be great, in specific circumstances, but opportunity is just always better. It's the difference between a one-time handout and a true hand-up. I think the traditional charity model should be reserved and implemented in times of natrual disasters, war, faminine, or people with disabilities, etc... But people facing poverty and problems with a solution need an empowering way out, not a disempowering model that can cripple the community. (check out When Helping Hurts and the documentary Poverty Inc. for quick resources) I learned this by living with the people, listening to them, and learning from them the best way to love them. Help partner with them to create an opportunity. That creates hope, gives energy, and provides a real solution. A Swahili proverb my Mbuti Pygmy family taught me and lived out in front of me is, ""If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together."" Our methodology is all about empowerment! Empowering people with an education, or the knowledge, and equipping them with the tools to solve their own problems locally, and empowering them to carry it out and become SELF-sustaining (not only ""sustainable"" in the western terms) to where they don't become dependent on us, but know they can knockout the water crisis for themselves. 
Here are some quick links of the story that is unfolding. But before I post them, I just want to say thank you for letting me share my story! Also, and more than that, thank you for sharing the incredible OPPORTUNITY you have to empower people to empower people!

"Sooooo the deal with my student loan issues is basically two-pronged.

1) In order for my loans to be discharged due to my health, Canada needs me to be “severely and permanently disabled” — a doctor (if I even had a family doctor, my province has a severe shortage and this adds to my difficulties) needs to certify I’ll never be able to work again. That 10 hours a week I struggle and suffer to work might automatically make it a no-go. 

2) My boyfriend and I are not committing fraud like most people who live together do. I have a friend whose loans were erased because she still says she’s single even though she and her boyfriend have lived together like 5 years, and the government considers you common-law after one year. It’s not that we didn’t want to do what everyone else does, it’s that I got audited and didn’t feel comfortable doing it under those circumstances. So while I’ve been housebound since 2015 and for over a year had zero personal income, the government considered my boyfriend’s income as well and so I had to keep making payments. 

The fact that we couldn’t escape common-law is why I can’t access any disability support whatsoever, because my boyfriend’s income is considered too high, even though he really wouldn’t be able to cover both our bills no matter how hard he tried. 

In a lot of countries, disabled people have to choose between any independence at all or having a partner — Canada is unfortunately one of them.

Also student loans don’t go anywhere when you file bankruptcy here. It’s a shitshow. ";2;0;False;princesscollegefund;dr8mjgt;I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes! Introducing The Pineapple Fund;7jj0oa;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7jj0oa/im_donating_5057_btc_to_charitable_causes/
Your generosity is awesome! One charity I support is the UK [Humane Slaughter Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humane_Slaughter_Association), which does research on less painful methods of killing animals for food. I think their work is especially important in the case of fish, since most fish that humans harvest are asphyxiated to death with no prior stunning. At least 1 trillion fish are killed per year for food (which is more than 100 times the human population), so the potential impact of reductions in the painfulness of fish slaughter is staggering.;6;2;False;Brian_Tomasik;dr9cnz3;I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes!

New Harvest is an organisation that invests in and promotes the creation of clean (i.e. cultured) meat. This is also a very good charitable cause, as currently 60 billion nonhuman animals are slaughtered every year and most are kept in brutal factory farm conditions their entire lives.
New Harvest's aim of bringing to market viable, competitive alternatives to meat could therefore reduce tons of suffering.

"Hi /u/PineappleFund !

I actually don't have a charity to recommend (well I do, but they're filling out an application on their own, and I'm not here to talk about that.)

I want to talk to you about Bitcoin safety. Presumably you haven't gotten this far without thinking about security, but I want to suggest that making grants from a single huge output like this is NOT a good idea, and is potentially dangerous.

Each time you transact, the entire $80 million balance is being moved from one address to another. Every single such move comes with a risk -- not a large one, and not one that would be worth worrying about for a much smaller amount -- of a software bug, hardware failure, cosmic ray, etc. -- rendering the remaining amount lost and unspendable (or not easily spendable.)

Although it's fun and useful to be able to demonstrate ownership of the funds in a single giant output, I think you would be much safer with these funds stored in smaller quantities in separate addresses. I would be happy to provide specific advice on how to do this safely; the easiest procedure would be to make a second wallet and send the funds there in slightly smaller increments, say 500-1000 BTC, such that losing one of them to a software bug would be, although horrifying, at least not the end of the Pineapple Fund. Then you could more safely make your individual donations from the second wallet.

I also hope you are taking due care in storing the funds in general (although I imagine you must at least be using offline storage to have made it this far with so much Bitcoin still in one piece.) On the off chance that you require _any_ advice or consultation on the secure storage or safe handling of Bitcoin, please feel free to reach out. PM here is fine, or gwillen@nerdnet.org , or gwillen@blockstream.com . Anything I can't answer, I have access to people who can, and would not hesitate to help.";8;1;False;gwillen;dr7yjx1;I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes!

"Another completely disabled ME-CFS patient here.
This illness RUINS lives. 

It is the most torturous disease I know about.

Please donate to OMF - https://www.omf.ngo/the-end-mecfs-project/

In 1994, one of the world’s most renowned ME/CFS clinicians, Dr Daniel L Peterson from the US, powerfully expressed the severity of ME: “In my experience, it is one of the most disabling diseases that I care for, far exceeding HIV disease except for the terminal stages” (Introduction to Research and Clinical Conference, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, October 1994; published in JCFS 1995:1:3-4:123-125).

In 1995, Professor Mark Loveless, Head of the AIDS and ME/CFS Clinic at Oregon Health Sciences University said in his Congressional Briefing that an ME/CFS patient:

“feels effectively the same every day as an AIDS patient feels two weeks before death; the only difference is that the symptoms can go on for never-ending decades”.


In 2004, Dr William Reeves, Chief of the ME/CFS research programme at the US Centres for Disease Control, (CDC) reported that ME/CFS patients “are more sick and have greater disability than patients with chronic obstructive lung or cardiac disease, and that psychological factors played no role” (Press Release, AACFS, 7th October 2004).


Also in 2004, a randomised clinical trial found “In comparison with other chronic illnesses such as multiple sclerosis, end-stage renal disease and heart disease, patients with (ME)CFS show markedly higher levels of disability” (Am J Occup Ther 2004:58:35-43).


In 2005, Nancy Klimas, Professor of Medicine, Division of Immunology, University of Miami; Co-Director, E.M. Papper Laboratory of Clinical Immunology; Professor of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Miami, and Director of AIDS Research and Co-Director of the AIDS Clinical Research Unit, Miami VA Medical Centre, said in her American Association for CFS In-coming Presidential Address: “Our patients are terribly ill, misunderstood, and suffer at the hands of a poorly informed medical establishment and society”.


In a Keynote Lecture on 27th May 2007 at the ME Research UK International Conference held at the University of Edinburgh, Nancy Klimas listed the three main categories of diagnostic symptoms as being autonomic, inflammatory and endocrine, all of which indicate serious underlying pathology. Klimas, a world expert in ME/CFS, was one of the authors of “Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Clinical Working Case Definition, Diagnostic and Treatment Protocols” (JCFS 2003:11(1):7-115), which is usually known as “the Canadian Definition”. An Overview of that document (“ME/CFS: A Clinical Case Definition and Guidelines for Medical Practitioners”) states:


“ME/CFS is an acquired organic, pathophysiological, multisystemic illness that occurs in both sporadic and epidemic forms. Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ICD 10 G93.3), which includes CFS, is classified as a neurological disease in the World Health Organization’s International Classification of Diseases (ICD). Chronic fatigue must not be confused with ME/CFS because the “fatigue” of ME/CFS represents pathophysiological exhaustion and is only one of many symptoms. Compelling research evidence of physiological and biochemical abnormalities identifies ME/CFS as a distinct, biological, clinical disorder”

"This answer shows how smart you are. It is hard to find a name that fits so well with an organization. Thanks for what you are doing. 

I do not know about any organization that teaches about making the most useful for your money when you do not have so much. It is hard to know how to save, how to spend and how to find good lending when you do not have education and money.

California Spectrum Care, the non-profit I work for has applied and one of our main focuses is providing services for the higher functioning group of people with autism. You're right. The Current system doesn't really have a place for those that suffer from less severe forms of developmental disabilities. Unfortunately, most other companies cater towards the more severe disabilities, and even the funding in this industry tends to avoid the higher functioning individual. The state doesn't believe that a high functioning person needs 1-to-1 care, so they end up never getting the attention they need to address any deficits they may have. Hopefully, we can help change this attitude. ;2;1;False;Jiggahash;dr7rlm5;I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes!

So when you sell one the price drops until it is sold and when you buy  the price goes up until someone chooses to sell. That's why the price is rising so much more people are buying more than are being sold so the price increases until some one decides to sell. Stocks work the same way. ;1;0;False;IanMalkaviac;dr7o7us;I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes!

First Descents changed my life. Being diagnosed with cancer as a young adult is devastating. You're just figuring out life--getting an education, beginning your career, funding your savings account and 401k, getting your own health insurance, dating, maybe marriage or kiddos--and cancer flips all of them upside down. FD gives you an adventure therapy trip that helps turn the world right side up again. You meet friends that know what you're going through and help you get back outdoors and gain some confidence in new experiences. I went surfing. The ocean didn't care that my one working arm was weak, the ocean didn't care I had cancer, and the ocean wasn't going to be gentle because it felt bad for me. It was amazing to feel like a normal young adult again! My FD friends are there for me 24/7. I'm pretty shy in person, but when it comes to FD, I can't shut up, every young adult with cance needs to know about their programs, to have these experiences. This money can truly make a difference to so many young adults--we can't cure cancer, but we CAN improve the survivorship of so many with $1,000 for one camper, $25,000 for an entire camp.

"Well I guess it will be buried now...

I work in a school in the Mental Health filed in King George County, Virginia, a pretty poor area. There is a huge need for stronger Mental Health and Drug Abuse programs in the area. The High School alone has more than 1300 kids, and there is 1 middle school, and 3 Elementary Schools in the area, and there is no reliable Drug program in the County, and there is ONE Mental Health office, with exactly 2 counselors. For the more than 2000 children in public school, their families, and other members of the community, many of which do not have reliable (or any) transportation to go to the center, let alone the various other centers outside of the County, more than 30 minutes away for most.

In addition, the drug epidemic has been spreading, but it's hitting particularly hard in this area. King George is kind of the West Virginia of Virginia, and Opiates are pervasive. Every week we have one of my students family members die from overdose, and even the children are getting into them. As I left work the other day an ambulance pulled up and it was for a child who overdosed in the school (still haven't heard the result). One of my current clients told me about the time they drug their Father into the cold bathtub as they had done countless times before, except this time he never woke up.

It's everywhere, and everyone knows, and there are people that want to help, but there's no way. There are just no facilities in the area, despite numerous pleas to surrounding cities to build satellite facilities. There is a wealth of workers to stock locations and there is plenty of love and care for the area, but nowhere to put anybody. I've even been suggesting it to my company, and it's somewhere on the list of things to do, but I imagine finances is the big issue, because the company would have to build the entire facility themselves, as no one else is.

I don't know that there is a specific charity in the area that would cover this (I looked over King George's charities), nor do I think I would need more than two hands to count the amount of people in King George who know what a Bitcoin is. But the need is there, and if we can just get some facilities set up, we could really save the minds and lives of adults and children for an entire County and community!";2;0;False;1337haXXor;dr82pm8;I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes!

You could have kept this for yourself and all your friends and family but you chose to do this and it's very admirable. 

As far as charities go, I donate to a few big name ones like Amnesty and Care, however I have heard that there have been some tremendously positive results from small, local level grassroots approaches to teaching vulnerable young children in bad areas everything from basic education to how to treat and help one another. I'm guessing you won't have to work anymore so if ever you want to get directly involved in some of this stuff I highly recommend you consider setting up something similar yourself! 

If it's something you want to do a year or two down the line, I will even take a half year to a year off work (wouldn't have to quit my job) to volunteer/help you set it up.

"Hepatitis had a trivial cure that was discovered by accident. I actually knew the guy that “invented” it. I worked with him a few years back before he passed away. He loved telling the story about its discovery as an example of serendipitous science. They were not looking for a cure. They were not even looking for hepatitis. They were doing blood analysis in the field and data reduction errors from noisy blood analysis. They developed a physical filter to get rid of that noise. Turns out that noise was hepatitis, and the filter sorted out the non active junk. The original hepatitis vaccine was literally as simple as collecting the filter, putting the slime in a needle, and injecting it in someone not showing symptoms. The crud was >99% inactive viral bits and it primed the immune system to deal with the few live virus that came through, as well as any future infection. Oops, accidentally cured hepatitis and won the nobel prize.

Much of the early vaccine cures was the low hanging fruit — viruses that have shapes easy for the immune system to recognize and clean up, or don’t do tricky things like lay dorman in cells or tolerate mutation. While there are a lot of viral diseases with vaccines, you don’t generally see as much research into cures today as you do suppressive antiviral treatments.";2;1;False;maaku7;dr87k0z;I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes!

"OMG What an incredible act of generosity! I would like to ask you to donate 80 Bitcoin to [https://de.serlo.org/](https://de.serlo.org/) I have been lucky to meet the founders a couple of times and I myself are an annual donor for Serlo. The hard voluntary work to educate young children and bring them out of poverty that they have been doing since their beginning in 2009 is by far the most amazing voluntary work that I have seen in Germany over the past years. 

You are probably curious how it would help them and what exactly Serlo is doing to help so many children.

Before I answer that I would ask you to think about what made you so wealthy? 

Of course you might say:  ""*It was bitcoin and my involvement within the bitcoin community/movement*."" Maybe you have been a developer at bitcoin-core or maybe just an early miner or an early investor. Maybe u have been the person buying [two Pizza for Laszlo and receiving 10’000 bitcoin in return](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=137.0). 

Obviously I don’t know what your role was and how you happened to have more than 5k Bitcoin to donate. However I am very confident that I do know the following: 

If you didn’t have a strong educational background and good access to information you would probably not have been involved with bitcoin and would not have been able to create the pineapple fund. 

Boiling that down I hope that you realize: 

**Education changes everything and enables human beings to lead a self-determined life with dignity.**

But even in a highly developed country like Germany (where schools and universities are basically free of charge) we unfortunately must realize that [wealth and access to education is poorly distributed](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/nicolas-berggruen/germany-wealth-distribution_b_5625540.html). Children coming from financially weak families or from families in which the parents do not have a university degree are (not only in Germany) [less likely to achieve a good education themselves](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2853053/). Statistically they are more likely to die at younger ages and will most likely never be able to live a self-determined life in the way as you and I will be able to do. I personally think this is outrageous. 

Over the last 8 years Serlo has tried to fight this injustice by all means. Following [the footprints of Aaron Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz) who not only found the Reddit Website but also [wrote the guerilla open access manifesto](https://archive.org/stream/GuerillaOpenAccessManifesto/Goamjuly2008_djvu.txt). In his manifesto he describes the moral imperative to free all knowledge from copyright protection in order to have our civilization based upon knowledge. 

In my personal opinion serlo already goes one step further than Aaron. Freeing knowledge is obviously a noble goal. But the next logical step is not only to create an encyclopedia or database of freely accessible and openly licensed knowledge like the Wikipedia but to create a platform and community of people that help other people and in particular children to learn from our fortune of freed knowledge and educate themselves. **This is exactly what Serlo does. With an amazing voluntary effort of many students Serlo provides educational content in the form of thousands of articles, exercises, pictures and videos for students of all ages which currently hundreds of thousands of students use every month.** 

After another person on Reddit said [(s)he would donate one Bitcoin every day until Christmas for Charity](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7gpe1q/give_bitcoin_this_christmas_ill_start_with_25/?st=jb6iq28d&sh=08b683aa) and after your post, I - who is a PhD Student in Web Science, watching the cryptocurrency movement for the last 5 years and [created many openly licensed teaching materials](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/User:Renepick) - convinced the people from Serlo to accept donations via bitcoin since this very morning. C.f.: [https://de.serlo.org/spenden](https://de.serlo.org/spenden) (at the very bottom of the page) and I think they are also planning to formally hand in an application on your website. 

Again you can become witness of the terrible injustice in this world. It is my strong educational background and access to knowledge enabling me to ask you for the donation. In that sense I think it is even clearer why Serlo.org is such an important plattform.

Even if you decide against donating to serlo: Thanks a lot for your noble charity. It is amazing to see that people like you who have been lucky to get a fortune of money are willing to share it for a good cause. There are obviously many other institutions around the globe that do work that is as important or as charitable as the work of serlo. In that sense it is even hard for me to suggest Serlo who might then possibly receive BTC from you which others won’t receive. However if you would consider Serlo I am very sure it would help millions of children in Germany and eventually around the globe a lot.

By the Way Serlo is very similar to Khan Academy but does not have big donors. Also it has this touch of Wikipedia and Community editing and auditing the site. Serlo has always been struggling to survive on very small funds even though the site is well known in Germany and [won many awards](https://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Serlo&oldid=169554187#Auszeichnungen). In that sense I am sure they know how to manage money and to spend it extremely effective, efficient and wisely.

"I used to work for a foodbank in British Columbia. Our foodbank was able to give out $6 worth of food for every $1 donated. Only a few years ago it was less than $3. The current head of Food Banks B.C (my old boss) is doing an amazing job at building a fresh food program and stronger infrastructure for the food banks in bc. He would be overwhelmed with any amount of donations. Im very proud of my old foodbank and how much it has grown and how many people it feeds per capita, it's truly astonishing.

"The whole argument for NN is that it ""keeps isps from making 'fast lanes' and tiering the internet!"" If we don't have NN, the isps can tier our service and create unfair fast lanes and slow lanes right?

But NN has been law since 2015, and Verizon removed unlimited data plans and tiered the new plans. All ISPs still have tiered ""business"" plans vs lower prices/lower bandwidth ""retail"" plans. All isps still offer ""family plans"" that give you different data and price rates than individual plans. These are all instances of ""injustice and unfairness"" that NN was supposed to get rid of....... but didn't.

"imo this is a horrible idea. 

You have a once in a lifetime opportunity to change the world. Instead u give away all your power to a bunch of foundations will most likely squander the funds. 

In the system, your BTC will eventually end up back in the hands of the bankers, and thereby increasing their power. That is how poor people remain poor. You don't own the means of production.

I would suggest that you spend some time to read more books and understand the best way to change the world.

"+1 for researching Effective Altruism!

But I think in this case, it may not make sense to assume that the money can translate into lives saved at the same rate as if you were donating a smaller amount of money. ie most organizations are partially limited on money, and partially limited on other factors, so adding more money only helps to a point. This is called a ""funding gap"": while you may be able to save a life per $1000 for the first thousand lives, it might not scale as well above that. So you'll probably end up splitting it up anyway.

Ultimately the important point though is to consider not just ""does this organization look good?"" when going to donate, but to investigate also the question ""what will the actual effects of my money be here?""

(EDIT: clarified ""funding gap"")";24;2;False;MalcolmOcean;dr8p3gt;I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes! Introducing The Pineapple Fund;7jj0oa;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7jj0oa/im_donating_5057_btc_to_charitable_causes/

The BGRF is focused on applying cutting edge advances in AI, machine learning and deep learning to better understanding ageing, discovering new clinical interventions to slow and reverse ageing itself, developing biomarkers of aging, and they have great ageing scientsts on their bboard of directors, including Joeo Pedro de Magalhaes and Alex Zhavoronkov.

"First of all, thank you so much for doing this. You are just awesome.

Second, instead of suggesting a specific charity, I'd encourage you to think about this: since you've decided to do good, wouldn't it be great for you to do *the most good you can* with that money?

"I would be an interesting en devour to create a non-profit trust worthy source to research, investigate, and rate charities use of donor funds. I am hopeful that it would be less of a which hunt and more of a help to streamline efforts so less money is wasted.  An example is food shelters turning to an auctioning system to improve the type of food that different areas around the country need: https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/11/25/457408717/episode-665-the-pickle-problem

To take it a step further, offer (free?) contracting and counseling to improve the charity, finally open sourcing what improvements were done so other charities and business could review the methodologies to improve their systems.

So instead of just straight up blasting money to these places, you could start a trend that improves money use across the board. With the information opensouced/shared your reach can be greater than you alone could reach.

Feel free to PM me, I'd enjoy exploring different less obvious ways to utilize this money in ways that have some great social ROI.

But you can have a direct impact on honeybees and a lasting impact on pollinators.

For $10,000 you can fund 40 new beehives,

For $50000 you can fund 1000 pollinator gardens

For $100000 you can fund 100 acres of permanent pollinator habitat.

Buy a big chunk of land and make it so when you die it gets donated to the government as long as they do a National Park named after you, your dog or whatever you want.

"You are a very good person, thank you for doing this.  
  
  
Charities that work to clean up the environment, in particular waterways, could really use your help. Pesticides are in pretty much every body of water in America and then there's pollution from boats, fracking, garbage and so much more. It's honestly terrifying to think about, but we're not completely screwed yet.  
  
  
[American Rivers](https://www.americanrivers.org/) seem like they do great work and of course there's always the [Nature Conservancy](https://www.nature.org/)

I don't know if you follow MMA at all but there's a guy who fights for Bellator. His name is Justin Wren and he's probably who we should all strive to emulate. He's a phenomenal person with a huge heart.  He started Fight for the Forgotten a foundation that creates wells in the Congo for Pygmys

I do a poor job of explaining so I'll just link the foundations site.  He's extremely humble and this has become his life.  He fights to build more wells and purchase more land for people thousands of miles away.

"The EFF is a good choice, but **please, please, please don't donate to charities!** Charities are nothing but scams created to enrich their already-rich owners and elite donors via tax writeoffs and to whitewash their reputations vis-a-vis the gullible masses.

By donating to so-called “charities” you're only **redistributing wealth to the rich** and furthering corruption on our planet, which is completely against Bitcoin's core principles.

Consider donating instead to projects, developers, organizations, publications and leading individuals in the Bitcoin, peer-to-peer and cryptography space. Many of these people have been working hard for years on pure enthusiasm. They've made Bitcoin what it is today. These are the people who are making a **real difference in the world,** and by helping them **you'd be making a real difference too.**

Recently the community [stepped forward to help Andreas Antonopoulos,](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7i2mra/someone_sent_andreas_37btc_500k/) for example, when it became known that he was in need of financial assistance.

For some good ideas others have mentioned in this post, see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7jj0oa/im_donating_5057_btc_to_charitable_causes/dr8319s/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7jj0oa/im_donating_5057_btc_to_charitable_causes/dr814nv/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7jj0oa/im_donating_5057_btc_to_charitable_causes/dr817ry/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7jj0oa/im_donating_5057_btc_to_charitable_causes/dr7zwjf/) and [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7jj0oa/im_donating_5057_btc_to_charitable_causes/dr7yqbk/)

* Amir Taaki, Bitcoin and freedom activist  
* Everyone involved in developing the Lightning Network, Bitcoin's next scaling solution  
* Open-source wallet projects such as Samourai Wallet and Breadwallet

"Take a look at:
https://www.parsemus.org/projects/vasalgel/

It's a male reversible contraception solution which currently mainly relies on donation because it's too cheap to market (and the female contraception pharma doens't like that).

The gel costs a few dollars to make and can be reversed with a salt solution for less then a dollar.
I think this gel would be a leap forward for helping against unwanted pregnancies and treat the hormone problem at the same time.

Currently they are getting ready for human trials and they have finished testing on baboons.

Altough I congratulate you on the fact that you're donating to charity, I can't hope but to question the charities that you chose, right off the bat you started with universal healthcare, you know, a socialist idea that would require massive centralization of power and the monopoly of healthcare, damaging competition forever, there's also net neutrality, but that one's too controversial for me to even say which side I'm on without getting flooded with downvotes. But seriously, if your main goal with bitcoin was to get money, that's cool, I support it, but I expected someone that had this much btc to at least have the knowledge of the importance of less government control. Your money can do a lot, I'll just leave with some suggestions for charities, you could help the poor in your country, the mentally and phisically disabled, save the frogs foundation is a good one since they're really important to the echosystem and are on the risk of being extinct, that sort of stuff.;1;0;False;inuush;dr8e4tk;I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes!

"I shared this post with a few of my friends who know some non-profit organisations, smaller ones, that fight for animal rights etc. I also send these to a few charities I know and like, as I can not fill in the form for them. So I hope they get in touch with you!

Seeing all the reactions you got in less than 24 hours you must be over your head, checking every application form :P

How will you check though if the money you sent to these charities gets used for the ""right purposes""? As most of us know, collecting millions of $ and sending that to some charities, often does not help at all.

We have annual charities in my country, that is supported by the government (they double the amount raised each time) but that money either gets used for rich fucks or gets lost... Last time it was 7 million EUR.

There was a documentary a while ago, about the earthquake in Haïti in 2010 where millions (probably billions) was sent to help people and help rebuild towns and houses. This was from 2010, nothing has changed. Instead, there is a small area where only rich people are allowed. Resorts, boats, luxury cars...
Haiti is already one of the poorest countries in the world...

After this documentary aired on TV, many so-called charities were asked what happened to the money. There was ofcourse, little to no reaction or consequences...

I happen to work for a really unique nonprofit in California called Kidango, which is one of the largest and most successful children's charities in the state. I work on research and policy issues (for example this year I wrote a bill (now signed by the governor) that reduces expulsion of children from preschool (yes that's actually a thing)), and I'm working with the University of Chicago on an innovative tool/app to learn more about children's progress in school and additional supports they may need to learn. We're widely recognized as a reliable and impactful organization and I'm happy to provide further info if desired, (in addition to the form I just filled out on the site).

"The thing about charitability is that it’s hard to find the perfect balance between priority and preference.😮

For example, a nice old lady has a hundred she’d like to donate and she’s an animal lover. One day two charities went up to her house at the same time asking for donations, one for a sick child in Africa with AIDS due to die in the next week because of a cold and the weakened immune system, and the other to fund a dog’s operation because some kids got their sick kicks by torturing the poor animal beyond recognition in a developed country. 😢 They’d pick the dog almost all of the time.😲

"[Polaris](https://polarisproject.org) and/or the [International Justice Mission](https://www.ijm.org) (IJM)!

Tens of millions of people are in some form of modern day slavery today: https://polarisproject.org/human-trafficking/facts. It's a staggeringly huge problem. Polaris and IJM both provide meaningful help for individual victims, as well as working toward systemic solutions. Please consider donating to them. According to CharityNavigator, 87.5% of all Polaris funds and 79.2% of IJM funds go to the projects and services they provide. IJM has a larger physical international presence, which drives up their staff costs.
[Polaris financial information](https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=12434)
[IJM financial information](https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=5496)

Polaris is matching donations 3x (and IJM is matching 2x) for the rest of 2017, so that's an additional bonus.

Charities like International Justice Mission (IJM) and Polaris that fight against human trafficking and modern-day slavery are great options for the top of your list!

"I am convinced that the most effective way to do good by donating is to support Existential Risk prevention. Roughly, increasing humanity's chances to survive the coming century by even a tiny percentage will be more valuable long-term than any amount of suffering prevented today – even compared to the maximally efficient charity mitigating animal suffering. I have never seen anything refuting this argument.

I endorse [Miri](https://intelligence.org/), because they deal with the highest existential risk and the most underfunded problem there is, have proven to produce high-value research, and have thus for shown to scale fairly well. I myself have donated to Miri several times before, and will continue to give as much money to them as I can, as long as it looks like they do the best work. Also int his field, the [Center for Human Compatible AI](http://humancompatible.ai/) is a second option.

Alternatively, Climate Change and nuclear weapons pose another existential risk, though this is not my area of expertise. The [Future of Life Institute](https://futureoflife.org/) is a great organization focused on X-Risk in general. I think they would give personal advice, too.

For a more extensive argument why I believe AI is the thing to focus on, see https://foundational-research.org/altruists-should-prioritize-artificial-intelligence/.

As to why Miri, see http://effective-altruism.com/ea/14w/2017_ai_risk_literature_review_and_charity/

It's so easy to assume that saving as many human lives as possible is the greatest thing anyone can do. I'd agree that in the ideal world it probably would be. But in our greatly overpopulated real world, where hundreds of millions of people have unlimited number of children, while being barely able to provide for one, and then rely on other people's help (i.e. charity) to help them survive... It just doesn't look right to me. The only reasonable way to reduce suffering, especially in the developing countries where the most of it is taking place, is to educate people about birth control on a global scale. Saving a 100.000 human lives in the developing countries at the moment would only lead to even greater overpopulation and even greater number of people suffering in the long run.

I work with charities, specifically in helping finance them, and literally cleared my schedule tonight to log onto reddit **with the sole purpose of making a post to r/bitcoin to ask them to donate to what I consider the {best and most in-need charity I've ever worked with.](http://www.beingstudio.ca/)** This was meant to be!!  

Please spend a few minutes on some of the artist bios and I guarantee you you'll fall in love like I have, even after feeling dead inside working with finance.  The studio impacts those who it's designed to help even moreso.

I just had the fortune of sitting in on their Annual General Meeting and despite their success in the communities that they nurture, they have 3-4 years left before they can't financially support themselves.  They subsist almost entirely on donation, with artist fees helping as well, but they've kept fees as low as they can to allow access to all families with developmental disabilities regardless of income, with the goal of making it free.  One can hope!

My goal tonight was to write about how much a large donation would help not only Bitcoin but also local charities, and to take the opportunity to inform the public in a local interview, putting our knowledge and goodwiill to use.  Little did I know I'd log on to find a post ASKING me to post this, but you've done just that!!!

They're a registered charity and the donate button should take you directly to their CanadaHelps registered donation page (gives you a tax receipt too).  I've been helping them for free for as long as I can and have donated everything I can outside of my time as well.  Every day that passes I think about what I would be able to do if I had the wealth of some of the high BTC holders, but I do what I can.  I have .3 btc and I talk to people about it every day just like many in this sub - doing god's work!

"I would like to suggest the Brain Recovery Project http://www.brainrecoveryproject.org/

From personal experience... my niece is four-years-old and has a form of cortical dysplasia called Hemimegalencephaly. In short, one side of her brain was developing and growing faster than the other, leaving her in a nearly constant state of seizures. Through lots of pain and drama (to make it short) the only solution was have the left hemisphere of her brain entirely removed before she was 2 years old. She's an entirely different kid now, still has lots of problems from it and spent more of her life in hospital than out, but is as close to a normal 4 year old we could hope for, watches Frozen, tries to sing along, etc. She's still having to relearn how to use the right side of her body, but its amazing to see how she has excelled despite the trauma and she's really smart and artistic.

The brain recovery project helps with children who require brain surgery whether it's to the extreme of my niece or smaller but still very intrusive surgeries, mostly to help with seizures. They have been an unimaginable help to my family and lots of others I know throughout a very difficult, confusing, and scary process and are at the forefront of research as well.

Even if its just a like on the page! Seriously, its appreciated.

Website is currently being worked on and unfortunately on the side of things where funds fall short, good websites are not cheap and I'm no programmer or designer.

But this will continue with or without any donations, but it could definitely help.

This isn't my first project, I'm an ex syndicated radio personality and I've had multiple successes in entertainment.

Major details of the project are not something I can come out in public to speak of, but have sent information in the application.

Currently forming the 501.3c required to solicit and distribute funds on behalf of the homeless, This is also unfortunately not cheap either.

I've already put over 10,000 into the project, and while things will continue with or without help, it will be much much slower and with far less reach without help, resulting in less  of those in need being helped.

"This'll probably get lost in all the completely deserved attention - and I know you said you don't want to start a charity - but just throwing this out there.

How about buying a fuck load of bitcoin mining rigs and donating them to poor villages with little opportunity for economic development. I've been through places in Cambodia and several other places where people are fully prepared to work 18/20 hour days if given the chance, but the chances are few and far between. These places do tend to have electricity and internet access, really really cheap electricity, comparitively.

Whole villages could pull themselves up out of multi-generational poverty and become comparitively wealthy ""bitcoin mining villages"". This also benefits bitcoin by helping to increase minor decentralisation, and spread very very positive bitcoin news around the world to help balance out the FUD.

"It is absolutely admirable to donate to those who are really in need. However it is disappointing to see that in all such cases more often than not, those who have profited from open source technologies, often forget the developers and the contributing communities. I sincerely hope that they do not forget the goose and focus only on the golden eggs. There are so few working on Satoshi Client; the block chain and secondary associated cryptography and many of them at personal costs, especially if they are developing the technology in innovative way. Helping through financial clout to nudge Coinbase to implement Segwit or other innovations that will keep blockchain adaptable to present and future challenges by supporting such causes and the technological breakthroughs would be no less a contribution. 

No doubt the situation has changed a bit, Buterin could in fact raise a huge sum within a short period of time. But I wonder if Finney, Szabo and Dei ever were rewarded for their contributions fairly and of course there are many more.  Helping the decentralized technologies to develop will in fact be greater service, since it will have the potential to make much of the present charity partly redundant; as it has the potential to empower people financially.

"Please consider [Midnight Discovery](https://www.reddit.com/r/MidnightDiscovery/), 501(c)3 an Educational Society for discussing Business, Technology, & Social Organization.

6 Months ago we purchased 0.5 BTC worth of Signage promoting Bitcoin Education. We purchased a 10' x 6' sign, and 2 signs 6' x 2' discussing Bitcoin education sessions, which went on Weekly, Wednesday at 5:30pm, open to the public.

We would GREATLY appreciate a generous donation, and would use the funds to send out a mailer to 10,000 Knoxville Residents discussing Bitcoin (at a cost of $3,000), purchase new signage ($500), purchase T-shirt and other accessories to distribute to contributing members for Bitcoin promotion ($1,000), and use the remainder set up more offices, preferably one overseas to foster international communications. Setting up an office requires around $10,000 initially, for a year of Rent and $5,000 in advertising. The idea is to develop a HUGE network of offices and Bitcoin information exchanges, in multiple languages, across multiple cultures and continents.

Here is a video of our [last meeting](https://youtu.be/bI1a-UT-zyQ?t=12m58s) and our [Meetup Page](https://www.meetup.com/Midnight-Discovery/). We are now developing handouts, power points, and practicing presenting Bitcoin to groups. We have also replaced to fee for food, to sponsor instead internally, and have replaced the 'sacrifice' mechanic to distributing and issuing assignments, so that participants create the next week's teachings.

We share these videos over the internet so that all my benefit from the sessions, and see what it is like to organize a Bitcoin community.

We hope to develop a strong network of Bitcoin communities across the globe. Where as Andreas moves from town to town giving a training sessions over the course of a week or two, our focus is on building sustaining, organically designed, globally structured communities centered in Block Chain Technology, Business Interests, and Social Education.

"[https://www.facebook.com/kolakariola/](https://www.facebook.com/kolakariola/)

Most people have recommended amazing foundations that do a lot of good for humankind. I honestly hope Kola Kariola gets a bit of attention too ( and money). I have never seen a person more committed than this guy to help stray animals from Romania. I don't know what people know about how things are with stray animals in this country, but you would cry and lose hope in all humanity if you saw/heard some stories. The brutality and lack of care these animals are treated with in official animal shelters is something our of horror stories. Well this guy has managed to build a shelter from his own funds and donations for about 400 dogs plus horses, goats, cats and other animals people dump on his doorstep. He drives across the entire country to rescue dogs that are on the brink of death, he once rescued a dog who's paws had been cut off with an axe and left to bleed to death. He gave him prosthetic paws, he's a happy dog now. He also got the media to write about a dog shelter in a smaller town in Romania where the dogs were beat to death instead of given lethal injections or whatever, because the people in charge would steal the money that were supposed to be used to buy lethal injections. So it really breaks me to see that this guy is periodically struggling to provide food or electricity for the 400 dogs he has in his shelter. Given the right amount of money, this guy and his foundation could change how stray animals are treated/are dealt with in Romania.

Firstly, thanks for doing such an awesome thing with your coins :D I have asked my friend to apply on behalf of Suzhou small animals Charity based in China. They do amazing work for animals in a country that has zero animal welfare laws and a lack of education around animal care. They work incredibly hard and have even been going to various company dinners to collect left over meat to help feed the animals. They recently did an appeal because the dogs didn't have beds for the winter :( They intervened a recent dog cull by asking people to shelter any strays they see and help collect them for neutering and rehoming. Its not a large charity so even a small amount would help them immensely. Thanks again for your generosity to all the charities.

"Good day sir. 

There is one organization that I don't think anyone has mentioned. It definitely needs some help from someone like yourself.

It is [**OSTIF**!](https://ostif.org/) (The Open Source Technology Improvement Fund) - https://ostif.org/

I firmly believe we have severely neglected this organization and it's really going to cripple the future if nothing is done. This is an important organization trying to uphold the standard of security as technology continues to advance. They will soon come to play an important backbone organization for an open-source future, privacy, security and freedom for endless possibilities in the current state of affairs in Cyber security and technology. 

**The Open Source Technology Improvement Fund Mission** - https://ostif.org/the-ostif-mission/

The OSTIF is a corporate non-profit organization that connects open-source security projects with much needed funding and logistical support. This core value is driven by public fund-raising and by soliciting donations from corporate and government donors.

**Why the OSTIF is important:**

Now more than ever, the world realizes the need for strong open-source security software. Because of the lack of a profit motive, open-source programs are woefully underfunded and their resources are lacking, despite their central role in the Internet. This leaves crucial Internet infrastructure susceptible to bugs, poor documentation, poor performance, slow release schedules, and even espionage. Raising money through various funding sources allows the OSTIF to fund and support the most critical open-source projects, with the aim of strengthening the Internet for the world.

**How the OSTIF enhances the security of the world:**

We enhance the worlds security software by providing crucial support and resources to major and noteworthy open-source projects. Success involves a 3 point strategy.

**Bug Bounties** – The OSTIF creates bounties that will be paid out to anyone who finds a major security bug in any of our supported projects. These grants incentivize the world to comb through the code of our projects and look for problems, dramatically improving the worlds confidence in the integrity and security of the projects.

**Direct Code Improvements Through Grants** – The OSTIF gives grants to worthy projects in order to facilitate code changes to make improvements or upgrades to existing projects, allowing them to advance in quality, features, or proper documentation of code at a much faster pace.

**Professional Audits** – The OSTIF gives grants to well-known professionals to audit code and look for bugs, back doors, or other errata. This will add another layer of confidence to the integrity and security of the projects.
Education – The OSTIF builds public knowledge about how to use open-source software to protect their digital privacy and secure their data.

Through these avenues the Open Source Technology Improvement Fund improves the critical security infrastructure of the Internet and be a force for strong security and privacy in the world.

About Ostif Staff - https://ostif.org/about-the-ostif-staff/

"Hello!


Posting on behalf of a friend who submitted an entry to the pineapplefund website, but also wanted to provide a snippet of what her Nonprofit does in Civic Education for students. It's an incredible organization and has seen amazing responses from teachers around the states trying to get their kids involved in their communities. She is a director there and this is what she asked I post. Please DM me if you have any questions and she thanks you for the consideration. Its really incredible what you guys are doing, especially in such trying times! :)


Politicraft, Inc. 


The mission of PolitiCraft, Inc. is to transform traditional civics learning by developing students’ social-emotional skills, literacy skills, systems thinking tools, and design learning mindsets, while fostering improved communication, civil discourse and real-world civic engagement both locally and nationally.


After years of research and development we launched our first product, PolitiCraft, last year. PolitiCraft is a non-partisan action civics card game for the high school classroom that is now being played in 40 states across the US. Through game play, students are guided by the cards to craft narratives based upon a student selected civic issue, informing them of the multiple pathways available to achieve real change in their school and community, while fostering greater civic participation nationwide. Our aim is to not only empower students with the knowledge of our political system and how it works, but to also give them a safe space to practice what it would mean to engage in bringing about a change in their community. Your donation would be pivotal in advancing our cause to transform the way civics is taught in schools across the country and would be used in several ways.


First, it would be used to build new versions of our card game. We have gotten so many requests from teachers for versions of the game that could be played in middle and elementary schools. The conversations that our game inspires about the change you want to see in your community and the ideas from the game about how you can make that change are crucial and should be starting at a very early age. We would use the donation to hire curriculum specialists in these levels to tailor the existing game to make it appropriate for these younger ages and produce these new versions. And, as our first product is a ‘base deck’ we want to develop ‘expansion packs’ for all levels that could be subject, location or issue specific that teachers can fold into their existing deck, i.e., “Geography, Economics, World Issues, State Issues”.


Second, our nonprofit has hopes of distributing the game for free to those schools that can’t afford it, to empower those students that are often overlooked by the systems or don’t have access to the same level of materials that those in wealthier districts do. We currently sell our game at cost as we do not want to overburden the teachers that are buying our game out of their own pockets. The donation would also be used to continue to sell at cost (or lower!) while still allowing us to move forward with our mission.


Lastly, we are developing a ‘conversation series’ that utilizes our game to facilitate conversations on difficult subjects that may be going on in a school or community at large. Your donation would help us fund the pilot series that we would then develop into a package that could be distributed to all schools/communities that may need it.


Please check out our website which is full of information about what we do and why we do it. https://www.politicraft.org/


There are great videos that give a good overview of how the game works, including a set of video instructions that’s great to play in the classroom. https://www.politicraft.org/videos


It also contains free classroom resources for teachers including original classroom curriculum and tools to help introduce the game to students. https://www.politicraft.org/resources/

"NoKill Network works with thousands of pet shelters across USA, Canada, UK and Australia. The organization is run entirely by Volunteers.

They help promote small shelters and sanctuaries that have pledged to never kill an animal. Millions of pets are put down by big shelters and their owners across the world when they are unable to find someone to adopt them. 

NoKillNetwork.org is the only such organization. I have been donating and volunteering with them for more than 7 years now. I convinced them to accept Bitcoin as anonymous donation method and one of their volunteer developer sent me an email letting me know they have added Bitcoin as donation method. To donate you can visit their donation page here https://www.nokillnetwork.org/adoption/make_contribution.php they have a button for Bitcoin donations on the left side. It allows you to send donations anonymously. I am sending them 0.01 (all I can afford right now) and will make all future donations via bitcoin. I also encourage that you volunteer with them, they will connect you with a local nokill shelter or you can volunteer with them remotely if you have any technical or marketing skills. Submit the volunteer application and they will let you know how you can help.

Another good organization that is helping these small shelters and sanctuaries is Rescue Groups at rescuegroups.com. They do not accept Bitcoin yet but they confirmed they will implement that soon. If you are willing to donate using other methods, please check out Rescue Groups organization too.

Please upvote for visibility if you care about animals or believe in their mission. Thanks";1;0;False;Burnem83;dr96xzn;I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes! Introducing The Pineapple Fund;7jj0oa;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7jj0oa/im_donating_5057_btc_to_charitable_causes/

"Hello! First I want to thank you for doing such an amazing thing that will impact untold amounts of people.  You really will change lives with charity like this. 

I want to preface this by saying that the following two charities that I will be suggesting literally saved my family. 

 My daughter was born with Down Syndrome with zero indication before the birth.  She was born by emergency c-section due to fluctuating and failing heart readings. When she was born she was transferred to Maine Medical centers, Barbara Bush Children's Hospital in Portland Maine.  She was transferred by a special emergency response team from the BBH who came to our local hospital with an ambulance specifically set up for Neonatal care.  They stabilized her vitals and transported her to the BBH to be admitted. She was hospitalized there for a total of about 3 months. She had two open heart surgeries as well as two more minor feeding tube surgeries over the course of the next couple months.  The doctors and nursing staff there saved my daughters life. The staff was incredible. The care was top of the line.  I could go on and on about how great they are, but I think asking for a donation on their behalf might sum up my feelings of their facility best. The Barbara Bush Children's Hospital is one of only a handful of children's hospitals in New England that is equipped to deal with cancer therapies, major surgeries, and a myriad of other serious children's diseases and ailments. It is the only one in the State of Maine and the closest one for parts of New Hampshire and Vermont.  

Their website is:

https://mainehealth.org/barbara-bush-childrens-hospital

I encourage anyone reading this to check them out!  I really hope this reaches you u/PineappleFund and you look into them.  You would literally be saving children's lives by donating to them.  You will also be saving families, and by extension more lives. 

In addition to the Barbara Bush Children's Hospital I would like to suggest the Ronald McDonald House Charity.  With my daughter being admitted to a hospital some distance from our house we turned to the RMHC to have a place to stay while we were helping our daughter heal. They provide not only a bed and a shower for families of patients, but provide meals as well, all for free. They welcome individuals or entire families to stay, so that they may be closer to their admitted loved ones.  

Most people have probably heard of the Ronald McDonald House Charity because of the donation boxes at a McDonalds drive thru windows but may not know exactly what they provide to families torn apart by illness. and while all that change does help, I saw firsthand the charity scraping by on day to day donations.  They are virtually run by everyday volunteers.  Every little bit helps and again this charity is close to my heart. 

https://www.rmhc.org/

Either way, I want to thank you again for doing something so amazing for other people. There's so much bad in the world today that hearing about something like this warms my heart. Good luck with you philanthropies, and may the universe be kind to you!

"Could you donate even a little bit ($10,000ish) to something fun? It does warm my heart every time I find out that rich people are giving money to good causes, but it's also happened so much that it's almost background noise at this point.

Then Bill Gates gives to something fun and exciting like those lasers cannons that target mosquitoes or that plan to release a bunch of sterile mosquitoes into the wild so that the stupid mosquito virgins waste their stupid mosquito sex on these stupid sterile mosquitoes and whole populations die out from lack of stupid mosquito babies.

Or I'll hear of someone who gave a couple thousand dollars to fund a project to dig a really big hole and then just fill it with cheap nontoxic shiny things and I'll be like ""haha, yeah, that sounds like something I'd do if I had practically unlimited monies. Good on that guy.

This is so inspiring! This ecosystem needs more discussions on 'positive impact and greater good'. My co-founder @griffgreen mentioned Giveth.io, that's is what we are  about, empowering anyone who want to go out there and make a difference. Aside from Giveth, the Blockchain4humanity program and award is channeling sponsorship funds from the Latin America Blockchain Conference participants (LaBitConf.com) to startups in the space who are using blockchain to improve quality of life and environment for developing nations.

"I send in a form. I really, really like what this fund is doing but I believe being closer to each other is sometimes the key for positivity and helping each other. Hear me out what I have send: 



Organisations are nice, yet also taking up cash. They are helping a particular group of people or some other ""goal"" 

Now I'm just here speaking for myself. Even though I'm not rich, I'm doing 'ok'. There are a shitload of people in the world who could benefit from a little amount of cash. Ive been there too. Hell, I'm -700$ negative on my bank account as we speak. 

Nonetheless there are people who need food support, elder people who worked their entire lives having hardly anything to spend. I strongly believe that talking to individual people can do so much more for this world. 

If I was a millionaire I wouldn't donate to charity. I would sit at the grocery store the whole day. Spotting that one person who is having a bloody hard day and/or live and helping him/her out. 

I believe if we help each other out, those people will give back. Resulting in a positive flow for everyone in the end.

The feeling of giving someone a steak, when he had only bread for 2 months is greater than a 'big organisation' spending 500.000$ on 'research' for some technical stuff. I'm a tech guy myself and even I say this. For example OpenBSD, like posted on Reddit, should be funded by tech guys like myself who use it and even make a fairly decent living out of it. 

Help those in actual need. We are often mistaken that those people are living far away. Good chance is that your own neighbour is having an enormous hard time. 

I hope you appreciate my honesty and my message. Maybe we all can take a moment to look around when we are walking from our work to our home. Look at people, talk to them.

"Fantastic idea.

Maybe make smaller donations to more charities. Take your time, make careful decisions. So far you've picked an interesting and eclectic group of recipients.

Many funds specialise, and only accept applications from specific types of organisations, or for specific types of project. They might have several different things that interest them. This keeps the number of applications from getting overwhelming.

Also, they often have criteria for the size or income of the charity, or have other factors to weed out organisations that in their opinion wouldn't need the grant or don't have the capacity to use it effectively.

Before donating, check their annual report to find out how much income they have. Some big name charities have way too much already whilst others doing good work struggle to exist, let alone grow. But on the other hand, the bigger charities may have the capacity to use funding more effectively, so you need to discriminate carefully.

I work with a small charity called the Ectopic Pregnancy Trust. It's a medical condition that affects 1 in 80 pregnancies, they lose the baby, and it can be fatal for the woman if not spotted quickly. Future fertility is often affected, so there's a mix of medical and emotional needs that we address. They're the only effective charity in the world for this common condition. They provide urgent medical advice to women, and training materials for health professionals. They want to promote more research into the condition. It's their 20th anniversary this year, so they're well grounded but need funds to expand.

Is that the sort of organisation that might interest you? I'd like to apply, will check out your form.";1;0;False;jasonking;dr8i8g7;I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes!

"Greetings. Your post has reached the attention of a Dutch news page. I just had to give it a try, perhaps you can offer help or advice. My Fiancee, 31, has a condition that happens to 1 in 100.000 women which means she was born withouta  uterus. She is unable to have children on her own. When she was 16 and first visited the doctor she felt destroyed and incredibly weak. We have a stable and loving relationship. I knew from the beginning that she has this condition and i chose to stay with her. I know that maybe the future will be without children and i am OK with it, but it's our dream to some day have our own children through a uterine transplant. This procedure however is unaffordable for most people. Help and/or advice is desperately needed. I love this woman and i am powerless to do anything.
