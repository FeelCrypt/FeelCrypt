"Who's to say?  Think about these supply demand factors...

Over 70% of the bitcoin has already been mined.

A decent portion of that has been lost forever.

Everyday only 800 new bitcoin come into existence and that will be cut in half in a few years.

The final < 30% of the bitcoin supply will be mined over the next 120 years!

How many more bitcoin are yet to be lost forever?

Less than 1/10 of 1% of the world population is in.  The big players aren't in yet except for a tiny minority.  

If the demand doubles what happens to the price?  Depends on how bad those people want it and how reluctant the holders are to selling.

What can demand realistically do over the next 20 years?

If BTC is still going strong in 20 years I think it will be exponentially more than it is.

What can kill or severely harm it?  

Another MUCH better crypto, BTC has first mover advantage.


A cataclysmic event affecting the entire world.

Ultimately, down to the level of about 100 to 1000 satoshis is where the real game is. We're going to turn bitcoin into petabyte sized global database to store what really matters. Not trivial stuff like spending bitcoin to buy stuff.

Deep down I at least am trying to turn bitcoin into an uncensorable time stamp database. We'll use it to store records of who owns what.

You know, not everyone has the same goals. :) Just consider me to be along for the ride! Other people with other goals are welcome here too and I welcome them, and it's off to the races. We can fork the coin when needs are incompatible. We can't see the future, so who knows.

"I disagree, if you want actual mass adoption you need something absolutely bulletproof and trustworthy or adoption will never be possible. Bitcoin has a much smaller attack surface and much more conservative development than everything else.

You can talk about sharding and tangles and shit but the more complex it is, the more likely it has a issue.

Bitcoin is comparatively simple and stable and that's what will bring the masses in and I all the LN demos I've seen look about as easy as using bitcoin now. ";2;0;False;VladamirK;dr4sgnl;Working Hard or Hardly Working?;7j584c;https://i.redd.it/c2o6204tvc301.jpg
