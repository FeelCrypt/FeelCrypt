"Peer to peer lending is a viable alternative to centralized banks. The only reason you don't hear much about it ATM is because institutional investors drowned the market before it caught on in the mainstream (read: peer to peer works really well, but you are such an insignificant peer that you'll drown in an ocean of whale spit).

There have been quite a few platforms that earned people a lot of money before the whales noticed and snapped up all the best opportunities. I think one was called Lending Club IIRC, and it worked by dicing up big loans into $25 pieces and letting investors buy and sell them something like a bond. Included was a credit analysis based on FICO, but if we're imagining a world where banks are dead FICO's probably out. I can see a lot of ways smart contracts and tokens can replace FICO/credit history though, so instead of the murky blackbox that is the myriad ways FICO gets calculated, one might rely on the blockchain in a clear, easily verifiable manner (that doesn't cost $60 to peek at!).

Thing is, sure I don't have $400,000 to loan out, but some people do, and it wouldn't be much of a risk. Break it into pieces and sell them to mom and pop immediately (well before the usual default period) and suddenly your risk is minimal.

Really, the problem is unscrupulous people offering really crappy (subprime) initial loans and hawking them off on mom and pop who really have no business assessing the integrity of a specific loan application.";1;0;False;etasyde;drxpfu5;2018: lets run for office;7lo56s;https://i.redd.it/oy1bmxd0on501.jpg
"Theoretically it shouldn't be too hard to script something to turn the smart contract into something more human readable (this already exists). After that, existing infrastructure can take over - and by that, I mean courts and law enforcement not necessarily banks. IANAL but AFAIK Courts of law are agnostic to the currency involved in contracts. The only snag is whether smart contracts are legally binding, which any government can flat out say they aren't.

You can avoid wage garnishment now using the same techniques that apply against cryptos, so that's really not a unique problem here and clearly the infrastructure still works. If you're getting paid under the table, your employer is breaking the law regardless of whether it's Crypto or Fiat. If you're not, and the government wants a piece of that for whatever (hopefully legal) reason, then it will go after the employer for garnishment, not hope you send all your money to a convenient address.";1;0;False;etasyde;drxownb;2018: lets run for office;7lo56s;https://i.redd.it/oy1bmxd0on501.jpg

I'm in a similar boat but sold 80btc so not quite to this extreme.. The truth is if we had the same amount of stomach as we had brains we would have held the lot and still not sold today..

Hi I passed your information onto a small charity in the UK called Breathe for Cameron. I'm not sure if they managed to put the application in on time but they are worth looking into. They are doing some really good work and they are very small in comparison to some. I suffer with asthma and follow this charity I love what they are doing in schools to support children;1;0;False;Blank_-_Page;drxhwrc;I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes!

I sat on this for a bit, thinking for a response. And you know what... I got one. Come to Milwaukee. Seriously. Live on the streets, RIGHT NOW. Tell me that it's better than being in a shelter. Right now it's 0 degrees. Renting organizations are on a back log as we speak on this state. We rarely open up any rental assistance. Shelters aren't meant to be a place that is fucking awesome. Its a place to be in the shelter from the warmth. I'll take that any day than freezing to death. Edit: beggars can't be choosers. I know u didn't pick this life, but u sure as hell can't tell me u would choose to freeze. ;1;1;False;mrbearbear;drxuebd;I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes!

"Um, what?  What are you talking about?  Who ever said that shelters are not better than being forced to be outside?  That's silly.

What I did say is:

> As a homeless women, I actually don't advocate donating to shelters. They are almost universally horrible or at least bad, in all kinds of ways. And they will mostly waste the money. 

> Instead, give to organizations that give people free rent, or very low rent, unconditionally, in healthy, collaborative spaces, so that the residents can heal and be productive in whatever way that makes sense for them.

We are comparing shelters vs. actually effective organizations.  No one ever mentioned comparing shelters to being forced to be outside.

Giving to the places that actually aim to stop homelessness is far, far, far more productive than giving to places that keep people homeless.  It's just basic logic.  If you actually want to solve the problem, that is.

A lot of people don't, though.  A lot of people actually like there to be homeless folks, stuck in shelters.  I never imagined that would be the case, but having been in and around many of these organizations and people, I've found that many of them like the status quo, not just because they rely on it for their jobs/money, but also because it means less work for them, and that lame work can still make them feel ""good"" about themselves.  I've heard so many of the people who are employed at shelters and their related organizations effectively say ""You should be glad I came in today.  Otherwise you wouldn't be able to do anything.""  As if we were pathetic invalids who needed their protection.

As soon as I come in and actually want to solve the problem, most of these folks get freaked out and try to ignore or dismiss me, or worse.";1;0;False;Turil;dryau7w;I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes!

"Hello,
I think what you are doing is amazing!

I have been sick with ME/ Chronic Fatigue Syndrome for years now, and I hope you could make a donation to the Open Medicine Foundation.
Chronic Fatigue Syndrome may seem like a controversial issue, but in fact patients are being neglected severely by doctors and the government. Because ME/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome is an 'invisible illness' and there is no reliable biomarker to diagnose it yet, doctors tell you that you are crazy and don't believe your symptoms. From an outsider's perspective this can seem like a controversial issue, for someone who has ME/CFS it is a horrible situation to be in.

This is a youtube video from the 'Millions Missing ME/CFS Protest' in Seattle and it shows some personal stories from people with ME/CFS, I found the part at 3.44 very touching. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYX3NjJ7OAU
This can make clear that so many lives are impacted by ME/CFS and people suffer horribly, often without any public awareness.

I think what you are doing is amazing, and with the power of money comes responsibility, as Spiderman said. I know ME/CFS in not a simple, undisputed issue in the public, but you could make an enormous difference for so many people with your donation. 

ME/CFS is horribly underfunded and your donation would make a huge difference.

Sending love and many thanks for the good deeds you are doing,
