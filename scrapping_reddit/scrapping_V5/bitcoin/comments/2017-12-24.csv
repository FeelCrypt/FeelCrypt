"First to market is a massive advantage as you can see.

2. It is not centralised, no spokesperson can give a bad interview, no CEO can lead Bitcoin in a certain direction. Humans inevitably make mistakes. By having a community you minimise such risks, similar to why a company has a board.

3. The coins are far more distributed, although around 1000 people own 40%, that is far more distributed and less controlled by the big boys than Bitcoin Cash and other coins.

4. The Bitcoin community focus on security and decentralisation, over fast/cheap transactions. This makes it more suitable as a long term store of value, that doesn't have an upkeep (digital gold), hopefully lower volatility in the future and one that the people trust because of its proven track record. 

Lets see how Bcash scales, but just 1 month ago the number of transactions were lower than those of Dogecoin. If it can live up to its scalability claims is another question.

"Anyone can make typos. And not everyone does well at grammar. Being weak at grammar doesn't make you weak at evaluating technical patterns, nor does your ability to outline an argument properly with perfect use of the English language on an online forum have any relevance in technical chart pattern recognition, let alone any other descussion other then grammar usage discussions.

**But nice red herring.**
--

Furthermore, if you base the validity of an argument on grammatical errors that don't make any impact to the actual substance of the argument, instead of the actual argument itself, you are being illogical. Take some time to understand how to actually logically evaluate a claim as well as getting yourself familiar with pattern recognition in technical trading. Come back to me when you can counter my claim with something that actually has weight to it instead of a pointless retort on word usage.

Just for reference, in the hours since my first post, bitcoin peaked at  about $15,000 on December 23rd before beginning to slide back down. On 24th Dec (today) its at just under $13,000 with a general downward trend. If you can recall, I clearly stated the right shoulder should peak at about $15,000 to $16,000 before another downward slide occurs. I even suggested that people sell between those price points if they are in bitcoin to protect themselves from the next downward slide. A sale at this point would have successfully protected against a 14-15 % capital loss. And thus, was a successful prediction.

Full confirmation of the pattern will occur when the slide reaches the neckline of the pattern again. Given that its a descending neckline, I would say that this point lies between 12,000 to 11,000. Possibly even as low as 10,000 given the steepness of the neckline, but that's a bit of a stretch.

 I'm going to put my guess on 12,500. If I had a long position on bitcoin at this current point in time, I would sell should the price go below 12,500 to protect capital. Obviously a successful prediction would mean this proposed sale at that proposed point would shield the seller from sizable capital loss.

But I probably used a word wrong somewhere or accidently used a homophone incorrectly so apparently my argument and analysis is completely invalid, even if its already being shown to be correct. *eyeroll*

"> This means nothing if the government decides they want your gold and can seize it at will.

Government can seize your bitcoin (they've already seized hundreds of millions in bitcoin), so this can't be the core point either.

""not if I hide it"", well you can hide gold as well. That doesn't make it any more useful. If you want to interface with legal markets you have to report your income and holdings. As you should for both practical, moral and legal reasons.

This is also straying from the ""store of value"" arguments. if you want an anonymous currency then there is nothing better than cash. A blockchain that keeps a perfect record of every transaction which will one day be decrypted, that requires interface with exchanges which keep records and has to ask for identification, is not.

The government is a lot more likely to try and seize something like bitcoin than gold. Gold is firmly established and regulated all over the world. Governments still hold a lot of their wealth in gold, they do not want to disrupt the gold market. Bitcoin is new and its use cases are mainly illegal, there is no underlying economy based on bitcoin that the government has to worry about disrupting. Without exchanges the current bitcoin economy would collapse and it would be trivially easy for them to shut down exchanges if they wanted to.

If you're worried about government then there are multiple other failure points that exist in bitcoin:

During times of crisis government often suspends internet use (including satellite internet). This will make bitcoin unusable.

Even if your government doesn't ban or crack down on bitcoin, a foreign government might, and due to the centralization of bitcoin mining, if China shuts down every bitcoin mine in its territory could easily cause a crisis in confidence which tanks the value of bitcoin.

Government can legally hack your computer and monitor your internet use. They have already compromised things like Tor.

If there's a societal collapse, the power grid will fail and so will the telecoms network, there'll be no way to operate the blockchain and bitcoin becomes no different to any other encrypted number. Even if we got blown back to the stone age gold would still be valuable (since gold was valuable in the stone age).

"You seem to have basic misunderstanding about stocks: 

Let's say you have a growing company, your dad isn't Donald Trump but you really need a new factory to keep growing. What do you do? You put yourself on the market and sell 50% of your company in stocks in order to get capital from shareholders. Shareholders now have a stake in your company, they vote in board members to run the company and are entitled to dividends if you pay them. As the company becomes more valuable the value of stocks rise, sometimes the shareholders benefit more from money being put into the company instead of receiving dividends. For example Apple pays quarterly dividends to all shareholders, the more you own, the more you get. Sone companies decide to invest that money into RND or infrastructure. 


That's some basics of stocks. Sure, P/E ratios are fucked right now but it's been a bull market due to government intervention, we are overdue for a dip in stock prices. But stocks are backed by actual companies, unlike bitcoin, which is entirely based on belief.

Apple stock can not go to 0 without the actual company losing value, bitcoin can go very close without anything fundamentally changing about bitcoin. 

Let's say I copy the open sourse software of bitcoin, so they are basically the same thing, my shitcoin and bitcoin.

"**Scalability**

Scalability is the capability of a system, network, or process to handle a growing amount of work, or its potential to be enlarged to accommodate that growth. For example, a system is considered scalable if it is capable of increasing its total output under an increased load when resources (typically hardware) are added. An analogous meaning is implied when the word is used in an economic context, where a company's scalability implies that the underlying business model offers the potential for economic growth within the company.

Scalability, as a property of systems, is generally difficult to define and in any particular case it is necessary to define the specific requirements for scalability on those dimensions that are deemed important.

Wrong. The gold standard was adopted at the end of the 19th century, the dollar had been in existence for a century prior to the gold standard.

The question is why does the mexican Peso exist when they could use dollars instead? The reason is that it started as a currency pegged to the dollar. This gave it value. But when they let it float, it lead to hyper-devaluation. They then pegged the new peso to the old peso and the devaluation has continued. There is momentum in an assets price, it can't disappear overnight with millions of people holding on to them. Its price will continue to devalue until they switch to a better currency. Mark my words, that currency will be a cryptocurrency.

The dollar started the same way. It was pegged to a weight of gold. When it was left to float on the market, it has steadily devalued relative to gold. Pegging is how national currencies are created. Peg to something with actual value, then let it float and watch it devalue. Then start the cycle over again. 

Pray tell, why do you think the mexican peso and dollar exist side by side? Is it because government ""gives it value""? How would a government do that?

The people are the reason. People's belief in a currency gives it value. People tend to believe in a currency when they believe in its monetary policies.

>Edit: your comment itself answers your first question

Exactly, as in any market *what someone will pay for it sets the value*. 

Only in the crypto market, especially considering the fact that out of my six friends who own crypto **not one hold their own private keys**, there is literally nothing *behind the crypto* whereas with a commodity there is an item theoretically of some consumer/industrial value and with a stock you have a company that *hopefully makes money*. 

What do you have with crypto? 

> total supply vs current market cap.

Irrelevant when you can fork the code and create the next coin. It's all about *what people believe*. 

The HODL'ers help solidify the market and then there are folks like me *who want an actual cryptocurrency* and even more who are looking for a get rich quick scheme.

So if someone is ""shitting on crypto"" make sure that you spend enough time listening to their arguments so that you can determine if they are churning FUD, full of shit, or providing you *honest advice based on their experience*. 

If you're under 40, it's likely that you haven't been *bit by a bubble*.

If you're under 30, it's likely you don't even *remember what a bubble looks like*.

Bitcoin today is still the reserve currency. You can scream and yell about it all you want, but the whole industry was created from what they did. All other digital currencies are “pegged” to it.

You underestimate how entrenched bitcoin is at this point. What other coin, that’s decentralized could take its place right now?

 Fees are high so people moving small amounts will have issues.

For the committed users of bitcoin, it’s a rounding error. We don’t move bitcoin all that often.

"Your response to my point that deflationary currencies like gold stop getting used because the incentive is to hoard them not spend them was to say ""let me know if you need me to explain how bitcoin and lightning work"".

Except neither actually work as a currency, so it doesn't dispute my point. Even bitcoins most ardent supporters have given up saying bitcoin is a usable currency and now say ""its a store of value"" that will one day maybe be a currency (or maybe not, some people say bitcoin is meant to be an asset and other coins will be currencies). Some people say that Lightning will solve everything and make bitcoin usable, except Lightning doesn't work as anything more than a tech demo so you can't say it ""works"".

It works in theory, bitcoin was meant to work as a P2P currency in theory. 

There are lots of software projects that took years to develop and had tech demos that failed completely. The fact its taken a long time is not proof it will work. Even if it does work it doesn't stop bitcoin being hyper-deflationary, so it doesn't change the incentive to hoard instead of spend.
