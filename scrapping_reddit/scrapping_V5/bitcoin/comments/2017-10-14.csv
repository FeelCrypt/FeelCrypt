"Your feeling is very possibly false. If your computer is compromised with a key logger, you could lose your Bitcoin. Someone posted a thread here who had that happen just the other day, and there are other attacks as well, this is just one example. Also, if there is any way to connect your online presence eventually back to you, attackers could specifically target you. This would be more likely for either known whales or people who sometimes come on here and note how much they have, but worth keeping in mind.

Even if you're very safe, you'd want to weigh the risk to the cost. If you have only small Bitcoin to try it out, it isn't a big risk.

"1. It was a radical innovation in the sense of how all of those pieces were put together to form the first scarce decentralized immutable digital commodity.  

2. All value is subjective. Bitcoin serves a purpose as digitil money which is scarce and not issued by a government. People value that. The fact that there is risk of losing it or it being hacked is completely irrelevant. It's like arguing that gold, which has remained valuable for millennia, isn't valuable because it can be lost or stolen.    
The vast amounts of energy are needed to ensure the security and discovery of bitcoins. Without that energy usage (ie. work) bitcoins wouldn't be secure, counterfeit-proof or scarce.  

3. Put your tin foil hat away. You're postulating some grand conspiracy where all the exchanges across the globe, not to mention peer to peer markets like LocalBitcoin, are colluding to hide true price discovery. Any price mismatch with the real market price would be arbitraged away by traders.   
In addition, all fiat currencies can be and are priced in other currencies. That's what the whole FOREX market is; speculation! Sure BTC is more volatile but that's only because its size is minute compared to government currencies. Volatility has and will continue to decrease over time as BTC grows.  

4. Bitcoin is NOT an Ponzi by definition. Ponzi's promise guaranteed returns, are opaque, and are tightly controlled by a conman. When a Ponzi bubble bursts the Ponzi ends with a value of 0 never to recover. Bitcoin has had multiple bubbles, bursts and recoveries in its history yet has gained in value.

"Depends on your definition of ""naturally"".

The coins are mined - that is, people who have invested a lot in computing power and electricity are doing work that produces new coins.  They don't get to choose how many coins or when they get them, that is up to the algorithm that everyone mutually agrees on (if they tried to change this, it just wouldn't be bitcoin anymore and their fake coins would be rejected by the network).

Bitcoins are indeed limited to 21 million BTC.  More precisely, it's actually 21 million billion satoshi, since that's the only 'real' unit understood by the system.  1 Bitcoin - as one hundred million satoshi - is just a convenient amount that once upon a time made sense for dealing with practical sized numbers but is starting to do so less and less each day (personally, I have all of my clients and apps set to mBTC but may consider switching to µBTC once the value roughly doubles from what it is now).";1;0;False;dalebewan;docu9bj;Bitcoin breaks $5500, less than one day after it broke $5000.;761ri4;https://i.redd.it/f2p8tajk9irz.gif

"I wanted to chime in and say that it's like stock trading. Kings have been made beggars, beggars have been made kings. Everyone wants to be a successful trader. Not everyone gets to be.

Look, we might see the price drop back below $5000, and that might discourage people buying right now... but its the natural volatility of this generally new type of asset. And I think that those $200 you have might be enough for a nice return. You just have to be patient, and be wise. 

I applaud that you took a dive into it. Now you're asking very understandable questions when it comes to return on investment and in all reality... nobody knows.

Two, because I am confident in my perspective and I trust myself to recognize when its wise to sell and when its wise to buy.

"What I mean by trading is buying and selling, such that you sell at a high price to buy back at a lower price. Increasing ether the amount of USD that you have, or the BTC that you have. When it comes to a trading strategy, there's no such thing as ""too simple"", there's only ""it works"" and ""it doesnt work"".

Now, what you're proposing is what I like to call a ""holders' strategy"". Which, historically speaking... **it works**. I'm doing some quick math here, but if you had started the first week of 2014, you'd currently be holding 6.04 bitcoin, possibly more (I did 1200/900+1200/400+1200/800+1050/5000, that gives me a conservative estimate of how many bitcoin you would have purchased by now). That would be a $32,030 payday for a $4650 investment over three years and ten months. But keep in mind that you would have been in the red for most of that, you would have broken even sometime 2016. Holding works, but people tend not to like the waiting. And its not the most efficient strategy. **In summary**, I believe it is the safest strategy, but it's long-term in nature (you can spend up to two years in the red) and it's efficiency is medium. If you're OK just letting your bitcoin essentially sit there for years on end, I would recommend just buying at whatever price it is, every 2 weeks. *An essential part of any strategy is consistency*.

What I do... I like to call it ""brute force"" trading. I use margin trading, and I trade a swap... which complicates the explanation a bit... but long story short, I have a set amount that I buy or sell every 2%-3% (it was every $100 when it was below $5000, now it's every $200). So, for example, I sold $30 worth of bitcoin when the price hit $5800, and I bought $30 worth of bitcoin when the price hit $5600, and the sell order for $30 at $5800 is back up. If the price gets below $4500, my buy orders will be bigger than my sell orders, if the price is over $6000, my sell orders will be bigger than my buy orders. Fairly simple, not much though or consideration needed, that's why I call it a ""brute force"" approach to trading.

If you want to get started in trading, you probably can right now. Bitfinex is a pretty good exchange for a quick sign-up for trading bitcoin.

"This is great info and much appreciated. So I started out using coin base. I’m working on getting something like Electrum wallet set up so that I can store my coins and move them around when I want. How would you say that Coinbase works as far as buying and selling in the dips and rises goes? Interface seems simple enough so I like it. 
Or should I check out bitfenix instead? Can I set up buy and sell rules?
Also, probably a dumb question, but I imagine I can easily send funds back and forth from my Coinbase address to the bitfenix address and vice versa?";1;1;False;Rancel21342;docx2an;Bitcoin breaks $5500, less than one day after it broke $5000.;761ri4;https://i.redd.it/f2p8tajk9irz.gif
"Huge risks?

The only risk based on any zoomed out perspective of the charts is that if you spend the 'new money', you're spending way too much of its future value.

You need to change your paradigm for this. Its a technological and financial revolution literally unfolding before your very eyes, much bigger in terms of direct financial impact than the internet. And you are choosing to ignore it.

I don't know.  At some point it will level off.  It might be crazy high, 1 or two million per Bitcoin, but it will level off.

"I’m actually interested in what you mean by trading?
I have a healthy 401k that I understand fairly well. That I have decided will not be touched as part of this experiment/venture. 
I am considering putting $50 every two weeks I get paid into more BTC, because again, what the hell. I waste $25 a week on far more frivolous shit. But is that too simple a strategy? Should I be looking for dips before I buy? Or if I am considering leaving it in long term does it not matter. Should I be trying to sell high and then rebuy low if a large drop appears to be happening? Is it usually obvious, or slow enough that I have time to react?
At this point, at the rate I would be buying I know I’ll never be a millionaire. But figure if I toss a few bucks in here and there, and keep an eye on things, maybe some day in a few years, or hell even a decade, maybe I can pay of my house haha";1;2;False;Rancel21342;docdw9p;Bitcoin breaks $5500, less than one day after it broke $5000.;761ri4;https://i.redd.it/f2p8tajk9irz.gif
"They don't. Plenty of .coms which did exactly what hugely succesful .coms today do, went bust during the crash. Many others which didn't  have a viable product at the time, changed their strategy, and are now goliaths.

You can say the projects which survive will be a subset of the projects which work. but most which work will be replaced, or sabotaged, or simple fail due to any number of unknowns.
