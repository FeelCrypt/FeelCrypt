"You've no idea what you're talking about. (starting with you're style of argument)

Where am I backtracking?

>Imagine if everyone sold their crypto today, 400 billion will never be extracted from this market. That mtgox custodian guy sold 0.2% of all coins and crashed the market 70%, total money extracted was less than $20million.

But everyone will not sell all their crypto in one go so it's a silly hypothesis. Anyway coins can be auctioned or sold face to face without anyone knowing and not affect the market.

Right, I'm sure they are not worried about crypto. Just as the music industry wasn't worried about Napster and Pirate Bay. They are fools if they are not concerned.

The crypto market is just starting. There's nothing technically to stop it going to trillions.
