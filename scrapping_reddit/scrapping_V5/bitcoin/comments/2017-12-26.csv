"> Which central bank manages difficulty level?

Bitcoin's monetary policy is written in its code. The reason its stable is because no single authority can change that monetary policy. In fact, its an entirely opt in monetary policy. I see now tho that your definition of ""monetary policy"" is different from mine. Which is why I asked you for your definition. It would be nice if you simply answered my question instead of giving me a snarky response.

> The federal reserve doesn't print money, the US mint does that.

Ok. The FED **creates** money. That's what I meant. In fact, the US mint does not create money, but prints money given to it as existing bills or accounts (including FED accounts). 

> all of your assertions are stupid

All of your assertions are unsupported. I'm also disappointed that you wasted your time. Maybe next time you'll actually write the reasons you think these things and you can actually have a real discussion rather than wasting your time (and mine).

Have you ever heard of Bio Mineral Balance, Alkaline Vegan. Research headed up by a gentleman by the name of Dr. Sebi. He passed away last year. This man has given and studied to rid the body of disease. I have followed many people that have gotten rid of all types of cancers, diabetes, MS, and even AIDS and Herpes. He even beat the Supreme Court many years ago with evidence of such. If you are doing any research I would start there because this is the only group of ppl I have seen consistently and successfully rid themselves of diseases. Itâ€™s basically ridding your body of mucus through a diet where only certain foods can be eaten. ;1;0;False;polymathace;drsab0q;I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes!

"Such an admirable cause
We are a small salon in Beverly Hills, CA USA
We have a diversified crew of stylists / colorists coming from about 10 different countries and we are making sure to get along well regardless of political views, gender, sex, religion etc. We have lots of applicants from poor neighborhoods that would like to come and train with our experts. We would love to help many of these youngsters to learn and acquire a profession and a license that will enable them to get out of the circle of poverty and live a life they can be proud of.
We are seeking funding for Brighton Salon LLC to put a program together to reach and help fulfill these dreams.
Please let us know how are we to continue with this project.
Sincerely
David and Nurit Cohen

"I can't send a suggestion to the website but please consider donating to fusion energy project at the tail end of making a clean energy reactor
It's a small company with limited funding as opposed to the other large public money/government backed initiatives out there. I believe investing in these types of impact projects by impassioned teams and limited resources could benefit and in return benefit all. Here is there website, please consider reaching out to them and see if where they can use the help :)  thanks so much!
