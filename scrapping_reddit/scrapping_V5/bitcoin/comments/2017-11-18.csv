">Why would anyone want to ""fork""?

In the most basic terms: to upgrade or change properties or functionality of the network.  Cryptocurrencies are fundamentally an opt-in/opt-out system (as opposed to a democracy or some kind of autocracy)...that's the benefit and the curse of a decentralized governance mechanism: you can leave or change any time you want, but you can't force everyone else to leave with you or join your new blockchain or ""fork"" of the original chain.  You have to garner consensus and consent.

>How will their fork be recognised or accepted? Will multiple forks devalue Bitcoin?

Forks are created all the time, actually, and most die away (or live) on their own merits.  Whether a fork garners support or ""network effect"" is an economic question (not technical); again, people have to consciously use your new protocol.

For an existential crisis, such as a weakness found in, say the SHA256 algorithm, you would likely see very quick and very thorough consensus form around an emergency hard fork (would probably come by way of a simple software update from the Core developers).  Very few people would stick with the old chain (the coins would quickly become worthless), and nearly everyone would start using the new chain (which preserves all balances and past transactions, but lacks the dangerous exploit of the core cryptographic functions)..the exchange price of the coins would certainly experience great turbulence, but would likely settle back to close to where they had been before the exploit was found. We know this is likely, because we've seen such a successful emergency hard-fork happen, with a problem not even as serious as the one I just outlined.

On the other hand: lets say that a bunch of bitcoin users want to make a change to the protocol which is something which doesn't fix an immediate or drastic problem, but which they believe is necessary in the long run...well, then you're going to get a lot of disagreement and politics and a very difficult time building consensus around your desired fork (e.g. here is obviously the recent Bitcoin Cash hard fork), and you're going to have a lot of people stay with the old chain, and a lot of people move to the new chain, and even more people use both.

The really interesting thing that we observe here is how subjective value is: we might think that a split like the latter would tend to result in two coins which would tend to settle back to a price which, combined, adds up to something close to the value of the original alone.  But this isn't always the case, because value had actually been being destroyed or locked up, before the fork happened and could finally be realised and expressed in exchange prices after the fork.

With money (or proto-monies, which is what cryptocurrencies are), network effect is almost everything. New features and fixes are great, but network goods ossify quickly (for what should be obvious reasons...so many independent parties and interests, the more the harder, are never going to come to agreements on trivial things, or even important things...only existential crises).  But there is even greater value in a stable backdrop, a standard, which is just good enough (think ipv4 vs. Ipv6 and why technically-inferior standards tend to stick around).";3;0;False;kwanijml;dq0nqwb;This is why I want bitcoin to hit $10,000;7dpypn;https://i.redd.it/fhzsxgcv9nyz.jpg

"The price of bitcoin is determined entirely by supply and demand. The price is not even the same between different exchanges operating inside the same country.

If a country restricts its bitcoin supply in any way the price will increase locally, but may over time return to the global equilibrium.

Restrictions may include:

* No exchanges in country (money needs to sent to a foreign exchange)
* Exchanges cannot accept credit card payment
* etc.

The same thing will happen if something increases the demand, such as:

* High inflation on local currency
* Problems with the local banks

"Borders don't matter. However, the ability of people to purchase in different areas matters. 

Some fiat currencies are basically garbage, and you need to spend more of that to get a bitcoin. 

For example, if you know that your purchasing power with XYZ currency will be less tomorrow, you want to get rid of it, and so does everyone else. So, at the current exchange rate you need to big higher to get that bitcoin than other people. 

What you're saying is that you will forgo the use of that money for a period of time until you recoup the purchasing power with the rise of the bitcoin price, or the lowering value of the fiat currency.

"**Tulip mania**

Tulip mania, tulipmania, or tulipomania (Dutch names include: tulpenmanie, tulpomanie, tulpenwoede, tulpengekte and bollengekte) was a period in the Dutch Golden Age during which contract prices for some bulbs of the recently introduced and fashionable tulip reached extraordinarily high levels and then dramatically collapsed in February 1637. It is generally considered the first recorded speculative bubble (or economic bubble); although some researchers have noted that the Kipper- und Wipperzeit (literally Tipper and See-saw) episode in 1619–1622, a Europe-wide chain of debasement of the metal content of coins to fund warfare, featured mania-like similarities to a bubble. In many ways, the tulip mania was more of a hitherto unknown socio-economic phenomenon than a significant economic crisis (or financial crisis). And historically, it had no critical influence on the prosperity of the Dutch Republic, the world's leading economic and financial power in the 17th century.

"No he didn't or not?

""In 2009, he started a company that he said would manufacture plants from the Belize jungle into antibiotics. His lab was raided in May 2012 by the police department’s Gang Suppression Unit on suspicion he was manufacturing methamphetamine. He says the raid was retribution for his refusal to be extorted by the government. No illegal drugs were found during the raid. He was never charged and the lab was eventually shut down.

The Belize government declined ABC News’ request for comment.

McAfee was catapulted to the headlines again in November 2012. This time Belizean authorities linked him to a more serious crime, naming him ""a person of interest"" in the mysterious slaying of 52-year-old Gregory Faull, a U.S. man who was McAfee’s neighbor two doors down from McAfee’s beachside compound. McAfee went into hiding, telling ABC News at the time he was afraid the authorities were trying to kill him.

He has denied any involvement in Faull's death.

After being on the run for almost a month, McAfee was arrested in Guatemala by Guatemalan immigration officials for entering the country illegally. He was about to be deported back to Belize when he collapsed. McAfee later said he had faked a heart attack.

“Sure, I faked it""

"Sorry, you understand completely wrong. This is not possible because of floating point errors.

Bitcoin wallets actually move Satoshis. That's the true single unit. The hard cap of 21m Bitcoins is actually a hard cap of 2,100,000,000,000,000 Satoshis.

Sub-dividing Satoshis would introduce floating point errors in code. Dividing Satoshis into a factor of 10 (i.e. adding another decimal place) is not any different than making the hard cap 210 million smaller (1/10th) bitcoins instead of 21 million current-sized ones. Why? Because a Satoshi must remain a whole number, so the hard cap becomes 21,000,000,000,000,000 satoshis (10x more) and 1 current BTC becomes 10 of the new BTC.

Back in my senior year of highschool my friend and I were talking about investing back when it was at $240. Of course we weren't exactly sure how, and it was senior year so we looked into it for about an hour before giving up, out of sheer laziness. I forgot about it, then a couple months ago I checked, and saw that it had climbed to 2thousand! I bitched to my friend for about how if we weren't so lazy we could have gotten in on that, and then forgot about it again, until now. Fuck my life!

"LOL I was sleeping but I am now awake to a million notifications. Just an update for everyone since there is a real possibility that 10k will happen in 2017. 

. No i havent forgotten, I get messages everyday at this point

. No I havent sold any of my coins, in fact I have more than when I made that statement. 

. I always thought bitcoin would hit 10k but I didnt think it would happen in 2017, which is why I made the comment. Personally I thought it would be more like 2019-2020 during the next halving, but things happened much quicker than I thought.

. John McAfee has nothing on me


At this point im mostly just trying to run out the clock. Since there is a possibility of it happening, I should probably set specifics. The price has to cross 10k USD on the bitcoinity average (so we get a nice gif) it cant be a flash spike like what happened to gemini a few months ago, it has to be what most people would consider real . If it happens I will do something, I promise.

"**Werner Herzog Eats His Shoe**

Werner Herzog Eats His Shoe is a short documentary film directed by Les Blank in 1980 which depicts director Werner Herzog living up to his promise that he would eat his shoe if Errol Morris ever completed the film Gates of Heaven. The film includes clips from both Gates of Heaven and Herzog's 1970 feature Even Dwarfs Started Small. Comic song ""Old Whisky Shoes"", played by the Walt Solek Band, is the signature tune over the opening and closing credits.

Filmed in April, 1979, the film features Herzog cooking his shoes (the ones he claims to have been wearing when he made the bet) at the Berkeley, California restaurant Chez Panisse, with the help of chef Alice Waters.

"They are both common variable types in many programming languages. INT is an integer, a whole number with no decimal point. A float is a floating point number, a number that can be fractional with a decimal point.

You have to define the type of variable before you can assign a value to it. If the number is never intended to be fractional, it is more efficient to define that as an integer, and if you wanted to make that capable of fractional numbers, you would first need to redefine that variable type.

"Well, I was going to say ""You're clearly not a computer scientist"" but then changed my mind because I'm really annoyed by other people on Reddit making assumptions about me. ""Fuck, maybe he *has* read the code, which I admittedly, have not, even though I know how to program in several languages.""

But since you asked:

In programming (most languages) variables have different types. Two of the most basic are an `int` which is short for integer (whole number) and a `float` meaning a decimal number.

Doing math with floating point values (decimals) is generally poor practice. This is because it tends to have errors in it. Two examples:

1. I learned this myself while making a basic budget app as a teenager. When working with money, you always do all calculations on cents (or tenths of cents, etc.) keeping track of the value as a whole number. Thus, you don't do €4.51 + €1.78, you do: `451+178`and then display the resulting `629` as `€6.29`. Another example is that you add `4.5` and `3.5` and then get `9.0` and then want 10% so you divide by 10, expecting to get `0.9` but instead get `0.899999999999999999`

2. I had a lecture in my digital manufacturing class about a proposed change in 3D printing to use voxelized formats instead of typical .STL files since slicing an .STL file with vertices recorded in space as floating point numbers tended to introduce rounding errors in the print. Using tiny voxels (volumetric pixels) means that you were never working with amounts smaller than `1`.

This is essentially the entire reason the unit of Satoshi's actually exists. Since having a single bitcoin be your base unit which you don't divide would really suck, then it *would* be impossible to transfer any amount less than 1 BTC. So instead Nakamoto had to pick a smaller base unit which wallets actually send (and which fees are calculated with) and figured 1/10000000 should be enough.

Since you cannot divide a integer number of satoshis into a float number without inducing errors, this means you need to keep the smallest possible amount still `1` and increase the largest amount, again, making a cosmetic change such that anyone who held 1 BTC of the 21m capped coin now holds 10 BTC of the 210m capped coin.

Long story short: you absolutely cannot just add decimals to the smallest place. That's not how programming works.";2;0;False;ianpaschal;dq08i0l;This is why I want bitcoin to hit $10,000;7dpypn;https://i.redd.it/fhzsxgcv9nyz.jpg
