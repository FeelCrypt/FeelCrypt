"Hello, 
I see you’ve donated to MAPS which is great as they are researching psychedelics for therapeutic purposes and yet in the 32 years they’ve been operating no research into Hallucinogen Persistent Perception Disorder (HPPD) has ever been conducted.

The Neurosensory Neuroregenerative Research Foundation has created a team to address this disorder and if successful would salvage the lives of the afflicted and prevent anyone from ever having to endure the suffering that comes with HPPD.

Please consider helping us as there exists no federal funding for HPPD. Solving HPPD in a way will make psychedelics safe for everyone.

Thank you
