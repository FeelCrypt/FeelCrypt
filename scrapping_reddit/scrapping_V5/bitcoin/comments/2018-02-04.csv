There is a crazy bull run which goes hyperbolic before pulling back. In theory it will continue this pattern if they become mainstream and are used everyday. Just be patient.

Don't be silly. The history shows that the price has risen. You haven't intelligently spotted booms, they've just been happening.

Jeez, you will lose your money if you think you were ""smart"" to make money with bitcoin. The price rose thousands of percent over an incredibly short time - any useless cunt on the planet could win buying it.

> Cashing out coins has never been concern to me at all, and I‚Äôve done it with no issues quite a few times now

Yes, but if you keep throwing your money back in you will lose it eventually. The bubble will burst, maybe it already has.

Point being (a) You've lost money by selling and buying back at a higher price, maybe you feel this has hedged your bets, but it certainly shows that you don't have any great insight, and (b) You have no more idea than anyone else what the future holds and (c) You're most definitely not smarter than anyone else.

"**Escalation of commitment**

Escalation of commitment is a human behavior pattern in which an individual or group facing increasingly negative outcomes from some decision, action, or investment nevertheless continues the same behavior rather than alter course. The actor maintains behaviors that are irrational, but align with previous decisions and actions.

Economists and behavioral scientists use a related term, sunk-cost fallacy, to describe the justification of increased investment of money, time, lives, etc. in a decision, based on the cumulative prior investment (""sunk cost""); despite new evidence suggesting that the cost, beginning immediately, of continuing the decision outweighs the expected benefit.

Your example also works, you'd just hold the BTC indefinitely while the price goes up if you have other currency to spend. Which is my point, BTC doesn't work as currency because it's always economically preferable to hold it and spend USD instead.

"Suppose blockchain does get implimented in a major way, why does that increase the value of Bitcoin? It doesn't.

The greater fool theory at its finest. 

""Value"" is relative but in most cases it's backed by some underlying fundamental source of income. Growing corporate profits, interest yields, dividend payments. With stocks you can extrapolate a price-to-earnings ratio. With yields you can calculate an objective ROI. You can calculate neither of these for Bitcoin. Why? Because the price is based 100% in speculation. BLOCKCHAIN DOES NOT MAKE MONEY.

The fact that BTC investors have convinced themselves that there's profit to be had by the widespread adoption of the underlying technology (which, frankly, seems unlikely given the scaling problems associated with ""proof of work"") demonstrates the fundamental disconnect between crypto ""investors"" and the financial realities of investing capital.

"**HODL**

HODL is a slang term and Internet meme that is used in the Bitcoin community when referring to keeping, i.e. holding onto the cryptocurrency rather than selling it. It originated in a December 2013 post on the Bitcoin Forum message board by an apparently inebriated user who posted with a typo in the subject, ""I AM HODLING."" In 2017, Quartz listed it as one of the essential slang terms in Bitcoin culture, and described it as a stance, ""to stay invested in bitcoin and not to capitulate in the face of plunging prices."" The Street.com referred to it as the ""favorite mantra"" of Bitcoin holders. According to the Financial Times, it was the reddit forum Buttcoin that helped popularize its use.
