">Hold no matter what is viable strategy in any market that's not a scam

Was property in Detroit a scam? Were tulips in 17th century Holland a scam?

Hold no matter what is literally not a strategy because ""no matter what"" means ""I will do this regardless of what results it produces"". ""hold no matter what"" is just a feeling from people who are afraid to realize losses and sunk costs.

"Except you're still misusing terms. The government doesn't enforce common ownership under socialism, rather, worker syndicates abduct power from the government. You're using the term ""common ownership"" loosely and informally, where I'm using it to refer to a specific technical concept.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_ownership

The reason many governments are nominally socialist is because those countries had legitimate, large-scale people's uprisings and worker movements that were ultimately crushed. You're misinformed because of cold war era propaganda, unfortunately. However it's all on Wikipedia, if you ever decide to seriously investigate the topic. To have a persuasive argument, you should fully appreciate the opposite perspective.";0;1;False;starry7;dpeqa9a;Lily Allen turned down 200K in Bitcoins for a gig in 2009 which is worth $1,426,199,000 as of this writing;7aq0fx;https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/lily-allen-calls-herself-an-idiot-for-declining-bitcoin-payment-now-worth-millions-9046211.html
