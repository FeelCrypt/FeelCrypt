Who are you, that you get to decide what the ""ultimate aims of education"" are? Who died and left you to define the purpose of the pursuit of knowledge?

Your argument doesn't have a premise.  There is no discernible argument to dismiss.  You inability to produce one is the basis of my skepticism of your academic credentials.

You clearly don't understand the concept of hegemony.  The modern status-quo is a neo-liberal interpretation of schools as spaces to produce participants in a market economy.  While I recognize the importance of trade-skill training, this is a strong deviation from my primary argument that education, especially higher-education, is a space for developing one's ability to critically evaluate the accepted status-quo and hold nuanced understandings of issues in order to be more productive members of a democratic society.

These things have value. Bitcoin is literally valueless. You are assigning it value based on it's 'rarity' and saying ""look, it's a currency now""

Just think of it this way: If there were only 10 people on earth who wanted bitcoin, then bitcoin would be relatively worthless, as there are millions of bitcoin. Each one would be worth barely anything. 

Now, the pool has grown to millions of people. There is still the same amount of bitcoin, it doesn't change. The value has risen drastically because of the expanding pool; this leads to deflation, which causes people to hold on to their coins, because they believe the value will be greater in the future. As people sell their coins, the pool shrinks, and the value decreases. This leads to a massive drop.

Your bank charges you fees. You pay taxes. Part of both go towards keeping the infrastructure for the USD fiat system in place. (Keeping those dollars fresh) I don't see the fees as an argument against the system. Yes I agree, they are too high right now, but it's a new tech.

Cash is instant but can also be counterfeit (especially USD, you guys need to get on that!) Credit cards are not instant and you risk identity theft. There is a serious problem with chargebacks. Also, it's not settled for quite some time. Near instant settlement WILL be accomplished with bitcoin, just taking some time for the technology to get caught up to the influx of people.

Well if I put btc in a wallet... it'll be the same amount 5, 10, 20 years from now. Maybe you're talking about the value. Go look up the value of the dollar and see how much it's fluctuated over the years. Food prices actually don't go up, it's becoming easier and easier to produce and distribute food. But the value of a dollar has been going waaaay down, so it looks like prices for food go up (probably worse in Canada than US). Your dollar is being devalued and is deflationary. Maybe you can argue why that's a good thing... but you can't say the value will be the same in 5, 10, 20 years. Also, maybe in the US you've got a better chance in the long run, but what about Venezuela, Argentina?

"Nicehash is a one stop shop for mining that will pick the most profitable algorithm for your computer and pay you in bitcoin. My 970 gets me about 1.50/day. I use “one click miner” to mine vertcoin (mainly because I love vertcoin, but they just halved the block reward so it may not be that worthwhile anymore), or you could try minergate, which will probably have you mining monero. If you’re looking for a little more DIY, you could check out ccminer or cgminer, which will allow you to choose which coin you mine. They require a bit more input on your part, but the process is easily explained by google. 

Realistically though nowadays I haven’t found a coin that’s “profitable” to mine. Machines specifically designed for mining have completely taken over big game coins like bitcoin. I’ve been aiming more towards any miner that’ll give me a relatively large volume of coin in the hopes that it’ll be worth more money in the future. If that’s your aim, I’ve been using minergate to mine BCN with my cpu (I still use my gpu to mine vertcoin as mentioned above) and I’ve gotten about 400 coins.

">I know right! And then that worked out terribly for the value of gold!

The majority of demand for gold comes from the jewelry industry, not because its a failed currency.

Gold has no value as a currency, but that doesn't make gold worthless because its valuable for other things.

One of the reasons gold was abandoned as a currency was because people kept hoarding and melting down coins because it was far more valuable as a metal than as a currency.

It becoming deflationary was a sign that it was a waste to use a very rare metal like gold for currency when more common metals like copper and steel worked just as well.

You won't want to follow this logic through when it says that bitcoin will be abandoned for a less deflationary currency.

When bitcoin becomes too deflationary to have any use as a currency (which it already nearly is even when supply is as high as it will ever be), what will it be valuable for? ""It's a store of value"", why? ""there's only a limited number"". Okay so why would I store my value in bitcoin which is valuable for nothing else except being a store of value when I could buy land, which there's also only a limited amount of but that has a million different practical uses if I can't sell it to anyone.

"You completely missed my points. The alt coins will in fact minimize transaction fees- that's why they exist. It might require an absolute minimum amount of transactions using bitcoin to get those altcoins if your store of value happens to be in bitcoin. Your original argument was that no one could possibly sell bitcoin to anyone and I showed you why you were mistaken.

""There are no fees involved if you buy and sell goods with gold.""

This is inherently false. There absolutely is a fee acquiring and depositing gold, keeping it safe, carrying it around. The overwhelming majority of interactions are made using fiat currency precisely because gold is cumbersome as a medium of exchange. This is why I explained to you how gold would still convey its value even if fiat is used in most transactions- it has a direct correlation to the bitcoin/altcoin relationship.

Gold has no more inherent value than bitcoin does. It's a piece of metal. How does it keep you alive? A loaf of bread is infinitely more valueable in a true end of the world scenario than a lump of metal. This fallacious argument has been used ad nauseum and it's so simple to rebute. Bitcoin can't be duplicated. It's decentralized. It's immune to inflation. It's anonymous. All these add to it's value. To believe the price of bitcoin is high only because of speculation is silly.

"In a Ponzi scheme, the schemer acts as a ""hub"" for the victims, interacting with all of them directly. In a pyramid scheme, those who recruit additional participants benefit directly. (In fact, failure to recruit typically means no investment return.)
A Ponzi scheme claims to rely on some esoteric investment approach and often attracts well-to-do investors, whereas pyramid schemes explicitly claim that new money will be the source of payout for the initial investments.[9]
A pyramid scheme typically collapses much faster because it requires exponential increases in participants to sustain it. By contrast, Ponzi schemes can survive simply by persuading most existing participants to reinvest their money, with a relatively small number of new participants.[10]
Cryptocurrencies have been employed by scammers attempting a new generation of Ponzi schemes. For example, misuse of initial coin offerings, or ""ICOs,"" on the Ethereum blockchain platform have been one such method.[11] (per the Financial Times, ""smart Ponzis"").[12] The novelty of ICOs means that there is currently a lack of regulatory clarity on the classification of these financial devices, allowing scammers wide leeway to develop Ponzi schemes using these assets.[13]

Economic bubbles are also similar to a Ponzi scheme in that one participant gets paid by contributions from a subsequent participant (until inevitable collapse). A bubble involves ever-rising prices in an open market (for example stock, housing, cryptocurrency,[14][15] or tulip bulbs) where prices rise because buyers bid more, and buyers bid more because prices are rising. Bubbles are often said to be based on the ""greater fool"" theory. As with the Ponzi scheme, the price exceeds the intrinsic value of the item, but unlike the Ponzi scheme:

In most economic bubbles, there is no single person or group misrepresenting the intrinsic value. A common exception is a pump and dump scheme (typically involving buyers and holders of thinly-traded stocks), which has much more in common with a Ponzi scheme compared to other types of bubbles.
Whereas Ponzi schemes will typically result in criminal charges after they are discovered by the authorities, other than pump and dump schemes economic bubbles do not typically involve unlawful activity, or even bad faith on the part of any participant. Laws are only broken if someone is perpetuating the bubble by knowingly and deliberately making misrepresentions to inflate the value of an item (as with a pump and dump scheme).";1;1;False;Z0di;dr9kild;"Danish Bitcoin billionaire new sponsor of professional Danish ice hockey team.

"I mean, i've been looking/tracking/playing/lurking around in this space for a few years now, out of a general interest of Cryptography. Right now, I'm mostly divied up between Bitcoin, Ethereum, OmiseGo, Augur, and Enjin Coin along with a small stake in some PREICO's i thought interesting but haven't gotten off the ground yet, and probably/might not do anything at all. I look at ICOs/Alts pretty often though, to try and scout out anything that may be interesting.


Coins that I haven't invested in, but have my eye on are IOTA, Cardano, Dash, RDN, Monero, ZCash, and Substratum. There are various reasons I haven't invested yet, including sketchiness (Cardano/IOTA) not enough research done (RDN), and, from some humble calcs that probably mean nothing profitability (these calculations are very subjective, and it really just comes down to gambling). However, if I do invest in another coin, there's much more of a % of me investing in coins I have my eye on/have done previous research on.

When people say '90% of ICO's are a scam', I am not going to lie, it's usually true. Though, some aren't a scam and just fail immediately because their entire concept is shit. It's mostly like gambling though; you just have to invest a little money and see where it goes, but be 100% aware that you have a 50/50 chance of losing everything, with the other 50 being 45% breaking even with the hope of going up sometime, and 5% making some money. (these percentages are out of my ass, obviously, but that's what it feels like). Though, all in all, when an ICO *does* do well, I tend to make up what I lost with other ICO's. An amount of diversification plays into it, too.


But, the rule i always follow when investing in any crypto, ICO or not, is just to do as much research as you can with your time, and only invest in projects that you believe in. I invested in ENJ because I do/have played a fuckton of videogames in the past, and I see that the coin has real potential in the market they are going to chase. In addition to this, they already have up against competing coins (GameCredits, etc) in their developers  and Community Base (they are a company which runs forums for gamers, with the # of members in the millions, with many communities already signed up to use the coin) The research I did shows that what they're trying to achieve is absolutely realistic. I won't invest in random coins in a market that I know absolutely nothing on how it operates (like those coins used for selling meat goods, or Credit coins, or other coins like that. They may be 100% viable, or they may be total shitcoins. I have no idea, so when I come across something like that, I immediately skip it).

You also have to be aware of what existing coins are capable of. If a coin comes out and can do nothing different than a coin that already established a userbase (assuming the coin cant do it better than the already-established coin), that's a downright dumb buy. If a coin does something which can already be done on an existing coin/blockchain, that's another stupid buy. Why create a coin who's use can already be had quite easily with another (much more established) coin? Not much use there.
That's part of the reason ERC20 coins (coins created with the ETH ecosystem) are so cool. _Because_ they have the base of a community already, Ethereum,

that's just my 2c and experience though.

TL;DR: Be aware of existing coins and what they do; stay open-minded to new coins and what they may be capable of; don't invest in stupid shit that can already be accomplished with existing coins; only invest in shit you believe in/have experience a knowledgebase in; do your research.

The first line alone completely contradicts your point. How can bitcoin be a Ponzi scheme when there is no ""schemer"", interacting with all participants directly?

Again: you need to spend a small amount of time reading up on what a Ponzi scheme is. Here's a start:

>A Ponzi scheme (/ˈpɒn.zi/; also a Ponzi game)[1] is a fraudulent investment operation where the operator generates returns for older investors through revenue paid by new investors, rather than from legitimate business activities or profit of financial trading.

Bitcoin trading on regulated exchanges isn't fraudulent, there is no operator, and return isn't being generated through revenue paid by new investors. None of this definition matches what bitcoin is.

"So your entire argument is that bitcoin fees won't negatively affect bitcoin because altcoin trading avoids fees somehow?  Sorry, but transfering you bitcoin means I pay a fee.  It doesn't matter if you are sending me back cash, altcoins, or physical goods.  There is no way around the fee.

As long as there are high fees for transmitting coin between people, bitcoin isn't sustainable as a currency.

Right now its value is proped up on supply and demand.   If demand drops, it all crumbles.  If supply(the amount of people trying to sell) increases, it all crumbles.

Bitcoin requires more people to be buying bitcoin for cash than are trying to sell it for cash.  When that ratio flips, bitcoin flips.

>According to your logic, the value of gold would ""collapse"" because it's not a good currency.

Gold is free to hand to someone. There are no fees involved if you buy and sell goods with gold.  Gold only requires a fee if you want to convert it to cash and only because someone might not buy gold from  you directly as there is no level of trust.  If you must sell to a middle man, then there is a fee.  

That said, if no one wanted to buy gold, the price of gold would fall.  It is still supply and demand.  It has an advantage in that it is a physical product that goes into electronics so there will always be some kind of demand for it and that large holders of it aren't selling what they have.  If everyone who owned gold tried to sell it at the same time, the price would drop heavily.  The floor would be based on the demand by companies using it for products who must still buy it. If they are willing to buy tons of it for future production at low prices that would prevent even lower prices.

>According to you, the dollar doesn't need gold to function- and no one would ever purchase gold with dollars. It's just poor analytical thinking on your part.

This seemlying has nothing to do with what I said and makes little sense. You seem to have a chip on your shoulder.  First, the dollar is not pegged to gold.  Gold could become worthless tomorrow, it would harm the value of the dollar.  In fact, it would increase the value of the dollar since more people would want dollars.  Second, the reverse is meaningless.  Why would it matter if people buy gold with dollars?  Not sure what you mean by this.

"Half of the world doesn't have access to banks but most of them do have access to rudimentary smart phones. Bitcoin (or a form of cryptocurrency) could essentially bank the unbanked half of the world (3 billion people) with the simple downloading of an app. Is there no value in that?

Because you wouldn't have bought back then. The thing is, bitcoin can raise up to a million in the next 10-20 years. You won't believe me now and therefor you won't put money into it. Back then was the exact same thing, no one who didn't really understand what Bitcoin is would believe that it'll reach 15k one day and surely not within a year, so everyone said that the price is to high already and wouldn't buy. That same thing is repeating right now and in 10 years people will complain how they didn't buy when btc was at 15k. You just think that you would have bought because now you already know it would have reached 17k. You just have to accept that you would have done back then the same that you are doing now. Have you put anything into bitcoin now? No? Then don't be mad, you wouldn't have invested back then either. If you have now then congrats, you might reap a fortune in 10-20 years if you have the patience and mindset not to sell when the price doubles.;1;1;False;thorle;dra2lyz;"Danish Bitcoin billionaire new sponsor of professional Danish ice hockey team.

Second scenario. Invest the same amount, $100. Bitcoin rises 2x. You hold. Bitcoin rises 5x. You sell for $1,000. You now have $1,000.

In the first strategy you minimize the risk of losing $100 but at the same time you are making possible future profits smaller.

"Depends on when and how. He's not functionally wealthy if his only assets are Bitcoin. It's nearly impossible to liquidate that number of crypto at this value. For example, if you had 100 million in gold you'd have about 2.5 tons of it. Try to buy anything with that. Need to by a Camry? You'd have to find someone who will buy $20,000 worth of gold for cash. Not saying it's impossible, but most crypto markets, like banks, limit the amount of cash you can take out. Also, Bitcoin doesn't pay dividends.

So, maybe you slowly cash out what you need this year, say $100k just to be comfortable. Then Bitcoin crashes down to $5k or less, or completely bottoms out (unlikely). You're fucked.

"You don't get it.  No one can convert bitcoin to cash without selling it to someone who wants to convert cash to bitcoin.  Period.  

That is the only way.  I people buying into bitcoin dries up, bitcoin will crash because people are still going to want out and will have to lower what they get hoping to attract buyers.

"No, that's not the only way.

>Companies that engage in Ponzi schemes focus all of their energy into attracting new clients to make investments. Ponzi schemes rely on a constant flow of new investments to continue to provide returns to older investors. When this flow runs out, the scheme falls apart.[2]



>In a Ponzi scheme, the schemer acts as a ""hub"" for the victims, interacting with all of them directly. In a pyramid scheme, those who recruit additional participants benefit directly. (In fact, failure to recruit typically means no investment return.)
A Ponzi scheme claims to rely on some esoteric investment approach and often attracts well-to-do investors, whereas pyramid schemes explicitly claim that new money will be the source of payout for the initial investments.[9]
A pyramid scheme typically collapses much faster because it requires exponential increases in participants to sustain it. By contrast, Ponzi schemes can survive simply by persuading most existing participants to reinvest their money, with a relatively small number of new participants.[10]
Cryptocurrencies have been employed by scammers attempting a new generation of Ponzi schemes. For example, misuse of initial coin offerings, or ""ICOs,"" on the Ethereum blockchain platform have been one such method.[11] (per the Financial Times, ""smart Ponzis"").[12] The novelty of ICOs means that there is currently a lack of regulatory clarity on the classification of these financial devices, allowing scammers wide leeway to develop Ponzi schemes using these assets.[13]

>Economic bubbles are also similar to a Ponzi scheme in that one participant gets paid by contributions from a subsequent participant (until inevitable collapse). A bubble involves ever-rising prices in an open market (for example stock, housing, cryptocurrency,[14][15] or tulip bulbs) where prices rise because buyers bid more, and buyers bid more because prices are rising. Bubbles are often said to be based on the ""greater fool"" theory. As with the Ponzi scheme, the price exceeds the intrinsic value of the item, but unlike the Ponzi scheme:

>In most economic bubbles, there is no single person or group misrepresenting the intrinsic value. A common exception is a pump and dump scheme (typically involving buyers and holders of thinly-traded stocks), which has much more in common with a Ponzi scheme compared to other types of bubbles.
Whereas Ponzi schemes will typically result in criminal charges after they are discovered by the authorities, other than pump and dump schemes economic bubbles do not typically involve unlawful activity, or even bad faith on the part of any participant. Laws are only broken if someone is perpetuating the bubble by knowingly and deliberately making misrepresentions to inflate the value of an item (as with a pump and dump scheme).";1;1;False;Z0di;dr9ju35;"Danish Bitcoin billionaire new sponsor of professional Danish ice hockey team.

"I’m an me sufferer, i have been dismissed and neglected by modern medicine. I have just had to write a letter to my gp because she recommended a harmful exercise as treatment. This is a very serious illness with a biological cause. It’s not tired all the time, The key symptom is an intolerance to exertion, even the slightest activity can cause horrendous payback/sickness for Upto a week. execise can cause permanent relapses and even death in very rare and extreme cases. Suicide is 5 times more likely too. It’s like living in a prison with no walls, many patients are isolated are abandoned. Poor psychological research and changing the name to chronic fatigue syndrome has muddied the waters and made a total mess. Fraudulent studies have stolen the treatment narrative and resulted in harmful exercise based treatments be adopted by NICE and CDC. Thankfully these treatments have been shown to be ineffective and harmful and are being dropped. Research is massively underfunded for such a common disease and is way behind other equivalent diseases. The disease has no specialty home, there are a handful of doctors in the world, patients are left to fend for themselves as Gps don’t know how to treat it.

> **Is there room for more funding?** We believe that AMF is very likely to be constrained by funding. There is high uncertainty in the maximum amount that AMF could use productively, though we expect the maximum to be much greater than what AMF is likely to receive. To fund all of the distributions that it is currently in detailed discussions about, AMF would need $50 million more than we project it will receive.

"Hi Pine!

I think you are _probably_ relatively well-protected if you are being sufficiently careful -- I see ""offline"" and ""we"", and I hope your procedure involves something like: at least two different people verify every aspect of each transaction, on at least two computers.

In that case, and assuming you're using robust software (by which I mean Bitcoin Core), I'm not aware of any specific examples of this having gone wrong in the past.

One interesting corner case was recently discussed on the bitcoin-dev mailing list (I just googled ""bitcoin 'cosmic ray'"" for examples, and it turned up): while transaction _addresses_ are protected by checksums, and in robust software such as Bitcoin Core they should be well-protected, transaction _amounts_ have no such protection. So the following scenario is possible today:

- You instruct your online wallet to send 50 BTC to address 'B'
- Your online wallet crafts a transaction that spends your 4000 BTC UTXO, sending 50 BTC to address 'B' and 3950 BTC back to a new change address, 'C'
- In the transfer to your offline wallet, a single bit flips, and 3950 becomes 1902
- You check the amount being sent to the _destination_ on the offline wallet, but you don't check the amount sent to _change_
- 2048 bitcoins are accidentally sent to fees in the transaction you sign and transmit.

As to whether bitflips actually happen: they absolutely do although I don't have a convincing specific example handy (I've asked my coworkers for one.) If you're using consumer hardware without ECC RAM, here's an article computing the expected bitflip rate:

http://lambda-diode.com/opinion/ecc-memory

The conclusion is ""the probability of having at least one bit error in 4 gigabytes of memory at sea level on planet Earth in 72 hours is over 95%.""

The specific example I gave can be prevented by checking every aspect of the transaction, including all addresses and all amounts (including change) very carefully before signing. I can't immediately think of a specific failure that couldn't be avoided by (1) checking the transaction carefully on the computer where you construct it; (2) checking the transaction carefully on the offline computer before signing; and (3) checking the transaction carefully _again_ on the online computer before broadcast (this protects against e.g. bitflips after (2) but before the actual signing process.) This is all assuming you're using Bitcoin Core, which is itself very careful to double-check everything.

Still, I hope you can see why the notion of keeping so much money in a single UTXO is scary to me; this whole process is very delicate, and a single unnoticed bit error in the wrong place could render it lost, and bit errors absolutely do happen in the real world. (Of course, you are not the first person by far to keep an astronomical sum in a single UTXO; MtGox very famously did so in order to prove solvency once, before later becoming insolvent. But I wouldn't take advice from MtGox.)

I am very glad to hear that you are working offline, carefully, with multiple people (hopefully) checking things before they go out. That will save you from many failure modes far more likely than the one I'm concerned about. (But I was mostly assuming that already, since your coins have survived this long!) It's mostly just a belt-and-suspenders thing. You can never be too careful, and this is the first time in human history that such a large amount of value could ever have hinged irretrievably on a single bit. (In banking, at least, such an error could be manually rolled back! In Bitcoin, we play for keeps. And consumer computer hardware kind of sucks and is not designed for high-assurance work!)

I greatly appreciate what you're doing! It's a wonderful thing and I hope it all goes off without a hitch (and I hope people stop sending you pleas to personally send them bitcoin, since I see you've upgraded the wording on that at least once and added boldface to it... but I'm sure they won't.)

"https://de.serlo.org

Nelson Mandela said once: ""Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world"". 
My parents weren't rich or got an academic background, so they couldn't offer me the best education - I had to do it on my own. Nevertheless I was intelligent enought to know where to go and what to do to find my way through the german school system. 
Today I'm 34 and I knew that I could have made it better with my skillset - I could have get better degrees and though a chance to go to a university, but there was no one who supported me.

I wish there were more associations, foundations and institutions like serlo.org who supports people to get a better education!

The man who established serlo early recognized that he got a ""pole-position"" in life cause of his well situated and supportive family. He wants to share it with those who haven't got that luck... The existance of Serlo depends on donations so I hope you can support them with 1Million or whatever you think is reasonable.

This Means that it is in the interest of gofundme to stimulte anybody to ask for anything after all every dollar donated will mean Money in the cooprate pockets and with 3000 new campaigns per day that is a lot of Money made. Sadly this also Means that loads of scammers will make post on gofundme.   as go fundme allows anybody to use any name and you can even send the Money to a differend account .     

So a new way of crowndfunding that will bennefit people without that some Commercial industry as owner earns Money on it combined with security measures that will keep scammers at bay , this could often be that people that write they had a car accident would provide a police report and if your dog is sick then a vet bill with the name and phone number of the vet should be possible.     

second sugestion , you like pineapple I like bamboo , bamboo is the fastes growing product that can be used for anything like clothing , thoothbrush, Building material , food etc etc , so mayeb some Money could be used to make and grow more environmental products that coudl crreate jobs at the same time.   maybe some small research grant in developing Bamboo as a more meanstream product.    

a Kill the pay day loan program , to many ""stupid"" people will get in traps of payday loans , a politica lobby against it combined with a loan system that would help people to get out the 26 % loans would help a lot of people .   This could be done by introducting a P to P loan system where Groups of people help people to get out of dept ( via paypal goods and service )so there is not a lot of risq for whomever helps to give the loan but it would need a platform and legal advice behind it.      

I know that all these ideas need some creative thinking and maybe a small think tank , but it could have a huge impact on many people

"Pineapple Fund, THANK YOU for doing this! I just submitted our grant request on behalf of The Alliance for Eating Disorders Awareness.  With your support, we can give hope and access to resources for recovery.  

Eating Disorder facts are startling, you can have the power to help change these statistics, thank you!

**The Impact of Eating Disorders on Our Communities**

* **At least than 30 million Americans will battle an eating disorder during their lifetime**

* **Every 62 minutes at least one person dies as a direct result of an eating disorder**

* Eating disorders are devastating, biologically-based mental illnesses that wreak havoc on the lives of individuals struggling as well as their families and loved ones 

* Physicians are not trained on how to identify and manage eating disorders:  the majority of medical residents reported receiving fewer than 5 hours of training in this area, if any

* Eating disorders do not discriminate.  Eating disorders affect people of all genders, ages, races, ethnicities, body shapes and weights, sexual orientations, and socioeconomic statuses

**The Impact of Eating Disorders on Children and Adolescents**  

* There has been a **119% increase in the last decade for hospitalization for children under 12 years old**, admitted for an eating disorder

* According to the Journal of Adolescent Health, 81% of 10 year olds are more afraid of being fat than getting cancer

* **Anorexia has the highest mortality rate of all mental disorders** 

* Young people ages 15-24 years with anorexia have 10 times the risk of dying compared to their same age peers

* **Eating disorders are the 3rd most common chronic illness among adolescent females**

* Among adolescents with an eating disorder, fewer than 1 in 5 have received treatment

* Over one-half of teenage girls and nearly one-third of teenage boys use unhealthy weight control behaviors such as skipping meals, fasting, smoking cigarettes, vomiting, and taking laxatives

* According to a sample of American elementary school girls who read magazines, 69% reported that the images pictured influenced their concept of the ideal body shape; 47% of them stated that the pictures made them want to lose weight

"I honestly admire you for this, however, financially speaking the way you want to donate isn't the most effective way of giving and helping the most people, consider something like this:

- Year 1 : give 20 millions
- Year 2:  give 25 millions (while still holding $175 million in  bitcoins as it reaches 50k by 2019)
- Year 3:  Give 30 millions (while still holding $230 million in  bitcoins as it reaches 75k by 2020)
- Year 4   Give 40 millions (while still holding $300 million in  bitcoins as it reaches 100k by 2020)
- Year 5   Give 60 Millions and Continue to give away the sum relative to the growth percentage  and so on until one bitcoin is worth $200 000 - $500 000.

By doing this you will be donating close to 200 millions in just 5 years time and still keeping the donation machine alive and growing,  you can always have a stop loss in case of a bitcoin real crash scenario and then invest the One billion Dollar you now accumulated in a traditional hedge fund, and donate the 10% (100 Million every year to charity)

This can be your life project and you can still donate everything at once at time of your choosing at a later point in your life, what you are doing is never the less noble and amazing. thanks we need more people like you.

"Hi /u/PineappleFund - and thank you so much for giving to the SENS Research Foundation!

I have three other suggestions:

* Donating for research to regenerate the teeth

*Billions* of humans are affected by cavities, decaying teeth, and other gum problems. It's a universal problem which can only benefit from more research, fueled by charitable funding.

Every single one of us will be affected at some point in our live. We are so scared of going to the dentist since childhood - and it doesn't ever stop. And not even having a good hygiena will save you from losing your teeth when you're old.

Imagine if we could regenerate enamel, regenerate gum, regrow teeth. Billions of people would be relieved, and billions of dollars in healthcare costs would be saved. 

Unfortunately I don't know of an charity which distributes grants for dental research, but some googling showed me institutes which seem to undergo promising research:

KCL: https://www.kcl.ac.uk/dentistry/research/divisions/index.aspx
(seems a bit difficult to reach them through https://www.kcl.ac.uk/dentistry/contact/contactus.aspx though)

Tufts: https://dental.tufts.edu/alumni/giving

So, I don't know if you have issues with teeth, but I kindly urge you to look into that - because I and billions of others would be so glad for advances in dentistry!

* Donating for research against tinnitus

Tinnitus is ringing in the ears which affect many millions around the world and causes a lot of sorrow: https://www.ata.org/understanding-facts/impact-tinnitus

The American Tinnitus Association (ATA) is the biggest patient association in this regard, and importantly, it funds research towards a cure.

I have contacted them and suggested they fill your form.

* Donating for research against hyperacusis

""Hyperacusis is a condition that causes a person to be unable to tolerate everyday noise levels without discomfort or pain."": http://hyperacusisresearch.org/what-is-hyperacusis/

Let me tell you from personal experience that this crap is often combined with tinnitus, and makes one's life many times more miserable.

Consider this: noise is absolutely everywhere in this world, so how can one live a decent life is even normal levels of noise are an issue? Answer: it's very hard, and when you're cursed with hyperacusis, you lose your life. Very limited job opportunities, can't have a decent gathering with friends and family, difficulties to travel, etc.

I have contacted Hyperacusis Research and suggested they fill your form.";1;0;False;machinbidule;draidfq;I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes! Introducing The Pineapple Fund;7jj0oa;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7jj0oa/im_donating_5057_btc_to_charitable_causes/

I'd suggest starting to watch from 5.30 (that's the first good joke). You probably don't feel as strongly about the subject, but I'd guess most people would agree that something should be done to reduce the suffering involved.

"/u/PineappleFund this is amazing and it sparked a conversation at dinner tonight. I saw you did something similar but there is a project called Water4 I'd love you to look into, specifically their efforts for the Congolese Pygmys who are enslaved and dying of waterborne disease. The guy who essentially frontmans the project is an absolute mensch by the name of Justin Wren - he is a Bellator MMA fighter using his platform as an athlete to raise awareness that these oppressed people travel miles each morning to collect contaminated water and their children die of waterborne illness frequently. The man has gotten malaria 3 times in these travels and it has never once impacted his will. You can hear him on Joe Rogan's podcast and see how genuine and selfless he is in his mission. https://m.water4.org/fightfortheforgotten

The donations you've already made are unreal and it would change so many lives -- and bring even more awareness to bitcoin to boot -- to donate to this cause. With Joe Rogan's platform they raised over $50k in today's dollars in BITCOIN alone, to contribute anything like what you've done for these other charities would be hugely impactful and if you hear Justin speak about it you will know that such a contribution would go to not just a great cause but to one of the world's most selfless people and it would likely be the largest single contribution anyone has made to the platform.

I'm sure you are being lit up with requests but please consider this one. Clean water wells are being dug for the pygmys at like $1000 a pop or something like that. A Pineapple Fund contribution would provide literally thousands of people with clean water for decades.

"I have always been very skeptical of large charities, as much of funds are poorly allocated and often end up in the wrong hands, be it salaries or mismanagement. Though now I believe to have found a charity worth donating to. 

Sharetanzania is a small but effective charity operating in, you've guessed it, Tanzania. Here they take in children of the streets, handicapped children and their mothers, and even stray dogs. John, the founder and person in charge, believes all life is worth saving - a truly beautiful vision, uncorrupted (as far as my research and intuition tells me)

John, besides actively running a charity, also has a YouTube channel where he often posts videos about the charity, but more often than not he talks about subjects related to philosophy, esotericism, mysticism and metaphysics. Even though i highly encourage people to read into or get involved in such topics, I know it's not for everyone. I find it truly encouraging to see John spend as much time as he does on the charity but still find the time to share his thoughts and ideas on the internet, I personally have found much wisdom, knowledge and faith by aid of his videos (After nearly 20 years of atheism I recently found God through much reading, listening and inward thought)

To get a more detailed picture of the charity I suggest to check out their website: https://www.sharetanzania.co.uk/ 
If you're interested in the topics mentioned above or just want to get a sense of things on the ground or about John, I suggest to watch some of his videos: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEyS0AontNPiOFt5Pttpf0Q (note: if any of you feel cringe for people talking about Jesus or God as I did, try to see past that - the Bible is merely allegorical after all.)
