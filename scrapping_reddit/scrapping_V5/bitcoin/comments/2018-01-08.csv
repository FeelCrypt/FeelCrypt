Satoshi resolved the Byzantine Generals problem in a way that allows the network to agree on decisions. Before he did that all previous efforts at a distributed currency failed. Since the problem was essentially defined in the mid-70s and not solved until 2009, that means it took almost 40 years to resolve, i.e. roughly half the entire lifespan of computer science up to that point. That is not hype.;1;0;False;doc_samson;dscbq2n;Everyone who's trading BTC right now;7olruz;http://cdn.mutually.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/08-19.jpg
Bitcoin does do quite a few things that fiat isn't able to. It is trustless, so you are not exposed to counterparty risk. It is decentralised, borderless and censorship resistant, meaning you are not subject to government's monetary policy. Look at Greece as a place where citizens were screwed by the government when the economy faulted. It is inherently deflationary and can be used to store value, something that is important in an environment with hyper-inflation, see: Venezuela or Zimbabwe. I think fiat is important and it's not going anywhere, but there is definitely value in crypto - how much valuation it should have I think is the question.;2;0;False;ArcaneTekka;dsci0i7;Everyone who's trading BTC right now;7olruz;http://cdn.mutually.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/08-19.jpg

No one is going to switch all coins from the big boy bitcoin. Sure they may spread out their crypto wealth among many shitcoins but after some gains are had profits will be rolled back into BTC not the other way around. Constant pump and dumps over and over again with all the value eventually being converted into BTC/ETH after every dump. ;0;0;False;Ellsworth_;dscelpc;Warren Buffet:;7o9zo1;https://i.redd.it/epko0verp7801.jpg
">100k worth of BTC why would he want to switch coins

Miners can sell or convert their btc. Which a lot do already.

There are numerous coins miners can mine with the same mining equipment as they would use for bitcoin. They can switch to bitcoin cash for example.";2;1;False;;dscenxm;Warren Buffet:;7o9zo1;https://i.redd.it/epko0verp7801.jpg
If a miner already has has 100k worth of BTC why would he want to switch coins? often mining rig hardware is coin specific or can only mine a handful of specific coins. BTC mining rigs are not comparable with ETH unless modifications are made to the mining rigs. They would have to buy all new material. They have no reason to switch. Just because an alt coin becomes larger (which one never will in my opinion) does not make the new alt coin more secure.;0;1;False;Ellsworth_;dscegy3;Warren Buffet:;7o9zo1;https://i.redd.it/epko0verp7801.jpg
"This argument is about miners switching. If miners start supporting bitcoin cash, bitcoin will have no advantage.
