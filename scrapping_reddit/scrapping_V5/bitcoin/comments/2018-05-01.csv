WorldWideWeb (later renamed to Nexus to avoid confusion between the software and the World Wide Web) was the first web browser and editor. It was discontinued in 1994. At the time it was written, it was the sole web browser in existence, as well as the first WYSIWYG HTML editor.

The source code was released into the public domain on April 30, 1993.

">what i mean is, wont banks have no capital because people wont need to store their money in them. 

People can **currently** store cash themselves. They've been able to do it for millennia. They don't need banks. Most don't go it alone because they don't want the responsibility and liability to store and protect it.

I don't know why people expect that to change. The average person practices horrific IT security and is not responsible enough to be perfect protecting their wallets for a lifetime.

"If I may sound like an old fart for a moment, this is what pains me about kids today and their computing experience.

My current Dell laptop is completely sealed up so if I ever need to change a battery on that thing even, I'll have to google the hell out of it.  

But yeah, I learned so much back then! For instance, The [IBM PS/1 Model 2121 G42](https://www.tietokonemuseo.net/tietokoneita/ibm-ps1-model-2011/) we got from Sam's had a slow ass 2400 baud modem which was enough for me to get on BBSes but we decided to get a 14.4k modem for it and had no idea where it went...nothing inside looked like the modem's connectors.  It turned out, the damn thing wasn't an ISA architecture like every other PC, but Microchannel bus - essentially the Betamax of computer buses where it was technically better, but nobody used it.

">Their role in the modern day society is to allocate capital to the best projects.

They don't allocate to the ""best"".. they allocate to the highest perceived financial risk/reward.. So if a risk or reward doesn't easily lend itself to being translated into a balance sheet, it is ignored. 

In practice this means banks give money to those who already have it because they can put money into giving off a perception of reduced risk and increased reward.  And financially this is the right thing to do.  The best predictor of success is how much money some entity already has.  This isn't because of some greater inherent value, but because of the exact point that I just made--it's a positive feedback loop.  (money/investments/assets/revenue) <-> (perception of success/advertising budget/time spent on pitch deck/time to polish presentation/etc.)

But don't act like banks are doing us a favor.  There's already a tendency for people with money to get more money thrown at them.  Banks are just another entity trying to ride those coattails.
