"When you open a position in forex you don't actually receive the currency you are going long on. The potential difference between the currency you long vs the currency you short is deposited into your account when you close the position. It acts like a CFD in that way. 

I think your confusing converting currency at a bank with forex, it's not quite the same thing. 

BTC is also different from trading forex because you are actually receiving BTC which you can spend. So if you spend your btc when it's at a higher price than you paid then you do realize a profit in that way. Unless your trading a btc etn instead of ""physical"" btc.";2;0;False;FxDollarZ;dodwlzy;Bitcoin breaks $5500, less than one day after it broke $5000.;761ri4;https://i.redd.it/f2p8tajk9irz.gif

"I remember back in 2012,when I was just fourteen, me and a good friend of mine became very curious about Bitcoin, and decided to invest some of our hard earned money in it. Worked a couple of weeks for the shittiest tips, spent all the money on cards and pizza, and repeated the process a couple of times. We never took the chance in the end. We laughed about it a year later, saying that we definitely should work and do it again, while both knowing what the results of our hard work would be. 

As a result, we totally forgot about it,cause he later had lung cancer, and passed away in February last year. He was an extremely optimistic person, who died young, too young. I still mourn him to this day.

The whole point of this comment, was that I recently heard my sixteen year old brother talking about Bitcoin and how he wanted to invest in it,and it's been a while since I saw him so excited for something. But nothing hurts me more than the memory of one happy moment, that ended up as a best friend being buried under my eyes. 
Wishing the best to all investing it, I'm just letting out something that I thought was too stupid to tell anyone else

"I'm no programmer so I may not have understood that properly, but it looks like its bolting on another system that circumvents the need to use the blockchain for transactions, in which case doesn't that defeat the purpose of using a blockchain, or at least open up a lot more security holes?

It was never 0, you can't buy any BCH with 0, can you? It was $300 right out of the gate. Now it's again $300. I mentioned it went to $900 briefly. I'd call this pretty stable tbh, it's actually probably more stable than Bitcoin's recent price movements in terms of absolute dollar amounts.;1;2;False;6to23;dodld4x;Bitcoin breaks $5500, less than one day after it broke $5000.;761ri4;https://i.redd.it/f2p8tajk9irz.gif
I used 0 to indicate it's inception. Wasn't thinking you'd be this butthurt to nitpick about that (btw it started trading more closely to 500 initially). The fact is, it went from not existing to 900 in 3 weeks. And since then it has been in a steady downward trend, if you can't find a simple trend on a chart then you're hopelessly delusional. 7 days ago it was trading at 350, that is a 15% loss in a week. It has now been 'stable' for 5 days, good luck with that, maybe we should talk again in a year to see where BCH is then.;1;0;False;;doe2ji2;Bitcoin breaks $5500, less than one day after it broke $5000.;761ri4;https://i.redd.it/f2p8tajk9irz.gif

"Personally, right now, I am leaving mine on btcpop. But really it depends on what you want to do. 
 
There are hardware wallets, paper wallets, and online wallets. There was a time where I was burning up hard drives, and am personally not a fan of them. Others have theirs on secure usb drives, all I can think of with these, is too much damage, or someone mugging you (and recognizing what they look like) and losing them. Even paper wallets are dangerous, but likely the safest of them all, for portability.
 
Then there are the online wallets. None of them are government backed, so you are at the mercy of the websites. Some have left with the money. Coinbase... really shouldn't be trusted, considering they haven't given the btcc. But then, none of the companies who didn't give you the btcc should be trusted... btcpop has my money sitting in an interest bearing account, and I got my btcc. This is the ONLY online wallet I trust at this time. They also exchange most other crypto currencies.

But please remember, whatever you do... this is my personal opinions based on what I have read and seen. ";1;0;False;zycamzip;dodwbaz;Bitcoin breaks $5500, less than one day after it broke $5000.;761ri4;https://i.redd.it/f2p8tajk9irz.gif

"**Lightning Network**

The Lightning Network is a proposed solution to the bitcoin scalability problem. The software uses an off-chain protocol and is currently in alpha phase of development. It features a P2P system for making micropayments of digital currencies such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, or Vertcoin through a scale-free network of bidirectional payment channels without delegating custody of funds or trust to third parties.

It is expected that normal use of the Lightning Network consists of opening a payment channel by committing a funding transaction to the relevant blockchain, followed by making any number of Lightning transactions that update the tentative distribution of the channel's funds without broadcasting to the blockchain, followed by closing the payment channel by broadcasting the final version of the transaction to distribute the channel's funds.
