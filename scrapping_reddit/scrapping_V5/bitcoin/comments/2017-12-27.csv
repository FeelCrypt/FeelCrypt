"I was mistaken. After breaking the 12500 level, it wound up finding support again, before entering a consolidating triangle around 14 and after a longer pause than i thought was going to happen it just popped a bit to 15 and hit some resistance. there was some higher volume in the pop as well, which looks bullish. kind of looks like it'll rally back up again to $20+.

"Geez, this tweet is making its way everywhere. (Yup that's my tweet)

Couple of things that've come up that I'll try to answer:

I really don't get why people think I would have killed myself over this whole bitcoin thing. There's literally no amount of money that Bitcoin could go to that would justify that. There are worse things that can happen in your life than selling something too early and if something like this is the worst thing that ever happens to you in your life, consider yourself really lucky.

Money is just money, a means to an end. Does it sting that I could have had an insane amount of money? Sure. Does it keep me up at night? Not at all, mostly it just makes me feel a bit stupid for not understanding what I was seeing at the time to hold, even before HODL was a meme. Seriously, I looked it up and HODL's from a December 18, 2013 Bitcoin Talk Forums post.

Am I doing alright? Yeah, mostly because I have a decent job.

Do I hold crypto? Really small amounts of some low market cap coins with technology that I like. The bulk of what I had remaining from playing with crypto early on got sold recently to pay off my student loans and credit cards. Not the payday that others have gotten, but it's had a positive effect on my life, I'm sure my credit is going to improve once it all registers. Now I mostly keep up to date with crypto to see what's going on and if there are any new interesting coins with cool technology. But I'm not throwing much money at it, nor do I really intend to.

To be honest I didn't get into crypto to make some huge payday, I don't think many of us did that early. It was a new technology to play around with, something we'd never really seen before. So we dropped a hundred bucks on Mt.Gox and did some trading, trying to see how it all worked. Traded to paper wallets, sweeped them into online wallets, sent them to friends, bought pizzas, played SatoshiDice. I didn't recognize what it all meant until much, much later.

Do I remember what I spent it on? The $0.30 sell wasn't the last of my trades, I think I made like $1k once I did finally pull the bulk of my account out of Mt.Gox into my bank account, it probably went to rent or other random purchases. I was mostly happy I came out ahead.";3103;26;False;gregschoen;dru5sm3;What he would be wishing now? 😂;7mgy26;https://i.redd.it/shu3p1cshi601.jpg
No one 'knew what bitcoin would become'.  No one could possibly know that, even if they *thought* it had a lot of potential.  5x ROI is good, I respect him for taking his profit and running.

The price of a good or service or asset increases until the quantity demanded equals the quantity sold.

"I realize that. This is a decision I have to make. I have a Masters degree in business, I have a bachelors in accounting, and another bachelors in computer science. I’m just going to have to use my brain. Dammit…


I am confused and scared. What scares me is that I don’t understand this. I’ve read all sorts of stuff about every goddamn crypto out there and I still don’t get it. I teach statistics and accounting in the evenings. I priced cars during the day. I do stuff that is theoretically more complicated, and I’m lost.

I don’t know what to do. The only other thing that confuses me to this extent is women and that’s for a different sub.

"Good for you, I'm happy to hear it.   It sounds like you have a sound head on your shoulders and properly understand risks.

Still, I never assumed anything about your particular situation.   I was just agreeing with this bit of logic that says ""HODL come hell or high water"" makes little sense given volatility and BTC's use as a store of wealth long term.   There's nothing wrong with hodling, but there's nothing wrong with making a personal decision regarding when to cash out and solidify profits.

It sounds like you've made that decision, which is excellent.   It's sound investment advice for anything, pick a profit level and cash out and enjoy vs. trying to time the absolute high point of a market.";2;0;False;Supersonic_staples;drtl0q9;To the new guys, let's see how tough you really are;7lhj3w;https://i.imgur.com/vHYx0Me.gif
"oh sorry, didn't mean to be a jerk to you; 

But yeah it's disappointing that fees are so high relative to what miners could get from the coinbase transaction. 

I was expecting today's situation where fees are greater than the block reward to be something that happened way out in the year 2100+ 

But it turns out that no one thought to target fees over time to converge onto some ideal amount as a percentage of the block. So, here we are.

I don't think it's completely moot to have bitcoin. Not being able to send money cheaply is very disappointing for me. But being able to do it without permission is still important.
