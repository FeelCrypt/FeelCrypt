Unsophisticated retail investors are holding, but more importantly they're not buying the dip (BFD). Institutional money is shorting BTC. This causes a bear market. I think it's short lived.;1;0;False;BeforeYourBBQ;drwv2v1;Bitcoin today;7le7t9;https://v.redd.it/kvztwkfpqd501

"Completely agree, though that's a difficult number to quantify.  The same function can be said for any currency in circulation, though (This is why every state has a ""find unclaimed money"" service).  Our best bet to compare apples-to-apples is just to ignore that volume completely, though I'll concede it's likely higher in the crypto world than in fiat just due to the nature of digital wallets.";1;0;False;SwellsInMoisture;drw82pn;What he would be wishing now? ðŸ˜‚;7mgy26;https://i.redd.it/shu3p1cshi601.jpg
Thanks! I mean I look at it like, I'm not down money and I didn't mortgage a house to buy in at $19,000 and then panic sell at $13,000. I'm sure way more people have it worse than me, there are probably dozens of stories like mine or worse, I just happened to tweet about it in 2011 with a #bitcoin hashtag.;3;1;False;gregschoen;drw08k2;What he would be wishing now? ðŸ˜‚;7mgy26;https://i.redd.it/shu3p1cshi601.jpg

Based on that math. Today btc would have around 0.2% of that money. It would be easy to check.

Youâ€™re attitude is awesome man, and Iâ€™m right there with you. I bought, sent and sold so much BTC through 2014-2016 that Iâ€™m embarrassed to tell anyone. But now I just HODL a little bit and it makes me feel alright. Our initial faith and commitment to Bitcoin is a big reason why it is where it is. ;3;1;False;rezilient;drvzmwf;What he would be wishing now? ðŸ˜‚;7mgy26;https://i.redd.it/shu3p1cshi601.jpg
It doesnt suck. I mined a fair amount of bitcoin back in the day. I spent the bitcoin at places that accepted bitcoin. The way I look at it is that people like you and me kept the ecosystem alive to get to where it is now. If I would have have just held all of my coins what good does that do growing the bitcoin economy?

Greetings, The Green Lake Conservancy in Green Lake, WI needs your support to preserve 40 acres of undeveloped land along Green Lakeâ€™s shoreline. Green Lake, WI is a natural beauty and one of the deepest spring fed lakes in the United States.  This heavily-wooded property, operated for over 50 years as Camp Grow, sits on Green Lakeâ€™s unspoiled south shore in Dickinson Bay and borders Spring Lakeâ€™s naturally rich shoreline. Sponsorship of the Green Lake Conservancyâ€™s Partnership for Preservation means you are joining a select group of local donors who want to prevent development of this last existing shoreline on Green Lake that will EVER be available to protect.  Local residents are trying to come up with $1M to purchase the land and seek another $1M in a Wisconsin DNR Grant.  Today, from my understanding they are $200K short.  This parcel is critical for the Conservancy as it allows all people to experience Green Lakes beauty by permitting open access versus property development (large residential homes).  From  a watershed conservation, protecting every acre of Green Lakeâ€™s watershed from damaging nutrient and soil runoff is critical to itâ€™s water quality. The riparian characteristics (land between two bodies of water) make this property especially unique. It helps control nonpoint source pollution by holding and using nutrients and reducing sediment to both Green Lake and Spring Lake. The unique contour of this land also makes it highly vulnerable to severe alteration if it is developed. It is crucial that these bodies of water are protected from development that would have adverse effects on water quality. The property also contains several authenticated ancient Native American Mounds that need to be protected.  Following is a link, I've donated what I could, here is the conservancy link for others.  The town has until 12/31 to come up with pledged funding.  Thanks to all that can support.  Following is the conservancy webpage.  http://www.greenlakeconservancy.org/news/partnership-for-preservation







TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE!

We need your pledge by December 31st, 2017 in order to protect this property so it can continue to serve its environmental purpose for perpetuity. A recent appraisal placed a value of  $4 million on the property. We have applied for a grant under the Wisconsin DNR's Knowles - Nelson Stewardship program. If successful, this grant would be limited to 50% of appraised value, leaving as much as $2 million to be pledged by local supporters. This is your opportunity to create a lasting legacy for many generations to come. Pledge your support before December 31st!
