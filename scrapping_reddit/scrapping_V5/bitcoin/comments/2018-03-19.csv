"Silk road was shut down in October, reopened and then shut finally on the 6th of November 2013.

On the 6th of November, the price was $253. The price didn't peak until December 4th at $1147. 

It didn't drop below $253 until January 2015. It was above the price when silk road shut down for all of that time.
