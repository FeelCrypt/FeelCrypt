"Wouldn't say I know 100%.

I was kind of shocked? By the $3 sell, $1-2 buy fee from Coinbase. With the trading the minerfee usually is like 0.01 which I'm not sure what unit that is (time to go read) anyway thanks for your time. I'll look into this more, I have currently cashed out majority of my ""holdings"". At a loss though like $30 sucks.

I did buy on that dip when BTC went back down to ~<$6K but not that much";1;0;False;crespo_modesto;dv8x2uo;When you are trying to buy the dip;81qkxp;https://v.redd.it/14187bzhakj01
"Thank you always for responding to me Oapie. Is that your name?  
I'm just gonna hold onto all my coins for now and see what happens. I think once BTC moves up, the rest of alts will follow in next 4-6 wks.  Hopefully that will happen..... Haha.  Do you participate in any ICOs?  What are you mostly focused on these days when the market is still going through corrections?
