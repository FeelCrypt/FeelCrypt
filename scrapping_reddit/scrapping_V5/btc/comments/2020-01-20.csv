"*Admittedly this doesn't count as a merchant, but it's a pretty significant bit of adoption so I figured I'd share it.*

Cryptocurrency company [Mecon Cash](http://meconcash.com/index_en.html) has integrated BCH into its payments platform M.Pay following a cooperation agreement with Bitcoin.com. The platform is connected to one of the biggest providers of ATMs in South Korea, so Bitcoin Cash can now be used to withdraw Korean won in more than 13,000 ATMs in South Korea.

"The US government views cryptocurrency as property. Every time you trade it for something, you owe money on the capital gains. For example, if you buy $100 worth of BCH at $100 per coin, then it goes up to $300 per coin, you will owe capital gains taxes on that $200 profit if you were to trade it for something else (spend it as payment). If you bought $300 worth of food at the store, you would have to pay capital gains taxes on that $200 of gain. The same is true, even if you buy a cup of coffee for $3. $2 would be have to be reported and taxed at capital gains rates.

However, what this bill would do, is exclude all personal transactions in which the person gained $200 or less in profit at the time they spent it. So in the above analogy, the $300 purchase at the grocery store, and the $3 cup of coffee, would both not have to be reported and taxed, because each transaction did not have more than $200 in profit.

"Hard to pick one fatal flaw among many.

The LN is a terrible payment system, even worse than raw crypto.  It saves fees only if run on BTC, because of BTC's intentional congestion.  It is fast only if compared to bitcoin; a vanilla crypto with the bitcoin protocol but 6 blocks per minute (instead of 6 per hour) would probably be faster than finding and negotiating a 10-hop LN payment.  Its protection against fraudulent (or accidentally wrong) closure is imperfect and complicated.  It does not allow sending payments to someone who is offline.  Payments cannot be reversed.  It requires locking up one's coins into multiple channels, and it may take days to transfer funds from one channel to another -- in particular, if the other side is unresponsive.  Any node serving as hub would need a Money Service license and would have to comply with KYC/AML laws.  And it cannot scale to millions of users, unless it is centralized into a single big hub and every user has a single channel to it.

Perhaps the last one is the worst flaw, given its stated goal.  If the LN is to be centralized, then should be compared to Visa , PayPal, ApplePay, AliPay, etc (or even to the late Liberty Reserve) -- and then it will lose badly.";4;0;False;jstolfi;ff26uo1;what is the worst thing about lightning network?;er4yqu;/r/btc/comments/a4o427/what_is_the_worst_thing_about_lightning_network/
"This. Also LN doesn't work (70% chance your transaction completes), it's complicated as fuck to use (requires a 24/7/365 node to run to receive payments), it's insecure, prone to lock-ups and penalties, the spec is incomplete, and it reduces BTC liquidity. 

Maybe you don't know this, but Blockstream knew that Lightning would never work. They just wanted time to implement Liquid, their commercial product that works as a second layer on top of BTC.

The main reasoning, I'm guessing, is that many people will be hurt by things they've committed to the blockchain. The blockchain is forever.

Some examples of this would be:

>""X & Y forever!"" (Five years later X & Y break up.)

>""I completely reject and will never be led by machines."" (20 years later, skynet becomes active, killing all in opposition.)

">Elaborate please?

The IRS [changed tax forms](https://www.forbes.com/sites/shehanchandrasekera/2019/12/20/cryptocurrency-question-on-irs-schedule-1-part-1-of-6/#5d388178673a) to include asking if American citizens own cryptocurrency. Any American 'playing by the rules' filing taxes will therefore need to indicate, under penalty of perjury (by signing the form), when they own cryptocurrency. 

Without this legislation passing such people would be exposed to onerous tax keeping requirements whenever they used cryptocurrency, whether purchasing things online via BitPay, or eating at a newly onboarded Cafe and using crypto. They would need to document *every purchase*, even a $5 cup of coffee. Come tax time they would then need to calculate capital gains and losses on *all* purchases made throughout the year. That's because cryptocurrency is viewed as 'property' by the IRS. So it's equivalent to trading one's physical possessions in commerce (bartering), instead of being treated like currency.

Anyone failing such documentation and submitting required paperwork would be in trouble with the IRS, and cryptocurrency transactions can often leave a trail. So the easiest thing for Average Joe law abiding citizens would be not *using* cryptocurrency at all, maybe just holding it. The only alternative would be not filing tax paperwork at all (which is a strategy many tax protesters do successfully use).

With the $200 threshold, however, a person could truthfully say they do hold cryptocurrency, but if asked why they didn't submit any transactions documentation the answer could be ""I never bought anything over $200"". That's an effective 'out' because now the onus is on the government to try to prove that's false, which is far more difficult than simply proving *any* purchase occurred at all.";10;4;False;cryptos4pz;ff1k8sc;U.S. Congress proposing to exclude cryptocurrency transactions worth less than $200 from the tax base;er3gsb;https://coinworld360.com/u-s-congress-proposes-to-free-small-cryptocurrency-transactions-from-taxes/

Anyway Peter mentioned he got in trouble with the IRS, which is unusual because he, unlike [his father](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irwin_Schiff) who died in jail protesting the government, complies with the tax system.

One year he forgot to file a single form. He had put a house in a trust for his kid and forgot to file the correct tax form, or at least his accountant did. The IRS fined him $200,000! He wasn't evading taxes and the property showed up elsewhere too if I recall, but it was a simple honest mistake, a clerical error. Anyway when he got the news he asked his tax lawyer if he'd heard of the 8th Amendment. Here is the text:

*Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.*

Peter said if a $200,000 fine for not filing a single form wasn't an example of an excessive fine in violation of the 8th Amendment he didn't know what was. So he wrote back to the IRS and said he'd keep listeners updated. He said he didn't want to but was prepared to fight the matter up to the Supreme Court if needed, noting that if he was successful it would be a win for all Americans because it would set precedent and relieve them similarly.

There is no such law that stops fraud. That doesnt make tyranny good. If the law as written were actually followed to the T it will effectively regulate cryptos usage out of existence.

The burden on the state to uniformly enforce such a law or the individual to follow such a law is immense, and it is not feasible for either. Its still not really feasible at the 200 dollar limit either, but it does eliminate many transactions.

Irwin Allen Schiff (; February 23, 1928 ‚Äì October 16, 2015) was an American libertarian and tax resistance advocate  known for writing and promoting literature in which he argued that the income tax in the United States is illegal and unconstitutional. Judges in several civil and criminal cases ruled in favor of the federal government and against Schiff. As a result of these judicial rulings Schiff was in a hospital prison serving a sentence of 162 months (13.5 years) at the time of his death at the age of 87. The Federal Bureau of Prisons reported that Schiff died on October 16, 2015.Schiff is the father of businessman and former United States Senate candidate Peter Schiff.

And

$4 x long term capital gains tax rate on the four dollars of gain from spending my crypto. (15%).

For a total of 6.10 for my 5 dollar burger.

The .50 cent sales tax would be collected and remitted by the store, but id have to keep up with the .60 cent capital gains tax all year. I'd have to do this on every transaction i made. And keep track of every crypto purchase i made.

"> The draft law notes: Cryptocurrency transactions due to changes in exchange rates should not be included in an individual‚Äôs income. **The previous sentence does not apply if the profit exceeds $200.**

Wait, this is much better. This means it's not a $200 transaction limit. It's a $200  capital gains limit. So if something costs $5000, and the price difference in cryptocurrency from the time you bought it to the time you are spending it is only resulting in a $150 profit, then that $5000 transaction is excluded from reporting.

That's true of *some* of them I won't deny. Some are just trying to amplify 'white supremacy' which the vast majority of mainstream Americans, of any political persuasion, don't agree with, including President Trump. [Trump is not a racist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaZZbg-BInc&feature=youtu.be&t=2225). 

The *fringe* militia types you'll hear about mostly now are just exploiting the opportunity, and hiding under the cover of constitutional correctness and patriotism to attempt advancing their own fringe and dying 'white supremacist' ideology. But let the 2nd Amendment come under *serious* assault. That's when you'd see *real* militias crop up, I'm talking people who are now in roles like police officers and sheriffs, and business people and more; those would be the people resisting tyrannical government, and that's how it's meant to be.";1;1;False;cryptos4pz;ff1n7xr;I hope it will take a while until the BCH community will be as flooded with statists as the BTC community [see comments].

"> but Trump himself has repeatedly blatantly violated the constitution. are the militia people complaining about that?

Good question. I'll explain. The system of checks and balances isn't perfect. The 2nd Amendment is just *one* check in the system. The Supreme Court and overall [Separation of Powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers) are another check in the system. Should one part fail, another part picks up the slack. Some abuses by government, however, do slip through, which can't be helped. If you and I are in a verbal argument and you shove me I might not retaliate, because ultimately I don't want to fight you, even if I feel I can win. If you shove me 3 times I still might not retaliate, but there is more danger of it than the first shove. If you rape the women in my family and burn down my house you'd better believe I probably won't rest until I kill you. See the difference? Different levels of abuse elicit different responses. Some abuses are tolerable, given people usually prefer peace, some are not. If people lose their complete ability to resist an out of control government, by being disarmed, that's the end of the game; the government can do anything it wants as we've seen happen various places in the world over time.

"> Probably for good reason since without social contract, you are free but you also have no rights whatsoever.

I agree. Freedom of everyone propelled by law instead of freedom of the few by absence of law.

But, most governments also misuse the wealth they're entrusted with. E.g. intergenerational contracts are mostly fundamentally broken (except for oil producing countries, Norway, or those ripping off the rest of the world, Swiss). Savings don't match the ageing structure of the population in the first place and the money is misused to make ends meet.

I do understand how people jump to the conclusion tax should be abandoned even if I don't agree.

"**Executive Order 6102**

Executive Order 6102 is a United States presidential executive order signed on April 5, 1933, by President Franklin D. Roosevelt ""forbidding the hoarding of gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates within the continental United States"".  The order was made under the authority of the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917, as amended by the Emergency Banking Act the previous month.

The limitation on gold ownership in the U.S. was repealed after President Gerald Ford signed a bill legalizing private ownership of gold coins, bars and certificates by an act of Congress codified in Pub.L. 93‚Äì373 which went into effect December 31, 1974.

What author said is clear:

*""Wright had previously said, under oath, that an ‚Äúencrypted file‚Äù exists, containing both the list of public addresses and private keys. Many took that to mean that when a courier arrived Tuesday with a file, that at last Wright had received the private keys.""*

He doesn't say that file arrived, but he said that many believed that file arrived. But to be fair, it doesn't matter was it file or password, slice or anything else needed to decrypt the file. End result is the same and all you are doing is grasping on last hope that you are right. You are not right though. 



>It was not the encrypted file which was delivered but the key slices to decrypt the encrypted file.

Ok, fine, it can be even bottle with a note inside. It doesn't matter as CSW supposedly received information needed to decrypt encrypted file that contains public and priv keys.

 >Craig Wright already had the encrypted file. Do you see now?

Do I see what? That you are desperate as I can see through all your cloudy explanations? Come on, that is really poor from your side.

   >> Dude, seriously. Don't waste my time. You have no clue what you are saying

>No just look at points one and two. This is what was said in court all along. He had the file. He even had most of the key slices. He received more key slice/s which enabled him to decrypt the file and give the public keys to the court.

Your point one and two are leading mercifully to the same outcome that Craig is a liar that is losing his way in ocean of lies. It very very obvious.

>Do you see now?

Of course. Plain and clear.

>If you had in fact read the court documents you would have known that it was the key slices to decrypt the file that were needed.

All I see is that you are yourself in a way backpedaling. Whether CSW received slice or file is not relevant from case point of view. End result is exactly the same.

No just look at points one and two. This is what was said in court all along.  He had the file. He even had most of the key slices. He received more key slice/s which enabled him to decrypt the file and give the public keys to the court.

Do you see now?

It literally states that encrypted file contains public keys with corresponding private keys of mined bitcoin that are in tulip trust I. 

How did I misread that?

Craig stated he will get information needed to decrypt encrypted file containing public and priv keys.

I do not take anything somebody wrote without my own critique of it. Of course, if you are saying that author is lying about Craigs lawyer, then ok, I am being lied to as well.

>>Your point one and two are leading mercifully to the same outcome that Craig is a liar

>What is the lie he told in this case?


Here is Craigs declaration:

>(23). Access to the encrypted file that contains the public addresses and their associated private keys to the Bitcoin that I mined, requires myself and a combination of trustees referenced in Tulip Trust I to unlock based on a Shamir scheme.

If CSW lawyer said that he (CSW) hasn't got priv keys after receiving information/slices/file from courier, that implies CSW is guilty of perjury. I am looking forward to CSW explanation on that. Probably some fantasy on tulip trust number 2768768 that will be delivered in 3028.

>>Author was 100% accurate in his article and your attempts to divert are pathetic

>Author was not accurate when he said it was the encrypted file that was delivered. The same point you agreed with him on though now you are backtracking

I am not backtracking and author was right. Read the article:

*Wright filed a statement in the Southern District of Florida late Tuesday asserting that he had received information to unlock an encrypted file of thousands of public Bitcoin addresses that he claims to own. Wright had previously said, under oath, that an ‚Äúencrypted file‚Äù exists, containing both the list of public addresses and private keys. Many took that to mean that when a courier arrived Tuesday with a file, that at last Wright had received the private keys.*

>>Whether CSW received slice or file is not relevant from case point of view.

>It's relevant because both you and the author and Roger Ver thought that it was the encrypted file that was delivered, and more errors flow from that.

No. No errors come from that as author said clearly that **information** was delivered. I personally don't care whether it was slice/password/file or anything as this is absolutely irrelevant. You are only using it to divert. You are fixating on term ""file"" just like you are fixating on Roger, but it all doesn't matter at all.

What is important is that Criag said he is waiting for courier to get access to public and priv keys. Now his lawyer said there are no priv keys and CSW is back-pedalling in his articles.

Personally, I do not even believe there was any courier as nothing here makes any sense. It is just another lie from Craig.

Discussion with you inspired me to write everything down and make my own article about it as level of your delusion and diversion warrants attention.

 >>I DID and I am not following anybody.

>Well how did you all get the same point wrong?

Maybe we did all get the same point right?

>And why do you uncritically accept anything that author wrote? You are following him
