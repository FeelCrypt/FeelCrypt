Right, if everyone does it together, then no new 0-conf security vector is introduced.  And this is a good thing.  But the only way we can _ensure_ that everyone makes the change together is to make it a consensus rule, which then restricts permissionless innovation.   /u/gandrewstone's point is that 0-conf and permissionless innovation are always sort at odd's with each other and a solution that perfectly solves one will necessarily imperfectly solve the other.

Given demonstrations that even fundamental parameters like the currency supply can be modified via a soft consensus fork, there appears to be no upper limit to the scope of changes that can be effected through this style of fork.

Bitcoin is scarce because you cannot make any more of it beyond the 21M supply limit. If you could make more of it, then it wouldn't be scarce. To confirm scarcity you need a way to differentiate authentic coins from counterfeits. The mechanism within Bitcoin for verifying whether a transaction contains authentic bitcoin or not is hashrate, or proof of work. Any transaction attempting to spend bitcoin which is not in agreement with a majority of the Bitcoin hashrate is not actually spending bitcoin, and thus does not represent the transfer of a scarce asset. Without proof of work Bitcoin could not exist. Some people don't realize this and choose to transact with provably inauthentic bitcoin on minority chains which are in disagreement with a majority of POW. Many of these coins such as BCH have great usability, great transaction throughput, and great utility overall. What they do not have however, is scarcity. The only way to imagine that a coin such as BCH had scarcity, would be to deny the system of proof of work entirely and attribute the property 'bitcoin' to minority hash BCH tokens as well. To do this would be to accept that the supply limit has now been functionally increased to 42M 'bitcoin' tokens. The logic follows that if BCH is considered 'bitcoin' then so must (m)any other minority hashpower chains. This means that effectively the coin supply limit has been removed all together and there is no upper bound on the number of tokens which can be considered 'bitcoin'. This approach would of course destroy the number one value proposition of Bitcoin which is its concept of digital scarcity, which was the basis of the entire invention in the first place. Luckily for us this isn't the case and hashrate exists to easily confirm which bitcoin tokens are authentic, and that the 21M limit is still firmly in place. There is only one Bitcoin network as defined by hashrate, and it is the only blockchain which provides genuine digital scarcity.;-4;1;False;shazvaz;fe9tfc8;There is no need for something that is purely “digital gold” when digital cash is also provably scarce.;eo6qq2;https://twitter.com/rogerkver/status/1216765379126558720?s=21

"Let's represent the entire economy as a pyramid. The height is the value of transactions. The width is the number of transactions of that type. Each network can accommodate an area of the pyramid based on security, which is derived from price and block reward.

With its limited block size and projected fee market, BTC has a rhombus shape within the pyramid. When price goes up, the rhombus goes up because security increased. This attracts early adopters of upper levels and grows its mid level, but now there isn't enough block space, so lower levels are kicked out. This rhombus fits with the top of the pyramid and moves up like an elevator without anything supporting it. This is the end goal, to reach the top first and be entrenched in a way that makes it irreplaceable. 

BCH remains in contact with the ground by vowing to never exclude low value transactions. The only way to increase security is to keep on adding transactions, which is done by widening the base. The pyramid within the pyramid can then grow. However, it takes an increasingly wider base to go up each level. Since high value transactions are not interested in a low security network, fiat influx is low and price goes up more slowly.

If all goes well and BTC can keep going up, then it reaches the top with minimal investment. If it doesn't, it falls. When they intersect, low value users of BTC will find it more profitable to switch because interacting with a large userbase is more valuable than security for them. This lowers fee pressure, which lowers security and makes BTC rhombus falls down further, until it's all absorbed and there isn't any point in using it anymore.

If BCH cannot grow horizontally fast enough, then it never catches up to BTC to erode its fee market. If there's some technical limitation that prevents the block from forever increasing, then BCH will also turn unti a rhombus, although a much bigger one. The flippening would happen in the very far future, so I wouldn't bet on it.

We're back in the 2015-2016 era since BTC flew off with high value users that came in 2017-2018. This is already better than after the fork when BCH was overpriced for a network that barely had any usage.

For example, in the ongoing drama between him and BitcoinABC, I have found myself being less sympathetic toward his plea to raise the chained tx limit because his recent moves have shown more self-interest than altruism.  I don't begrudge anyone who acts in their own self-interest, but the chained tx limit being 25 already seems fine to me for most use cases, it was put in place to prevent attacks, and I worry that Roger is making short-sighted decisions in that case similar to the decision to list HEX.;4;2;False;gotamd;fe8zevk;What do yu think about HEX being added to bitcoin.com exchange?

"I don't care about it as much as people think. If Roger says, ""I have reasons."" Or ""I prefer not to explain my decision."", I am totally ok with it and I won't probe.

On the other hand, knowing that HEX had already exit scammed, and telling me it is not a scam, personally I feel like someone is talking down to me as if I am an idiot. I don't know about you guys but I certainly don't like to be treated that way. I mean, if I reverse the situation and I do the same thing to Roger, I think he won't like it too.

I hope it is just down to miscommunication problem or simply a misunderstanding. We are in the same team. I don't have anything against Roger.

When he did Dev fund raiser

Put the massive weight of his company fully behind BCH

"> Listing HEX has made you question his intentions?

Yes, that's what I said.

Those were and are all great, and I applaud him for those things.

> Is there a possibility you are just caught up on the drama?

You asked a question with this post.  I provided my response.  I don't think that is ""caught up in the drama"" unless you demand that everyone share your opinion when you ask a question.

> His actions and talk speak louder than anyone in the community.

Do you recall when BCH launched and SegWit2X was still on the table?  I do, because I was a huge SegWit2X supporter, along with Roger.  Neither of us strongly supported BCH until *after* the SegWit2X defection.  As it turns out, we were both unable to see the way things would work out.  Amaury, who led the BCH fork with ABC, did.  So, I would say that his actions and the actions of other ABC contributors are the reason why there is a BCH community in the first place.  It's ok to think Roger has done and continues to do some great things while also thinking he has made some mistakes.

"What I think would be better is to create highlight groups for people that vote the same way.

Let's say you, A, upvote lots of things that B also upvotes. Then when A posts something, that will be brought higher in your queue to the extent that you have upvoted B on that kind of thing, say flowers.

That is, B's posts get a boost when posting flowers because you and B have often upvoted the same flower-based posts. And if B liked a post, it gets boosted for you because you're probably going to like it too since you guys agree so much.

Obvious statistical correlation here. And it can be done with many more than two people.

The same works on the other side. Something you downvote that another guy upvotes creates a negative correlation. If C likes something, you typically dislike it, so that gets pushed down the page *for you and you alone*.

A moderator for a public channel are inherently seen as centralized: your choice makes a change for the rest of the world.

Whereas a decentralized way means that your choices have no effect on what others see or are able to produce/consume.

Well he doesn't get into implementation details, but this is enough for me to recommend it! At least we have the first functionality of a decentralized moderation system, choice of mods! I applaud the creator.

Next up should be the ability to choose a mod team led by a specific person. The lead mod should have power over the other mods just like Reddit currently does, and you select the mods as a team, possibly with a team name.

The great thing about this is it actually allows mod teams to reshuffle mod hierarchy when they don't like the head mod by creating a new team.

You also have to watch out for who the default team is. I suggest that the default mod be 'no mod' just an unfiltered stream from that sub.

Lastly is discoverability. A user must be able to see what mod teams are popular. They should be able to see how many people have subscribed to this or that mod team. And they should see a statement from the mod teams about what they are all about so people can judge.

"I'm responding to YOUR comments not ABC's.  You seem to be claiming that 25 is somehow a magic number, yet I'll bet that ABC as a good faith move could simply bump the number a bit with no other code changes, similar to how Core could have bumped the block size from 1 to 2 MB with no other changes.

BU has implemented a solution, ported it into the ABC code base, and provided ABC with the location of that port.  We are a development team, not philanthropists (and actually the use of our funds is constrained in various ways that I won't get into here).  More importantly, ""Solving"" this specific problem by throwing money at ABC won't solve the real problems that have gotten us where we are today at 3.2% of BTC.  Specifically, ABC's inability or lack of desire to be responsive to requests from the people and companies actually using BCH on a daily basis, and instead pursuing a variety of other changes and cleanups, irrespective of community feedback, that has created a lot of work for very little end-user impact.";1;1;False;gandrewstone;fe9kuj1;Amaury Séchet - Clearing the Way for Cooperation;enx87f;https://read.cash/@deadalnix/clearing-the-way-for-cooperation-0c92c115
"State programs (as opposed to free market businesses) are generally set up to 1) collect resources toward a goal then 2) achieve the goal. The assumption is that if resources are given, then the program will produce. Unfortunately having already been paid, there is no financial incentive to achieve the goal. The people paying must *trust* that the goal will be achieved. Often if the state program falls short of the goal, it is said that the program does not have enough resources. If this is catered to, people literally pay for failure to produce, and failure is thus incentivized. As history shows, a state program may work, but it is necessarily not because of financial incentives from the fund already collected, because they're not there. It's maybe because of social consequences, or future program aspirations, or the people working for the program's tenacity, ego, personal goals, sense of duty... Not financial incentives from the funds already collected.

So in terms of BitcoinABC... I love them and I donated to the fund last year (justifying it as ""services rendered"" for enabling the blocksize cap increase, as I recognized the fund was set up as described above and had no strings attached). But the funding can be set up much better. MUCH better. Paying in advance botches free market incentives, leaving no financial consequences if the goal is not met. There might not even be a goal, or a contract, or an understanding of intention. This is why the funding is scarce. How is Coinbase to know the money they invest in protocol development will benefit them? They would have to ""trust"" the recipient. Who do they even give it to? I'm not surprised institutions like them are not contributing significantly to funds. There's no way to do it at the moment that keeps financial incentives intact.

The only way I can see the free market working for protocol development is bounties. Produce first, and then harvest a bounty. This aligns the incentives, and does not reward failure like in government programs. SatoshiDice attempted this by offering a bounty for increasing the 25tx limit on unconfirmed, chained transactions. They got results from BU, but have they paid the bounty? Does it even qualify? Their bounty wasn't water-tight, the solution provided wasn't clear-cut perfect... That was the closest I've seen to the free-market funding specific results it wants from full node implementations, though. I think that's close to the answer, and we should work from the customer end backward to solve funding. The customer decides what they want, and they will definitely pay for it.";2;1;False;melllllll;fe9u3tv;Amaury Séchet - Clearing the Way for Cooperation;enx87f;https://read.cash/@deadalnix/clearing-the-way-for-cooperation-0c92c115

"> Isn't there a way to test what BU has done. Where are the public tests?

Yes, but it's not that simple. BU's position is a spec isn't needed as it's a simple, compartmentalized feature. The code is the spec. That's true but only to an extent. Yes, code can be a spec. We've been operating both BTC and BCH essentially this way from the start! That's why everyone is so enthusiastic about what Josh Green of BitcoinVerde is doing by tackling making an actual accurate, up to date specification for Bitcoin Cash, which I'll note BitcoinUnlimited is not only in favor of, but funding! So BU does see the value in having a specification. It's not that progress can't be made without one, it's that it makes any devs job so much easier since they don't have to first figure out what is supposed to be what before making new plans then building and testing further.

As I tried to illustrate the chained tx issue can be as simple or deep as one makes it. Sure, one can just say ah to hell with it, let's just raise the number and hope for the best! If this opens up an attack vector we'll know after we're attacked! Transactions can be simple. Transactions can be complex. The issue isn't fixed but dynamic, and as I described it's linked to every other part of the system, including using consensus forming methodologies that are not even yet fully developed and understood for efficacy, like Avalanche. To do the job right can be quite an undertaking. 

Meanwhile there are existing network problems to address. The new difficulty adjustment algorithm (DAA) which was created shortly after BCH forked, to address the problem of lopsided hashrate for SHA256 based coins like BTC/BCH is basically useless. We've recently seen it being exploited at will by massive hashrate mining several blocks, nearly simultaneously, in succession at will and further this previously unknown hashrate is now believed to be sourced from a known enemy/competitor to the BCH network which has attacked both technically and in the real world with resources before (nChain/CoinGeek). That's a problem. How big a problem is less clear. So things like the DAA may have to be reworked. 

At the same time we have devs like Tobias Ruck, seemingly blissfully ignorant of technical problems that can impact the BCH network with varying severity, who instead of pitching in a hand to help work on what would seem to be obvious priorities, like reviewing Avalanche, or brainstorming a fix for the lopsided hashrate threat hanging over BCH, or tackling code to move us past network breakdown for anything over ~25MB blocks, want to make the whole network *more complex* and subject to who knows what new attack vectors and potentially show stopping operational capacity (ala Ethereum being brought to its knees by a cat picture game) by jumping to a new transaction type supporting powerful new scripting capability and its accompanying resource demands, effectively turning BCH into a different version of Ethereum, which was never Bitcoin's original purpose.

Then we have the issue of just dealing with maintenance and regular updates and improvements to the existing code. All of this ultimately falls on the shoulders of anyone stepping up to the leadership plate, as Amaury has done. At the end of the day everyone will say the buck stops with him. If something goes wrong on the BCH network people will say, well why didn't the leadership (Amaury) see that coming? Address that?! It's always easy to critique from the sidelines and after the fact. We ask Amaury to do all this with no official funding source or technical resources cache. We just say, figure it out and get it all done. We'll know your job was done right if nobody complains (but while also showing little financial gratitude).

So, to answer your question about BU the truth probably lies somewhere in the middle. A specification isn't a show stopper per se. The issue is more that Amaury could use more information, and ideally time and resources to properly take on the new functionality, to do the job right. This is where dev cooperation between the teams, such as in dev meetings and communication channels, would be priceless. But we don't have that between BU and ABC. So instead we ask for a 'spec' to relay valuable information and leave it at that.

What this process will lead to is spaghetti code and low quality software.

If we want to be global p2p electronic cash system, should we want the entire financial system to be dependent on low quality software? I think not. That would be really scary.

That seems contrary to the post I linked to, since you were being both vague (as to what the problem was) but fairly direct in placing all the blame for the problem at Roger's feet, meaning you were fanning the flames. You now have two individuals that have expressed that you were fanning the flames, one being the target of the flames and another an independent observer (at least I will vehemently proclaim my independent nature), so while it might not have been your intention to fan the flames, you did, IMO, fan the flames.

> I'm 100% invested in Bitcoin Cash,

I don't know if I am going to be able to express my thoughts on this well... bear with me.

The amount or percentage you are invested into Bitcoin Cash is irrelevant, at least to me. I could easily say I am 100% invested in Bitcoin Cash, but that is only true in my heart/soul since I believe it will supplant Bitcoin Core and regain the true designation Bitcoin. But I still retain a small amount of BTC (which I am currently using to support a hobby).

Imagine having funding coming from both ends, and then the bounty end of it gaining traction and attracting even more customer bids, and the bounties available actually guiding the protocol development.

"> 1. I still think the 25 tx limit is one of the biggest road blocks for BCH at the moment.

I want to comment on this because I've seen the issue from multiple sides. The money issue I have no comment on, but for the limit I may have useful insight. It's not so simple as it may appear, where for example it may look to some like 'just change the 25 to 1000' and do not much more.

First a recap on what the limit is. Everyone knows that if Alice pays Bob then Bob pays Sue using those funds the accounting system needs to be sure the Alice->Bob transaction is okay before Sue can be credited. Everyone also knows that in Bitcoin confirmations are what marks a transaction as effectively final. The more confirmations the better, but 1 confirmation is about 10,000 times more secure than 0 confirmations. This isn't to say 0-conf isn't safe for certain tx values. Anyway, the point is BTC and BCH took very different views of how to handle transactions in the range between 0 and 1-conf. Famously, BTC implemented replace by fee (RBF), insisting 0-conf were always inherently insecure. There is also child pays for parent (CPFP) which works a bit differently. Both these mechanisms address tx ordering and priority for inclusion into blocks before a block is found, ie 0-conf or mempool range transactions. I believe the 25 chained tx limit was added by Core (I think when Gavin was leading) as basically a placeholder value to limit an attack vector on disrupting/ddos'ing the mempool. Keep in mind that node software must validate every single transaction, and a single transaction can be quite resource intensive, for example containing burdensome scripts and/or signature checking. When a new tx is dependent on a parent tx which was already found in a block no checks need to be done on the parent since it's definitely valid, but when the parent is in the same state of questionable validity as its child it's easy to see how having no limit on self dependent tx chains provide a DDoS opportunity. Just tie up a node in an endless task trying to figure out txs that reference other txs that also need heavy checks. With the limit we know carnage can't go past 25 txs. The software won't check further.

So 0-conf range txs live in a busy place from a software perspective. The software must guard against attacking resource wasteful txs, weeding out invalid txs for bad scripts, bad signatures, insufficient funds, and in the case of tx chains bad parents, while considering fees; additionally in the case of Core, allowing a RBF tx to reset a cone of txs which may have been just validated back to zero prioritizing the higher fee tx. Child pays for parent similarly influences the inclusion and ordering of a candidate pool of txs.

So the software is guarding from attack, guarding miner fee interests, and upholding network protocol mandates like RBF or CPFP. To this point we're only talking about Core node software. BitcoinABC forked Core node software, and that was the state of things.

Now, Bitcoin Cash has added a different perspective to handling 0-conf range txs. We don't consider 0-conf always insecure, and we're fanatical about network efficiency including the validating and relaying of blocks. We adopted canonical transaction ordering (CTOR), a method for organizing transactions into blocks depending on the transaction ID. Since this rule affects the ordering of transactions all of the foregoing is considered alongside it. 

Additionally, Bitcoin Cash seeks to make 0-conf txs nearly as secure as 1+ confirmation transactions. We're looking at various ways to do this reliably under the heading ""pre-consensus"" where the foremost work to date has been with regard to Avalanche, a fairly complex consensus system which requires a separate PoS based protocol layer. Such a system would also influence, but potentially supplant many of the previously mentioned parameters for tx validation, inclusion and ordering.

Now, we look to Amaury for technical leadership of node software protocol. I think it's safe to say we all agree on that. This means it ultimately falls to him to, starting with the existing Core node codebase as described, come up with a new plan for raising the 25 chained tx limit, which doesn't significantly also open too much wider an attack vector. That's job one. Additionally, this must be done while undoing anything RBF related, potentially keeping items CPFP related, and also considering the impacts of CTOR. On top of that, all of this work may be influenced or even completely upended once we settle on a proven methodology for strengthening 0-conf txs. This is in addition to whatever else is going on related to node software, the network and the community. I understand full well this is the workload that stares any tech leader in the face. Hopefully now others do too.

Last, I want to touch on BitcoinUnlimited, which I also support, and also remind people CTOR was pretty much the flashpoint issue that caused the BCH/BSV split, yet that was just *one* small point I touched on above. BU has been doing great work and AFAIK they have good financial resources. BU was able to go in and focus on the 25 tx limit with some good early success. I think they said the number they ran up to was in the 500-1K range (but I may be off) for tested significant improvements. IIRC u/gandrewstone had a difference of opinion regarding CTOR, but said it wasn't worth forking over. His view is also that the 25 tx limit is a simple feature that doesn't ""touch any subsystems"" but I think I just showed how it is in fact linked to the entire fundamental protocol. As Amaury puts it there is a ""pipeline"" which starts from entry into the mempool, continues through blocks, and ends with post consensus and things like 51% attacks. All of these things determine whether or not any given tx remains valid, and all txs potentially depend on all other txs. So, yes, every part of the tx handling protocol is central to the system. This is why I side with Amaury when he asks for more clarity or a ""specification"" about what BU has been able to do and see where it may integrate easily or be incompatible with something else in the pipeline. I hope this can help some.";12;2;False;cryptos4pz;fe6e8aq;Amaury Séchet - Clearing the Way for Cooperation;enx87f;https://read.cash/@deadalnix/clearing-the-way-for-cooperation-0c92c115

No contention on your opinion about the 25tx limit or the clerical stuff on how much bitcoindotcom invested where, but your last point caught my eye.

Some would argue that’s exactly what happened with Blockstream. A bunch of protocol developers whipped up a huge pile of funding so they could work on Bitcoin without worrying about their bills or politics. Ultimately that resulted in either:

1. They became detached from the desires and needs of the wider community and more and more certain that their internally agreed path was correct. 

2. They potentially became beholden to the people who provided the funding.

3. Probably a bit of both 1 and 2.

"Your argument is vague; it basically sums up to ""its complicated"" without actually specifying concretely why.  This is an unassailable argument because its non-substantive (and note that it can be used to block ANY feature), AND it suffers from the appeal to authority fallacy.  

This is poor reasoning.  But let me address some of the issues:


BU implemented a solution that allows for CPFP, but the irony is CPFP is not even useful in a BCH context -- CPFP==""child pays for parent"": if the parent's fee is too low a high fee child can pay for that parent.  This feature is only relevant when blocks are full and transactions are competing by fee for block space.  We used to say that BCH would never be in this situation -- we'd bump that block size as demand increased.  IDK if this is still true, but regardless we seem to be years away from filling 32MB whereas the issues caused by the unconf tx limit are affecting UX today.

If ABC does not like our CPFP solution, why not remove CPFP entirely?  I'm afraid the reason is because ABC imagines it MAY be useful in the future.
 
Why is 25 the magic number that works?  Why not 24 or 26?  Where is the spec that describes why 25 was chosen?  You may be hearing echos at this point from our arguments about increasing the block size.  Why was 1MB a magic number, and only that number worked? (hint: it wasn't)

Programmers have a saying that there are only 3 interesting numbers, 0, 1, and many.  We are already in ""many"" land with unconf limits and Peter Tschipper's work has removed the quadratic relationship to ""many"".  As happened with Core with 1MB blocks, we can spend years investigating many possible ""unknown unknowns"", just to have the feature blocked because you can always invent more unknown unknowns.

Would Amaury drive BU into this rathole of justification, with no intention to ever merge the feature, just to waste our time?  Based on his consistent unprofessional commentary about BU on social media and his voting ""for"" BUIP098 (which implemented the SV features into BU) I believe that the answer is ""absolutely"".  Do YOU (the BCH investors) think that this is a valuable use of BU developer's time?

Regardless, BU *IS* doing additional research on this by simulating doublespend attempts in the live BCH network with some nodes running deeper unconfirmed chains using my intelligent forwarding code.  We will see how these experiments turn out -- these features have all been released in 1.7.0.0 as ""experimental"", not as something we recommend everyone to deploy today.

Finally, the transmission acceptance pipeline IS a subsystem, even though its important.  But changes here don't (for example) affect the blockchain, the scripting language, the P2P protocol, and so on.";2;3;False;gandrewstone;fe8qlst;Amaury Séchet - Clearing the Way for Cooperation;enx87f;https://read.cash/@deadalnix/clearing-the-way-for-cooperation-0c92c115

> fact most of the world has dropped a gold standard, which works in favor of ordinary people

Can you actually prove this? The 19th and early 20th century were not stable times when it comes to economics. Without a federal reserve actively working to keep stability, there tended to be a lot of panics and bank runs such as the;

Panic of 1792, 1796, 1819, 1837, 1857, 1873, 1884, 1893, 1896, 1901, 1907

And ofc the Great Depression

It does so, as illustrated, simply because paper can be printed without limit. Are you denying this? I'm saying consider each point individually. You're saying ""Oh!

I'm saying it's more complicated than that. It's a fact most of the world has dropped a gold standard, which works in favor of ordinary people. And this has been the system for *decades*.

"> You’re shifting your arguments. First your claimed the video never once depicted Jews. When I proved that it does, now you’re saying it’s irrelevant, not arguing very honestly...

The video didn't depict Jews. It portrayed a symbol which could be taken to represent a specific family. A symbol isn't a Jew (unless it's the Hebrew star, arguably). Also a family isn't necessarily representative of a Jew. A family is often made up of many strains of lineage, because a husband wife pair are not necessarily the same race. Next, you're the one that claimed the Rothschild's were Jewish. I don't know that you're correct. I've never researched it. Additionally, ""Jewish"" can mean many things. It can mean someone that has adopted that culture and/or religion, but who isn't ethnically a Jew at all, like [Sammy Davis Jr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sammy_Davis_Jr.).

So I stand by my original statement the video never depicted Jews. To do so it would need to be something blatantly obvious, like showing someone with characteristic hairstyle and/or wearing a kippah or yarmulke.

> there tended to be a lot of panics and bank runs

If there were bank runs it's because banks started substituting paper for sound money, i.e., gold just as the video shows. The answer to this was erecting a central or ""king"" bank which would back up smaller regional banks, but then the central bank started doing the exact same thing, substituting paper for gold. The U.S. Federal Reserve in 1913 wasn't anything like the Federal Reserve in 2019. The paper notes it issued were actually redeemable for gold and silver: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_certificate_(United_States)

>And ofc the Great Depression

The Great Depression was caused by the newly created Federal Reserve. The Fed inflated (debased & expanded the currency supply) for WWI which produced a corresponding economic boom which we refer to as the ""roaring twenties"". This boom ended in 1929 with a stock market crash which ushered in the Great Depression. The Fed created the economic bubble which then popped.

>When was the last time we had a panic in your lifetime? You’re spoiled by the stability the fed reserve provides

The only reason the United States has looked relatively stable and wealth inducing in my lifetime is because it was granted the privilege of becoming the world's reserve currency. All nations needed dollars to buy oil, which created the 'petrodollar' something regarded as a thing of value on its own, even though it ceased having any gold backing. Being detached from any precious metal (which is unconstitutional, by the way),  the U.S. government could create as many dollars as it wanted, and the world would shoulder much of that weight. So, yes, such a system has certainly given ordinary American citizens, including myself, an economic advantage comparative to the rest of the world. The problem, however, is that system can't last, because it's all debt based. Creating dollars requires creating debt, and creating debt with corresponding interest requirement is mathematically unsustainable forever. It's no different than a credit card. It works great when the card is newly arrived, but the owner ends up miserable and bankrupt and on the streets when all the incurred debt comes crashing down.

Last, the Bitcoin market is far too shallow at this point to provide any meaningful comparison to anything else. The larger the market, though, the more stability will set in.";1;1;False;cryptos4pz;feah66n;The American Dream;enqn8o;https://youtu.be/IaDt9T7BF38

"What the hell is an ""anarcho socialist""? And why are people voting this up? Don't you realize these two words are as opposite as night and day?!

Anarcho or anarchy basically means no government. It's the recognition of no authority. In other words those who believe most in anarchy believe in the maximum freedom of the individual, because that fits with recognizing no authority. Make sense?

Next, what is socialism? Notice the root of the word: social. In other words socialism is about a *group* of people. Socialism is the belief there is no such thing as an individual when people live together, everything belongs to the *group*. So if 100 people live together and 7 are poor those people are not really poor. The 93 other people are automatically obligated to take care of the 7 poor even if they have no relation to them. They do this by *taxing* the group, erecting a central government, then redistributing the group's wealth (after the gov takes its cut as an independent entity) to the poor. 

So socialism by its very root nature means there *must* be a government. Otherwise, how is the group supposed to take care of the rest of the group? There must be a government to handle that. The deeper someone believes in socialism, by definition means the more they believe in attempting to use government to solve problems for the group. Make sense? That's why socialism is right next to communism on the scale of freedom; it's not very free. Individuals don't have individual rights.

America was founded on a **libertarian** ideology, which is right next to anarchy. At first there was anarchy in America. There were the original 13 colonies that rebelled from Great Britain. When they won their freedom they didn't immediately construct any federal government. There was anarchy. Eventually, however, some people felt there should be some **minimal** government, for example, to protect the free people with a military and establish a court system of justice to protect individuals and their property and natural rights. The Founding Fathers of America, the Framers of the Constitution - Jefferson, Madison, Washington etc. - were therefore not complete anarchists. They were libertarians. They still believed in nearly maximum freedom, but with some bare minimal government just to serve as a sort of glue allowing the free people to grow and thrive. The more free the people are the more they thrive. The less free they are, whether under communism or such large government it's effectively like communism or socialism (e.g., people pay over 50% of their labor in taxes, but the gov ""takes care"" of everybody) the less they thrive. This has been shown to be the case repeatedly throughout world history. Now you know.";6;3;False;cryptos4pz;fe5rxdr;The American Dream;enqn8o;https://youtu.be/IaDt9T7BF38

**Silver certificate (United States)**

Silver certificates are a type of representative money issued between 1878 and 1964 in the United States as part of its circulation of paper currency.  They were produced in response to silver agitation by citizens who were angered by the Fourth Coinage Act, which had effectively placed the United States on a gold standard.  The certificates were initially redeemable for their face value of silver dollar coins and later (for one year – June 24, 1967 to June 24, 1968) in raw silver bullion.  Since 1968 they have been redeemable only in Federal Reserve Notes and are thus obsolete, but still valid legal tender at their face value and thus are still an accepted form of currency.Large-size silver certificates (1878 to 1923) were issued initially in denominations from $10 to $1,000 (in 1878 and 1880) and in 1886 the $1, $2, and $5 were authorized.

"Thing is, when coins are shuffled, you can't tell exactly where they came from. Or, maybe more accurately, all outputs come equally from multiple different places.

KYC isn't really the issue here. If you've gone through KYC and an exchange sees that your coins come from a shuffle transaction involving an address they're trying to blacklist, there's no way for them to know whether you were in control of the blacklisted address, or one of the other addresses involved in the mix. So you personally have plausible deniability.

Of course, exchanges could try to blacklist every address involved in a mix with that blacklisted address, but that would get out of hand very quickly. Coins shuffled with a blacklisted address's coins would soon be shuffled again, and then all those secondary coins would be tainted. Then all of those secondary coins would taint more coins when they are shuffled, and so on. This is an exponentially increasing number of coins becoming tainted, and it could happy very quickly.

With enough mixing going on, it would simply not be viable for any exchange to block ""tainted coins"", because practically all coins will be tainted, and that's a good thing for fungibility.";8;1;False;AD1AD;fe5ps76;Super interesting Bitcoin Cash Fusion Transaction.

"Iraq tried to leave the USD behind but look what happened then.   The US Military conquered them and forced them to use the USD.   Cryptocurrency is fantastic in this regard but i'm afraid that if enough global powers like iraq were to use crypto, then the NSA could just point all their collective computing power at any one network and own it.  Not only would it face a network attack that no crypto network has ever faced before, but military action might actually be taken on the physical layer of the network.
