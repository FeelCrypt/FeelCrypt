"This is merely scratching the surface. Any veteran programmer will tell you how easy it is to set up the code for bots. Just using a RNN, like say https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn can turn up enough semi-logical content to make some hard to automatically detect karma farming. And this isn’t even using anything remotely specialized. The fact is, if I could see myself be able to do this for fun (I am a veteran programmer), then for sure there’s team that are monetarily backed that have done the legwork already. Not that there’s that much to do. You can easily set up some pre-written conversation topics with some minor variations, code some fuzzy search and have bots automatically respond with your propaganda. You could even make the fuzzy search smarter than just regexes; plug in one of the many pre-existing libraries that do NLP. Again, very tough to detect an account that would do that, besides maybe using DNA sequencing algorithms to detect repeated patterns? Like there’s so many ways to do this that it’s not even funny. And soon enough we’ll have so much misinformation that we won’t be able to tell a real conversation from one that isn’t, kind of like r/politics. It’s the new spam of our age. It cost almost nothing to make, and the websites are wholly unequipped to filter it. And like spam, it isn’t that complicated to do.

"Regardless of whether you support Bitcoin (legacy/core) or Bitcoin Cash, if you engage in hacking, bot voting/posting, opportunistic propaganda, you are harming your project. Just don't do it. 

One of the hallmarks of the bitcoin debate on twitter has been fake accounts liking posts (30-50 likes really suddenly by people with accounts that only have 50 or so followers, and just look a bit too obviously trying to be 'normal'), trolling people, and amplifying messages (propaganda). My suspicion is that the same people who engage in this crow about having 'the community' on their side - in other words they have no ethics or credibility and are just toxic people incapable of self reflection. Just don't do this, even if you see the other side doing it.

"Wow, epic, standing ovation! This confirms what we have suspected all along.  The criminal activity associated with Bitcoin Core / Blockstream goes all the way to the top.  If true this means that their CTO Greg Maxwell is at minimum complicit in criminal activity if not directly carrying it out or directing others to do so himself.

I've always been suspicious of the claim that the folks doing illegal things in the name of supporting Core are just some fanatics not directly associated with Core or Blockstream.  While people have been suspicious of Blockstream Core for a while this is the first time there is very direct and compelling evidence implicating Greg Maxwell.  Many of us assumed they were also behind the criminal attacks on XT, Classic, and Unlimited nodes but didn't have any proof.

"If I remember correctly Gregory Maxwell often refers to the ""Bitcoin Core project"" as ""the Bitcoin project"" which is quite unusual. Here's /u/4n4n4 also referring to the Bitcoin Core project as ""the Bitcoin project"" just as if there are no other (competing) node client projects such as Bitcoin Unlimited existing:

Paging u/adam3us, what do you feel about a C-level executive in your company that might be involved in criminal activity that goes against the ethos of the community which you and all other companies within the Bitcoin sphere relies on? Personally, I find this kind of behavior disgraceful and completely unacceptable, and would take above accusation very seriously. If we as a community want to persevere and replace the legacy banking system, we cannot be seen as a bunch of authistic hackers. It is just bad branding.;21;2;False;apocynthion;dq5p2pd;"Evidence that the mods of /r/Bitcoin may have been involved with the hacking and vote manipulation ""attack"" on /r/Bitcoin.";7eil12;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7eil12/evidence_that_the_mods_of_rbitcoin_may_have_been/

"This comment from /u/4n4n4 got the double dash, no space too **and** talk about using the weight discount to favour CT transaction..

>Yup, you got it. Effectively CT would work like segwit is working now; if more people use it, blocks will be larger. Assuming a **lower weight is given to CT**, that **is--it's** still very early in the discussion :)
EDIT: Though as you can see in the code the 1MB limit was actually removed already, but due to how weighting works the data sent to legacy nodes will never exceed their 1MB limit.
