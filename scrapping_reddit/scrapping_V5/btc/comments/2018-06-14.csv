"I agree with your:
> A chocolate chip out of place in the crypto world is a disaster. 

But at the same time you seem to think that most people are retarded. If you spend 1 minute with a newb and say ""There are different coins on the market this one is BTC and this one is BCH you want to buy XXX because its the better one"" they will get it. The number of people that go to a store in Canada and try to pay in Australian dollars is incredibly small. Most stores in Canada will even accept US dollars and the shop staff is smart enough to hit the US$ button on the register and vice versa. Which country has the TRUE dollar? Is the Canadian dollar not a legitimate dollar just because the USA's dollar is more famous or popular? People are able to tell the difference between a nations ""dollars"". People are able to tell the difference between a Playstation 1 2 3 4 disc and an Xbox 1 360 disc.

But that just goes around to my same basic point once again. In my opinion it would be better if the Bitcoin Core dev team, as the reference client, made a 1 time only name change. Bitcoin Original, Bitcoin Zero, Bitcoin Trentw. Whatever makes them happy. I am fully aware it won't happen but it would help alleviate any confusion. The alternative is every other type of bitcoin has to drop bitcoin from their name or a new name will be given to BTC without official approval of the core team. I personally don't care if people say Bitcoin Core, but this whole thread started with me trying to find a name that the BTC camp finds acceptable.  The btc camp has dug its heels in an said NO ONLY WE ARE BITCOIN!

"Welcome back. Took me a minute to review this thread because it was a while ago now.  I once again disagree with you. The established method of software forks is to rename the offshoot. Ok sure. But I disagree with the premise that bitcoin cash is an offshoot. Which is where the confusion comes into play. We can get into the semantics of when the fork occurred, what defines the fork, which chain is more similar based on your definition vs mine vs Roger's vs Tone Vays etc. My whole point is bitcoin is not longer one thing. It is a new TYPE of thing that did not exist before Satoshi brought it into the world. The argument is that the core team has exclusive right to determine what is and is not bitcoin based on their own criteria and what ever may be influencing that vs what is in the whitepaper itself. I don't agree with that at all. Adam and company have possession of the commit access to the original code repository. There is no denying that fact. However everyone has their own opinion on what number of changes it takes until it is no longer is bitcoin. Its that old riddle about workers remaking a train as it goes down the track with all new parts. Is it still the same train? For some people that change would be inflating past 21 million coins. For some people that means breaking the chain like segwit. For some people anything the authority of the core team decrees is still bitcoin. For some people the argument is less technical and more philosophical. Why did Satoshi create bitcoin? Which coin best matches that ideal? Who is to say which point of view is more valid? Many of us have the opinion that bitcoin cash is the closest thing to the original bitcoin that exists in the world today for different criteria than perhaps you and others personally measure. It does not make it less valid. There are a large number of people I am sure that if (with un deniable proof)Satoshi came out today and said ""BCH is the closest thing to my creation"" would just discount it and say... ""ya but we have LN now and it's better.""  You put ""brand"" in quotation marks. But that is the point. There is no registered trademark or brand. So no one has authority to claim it. People in both camps think the name has been hijacked. BTC people think that BCH people are just trying to steal the brand so that they can get rich without producing anything original. BCH supporters think that some less than honest people took control over the bitcoin project years ago and redirected it to be a different thing than it was intended to be. Who is right?

"If I forked bitcoin cash would that also make it both bitcoin cash and bitcoin. Therefore each would be now be obligated to change their original name in order to define itself a child of the higher class; according to your logic. All this in order to avoid confusion.

My point here is not to define what the 'true bitcoin' is, that's another discussion; it is too avoid confussion and ambiguity. An established method in software forks is too rename the forks and original keeps the name. This is a pretty simple process.

But in Bitcoin Cash's case they want to take the 'brand' so convention and simplicity is given a low priority. Bitcoin Cash would be better off owning its own 'bitcoiness' by promoting itself on its own feet. It has a ligitimate method of scaling and should be happy in that fact.

"I think you do not take the time to listen to what I say because I have said several times now in this thread I DO NOT think BCH is the real bitcoin and I also there is no REAL one single bitcoin any longer as bitcoin is now a type of thing. Take cookies for example. I am sure at some point the recipe for ""cookies"" was one thing. But people made other versions of the same type of thing. But from that point on ""cookies"" was a new thing. You are arguing that only 1 group gets to decide what makes an official cookie and everything else needs to have a different name. But I am saying that once cookies were born into the world it makes things easier if they have their own unique names. Butter cookies. Oatmeal cookies. Oatmeal raisin cookies. Chocolate chip cookies. Oreos etc etc. You are saying no, only BTC is Cookies and BCH shouldn't  include ""cookies"" in its name. I am saying no dude they are both cookies and it would be easier if BTC was called... ""Sugar Cookies"" or whatever you want. After that no one needs to change anything when someone creates a new kind of cookie based on that original recipe. You can make Trentw Cookies.

">I’ll look into your feedback regarding XMR.

Thanks, although I'm sure nothing will come of it. The damage has already been done and 'you' have allowed that toxic community to dictate the narrative. Don't think that people who find Dash a good project haven't noticed your sub playing favorites. Of course, we know that this is how the xmr community operates. 

They don't win with the best tech, but with the best lies and biggest voices. So you allowing them to lie and spread their voice with impunity for 1 year and a half (the amount of time I've been subbed to r/crypto and posting there) shows that they weaseled their way into a position of control there too.

Do I need to post how they tried to get coinmarketcap.com to put Dash in a special 'premined' category so it could be called 'a shitcoin'? Its about names, visibility and making false impressions. That's why they trot some guy like you out to give a 'favorable impression' while they continue to act like snakes in the background. Again, I have PERSONALLY dealt with the pro-xmr bias in that sub. 

I posted a thread here in r/btc it got something like 90% upvotes, 1000+views here. Ok? THE SAME thread crossposted in r/cryptocurrency got like 800 views (which is fine) and was like 20% upvoted with all my comments downvoted beyond visibility. The only reason for downvoting is because the thread was about 'xmr'. None of the other threads I made or posts I make get this reaction, only negative ones about Monero. And if the post doesn't explicitly mention monero, the effect is much less. Meanwhile the same thread here gets a massively different response. Why? How? Are the denizens of r/cryptocurrency more battled-hardened crypto veterans than those of r/btc? Given what happened with the fork and in the years that led up to it, I'd say no. 

So its clear that what makes the difference is the monero community vote brigades.
As moderators you would've noticed this early on, the fact that you must've and didn't do anything about it indicates that you are at the least in cahoots/covering for them. Even if not you personally. This is an inescapable conclusion.

Yes they are, that's why you're here. You are an attempt to smooth out and hide their operation. Obviously, if you control moderators and content that is not an idea that you want spreading, so whoever is in control obviously does not like this discussion.

>The hostility in your approach isn’t helping the dialogue between us.

I swear if you victim blame me one more time. The hostility comes from the COMMUNITY THAT YOU SHELTER AND GIVE UNDUE VOICE, sir. This community is not like SIA, or BCH, or Dash, or PIVX. This community is full of FUDDERS liars and scammers. They impersonated Andreas Antonopolous and threw a hissy fit when that user was banned. Fluffy p&d'ed his own community last Aug. The majority of their hashrate is botnets i.e. STOLEN RESOURCES, etc. etc. So for you to say its 'my hostility' is the pot calling the kettle black for sure.

>I should have realised this reading your other comments. 

Yes, you should have. Shilling is oftentimes a hated activity amongst real people. So yes, you coming here to say 'hey hey, everything's fine. There's nobody doing anything wrong over here so just go back to sleeeeeepppp' doesn't really move me at all, I agree.

"The accounts were replaced after there were multiple attempts to doxx the mod team. We replaced our main accounts with new or alt accounts.

There’s no conspiracy here it’s mostly the same team with the exception of new people who have been recruited from the public crypto mod applications

**Edit 1:** mass downvotes for sharing the truth... okay guys.

Yes one account was successfully doxxed & compromised who then used it to place some referral links in the sidebar and we contacted reddit about it. 

**Edit 2:** I’ve been looking through some old ccadmin threads, it’s almost as if we explained that the house clean up and account swap over was going to happen - it seemed best to do both at the same time especially given some of the doxxing events. Not everyone decided to do it either - look at jw’s account.

So this guy - we are satoshi mod is now complaining, accusing the team of suspicious behaviour, he fucking ignored the admin posts over the course of four weeks (four threads) and then we removed the low activity mods from the sub especially those that didn’t respond.

"\>do you also think that climate change is not a thing but a subject worthy of debate?

This comment doesn't make sense as written. I think that the ""blockstream conspiracy"" is more reasonable than climate change denial, but I think that it's unlikely that there's any conspiracy at all. I'm sure Blockstream employees have a *bias*, but to say that they're maliciously hijacking Bitcoin is pretty extreme. All of them were heavily contributing to Bitcoin (for free) long before Blockstream was formed.

Also, we're starting to see results already. BTC had a 1.9 MB block yesterday, and consistently has 1.6MB blocks, at only 45&#37; segwit adoption. I've always been skeptical of LN as a cure\-all, but the speed of progress there has been really impressive. It's also important to remember that increasing the BTC block size is still an option if LN fails, and although we had about two months of high fees, it's not as though BTC died. There's a lot to be said for the conservative approach in something like Bitcoin that needs to be secure above all else.

This is why I wish the two communities would get along. It's perfectly reasonable that segwit \+ 8MB blocks is the solution, yet it almost feels like that's off the table for BTC now. Meanwhile, BCH is doing 32 MB blocks and 0 fee txs \- the latter of which was removed from BTC for very good reason.";1;0;False;KingJulien;e0mttm1;Mods at /r/cryptocurrency have CENSORED the post with 2000 upvotes exposing /r/Bitcoin.;8qqcbr;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8qqcbr/mods_at_rcryptocurrency_have_censored_the_post/

We removed a moderator in the past few months who had a preference for Dash. They approved grey-area Dash posts, censored negative comments, and purged mod notes of Dash-related accounts. We quickly removed the user with an appeals process.

I agree. We have very differing opinions on his “motives”. The thing is that offering money to “address a problem” directly serves his interests. It would significantly raise the reach of his word and posts. He’s not allowed to post there as he’s likely banned. This sub is basically his personal voicebox and he would attempt to make the bitcoin sub his as well. Undoubtedly. Removing the “censorship” from that sub would directly benefit him as it would be another place for him to shitpost and troll. Tho I’m sure u will disagree with most of what I’m saying and that perfectly fine. But I feel this is simply disingenuous as he knows that Reddit will decline as they cannot accept this offer as it would be seen as manipulation plain and simple.

"How am I not rational and how am I not logical? It really seems common sense to me that a sub name should be related to it topic and i dont think i should have to do mental gymnastics to validate why its related as some people here try to do.   

As far as your other argument, the brand ""bitcoin"" does not belong to bch. It belongs to BTC. There is no confusion that btc is the original bitcoin and it is simply referred as ""bitcoin."" It is the original implementation and has always marketed its brand as ""Bitcoin."" It is functionally both a concept and a real product and has its own distinct blockchain.  There is no rule or law or logic that says it must remain the same and to never change over time. This is silly. Every product adapts to its current market requirements to thrive and succeed. Is Apple the same as it was in the beginning? How about MSFT, NFLX, AMZN etc etc. Of course they all have evolved over time and the product changed so the argument that its not as consistent with the white paper is completely stupid. The idea of it being hijacked is also stupid. Every company has employee turnover and every company has people that have more leverage and ability than others to direct its products in a certain direction. There was no hijacking. There was employee turnover and evolution and disagreements of the best move of the product bitcoin. The people who had the most leverage moved it to the direction they thought best. Its silly to think that because they evolved \- they should have to change the name or something. Should they just lose the name? Silly. About decentralization, why do you think Roger V is trying to bribe reddit \- because he is involved with large mining operations of bch and is looking to profit from this move. BCH is highly centralized and RogerV is banking on his power and leverage. One of the moves when bch split was to make bch more asic compliant therefore helping his direct centralization.

The point is perfectly valid that bch wants to return to the whitpapers vision but it is meaningless. So what. Ltc has the same vision. Should ltc be called bitcoin? Preposterous. Same for bch. Btw, btc is not using the brand name to confuse people. Is -is- its name and always has been for approx a decade. When bch forked and split off - nothing changed on the btc side. It remained the same as it ever was so bch has no legitimacy in that it is bitcoin. Because it copied the ledger - it gets to be called a derivative- bitcoin cash and this is fine.

You’re right it is different but not completely. It’s still allowing an outside influence to *influence* how Reddit runs its site. Whether we like it or not this censorship while obvious to some at times is still considered subjective. Personally I agree that it’s a shit show in that sub. But there are sooo many that get banned for legit trolling and make a a big deal about like it was unjust. Which banning does seem unfair but if ur just trolling then there’s no need for u to be there. I don’t frequent that sub cuz of the moderation. But there’s plenty of people that do and enjoy the content. There’s plenty of places to discuss things of importance to me that I don’t need that sub. Ver has this sub and this really is his sub. It’s clear this is simply an agenda driven proposal. Is it coincidence that he constantly talks shit about BTC, posts his petty twitter arguments, and claims that BCH is the true bitcoin coin and his trolling to this sub and it gets eaten up. It’s a targeted proposal.

How so? What do you think a subreddit is? Its a place where one can talk about the topic of the sub in a way that promotes the topic in a positive way without being persecuted or denigrated or brigaded.

If you want to talk about the negative aspects of it then you got to the ironically named sub r/btc. So, you really get all aspects that you want so im not really sure what the problem is on why /bitcoin needs to be opened up. ;0;1;False;jojlo;e0nc7ye;"Roger Ver on Twitter: ""/r/Bitcoin is completely censored and has been for nearly 3 years now.

"So, you think it's wrong that a community wants to recover a brand name that was hijacked by people with their own private agenda and no longer follows the foundational vision that made that brand famous in the first place?

Bitcoin Cash follows the original vision, while Bitcoin is luring new users under false pretense of decentralization.

How is the other side bad? All subs are safespaces. They are not open to all conversation especially about things not related to the topic of the sub. This is what Roger wants to change. He wants unfettered access to /bitcoin so he can brigade it about things not related to btc and disparage btc at every chance he can get. If you don't believe it... just check the ironically names sub \- /btc. ;0;2;False;jojlo;e0n70ry;"Roger Ver on Twitter: ""/r/Bitcoin is completely censored and has been for nearly 3 years now.
