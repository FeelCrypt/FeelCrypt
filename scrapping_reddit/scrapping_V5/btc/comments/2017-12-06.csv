"Having read the press release, I do see this as a very sensible decision, as disappointing as it may be. Steam users have a very high overlap with the current Bitcoin demographic, but currently the cons to accepting it outweigh the pros.

At least Steam does seem to have people on board who understand Bitcoin well enough that they will probably reconsider this decision when new scaling tools come out, or maybe another currency in the interim (perhaps Bitcoin Cash if Bitpay begins accepting it).

I see this as temporary, even though I have to admit it scares me a bit. Bitcoin has to scale.

">BitPay is also planning on adding additional blockchains to their repertoire. By next year, Pair says they will natively support 4-5 additional blockchains, determining which ones by their ability to enable payments and by market cap size. They plan to add their first new cryptocurrency in the next two months. This will help consumers who are moving towards other cryptocurrencies in order to avoid bitcoin’s current high transaction fees.
