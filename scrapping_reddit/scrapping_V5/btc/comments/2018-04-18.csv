"Hey /u/memorydealers

This message would of been better had you offered $100,000 USD to a children's hospital had the community of /r/bitcoin opened up their moderation logs. That's all people need to see - the moderation logs. This would go hand-in-hand with their narrative regarding the ""saving babies"" thing they use to attack you after you owned Samson Maw. You would be offering them the chance to save babies by just demanding their moderators open up the logs.

You could pay every month for 10 months - $10,000. I wouldn't trust sending $100,000 in one go cause then they'd close the logs again before too many people saw the rampant censorship going on.";331;15;False;;dxkqws4;"Roger Ver: ""Dear @reddit, [...] I'll pay you $100,000 USD if you simply appoint a moderator to /r/Bitcoin who supports free speech.""";8d6dtm;https://twitter.com/rogerkver/status/986621892684492800

I'd be interested to know whether you're all still using 2400 kbps modems.  And leading the campaign against high def videos on Youtube.  And arguing against widening roads at city council.  It's fascinating to watch such engineering proficiency in action.  When the 14.4 bps modem came out, you guys were all over that propaganda sub.  Remember the one guy arguing for the 28.8 US Robotics - he was way too aggressive and arrogant.  And the brand confusion was frustrating.  What we need are very narrow roads - that's how we scale.  Everyone can just pay a $3 fee to hop on Elizabeth Stark's back.  /s
