"This is a wholly inaccurate comparison. The reason those aren’t available to anyone besides “qualified” and “accredited” investors has nothing to do with some scheme to keep the high returns among the wealthy. 

The reason is merely a risk management perspective. 

Hedge funds tend to lock up money in quarterly or six month time frames, the manager needs unlimited access to those funds without worry of redemption or the model doesn’t work. If you want a hedge fund invest in a liquid alternative. 

Venture Capital and Private Equity investments lock up money between 7-20 years because that is how long it takes to generate value with a private investment and those investments are illiquid. For that reason most direct investments target institutions (endowments/pensions) with a $1M minimums. Even fund of fund investments have a $100k minimum and they are only available to qualified investors (over $1m in assets or $200k in yearly income) because your average investor can not feasibly park $100k in an investment vehicle that won’t provide liquidity for several years.

Other things you can invest in without permission.

">The top 1% as in the top wealthy individuals, not in terms of salary.

In a way, you could argue it's even easier to get into the top 1% by wealth than by income.

Salaries are distributed very tightly by IQ. Net worth is not. It's all over the place by comparison. So you are, in a sense, less limited by your genes when it comes to net worth than when it comes to salary in practice.

There are many reasons for this. One is that you can inherit money. (Though you may not keep it long if you're really quite dumb.)

Another major reason however, is that you can be a business owner of a tire store or a plumbing supply company or a farm, not have a very high IQ at all, be very good with managing cash flow, and gain a very high net worth if it is of interest to you to do so.

Furthermore, you could be a professor or public school teacher with a very high IQ and have an artificially low net worth because your fortune is tied up in a government pensions that's worth literally millions of dollars at current interest rates, all while you cry poverty.

"**Nixon shock**

The Nixon shock was a series of economic measures undertaken by United States President Richard Nixon in 1971, the most significant of which was the unilateral cancellation of the direct international convertibility of the United States dollar to gold.

While Nixon's actions did not formally abolish the existing Bretton Woods system of international financial exchange, the suspension of one of its key components effectively rendered the Bretton Woods system inoperative. While Nixon publicly stated his intention to resume direct convertibility of the dollar after reforms to the Bretton Woods system had been implemented, all attempts at reform proved unsuccessful. By 1973, the Bretton Woods system was replaced de facto by the current regime based on freely floating fiat currencies.

"> Wealthy will always create wealth faster than the poor. 

Wealth is not what creates wealth, being prosperous is what creates wealth. Yes, having means can make one more prosperous, but being poor does not stop one from working hard, and creating something someone richer than you values. 


>Poor work themselves, capital works for wealthy. 

**This is 100% true of the existing system** those who want more capital can create more money by loaning it into existence just because they already have capital assets. They then buy productive assets that create wealth that they use to pay off the loan. 

The mechanism by which the wealthy get more wealthy is facilitated by fractional reserve banking. It needs fiat money. Remove the mechanism, and you remove the means of getting wealthy with wealth, the only way to make new wealth with hard money is to create things of value.


>Wealth inequality will skyrocket

wealth inequality is caused by taking wealth from the poor and giving it to the rich. 

The mechanism is called the Cantillon Effect: increasing the money supply affects relative inflation, or how a disproportionate rise in prices among different goods in an economy over time, **will benefit those who are first to receive it** and diminish the wealth of those in the economy who have to experience inflation before earning the new money. 

Bitcoin redistributes wealth; the system may start with a disproportionate distribution of wealth, but it will stabilize in a similar way to the way I described it at the beginning of this chat thread.  

Bitcoin is free market those who work and produce value get richer those who don't get poorer. There will always be poor lazy people, Bitcoin gives an opportunity to the poor hard working people one that our western Crony Capitalist system does not give.
