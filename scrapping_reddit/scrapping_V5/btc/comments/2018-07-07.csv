I figured that I might want to take the photograph of the destroyed sticker later on, so I sticked the other sticker next to it. I couldn't take the photograph immediately because it was dark and my dumbphone's camera does not make very good photos in dark. Some other day I was driving past that place with my girlfriend but I was too lazy to get out of the car and check whether the new sticker is still intact, so I commanded my girlfriend to do it for me and she took the photo with her smartphone.

Consider the outcome of more exposure. Less fiat in circulation over time reduces the control by our bank overlords who in turn use their printing press to create war. So a little graffiti with the right message has an everlasting affect. Now stickers of corporate brands that lead to wasteful consumption is polluting to the mind and the world.

"BCH is a hard fork of Bitcoin because BTC forced segregated witness when it was clearly a bad idea and without community support. To preserve the working system of 'Bitcoin' BCH split from BTC. 

For people who had been using bitcoin prior to the fork, BCH is the continuation of Bitcoin and BTC is a re-development based on the project named bitcoin. 

BTC has radically changed a few fundamental aspects of the Bitcoin system both in function and utility; not to mention code (increased attach vector and technical debt) and complexity.

The plans and ideas laid out by Satoshi that everyone had researched and joined until 2014 are what BCH is based on. 


If the DRP can ever be solved and the LN works as anticipated (with the anticipated 2016 release) then the LN can be adopted to almost any blockchain, BCH included. However by addressing the tx-mal issue (not a problem though) BCH can incorproate a LN far for effeciently than BTC has; so even if BCT adds a working LN they will still be slower and more expensive than BCH";2;0;False;utopiawesome;e1x9kny;Someone has got triggered by a Bitcoin Cash sticker, so I slapped a fresh one just next to it;8wjr3x;https://i.redd.it/94a3eeyoob811.jpg
I have removed stickers like this. The key is to hack at the corners with a ballpoint pen. You have to lift enough of the corner to actually peel the sticker.
