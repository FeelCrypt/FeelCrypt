I cant tell if some of these exchanges are shady or incompetent or just completely overrun with the growth and dont have the staff to keep up. It took FOREVER to get my money out of Kraken. They dont mention in their tier statements that US residents have a 50k withdraw limit at tier 3 and 100k at tier 4. Had to get both my wife and i verified up so we could get most of our money out, and even then like 2/3 of the wire transfers failed for one reason or another. Just had to keep doing them till they went through.

Sorry to hear you are having problems. Back when Kraken had problems with wires I got caught up for 6 weeks before the whole thing was cancelled and the money was returned. I didn't get entirely stonewalled but comms was not great at times. This was fiat going into the exchange, not as much as you but a decent wedge. While CEX.io customer service sounds appalling (honestly, what exchanges are not crap?!), I'm gonna guess that, *eventually*, things will work out. If their TCs say 60 days (which is fcuking useless), then I doubt they are going to do anything unless they have to - especially if they're totally bogged down, as is almost certainly the case.

I don't know why you're getting down voted, that's BS. I think your comments are spot on. Although I've not dealt with CEX, I've run into kind of similar issues elsewhere (perhaps not as bad) but I think in general as cypto enthusiasts and traders, we have to accept that most exchanges are terrible: understaffed, incompetent, technically incapacitated at times, deceitful, slow and even contemptuous towards customers. But that does not mean criminal, and patience is certainly the name of the game when these issues arise. And I mean *patience*, as in even weeks to months.

You had to buy bcc from them, basically giving them btc in exchange for an useless token. To make it better, you even had to give that one to them so you could ""receive"" interest.

"If you think of Fiat like a crypto coin, its main use is tax payments, since no other asset class will be accepted by each government that does a fiat currency. Also, its about 3% physical, which has a local value, and is simple for grandma to understand. I doubt many over 50 will ever move to all crypto, unless forced. On the downside, governments can make as much fiat as they want, whenever they want, and they don't have to tell us what they are doing. Which we sorta accept, although the recent hyper digi-printing of money is getting kinda nuts, and can only end bad (again) Cryptos won't replace fiat for taxes, unless government concedes that it is incompetent to manage the money supply, and lets someone else run it.

"It is a bitcoin with tor bolted on, and it claims to be a privacy coin. Not only that, but I frequently see shills promoting it as an alternative to monero. If bitcoin with tor isn't an alternative to something, verge is less of an alternative to that thing. Bitcoin with tor is not a valid privacy protecting alternative to monero, so neither is verge. Verge is branded as something it's not, and its shills quietly insert its name into lists with legit coins to make it seem legit too. They'll often be like: ""I understand that the main privacy coins, zcash, monero, and verge will be here forever, due to their very strong privacy, but what about xyz coin, can it measure up to those?"" So that if you've never heard of verge, but you have heard of monero and zcash and know them to be at least somewhat legit, you might easily be fooled, and the more times you see it the more likely you are to believe it. You can look into all of this, and I encourage you to. 

I'm not some anti verge shill for the hell of it. But whenever I see promotion of verge or people saying it's good or whatever I'll try to set them straight. I feel like it's almost irresponsible for the more knowledgeable community members not to point out obvious scams given how far reaching the fallout of Bitconnect was, even though I couldn't believe anyone would fall for it. 

Oh also, more recently the ""Wraith Protocol"" which first of all is JUST optional stealth addressing (actually called ""optional stealth addressing"", lol) and second of all does not even meet the definition of a protocol, which was waaaay overhyped as some godly and novel blockchain obfuscation technique, was NOT implemented. The developer of verge, Justin I'm pretty sure his name is, set a date of January 1st 2018, but failed to deliver his overhyped, and even if it had been implemented, mostly useless optional stealth addressing. Monero has had stealth addresses as the default since 2014, and it is extremely disingenuous to frame stealth addresses as an entirely new protocol, when multiple other coins have already implemented it. 

It's starting to finally cool off, but I know plenty of people who bought it and were making fun of me for hodling xmr, cuz verge was the next best thing and going to the moon or whatever they said. Just look at it now. Absolute p&d, nothing of value whatsoever. If people start talking about it again, you know better now. They've been shilling it since like 2 years ago, it's just gotten worse more recently. It is dying down now, again, but I'm sure they'll be back soon.

"The main difference is that while most cryptos are primarily speculative in nature, BitConnect has literally no value or use outside of their pyramid scheme. 

It was sold and marketed as a ""lending platform"" that boasted an average of 1% interest per day. It was a classic ponzi scheme that even has it's own category (High-Yield Investment Program) which piggy-backed on the success and hype of cryptocurrency to serve as a front for what was really going on. 

The only purpose the token has ever served and will ever served was for their ""lending platform"". They claimed that they had a ""trading bot"" (a common claim made by HYIP ponzi schemes) that would distribute it's profits daily amongst people who were staking the BitConnect Coin through their website. Essentially, participants were required to send BTC/ETH to their website in order to buy and sell BitConnect Coin, which they could then ""lend"" to the bot to collect daily interest. Without the existence of that lending platform, participants are left with BitConnect Coins which serve no purpose, are only available to be traded on 1 or 2 real exchanges, and have a real value of zero considering there's no incentive for anybody to ever buy them";41;1;False;waytooeffay;dstgn2b;Death of a Scamcoin: r/Bitconnect's front page screenshotted moments before they went private, showing panic, anger, and lots of ill-advised investment claims, several claiming to have lost over $100k;7qzpmw;https://imgur.com/a/TLimM

"it lacks a sufficient privacy feature set to be called a privacy coin, but claims that as it's use case

it claims to have accomplished something related to privacy first but it hasn't.

it brings nothing new whatsoever to the table

people have been using TOR to hide their IP while using Bitcoin for about seven years.  Any cryptocurrency can be used with TOR, and there are many wallets for Bitcoin, Litecoin, and countless others with TOR before.

Stealth addresses have also been around for years before Verge.

That's the feature set for privacy with Verge, two extremely basic rudimentary steps that others have made, and ages ago.

If you want very strong trustless privacy, check out Monero

If you're willing to sacrifice the trustlessness for less on-chain overhead, something with Zcash's zkSnarks like Zcash, Komodo, ZCL, or Zen will work, as will a coin with Zerocoin protocol (Zcoin, PivX)

If you want pretty strong trustless privacy but don't want to sacrifice trustlessness OR scalability, GRIN is a cryptocurrency being built around Mimblewimble protocol.  If you want to know what Mimblewimble is, see what Andrew Poelstra and Greg Maxwell have to say about it.  There's some good talks on YouTube and on a few podcasts.

Also, ZEN may be tackling scalability by switching to DAG like RaiBlocks (XRB) and ByteBall (GBYTE) but it will continue to use zkSnarks which require trust in the ZEC trusted setup so it's not trustless.

If you think Verge has anything at all going for it, I suggest that in the future when you're trying to evaluate a new cryptocurrency, you look at how it compares to it's direct competitors.  As it stands, Verge simply does not come close to cutting it in it's field.  The only way that it has done anything for anyone is with stupid gains based on hollow hype.  Maybe they'll add confidential transactions later and still be years behind in it's field.  Maybe they'll just copy the code, give it a new name, and hype it as some ""new protocol"" (with a catchy name) for many months before implementing it, like they did with stealth addresses (Wraith protocol) and all the Verge sheeple will be like ""told you so!"" when they do so.  Maybe it'll go to the moon when this happens - the market is irrational, otherwise it wouldn't have to market cap that it does now - but real projects that are actually good for their use cases will come out on top in the long run.";26;2;False;jjones4coin;dstowwk;Death of a Scamcoin: r/Bitconnect's front page screenshotted moments before they went private, showing panic, anger, and lots of ill-advised investment claims, several claiming to have lost over $100k;7qzpmw;https://imgur.com/a/TLimM

Frankly I hope authorities go after every person that ever gave a referral out for this ponzi.  It was clearly a scam from the start and there were plenty of warnings about it.

"I've had my doubts about the legitimacy of BitConnect, or more specifically, its lending program ever since I heard users were investing in it. They claimed to be able to offer users something like 1% a day thanks to their ""trading bot and volatility software"". Now, I'm not an expert on trading; I do some now and then, but I can't help but ask: Is 1% daily interest really feasible for any trader, even with the assistance of bots? I think not. Surely there would be some losses down the road which could wipe out users' principals in one move.

&nbsp;

Considering how vague the information related to their lending program was, I'm inclined to think it was a Ponzi scheme from the start. It's not a question of whether anyone lost anything from investing in its lending program (there are already reports of users having lost significant sums of money), but rather how many users were affected and how much in total was lost.";2;1;False;cryptotux;dstwgts;Death of a Scamcoin: r/Bitconnect's front page screenshotted moments before they went private, showing panic, anger, and lots of ill-advised investment claims, several claiming to have lost over $100k;7qzpmw;https://imgur.com/a/TLimM

I assume these people who “ put their life savings” in to Bitconnect are trolls. But at the same time this ponzi was huge. It was worth billions of dollars so someone had to be tricked. I have sympathy but at the same time I don’t. The website was riddled with grammatical errors and the way they even made the money to pay people in the first place with their “ trading bot” made no sense. If someone simply did the math on 1% per day for life they would realize it compounds quickly. At the same time, people make 100x returns on some cryptos so maybe it doesn’t sound too ridiculous. ;11;2;False;Crypto556;dstcfrv;Death of a Scamcoin: r/Bitconnect's front page screenshotted moments before they went private, showing panic, anger, and lots of ill-advised investment claims, several claiming to have lost over $100k;7qzpmw;https://imgur.com/a/TLimM

"This is a good question. First, full nodes are part of the p2p network, without which miners couldn’t communicate. More nodes means a more robust network.

More subtly, full nodes help in the case where two miners generate a new block at the same time. Full nodes will choose whichever block they see first and attach it to their local copy of the chain. When the second version arrives, the node sees a fork. Eventually a new block will arrive that makes one branch longer than the other, so the longer branch is kept, and the other discarded.

Where does that number even come from? When has that been the case the last time, if ever? Wouldn't it be more reasonable to say running a full node would be more related to receiving larger transactions? 

> *  No more than 30% of mining hashpower should be under the jurisdiction of a single State.

That seems really impractical as different states and countries have different operating costs (hardware, electricity and the like). Where's the economic incentive to mine in a country where operating costs are high and you can only hope to break even?

Again, impractical for a miner to not join a pool as he'll get compensation for trying to find the next block there and not only for actually finding the next block (which is highly unlikely for a single miner, anyway).

If there's 50 other people trying to get to 10%, then the network now has 17 + 50 * 2 = 117 Eh/s, and your 2 Eh/s is only now ~2% :)

Every full node. That's why they need to make up a clear majority of the economy.

Compare them. Or rather, the hash of them. Hashes are much cheaper than verifying signatures.

From an archive node, which is perfectly safe to run in a handful of untrusted datacentres. They're only needed when a new node is starting, and the data isn't trusted.

There is still the disincentive of other miners producing valid blocks and rejecting invalid ones.

It is entirely relevant as that's the make-or-break factor of getting decentralized hash rate. 

> Every full node. That's why they need to make up a clear majority of the economy.

Full nodes can only freeze BTC in place by rejecting invalid blocks, can't they. They can prohibit spurious transfers but can't facilitate the legitimate transfer of funds, right?

> Compare them. Or rather, the hash of them. Hashes are much cheaper than verifying signatures.

I assumed that comparing hashes would be a form of 'checking them'. Still for the IBD you'd need to verify every signature as you probably did not relay any transactions before, wouldn't you?

> From an archive node, which is perfectly safe to run in a handful of untrusted datacentres. They're only needed when a new node is starting, and the data isn't trusted.

No argument there.

"> Logic. Think about the circumstances where 15% of the network has followed an invalid chain and stands to lose their income for several hours or even days; or else the 85% enforcing the validity rules loses their income instead. It's pretty obvious the 85% will prevail. Change the balance too much, and it becomes less obvious. Give a majority to the invalid-chain-followers (what we probably have today), and you start getting into situations where it's likely the invalid chain will prevail and the full nodes are all forced to give up their rules. End result: hardfork to the Fed, but with miners in charge instead of men appointed by elected officials.

What makes you expect that a majority of nodes is following an invalid chain today? Are you running a full node and confirm that the current chain is invalid? 

> Hard to tell. That's another reason why we need to aim for 85% instead of say 75% - if we're off by 10% (which can happen even with perfect data, due to market changes), it's not as big of a deal.

I agree that the market forces could lead to +/-10% swings.

That's in fact what we have today. More on that further down.

> Hopefully there's at least 4 nations that can compete on operating costs... it's not really that high of a bar to expect.

I guess by that you mean that there may be four nations with comparably small operating costs as I don't see why a country would actively seek to compete for bitcoin mining, i.e. giving up the power over their monetary policies (regarding fiat, obviously). 

> 10% finds 14 blocks on average every day. You don't get any benefit from a pool once you get to that size. Even 1% will find a block every day, more than enough.

What would you expect is the up-front investment cost for 10% of the hash rate in the US? What about in the EU? Whats the cost for 1% rate? This is exactly why early-adopters (or early mines, if you will) of bitcoins or 'the rich' are bound to control Bitcoin. If you aim at controlling 1% hash rate; there may be only 99 other people of 7bn that also control as much hash rate as you do; an insanely small fraction of the world population.

> During IBD, we need the total sync time short enough that it's the obvious ""just do it"" default for users.

This isn't the obvious choice now, and I think will not be the case in the foreseeable future, as the current [average global bandwidth](https://www.akamai.com/us/en/multimedia/documents/state-of-the-internet/q1-2017-state-of-the-internet-connectivity-executive-summary.pdf) of 7.2 Mbps would still require 8 hours of syncing the current block chain.

Another important aspect for global adoption, I think, would be accessibility for mobile devices as many people do not have access to devices other than mobile phones. For this usage the current chain size is already prohibitive and there is no other way than having SPV wallets. This is where storage space becomes relevant again.

"Lightning network is certainly a complicated decentralized exchange the same way the bitcoin blockchain is. You can move Bitcoins back and forth, that's it.

Most Bitcoin transactions involve off chain services (all except donations as far as I can tell). The lightning network is secured by the Bitcoin blockchain, but it doesn't change that dynamic.

As for regulations, you make a large number of assumptions here. What is a hub? Do you really think any user with more than one lightning network channel will be legally treated as a money transmitter?

When money transmission laws are written state by state, some might well attempt to restrict lightning network use within the state, but it's not clear that money transmission laws generally apply to cases where there is no custodial involvement.

In any case, my support of lightning network assumes that opening a second channel does not open me to money transmission regulation. Just as with bitcoin and bitcoin cash, lightning network could well be shut down at any moment (at least for my purposes since I'm not interested in breaking laws, even stupid ones).

It's not like this is a secret, there's absolutely a risk of regulatory problems, and people are working on reducing this risk.

Mark my words, if LN is ever released and functional, adoption will be a fraction of a percent and the BTC mempool will not budge. When it fails, instead of BTC shills demanding that people adopt Segwit, they'll be demanding that people adopt LN. Meanwhile BTC will continue to bleed support and value.

This means that the issue is legally open to interpretation in many jurisdictions (most US states and most countries).

So no, no matter how often an anonymous redditor assures me that a vaguely defined hub will be interpreted as a money transmitter in all of a hundred or so relevant jurisdictions, I'm not particularly convinced.

you can disagree with what government is spending those money for or you can disagree with the amount government is billing you but neither of those change the fact that tax is bill to you from government.

that just means you're a horrible human being or a maximalist 15 year old. i'm sure you wouldn't say that if your parents went broke and/or got sick, right? if you would - you're even worse.

if you wouldn't - why? it's not like you have some contractual relations with your parents that oblige you to be helping them? the answer is that you relate to your parents and don't want them to suffer. it's fine when your urge to reduce suffering of those whom you relate to decreases with degree of separation, but any line you draw where you say ""here i care, there i don't give a shit, those chumps can go die"" is arbitrary. the only sensible position is to accept that you relate to all human beings.
