" Bitcoin's price surged above $8,800 today in spite of unfavorable conditions in regards to low token circulations in danger of touching annual lows. Daily token circulation is the amount of unique tokens that are being transacted between addresses in a given day. In order for Bitcoin's price to continue moving forward, whether on a short or long-term timeframe, these levels of circulation need to theoretically increase over time. Right now, we have seen an interesting anomaly where the price has rebounded from $6,600 quite drastically in spite of the lack of current market usage. Stay tuned, and our site will provide more updates if and when these market conditions begin to look more favorable fundamentally. For now, we just suggest that traders proceed with caution.

This isn't spending BCH. This is using BCH to spend fiat. All you are doing is giving more money and business to exchanges. The businesses who are accepting your fiat payments using BCH don't give a shit that you are using BCH. They likely don't even see that you used BCH, but the payment processor does.

And all of this will take more time and money than using other methods to spend your fiat money.

Using something for something it's extremely not useful for (like using BCH to spend fiat) isn't gonna make it more valuable. If anything it will show just how not useful it is for those applications.

The fact that you even have to use it like this and give it away to other people in hopes they use it similarly says a lot.

If this was really an issue, OP\_RETURN should be removed from BCH immediately and only allow normal address -> address coin transactions with no arbitrary data permitted. But no, that's not what the BCH authority wants either, weird.

The idea is to increase blocksize when it is actually needed and work on more pressing problems first instead. Like privacy/fungibility, or increasing safety of 0-conf.

- Steal my private keys

- Attempt to transmit an older favorable LN state.

- Race condition when submitting an onchain state when the Bitcoin mempool is full and blocks are full, as noted by the creator of Lightning himself.

"I don't hate LN, I hate all the problems LN introduces. LN was meant to allow low transaction fees but instead it created all these problems. Solve 1 problem, create 12 more lol


- In Bitcoin my coins can only be stolen if I leak my private key.  For LN your money can be stolen simply by not being online to monitor your money. In addition to stealing your LN private keys, a bad user can attempt to steal your funds when you're offline. Which is why LN requires a 3rd party service called Watchtowers to watch over your funds. Way more complicated than Bitcoin

- In LN when making a transactions you must always reserve the current Bitcoin on chain miner fee, so that if either channel party wants to close the channel it'll get accepted and mined by a Bitcoin miner. when Bitcoin fees hit $3 a few months ago, 60% of the Lightning network capacity was locked up in miner fees.

- Merchants have to top up their channels so they can keep accepting money. You don't have this on Bitcoin. I can have an empty address on Bitcoin and receive all the Bitcoin in the world on it. 


- With Bitcoin I can keep my money in a cold wallet. With LN it's either a hot wallet or cold wallet and I must close all my channels and pay the Bitcoin onchain fee just to close it. You're literally choosing between low fees OR security with Lightning, where as with Bitcoin you have both.

- LN requires  both parties to be online to transact. You don't have this with Bitcoin.


- The unsolvable routing problem. A good chunk of LN transactions will fail simply because the routing is weighted and changes constantly. Compare that to Bitcoin's gossip network which doesn't require any weighted routing.  Weighted routing is currently a mathematically unsolved problem.

- LN is centralizing around LNbig.com At one point LNBig.com had over 70% of the entire LN network capacity. LN will continue to centralize around these big hubs, because they can offer cheap connections and low fees than a regular peer can.

"> You still don't understand the incentive system and the LN security model as a whole. There's no way for an attacker to know exactly when the other peer will come back online or even if they're using a watchtower. 

Easy. 

1) First step is to fund a second node with a minimum amount and attempt to send a few pennies and see if they accept and seem online or not.

2) If they seem offline but you're not sure if they have watchtowers, then attempt a theft attempt again with a low funded node for a few pennies again on the second node.

3) Should steps 1+2 work out, then attempt a proper theft attempt.

Even easier if you physically know the location of the store and know it's without power.

I understand LN's model. It's to bypass the security of onchain Bitcoin that miners provide with extra steps. Hashrate doesn't matter on LN. Neither does securing your private keys either on LN. You must be forever vigilant so long as you have an LN balance, for fear that a channel partner can steal your funds.

LN's funds are in a constant state of IOU for days, even weeks depending on the channel settings and the incentive model for LN is to never close the channel to avoid paying the onchain fee thereby keeping you exposed for that duration. Meanwhile a 0-conf payment is at worst a 10-20 minute per purchase, NOT risking any further funds.

No, they don't need that. They could simply move miners out gradually. I mean they're *financing* a future attack by pumping their coin, which they probably hold large amounts of.

"The liquid bid / ask total on BSV is around 1/3rd the size of BCH and around 1/50th the size of BTC. Right now, SV has around 1.4M of bid liquidity and 800k of ask.

Volumes alone aren't a great indicator, because if I buy $1000 of a coin, then sell it, then do that 49 more times, that counts as $100,000 in volume that has done literally nothing to the market. This happens frequently with arbitrage bots - and when prices are wildly in flux like SV today, that pushes up volume because of said bots.

This example runs counter to your argument though.  If you look at what happened to the BCH/BTC ratio from the time after the fork when Roger started trashing bitcoin and trying to pump BCH, the exact opposite happened.  

Yes CSW can dump Bitcoin for BSV like Roger (claims he) did with BCH.   But when hes done dumping all his BTC and hoarding more BSV, there will be no one left to sell the BSV to.  Because he is one of the only one who wants to buy them.

"""Fake"".  No.  Adoption is real, support is real.  One bad site that was producing fake numbers does not make adoption or support fake.  The fact that development continues to improve BCH indicates real support.  As better features are added, more adoption will follow.

If you really want to sink BCH with BTC, start improving BTC so that BCH has no reason to exist.  That, however, will not happen so long as Bitcoin Core prevents or discurrages innovation with censorship and ejecting those who disagree or have different views.

"I'm going to have to disagree - I fully admit that BTC legitimately has the bigger network with more active addresses and has earned *most* of the current $8k price-point.

At the same time, the support and services for merchants are better and more complete on BCH. I have seen comparatively little development on BSV. Additionally, the availability of BSV seems limited to Asia-facing markets. Most of the US-facing exchanges are not the top-tier reputable exchanges. I'm not saying that BSV can't sustain a run in Asian markets alone - it certainly can, but the potential for going viral like BTC did in 2016-2017 is higher on BCH right now.

Further, the number of payment services and systems for BTC currently are about the same, or maybe slightly outnumber BCH, but I haven't seen one yet that doesn't have at least a minor downside compared with a BCH solution.

The funds in any channel can still be censored by the channel partner.

You've reversed cause and effect. The network isn't custodial because an uncooperative LN nodes can become a nuisance and incur a cost. Uncooperative LN nodes can become a nuisance and incur a cost because LN is semicustodial. 

Custody refers to who controls the funds in the channel. It is simply a fact that the custody of the coins in the channel is jointly held by both channel partners.

">I thought LN was initially proposed to open several channels not just one. I read recently that multi path payments are being worked on.

That doesn't really solve the problem though. You're just attempting to mitigate the problem of counterparty risk by spreading it around to lots of counterparties. But opening and maintaining lots of channels quickly becomes very expensive in a high on-chain fee environment.  Borrowing from something I've written before:

 One of the fatal flaws of the LN's design concerns the existence of two powerful incentives. On the one hand, there's very good reason to have as few open channels as possible -- especially in an environment of high and volatile on-chain fees. High on-chain fees increase the costs associated with opening channels, maintaining channels (funds need to be reserved in the ""miner's bucket"" to allow for their future closure, and when on-chain fees rise, more funds need to be moved into the bucket), and closing channels that are no longer useful (and rededicating those funds to some other channel). On the other hand, you also want your payment routes to be as short as possible. Shorter routes (a) are more likely to exist (the maximum possible payment along a particular route is limited by the hop with the smallest liquidity in the required direction); (b) are easier to find; (c) are very likely to be cheaper to use (because every hop needs to be compensated for locked liquidity); and (d) are much less likely to fail mid-flight. Thus (and again, especially as on-chain fees become significant), your incentive is to only open channels with partners who you're extremely confident will provide the greatest benefit. That means centrally-positioned (within the LN's topology), massively-capitalized, massively-connected, professionally-run, and (inevitably) heavily-regulated ""hubs.""

>Don't I incur fees regardless of whether the channel closure is mutual or not?

Yes. The point is that because your channel partner is no longer providing value to you, either because they're refusing to route your payments, or requiring extortionate fees to do so, or simply because they no longer have the inbound (or outbound) connectivity / liquidity necessary to enable the payments you need -- because of that, you're going to have to incur (potentially very significant) transaction fees to extricate yourself from the relationship.  

>Tbh that applies to everyone I do business with not just a LN node channel partner...

I suppose that applies in many business relationships where trust is required. But Bitcoin's goal was to remove the need for a trusted counterparty to simply send and receive money.

> But I can't think of another situation where I can easily punish a thief by not just taking back what is mine, but also taking everything that is his.

You just get his channel balance if you succeed in blocking the theft.  If the channel is heavily unbalanced such that the would-be thief has very little or no funds on his side, he loses almost nothing in the attempt (but potentially stands to gain a great deal by publishing an out-of-date channel state where the channel was heavily unbalanced in his favor).

>I get that uncooperative LN nodes can become a nuisance and incur a cost, but I'm having a very hard time seeing how that makes LN custodial.

Semi-custodial.  They have partial control over your funds during the life of the channel.  And again, my point is that the significance of this kind of semi-custodial control increases progressively as on-chain fees rise.   If an on-chain tx fee is $50, or $100, or $500, many people would not consider having to incur that cost to be a mere ""nuisance.""

>Especially considering it is in all my peers interest not to become a nuisance as they'd just end up blacklisted otherwise.

If you understand how the LN's naturally-emergent topology is one of massive centralization (and further understand how centralizing pressures are greatly exacerbated by high on-chain fees), the problem should become obvious.  In a ""mature"" LN, you can expect an entrenched banking cartel to occupy the network's center. If your hub partner begins censoring / misbehaving, you can certainly close your channel and attempt to “just” open a new channel with a non-censoring partner who has comparable (or at least reasonably adequate) liquidity and connectivity. The problem is such a partner may not exist! The network effects involved make routing around a misbehaving cartel very difficult and costly. Take a step back and look at the difficulty of routing around the network effects surrounding government fiat money!";4;1;False;Capt_Roger_Murdock;feea2ks;Most of the ‘Lightning Network’ demonstration videos you see on Twitter are actually custodial payments that they call ‘Lightning Network.;eon03n;https://twitter.com/derykmakgill/status/1217096717998460928

"I think there are a number of reasons the “semi-custodial” label applies. You need your channel partner’s  permission and cooperation to send and receive payments through them. They can at the very least *delay* your access to your funds by refusing to cooperatively close. A channel partner who becomes noncooperative (or whose cooperation becomes unreasonably conditional) forces you to incur transaction fees to close the channel and establish a new one with a hopefully more cooperative partner. Your channel partner is also in a unique position to attempt to steal from you and must be actively monitored against such theft attempts.

"Yep, this is the lightning demonstration scam they've been pulling for years.

Demonstrating what they actually say you are supposed to do is nearly impossible.

Run a full BTC node, spin up a Lightning node, do an on-chain transaction to fund lightning channels (which ones? Who knows!). 

**Wait at least one hour for 6 confirmations to fund lightning channels.**

Hire watch towers and setup channel-state-backups.

The masses are never going to do this.

Do all of that and then you can maybe spend some lightning, as long as the system doesn't run out of liquidity first.

">I read that there is a minimum which has to remain on each side precisely to disincentivize theft.

Hmm, I don't know if that's been implemented but it's an obvious way to attempt to mitigate the problem I'm describing. Of course it creates problems of its own by making some LN funds effectively unusable -- thereby further limiting the payment possibilities graph. E.g., your channel partner *would* have enough outbound (to you) liquidity to enable you to receive a desired payment, but now he can't because of a minimum balance requirement you've imposed. And presumably, the minimum balance requirement would need to be set as some *percentage* of channel funds.  A high probability of losing fifty bucks might not suffice to deter the attempted theft of a million.  

>To be clear: If onchain tx fees actually ever reached 50, 100 or 500 USD opening and closing LN channels wouldn't just be a nuisance. The entire LN project would be dead. 

The BTC median transaction fee briefly hit $33 in December 2017. That's already not too far from $50. 

>No one will ever, under any conditions, pay 500USD to open/close a LN channel. People will just use Ethereum vX.0, Bitcoin Cash, Monero, Litecoin or fiat. 

Yes, I'd tend to agree. It sounds like we're on the same page. Clearly the LN becomes a *completely* unworkable shit show at *some* sufficiently high on-chain fee level.  But there might be lower on-chain fee levels where it's only a *mostly* unworkable shit show. If on-chain fees are lower still, there's simply no point to using it given the worse user experience and added risks.  

>You are foreseeing a centralized LN network with KYC, AML and AXA in control with 50-500USD fees for opening and closing channels. Do know of anyone that is interested in using such a network? Are you under the impression that this is what people over on r/bitcoin are looking forward to?

To be clear, I'm describing an ""optimistic"" scenario for the LN, one in which it actually gains mass global adoption.  I absolutely don't think it will get that far.

>You are literally asserting conditions that any reasonable person would already consider failure conditions and then proceeding to argue that therefore(???) things don't work. Seems a bit redundant. 

Not sure what you're having trouble following. Here's how I'd summarize the key points: (1) the LN is a necessarily imperfect substitute for on-chain transactions, and one with strong built-in incentives towards centralization. (2) Moreover, it *becomes* a progressively *more* imperfect substitute, and the incentives towards centralization become progressively *stronger*, as on-chain fees rise.  EDIT: (3) Consequently, the LN is not a ""scaling solution,"" i.e., it simply cannot eliminate the problems created by BTC's imposition of an arbitrary and increasingly-inadequate limit on transactional capacity.

>Your predictions regarding LN topology and tx fees are just that, predictions. Extrapolating conclusions from your predictions does not award them more merit. 

Yes, they're obviously predictions (although they're really conditional predictions as again, I'm NOT optimistic that LN will see mass global adoption). But they're predictions that seem to follow in a fairly straightforward way from the incentives involved. 

Also don't forget about the problem of securing the blockchain as the block subsidy diminishes and eventually disappears entirely. We've already established that the LN doesn't work with ""high"" on-chain fees (which you seem to agree with, at least if we define $50 fees as ""high""). But Bitcoin proper (with a tiny, artificially-constrained capacity) doesn't work with *low* on-chain fees. In order to have ""a lot"" of security in the future, miners will need to collect ""a lot"" in transaction fees. Theoretically, that could be achieved in one of two ways: a huge number of individually-quite-cheap transactions (the original Satoshi plan) OR a relatively small number of individually-very-expensive transactions (the Core redesign). What absolutely *can't* work is a tiny number of individually-cheap on-chain transactions (with a much, much greater number of transactions being handled by the LN).";3;1;False;Capt_Roger_Murdock;feel8t2;Most of the ‘Lightning Network’ demonstration videos you see on Twitter are actually custodial payments that they call ‘Lightning Network.;eon03n;https://twitter.com/derykmakgill/status/1217096717998460928
">If the channel is heavily unbalanced such that the would-be thief has very little or no funds on his side

I read that there is a minimum which has to remain on each side precisely to disincentivize theft.

>If an on-chain tx fee is $50, or $100, or $500, many people would not  consider having to incur that cost to be a mere ""nuisance.""

To be clear: If onchain tx fees actually ever reached 50, 100 or 500 USD opening and closing LN channels wouldn't just be a nuisance. The entire LN project would be dead. No one will ever, under any conditions, pay 500USD to open/close a LN channel. People will use Ethereum vX.0, Bitcoin Cash, Monero, Litecoin or fiat instead... long before btc tx fees reach 50USD.

"The tale of two other neighbors:

One day Jack found two coins outside his doorsteps. One made out of gold and the other one out of silver. He was really happy. Both coins had a different set of strengths and he decided to keep both of them.

On the same day Peter also found two coins outside his doorsteps. He didn't like the face on the silver coin which was the face of a well known scammer. Also the silver coin was worth less. So he decided to sell the silver coin and ended up with a total of 1.1 gold coins.

Gold continued to increase in value and Peter ended up better of. He started bashing Jack for not being smart enough to sell his silver coin. Jack on the other hand was pretty relaxed. He was still well of with the gold coin and the silver coin was a good hedge in case gold and silver would flippen at some point. Why sell the silver coin only to end up with a tiny amount of more gold and no silver?

Then one day silver and gold actually started to flippen. But Peter didn't accept that he made a mistake. Instead he posted on Reddit about how his decision made absolute sense.

Moral of the story: Don't bet everything on a single coin. Diversify. Smart players hold all of their post-fork coins because you never know what's going to happen.";4;0;False;_--__-_-_--_-_-__--_;fedqjj1;A tale of two neighbours;eolgp4;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/eolgp4/a_tale_of_two_neighbours/

The scaling solution for BSV is to have specialized HW mining nodes, none of which have been demonstrated to the best of my knowledge. I could be wrong.

BCH approach is to make protocol changes to improve block propagation and and enable more secure pruning etc via UTXO commitments etc, to improve performance there first. In that sense ""BSV only changed number"" is not inaccurate.

> or that ""it's just Calvin's nodes in some rack""..

Well anyone with a brain knows that this is pure garbage, or at least completely overstated. This can safely be ignored. There is miner incentive on BSV as long as there is an positive exchange rate, just like any other sha256 coin.

> or all the ""I dumped my BSV"" threads or how much this sub was pushing #delistbsv or how there are some CSW FUD threads here all the time, etc.

People were not happy with CSW, as with any politician/public figure. We should not care too much about the people, more about the tech. I have listened to CSW's talks as well as others, taking with me what is interesting.

No I didn't read this before.

My first reaction is that it points out issues with ABC and pulls them over BCH as a whole, but does not really explain how this is fixed in BSV/nChain.

> centralized checkpointing

I don't see how the checkpointing system could be considered centralized, as all nodes just opts to the first public chain preventing reorgs over 10-blocks. You can still do 51% attacks but you have to do it publicly, and you can't do a reorg longer than 10 blocks without manual intervention in the nodes.

> “protocol development centralization” which ABC has finally achieved through this war

While I do agree that BCH development is now lead by ABC there is enough agreement in the community about the implemented changes so far, to not become an issue. There is open discussion about the steps that are being taken.

BCH is still quite small and can therefore still make changes to the protocol relatively easily.

Development gets much harder if BCH grows as large as BTC is now, and therefore ABC is pushing forward their vision seemingly aggressively.

As an example adding avalanche will not happen just like that even if ABC could provide the implementation, unless there is agreement among miners and exchanges alike. This is politics you cannot avoid.

> ""ABC can’t give up on this feature because if they do, then it will be admitting they didn’t know what they were doing.""

This seems like a pain point. They can dump it, while keeping their faces. It will be up to more than them if it gets activated, and even what the final functionality will look like. Do they have a strong influence? Absolutely.

Avalanche is one attempt to solve the ""near instant transaction security for merchants"", could be something else if a better idea is presented, or avalanche can be improved.

Anyway this was some quite random picks. No arguments for BSV that I can find, only criticisms for ABC which from my perspective apply to BSV nChain as well.

"The reason BSV is pushing up is that it appears (don't hodl your breath) that CW may actually turn over keys to his Tulip Trust.  This would prove he's Satoshi (or associated with the now dead Satoshi).  It would mean that 1M BTC could be swapped for BSV.

Ignoring that good news for BSV holders (I hodl my initial investment of BTC that split into BCH and BSV, still untouched),  BSV is an inferior coin because:

* CSW has previously indicated that he was willing to take coins out of circulation based on how they were used on the BCH chain.

* CSW has indicated that privacy should not be a thing in favor of government KYC.

* BSV has fewer use cases, adoption, and a much smaller community.

The only reason to buy or hold BSV would be as speculation that CSW intents to prop it up with BTC holdings.

"So, your saying you think this BSV price action is natural market behavior (not a fake pump)?

The point of this thread was that we should not care much about this BSV price pump. I even think it will be good for the BCH price.We should just be careful in case it is part of an attack on BCH. You are correct price is not too important to the function of a real peer-to-peer electronic cash for the world's people (BCH's goal). The competition for hash rate is a concern when other coins are pumped to unnatural price highs that make miners mine those pretender coins to the near exclusion of the real Bitcoin(s). It is all temporary though.

"Sure, I'm not really trying to spin a narrative though, just plain facts.

>Can you share a few examples of what you bought in those transactions?

The only thing I've bought is credit top ups for my cellphone through bitrefill, PSN credit and a service that displays any website link you choose. If I had to guess, I'd say half of these transactions comprise of these purposes.  The rest were tips to various content creators online and to the dev team that write the full LN node software that I run.

>While I don't make many BCH transactions I made about 45,000 trades in 2019 for BCH.

Really?  That averages 123 trades a day.. Also are those on chain or within an exchange?

(OK, I'm responding to your comment in sections so I'll leave the one above even though you've answered it here) .. It's an entirely different situation though.

"Bitcoin (and all its forks) have an _average_ block time of 10 minutes.  However block times can vary from a few seconds to a few hours in unusual cases. This is both part of the protocol mechanism and also external influence such as varying hash rate.

"Fiat is the money you use every day. In your bank account; in your wallet; with you bank card; with your credit card. The reason it's called ""fiat"" is of latin origin. Fiat means, 'let it be done'.

Fiat's value is dictated by your government's power. By your governments decree (because they tell you it is). It's value is that you can use it to service debt, pay taxation, and interact in the economy using it.

The problem is that the governments have been taken over by corporate influences (lobbying, bribes, corruption). Companies that are not growing are being grouped with those experiencing exponential growth. Multiple indexes are broken. They're not weighting properly.

Interest rates worldwide are at lows and governments are switching to negative interest rates, which is bullish as fuck for any crypto that can actually be used as a transactional currency. Yields will go down. Only valuable assets (scarce and useful) will keep pace.

This is the system we loaded into.

It's a broken system. Right now I'm watching an everything bubble accelerate. I'm scared shitless. I'm just glad Satoshi determined how to solve our problem. Money is energy over time.

"It’s not simple. Unnoticed inflation bugs can also happen in transparent coins. Quoting u/dEBRUYNE_1

>We can verify the soundness of the protocol by verifying the mathematics of Bulletproofs, relying on the discrete logarithm assumption, and verifying the soundness of the code implementation. To quote sarang:

>In many of these discussions on supply auditing, it gets frustrating because nobody really formally defines what ""supply auditing"" is supposed to mean. If it means the ability to view plaintext output amounts and compute balance in the clear, then neither (shielded) Zcash nor Monero nor any similar asset will meet your needs.

>If it means that clever math is used to assert that funds are not created unexpectedly while retaining hidden amounts, you have to define what you're willing to accept as valid. Shielded Zcash uses circuit-enforced checks to assert balance; Monero uses a particular commitment-related key within its MLSAG signatures to assert balance, along with commitment range proofs. (I realize that Zcash has used transparent migration, but I'm talking strictly about shielded stuff.) At some point, you're trusting in the math and its implementation to prevent silent inflation.

>It is not clear what changes to the math would satisfy everyone's definition of a ""supply audit"" without explicitly revealing amounts.

However, this refers to *double-spend arrival ordering*. The mere *presence* of a transaction in a block signals that it was seen first and its *""order""* established.

If  Craig was really Satoshi and wrote the Bitcoin whitepaper, he would have  understood that it was the arrival order, not block stuffing order.

"I am not surprised. I have decided not to say anything negative about BSV so I'm trying to keep that going. But I'm really disappointed with BU for manipulating conflicts within the Bitcoin Cash community. I have a sense that BU wants to influence people to think all problem is on ABC when reality is that ABC has so far, managed to accomplished much more at a fraction of the resources BU had. There is simply no comparison. This type of behavior needs to be called out. People who have the best interests for Bitcoin Cash, peer to peer cash, will look for ways to resolve conflicts, not incite conflicts. 

BU has done some questionable things which made me start to rethink where their goals are.

- Having anti-BCH people in their community and ranks. I am not talking about normal people. I am referring to people like PaintedFrog and Hernzzzzz type of folks.

- BU having over 95% in BTC and almost nothing in BCH. They have no skin in the game and no incentives to make Bitcoin Cash successful. If they can sabotage Bitcoin Cash so that BTC price grows further, they are in a better financial position than people like myself, who was 100% in Bitcoin Cash.

- Peter Rizun tweeting his intentions of BTC raising blocksize. He seems to care more for BTC than BCH.

">I watched Peter Rizun try to convince a telegram channel that the SV split was Amaury's fault 

That's disgusting. By that standard, BSV could easily be ""Peter's fault"", as Peter is the one who took Craig and nChain's money to do scaling research, giving Craig credibility in the newly forming BCH community.  Also Peter was ""negotiating with terrorists"" during the CTOR debate, giving the BSV people a platform when they were just trying to gather momentum for their malicious hard fork. Finally, Peter allowed (and continues to allow) the stealth BSV people to use Unlimited project as cover to launch attacks on ABC.

"> I thought crypto would self select for intelligence.......

It's not lack of intelligence.

It's herd mentality. Even smart people fall for this, because ultimately they prefer for somebody to think for them, instead of thinking for themselves.

Watch some nature documentary movies or watch how sheep, horses or cows behave in the field, this behavior is prevalent in almost all mammal, reptile, avian and marine species living in large groups.

We are still herd animals, we prefer to follow alpha rather than decide for ourselves.

This is the main reason Blockstream attack worked and the reason why censorship works - because people prefer to follow what is given to them and don't dig in to seek advanced sophisticated answers right away.

I was also angry when I first noticed this in 2016, because I though that crypto enthusiasts are better than this, that they are rebels, they reject authority by default. But I was stupid, they are not.

Clearly, you can see that this evil soft fork wouldn't get old nodes to accept inflation, but rather it is more of a backwards compatible way of creating a new system with inflation that destroys the utility of the old one. If I run a pre-soft fork node that doesn't recognize the extension block, you can never get me to, for example, hold more than 21 million ""Bitcoin 1.0"" BTC.

Tariffs are only on foreign goods, and only to countries that are trading on an unequal basis. Even most dems agree with the tariffs, or the reason they're there.

Democrats decrease them, or at least slow their growth. Think of Dems as raising taxes on you yo pay for stuff for you.

This is the average across all industries. Unless the average were a majority of higher wage earners, higher wage earners vs lower wage earners do not skew the average since the majority of industries see an increase in wages. CEOs are also not paid that much. The overwhelming majority of a CEO's net worth comes from their equity in a company, not their wages, and which even if it did matter having an additional ""800x"" pay on 1 worker vs the 1million workers in the automotive industry for example, is negligible to measure average increase in wages.";1;1;False;titratecode;feeg4rk;A newspaper economist is trying to convince me, that becoming poorer is good for the economy, and will, therefore, make everyone richer.;eo5a7v;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/eo5a7v/a_newspaper_economist_is_trying_to_convince_me/

"Labor force participation in the USA has declined to 63% from a high of 67% in late 1990s. It was a bit below 60% in the 50s. Even with the decrease, when I compare life in the 1990s and today, the average person lives a lot more comfortably. I wasn't there in the 50s, but even though a single person could sustain a family, the other adult had a full time job at home to produce value for the family, by raising kids, cooking and doing upkeep. Life wasn't as comfortable as today either. Kids were sharing rooms, 3 or 4 per room at worst. This is clearly not the norm today.

Wealth inequality is a way to whine about having no productive assets. Why would you expect someone with assets you use in your job to give out all revenues from your job? They might as well sell them instead of taking a risk by hiring you. Of course they expect a return on investment greater than risk free rate. You provide labor, they provide tools, customers and a supply chain. That's worth something.

What happens next is they have more free income to reinvest because basic needs cost a smaller percentage of their income. They then get a bigger and bigger part of the revenue stream. It's capitalism. 

The part that nobody mentions is they are always at risk of losing their investment. If their business becomes obsolete, so does their revenue stream. If too many own these assets and nobody works, then labor becomes more lucrative and their assets lose value. Nobody will talk about these people falling down to earth. We have a strong survivor bias and only talk about the likes of Gates or Buffet.

If a given job provides a lower quality of life, it's because that particular job is overrepresented in the economy. Monetary policy changes nothing about it.

Well most people usually get at least a 2% raise every year. So inflation is negligible for the working American. Also your saving assets actually increase along with inflation because purchasing power declines, therefore your assets become worth more to compensate. The only people that actually lose to inflation are ones that keep cash on hand, not in the market or in other assets.;-2;1;False;titratecode;feceiyb;A newspaper economist is trying to convince me, that becoming poorer is good for the economy, and will, therefore, make everyone richer.;eo5a7v;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/eo5a7v/a_newspaper_economist_is_trying_to_convince_me/

I don’t think you’re understanding that the measurement of average wage growth is across all industries and all jobs within the private sector. You cannot have a skewing of management because there are more workers than managers. You’re comparing a difference in wages from two separate groups that both experience wage growth. Inflation of wages is not equivalent to inflation of an industry. Taco Bell managers are worth that much to Taco Bell, whereas nurses are a broad group which happen to be inflated with qualified graduates, so their value goes down. However both of these jobs experience a wage growth of typically 2%;0;0;False;titratecode;feerjlb;A newspaper economist is trying to convince me, that becoming poorer is good for the economy, and will, therefore, make everyone richer.;eo5a7v;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/eo5a7v/a_newspaper_economist_is_trying_to_convince_me/

"Thanks for clarifying. Yes your implementation of the ""choose your own moderator(s) on a forum on top of the BCH blockchain"" idea certainly seems substantially better in terms of censorship abuse protection and spam protection than all current forum systems that I'm aware of. The only hurdle to mass adoption I see is that people in general don't own BCH so they won't be able to write, only read. 

But that should be just temporary assuming that BCH itself gets mass adopted as a currency as well. It seems like good odds for a bright future both for this new type of forum and for the new type of currency (BCH).

I've got good news for you on your comments and questions.
Firstly, here's some more technical information -
https://github.com/memberapp/memberapp.github.io/issues/134

 >Next up should be the ability to choose a mod team led by a specific person. The lead mod should have power over the other mods just like Reddit currently does, and you select the mods as a team, possibly with a team name.

So this is the way it works by default. If you appoint B as your mod, and B appoints C as their moderator, posts that are hidden by C will be hidden for you. So each moderator you appoint acts as a controller of a moderator group. This can be made explicit, and is the recommended way to use it, by setting up a 'Mod Group' as a user which appoints mods. As you say, it has the benefit of being able to shuffle mods into new groupings.

I agree about the danger of defaults. 'No mod' is currently the default. 

Here's a link to the 'Member Mod Group' -
https://memberapp.github.io/#member?qaddress=13LakHA4LdbbrrvFBSGaxDgKt94X8fTtdQ
The profile text can be used to describe the aim of the mod group.

I don't have a UI yet for showing the numbers appointing each mod/mod group, but this is certain something I'm going to add. Also Member will be able to see which mods are popular among users they trust, to avoid sybil attacks with many fake account appointing mods that don't have any real subscribers.";4;0;False;freetrade;febryw3;Wow.
