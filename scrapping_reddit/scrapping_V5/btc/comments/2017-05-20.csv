"> Sound money is THE use case.

so true.

reading through the comments here, you were the first to mention what Bitcoin does that Ethereum will never do. Sound money.

"I don't think TSLA has turned a profit in a single quarter since it was incorporated. Maybe once https://www.streetinsider.com/ec_earnings.php?q=TSLA. I'm pretty sure your overall impression of TSLA's business model is incorrect, though. Same deal with Uber, they rely heavily on investors and cut corners to gain market share.

Satoshi said a lot of things dude. He's kinda bailed, leaving us to fix this mess. I agree that price is driven by fundamental value _in the long run_. That's what I mean when I say the price will revert to the fundamental value when the speculative value crashes. It doesn't look like we're quite there yet, though.

Other than that I think we're in agreement: bitcoin is useful as a store of value because of the fundamental value provided by its immutability.

Bonus edit: people in Australia can pay their bills with bitcoin. Is that fundamental enough for ya? ;)

"Yes, I agree. By the way, it's quite funny how the inventor and creator of the Bittorrent protocol has such a hard time to understand the Bitcoin protocol. So hard he doesn't.

And I've never heard of anyone getting double spend attacked after receiving their first confirmation, so I think the 6 confirmation  caution is very exaggerated.

"Absolutely. It might conceivably make a difference to a pool that wants to be able to validate a block as quickly as possible but those guys aren't going to be worrying about putting their hands in their pockets for a couple of sticks o' 4G

The simple truth that's downplayed is that a non-mining node can actually dispense with a lot of stuff (connections, transaction forwarding, high bandwidth) and still be very sure that the blocks they are receiving contain valid Bitcoin transactions. Fewer connections does conceivably mean being more susceptible to DDOS (or potentially less if they do it right) but if you're receiving at least a block every ten minutes on average and it validates and the difficulty looks right, you know you're good (you may want to wait an additional block or two but we're all waiting for six confs anyway, right?) :) In fact, there's no actual need for a Bitcoin user to participate in the gossip protocol at all and if Bitcoin were more modular, we might have seen other options come about. 

They may not be ""doing their part for the network"" but if you're resource starved, I don't think others are going to mind too much. Just like leechers in bittorrent.

I think you are both right. Originally there need to be empty blocks because there would often be 10 minute stretches of time where zero transactions where broadcast.

I see your point about classifying it as an altcoin that's a Bitcoin spinoff. Personally I just think it's practical to make the classification separate the idea of a Bitcoin spinoff from the idea of an altcoin, because it makes it easier to write if you understand what I mean. Especially if you want to write it frequently. And since there's such a difference between an altcoin that has a different genesis block as opposed to an altcoin that has the same genesis block, I think its warranted to refer to those types of coins with different words.;2;1;False;todu;dhsdr0u;amazon.com have 8TB HDs at 180$.

Yes. There is a spectrum of security that is applicable through Bitcoin. Some people don't seem to be able to get their heads around that.

Storage is less of an issue than bandwidth and block propagation though. Bandwidth varies for people around the globe and block verification time doesn’t scale linearly IIRC.

"What running a node from home has anything to do with scaling.

 In 9 years no one lost coins because its SPV wallet was tricked in any way.
What use have you to monitor everyone else transactions?

SegWit require you to download 1 MB+3MB of witness data to verify the blockchain. If you don't download the SegWit data, you are not verifying anything.

So, everything you said about scaling the blocksize is true with scaling using SegWit. The added problem is SPV mining is encouraged by SegWit because you could build a full block without knowing the witness data, as it is transferred separately after the block, so miners risk to pile up valid blocks over unvalid ones. It would be tricky to discover two or three miners had built their blocks on top of an invalid or unverified block.
Three miners could be enough to make the majority of the hash rate and could be unwilling to throw their rewards to build a different branch fully verified.

If you don't trust the miners with larger blocks, they become even less trustworthy with SegWit.";2;0;False;painlord2k;dht13xp;amazon.com have 8TB HDs at 180$.

sub blocks is an answer.  blocks are filled with transactions in real time, with a sub block issued about every 30 seconds.  when the time comes to publish the full ten minute block, the propagation time is dependent on only the size of the last sub block, because the rest of the full block was already agreed to.;2;1;False;capistor;dhsci7m;amazon.com have 8TB HDs at 180$.
