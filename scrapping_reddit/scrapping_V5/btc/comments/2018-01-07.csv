Don’t ask BTC to raise blk size.  Large blk size is now with bitcoin cash. Period.  We should see the small blocksize experiment run to its conclusion.  Maybe they will be right maybe not. Time will tell.  BTC having a small blk size is good for big blockers for many reasons besides the size. Bch also has a less toxic environment, no censored forums, no brilliant-jerk developers.  If BTC raises block size it will really dampen bch progress and we will be stuck with a toxic censored community that is BTC. ;2;0;False;mrtest001;dsbmdse;The idiocracy of r/bitcoin;7opi7w;https://i.imgur.com/I2Rt4fQ.gifv

Is it wrong to think that increasing block size is good but if we do it before we have much higher segwit adoption then sites like Coin base, GDAX and wallets like Mycelium will never invest the resources needed to upgrade to Segwit?

As it stands the pressure is on the big applications to adopt segwit but raise the blocksize now and then they will wait years and hold up Mimble Wimble, Bullet Proofs, and Zsnarks and of course Lightening and all the other awesome stuff segwit allows.

Its not that Im against a bigger block... But of we do it now then the pressure is off for the big guys to adopt segwit.

Like Local Bitcoins just announced its using Segwit... That will get us above 10% soon... One good mobile wallet and coin base and bang we got enough to increase block size";3;3;False;Rellim03;dsbkvth;The idiocracy of r/bitcoin;7opi7w;https://i.imgur.com/I2Rt4fQ.gifv

"Okay, let's see if I understand what's been going on.  
  
A block is a list of transactions. When you make a transaction you peg an additional fee on to it that goes to whoever mines the block with that transaction. By paying a larger fee you're more likely to have your block mined first. As bitcoin's userbase grew there was less block space to go around so fees went up so you're block would be more likely to be mined. If bitcoin increased their blocksize there'd be space for more transactions per block, causing fees to dip.

"What no one seems to point out, is that increasing the blocksize would actually _increase_ 'decentralization', to a point .... so even if 'decentralization' were the single overridingly most important factor in all of this, the argument is _still_ soo weak.

You've two curves interacting - one is what percentage of users a blocksize increase would put running a full node out of reach for (given their hardware), and the other is the overall usage+userbase increase of a blocksize increase and the corresponding expected increase in users running full nodes. 

At the current blocksize, an increase of say 4x would quickly 4x the amount of usage, and correspondingly something around 4x the number of users and thus a big increase in the number of users likely to be running nodes. At the same time, because we're talking pretty low hardware requirements still, it would only reduce the percentage of those able to run a full node by a tiny single digit percentage, leading to a huge overall gain in 'decentralization'. Obviously at some point (of further blocksize increasing() the equation would start to go in the other direction, but that's at a _much_ higher blocksize.
