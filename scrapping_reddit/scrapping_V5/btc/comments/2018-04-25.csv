"**Agorism**

Agorism is a libertarian social philosophy that advocates creating a society in which all relations between people are voluntary exchanges by means of counter-economics, thus engaging with aspects of peaceful revolution. It was first proposed by libertarian philosopher Samuel Edward Konkin III at two conferences, CounterCon I in October 1974 and CounterCon II in May 1975, both conferences organized by J. Neil Schulman.

Invalid segwit transactions are valid under old block rules. They are not valid under new block rules.

An upgrade was needed on miners or else they'd risk mining invalid segwit transactions, and have their block dropped by other miners that'd reject the invalid segwit transaction. A segwit-unaware (older) miner could mine transactions that other miners would consider invalid.

"Ok I can see that you genuinely don't understand so  I'll give it one last go. A ""fork"" in the context of a blockchain is when there are two child blocks mined on top of the same parent block. That's it.

It can happen for lots of different reasons: two miners using the same consensus rules find a block at the same time; or one miner uses tightened consensus rules (a soft fork); or one miner uses loosened consensus rules (a hard fork).

Your description of a code repository fork is correct, but it is not the same thing as a blockchain fork. You can have a code fork without a blockchain fork, and likewise you can have a blockchain fork without a code fork. You can also have both a code fork and a blockchain fork, which is what happened (although not at the same time) with Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.

"A soft-fork, by definition, is a fork where certain previously valid transactions are no longer valid. A soft-fork makes it so that an old client can't send new transactions, but can receive new blocks. Miners will be in direct competition, as if the new chain ever becomes longer it'll override the old chain (since it's shorter and the new chain is valid). It favors the upgrade, as the new chain will win unless the old chain has significantly more hashpower. Nodes on the new version will drop transactions made by clients on the old version.

A hard-fork, by definition, is a fork where certain previously invalid transactions become valid. A hard-fork makes it so that an old client can send transactions, but can't receive new blocks. Miners will be in direct competition, as if the old chain ever becomes longer it'll override the new chain (since it's shorter and the old chain is valid). It favors the current state, as the old chain will win unless the new chain has significantly more hashpower. Nodes on the old version will drop transactions made by clients on the new version.

Quite literally, the only difference between a soft-fork and a hard-fork is whether it's invalid transactions being made valid (hard-fork), or old transactions being made invalid (soft-fork).

If you do both (so that you actually split into two chains), it's generally also called a hard-fork, but it technically isn't, it's both a soft-fork and a hard-fork.

> Because that has never happened and there were many soft forks already.

Happened multiple times. BIP66, P2SH, BIP12, are just a few examples where miners would reject transactions that were previously valid, and non-mining nodes would silently drop them and not propagate them. If a miner mined a block, all the miners on the new version would ignore it if it wasn't the new version. All of those were contentious soft-forks that were upheld through a sybil attack that stopped miners from having their blocks propagated.";8;2;False;Okymyo;dxwyc2q;Bitcoin Cash is upgrading on May 15 to 32MB max block limit;8el8n7;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8el8n7/bitcoin_cash_is_upgrading_on_may_15_to_32mb_max/

"> Shouldn't you guys be focusing on optimizing the code base instead of just increasing the block size?

The 8MB consensus limit (just like the 1MB limit of BTC) is *arbitrary*.  Removing it *does* optimize the code base.  The next limit (of 32MB) is a technical limit due to the way network messages were encoded by Satoshi.  So, the developers agree with you that ""optimizing"" the code base has value, and are doing exactly that.";13;0;False;primitive_screwhead;dxwyc28;Bitcoin Cash is upgrading on May 15 to 32MB max block limit;8el8n7;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8el8n7/bitcoin_cash_is_upgrading_on_may_15_to_32mb_max/

"Each mined block can hold up to 32 MB of transactions. 

Assuming each transaction is roughly 250 bytes (they vary), there are about 4,000 transactions in 1 MB. 

This means that the new block size of 32 MB can hold about 128,000 transactions per block.

Assuming a block every 10 minutes, this translates to about 213 transactions per second. The 8MB it is upgrading from are able to handle about 53 transactions per second.
