"These arguments are so common I came up with a form to respond to them.

    Your argument that big blocks can't work is based on the following belief(s):
    
    (X) Storage of big blocks is impossible
    ( ) Validating big blocks is impossible
    ( ) Networks can't transfer big blocks
    ( ) Bigger blocks cause centralization
    
    Your argument is flawed because:
    
    (X) Disk is cheap and easily available
    ( ) CPU power is cheap and easily available
    ( ) Network bandwidth is cheap and easily available
    ( ) Miners only need a block header, they don't need to sync the entire blockchain to each miner
    ( ) Node count proves nothing
    
    Furthermore:
    
    ( ) Not all users need to run a full node
    (X) Not all nodes need to store the entire blockchain
    ( ) The belief that transaction fees must cost a significant proportion of a full node is flawed
    ( ) The belief that Blocksteam or the bitcoin core group has the best programmers is flawed
    (X) There is no reason to believe that bigger blocks cause centralization
    ( ) Using 'avoiding centralization' as a reason whilst supporting a fully centralized development team is flawed
    ( ) It's your job to prove your arguments, see Russell's teapot

I’m not saying it’s a good thing, I’m wondering how it will all play out and I’m just excited to see where bitcoin goes. Basically what I am saying is still today the best way to use bitcoin is to buy as much as you possible can and just hold it. Use fiat or other coins for trade since the return on holding far outweighs any advantage you could get from trading(for the average user). And does that hurt it’s use case as a currency? Maybe not, I’m sure there’s a lot I’m missing and hopefully it will all be figured out in time. ;0;2;False;;dpo93c9;Gavin Andresen on Twitter: Bitcoin Cash is what I started working on in 2010: a store of value AND means of exchange.;7c94ze;https://twitter.com/gavinandresen/status/929377620000681984

Keep in mind that Gavin never wanted to lead Bitcoin in the first place, and that's why he handed over the reins prematurely to someone who turned out to be disastrous for the project. That happened because Gavin was not interested in a sole leadership position. Some people — often very brilliant people — do not covet leadership positions, and I think we should allow them to make their own decisions in that regard. Just my opinion though.

Nah, I disagree, because first of all, I like what he's doing now and I think he should keep doing it. Pure research is key. Secondly, I'm a strong believer that the maximum societal efficiency is achieved when humans are permitted to self-organise, and to choose what are the best roles for themselves without outside pressure, instead of having a role thrust upon them — for much the same reason that the market achieves maximum efficiency when merchants are allowed to set prices however they wish, and people are allowed to spend money however they choose, or even not spend it at all.;7;0;False;;dpohnf4;Gavin Andresen on Twitter: Bitcoin Cash is what I started working on in 2010: a store of value AND means of exchange.;7c94ze;https://twitter.com/gavinandresen/status/929377620000681984

I'm all for innovation via alt-coins. I'm doing this myself by working on a bunch of privacy layers around smart contracts. However there is a fundamental difference between an alt coin and an alt fork, where the number of limited coins is immediately doubled. Alt-forks should be attacked with dump sales on exchanges, followed by a 51% attack that forges emptying the exchange wallets holding the altfork. Alt-forks are immoral and wrong.

"Hey, I totally get what you are saying. 

The reason why I made the statement about ""core devs"" is because I had literally went to a bitcoin dev meetup with Greg Maxwell attending in San Francisco,  and in the conversations that I had overheard and had with him, it really seemed like Greg, and other Core devs were wishy washy about the whole thing. 

They basically admitted that they were pro-POW change, but understood that this was controversial, and were unwilling to go on  the record to support it. 

If it had not been because of these in person conversations that I had had with them, then I would have not made these claims.

I think this is why I got banned.  They DO support a POW change, but understand that it is extremely controversial.

"If BCH is successful enough that it manages to maintain a majority of hash power, or at least the oscillations prove disruptive enough for BTC, I will not be surprised at all if they ratchet up FUD of it being an attack by miners and pull a PoW fork ""to save bitcoin.""    

Their censored forums and variety of core-biased resources around the web have done a masterful job of reframing the discussion to be on their terms.   People take for granted that BCH is centralized.   They take for granted that core are the only people skilled enough to develop the software.  They take for granted that BTC will hold value indefinitely while having limited utility and high fees.   People wear their dragons den hats with pride.   

Its a lot like Fox news, but in a world where Rupert Murdoch also bought the New York Times and Twitter.   People like being followers because they're uncomfortable thinking for themselves.   People naturally seek an authority to give them the certainty that they're following the right path.   I have every confidence their propaganda machine can find a way to sell PoW fork.    Once finished, they'll slam BCH for wasting electricity.

"and hopefully now you will be another believer on why Bitcoin Core is a huge huge huge bubble, that judging by the market today might be popping very soon.

If they were right they wouldn't need to censor anyone, they just don't want people telling the truth to all the suckers believing whatever they say out of pure greed. bubble mentality on that sub.

If anybody has a full Bitcoin-Core node running, it'd be nice to get all the ids of rawmempool transactions and do a histogram of the output addresses, then see what percentage of the over 60k backlogged transactions are deposits to exchanges of people that are ready to dump.

"It's a site wide problem. Reddit admins don't give a fuck about how the mods behave since they're doing their job for free. Unfortunately most of the people attracted to the mod positions are power hungry little cunts who enjoy shitting down people's throats and being rude to users.

I got permanently banned from r/writingprompts the other day for saying something along the lines of ""wow, this prompt sure gets posted a lot"" and was promptly banned despite not saying anything rude. I politely asked if my permanent ban could be reduced to a temporary one (even going so far as to agree if they felt I deserved the ban then I was happy with a temporary one) but they instead chose to rudely berate me in their reply and then started to ignore me.

The real kicker is that mod chat is now set up so that users can't see which mod they are communicating with, giving the mods another layer of protection to hide behind.

So I can tell you with certainty that nothing is going to change, and if you want to continue posting in r/bitcoin then just make a new account. As long as you don't go around saying ""I made this account to get around my shitty unfair ban"" nobody is going to know and nobody will do anything about it.

"Funny and stupid story. I don't.

I bought BTC on Coinbase. They closed my account. Made a big post on /Coinbase/ about it. 

It's the best thing they ever did for me. They allowed me to transfer funds out for FREE (saved a few grand in fees). They never gave explanation as to why. However, my thought process is because I owned so much BTC, they probably just wanted to shaft me from the January 1 BCH integration, and getting my free monies.



 It forced me to download Exodus. I was done buying anyways. Now, I just Shapeshift and hold the funds on my wallet. Big woop, I paid a little extra on Shapeshift than going thru an Exchange.



As mentioned, Im done buying. I just move freely from one coin to another, but am now staying with BCH.

"Classic pump before the dump. To quote someones observations:

Just let the numbers sink in:

* Entire market cap trades in 3 days, while most of the BCH still sitting idle on addresses of early BTC adopters.
* New supply is just 0.036% of daily volume and BCH believers claim to hodl onto their coins and to buy more
* Even if the free float is 10% (coins sitting on these exchanges and are actively traded), it means each BCH is traded at least 3 times per day.

Bottom line: someone is playing games here.

- contradicting satoshi who created bitcoin (as if core know better)

I don't own btc ór bch yet. I just want crypto to succeed for all of our benefit. Btc has proven it can carry crypto on it's back already, why take the chance to ruin that with something unproven? Most people don't give a shit about one coin or the other, they only care about the coin they currently have or will make them the most profit.
Proven facts: btc high fees it still pumps. Btc long confirmation times it still pumps. Btc loose 50% miners it still pumps.
Maybe, perhaps maybe, it would be in all our best interest to let btc take on fiat first by being the safest store of value we currently have and try to take as much of gold's marketshare as possible.(i do have gold btw...)
And when btc liquidity and trust and fame is even much much higher we can have a look at what other technology is available for using it as cash also and try to reach consensus about what the best option is, or just start a NON-contencious fork.(which shouldn't be a problem if your that convinced the idea is better.

If they were using general computers, then they could mine *any* coin including altcoins, and they probably would, if it were more profitable. But because they have such dedicated equipment, they can only mine SHA256, which at present includes Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. That's why the two are fighting for the same pool of miners. It has nothing to do with 'longest chain' or Nakamoto consensus mechanisms.

However, it does make things very inconvenient for the coin that most of the miners abandoned, because the mining difficulty will end up too high and need to be adjusted prematurely. Which is not that hard to do, but it is still a great PR victory.

You are describing Fractional reserve banking. I learned about this before you were born, most likely...

The banking scheme will have 2 parts/options:

a) Non-borrowing: that's the Liquidity Provider part. There will be an extra time-dependent ""fee"". That's an interest rate.

b) With borrowing: It is very easy to imagine that you could be ""invited"" or ""allowed"" on some channel, where a whale node will either transfer funds to you for you to spend (with a interest-like fee), or will spend the money on your behalf (with an interest-like fee). Of course there will not be money creation. It is a given that the sum of fee movements on a channel or even cross channel, will always be ZERO. That we agree on it.

What I do not understant that you do not understand is this: why do you not see that when a third party provides you with liquidity, you have to PAY for it. Again, this is about opportunity cost, That third party could have productively invested that money elsewhere, but insted, he is investing it on you... well, you gotta pay up.

'Banking scheme' is complete crap - banks create money through debt. LN creates nothing - every Bitcoin is tied to the main chain. 

LN lets you sum up the difference at the the end of a series of back and forth payments between parties and commit the difference to the blockchain.

If you and I were playing cards and we both put $5 in at the start and we were paying each other after each hand in Bitcoin over the blockchain we would waste a lot of money on fees for each tx. If we instead noted how much you and I had after each hand and then submitted the final totals up at the end of our game - that is how the LN works.

If you want a 'non-ELI5' explanation go do you own reading instead of accepting the thoughts of people who know no more than you do but just present it as if they do.";0;2;False;wintercooled;dpnpb8d;Blockstream investor emails leaked - shows Blockstream motivation to steal transaction fees from miners and pay to Liquid sidechain customers;7c29kk;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7c29kk/blockstream_investor_emails_leaked_shows/

"> akin to an interest rate

No - it is akin to paying fees as we currently do now. If you don't want to use a channel you don't have to. It is a second option for sending Bitcoin. You would have to pay a fee for a service provided, exactly that same as you do currently on Bitcoin. 

>With this banking scheme in place, KYC and AML are going to be mandatory, trust me on that

Banks created money out of thin air through the creation of debt. In NO WAY is LN similar to banking. Every Bitcoin transacted over LN is tied to the main chain.

Anyone can run a LN node.

The primary purpose of banks is to create money from debt. No additional Bitcoin can ever be created by the Lightning Network - all balances are tied to a transaction on the blockchain.

The second-biggest breach of a Bitcoin exchange platform, Bitfinex, caused 120,000 units of the cryptocurrency bitcoin, which was valued at $72 million at the time, to be stolen. Bitfinex first announced the security breach on August 2, 2016. The bitcoin was taken from users' segregated wallets and Bitfinex has been tracking down the hack. Significant hacker funds transactions were signed off by Bitfinex's security provider, without full security.

Looks like Segwit itself was the real suicide.  Degrading the incentive balance of BTC just to fix transaction malleability, quadratic complexity issue, and give it a little capacity boost - I think that was a poor decision.  The viability of a chain is not only a function of its current state, but of its forking potential as well, which gives an nondegraded blockchain a distinct advantage.

This is what I did months ago. I have always expected bitcoin core to go down in price and bitcoin cash to go up in price until a equilibrium between the two is found. I mean it's a fork and miners now mine on both chains. They are linked together. And then I hold ETH as a backup, it's the most price stable of all alt coins and it offers a lot of things that bitcoin does not have. It's way more then just money. Ethereum is also incredibly complex so it might takes years before it reaches any potential but I think it's fundamentals are as strong as Bitcoin. I would not be surprised if the prices reaches a 1000 US within the next two years maybe even faster, who knows.

You are right. Bitcoin Cash did do this. It was however the only change that they have made to the original design. They removed all the other changes that really hurts bitcoins usability. RBF, Segwit, and a crippled blocksize. It is easy to look at the two and see which one is Bitcoin and which is something that has been morphed into something else. We just proved gigabyte blocks work. This bullshit that core has been spreading has been proven to be lies and the only thing they had to hold onto is the original chain. Once they hard fork they lose the original chain and any credibility they had. With two hard forks then people must actually look at facts to determine which is bitcoin rather then blindly following the orignal chain.

The king is dead... or at least dying. If *half* of what we've all read is true, then it's only a matter of months before BCH will have the majority market cap in the crypto-sphere.

Edit: thanks for the downvotes. Word to the wise, get out of BTC while you still can. I got extremely lucky and converted all my BTC to BCH before the (failed) fork. Or, you can just *hodl* until to goes to $5000, or $4000, or $2500, or $1200, or $700... you get the idea.

"rbtc trolls are celebrating the man who singlehandedly drove Satoshi away from the project, when he went on to present bitcoin to the CIA.

The same man who along with Hearn, of GCHQ started the coordinated push for big blocks back in 2015

The same person that got ""bamboozled"" by Fake Satoshi, a person that not only contributed nothing to the ecosystem but has no coding abilities whatsoever

Rbtc, I am proud of you. You choose your role models wisely. From Ver, to Wu, to Wright, to Garzik, now to Gavin, le creme de la creme of the cryptoworlds are flocking there.
