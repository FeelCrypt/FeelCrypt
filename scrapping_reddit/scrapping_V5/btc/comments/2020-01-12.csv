~~No, it is not. Bitcoin was created to be cash. Money. Currency.~~

~~It already failed to be that and that's why fools rebranded to SOV aka speculation.~~

Edited as it is not answer to your statement. If speculation is at the heart of most crypto than unfortunately it means there is no other use for them or it is sadly secondary. Nothing to cheer for though.

>The reason why Bitcoin has survived and thrived in all this speculation is that the markets approve of its direction and security.

Bitcoin survived, but it definitely is not thriving. It is coin in decline and no purpose other than siphoning money from fools. In current manipulated market that is exactly what is happening and some of parts of ""the market"" indeed approve that. Some are simply plain, stupid and unaware they are being slowly robbed from money. Not to mention, already robbed from purpose.

>This is why Bitcoin is the most widely used crypto globally for payments.

"I looked into Kraken recently (I’m U.K.). Although trading fees are lower than Coinbase, the fiat deposit fee is higher and the BTC price is higher, so you actually get less BTC for your money (at least for the amounts I typically purchase).

"Yes it is. You can transfer your deposit from Coinbase to Coinbase Pro for free (no fees) and instantly.

[https://pro.coinbase.com](https://pro.coinbase.com)

If you already have a Coinbase account, it is very easy to set up Coinbase Pro. You already have an account.

Personally, I still use Coinbase consumer frontend, or ""customer portal,"" for deposits and withdrawals, as well as the Vault functionality, and I transfer assets to Coinbase Pro for instant trading with much lower fees.  If you are doing trades regularly, it is going to be to your benefit to identify all of the points where fees can be assessed, and find ways to minimize them, but this strategy by itself is a good start without too much hassle.

You may find outdated advice that says there are 0% fees for limit orders (""maker"") on Coinbase Pro or GDAX (they are the same, GDAX went through a name change, but it has always been a facet of Coinbase Inc.) – there are fees for both limit and market orders today (""maker"" and ""taker""), they are about equal, but they are comparatively very low when compared to the fees on [Coinbase.com](https://Coinbase.com) simplified frontend interface for consumers.

Here is the fee schedule for Coinbase Pro: [https://support.pro.coinbase.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2945310-what-are-the-fees-on-coinbase-pro-](https://support.pro.coinbase.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2945310-what-are-the-fees-on-coinbase-pro-)

Others have already linked the fee schedule for Coinbase Customer Portal, this should look favorable by comparison. If you are doing low volume transactions (less than $50,000 per trade), then there is no difference between the fee you will pay as a maker or a taker, it's going to be about a half percent, with volume discounts that favor makers if'n you are a baller.";4;1;False;yebyen;fe31yra;19.19€ as Coinbase fee for buying 2 BCH?;enn4sb;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/enn4sb/1919_as_coinbase_fee_for_buying_2_bch/

"Yes. On Coinbase Pro the fee for small buyers is 0.5 %. On Coinbase, the fee is 1.5 %. On top of that comes the credit card fees on Coinbase. Coinbase Pro is the exchange of Coinbase, Coinbase is basically the app and backend.
