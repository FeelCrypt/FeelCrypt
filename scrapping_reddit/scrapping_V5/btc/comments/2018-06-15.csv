This is not the problem you know that if someone want to say something more, he/she can do it elsewhere, independently of any censure. 

The question should be: what's the reason of censoring an ongoing discussion on that sub/thread/subject/case specifically ? 

I am not sure if you see the uncomfortable situation you are in when you insinuate that the censure was based on a : "" you don't have anything to say more than what was said."" 

Is it the moderator's job to decide on behalf of ppl about what to express on a given subject? Does it cost something to the sub if a discussion lasts thousand of posts? Or maybe,  was there any threat to the sub regarding the thread's popularity it was gaining and the opinion which was expressed ?

"Hey mate - seeing as this has all drawn so much discussion - the team are going to address the properly with a post.

I can easily say that if hadn’t been linked and brigaded by this subreddit it probably would still be up. I wasn’t really around during the week that happened, but I don’t believe the team did anything with ill intention. 

Personally I can say that I don’t want to encourage the constant fighting between r/BTC and r/bitcoin I mean r/cryptocurrency isn’t a battleground for this... it makes the whole space look petty and unprofessional. 

Equally I think there have been posts about BCH that got to the front page that seemed to just attack the project. There’s obviously a lot of debate about the process of claiming the title of bitcoin. Anytime there is a post made about BTC or BCH both subreddits come in and attack each other. It’s just not healthy and in reality both are completely guilty of baiting each other and refusing to listen to reasonable discussion points.

Honestly I just want r/cryptocurrency to be about crypto news and discussion to promote the growth and adoption for everyone.

I personally don’t have any issues with any coins, even if I’m treated like shit by members of their communities. 

Our subreddit is very unique as it is used to discuss multiple currencies under one roof, so it’s very complex and difficult to manage and quite often someone is upset about a decision either way. 

People from each community accuse us of being paid off or puppets from their “competitors” so it’s nothing new.

What you don’t hear about is all the good work that we spend hours doing, who ever shouts the loudest seems to get attention and often they are shouting because of something they don’t agree with. 

I would love to see our level of transparency and communication from all crypto subs, I’m responding to all these comments today to help provide a clearer picture against so much false information.

I didn’t want the team to be doxxed or compromised, as we were pretty shaken and it felt like the right thing to do in that moment.

For the longest time, I honestly believed them, I’d never visit Bitcoin.com and I always felt this distrust towards it. Then one day, I followed jessquit (before he was banned) from rBitcoin to here, and my eyes were opened.

"I would agree with you that there is hardly any positive discussion about BCH. I simply can’t control that or stop the community from despising it - which a lot of them seem to do.

Honestly there are plenty of other coins where their own respective subreddits are full of positive news but they aren’t well received on r/cc it’s not a unique aspect of BCH. 

I’ve read plenty of opinions as to why this is the case, from both sides of the fence. It seems to really come down to the attitudes of certain people in the community and those who represent the project - not so much the tech - which is hugely disappointing because it’s not an honest discussion just an emotional one.

I don’t agree that mods are favouring any coins even if it appears that way, as you say. 

One thing you also need to be conscious of is both of the communities using sock puppet accounts to bait each other in those threads - or if one community links to the post and encourages brigading then it gets removed.

I have absolutely no issue with reading BCH news on the subreddit and I would encourage everyone here to post more of it - there’s obviously a certain sensitivity to the use of using the term “bitcoin” on both sides. Using the Ticker symbol seems to be the best way to avoid that argument.

"I’m personally against mods displaying personal interest in controversial topics, however if our mods here are guilty, they’re guilty of one thing: their uncapped and unstoppable love for the Bitcoin which Satoshi Nakamoto created. I’ll forever excuse their (non-violent) actions when driven by that passion.

I think the only reason you see this post here is because historically the subreddit you mod have displayed obvious leaning towards the r/Bitcoin’s corporate-interest-driven narrative, often aiding their censorship efforts in silencing any info describing what Bitcoin Cash really is. 

And here I mean historically allowing obvious brigading from the rBitcoin puppet-army until it’s a pro-BCH post, then you falsely claim brigading as to snuff the post. 

We never brigade, we share the truth where it matters, with facts quoted right under it. And when finally something like that takes place and the slimy mods @ rBitcoin are exposed yet again, this time naked and in public, your mod team rushes to save them.

"Coming across this thread was pretty hilarious to me, here's my take on it:

- I got asked to mod /r/cc about 6 months back. I originally said no, I didn't have the time and I had a lot on my plate. I would shitpost there a lot and report (a lot) of things. 2 months later they asked me again, so I said yes.
- When I got in, I had never seen such a mess. There was stuff in the modqueue that dated back 3 months (Literally, back into December, from February) . Stuff in Modmail that was 3 months old. Hundreds of modmails.  It was obvious something was wrong in terms of activity or something, I'd never seen anything like it.
- I ran a toolbox action for mod actions. [Here it is, minus the names for privacy](https://i.imgur.com/Ulzh8GP.png) - This is actions in the month I joined and the month beforehand.
- You'll notice there were **21 accounts with less than 100 actions in 2 months time.** 6 accounts which did 0, which is literally jack shit. One account was *suspended from Reddit*. The number on top is automod. Obviously there was a big inactivity problem.

So it's not really a nefarious plot. There were literally dozens of inactive people not doing a damn thing - The top moderators are inactive and are part of this group.

There are plenty of things to be paranoid about, including moderators wanting to push their agenda for a favoured coin of theirs, or people having permissions who delete only certain posts - Some of that's been dealt with in my short time here. They've gotten the boot and the behaviour's been corrected.

/r/cryptocurrency is a weird space. Literally everyone is trying to manipulate it in some way, for exposure, for pushing an agenda, or for whatever purpose they might have in mind. 

But there's really nothing nefarious going on behind the scenes. Lots of boring things, like explaining that people need 100 comment karma (because of shill accounts that attempt to shill nonstop every day) or canning vote manipulators that want to push the latest ICO onto people.

"I wouldn't say 'they' have dug their heels in. The software (thus the coin/network) was called bitcoin from the beginning. I call it bitcoin to avoid confusion.

In regards to your dollar example, it's a actually  good example against your naming conventions. Believe it or not the US dollar is not The dollar, the original dollar come from Joachim's valley/dale (German translation) from the Czech Kingdom of Bohemia. Their coin was named after this valley, which got shortened to 'talor' (English translation being dollar). The first major copy was the Dutch 'lion daler'.

And here is the important point: the Dutch gave it there own name be appending 'lion', just like what bitcoin cash did with the 'cash'. The original Czech talor (dollar) never changed their name as they didnt need too.

As a side note I like the fact that there is hundreds of versions of the Bitcoin Core software and Bitcoin ABC is one of its many new children.

"Right. So everything that humans produce is made on the back of other things that humans have produced. The English language and the alphabet and everything else has roots in other things that have roots in other things. You are glad that there are many versions of bitcoin now. As am I. But your argument is what again exactly? That Bitcoin Cash shouldn't be called ""Bitcoin"" Cash? 
Or is your main point only that the BTC chain should forever and always be only ""bitcoin""? Where is this Bohemian dollar now? Is the original no more? What is your stance on other countries also using the word ""dollar"" in their name? Does it bother you that they need to have a distinction when the context is not clear?

"Well ticker symbols can also get mixed up and are no sure fire way. Bitcoin 2x made a concerted effort to take BTC ticker but failed. Also remember the BCC Bitcoin Cash/Bitconnect mix up. I actually think binance still lists Bitcoin Cash as Bitconnect.

Im happy there are many versions of Bitcoin Core software (not the Bitcoin network), see the difference? I think we have had this talk before about the software/network differential.

All dollars now are differentiated by country prefix which is perfectly fine. The original dollar is no more because the old centralised money is attached to nation states (when was the last time you heard the 
Kingdom of Bohemia come up in the news? :) ).

So to summarise my points, there is no requirement to rename Bitcoin as Bitcoin Cash is differentiated by appending 'cash' to its name. If we were to follow your renaming conventions we would be changing the names of our networks/tokens nearly every week.

BTW: I will happily trade you as many Australian dollars for your US dollars (1:1), and by the by, accept as many of your Bitcoin for each Bitcoin Cash I have.

> You can't just ignore this connection and claim that Blockstream, Core, and BTC development are not closely linked.

you don't say! a company that is planing to earn money! scandal! ;-) 

> their profit model is dependent on the BTC chain retaining a small blocksize. This is an overt conflict of interest

on the contrary, it is crucial for the bitcoin network to stay decentralized. blockstream, among many other companies, is committed to that goal. i'm very happy to see all the work done on layer 2 technologies because those are the future of scaling. you can go ahead with your on-chain approach, but you will come to realize that the logical consequence will be master nodes, controlled by a centralized mining cartel. good bye fungibility and censorship resistance!

"Thanks for your response. I'm not out to crucify anyone, I just say what I see.

>why are you not participating in the technical discourse instead?

Where did you get that idea? Several times per week I explain to people why Lightning likely will never work and/or won't be adopted. It's not a hate thing, it's just reality. In 2 years everyone will know this, but right now only technical people can evaluate claims and make empirical observations. As an intelligent person you should probably consider that LN's failure is the likely outcome.

Sidechains are totally unnecessary and unproven technology. Thousands of altcoins exist, and they are already performing the function that sidechains were intended for, and they're far less complicated and leverage the existing exchange infrastructure. When the BTC blocks got full, fees got high, and transactions wouldn't confirm, the laws of economics kicked in. BTC dropped to below 40&#37; dominance from 98&#37; in 6 months because the dev team was compromised. And it will keep falling as more and more merchants ditch BTC. Blockstream and the Core devs have NO PUBLIC SPOKESPERSON. They simply can't admit their real plan (but Adam Back pretty much did in the Forbes article, and Samson Mao seemed very nervous when things got real).

Bitmain supported BCH devs with money. That's different from Blockstream taking over the existing Core dev team, roadmap, and infrastructure, then isolating and driving out all of the original members one by one.

>it is crucial for the bitcoin network to stay decentralized. blockstream, among many other companies, is committed to that goal.

Sorry but that is a talking point that really has been debunked so many times.  A corporation that makes patented products to ""scale"" on top of a network that they've deliberately crippled is hardly a ""commitment to decentralization"".  And there is no metric to measure decentralization, it's rather mystical if you think about it. The only resource that has even attempted such a task is [https://arewedecentralizedyet.com/](https://arewedecentralizedyet.com/)

... which concludes that BTC and BCH are roughly equally decentralized. Ripple stands out as incredibly centralized, as any technical person already knows, given that they're simply printing ""Funbux"" without any mining or equitable distribution.

"Inactive is all a relative term.  You can argue that if major changes are happening to the userbase due to explosive growth and major changes in policies... perhaps a semi-active mod might not be up to speed with the rest of the moderator team.

Still, somebody who is checking in on a regular basis can act as a check on those who are doing the heavy lifting and might be a tad bit overzealous.

I've been a moderator on some pretty big forums before, and my experience is that in almost every case where you toss out moderators due to low activity is usually trouble and the minor annoyance that can come from somebody inactive to back in full activity usually can be cleaned up quite quickly compared to kicking out people who still have a whole lot to contribute.

The very minor issue of somebody hacking into the account of an inactive moderator is just that:  something so rare that it isn't worth bothering to deal with and can usually be cleaned up quickly too.

"> unfortunately you can't really have any pro-BTC or anti BCH talk here without being attacked and down-voted though

The classic ""both sides are equally bad"" fallacy comparing downvotes to censorship.  First, it's important to establish that downvotes here have very little to do with supporting different opinions.  I'd challenge you to find some examples of what you claim.

From what I've seen, people downvote BTC comments that are made in bad faith or make false claims.  The same way anti-vaccer comments get downvoted in pro-science subs.  Genuine questions or evidence-backed claims, regardless of conclusion, tend to contribute to the conversation and get up

It's not because the pro-science people are all just biased and unbalanced against other opinions on vaccines.  It's because the anti-vax people are wrong.  And their arguments are wrong.  Some because they're lying, some because they lack the ability to differentiate reality from fiction, and some because they're simply misinformed.  In you're in the latter category, you'll get plenty of balanced, factual, evidence-based expert advice and opinion on BTC and BCH without hostility or downvotes.  In you're in the former groups, you'll probably just complain about bias and seek out the anti-vax bubbles for ""more balance"".";3;1;False;Uber_Nick;e0ot65g;Mods at /r/cryptocurrency have CENSORED the post with 2000 upvotes exposing /r/Bitcoin.;8qqcbr;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8qqcbr/mods_at_rcryptocurrency_have_censored_the_post/

Why because old inactive mod accounts had been hacked before leading to ref links being secretly placed in the sidebar, and he was an inactive mod?

"I have to side with the mods on this one. I was an active mod at the time. Not only was there a month + notice about the vote to check in, /u/We_are_all_satoshi was notified about it and still did not respond (he really didnt do much modding anyway, he was largely absent). 

>Why on earth would you remove mods for nothing but low activity?

Because inactive mod accounts have been hacked before. Its part of the reason I stepped down, I was becoming an absent mod and I was tired of having my accounts constantly having attempts made on them, my gmail accounts, etc. So then the sidebar got hacked and all the exchange links replaced to ref links, and then a mod got hacked again.

So why remove mods for low activity?

Why wouldn't you?  It's not like there's some disadvantage to having extra mods that aren't as active.
