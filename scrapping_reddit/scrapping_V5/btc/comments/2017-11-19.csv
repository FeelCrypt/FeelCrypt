It's a false premise there are cheap and fast ways to send money both from outside of the Philippines and inside the Philippines. Very cheap and a hell of a lot more convenient the BCH/BTC whatever and no where near 40% fees. Total nonsense. I live in the Philippines (from America). The BTC/PHP rate given by the exchanges are shit anyway, even without fees. And yes, using a foreign ATM card from Charles Schwab is one of the best ways. No ATM fees (they refund them) and the exact Visa exchange rate which is very close to the wholesale, it doesn't get any better than this. www.transferwise.com is also great. Stop using supposedly disenfranchised poor people to promote crypto, it's nonsense. The people who don't have accounts here do so not because they can't, they just don't know any better and have no use for it often. They need education more than crypto fucking currency. Rookies. The idiot in that screenshot is using a standard wire transfer that's about the worst way to send money to anyone in any country. In the Philippines there are 100's of options better than this. In fact I don't even believe that poster really send money to his mother that way, EVERYONE here knows better ways than a freaking wire-transfer.
