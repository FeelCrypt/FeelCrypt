"Well I think [this article with Dr Craig Wright](https://coingeek.com/craig-wright-on-bitcoin-scalability/) does a great job of winning this argument.  He also addresses your point of fraud proofs:

> Now, the first thing we need to understand is that all encryption systems are probabilistic. Password systems and any modern information security system works on probabilistic information. The so-called experts who talk about the probabilistic system of bitcoin fail to comprehend that strong encryption is probabilistic.

> Fraud proofs and nowhere near as difficult as anyone thinks. They do not require some special cryptographic protocol. They are far simpler to implement than anyone seems to understand.

> The solution is incredibly simple. All you need to do is randomly select a series of nodes on the network and query whether the inclusion of your transaction has occurred on that node. Each query would be random. Using a simple Bayesian algorithm, we could use a failure model to analyse the likelihood of a double spend or other attack.” – Dr Craig Wright

"Here's the abridged version.  

Bitcoin blocks are created about once every 10 minutes.  The Bitcoin block contains all the transactions that happened since the last block was created.  

There is a limit that each block can only be 1MB in size.  This was added by Satoshi as a spam filter, so a bad person couldn't flood the network with gigabyte-size blocks and grind things to a halt.  The idea was we would change or remove the limit when we got close to hitting it.  

As Bitcoin becomes more popular and more people use it, that means more transactions happen every 10 minutes, which means more data to pack into each block.  Once we hit about 3-4 transactions per second, that will create about 1MB of block data every 10 mins.  

Since 2012, we've known this would be a problem.  Since 2012, people like Gavin Andresen have been trying to get the limit raised.  The people in charge of Bitcoin-Core development have never agreed to do this, because not everybody would agree that it should be raised, or because people are worried that raising it would cause a problem, or because insert the reason of the week.  

In 2014, Gavin went around the Bitcoin-Core devs and released his own software called Bitcoin-XT.  It had a code that when 75% of the miners started using it, it would raise the block size.  
The moderator of /r/bitcoin and bitcointalk forums (a guy called Theymos) decided that XT was bad, so he would try to kill it using the moderator power he had.  So he decreed that since XT isn't fully compatible with Core, it's not Bitcoin, and thus prohibited advocating it on /r/Bitcoin or bitcointalk.  Lots of people got banned.  That's why /r/btc was created.  

Anyway long story short- after XT started to gain traction, someone started DDoS attacking all XT nodes so it was killed.  A bit later there was another more conservative proposal called Bitcoin Classic.  When it picked up steam, a few Core devs flew to China to meet with miners, they banged out an agreement that SegWit (Core's answer to scaling) would be released soon and a 2MB block size upgrade would follow from Core.  Miners agreed and dropped Classic.  The deadline was blown, Core never offered a real block size upgrade (the only one came from LukeJr in the form of a proposal that reduced the block size to 300KB then raised it over several years), and even other Core devs called the ones who negotiated ""well meaning dipshits"" who didn't actually have authority to negotiate on behalf of Core.  So Classic died.  
Next came Bitcoin Unlimited.  Unlimited removed the 1MB limit entirely, replacing it with an 'emergent consensus' system whereby miners would each set their own preferred limit and the network would adjust accordingly.  It started to get popular, hitting 50% of the miner support, while SegWit (now finally out) was languishing at 30%.  So that meant another agreement- SegWit2x (aka the NYA agreement).  We'll activate SegWit now, then do a hard fork upgrade to 2MB blocks in November.  SegWit was activated immediately, but the 2x fork (originally scheduled for November 17th) was attacked by Core supporters as a 'corporate takeover' 'hostile attack' etc etc.  Miner support dropped from 95+% to ~80%, exchanges decided to support both sides of the fork (thus making it a split rather than an upgrade), and the fork was recently cancelled.  

So now we're left with a clogged Bitcoin that has doesn't have enough capacity for the transaction load of people trying to use it.  Fees go up, wait times go up, transactions get delayed or dropped.  The Core supporters don't consider this to be a problem.  

OTOH, the Bitcoin Cash people DO consider this to be a problem.  Cash was created on August 1, as a hard fork split from Bitcoin.  Cash has a block size limit of 8MB- plenty for all the users we have today and in the next few years.

They then try to get you to give access to your computer via remote desktop. They then encrypt your drive, and you are supposed to pay ransom to get your hard drive decrypted (or not).

There are videos on Youtube about this (BTW I'm not a racist, I think it's just that people in India are poor and for them, this scamming is a way to survive).

Now the guy in the video called back two such scammers on two different cell phones at the same time, then gets them to talk to each other.

"The *mempool* is basically a holding tank for incoming transactions before being processed by the miners (confirming your transaction and 1000s of others in a block). This is just some memory on a node server with a default limit of 300mb. 

BTC doesn't have the capacity to handle the current amount of incoming transactions, so we are seeing this mempool get filled up with increasing fees (the color bands), which simply means it costs a lot and takes a very long time for your transaction to clear. 

If the network was operating correctly (no block size limitations), the mempool would clear out within every block or two. Cash is able to do this, BTC is not.

"Well we can agree that simple money is not Ethereum's niche, and I hope that Bitcoin Cash can restore the ability of Bitcoin to fill that niche. Some corrections though, since I think Ethereum provides stiff competition just in terms of implementing money:

* There has never been a chain rollback on Ethereum (hopefully it is never necessary). The idea is not at all popular among the community either. There have been at least two in Bitcoin.
* Hashrate is not directly comparable since the PoW algorithm is different. Ethereum has plenty of hash power to be secure however, and since GPUs are still profitable, mining equipment manufacturing is less centralised.
* If you want restricted supply on Ethereum, you can make your own coin on it without reinventing the blockchain.
* Ethereum has much much faster block times (12s vs 15 minutes) and more transaction capacity than Bitcoin. It stores the current state more efficiently because nodes can directly store the current state instead of the UTXO model which becomes unnecessarily complex over time.";7;1;False;hedgepigdaniel;dpqfn8m;Back then I never would have imagined that fees would ever be allowed to rise above $0.20 - Vitalik Buterin on Bitcoin Fees;7ciwzu;https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/929808874265341953

This is not a good attitude to have. Always have an open mind. I used to be of the belief that taxes were for the good of everyone in society as well. The more I learned about how government operates, the wasteful spending on wars all over the world funded by our tax dollars, the preferential treatment that is given to big business and corporations that have politicians in their back pockets, the more I came to the understanding of what taxes really were doing. I have also read a lot on economics and when people have to voluntary enter into transactions with each other, both sides are better off or else they wouldn't perform that transaction.

"The OP_RETURN wars really deserve a revisit. I consider the actions of Greg Maxwell and the usual suspects here as ""Intolerable Acts"": deep injustices which can never be forgiven.

At Counterparty.io, we tried everything under the sun to get the usual suspects of Bitcoin to see why what we were doing was critically important to Bitcoin's continued relevance, but we were constantly labeled spammers, ""altcoin scammers"", and parasites ([literal word choice](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=395761.msg6162434;topicseen#msg6162434)).

They simply would not listen to reason. No amount of evidence could convince them to embrace embedded ledger technology like Counterparty.io.

Of course it quickly came to light the core developers of Bitcoin had cofounded the Blockstream company, had taken *equity in Blockstream*, and planned on launching *sidechains* as the ultimate smart contract solution for Bitcoin. We would later learn sidechains were to become Blockstream's #1 claim to fame, and that those plans had long since been put into action.

I've summarized the many grievances at play there in considerable detail on /r/Decred, a coin which I have chosen to involve myself in solely due to the Intolerable Acts carried out by the current Bitcoin Core developers in the OP_RETURN wars, acts which led directly to the rise of ETH to 90% of BTC's market cap: acts which can never be forgiven or forgotten.

In fact, even though I support what Bitcoin Cash is doing, I have trouble shilling the coin simply because I know it acts as an effective *bailout* for the Blockstream/Core developer team, a team which deserves nothing less than dying broke and penniless for systematically discriminating against Counterparty, causing our project and the Bitcoin project itself BILLIONS of dollars in damage due to lost opportunities, not to mention incalculable brand damage and brain drain.";46;2;False;insette;dpqcpc1;Back then I never would have imagined that fees would ever be allowed to rise above $0.20 - Vitalik Buterin on Bitcoin Fees;7ciwzu;https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/929808874265341953
"This line of argument just doesn't stack up. Ethereum has maintained functional money (storing ETH with a private key/address in the same way as you would in Bitcoin) since its first public release, with no significant bugs. This is in contrast to Bitcoin, which suffered [a consensus bug](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcoin-network-shaken-by-blockchain-fork-1363144448/) where the cleanup required rolling back transactions on one of the forks.

The only things that fell down on Ethereum were more complex applications that Bitcoin has no ability to do (perhaps thanks to OP_RETURN being censored, idk). The DAO for example was a decentralised democratic venture capital firm. Yes Ethereum hard forked to avoid the fallout of that, but at no time was there a significant failure in the basic features it has in common with Bitcoin. It's like claiming that a F1 car is unsafe because one time the driver crashed it at 350km/h and then had an embarrassing black eye.

The only real failure Ethereum had as a currency was once for about one week there was a wait of about a day to get transactions to clear. When you compare that to Bitcoin Core... that one week of congestion is the standard situation.

"Or even 5 cents. The thing for the Cashening is, merchants and consumers (darknet, gamblers, VPN services, etc.) have to *run into problems doing the thing they need to do* in order for them to consider switching. The guy buying his weed needs to think, ""Man, is it really gonna take a $20 fee for this $200 order? Well I can try $5 and wait til tomorrow. And heck even $20 is fine I guess, could just order more at a time. Not like I have a choice, and maybe this is only temporary.""   That's four ways he can adjust and not be concerned enough to figure out what BCH is. Some vendors will probably now be thinking about how the fees are cutting into their bottom line, but maybe they are making enough anyway. Gamblers? OK, fees are a big problem on a platform like SatoshiDice, but on  centralized site where you fund all at once, a $20 one-time fee isn't that painful. At least not enough to switch. The site might consider switching, but they're making bank and so the inertia can be heavy. Everyday merchants? Maybe, but bootstrapping a network effect is hard, and almost no one can be using BTC to pay for things so they probably aren't feeling optimistic. 

We have to re-inspire all those services like VPNs and porn sites and marketplaces. The price rise helps BCH be taken seriously, but it must be followed by massive action on getting the economy going or it won't last. High fees on BTC killed so much; it won't just automatically come back just because fees are low on BCH. And fees can still go higher on BTC while people just deal with it in a lot of the commerce situations, since many are not that fee-sensitive.

"For me, these appear to be symptoms of the fundamental flaw of bitcoin. I mean, originally, it was simple. A digital currency that will be mined until a maximum, and whose mining will be controlled by computing power required to mine, essentially. 

My understanding may be a bit crude and incomplete, but from what i can tell, the currency can have value, because every transaction is checked and verified through a network. Each transaction I believe must carry some sort of history or something like that as part of the legitimacy process. This means that every transaction gets harder and harder to process, the same way that mining gets harder to do. This is a big fundamental problem, since the more transactions you make, the longer it takes to process them to the point it becomes unusable. 

I dont fully understand all of this segwit and bitcoin cash, and and all of that, but if im not mistaken, these forks are desined to alleviate this problem.  but then you end up with multiple different sorts of coin. And I think the probpem will just come back again later.

I may have misunderstood some of that, idk. 

What I dont get, is say I had bitcoin since back when it was worth 700$, what sort of bitcoin do I have, and why isn't that just *the* bitcoin, and scrap the rest?

I'm keen to have a read as well.

My guess is that BCH will by nature of economics naturally overtake BTC.
Most of the great use cases for Bitcoin are for it's use as a transnational cash system. 

BTC now fails at this endeavor. 
BCH has the bitcoin name, but also the spirit of being low transaction fees and speedy transactions.

We need to start helping vendors get into the using BCH. Getting people transacting in BCH. It will naturally grow the coin and the pie for both BCH and BTC.

Maybe we should each try and find a friend.

I follow your conversation with the other poster to this very end, I'd like to say that I really appreciate what you write.

Maybe the other poster is indeed a troll, or maybe they aren't, who knows, but your continued replies to them are beneficial to me.

I'm currently learning about BTC and BCH, and it's especially hard to me because coinbase aren't open to my country of residence.

Cex.io and Coinmama takes forever for verification (not their fault, it's the combination of this country's infrastructure fault, and my fault for not following instruction to the letter), and bitstamp just means I need to use bank transfer which takes days.

So, while all this is going on, I check out some local places and managed to buy a couple dollars worth of BCH finally. I think I'll be in it for the long run, and am currently on level 0 on learning.

Welp, my post went on a tangent, but I'd like to let you know that your effort was not in vain because at least there is another stranger reading it at this very moment.

"The most common method for off chain transactions are at exchanges.  It is very common for an exchange to limit who can participate and in what capacity.  In some cases, a country will be so controlling that they will shut down the exchanges. 

Most newer proposals that I am familiar with for off chain transactions require participating in an off chain distributed network.  If you wanted to transact with another, you'd need to find a node on the network for which both have account balances in place.  Larger nodes would have more accounts.  My concern is that said nodes can implement whatever policies they want in regards to who is able to participate.  I don't like my money being subject to the whims of any controlling agency.  On the flip side, I can understand why these control points are useful for establishing control.    It helps the good guys catch/control the bad guys.  The problem that arises is that my definition of good/bad guys might not match yours.

"Reply. Yes, it is wrong. You would have needed 900sat/byte during the time of one block per hour, where the network was highly overloaded. The fee estimation does not take into account that load is now severely reduced due to increased blockrate.

This is also the reason why there are still 900sat/byte transactions on the queue. They use outdated fee estimations. The only thing interesting in that chart is the lowest band that gets completely reduced to 0 transactions within a few blocks. This is what you should look at.

Any other logic would yield 600sat/byte for bcash as well:

https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/cash/#2h

>(10 transactions with 600 sat/byte or more atm @ bch, or ~0.4% of pending transactions)

"> So https://bitcoinfees.info is wrong? I'm seeing 900sat/byte on the table for 1-3 block conf.


You have to actually look at the orderbook (fee market) and understand how it's trending. 

We only spiked up to 1000 sat\byte yesterday because BCH had a majority of the hashpower because the difficulty adjustment. BTC had 30 minute blocks. That caused a HUGE backup and fees to spike as a result. 

Now miners have returned after the difficulty adjustment (and price decline); so block timing is returning to normal. 

https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/

You can see here that the market is quite thin up until you hit the 750 and 500 sat\byte levels. You need to think of the fee market as a ton of ""bids"", of which when a block is mined, the miners ""market sell"" into it clearing the top layer of best bids. So the ""average"" may be high because a lot of wallet software uses moving averages to calculate fees which doesn't necessarily take into account actual bid depth that you would expect to get a tx confirmed at. 

Welcome to a fee market. It's a pain in the ass and not really necessary currently, but it works.

This is true, but what can we, as a community do about it? Or the developers for that matter. Again this is not an inherit flaw in BCH itself. Just because one big miner decides to stand with BCH no matter what so that he bevomes the 50% when the others leave is unfortunate, but there's nothing anyone can do about it for now.

"It doesn't work when demand spikes. During those times either enough people get despondent and just wait, or there is a boundless bidding war in the dark. Add the randomness of the Poisson process and the potential deep spiral of slow blocks due to mining dynamics and you have a grade-A clusterfuck always lurking in the cards, now periodically bringing commerce to a standstill if there is any real normal commerce left in BTC.

What Gmax never understood is that there are different amounts people are willing to pay for transactions to confirm ASAP. When the chain is full of people who need confirmation ASAP, the fee market is completely broken and fees can skyrocket to hundreds of dollars, even thousands per transaction. We haven't gotten there yet, but we are close. Market dynamics help make it less awful than it would be, but there is no way to win against Poisson variation and the hashrate spiral, as well as natural demand fluctuations that are unknowable. 

The design to keep blocksize cap much lower than demand simply doesn't work. 

However... there is a semantic issue I have just discovered that makes this unnecessarily hard to see: it isn't precise to say ""lower than demand,"" nor is it precise to say ""full blocks"" or ""not full blocks."" Because, as Gmax points out, you can always have someone putting out tons of txs if they are free or cheap. Miners could even put them into the blocks. The thing is they don't, because it costs them a bit to do so in terms of orphan risk (a beautiful example of the market for network resources, which Core fails to recognize partly because of its obsession with ""full nodes,"" which aren't even helpful for the network beyond a few mining and infrastructure nodes that will always be dirt cheap to run from the perspective of the major businesses running them). 

Blocksize is naturally self-limiting and the cap should only be a sanity check if we even have a hardcoded cap at all. That brings me to another semantic issue: miners vote every block so there is no such thing as a hard cap anyway, just Schelling points made slightly less convenient to deviate from by software that has hardcoded caps. 

Putting these semantic fixes together, we can more accurately say that *every* block is always full because miners are always deciding the blocksize themselves. Some of them are just unnaturally full due to the artificial quota created by the inconvenience barrier Core has maintained. 

Gmax changed his emphasis away from the old argument that miners would abuse their power if they were allowed to create bigger blocks, probably because he realized that the only thing stopping them was a hardcoded limit that they could easily change by leaving Core or just modifying the code themselves. He moved over to the argument that full blocks are actually a good thing and they create a fee market that will allow blockspace to be priced rationally. Many of us have been pointing out all along that a fee market already exists without a blocksize limit, and this was famously laid out and demonstrated in concrete detail by Peter Rizun. In fact, the blocksize cap ruins the fee market by tying a millstone around its neck with its artificial intervention. 

Core has always been fighting an unwinnable battle by trying to scare people into following their magic numbers, but the FUD they are using is circular: ""Miners must mine at the blocksizes we say because otherwise miners would be free to mine at whatever blocksize they want. Miners must be scared of us users so that they will not deviate from what us users want."" See the problem? The premise is that miners have the freedom to obey or disobey Core, but the concern is that they will have the freedom to disobey Core. It's a self-defeating point, because if they can be scared into following the users, there is no need for a hardcoded blocksize cap at all as they will never mine or mine atop oversized blocks, and likewise the hardcoded cap in Core software must by that logic have no meaning anyway. Either miners want to please users or they don't. If they don't, there is no way to force them to run any particular software, and if they do there is no need to. But Core supporters never seem to think that carefully so as to see the internal contradictions pervading their worldview.

""Miners must stick to 1MB or else they'd be free to mine bigger blocks."" The self-contradictory implication is that miners must somehow self-bind by running Core so that, what, they cannot stop running Core? It is an argument that merely runs in circles and says nothing. **Either miners vote at every block or they don't.** Running Core@1MB is a vote that the current blocks should be no bigger than 1MB, but nothing about Core software magically prevents them from switching their vote at the very next block. Miners are always choosing the blocksize and it cannot but be so. The 1MB cap doesn't exist except as a Schelling point, helped by Core's hardcoding but only until the ecosystem matures more and brings more talent on, as it is doing now. What is there to think about a group aims to stay in power through clearly unsustainable tactics? Through believe that when Bitcoin was a tiny fringe phenomenon it somehow attracted all the most qualified coders and now when it is literally a million times bigger the gigantically bigger pool of talent to draw from cannot beat these guys? No, these are small fry who still have the mindset that they are the big fish in their little pond.

The logic is somewhat correct but I also belief the price and bitcoin as a brand is dependent on perception, not technology or performance. Security is what holds its price. The brand is now accepted by big corporations as well as individuals. Like Microsoft in the early days, if it gets the job done even if there were better products, it will have the masses follow. As a payment system it sucks and there are far superior products coming but can't be mentioned by name on this forum. eg. Dxxx. I think BTC will hold its trend and BCH will have its followers as well. The market will take a long time to determine who is to be as upgrades are not limited for neither.

I'd guess this puts the BTC chain's difficulty adjustment out at 2.5 weeks away. The rest comes down to how fast the BTC mempool floods. Also how the BCH price moves. If BTC's price goes down as it's network floods/slows the effect will compound.

"By that definition there is a fork happening every block as long as even one guy keeps changing his software.

The real issue is whether a fork is valued by enough investors (and therefore also by miners, and exchanges) to be of any economic significance. In this case, apparently no. So people won't be calling it a split, just an upgrade.

But it shouldn't escape notice that Core is doubly wrong here, because not only are they incorrect that controversial forks are dangerous, they also think such an economically significant surviving fork would be a disaster (and the really economically dim ones think it would create inflation or dilute stakeholder value).

"- maybe a **""mandatory upgrade""** is better terminology than ""hard fork"".  Any non-technical user would understand that.  Those that don't follow the mandatory upgrade would expect that their machines / software would now be dysfunctional.

- When a hard fork is done to intentionally branch the chain - eg when there are two or more different philosophical standpoints (or a bunch of a-holes like core) then the term could be that the block chain is undergoing a **""network split""** rather than a hard fork.

Here is an example of how it would be used in layman's terms:

""We were intending to do a **mandatory upgrade** to the bitcoin network to increase the block size to more than 1 mb due to increasing congestion but Core refused to allow this to happen so we decided to do a **network split** instead and create a new coin called Bitcoin Cash.  Anyone holding bitcoins before the split will have an equivalent number of Bitcoin Cash coins after the split.""

In my opinion, it depends on if BCH price can hold. If it does, enough miners will leave BTC and thus slow it down. I believe they have 3 weeks before their next DAA. If the network slows down too much, you will see capital leave BTC for BCH like we saw over the weekend (but in a more stable manner). The price of BCH is the key, without it being stable and/or increasing, there won't be enough of an incentive for enough miners to leave BTC. Miners need to leave BTC to slow it down and create the cascading affect of high fees + slow block times.;4;2;False;dnalioh;dprusal;Bitcoin Cash network upgrade is confirmed and live with the block #504031;7cq87y;https://blockchair.com/bitcoin-cash/block/504031
