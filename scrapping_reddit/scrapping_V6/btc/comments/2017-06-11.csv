"The early adopters of bitcoin took enormous risk on something 99% of people scoffed at. The reason they made so much money was because their investment was so unproven and had such little odds of being successful. It's like someone who puts money on the slowest horse in a horse race. They make the most money only because their odds were so small. I don't consider that unfair. Everyone else had a chance to invest in bitcoin in 2010 too. How many did? The early investors in bitcoin were risk takers, and played that crucial role in making bitcoin's value and recognition go up, which alowed it to become what it is today. They did so without any knowledge that it would pay off. It's like the early investors in Microsoft, when people didn't even know what computers were. Regarding the volatility of bitcoin, you have to realize that the reason it's so volatile is because it's still so young. If bitcoin were $100,000 per coin, it's value would not fluctuate 10% a day. As the total amount of money invested in it increases, the volatility will inversely and proportionally decrease. Indeed, this has already happened. From 2009 to 2013 the value of bitcoin went from thousandths of a dollar per coin, to over a thousand dollars per coin. From 2013 to June of 2017, the price has gone from about a $1000 to $3000 a coin, which is hundreds of times less volatile. Also, cryptocurrency is not a bubble. People said that about the internet, because it was new and no one understood it. There might be bubbles within the newly emerging market, like the dot com bubble of the internet, but the technology itself is revolutionary, and, mark my words, it is here to stay.

"Yes, which many have. The problem is you then need a majority of users to start using your software. And even then, if you have say 60% of users on board, your software will cause a split.

In that event, 60% of users will be on a separate chain that has large blocks, and 40% will be on the 1Mb limited chain.

This will cause the prices to go down, as suddenly there are essentially two separate Bitcoins. (""Bitcoin1Mb"" and ""BitcoinPlus""). Eventually one chain *might* die out. But In the case of Ethereum, an alternative coin, both chains have survived such an event.

To safely fork it and not cause a split, you need an overwhelming majority of users to be on your side (85-95%). This would ensure that the other chain (5-15%) will most likely die out very quickly, as users realize they must switch to the longer valid chain with a majority of users/miners. With only 5-15% of users/mining power, it would take a *very* long time to make even 1 block of transactions.

Edit: worth noting, there is actually a compromise in the works that would hopefully please both sides. It's Called ""Segwit2X"", as one side wants their Segwit technology used for scaling, and the other simply wants block size doubled. 

Someone released a Testnet client for it today (although I haven't had a chance to check it out or see if it's official yet). They just need to make sure there aren't any critical bugs, and release a Mainnet version. Once that happens, people can start running it, and showing their support.

"> Firstly, why would a group of computer scientists lie to the community,

They are not computer scientists they are developers, none have any experiences in business or economics, BS/Core have no scientists. (they are not demonstrating competence in rational analysts so I hesitate to call them scientists.) 

I think it is that they don't understand how bitcoin works from an economic incentive perspective, they are not incentive designers with a sound understanding in sociology. So they are either ignorant which occam's razor suggests or they are malicious which is also possible. 

It should be obvious to anyone that if you limit miners fees then the security will diminish as the security subsidy drops. If one expects fees to increase they will to a point but [theory of Substitute good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_good) tells us that people are going to use other networks (ETH comes to mind) users will leave bitcoin when we have to pay between $500 - $1000 per transaction for the same security we have now if the value stored on the network is 2 orders of magnitude higher. 

Like wise [monetarist theory dictates](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/05/010705.asp) in the flowing equation (MV=PT) that if the quantity of money is fixed and the transaction capacity is also fixed then for the value of money to increase the transaction value must increase. 

most people yet to adopt bitcoin can't afford to do $10,000 transactions because they don't have the capital. 

there is also the problem of UTXO bloat already over half the outputs are undependable because there is a $5 minimum fee. it will be greater as the value of bitcoin grows, segwit increases UTXO bloat the opposite of what is claimed. its only a relative decrease but not a quantitative one - eg. BU would give a greater incentive to combine outputs to reduce the UTXO set than segwit as proposed. 

I don't have much say in that rules miners enforce, but if they have any economic insight they would insist on removing the limit before securing layer 2 networks that facilitate transactions that don't pay them fees. Segwit is designed to get miners to secure layer 2 networks have transactions that don't pay mining fees.

In consumer theory, substitute goods or substitutes are products that a consumer perceives as similar or comparable, so that having more of one product makes them desire less of the other product. Formally, X and Y are substitutes if, when the price of X rises, the demand for Y rises.

Potatoes from different farms are an example: if the price of one farm's potatoes goes up, then it can be presumed that fewer people will buy potatoes from that farm and source them from another farm instead.

There are different degrees of substitutability. For example, a car and a bicycle may substitute to some extent: if the price of motor fuel increases considerably, one may expect that some people will switch to bicycles.

"It has increased for a very specific reason. A company funded by one of the biggest financial corporations in the world has decided to try to leech off Bitcoin by keeping its transaction rate limited to a mere 3 transactions per second, so that people will be forced to use their company's ""second layer"" products. 

They have bought up many of the key developers in the Bitcoin Core team and pushed others out with a relentless, three-year FUD and propaganda campaign supported by perhaps the most mindfuckingly extreme censorship and debate manipulation in the history of the Internet on the subreddit /r/Bitcoin.

Fortunately, the miners - the entities who actually vote on the system rules, including transaction capacit - are finally kicking Core to the curb.

"This is actually a common misconception. You're most definitely paying a credit card fee; it's just that it's hidden from you, bundled in the final price of the item you buy. 

Say you walk into a supermarket, fill your basket, and check out with $100 of groceries. You pay using your Visa card, and $100 eventually shows up on your credit card bill. Behind the scenes, the merchant gets charged a transaction fee (I've most frequently seen quotes around 2.9% plus 30c per transaction). This means the merchant gets charged $3.20, and your $100 purchase only nets them $96.80 in revenue. That $3.20 in fees is then split up between Visa, your bank, the supermarket's bank, and the payment processing company; that's how they make their profit.

Merchants know that their customers are more likely to use credit cards, so they increase their prices by a few percent to cover that charge. You still pay for the privilege of using a card - it's just baked into the sticker price. And if a customer should choose to pay cash, well, that's extra profit for the merchant!

This fee is also the reason why some mom & pop stores have signs that you can only use a credit card for purchases over $5 or whatever.  If you buy a candy bar for $1 and charge it to your card, the merchant will pay maybe $0.33 in transaction fees, netting them $0.67 on the sale. Let's say the merchant paid $0.75 for that candy bar. They actually *lose* money when you make that purchase on a card! Officially, payment processing agreements prohibit the merchant from setting a minimum to use their card, but it's still a common practice.";5;1;False;ClassicClassicist;diquh11;"Average Bitcoin transaction fee is now above five dollars. 80% of the world population lives on less than $10 a day.

"I don't diagree with you, but you should acknowledge the downsides of increasing the blocksize too. A bigger block size results in a block chain that grows faster. In the not-too-far-away future, the blockchain will be too big for ""regular"" people to host. This leads to a more centralized network, which means a few people with huge amounts of processing power will control most of the network. The fewer people who are significantly contributing to the network means fewer people need to cooperate to perform succesfull attacks on the network. Of course this problem will still exist without a blocksize increase, so we might as well increase the blocksize to make bitcoin more usable now. Although that means we need to come up with a more permanent solution sooner, or move on to another technology than bitcoin when we get to the point where we are seing attacks on the network.

ASICBoost is a mining optimization, it actually makes the network more secure. The problem is that it is patented, by different teams, in different countries (USA, China).

The advantage it gives is about 1-2%, so miners are not actually using it. It is more profitable to find cheaper electricity.

"Bitcoin can scale, what you are saying is there is a limit to the transaction capacity and that is true. 

the Lightening Network can compete with Visa and PayPal. 

the difference in opinion is: do we need to artificially limit bitcoin to 1MB to make layer 2 solutions viable or can we use the natural technological limit that is inherent to the network. 

The intrinsic bitcoin limit has an economic incentive that ensures miners limit transactions and block size before we approach it. Its the free market at work.

large block proponents advocate for decentralized market forces.

"This is a complete misunderstanding of how Bitcoin works. Hosting the blockchain gives you precisely zero control over the network. Mining is the only way to affect the network.

Besides, even if your goal is to have more people hosting the blockchain, increasing the blocksize to allow for more transactions at cheaper rates should be your top priority. A more popular network is going to attract far more interest than an ultra-high-fees, 3-transactions-per-second curiosity.
