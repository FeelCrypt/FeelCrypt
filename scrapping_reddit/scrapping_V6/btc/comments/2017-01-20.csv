"No one will. It's only a threat that Core fundamentalists make.

here is how it works according to the designer Shatoshi - he states in the Bitcoin white paper:

>Nodes always consider the longest chain to be the correct one and will keep working on
extending it. If two nodes broadcast different versions of the next block simultaneously, some
nodes may receive one or the other first. In that case, they work on the first one they received,
but save the other branch in case it becomes longer. The tie will be broken when the next proofof-work
is found and one branch becomes longer; the nodes that were working on the other
branch will then switch to the longer one.

So those calling a fork or BU an altcoin or extending an orphan chain don't actually understand how bitcoin works. 

When BU gets more than an average of 50.01% hashpower, and can sustain it, miners can safely move the block limit. BU is one safe way of doing it as described in the White Paper. https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf. 

save a copy because the Core Fundamentalists are wanting to change Satoshi's White Paper to reflect the changes they are making.

"Some people have stated they would dig their heels in and support a minority chain purely on idealogical grounds. This says to me that the incentive structure of Bitcoin is broken.

The key thing though is that the incentive structure is heavily geared towards miners, not node operators. As long as all the major miners work on the same chain I can't see a minority chain getting any traction. Sure the idealogical node operators would stay connected to it, but there would not be enough hash rate to build on it - they would be forced to perform a hard fork to reset the difficulty. Doing so would only make the minority chain more obscure and insignificant.

That's my theory anyway.";1;0;False;Matthew-Davey;dco00b8;"Charlie Shrem on Twitter: ""If we don't implement bigger blocks ASAP, Paypal will be cheaper than #bitcoin. I already pay a few dollars per tx. Stop hindering growth.""";5ozdmw;https://twitter.com/CharlieShrem/status/822189031954022401
"> I agree that the priority is censorship resistance. That is why I am against Lightning Network. LN in order to be efficient, centralizes Bitcoin into big payment hubs.

Lighting is a layer 2 on top of Bitcoin.  It shouldn't impact the resistance of the underlying layer much.  I agree that Lightning may have centralized hubs, but that doesn't really bother me, many people used centralized Bitcoin banks now, having these as lighting hubs is far better than these banks which can steal or lose user funds.

> On the other hand, incresing the block size to 2 Mb does not centralize Bitcoin because CPU power, internet bandwith and data storage are more than 2 times bigger than 8 years ago.

I agree that 2MB would be great.  It is therefore very lucky that pretty much everyone is happy increasing the blocksize to 2MB then, otherwise it would be very difficult to do and may not have happened.  It is also great the Core team has found a way of doing this that is very fast, such that we do not even wait for other users to upgrade before enjoying the benefits of twice the scale, but still using the same chain and being fully compatible with these non upgraded users.

The other great thing about the SegWit 2.1MB onchain scaling proposal, is it also solves the quadratic hashing problem, this means we can then increase the blocksize even further after SegWit has activated, without increasing the risk of very hard to validate blocks that much

"> why LN then?

Why LN what?  Why is LN a good idea?  

I think LN is good because it can allow very fast settlement of payments, e.g. microseconds rather than hours Bitcoin's main consensus mechanism can take.  The other main advantage is that capacity can be much greater, this is because in LN, transaction data only needs to be exchanged between a few parties who are directly involved in the transaction, with Bitcoin's blockchain only used if things go wrong as a fail-safe.  In contrast, with Bitcoin's base layer, the data needs to be broadcast to, downloaded by, verified and stored by all participants in the system, this has inherent disadvantages when it comes to capacity. (Although despite these weaknesses, luckily pretty much everyone agrees with you and I that we can and should at least double the current 1MB limit, I wish it was done sooner, but luckily it looks like it might happen soon)

So I think LN is considered a win win type of solution.  One can use the bitcoin token for instant payments with high capacity, but we don't compromise the censorship resistance on the underlying Bitcoin layer itself.";-1;1;False;jonny1000;dcnvjgy;"Charlie Shrem on Twitter: ""If we don't implement bigger blocks ASAP, Paypal will be cheaper than #bitcoin.

Absolutely.  If the community is divided, the approval rate can oscillate between 49.9% and 50.1%.  It's very bad to make irreversible decisions based on that.

There are traditionally two ways to deal with this; one is to require i.e. 66% or 75% majority for doing significant changes, the other is to require a steady majority; i.e. that a proposal has more than 50% support for more than a year.  Both approaches will work out, but a threshold bigger than 75%  for introducing changes can easily mean that changes won't happen.

Segwit is both effectively AND literally, a blocksize increase.  It doesnt matter if somebody says it is or is not a blocksize increase.  SegWit is factually a blocksize increase.

> Bitcoin Unlimited solves this problem for good

Bitcoin Unlimited is a divergent and flawed system.  BU opens up new devastating attack vectors and abandons the fundamental convergence Bitcoin has which makes it work.  Nor does it help with the inherent scaling issues, that users need to download, propagate, verify and store all the transaction data.

> No need for LN

If people want to use LN they can, if they don't they won't.  I dont see why BU impacts that.

> those problems are solved with Bitcoin Unlimited too in a clean elegant way as a hard fork

"I was thinking a bit about this, and came to think that the US election system may be to blame.

Say there are three candidates wanting to be president, A, B and C - where A is the most popular and C is the least popular - and most of those preferring C to become the president would prefer B over A.

Since the president is elected on a simple majority, it doesn't make sense at all voting for C - any C-supporters should forget about C and vote for B instead.

So we've come down to that it doesn't matter which candidate you would *like* to become a president.  What really matters is which candidate you *would not like* to become the president.  If you would not like A to become the president, you need to vote for B, even if you think C would be a great president.

This again means that successful campaigning for A and B will not be so much about promoting the ideas of A and B, but rather about smearing B and A with dirt.

Rinse and repeat through multiple president elections, and for each election the campaigning and peoples mentality will be just more and more cynic.";2;0;False;tobixen;dcnsysq;"Charlie Shrem on Twitter: ""If we don't implement bigger blocks ASAP, Paypal will be cheaper than #bitcoin.

"bitcoin transactions increase exponentially as more users adopt bitcoin. more users that adopt bitcoin the higher the price of bitcoin.  

This is an argued problem because we have technological constraints and if we allow bitcoin to grow it will fall under control of huge data centers resulting in centralized control. There are lots more arguments and counter arguments (creative people have been inventing arguments for the last 5 years - we are at a stale mate.)  small block proponents want to change the bitcoin protocol to grow demand using other networks that are not bitcoin like the Lightening Network. Large block proponents what to allow bitcoin to grow organically. 

Satoshi introduced a soft fork limit of 1MB, small block proponents argue that removing the 1MB limit is a change because it requires a coordinated network upgrade known as a hard fork. Small block proponents say we don't need a hard fork change we can introduce a soft fork change (segwit) that allows bitcoin to scale with 3rd party solutions like the Lightening network and no coordinated network upgrade is needed as coordinated network upgrade are dangerous.   

For the longest time I felt Satoshi the inventor of bitcoin was wrong when he said: [By Moore's Law, we can expect hardware speed to be 10 times faster in 5 years and 100 times faster in 10. Even if Bitcoin grows at crazy adoption rates, I think computer speeds will stay ahead of the number of transactions.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3z0xod/satoshi_by_moores_law_we_can_expect_hardware/)

turns out transaction growth rate has been amazing however technology is improving faster as we can see: [Seagate's 60TB SSD comes a year after Samsung's 15TB SSD.](http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/08/seagate-unveils-60tb-ssd-the-worlds-largest-hard-drive/) and [1.4 Tbps with commercial-grade hardware.](http://gizmodo.com/the-fastest-real-world-internet-is-1000x-quicker-than-g-1506564949)

so with today technology we wouldn't need to upgrade for the next 10 years if we had 100MB blocks (currently limited to 1MB) it would be decades before we'd see dedicated computer room - let alone a data center.  (technological constants aren't going to force centralized control any time soon) 

when we look at [this chart](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/21mw7b/bitcoin_vs_metcalfes_law/) we see that the number of transactions is closely correlated with price.

when we look at [this chart](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3x8ba9/bitcoins_metcalfes_law_relationship_between/) - when full blocks start the correlation breaks down. 

[here is another graph showing exponential block size predictions](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3ame17/a_payment_network_for_planet_earth_visualizing/) 

bitcoin developers who are small block proponents are mostly employed by Blockstream the majority of their funding is from the second largest transnational corporation on the planet AXA. They pay most of the lead developers of Bitcoin Core, developers who disagree with them have been forced out of the team or left in frustration claiming bitcoin is doomed. Bitcoin is for all practical purposes under their centralized control. 

Criticism of this centralized control is not tolerated on the majority of the bitcoin communication platforms, r/btc being one place where freedom of speech is allowed however it comes at the cost of excessive trolling.

In short Gavin Andresen the second to Satoshi - [one kicked out of Core released this Fun fact](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5nefwf/gavin_andresen_on_twitter_fun_fact/)  it is funny because most web paged are bigger than the 1MB block limit and the miners who say blocks can't be bigger than 1MB have home pages bigger than 1MB, their argument to keep the block size below 1 MB being home users wont be able to download anything bigger than 1MB every 10 minutes and will force centralization - and those miners who say let more users use the blockchain and lets move the limit are more efficient with there data usage:

>the second post mocking Roger after being banned. I realize I'm stooping to the level of discussing events but the hypocrisy is so blatant - and the depressing thing is it's celebrated while more rational voices are banned from posting over there. 
 
There's no such thing as ""great minds discuss ideas, average minds discuss events and small minds discuss people"" as the link you provided claims. Even great philosophers eat, pee and poop just like everyone else. Everyone except maybe Our Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un who is so holy that he does not even have a butt hole (source: https://youtu.be/yzt0IACxlFA).

So for everyone except Kim, it's perfectly fine to discuss ideas, events *and* people. The alternative would be absurd, because try to imagine a world without anyone ever discussing any events or any person, just ideas. It wouldn't work. Who would you vote for becoming president for example if discussing people is beneath your great mind? You wouldn't be able to choose a candidate on your ballot because you'd never have heard about the people called Bernie, Hillary or Donald.

I'd say that a well functioning ""great mind"" has to discuss *all* of those things. Ideas, events and people are all equally important topics to discuss.
