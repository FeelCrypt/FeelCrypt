">	Just having it classified as property from a tax perspective, makes it impossible for the average person to reasonably use crypto as an everyday spending/earning money...the tracking and reporting on basis and profit/loss for every transaction, is simply far too onerous.

The way I do it:

If I spend $400 worth of BCH, I spend and replace.

Usually by a bit more say $450.

So say today in the morning I sold $400 BCH and later the same I rebuy $450, I have made no profit from a sell but actually bought $50 worth of BCH that day therefore I declare buying $50 (and not sell $400 and rebought $450).

It is not an advice but that’s how I go about it.

It is actually true IMO, I cannot profit from a seller if I rebuy immediately my position therefore I shouldn’t be taxed on profit I didn’t make.

You still have to report buying $50..

"While I appreciate your insight I disagree. I think you are looking at this through the lens of a person born in the last few years, not a person who has studied civilisation and how changes have happened. Chaos is the *only* way this will play out. It is the only way it *ever* plays out. The Sumerians started civilisation (or were one of the first peoples) over 5,000 years ago. To this day whenever an kingdom or “state” changes from one form of governance to another it is through violence and chaos. Think about that. 5,000 years and we havent learned how to do it peacefully, because humans are flawed. And all our beauties and shortcomings come in the way of the “right way to do it” 
I want the state gone and I want it gone yesterday. Throughout civilisation there has been many events/wars/power grabs that have had very difficult patches after they happened. Violence ensued. People died. People starved. That would have been a ver shitty place to live and  lot of people die. But people moved on.
I know it will not be easy and people will suffer. I also never made an omelette without breaking eggs. This of course doesn’t mean I advocate violence. That would make me no different to a statist. But there will be violence and chaos. Or statism will never fall

>Organizing is important. Activism is important.


>At the same time, we should remember that governments don't often reform themselves. One of the arguments in a book I read recently (Bruce Schneier, ""Data and Goliath""), is that perfect enforcement of the law sounds like a good thing, but that may not always be the case. The end of crime sounds pretty compelling, right, so how can that be?

>Well, when we look back on history, the progress of Western civilization and human rights is actually founded on the violation of law. America was of course born out of a violent revolution that was an outrageous treason against the crown and established order of the day. History shows that the righting of historical wrongs is often born from acts of unrepentant criminality. Slavery. The protection of persecuted Jews.

>But even on less extremist topics, we can find similar examples. How about the prohibition of alcohol? Gay marriage? Marijuana?

>Where would we be today if the government, enjoying powers of perfect surveillance and enforcement, had -- entirely within the law -- rounded up, imprisoned, and shamed all of these lawbreakers?

>Ultimately, if people lose their willingness to recognize that there are times in our history when legality becomes distinct from morality, we aren't just ceding control of our rights to government, but our agency in determing thour futures.

>How does this relate to politics? Well, I suspect that governments today are more concerned with the loss of their ability to control and regulate the behavior of their citizens than they are with their citizens' discontent.

>**How do we make that work for us? We can devise means, through the application and sophistication of science, to remind governments that if they will not be responsible stewards of our rights, we the people will implement systems that provide for a means of not just enforcing our rights, but removing from governments the ability to interfere with those rights.
**


>You can see the beginnings of this dynamic today in the statements of government officials complaining about the adoption of encryption by major technology providers. **The idea here isn't to fling ourselves into anarchy and do away with government, but to remind the government that there must always be a balance of power between the governing and the governed**, and that as the progress of science increasingly empowers communities and individuals, there will be more and more areas of our lives where -- if government insists on behaving poorly and with a callous disregard for the citizen -- we can find ways to reduce or remove their powers on a new -- and permanent -- basis.

>Our rights are not granted by governments. They are inherent to our nature. But it's entirely the opposite for governments: their privileges are precisely equal to only those which we suffer them to enjoy.

>We haven't had to think about that much in the last few decades because quality of life has been increasing across almost all measures in a significant way, and that has led to a comfortable complacency. But here and there throughout history, we'll occasionally come across these periods where governments think more about what they ""can"" do rather than what they ""should"" do, and what is lawful will become increasingly distinct from what is moral.
