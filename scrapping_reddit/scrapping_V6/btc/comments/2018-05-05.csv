"Sure it is.  If we just don't take it as an insult but treat it as just the obvious way to shorten the name that it is then what does it matter how it started?

As someone else pointed out here people are probably going to shorten the name anyway because that's what people do and this is the obvious way to do that.  The general public will not know or care that was originally said as an insult.  

Why should I be offended by that anyway?  Oh no, they shorted the name of a coin I like, such outrage.  Who gives a crap.  We should just laugh at them for not being able to come up with a better insult and use it anyway.  Then what do they say?  They would have to come up with a new insult I guess.

"You have that all backwards I think.

BTC added contentiously: Replace By Fee, SegWit as a soft fork, and keeps a 1mb block size that was *never* supposed to remain, and *disabled* opcodes or crippled them.

BCH *removed:* Replace by Fee, removed SegWit \(or never had it depending on your perspective\), and in May is fully restoring the *original* 32mb maximum threshold it had on day one, and enabling and restoring the opcodes to BCH can be a platform again.

BTC is the one that drastically changed what it is, why should it keep the name? BCH is restoring the project back to the roots of the first version of it to follow the original whitepaper and roadmap that BTC abandoned.

"Yup. The problem with ""bitcoin cash is bitcoin"" is that unless you have the full context of Bitcoin's dirty history, this phrase sounds pretentious and confusing. It seems like something is indeed trying to ""steal"" the brand to an outsider. Its important to remember the whole world are not trolls, a lot of them are simply misinformed. This crede works between Cashers but not so well in the real world outside of us.

Like, I understand what that means in that Bitcoin Cash is the direct continuation of the original project because Ive been around Bitcoin intently for 5 years now, but 90&#37; of most coiners now don't understand or know that. Our first coin was BTC, their first coin was probably ETH or now even others like Nano. They don't give a shit and most will never look beyond surface trolling, and never will unless BCH offers them something they want.

It just isn't effective marketing to continue using such a phrase that way as a practical matter to improve PR a bit, though I fundamentally agree with it.

The best advertising for BCH is *build shit on it that is useful to people.* Make more [memo.cash](https://memo.cash)'s. we don't need a fancy ad campaign, just build something that fucking works and people want, and the users and adoption will come.

"Not entirely following the logic.    You admit the money part is important, thank heavens.    But, why hung up on Bitcoin, the name, the brand, being the most critical end goal.   Think about it, if Bitcoin Cash becomes more valuable, and is on its way to the original bitcoin chain dying off, haven't you already won?   You got the money part you first mentioned.   You succeeded in growing the value of the coin and users, without needing the sole Bitcoin.   

Unless the path to success does include some trickery in gaining adoption because it's a flavor of Bitcoin, which has some magic power.   It's a weird one to think about.   But no one right now cares to think about the dichotomy between the flavor name the the original name.      Also, if BCH ever does win and original btc dies off,  you still have the BCH ticker.

"You're wrong actually. Check out this article from Gavin: http://gavinandresen.ninja/are-bigger-blocks-better-for-bigger-miners

Big blocks are actually BAD for decentralization, and in a pretty dramatic way. The bigger the blocks, the more profitable the biggest mining pool becomes. So, joining a mining pool other than the largest one will actually mean losing money. Good luck convincing people to voluntarily give up profits. Gavin used two assumptions to come to the conclusion that big mining pools were up to .3% more profitable than individual miners/small mining pools: there was a cap on transaction size (There isn't in BCH) and 20mb blocks (BCH is 32mb and will eventually grow exponentially larger). So, that .3% is inevitably going to balloon up.

This is why Roger has argued in the past that decentralization is not a core tenet of BCH. He knows that BCH is going to be much more centralized than Bitcoin. This is always why I personally don't get why BCH supporters always try to compete with and slander Bitcoin - they're two completely different ideas at this point and aren't really competing.

"""bcash"" was started as a direct attack by trolls to rename the project from the first hour of the fork, even squatting the /bcash subreddit as a propaganda page. The entire industry aside a few backwater exchanges did not go along with it. 

By ""owning"" it you mean submitting to their campaign and letting them completely steal the Bitcoin name and deny Bitcoin Cash's heritage, and most of us completely disagree with that. 

""bcash"" might have organically taken hold as the shorthand had trolls not used it as a weapon against us first, so now we fight it.

"I really don't see any point in making a huge battle about it. 

My personal opinion is that the distinction between Bitcoin BTC and Bitcoin Cash BCH is both fine __and useful__ for now. Adopters need to know that the BTC fork isn't useful as cash and that if you are wanting to use the coin as Cash then you obviously pick the token called Bitcoin Cash for your transactions.

It's clear to me that in time BCH will assert its utility over BTC, and when the hashpower moves as a result, the ""name"" if necessary will be carried across once BCH has the greatest proof of work (i.e. people will naturally start referring to Bitcoin Cash as merely Bitcoin). When the greatest proof of work chain moves across BCH there could be no reasonable contention about the use of the name.

Long-term I also think that the store of value property is stronger in BCH than BTC owing to the medium of exchange utility of BCH - so I'm finding it hard to envisage a future for BTC that is anything more than it being a bit of a curiosity.

So, all in all, I'd much prefer to use patience rather than engage in pointless and divisive battles.

""Linux is the best-known and most-used open source operating system.""

im not sure what your experience is but after 6 years of higher ed in IT working and 16 years in industry i can tell you from my experience, there isnt even a debate.  yes, asking which flavor is common but linux is at its core.  the same way bitcoin is the core source code to any of its flavors. 

the source code page for bitcoin cash even states ""Bitcoin Cash is a descendant of Bitcoin. ""

it doesnt change the fact that, similarly to linux, there will be better versions.  much like bitcoin cash may end up being the better version of bitcoin in the long run.  but it will never change that bitcoin is bitcoin and bitcoin cash is bitcoin cash.

i support them both, *both bitcoin and bitcoin cash are great products* but the name really isnt in question (for now, or ever)
