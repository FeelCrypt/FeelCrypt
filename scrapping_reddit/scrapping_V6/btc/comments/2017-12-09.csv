That may not seem flashy, but after 10-20 years it will be a huge sum of cash.

A spark is enough to start a fire. If you do it persistently, there's only so many coins on exchanges. 1 billion to move above ATH is enough. That's roughly 70000 at current prices, there's around 1.5 million bitcoin on exchanges. So as you can see it's pretty easy.

"I think the point /u/peptocurrency is making is the follows: 

1. People have unique addresses they deposit to on Bittrex, nobody else has access to your deposit address (fact). 

2. Bitfinex moves USDT directly from their wallet through a couple address (say, 1AA6iP6hrZfYiacfzb3VS5JoyKeZZBEYRW) to Bittrex, the content of which makes up the overwhelming bulk of Bittrex ""known"" wallet at 1DUb2YYbQA1jjaNYzVXLZ7ZioEhLXtbUru after(fact). 

Hence even if you don't assume 1DUb2YYbQA1jjaNYzVXLZ7ZioEhLXtbUru to be under finex control, the bulk of its content comes from a a single ""deposit"" address which can only be finex's. There are no multiple independent arbiters. (implication)

Also: As I pointed out 1MZAayfFJ9Kki2csoYjFVRKHFFSkdoMLtX takes the bulk of ""recycling"" from _both_ Polo and Bittrex back to Bitfinex.

Thanks, insightful to hear different peoples perspectives. After reading up on the distributed ledger/tangle of IOTA I'm also starting to wonder if blockchain is inherently unsuited for quick and cheap currency transfers while maintaining the other core aspects of security and decentralisation. But IOTA seems very focused on IoT and not currency and so maybe the search goes on, or back to some Bitcoin version. Or maybe the technological innovation is accelerating too quickly for us to timely adopt a promising ICO without the immediate backing of some giant. Which might be a terrible waste of a once in a human species oppurtunity.

"None of these are conspiracy theories. How is the fact that an exchange can create a currency, create as much of it as it likes without any sort of backing, and claim it equal to the dollar? 

There's no answer to where this money came from. If I was a bank or some sort of stock exchange, and you either wanted a bank certificate saying you have $100 of balance, or a stock that says you own 100 shares of a company, *they're backed by money or an actual company*.

What is Tether supposed to be? A 1:1 to the USD. So if it's equal to one dollar, *it needs to have a dollar in backing for every Tether*. OP is pointing out they Bitfenix owns all the Tether and seems to be ""printing"" more without having it backed with anything, and they also happen to own most of their currency that has no proof of value.

Around may of this year the market cap of all crypto combined was about 25 billion dollars. Then in just 8 months it went to over 400 billion dollars. That is times 16! Has user adoption of crypto grown 16 fold in 8 months time? No it has not, in fact adoption has gone down especially when it comes to Bitcoin. So what is going on? Well just think about it: Fiat banks can kill any crypto exchange by freezing bank accounts. So there are two routes to go --> 

- to legalize crypto and give it it's space within fiat banking so crypto will be traded on regular exchanges or crypto exchanges will become way more regulated then they are.

- for crypto exchanges to go even more unregulated and try all kinds of tricks to bypass the bullying banks.

But .... for any fiat to go back to people holding crypto, there is no escaping banks! 

If you check out all these subreddits /r/bitfinex /r/kraken /r/coinbase /r/bittrex 

you will find something that has been like it is even in the times of MtGox. It's very hard getting fiat money on a exchange by bank wire and it's even harder getting money back. There are tones of places on the internet where you can instantly buy bitcoin paying with your credit card  but to even get half a bitcoin worth of fiat on your bank account can take weeks. 

And so we have this super big crytpo exchange that supposedly is worth 400 billion dollars! But how much of that can flow in and out the system in fiat? Let's say somebody wants to sell 10 million dollars worth of crypto and get fiat for it, is that even possible going through exchanges instead of finding a buyer and doing everything directly one on one?  So what is that 400 billion dollars worth?

What is up with all the korean exchanges that within a year when from hardly any volume in Bitcoin to half of all the volume? 

How much wash trading is going on? If I constantly buy and sell my own crypto all day long I can generate an enormous amount of daily volume and if then crypto prices go up and I use the market prices to calculate all the USD that you would get for that crypto the end result is a very high daily volume. But since it's so hard for a regular person to get fiat in and out of the system all this volume is just crypto to crypto and does not mean much.

And what is up with when Bitcoin goes up, most other popular crypto go up to? That correlation is insane.It's like there is only one crypto.


No, I don't know when but I am confident a second MtGox is in the make. I am not saying these exchanges are a scam but it's just not that simple. Crypto is still borderline illegal. Governments and banks don't have a unified policy towards it. Banks can at any time freeze accounts that are affiliated  with exchanges and use the ""money laundering"" excuse, even if the exchange starts a law suit and wins it, who knows how long funds are frozen ... and then if the price goes down customers of that exchange are fucked because they can't sell.  

If crypto wants to survive it needs an internal market. it's own economy where people buy and sell good in crypto and get payed in crypto and pay their internet service provider in crypto.

For that it needs price stability and user adoption. If it does not get that, then crypto will stay 95% oh look this is very valuable, look at how fast it's getting more valuable! 

So even without all the Tethery stuff you can see there is a price bubble that does not live in reality where things are valued based upon more then just how fast they increase in value. It's the dotcom bubble all over again at hyperspeed but with 99% online. And this time any criminal that plays it right can get away with a small fortune in crypto without anybody even knowing their name ... even if crypto tanks 80% in price the next year .. just be patient. Some crypto will have some value for at the least the next 5 - 10 years and probably even long after that.  

This is a disaster in the make and some many people will loose money. I believe in crypto as a valid tool to give people more independence and to make payments on the internet better and faster and to make people less dependent on banks but this is not the way to do it. The way to do it is to go political and start slowly integrating the concept of crypto in to society. Don't fight the banks and government. First cooperate.

">You know what Bitcoin holders say when I bring this up? Meh, 800 million is only 0,5 % of 200 Billion dollars that is being traded so nothing bad will happen. Around may of this year the market cap of all crypto combined was about 25 billion dollars. Then in just 8 months it went to over 400 billion dollars. That is times 16! Has user adoption of crypto grown 16 fold in 8 months time? Now it has not, in fact adoption has gone down especially when it comes to Bitcoin. So what is going on?

"Well, go collapse it then. If tether is all a sham then it won't be able to sustain it's peg at one of the only exchanges that actually offers a direct $ rate. Let's do this sooner rather than later.

"No, that's not what I'm saying. I've made it clear so many times what I'm saying, both in these comments and in the post itself:

The conclusion of this post is that Tether/Bitfinex (they're one in the same) control 3/4 of USDT in existence across 3 separate exchanges, and that the BTC/USDT pair makes up almost 1/5 of BTC's 24hr trading volume. Make of that what you will, but the most concerning thing is that Tether is worthless, it's not even money and it's being created with zero proof of the existence of the required reserves. This is Federal Reserve level power. The power to create money backed by nothing. In the hands of a private company, who hoards 3/4 of it for themselves and uses it to profit across 3 exchanges.  

&nbsp;

>Bitfinex would send them specifically because, as you said, they are basically Tether. Why is that weird?

That's not what I said was weird. You're directly acknowledging that Bitfinex does indeed own all these accounts, so I can see that you do agree they control 3/4 of the Tether in existence.

"Long and complicated post and while I’m sure it’s all factual, the main thing that stood out for me was the intent to “outline who owns the majority of Tether, where it’s located and how much of BTCs trading volume it makes up”

So this is going to sound really simplistic (so apologies up front if I’ve missed something obvious) now as I can say I’m not really across it, but still want to put the question out there:

Q: Could the half a billion Tethers equate to some proportion of Bitfinex’s profits?

I’m not saying what’s wrong or right but just testing whether there is a case where the 1:1 pegging may hold. 

And if so then there shouldn’t be a problem with it being used in trading right? (Certainly not withstanding the “trust” matter where Tether can be printed way beyond the 1:1 of course)

- imo, it should be expected that exchanges hold most of the Tether. Nobody really holds Tether in their accounts, right?

If I had unregulated means - with no legal oversight - to create tokens that could be in turn directly exchanged for BTC [and other crypto], I would pump the market while selling older purchases to rake in the profits. Near zero investment or risk, with only gains to see. Exiting could be as easy as OTC BTC for $USD transactions, big off-market purchases made by those wanting in are great. Technically, the momentum the movement created would create could artificially increase organic volume and new money flowing in, which would act as a stabilizer or safety net.

All of this fits in line with the Bitfinex/Blockstrea/Tether/DCG circle of basically turning Bitcoin into fiat 2.0, effectively replacing central banks like the Federal Reserve as the central issuer of currency, forcing everyone to use their wares. Bitfinex is their market warfare arm.

It may be tin-foily, but banker conspiracies absolutely do exist and are very real.

">Think about these points. The only one who can be in control of this unknown address is Bitfinex. Here's why: 1) Bitfinex does not offer or trade USDT. Tell me what random soul out there is privately selling hundreds of millions of USDT worth of goods or services directly to Bitfinex, only to send their USDT revenue to Bittrex? Who in their right mind would sell anything in exchange for Tether? 2) It’s not Bittrex, because they would have received it from the Treasury if they had directly bought it from Tether for use in their trading pairs, the only place besides an exchange where you can get it. But besides offering it as a trading pair, what exchange would ever directly trade hard cash for a digital token whose terms of service explicitly outline its worthlessness?

I spend quite a bit of time following the addresses for my own trading purposes so hopefully I can clear up some of these points. The address that you identified as

Is clearly someone's deposit address on Bittrex. I know this because I've been watching it for months and have used its increasing amount of Tether deposits as a signal for when to long Bitcoin Cash, this trade has been very profitable for me. Its clearly controlled by someone very rich, but I don't think its necessarily controlled by Finex themselves. There are a lot of reasons why someone would want to sell any crypto for Tether. I don't consider it a red flag that someone would want to sell 100 BTC for tether and transfer it to Bittrex. In fact, I have reason to believe that this address is **Miner Controlled**. I would be happy to explain why, but I don't want to get too far away from the main point. Suffice it to say I believe your conclusion is incorrect. I think this address is a Miner controlled account on the Bittrex exchange which is why it never carries a balance for very long. Tether hits it solely for accounting purposes on Bittrex's side and then the money is moved into Bittrex's exchange wallet.

To address your point #2 all tether goes from Creation --> Treausry --> Bitfinex like you say. The treasury wallet never sends money anywhere else other than to Finex which is why I was aware of the ""hack"" 24 hours before it was announced publicly. To address your comment made in EDIT 1 it is my belief that both 31okFF1rUu8jjPEVuajycTRBp82Nteo4Mv and 16tg2RJuEPtZooy18Wxn2me2RhUdC94N7r belong to the ""hacker"".

>Poloniex-A sent a total of ~180 million USDT to Poloniex-B up to November 28th 2017. It's just sitting there, with the occasional return spend back to Poloniex-A (the one Bitfinex owns).

On we go, I'm sure you have noticed this but its clearly obvious that the addresses you are calling Poloniex A and Polinex B are simply Poloniex's hot and cold wallets. They even went through the small trouble of getting vanity addresses for them

> (Polo A) 1Po1oWkD2LmodfkBYiAktwh76vkF93LKnh --> 1Polo
>
> (Polo B) 1Co1dhYDeF76DQyEyj4B5JdXF9J7TtfWWE --> 1Co1d

Your question is easily answered by this, its just Polo sending money into their own cold storage.

To address this

>EDIT 2: Incidentally, the Treasury hasn't sent Tether since November 19th. Is there a new Treasury? All we have to do to figure that out is go to the Printing address. Sure enough, it has been sending hundreds of millions of Tether to this new address (1NTMakcgVwQpMdGxRQnFKyb3G1FAJysSfz) since November 26th. This is the only other address the printer has sent USDT to besides the original Treasury. The patterns yet remain the same. After hitting the Treasury, USDT flows straight to Bitfinex-A.

Yes they changed their procedures after the hack.

And addressing your final edit

>1MZAayfFJ9Kki2csoYjFVRKHFFSkdoMLtX is the ""recycling"" address that flows Poloniex USDT back to Bitfinex. 1MZAayfFJ9Kki2csoYjFVRKHFFSkdoMLtX doesn't just recycle Polo USDT, it also recycles Bittrex.

This is the only conclusion you have drawn about the owners of these wallets that I agree with. This is clearly a deposit address on Finex but this wallet does indeed seem to be owned by someone who's interests also align with Bitfinex.

Last point I will make is that I think you are attributing a lot of ""rinsing"" flushing"" or malicious activity to activity that really is just standard wallet activity. If you see a wallet that moves a lot of tether in one direction and usually carries a balance close to 0 that is most likely always someones deposit address on an exchange. It does look suspicious at first (it did to me) but really its just standard procedure.

"Hold on... for real? You can only withdraw Tether from Bitfinex? 

If you think this to the logical next steps. A lot of people think they are super rich, cash out at some point on Bitfinex and withdraw their Tether to exchanges like (for example) Kraken which allows FIAT withdraws & accepts Tether. How is kraken going to be able to handle all these withdraws that came from a currency with no prove of ""1$"" value?

All these exchanges will run dry on FIAT money and run into serious Banking problems. Unlike Mt. Gox this could result into a cascading effecting much more exchanges then just one which is the root of the scam.

How endlessly naive are people... This pyramid scam can just be held alive as long as there is more FIAT money flowing into these exchanges. Once we get into the ""Cash out"" period and people start taking profits out of the exchanges, the cascading could start.

"Let me help you out.  Tether got started as being connected to a bank in Taiwan.  Supposedly every digital tether they created was directly tied to that bank. In theory you could walk to that bank in Taiwan and give them a tether and they'd give you a US dollar.  Unfortunately that not how banking works.  Tether could probably give you small amounts of it's currency but if a big holder flew to Taiwan and asked for a million or billion dollars the bank would laugh and say who the fuck are you and what the fuck is a 'Tether'.  So people are trading between BTC and USD on these exchanges thinking they are safe when the reality is that the USD that are using is USDT which is backed up by absolutely nothing. 

Let's say you own a 100 bitcoins and you trade them all to tether to ride out a big dip in BTC.  If that exchange fails before you can buy BTC and put it in a cold wallet you are FUCKED out of 100 Bitcoins.

"Even what you quoted there does not 'come to a conclusion' in the sense that it does not explicitly explain why should I be concerned by that. The main problem is that you are not explaining your assumptions and you are not explaining why the connections you are drawing matter. This means that the only people who will find this persuasive are those who already believe those connections matter, i.e. those who are already persuaded.

Maybe I just piped up in the wrong thread. Maybe this information was intended for people who already know the score about Bitfinex/Tether and it was not intended to persuade any outside observer that anything bad or risky is going on. If so, I apologise. But if your intention is to persuade people who have never heard of the Bitfinex/tether connection that something risky is going on, then you need to follow up every connection or set of connections you draw with a direct explanation of why those connections *matter*. And then you need to repeat that explanation after drawing the next set of connections, and then again after the next set of connections, and so on. Repetition of the fundamental argument you are making is very effective to include after each new section of evidence. In this way, you can turn a bunch of impenetrable data into a persuasive argument that might actually work on people who were not already convinced that something shady is going on.

As it stands right now, I could not usefully present this information to anyone who did not already believe that tether is a scam. I appreciate that you put in a lot of effort though, and I don't mean to spit at that.

"**TL;DR** - Tether *(Tether Limited / Tether Holdings Limited)*, in partnership with Bitfinex *(BFXNA Inc. / iFinex Inc.)* is the sole user and trader of USDT across at least 3 major crypto exchanges (Bitfinex, Bittrex, Poloniex), controlling over 73% of USDT in circulation--623,000,000 of the total 844,000,000.

"I don't know why they ruled miners are not money transmitters, the answer is probably [here](https://coincenter.org/entry/aml-kyc-tokens), until I read that I would guess:

Miners don't act as a conduit for money, miners only testify to the order that existing transactions happened. The miner is not a participant in the transaction - see why FinCEN considered Mike Cadwell a money transmitter (in my link in previous comment) while ignoring others who used Bitcoin: he was accepting Bitcoin from one source and sending it to a second person who might potentially be different from the first source. Mike was effectively a conduit for money between the two people, which miners are not.

"LN will naturally form into a topology of massive centralised hubs, onto which you will open your payment channels, those hubs need to be licensed by FinCEN because an LN node is what the law calls a money transmitter*, which means the hubs will behave the same way as banks - wanting to know who their customers are and keeping an eye out for suspicious payments, placing embargos like Visa etc did with Wikileaks. You'll still be able to close a channel you have with a hub and recover the bitcoin, minus the enormous fees for that mainchain transactions are intended to have.

Basically LN is recreating the existing banking network.

The topology will favor massive central hubs because of the large parked capital requirements, the money transmitter license requirements, and (if I understand correctly, which I might not) LN's lack of ability to route well over long routes.

"There are ways I can imagine Lightning Network working out, for example non-profit hobby nodes that are not run as part of a business won't be considered money transmitters, so if enough individuals could open lots of payment channels on their nodes and if Lightning could route well over lots of lowly-interconnected nodes then it could work.

One of the things preventing people from opening lots of payment channels with friends etc (instead of just a couple on mega-hubs that do everything) will be the high Bitcoin fees for the main-chain. People are now talking about the need for a third scaling layer in the middle - in order to allow people to open and close channels with less cost, if they managed to pull that off then Lightning might decentralize to the point where regulation and censorship is pointless.

Though then you have a 3rd layer of complication, learning curve, and user-unfriendliness.

So it might work, and I don't have a crystal ball, but there's an awful lot of ""ifs"" to be betting the whole future of the coin on it, which is what the small-block approach is doing.";2;0;False;iwannabeacypherpunk;dqzojdk;Ladies and gentlemen, the future is here.

"> I don't have the balls to convert all my BTC to BCH now 

I understand you, and felt the same until this week. Holding equivalent nominal balances on both. But this doesn't make sense anymore.

Do you actually see BTC going that much far, the way it is? It doesn't work. I had to pay over 50$ in fees in total to pass a transaction with many inputs (not that many TBH, under 10) the other day. I had a friend calling me trying to help him out with his important transaction that wouldn't confirm, even though he had put ""high priority"" in his Ledger. This shit is broken, with no prospect of an acceptable fix. Oh, and historically there are always strong crashes after strong rises, like the one we've seen this year. Check how the mempool got these late days with the increase in price (fast moves in price generates more transactions). A fast decrease in price would be much worse since [transactions would be larger](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7gg2ph/why_you_wont_be_able_to_sell_your_segwitcoins/) and hashpower would go away. If we see a correction of the likes we've seen in 2013, congestion could be so epic it could effectively kill BTC.

Meanwhile BCH infrastructure is growing faster than any other coin. I expect Coinbase to open direct trading of it soon. Roger Ver was talking about a place to buy with credit card - tough, but if he pulls that out, the only thing we'd be missing are debit cards to spend - and TBH not even BTC is good on that front anymore, since Visa and Mastercard are basically blocking everyone living outside of the EU from having one of those cards.

I understand moving significant amounts of money is always delicate, but this week I converted a good chunk of my old BTC into BCH. I still own more BTC than BCH in market value, basically because its value is so much higher. But I'm already converting, slowly. I do intend to eventually own more BCH than BTC in market value.

"> For the future of BTC I actually think that BTC as a store of value only can work. It works for gold, don't see why it wouldn't for BTC.

Gold is not only a store of value. Actually, according to the World Gold Council, last year more than half of gold produced from mining or recycling went to jewelry alone, and around 7,6% of it into ""technological uses"". Investments plus central banks got around 40% of that, which is a large chunk I agree, but much smaller than the current chunk of BTC being sold to people who don't even care if it has a commercial use.

But regardless. The situation with BTC is dangerous. A severe movement of the price on a downward direction could bring an irrecoverable congestion. The only defense against that would be to have everyone onboard of their banking, I mean, lightning network before such movement happens.

I sympathize with the ""maximalist"" idea, but, on the real long run, why BCH and not ETH? Ether does seem technically superior. If they manage to get rid of mining for PoS and that works, it will make them considerably superior - specially if they drop inflation after that, as I heard was the plan.

I only changed my buying habits and started buying small amounts of ETH with the part of the money I save each month. In addition I've only went through the motions to setup a Coinbase account (and it was painful with the document scans and the requirements for 3D secure card) and they don't sell BCH directly I have to go through shapeshift which means additional taxes (I still did this to buy a small amount of Dash and EOS since I already own BCH)

We create our own coin and all of a sudden we hijack the name (uhhh, you gave them the right to the name considering they didn't create BTC or it's tech) they've now turned it to Segwit coin, which is completely different than the original WP, and yet they still think they own the name.

I love how they think this is a dictatorship, like no dude. Economics either work or they don't, once people realize they can't spend their store of value or digital gold anywhere.... why bother even own it? The answer is because it's unregulated, which will change IF LN is released, which I still suspect it never will be. They basically admitted it's in prealpha like a week ago. That's pathetic, if anything will save the original BTC, it's clearing the mempool and reducing fees, but they won't, they've proven it time and time again.

My favorite (YES FAVORITE PART OF THE DAY) is checking my investment daily for it to finally take over. I seem to remember this giddy feeling, and I'm not scared AT ALL of dropping from $1400 to $1175 Because I haven't had faith in BTC for a long time but I do have faith in BCH, as a superior method to replace worthless paper USD. Why would I ever need a store of value when I can't use it, where does it get it's value then?, that's like..... owning gold if it was unregulated. Go ahead and try to pay for gas with a chunk of gold. Whereas go ahead and pay for gas with BCH, one seems way more practical.....";11;2;False;mittremblay;dr0io7x;"Roger Ver on Twitter: ""Erik, the Bitcoin that you and I fell in love with in 2011, the one offering instant and basically free transactions for all of human kind along with a community that actually supports free speech is alive and well in the form of #BitcoinCash.

"I stopped using shapeshift because of their policy to still stick to BTC as a 'middle man' when shifting funds from one coin to another. The fees just made me vomit. 60$ for switching from litecoin to dash for example, and it still took half an hour to be processed.

As soon as Shapeshift uses BCH as the 'middle man', I'll be back in instantly.";6;3;False;grmpfpff;dr03kmi;"Roger Ver on Twitter: ""Erik, the Bitcoin that you and I fell in love with in 2011, the one offering instant and basically free transactions for all of human kind along with a community that actually supports free speech is alive and well in the form of #BitcoinCash.

"Interestingly I have both observed and participated in actual technical scaling debate. I have never ever seen the big blocker side lose the technical argument including when I myself argued with people that obviously read more about the issue (I had to keep reading their links while arguing). In the end the small blockers always declare ""but this is not a technical debate anyway"". Fuck them! If it is not technical debate then admit that technically big blocks are fine.

"I'm not getting into a long debate with you. I will say though, this argument that BCH is this widely accepted currency by merchants is just absurb. Last 24 hours, BCH's # of unique transactions is ~24k, LTC's is ~76k, Bitcoin is ~400k, Ethereum is ~760k. Hell, even Eth Classic has done ~49k unique transactions. BCH has close to the same number of unique transactions as Dogecoin's ~20k. And you can't just throw out ""name ten alts than x"" because my point is at least one alt does everything you listed better, which severely diminishes BCH's potential impact.";1;1;False;chazley;dqzkh57;Vinny:”Just remember, the people buying Bitcoin today don’t love it for the technology, they love it for the promises of the riches it will bring.

I'm suggesting that bitcoin isn't only a currency, whereas BCH has pigeonholed itself to only be superior to bitcoin as a currency. Every other alt in the world has noticed this,  its not like BCH has stumpbled upon some huge secret.

"Every point you just raised I could easily come up with a non-bitcoin alt (let alone bitcoin) that does those things better than BCH. Not a great response.

Just a quick aside: BCH's ""market cap"" is bullshit, and if you take that seriously you can't be considered a educated person in this debate.
