You're right, the wording might not be the best in that one sentence. But I'm not sure what better word to use. Bitcoin isn't an industry or a company. Maybe community would be a better word? Though $12bn community doesn't sound great.;1;1;False;CJYP;daf8x7q;With the public spotlight on Reddit censorship, now would be the perfect time to let the rest of Reddit know about the censorship on /r/bitcoin;5eqvhs;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5eqvhs/with_the_public_spotlight_on_reddit_censorship/
"I'm no expert on determining valuations for entire industries, but ""$12 billion industry"" may not be quite as inaccurate as you might initially think.

As a complex system with many different components, bitcoin is many things, depending on which part of the system you care about: it's a protocol, a currency, and a computer network. (This is similar to the internet itself, with its communications protocol, email as a container for transferring information, and its network of servers.)

In many ways, bitcoin actually does resemble a traditional industry.

* There are large data centers, called mining farms, that in a sense provide a secure space in a global ledger in which transactions can be recorded. These are analogous to factories producing a good.

* There are teams of software engineers who create competing versions of software that can be used by the data centers. These are analogous to engineers who design production processes.

* There is a protocol that provides a unifying standard to allow for the interoperability of the different parts. This is analogous to guidelines that allow manufactured goods to be built from parts sourced from a variety of vendors.

* There is a network of computers that broadcast copies of the ledger around the world. These are analogous to the trucks, trains, planes, and ships that transport goods to consumers.

* There are independent organizations that create digital wallets, allowing consumers and businesses to access and store bitcoin. These might be analogous to stores, except that each person can have their own store (or they can use a traditional store).

* There are exchanges that make it easy to buy and sell units of the currency...

These analogies are probably imperfect, but it seems reasonable to consider bitcoin an industry. 

Determining how to value the industry is another matter, of course. The different companies that make the system work (exchanges, miners, custodial wallet providers, ...) each generate their own revenue streams, which might provide one way of valuing this industry. Assigning an actual value, however, requires a lot of speculation (companies' financial details aren't always available, and when making projections, we don't know if current trends will continue.)

Fortunately, there is a sophisticated market that works 24/7 to turn all of these speculations into a single aggregate value, namely, the bitcoin market itself. The price of a bitcoin encapsulates speculators' best guesses as to the value of the whole system. If no one finds bitcoin useful, the value will go to zero. If it is tremendously useful, the value will be very high, due largely to the fact that the supply of bitcoin is limited (roughly 16 million bitcoin have been produced so far, and the total number will never exceed 21 million). 

In this sense, the bitcoin market cap might actually be considered as a simple proxy for a more direct valuation scheme. In fact, a publicly traded company can be valued in much the same way: it's total value can be defined to be its market cap, which is the price per share multiplied by the number of outstanding shares. The bitcoin market cap provides a similar measure that in some sense accounts for the success of all bitcoin-related companies.

Note 1: I think the claim that r/bitcoin censorship is ""destroying a $12 billion industry"" may still be a little bit misleading. The censorship in r/bitcoin is blatant and damaging, so it is an important contributing factor to the current stalemate in the scaling debate, but it may not be the most important factor. As others have pointed out, the majority of the global hashpower (i.e. most of the mining) is in China right now, and other discussion forums are more popular there.

Note 2: Corrections or feedback on this analysis would be great!

Now, as far as shadow-deleting of comments, this is the right of the mods of a subreddit. Otherwise, that option would not be provided by Reddit. For instance, death threats are often shadow-deleted, or manually deleted by mods.

Even r/btc does shadow-deleting, though. So again, in the interest of speaking fairly about ""r/bitcoin heavy censorship"", why not mention in the same breath that r/btc also engages in this?

Because what you are saying is conjecture while your rhetoric is harsh and decisive. A common red flag.

The actual transaction history of Bitcoin shows that it grew steadily as opposed to hitting the maximum ASAP as your hypothesis suggests. It doesn't even correlate well with historical soft limits, which by itself would be evidence of some governance other than hard limit anyway.

So, no historical evidence, no definition of decentralization and not even any proposed metrics. Granted, XT lacked in these aspects as well, but at least they dared to begin doing some threat modeling.

Without being equipped with these, you would obviously have to resort to political battle, which you did. I'm sure there were some voting games involved at the time, but your bleak picture of unscrupulous adversaries is most certainly psychological projection.

I am pretty convinced that Bitcoin blockchain should remain as small as possible, but all in all I think your mentality is the biggest threat against ""decentralized and free"" Bitcoin at the moment. Certainly much more dangerous than big blocks.

"> The price reaction bit is hilariously silly. To say the price did anything for any reason is pure speculation. And if we take that point to its logical conclusion then the price rise was higher before blocks were full. So the price supports not full blocks more than full blocks.

This is probably better explained by bitcoin's wide media coverage and general bubbleness. There were only 2 weeks when the price was higher than it is today, and it is much less volatile today.

They probably mean the market cap of bitcoin, calculated as value-per-bitcoin * number-of-bitcoins, which works out to just under $12bn. There's VC-investment and already-running business which were not included and would probably make true figure of the bitcoin economy size quite different.

"Bitcoin has been largely hijacked by a company called Blockstream whose mission requires that Bitcoin not be able to upgrade natively. Blockstream has accomplished this hijacking very simply by hiring many the key developers and repurposing them.  Blockstream's stated motive is to sell consulting services for ""sidechains"" which can be thought of as ways to work around Bitcoin's native limitations. (1)

The problem is that Bitcoin *can* natively upgrade, and many of us have been working to perform this upgrade. Several solutions have been built. However, Theymos and other associates of Blockstream controls all of the important news sources, and ruthlessly suppresses information and spreads disinformation to prevent upgrading.

Complicating matters is the fact that Blockstream's chief investors are actually many of the companies which stand to lose the most if a decentralized money should ever take off.

Maybe they see their investment as a hedge. Or maybe they are straight up paying for sabotage.

In the end, they have a profit motive to suppress Bitcoin and are acting on it using censorship, banning, and disinformation. That makes them malactors, and reddit is one of their chief weapons.

(1) the key limitation is what is called a block size limit. This was a temporary measure added years ago when Bitcoin was truly in its infancy to stop a specific type of attack that is no longer a particular threat due to the fact that it would be ~2000x more expensive today than it was when the limit was added. Blockstream has instead used this *temporary* limitation as a way to *permanently* limit the capacity of the network.";11;1;False;jessquit;daf8q5f;With the public spotlight on Reddit censorship, now would be the perfect time to let the rest of Reddit know about the censorship on /r/bitcoin;5eqvhs;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5eqvhs/with_the_public_spotlight_on_reddit_censorship/
"1. Yes
2. It's dishonest if nothing else.
3. This is the heart of the controversy. Bitcoin has hit a limit to how far it can scale, but it's only there because of a technicality (the hardware and software can support more users, but for a single line of code preventing it). With consensus, this limit can be lifted quite quickly and easily. The comments being deleted are the ones promoting reaching that consensus - instead, the only comments allowed are ones promoting a complex, controversial workaround. A workaround which, I might add, would be good and useful alongside the simple one - they don't have to be mutually exclusive.
