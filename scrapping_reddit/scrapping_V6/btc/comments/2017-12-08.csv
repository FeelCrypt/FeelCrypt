"> Uh yes it is. it grows until it saturates.

Stability that comes exclusively from adoption is not an intrinsic feature because it depends on external factors. It cannot be achieved with solely the inherent features of the technology.

>There's always cost at the intersection of fiat and crypto. So you have to pay the cost to get the crypto to send for free.

>Cryptocurrencies only ""provide secure international transactions at no cost"" if you were already holding them anyway.

>Get it??

You're describing an initial start-up cost. Not a repeated cost paid at every transaction.

You asked who would want to invest this start-up cost if BTC was inflationary, and I gave you the example: people who want to engage in international trade using BTC (both to buy and sell) so that they can avoid transaction costs.

It's not that complicated. The technology has plenty of desirable features that justify the start-up cost, but then it has one feature that actually penalizes spending -- which is the #1 function a currency needs to perform. That alone means that this is not a currency. 

>I do not see a negative adoption feedback loop represented here over any significant time period, adoption only seems to go up.

The negative feedback loop is not for adoption. It's for *volatility*. I thought that was plainly clear within context.

If major vendors refuse to adopt BTC because of the volatility, and BTC needs adoption to achieve stability, then this means that BTC is never going to stabilize.

>Yes, more and more people do this. Eventually, almost anyone investing money is doing at least some of this, if only as a hedge. And eventually when enough people are doing this, then over time the risk and reward will go down, and the variability will go down, and people will see it less as a get-rich-quick scheme and more as a sensible long term thing to hold.

So your fantasy here is that BTC is going to become a ""blue chip"" stock. That's the translation of what you just wrote.

Sorry, but this is delusional.

Stocks represent some kind of actual wealth or production or value that is generated in the economy by a company with actual working people doing actual tangible things.

Stocks don't become ""blue chip"" just because lots of people invest in it. That's not how they work. A stock becomes ""blue chip"" when the company itself grows large and builds a reputation for steady, reliable growth in its sector. That consistent history and reputation is what gives investors the confidence to hold the stocks as long term investments. The investment volume does not on its own produce confidence. The volume of investments is a *consequence* of the confidence that comes from the company's performance.

BTC is nothing like this. It has some $270 billion USD worth of market cap, and not a single penny of it is real wealth. It's 100% purely speculative, and it always will be, because it is not representative of any actual contribution to the world economy. There is no underlying product for which we can track performance of profits. There is no underlying company that can inspire long term confidence. It's just the latest imaginary value plaything of short-term investors. Note: the last imaginary value plaything were the mortgage backed derivatives, and they crashed the global finance sector.

"Actually if what you're saying is true (and I believe it probably is), then I've already covered the implications of this adjustment in USDT's daily trading volume and its total (~17%) involvement in BTC's 24hr trading volume.

"Unfortunately, the volume of data points that form the whole picture is fairly large and spread out. I will admit that I compiled this information with quite a lot of effort, and it may be clear to you that I am not an academic. I'm just some guy.  And I did my best.  

It's such a deep rabbit hole that it was overwhelming to produce, keeping track of details and connecting dots.

Cheers, friend. There is still plenty more to investigate, such as, beyond general USDT trading volume going into BTC, what percentage of USDT trading volume is done by Bitfinex/Tether directly. I don't know where to begin on that, it might be a task only suitable for a programmer to quantify.;15;0;False;peptocurrency;dqyqh9p;Guess who controls over half a billion Tethers across 3 exchanges—over 73% of USDT currently in circulation.;7ih0hd;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7ih0hd/guess_who_controls_over_half_a_billion_tethers/
"If you check out the Poloniex-A address, you'll see that there has been a ton of activity. USDT being sent to many different addresses. It's such an active account that 20 pages back into its history is only 20 hours old. One of Tether's proposed uses from its own website is to enhance arbitrage trading. I don't yet know *what* they're doing with the Tether, I only know what the data has told me: that they control 73% of it, and that *someone* is trading BTC/USDT on these exchanges, to the tune of over a billion dollars daily collectively, and possibly more (if Bitfinex is indeed using USDT and not actual USD). I'm not yet at the point of being able to accurately detail every granular aspect of how it's being done or by whom.  

And something u/imaginary_username has pointed out is that USDT is frequently being transferred to and from all of these exchange wallets. Which is something you do when you're engaged in arbitrage. USDT's value fluctuates against the USD and BTC frequently enough that it can be used as an exceptional arbitrage instrument. The main reason to maintain large USDT balances is so that your profits don't fluctuate with the BTC market while you're not trading. By quickly trading into and back out of BTC across multiple exchanges, while maintaining your USDT balance, you can see fairly stable profit. Plus, it's not like they don't hold BTC. Bitfinex-A currently holds over 82 BTC. The Bittrex account holds over 19 and Poloniex-A holds 2. Nothing earth-shattering. Thanks for sharing your inquisitiveness.

"Because trades don't occur between exchange >> user. They occur between user >> user. The exchange doesn't need a reserve, they're more of a 3rd party facilitator for the activity of trading. User-A buys BTC for USDT, while User-B sells USDT for BTC. user A now owns USDT. User B now owns BTC. When they want to withdraw, there's no problem, because it's theirs. They own it. The problem arises when an exchange starts trading user funds. Or equally as bad, trading within their own exchange, manipulating prices against its users. (This occurs frequently in the Forex markets).  

Next, assuming exchanges *do* carry some kind of reserve (they have to profit after-all), they likely get that reserve from exchange fees and services (not to be confused with transaction fees).  

Next, let's say an exchange *does* want to hold its own reserve, not built off fees. Just their own private stash to trade with.   

It doesn't make sense that these accounts belong to these exchanges, because of the transaction patterns present across all these addresses.

"First, let me say that I forgot to thank you for your research and original post before I submitted my comment. Clearly there are enough breadcrumbs to say with certainty that there is something fishy and it´s work like yours and Bitfinex´ed that is helping putting the pieces together. Especially with the BTC price so overextended a Tether / Bitfinex collapse could create a Mt. Gox like 2013 scenario that will plunge the whole crypto market into another winter. Your point of arbitrage trading makes sense to me, someone pointed out in a post several days ago that Giancarlo Devasini replied on bitcointalk in 2014 that he was working on an arbitrage bot. Bitfinex´ed also points out: ""The ‘Chief Strategy Officer’ of Bitfinex, Phil Potter runs a Bitcoin arbitrage hedge fund"" in this post https://medium.com/@bitfinexed/fake-it-till-you-make-it-when-bitfinex-themselves-used-to-spoof-their-entire-orderbook-18294585338

Still, the pieces of the puzzle don´t fit together yet, but these are definetely some (probably not all) of the pieces. I thought it would be interesting to list them to build a mindmap to see how they fit and what´s missing
* USDT minting scam
* arbitrage trading
* bitfinex uses wash trades to prop up their order book - to look like largest BTC exchange
* covering losses from bitfinex hack to stay afloat

I´m missing a ponzi component. Why? If they have a working arbitrage bot, then all is well - they make money - everyone is happy. 

Why do they keep minting new USDT and attract scrutiny and thus jeopardize the stability of both Bitfinex and Tether.
There seem to be only 2 answers:
- Greed. Because they want more money. Seems not likely to me as this has reached a level where surely all material needs are met for the people who got in on the ground floor.
- Instability. They have to mint more because otherwise the whole thing will blow up.  Something isn´t working, or something is burning so much money that it requires a constant flow of new cash. 
This is to me the missing component. Where is the instability in this setup and what is the need / motivation to mint more USDT and keep pushing the BTC price up.

They have built 2 massive, mainstream projects. Why would they gamble?

"Alts are tied to BTC and would undoubtedly incur massive losses in such a scenario. Here's how you protect yourself from a crash. 

1. The CFTC recently approved the listing of crypto derivatives. This means you can hedge against price drops in the capital markets. OKex also includes these products, although I'm not sure if they can actually honor the contracts in case of a market collapse. Perhaps you should consider buying call options for 2-3 months ahead of time.
2. Alternatively, you can cash out all your bitcoins into USD, which means you have close to zero risk (hold them on Coinbase where you're covered by the FDIC guarantee). Then buy call options that allow you to purchase bitcoins at a certain price (hopefully at discount), with no obligation to execute. That way your money is safe (stored in fiat), and you still won't miss the train if BTC keeps climbing.

"I'm afraid this is poorly written. It's hard to tell what you are even trying to prove. When someone writes 'Wait there's more' at a point when they haven't even proven anything yet, it's a bad sign. It means they think they are proving things when they are not.

Maybe I am just dense. Perhaps opening with a thesis statement summing up everything you intend to prove before you prove it, would help.

">Am I saying BTC is being propped up by Tether? I haven't gotten that far yet. Is 6% to 17%+ of daily BTC trading volume enough to move its price? I don't know.

Easily. People make fun of this notion because they think that the amount of tethers would never be able to move the price, which is true. But it absolutely could be if they bought at key times, like when the price dips. Which makes it look like the coin will only keep rising since they prop it up at every dip, which incentivizes more buying.

It may be sketchy but that's the truth -- it's not a secret or surprising.  I don't think they say otherwise.  The CMC volume is not accurate (it used to be, but it isn't now).  In reality, all ""USD"" trading on bitfinex is USDT.  It's just that they used to offer real USD trading and the volume tracking was never updated.  Bitfinex doesn't allow actual withdrawals or deposits of dollars.  The whole premise of this article is off base: yes, USD on bitfinex is USDT, everyone should know that.

">These are the only people/companies who need to move tether.  

Yeah. Tether & Bitfinex. You're right.  

>Why would polo and bittrex be okay with their names being on those addresses if they didn't control them?

For the same reason Coinbase would be cool with their name on an address that contained 1,000 LTC. That's where the LTC is being stored. At Coinbase.  

You're assuming that the name on the address is the designation of who owns it. But what my post has laid out, is that these addresses are named after the location of where the most Tether exists, not who owns it.  

If the names represented who owns it, we'd see Tether's Rich List as:

Tether Limited  
Tether Limited  
Tether Limited  
Tether Limited  

>Why would Bitfinex put other exchange's names on the addresses if bitfinex own them?  

Because it's a shnazzy little feature on Tether's website to designate where the most Tether currently exists. It's marketing. Having one name on all the addresses isn't nearly as interesting or effective for adoption as listing multiple different names, bringing attention to exchanges that currently transact in USDT.

I'm a bit confused. Surely once it's in a Bittrex or Polo address, you cannot determine ownership of the Tether. It's possibly been sold on those exchanges and is thus internally accounted for, distributed across many accounts. The Tether will likely remain in that initial account unless users attempt to withdraw usdt which they will very rarely do as it's just used as a parking instrument on those exchanges. Assuming users came knocking on tethers door asking for the dollars, and assuming Tether has the dollars in reserve, all is good?

"It's in the legal terms where it explicitly states:

>Tethers are not money and are not monetary instruments. They are also not stored value or currency. There is no contractual right or other right or legal claim against us to redeem or exchange your Tethers for money. We do not guarantee any right of redemption or exchange of Tethers by us for money.  

How much more clear does it get? This ***directly contradicts*** what their website says on the front-freakin-page: that Tether is backed 1:1 by USD. So which is it?? This creates a skewed view of the value of USDT. Later in the legal terms, Tether and Bitfinex are both held legally irresponsible for any ***skewed perception of USDT's value as a result of claims made on either of their websites.***

So they are literally saying, ""We can claim USDT is worth $1. But it's not, really. And if you suffer economically as a result of believing it's worth $1, it's not our fault, because we said it's not actually worth anything in these terms of service.""

Lastly, comes the issue of audits. Their front page again claims they'll be audited frequently. They have not once been audited since their inception in 2014. Funny that nowhere on their legal terms page is the word ""audit"" mentioned.";6;2;False;peptocurrency;dqyx8ga;Guess who controls over half a billion Tethers across 3 exchanges—over 73% of USDT currently in circulation.;7ih0hd;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7ih0hd/guess_who_controls_over_half_a_billion_tethers/

If these transanctions are have questionable natures, why do you think Bitfinex or the higher entity would reveal all their money flows in public for you and everyday joe to investigate? What's preventing them from making completely hidden transactions underground (i.e. transferring private keys directly) so that no one can be ever sure where the money is? I am all for hardcore journalism, but I don't think analyzing omniexplorer is the way to go, as it can be pretty misleading and quite questionable in terms of revealing shady activities.;0;1;False;bow_chika_wow_wow;dqyxkwr;Guess who controls over half a billion Tethers across 3 exchanges—over 73% of USDT currently in circulation.;7ih0hd;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7ih0hd/guess_who_controls_over_half_a_billion_tethers/

"what I don´t understand and assuming Tether is unbacked and some scam (which seems close to proven): When Tether / Bitfinex mints new USDT they themselves know that they are worthless. Why would they keep the USDT balance? Wouldn´t they immediately sell them for something with real value like BTC? 

Even if the idea is to wash trade back and forth manipulating BTC price with huge trading volume, the USDT balance shouldn´t be 73% as something like half of the assets would be in BTC at any given time. But why would they maintain large USDT balances?
Wouldn´t it be a simpler and better scam to just print useless USDT, sell them for BTC and hodl them?

It has been suggested by Bitfinex´ed that this started as a hail marry solution to prevent Bitfinex from going under after the hack. But wouldn´t they have made enough money to cover losses and then some. If they sold their $800 million USDT into BTC over the past months there must be a profit in the billions somewhere...";8;1;False;ethfiend2064;dqyvyok;Guess who controls over half a billion Tethers across 3 exchanges—over 73% of USDT currently in circulation.;7ih0hd;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7ih0hd/guess_who_controls_over_half_a_billion_tethers/

I never said it was being propped up. I lined this out right inside the post that this is ***not*** the conclusion I'm trying to come to. It can be inferred, but there isn't enough evidence.

While that may be true, I do not care.  Maybe that's where it is at the moment, but we can probably agree that is not the intent of bitcoin.

I like bitcoin, I've made money off of bitcoin, and I see it still growing exponentially.  That's where my concerns end. 

 I see BCH as a cheap knock off of BTC, and that's about it.  This toxic ass sub is a big turn off to BCH, and Roger Ver annoys me to no end.  He reminds me of a Joel Osteen type, and his ""I'm a millionaire"" routine is insulting.  And the whole ASICBOOST thing is concerning to say the least.

Good luck on BCH, I want no part of it.  I do have my hand in probably a dozen cryptos, I have very little confidence in BCH.  I love watching the price of BTC go up, and hope that it continues, I don't see it stopping any time soon.  Once BTC figures out transaction fees and time, BCH is in for a world of hurt.  I don't care if it's a year from now.

"I hope we can argue over the arguments and not fall into the trap of name calling and polarization, because I find it more rewarding and interesting to learn from each other. Maybe you can learn me a thing or two. 

Anyway, here is my take on Bitcoin vs Bitcoin Cash with the limited knowledge I've accumulated over the years.

Quite a few think Bitcoin should just be a 'digital gold'. I think this is a mistake because competing cryptocurrencies also act as a store of value. What determines the market cap in the long run is its usefulness, so it has to be a medium of exchange as well. Remember that gold itself is useful as it is used for jewelry and luxury products.
  
Bitcoin have a massive infrastructure lead (hence the market cap), but there is no guarantee that this will last. If Bitcoin continues to lose merchants, business and users that want to use it as cash, this will eventually hurt Bitcoins market position, even if speculators drive up the price in the short term. In the end, speculators are buying Bitcoin in the hopes that someone else will buy if for a higher price.

Now for the arguments over the blocksize. 

I favor the view that more decentralization comes with greater adoption, even if it risks some centralization today. Getting more people into the space will encourage new ideas, use cases and products. Of course, on the way, some people and some businesses will benefit a LOT. But this have always been the case of economic history. On the way at building something great, some people get extremely rich. My view is that we should focus on baking a bigger pie, rather than fighting over how to equally share a small pie. 
  
I view the blocksize debate as a debate over innovation in processing power vs innovation in storage. From my knowledge, Moore's law have been broken in processing power. And please correct me if I’m wrong, but there seems to be a lot of progress and innovation in storage. So for me, it seems like there is more ‘upside’ from innovation in storage than innovation in processing power. If the cost of storage drops and capacity increases significantly, increasing the blocksize seems like a reasonable approach. So even if a cost of a node goes up now, it will become cheaper over time. And with mass adoption there will be established non-profit nodes, for-profit nodes, charity-nodes and so on. This will add to the security of the network. 
 
Further I don't think Bitmain's lead will last. Innovation is happening incredible fast, and the economic incentive to disrupt the mining sector is extremely high. Bitmain may keep their advantage for quite a while, but that's because they, for the time being, offer the most profitable mining hardware.

On a moral level I think it’s much more important that people can afford to use bitcoin, rather than afford to run a node. Most people want to use something that works, and most people are not going to understand (because they don't care) how money works. Ask your mum to run a node or get your friends to explain the monetary system. Not gonna happen.
 
If you could choose between two similar products, but one cost less than a penny to use, while the other cost a dollar or more, then over time people choose the cheapest one. Economics 1-2-3. For the time beeing Bitcoin Cash have this advantage over Bitcoin. Bitcoin Cash also have faster transaction times. However, if Bitcoin decides to increase the blocks or implement lightning network which proves to work great for users, then Bitcoin Cash might fail. My point is, Bitcoin is on a clock and I think we are still somewhat far from successfully implementing second layer solutions like lightning network. Segwit is still far from being used by many on the Bitcoin network even though it got activated this summer.

I think that Bitcoin Cash is not opposed to second layer solution, just that not at the expense of layer one. If it's going to be a global monetary system 1 MB blocks are just not viable.  

For the time being, with the knowledge I have accumulated, I have put most of my money in Bitcoin Cash. I might be completely wrong and lose everything, but that's a risk I’m willing to take. It's exciting times to be alive and I wish both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash the best of luck.

"The inherent risk at this point is just slow to confirm transactions and high fees.  It makes it unusable for purchasing a lot of everyday things.  Though many do claim to get quick confirmations with $1 or lower fees, it does not seem to be the norm.

If there are a lot of transactions with decent fees, I think miners will keep mining what is profitable.  I do not think there is a high risk of a flippening right now.  The new BCH DAA seems to leave the mining in favor of BTC.

BTC could hit $50k or be worth $2k tomorrow.  A lot depends on what you see crypto to be.  An investment or a new transaction space for paying for anything and everything.  For sure, if you had BTC a few months ago, then you have the same in BCH.  One or both will be worth a lot more than both are today, someday.  I still do not know if that is today or 20 years from now.

If you are investing, do not invest more than you can lose.  Despite my very positive outlook, Governments could find ways to make all of your current investments in Crypto go poof.  Or some horrible security flaw could render everyone's coins unsafe.  Or a thousand other possibilities that I cannot imagine.  My point is, you could lose it all.

"That's close to the way it works when you fund the Bitpay Visa. I started a transaction on Nov 25 that didn't confirm until Dec 4th (after a miner put it in a block for me). They only require 1 confirmation for that. As soon as you get the 1st confirmation you can start spending the money from the Visa card.

Here are my loads to the card with rough confirmation times.

* 795 bytes fee: 0.00002394 BTC (3 per byte) 8,650.00 exchange rate - fee $0.21 (9+ days, used accelerator)

* 617 bytes fee: 0.00004326 BTC (7 per byte) 5,222.83 exchange rate - fee ~$0.23 (2+ days to confirm, used accelerator)
* 257 bytes fee: 0.00010836 BTC (42 per byte) 4,599.10 exchange rate - fee ~$0.50 (4 hours to confirm)

I don't know why they do it differently for 3rd party (maybe newegg sets the behavior).

Either way I hate that Bitpay ""refunds"" by tripling your BTC fees. Best case if they refund, you end up
