Pandora's box has been opened. Just because a crypto becomes destabilized, doesn't mean the world would be willing to go back to fiat or fed coin or whatever.

They don't need to do it off the balance sheet.  They have infinite leverage.  During the financial crisis they conjured up $3 trillion in dollars via quantitative easing.  They are only now about to start slowly winding that down.

How it works:  They buy Treasury bonds & mortgage backed securities from member banks.  The banks get paid by a credit on their account with the Fed.

"Like I said before, Pandora's box had been opened. People understand what a decentralized crypto currency means and the moment traditional fiat world reserve currencies start to destabilize, crypto is coming next. You won't be able to force people to use fiat except at the point of a gun. I'm no saying some governments aren't going to try to do that, but that can only continue so long.

We agree that crypto vs. fiat changes the game. I'm just saying that if a government controls a massive supply of a reserve crypto currency they have already won. They don't need to destabilize it because everyone else in the world is using the thing they control. Rather than release a ton of crypto that people could pick up for pennies on the dollar (so to speak) wouldn't they rather just release a tiny amount to complete the mission at hand? All the while collecting back a ton of it in taxes. 

Let's say a single government controlled all the world's gold. Do you think they would try to destabilize a gold standard? 

Now let's say China or Russia or some other power controls massively more crypto than USA. Do you think they are just going to roll over while the USA tries to force the rest of the world back on the dollar?

"I'm not sure if to be flattered by being called ""a typical redditor"" after a couple of posts =)

The issue here is that you have exposure to British media, which, as you point here, is anti-EU, and not after second referendum, and that helps you in balancing the information you get from the media. Now, I'll take your word on the state of the British media, but C-Span is an American network, and our discussion here is about that network. American people do not have balanced exposure to opinions, and so cannot parse away the bias here the same way you do.

Our discussion was about whether or no C-Span is biased, let's go back to that. You can easily convince me that they are not biased: if you can point me to a few quality pieces they have authored which are praising Trump, praising the tremendous positive contribution of Putin to the Russian society, pro-Brexit, anti-EU, and/or questioning whether climate change is man-made or natural. I am just asking for a few, not for 50% of their articles.

> In the 3rd title, it is ""Theresa May"", ""Won't say"", ""Second referendum"". The media is trying to make the reader take the existence of ""Second referendum"" as given

That's simply not true. She was asked a hypothetical question. Again, a wide range of mainstream and independent outlets reported her response to this question. The majority of these outlets *do not want a second referendum*, despite your bias against the press.

> no one should be forced to disclose what they voted

She wasn't being asked how she voted. Plus she was a key campaigner for Remain, so everyone already knew how she voted.

>  WHAT second referendum? What is the meaning of having a 2nd referendum?

Err, if you followed british politics this wouldn't be such a mystery for you. It's the Lib Dems' platform that there be a second referendum once we know what the deal with the EU would look like. That's neither Labour's nor the Tories' position.

> Are referendums to be repeated until people vote in a way that the media defines as ""correct""?

You do realise that the british media has been rabidly anti-EU for decades? Our press is considerably to the right of your press.
