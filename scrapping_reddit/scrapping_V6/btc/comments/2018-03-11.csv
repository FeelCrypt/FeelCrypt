"Well, if you really *tried* to generate losses, it would be relatively straigthforward and prettey low-risk. The ""1 year"" thing opens a lot of possibilites:

Example:
  * buy 10 alts (and BTC, BCH)
  * wait 11.9 months
  * the 1 or 2 that go up you keep for > 1 year for tax-free profit
  * the ones that go down you sell < 1 year for potentially tax-deductable loss. If you'd like to stay in that particular coin, you can buy it back right away, so no harm done in case it turns out as a good investment.

Of course with this scheme you really *do* suffer those losses, but the idea is that by distributing across many alts and BTC those losses will be offset by the gains of the others view that *do* go up.

The ""Jahresfrist"" is not a good solution if you look at things from ""both sides"", I think: for the Behörden it means a lot of wiggle room for the tax-payer to structure his shit, for the taxpayer it's a huge burden.

If I was any authority I would suggest the following special taxation scheme for cryptos:

  * you pay a flat tax (say 15%) on all proceeds (not just gains) from selling crypto, but only when selling crypto against fiat directly, not when trading altcoins or buying Pizza.

Yes, that would mean you have to pay the 15% when you go ""in"" and ""out"" of crypto (vs. EUR). And yes, it would mean that people could freely (from tax) use crypto as money for payments and they could make all the gains the want from trading crypto against other crypto as long as they don't swap to EUR.

I think both sides would have strong objections against this kind of a deal and that makes me think it might be a good one ;-)

"1) The Bitpay & Copay wallets are free, and available for all smartphone & laptop platforms.

2) Over the next month or so, other wallets (Bitcoin.com Wallet, Bread/BRD wallet, etc) will likely start supporting BIP70 for BCH.  At that point, people can switch to those wallets. Nobody is locked into anything.

3) There are other payment processors, like Coinbase.com, Coinify (mainly in Europe), etc.

4) All wallets still work with all other payment processors. Just because a wallet supports BIP70 doesn't mean that it can ONLY transact with Bitpay merchants.  Nobody is locked into anything.

5) The purpose of BIP70 is to [reduce errors](https://blog.bitpay.com/bitpay-and-payment-protocol/).  In order for cryptocurrency to go mainstream, the whole payment process had to progress beyond manual copying & pasting, and manually entering amounts.  In fact, we're headed to a world where people will just put products in their bag, and just [walk out of stores](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrmMk1Myrxc) without manually checking out or doing anything.

6) When Netscape was the dominant browser, webmasters had to make sure their websites were compatible with Netscape.  Same deal when IE was the dominant browser.  And same deal, now that Chrome is the dominant browser.  

- When a webmaster makes sure their website works with the current dominant browser, their website will still work with other browsers, and it doesn't prevent other browsers from later becoming #1.

- When a wallet maker makes sure their wallet works with the current dominant payment processor, their wallet will still work with other payment processors, and it doesn't prevent other payment processors from later becoming #1.

Keep in mind that we want BCH to be the #1 everyday cryptocurrency.  And in that world, wallet makers will have to adhere to BCH standards & protocols if they want to interact with BCH.  Just like Bitpay's position today.

There are no *additional* taxes for paying with Bitcoin. That simply means that you don't have to pay VAT when exchanging crypto for fiat. (This only sounds obvious because you're used to it! In a way, it's actually quite surprising that you can buy Bitcoin in Germany without paying VAT on the purchase.)

But you still have to pay taxes on your capital gains. If your bitcoin are worth more when you exchange them for goods than they were when you bought them, you pay taxes on the difference. (Unless you held them for more than 1 year.)

I understand that view from a customers perspective, but look at it this way: if all merchants accepting BCH are using Bitpay because there is nothing else right now that can compete in a direct way, wallet developers are either forced to integrate BIP70, which I heard is a pain in the ass, or risk users going to other wallets. In other words: there is no choice from a business perspective. So they’ll do it. Merchants get used to Bitpay, no need in changing something that works so competition is going to have a hard time. What do you think happens when they make another mandatory BIP for their product without any consensus whatsoever after all wallets support BIP70? They get a lot of power by doing this and I, as a merchant, am not supporting it. Newegg is because they don’t care about you or crypto or anything, they care about their dollars.
