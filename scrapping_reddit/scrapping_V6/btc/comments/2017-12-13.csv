"Significant amount of people is VISA level transactions: 2.000 tx pr second. Bitcoin does something like 4 tx/s at 1 mb/10 min. That would equal 500 mb blocks for the same amount of tx/s (VISA *can* handle 24.000 tx pr sec at peak) - and thats just VISA. If you end up with it costing 20k to run a node, then people **will** have to rely on 3rd parties to validate transactions - that introduces trust, and equals centralization.

"Measuring success by price only is the fatal downfall of Bitcoin. The concept of decentralized **currency** is dead in BTC as it currently stands and yet the community is okay with that because the price is going up and more people are investing (which are very mutual events). As soon as the userbase stops pumping, the price will stagnate, causing the people who invested only for quick gains to cash out and likely causing a major correction if not outright downward spiral. 

When the majority of interest in a concept is coming from the hope of profits, a bubble is formed, and as soon as the price stops going up, the bubble bursts. BCH price being low is arguably a good thing, because it means that the majority of the community has an organic interest in the concept of fast, cheap, secure, decentralized transacting.";2;0;False;iAmAddicted2R_ddit;dr6w7k1;"Blockchair.com: ""There have been some suggestions to alter the whitepaper hosted on bitcoin.org.

"That citation claims that the original bitcoin whitepaper - basically blockchain RFC - ""tricks people into thinking"" something else that Cobra wants it to mean.

It actively lies that the paper is not reference, that there are other versions of it and most blatant lie is that it heavily implies that Satoshi himself approves modifying it (however we have everything on file and no it has never happened).

It also implies that anything promoted by it is a crazy toxic idea. That it is outdated for academic use.

I like how Cobra acknowledges that bitcoin core is diverged from the paper. 

After reading this I'm almost 90% sure Cobra is part of intelligence services just because of the way the post is done. It's like from a Russian KGB propaganda playbook.

Appeal and bending of sanity, intelligence, logic and authority. That's just abuse of that playbook.

"Because peer-reviewed papers are not meant to be modified by anyone, not even the authors themselves. If the author wanted to make a change, he resubmits as a separate paper; this is how it is done in academia to maintain integrity. You don't simply go around modifying people's papers, even if the errors are mere typos.  

Code changes are a different story. Usually, the author reviews the changes before accepting them into the codebase. The situation for Bitcoin is complex because the original author is AFK and the designated guy in charge (Gavin Andresen) got shunned from Core so in a sense, the code changes are without permission. 

Therefore, just because they can make changes to the code itself, does not mean they can rewrite Satoshi's words.

So I read about how Lightning Network that core is trying to implement works in detail, and I found it one of the most retarded concepts ever. Like, can someone explain to me if I am missing something. They want people to deposit btc as a tab to allow high transaction volume. Like, I want coffee and I first have to deposit on a multisig wallet my money in advance, just so I can buy coffee multiple times with less fee? Wtf? How about just keep the fees low like in BCH so we don't need to create solutions to problems that don't need to exist. I find it astonishing that people take lightening network serious as a solution to the scaling problem.;4;2;False;Muke888;dr6s8n4;"Blockchair.com: ""There have been some suggestions to alter the whitepaper hosted on bitcoin.org.

">I've been noticing that the Bitcoin paper at https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf is getting a lot of traffic (mainly from people searching for ""bitcoin paper"", or probably seeing it cited by other papers). Almost all the people reading the paper are probably reading it for the first time, and using it as a learning resource. However since the paper is so outdated, I believe it doesn't do a good job anymore of giving people a firm understanding of Bitcoin (at least the modern version). There is no mention of things like pools, and the Privacy and SPV sections could probably be updated.

>The paper links to bitcoin.org, but I feel like the Bitcoin described in the paper and the Bitcoin described on bitcoin.org are starting to diverge. **At some point, I think the paper will start to do more harm than good, because it tricks people into believing they understand Bitcoin.

Academics are also regularly citing the paper and basing some of their reasoning and arguments on this outdated paper.

>Normally issues like this in other projects would be solved by regularly updating the learning resources, and documents, such as producing new editions or versions of the document to keep it in line with the current status of the project. I'd be interested to know the community's thoughts and opinions on this issue, since I know it's likely to be a divisive but some rational debate would be good, because it could become more of a problem in the future.

>There are already a few different versions of the paper out there, so Satoshi has already set the precedent that the paper should be updated to reflect the current realities of the software. I believe the paper was always designed to be a high level overview of the current reference implementation, and that we should update it now that the paper is outdated and the reference implementation has changed significantly from 2009

People naturally disagreed with it and offered solutions.. then Greg Maxwell comes in here saying this is an attack from r/BTC and people are abusing cobra, he ""of course wasn't proposing an update to the original and now people are bullying him and making him not want to create open discussions"". Then someone rational tries to talk to him and explain where the confusion lies and only gets attacked by Greg. It was night and day the way people were earlier  discussing their opinions and reasons as to why they thought that way, and Maxwell changes the entire thread to be an attack and poor cobra didn't mean what you think when cobra never replied to clarify his proposals (it was a proposal and he did want to update the original).

The problem here lies with Greg answering for other people falsely and trying to defend someone because his actions were now receiving backlash. It's like a mother letting her son torture an animal but when other people notice and look down on it, the mother will defend and attack people saying they are wrong and her son never did that!

"**Basic income**

A basic income (also called basic income guarantee, citizen's income, unconditional basic income, universal basic income (UBI), or universal demogrant) is a form of social security in which all citizens or residents of a country receive a regular, unconditional sum of money, either from a government or some other public institution, independent of any other income. An unconditional income transfer that is considered insufficient to meet a person's basic needs (or below the poverty line), is sometimes called a partial basic income, while one at or greater than that level is sometimes called a full basic income. Besides national basic income, full or partial, it can also be local or regional basic income. Some welfare systems are more or less related to basic income but also have some strings and/or are restricted to ""The poor"" in a region.

>  But if that is indeed what he would say, then yes, my post stands as a rejection of both of you.

Firstly, if by ""rejection of both of you"" you mean ""a rejection of both of your positions"" then that would be unwarranted. I haven't given a position for you to reject, I've only given you a representation of /u/GayloRen's position.

Secondly, if you mean to reject ....
> The debate becomes intellectually dishonest and ""petty"" when carried out at the level of accusations of motive or hidden agendas.

... by having your post stand (""my post stands""), you need to either:

* Hold that the claim entails the view that  in the debate neither ""manipulated heavily"" nor that (unjust) censorship has taken place; or
* Agree that the claim doesn't entail that view.

You've done neither.

Thirdly, if you mean to reject it by calling this ""concern trolling"" and you mean a ""concern troll is someone who is on one side of the discussion, but pretends to be a supporter of the other side with ""concerns"" (https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=concern%20troll) then this is just repeating a basic intellectual dishonesty by engaging in the fallacy of [an appeal to motive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_motive).

Operating with integrity entails not engaging in such basic ad hominem fallacies.

/u/GayloRen's position has several prongs:

* There is a debate over the merits of BTC versus BCH. 
* This debate is important.
* Because the debate is important it should be conducted  at the level of the merits of each.
*  Because the debate is important it should not be conducted in an intellectually dishonest manner.
* The debate becomes intellectually dishonest and ""petty"" when carried out at the level of accusations of motive or hidden agendas.

"**Appeal to motive**

Appeal to motive is a pattern of argument which consists in challenging a thesis by calling into question the motives of its proposer. It can be considered as a special case of the ad hominem circumstantial argument. As such, this type of argument may be an informal fallacy.

A common feature of appeals to motive is that only the possibility of a motive (however small) is shown, without showing the motive actually existed or, if the motive did exist, that the motive played a role in forming the argument and its conclusion.

TAXPAYERS are coughing up $300,000 a minute for a welfare bill that has soared $40 billion in 10 years.

The Herald Sun can reveal that the total lifetime welfare bill for all those currently receiving benefits has been estimated at $2.1 trillion.

The frightening figure emerged as federal government debt reached a record $506 billion yesterday, renewing concerns about the public cost of supporting those who game the system or are locked into a cycle of welfare dependency.

Remarkably, anyone currently receiving government help to study is expected to be on welfare for nearly half of the rest of their lives, costing taxpayers an average of $247,000.

You got rich by doing nothing.  However you understand that Bitcoin has dangerous externalities that others will pay for.  You can also see the price of BCH is remaining solid, adoption is growing and its grassroots support is strong.

Bitcoin (BTC) is for deadbeats that suck resources off society while contributing nothing.

In making that statement I create an analogy.  With many people rushing into Bitcoin to get rich quick the statement I made could be said for the wave of current and future speculators in the broadest most demeaning way. Lets hope Bitcoin Cash holders are a little more refined.

In hindsight, I regret having made it for them, but everything I said in the video, even with what we know today, was factually true.

"You 'use' core? Why, what is it that makes you use it? Is it because you enjoy paying exorbitant fees or do you just love these long waiting times, please enlighten us.

I can see only two reasons why someone would 'use' (if you can call it that) Bitcoin Core: you are desperate or you are dumb. So either you already have them, or want to buy something that is only available with Bitcoin Core. Or you are simply retarded and enjoy throwing away money while waiting days for it to arrive.

"OMG sorry. I completely misread your post. I read ""ten thousand years *before* jewelry"". I even quoted it :D Apologies again.

Let's start anew:

That's exactly my point. Gold coins have nothing to do with jewelry. When the whole ""gold standard"" idea started, which I think we can agree is when the first coins were issued, gold had been already known for a long time. At the time, it was no more a store of value than a Lamborghini is today: it was a status symbol. Now, when commerce among distant cities and states skyrocketed (6th century BC), people needed something they could **store** (important: not **exchange**) and carry on in their travels. It is important to notice that day-to-day trade was conducted with barter up until the XV century. Gold was never used as a mean of exchange: no one used gold coins to ""buy a coffee"", or copper either. Gold was just the best candidate because it was present in a limited amount, it was easy to manufacture (which now we agree had been known for 5 millennia) and could ""compact"" value in a small weight. Also, no one used to think about making jewelry out of their coins: if anything, it was the other way round. Basically, the gold coin lost all its connection to being pretty or useful. In fact, just as we hold gold bars as a store of value, we also have platinum bars today, or rough diamonds. Just as the gold coins of the past, what all these things have in common is that they are supplied in limited amounts. Basically, they're all ""collectibles"".";5;0;False;RedGolpe;dr70qg7;"There is a word for a ""store of value"" with no underlying utility, and that word is ""collectible""";7jivvf;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7jivvf/there_is_a_word_for_a_store_of_value_with_no/

With the exception that gold has been a store of value for millenniums and has a magnitude less volitivity. I would not trust any cryptocurrency to not crash to zero, I got into Bitcoin because It could actually be used as an efficient medium of exchange.

"No, no. I get what you are saying but I cannot agree with that.

Price of an object depends on (i)demand, and (ii) supply. Scarcity only deals with one of those aspects. Scarcity has no effect on demand by itself. The demand for gold came because of its utility as a currency (beginning at Egypt circa. 500 BC) and because of its use in jewellery .

Some of it's properties made Gold extremely useful as a currency - such as being fungible, malleable, easy to move, and being resistant to corrosion, etc. Those properties made gold a proper utility and that brought demand; and that demand, coupled with low supply, made gold extremely valuable.

Coming to Bitcoin now, Bitcoin does not share some of those essential properties of gold that made it suitable as a currency. (i) Bitcoin is not truly fungible, and (ii) Bitcoin does not share the non-corrosive property of gold (as some of is ""wasted away"" every time you try use it). That makes Bitcoin unsuitable for usage as a currency. The only remaining use-case of Bitcoin, barring that, I can think of is transferring large amounts of wealth between borders/jurisdictions without documentation. While that is a valid use case, it serves a very small niche of the world's population. If demand comes primarily from that, Bitcoin (BTC) is probably very over-valued at this point.

There are lots of things that are scarce but are not a good store of value.

Iridium, Osmium, Rhenium, Ruthenium, and Rhodium are all more scarce than Gold. Yet, of them, only one metal (Rhodium) is more valuable than gold.

That would suggest that mere scarcity doesn't give something value. 

Scarcity will cause something to have a high value only when there is enough demand for it. Demand comes from the number of use cases a particular product can serve. As of now, Bitcoin (BTC) has extremely limited use cases.

What makes you think that? Where did I say anything linking tx fee and market cap?  

Edit: as for difficulty to use, increase in fees will increase the difficulty since now you need to calculate how large the tx will be, and figure out how many sat/byte you need to have the tx processed in time. Hope you don't miscalculate and overpay or have your tx pruned from the mempools. Not much that devs can do to fix this other than reducing fees.

As well if you keep coins in separate addresses, combining these increases the tx size -> fees increase. If fees get too high many of these addresses with ""dust"" will be effectively dead.

Considering how some hodlers' life have changed, I can argue that yes, they make you prettier. Jokes aside, I still don't believe a gold coin is prettier than a copper one. The jewelry you make out of gold is probably irrelevant as a store of value: again, gold's true value is in its scarcity.
