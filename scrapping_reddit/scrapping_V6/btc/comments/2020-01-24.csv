"I touched on this briefly, but if they can't get enough unidentified miners onboard I suspect that they'll drop the proposal altogether. They certainly didn't do this to cause a chain split, and I don't see why they would proceed in the face of overwhelming opposition.
That said I think most miners will probably get on board.

I'm just responding to the repeated objections i've seen. Obviously there can always be issues with implementation and execution that deserve scrutiny, but those are different than saying it's not a good in whole.";1;0;False;Twoehy;ffdgzrv;Hot Take: BCH Funding Proposal is a tempest in a teapot.;esyla1;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/esyla1/hot_take_bch_funding_proposal_is_a_tempest_in_a/
"I really think what the community favors is somewhat beside the point. The community doesn't pay for hashpower. The community doesn't have skin in the game. The ""community"" is a whole lot of armchair quarterbacks telling people that actually have to make things happen how they'd do it better.
If the miners favor it, that's all that matters. If they run into issues with HK they can always move it somewhere else. If they want to move it to an on-chain smart contract they'll do that. 
They have good reasons (since they have to follow the law) to want to set up a business entity and make sure that everything is above board. the ""community"" might not care if they've violating the law, but I bet they do.

Also...how do you think the regular issuance (I assume you mean block reward?) comes about if not through hash work? I genuinely don't get how you think this isn't their money. The costs of inflation are paid by everyone no matter how the block reward is distributed, but the block reward is what we're talking about, and that most definitely belongs to the miners. None of what is being discussed would affect the inflation rate.";1;0;False;Twoehy;ffdgnbc;Hot Take: BCH Funding Proposal is a tempest in a teapot.;esyla1;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/esyla1/hot_take_bch_funding_proposal_is_a_tempest_in_a/
"Do you think it's a controversial stance to think that miners are ultimately in control? Is aligned incentives + skin in the game not enough to dictate which members of the community have the power to unilaterally change the rules?

I do agree that funding address belongs to the miner coalition(commonwealth?) and not to any specific dev team. Dev teams should start bids for work.

I also agree that sinophobia/xenophobia is a large part of this reaction as it has seeped into some more toxic aspects of Western culture (speaking as a born Westerner who regularly talks with Chinese/Hong Kong Natives in their language). I don't trust China either and am aware that Hong Kong is shaky but a company stationed there seems safe enough as long as it's only a company on paper rather than offices.

"That's exactly what will happen if a central company is in control of the funds. People who contribute nothing development-wise, but are good at playing the political games and climbing the social ladder, will get the funds.

The good developers who keep their heads down and ignore politics won't get any of it.

To see an example of this, try getting some of the money from the Ethereum Foundation that it's handing out in grants. Go look at how many hoops you have to jump through, whose hands you have to shake, and whose butts you have to kiss.

"The allocation of these development funds to a centralized entity (currently described vaguely as a ""hong kong corporation"") is extremely dangerous.

1. Who's to say we can trust that they will do a good job of deciding which projects deserve and require appropriate amounts of funding?

2. How can we trust that this central funding corporation will not be captured, such that, even if they originally intended to do a good job, they no longer would be able to?

This wouldn't be so bad if it was just several miners committing some of their block rewards to the project, but they are effectively holding the rest of the miners hostage and forcing them to contribute to this centralized funding entity. (By orphaning non-compliant blocks.) This is sort of hand-waved away as a solution to the ""tragedy of the commons"", but forcing everyone who wants to participate in a decentralized system to contribute to a centralized funding project seems extremely backwards, with the potential to do much more hard than good.

Is it within their power to hold the chain hostage if they collectively have greater than 50% hashpower? Yes. Is it a good idea? No, at least not from what I've seen so far, because it imposes a personal risk on the whole ecosystem.";1;0;False;AD1AD;ffdhb6u;Nothing has changed - what's all the fuss about?;eslrie;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/eslrie/nothing_has_changed_whats_all_the_fuss_about/
