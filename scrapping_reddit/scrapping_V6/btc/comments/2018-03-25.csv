You realize that this might be the single dumbest comment on this thread, right? ;6;1;False;ytrehguodleinad;dw9bve6;Crypto jocks vs. nerds?... (a do-your-homework-doodle);8612wg;https://i.redd.it/836w1ihch3n01.jpg
Yes, 7 cryptos, that is a good list that encompasses the depth of the crypto currency space. Of these (NEO, Ripple, Coinbase, Bitfinex) I would never post in because I don’t believe in / use them. But that’s not the point is it, can we address your initial comment that BTC is a copy of BCASH, I’ll wait. ;2;0;False;ytrehguodleinad;dw9drt5;Crypto jocks vs. nerds?...

Pretty sure he tried to commit murder for hire didn’t he?;1;0;False;jp4ragon;dw9r5df;Ross Ulbricht turns 34 on March 27. It's his fifth birthday spent in a cage.;85y9im;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/85y9im/ross_ulbricht_turns_34_on_march_27_its_his_fifth/
"> he could have saved lives and helped society by dedicating his time to positive social work

That's a silly argument. This guy is just trolling

So you're saying Ross was incapable of using his time and talent for making anything better than Silk Road or anything that could have ended up being better than Silk Road?;1;1;False;gasfjhagskd;dw9szqk;Ross Ulbricht turns 34 on March 27.

The problem is that it updates too quickly for a torrent.  What's needed is some sort of P2P protocol, not unlike the way blockchains distribute new data, but with federation controls to make sure that you aren't sending tons of unwanted data everywhere.  ;1;0;False;SirEDCaLot;dw8q0cl;So in a timeframe of few years, Reddit is going to become a corporate shithole, going the way of Digg.

"Actually for something like this, if you make it centralized you could just build it on top of Reddit's authentication system.  You can already use Reddit to log into other sites, so just do that.  

So the signup process would be like this.  If you're a Reddit user, just click the 'I'm a Reddit user' button.  It then gives you a Reddit app login, which you approve.  Then you can (optionally) pick a password for the new site (in case Reddit turns off their app authentication for the new site).  And you're in.  

Add in that it would make any existing Reddit user go through the app-auth process- so you couldn't register the name of an already existing Reddit user.  Also put a way to automatically post a note to the person's Reddit profile that they've moved to the new site and to join them there.
