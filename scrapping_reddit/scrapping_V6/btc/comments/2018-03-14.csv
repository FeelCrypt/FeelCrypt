"I think the biggest scam is that bch doesn't have the price that btc had. That ""bch"" became the fork, but BTC was the one changing into ""bitelitecoin"" or a significantly different coin, no longer would be peer to peer uncensorable as decentralized or incentivized the same. The economics changed fundamentally, so does the security. 

We will find out if this new coin is hackable. As to why BTC didn't go through the process of finding a new market price like BCH did, you will likely find those who control how the coin forks, have the power over it.

I was insulted told to ""fork off"" and banned. 

The reasons I've been told to keep the 1MB limit are nonsense, no thinking person should accept such shallow answers. 

I say 1MB transaction limit because it used to be called the block size limit, the Core Developers in charge just changed the name to **""non-witness data limit""**, thinking everything will be OK and no one bats an eye? The transaction limit is still restricting total transaction capacity to a measly 1MB, why?  

OH and P.S. we forked off and now we're being accused of stealing the Bitcoin name, attacking Bitcoin. mmm No. 

Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin, it's just upgraded to remove the 1MB transaction limit because there were no valid reasons to keep it in place.
