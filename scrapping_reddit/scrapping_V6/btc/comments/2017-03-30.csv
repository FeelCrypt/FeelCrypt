"Ok, so I think I see where you're coming from, and it's the opposite of what I originally thought. I'm pretty sure we're mostly on the same page, but we can still discuss some of the finer points :)

> Would you be fine with non-coders coding, releasing patches and determining the course of the project? My position is that non-coders should not do that.

I was implying that if you're using Bitcoin with a full wallet, you have to decide which wallet to run. You're either not running a full wallet, or you're running one of the versions we're talking about. I never said non-coders should code, not sure how you got that implication, but coding the implementation isn't the only enlightened position in a project that is capable of understanding how things work.

> There are more people that are not coders or cannot sufficiently evaluate the technical aspects of the debate, than there are coders, this is self evident in the crypto space. Unless you believe that all users are familiar with the codebase of btc

There are plenty of users who understand enough about the protocol and the roles of the different components of the network to have an informed opinion. I think when it comes to the scaling debate, there are plenty of non-coders who understand the implications of what each direction means. Coders aren't automatically economists, being able to turn ideas into code does not necessarily confer a profound top-to-bottom insight into how the code they are writing will impact the network or protocol as a whole. I'm not trying to diminish the role coders have (that's what I do everyday for work). I think there are plenty of coders who would identify with the notion that being able to implement something is sometimes the easy part. 

> I did not say that linux had better hardware support ten years ago, i'm saying that as things are now, linux is by far quicker to respond to bugs, due to the community of coders being quite larger, and the ability to spot and fix bugs is not bottlenecking at the company profits. 

There is certainly a big, diverse community around Linux. But honestly, in day to day usage, are you applying source patches from other users (the community) to fix bugs, or are you downloading an update via `apt-get`, `pacman` or `yum` (the company supplying the distro)? There's this pervasive false sense of security that comes with open source that just because something open source, it means that it is constantly being audited and checked for bugs. [But this isn't always the case.](https://arstechnica.com/security/2014/04/critical-crypto-bug-in-openssl-opens-two-thirds-of-the-web-to-eavesdropping/). What bugs do you think Windows or Mac users are constantly running into that Linux users aren't?

Also, community size isn't everything. If I want to install an open source OS on a server and leave it running for years with minimal maintenance, I'm probably going to pick one of the BSDs over Linux. Difference communities have different strengths, and I've always found BSDs to be super reliable. Linux is much more pervasive (on multiple architectures and in different forms like Android) and accessible. Having a large community doesn't make bugs harder to type, or change developer interest from something shiny, new and cool to something more boring but important. 

> So, people who have a balance in their savings account should dictate monetary policies?

I never implied anything like that large of a leap, and that's a pretty silly analogy. No, having money in a savings account shouldn't mean that you're able to dictate the money supply. Credit unions would have been a much more balanced analogy for what we're talking about. Running a node doesn't dictate policy, there would have to be many more nodes running the same rules for there to be a real impact.

And yes, in my analogy I think it would be perfectly reasonable for members of a credit union to have some say into whether or not the credit union builds a bigger vault or builds a toolshed for excess storage. One needn't be an expert in banking or vault construction to recognize the risks and costs of each option.

> ""We"" as in the collective ""We"", should the btc community allow one company, be it Blockstream or Bitmain to have absolute control over the network? My position is that no, we should not.

Amen to that.
