"It’s more expensive to convert your fiat to crypto paying exchange commission and possibly fiat-deposit fees and crypto-withdrawal fees on some exchanges, then find a merchant that accepts crypto (possibly passing up cheaper ones that don’t), pay mining fees, and then you have to worry about figuring out your capital gain/losses in the process.

Or you could just give the merchant your fiat directly, having a wide selection if merchants too.

If you guys can efficiently buy bitcoin and solve all this and/or are willing to take the losses to promote the use of crypto, fine, good on you.

"Someone better tell all the people who were defrauded by banks like Wells Fargo that, or had their homes foreclosed on in a predatory process during the housing collapse.  Or those people who can barely function because they have literally only one utility option.  Or the people who have barely functioning internet for outrageous prices because their ISP is allowed to hold a monopoly. 

How about all the people living next to, or in, superfund sites because people were so worried the EPA might regulate something that they forgot to check to make sure some local business wasn't literally abandoning 2 million pounds of rotting explosives under their home? (And when it went off, it could be felt across 4 states -- but its okay, because freedom).  Or the people whose water is now unpotable due to drilling efforts, or their yard is forming sink holes for the same reason?

Lest we forget, the neverending cycle of drug reformulation that allows pharmaceuticals to prevent competing drugs and generics from *ever* reaching the market, or getting them pulled from the market if they are already there, and price hikes that are incompatible with life for the majority of customers?  

Oh the hundreds of housing companies that popped up and literally bought entire housing districts during the collapse for pennies on the dollar, so they can rent the houses out to desperate people for well above market price because there is literally no option? (Because they own all the homes.)

How about predatory, one-sided contracts?  You know, the ones employers try to make you sign that ask you to sign away all of your rights without the ability to sue later in order to just have a job.   ""Go somewhere else"" isn't exactly an option once such tactics become industry standard.

"Yes, and this was exactly what I meant. It is easy to convince people of countries where things are not stable that ""banks are evil"", but in the U.S. that's a stupid approach, because all that does is alienate the listener and make them think that you're some crazy conspiracy theorist.

In the U.S., there are many other better angles to sell Bitcoin to regular Joe than trying to convince them banks are evil. It's the last country in the world where that tactic would work, since most fiat money in the world are pegged to USD.

In fact, I even think that one day banks may even blend themselves into the Bitcoin economy and function as a transparent guard of the technology. Everything bad about money starts from the fact that it's not transparent and the government can print money on their own. If everything becomes transparent, governments and banks won't be able to do that easily because everything is visible on the blockchain.";8;0;False;edoera;dxf47gn;Amazing how people suddenly realize they don’t own their data on Facebook.

"If you're truly interested in this topic, I recommend you graduate from listening only to people like Andreas and other cryptocelebrities and really study economics as a whole, from classical to keynesian to austrian. They all have their own valid points, and none of them have been proven to be absolutely wrong. Some may have opinions (I hate keynesian economics, for example) but that's just an opinion, and nobody knows for sure what is the absolute truth. That's the whole point of science. People come up with different theories. Some of them work for certain cases and some other theories work better for interpreting certain other phenomena in the world. That's why we have Newtonian physics but also Einstein's relativity theory, and also quantum physics.

The point I'm trying to make is that most people in the community seem to make decisions based on what they heard from other ""crypto celebrities"" and automatically make decisions on what is good and what is bad. This is antithesis to the whole mantra of ""do your own research and make your own informed decision"".

Studying the entire ""economics"" may sound overwhelming but it's not that hard nowadays if you really put your mind to it, just go read a comprehensive book about history of the world, history of money, economic theories, or even watch some youtube video series on these topics. That will open your mind.

p.s.

I am a Bitcoiner and I'm not coming from a Bitcoin skeptic point of view. I'm probably one of the most libertarian people you'll ever meet in your life (Most so called libertarians are fake IMO because they base their libertarianism on their limited knowledge of the world). Overall, I have exactly the same goal as you. Just trying to share my own experience, it feels much much better knowing the entire picture than only hearing a filtered version through ""cryptocelebrities"". Also based on what I hear a lot of them say online, I'm pretty sure not all of them have the complete picture of everything, so many things they say can be misleading.

There's a difference between worst case scenario and everyday scenario. If you try to convince regular joe that ""banks are thieves"", that won't work because there's no alternative. For them it's working just fine. Actually even for myself who knows EVERYTHING about how money works all the way from the top level to the bottom fractional reserve banking system, I still use banks.

"The difference is that Facebook takes your private info and monetizes it, whereas banks take your money and monetizes it. Huge difference.

Banks are legally responsible for taking care of your money, so even if you don't ""own"" your own money when you save it to bank, that doesn't really matter, because banks have obligation to pay back to you. Compare that to Facebook situation where you have nothing to win against Facebook if you sue them because it's all in their TOS that they will use your data for their profit.

It's a completely different issue and I think it's important not to conflate the two if we want Bitcoin to really win.

Even if I know I don't own my money when I save it to my bank, I still use them because they're guarding my money, and it works well enough mostly.

Too many self-proclaimed libertarians don't truly understand why we have banks and governments and just mindlessly blame them, and I think that's very counter-productive thing to do.

"not sure what makes me a troll here, just because i question the bcache propaganda? but thank you (anyways) for being open to have normal discussions. 

it took me a minute to setup eclair wallet. the UE is basically the same as with bitcoin.com, or any other wallet for that matter. though i really think bitcoin.com sacrifices a lot of security by not forcing users to backup their seed. this will result in newbies loosing coins. great way of pushing adoption of your coin, frustrating users...  

so how exactly was the possibility of 0-conf removed from bitcoin? nobody will stop you from accepting 0-conf tx. but honestly, would you accept 0-conf payments for anything higher than 50$ on a regular basis? sounds like a bad business decision to make. 

what do you mean LN is not sending real bitcoin? what was i using to fund my channel? to use your words: i have an on-chain bitcoin transaction hash. one time on-chain now enables me to do as many tx i like to pay for small services online, instantly and trustless. ONE on-chain tx, even if that would cost me 35$ once (it didn't, i paid 3sat/byte to get included into the next block), i'd do it as it gives me the ability to forever transact at the cost of single satoshis per tx. why would i want to settle more often than let's say once a year? 

compared to that, BCH tx will look slow and expensive. other coins that implement LN will be able to do cross-chain atomic swaps, eliminating the need to use centralized KYC/AML exchanges to trade. bcache users will be left with these institutions or even more shady options. 

seriously, this is the way forward, away from centralized privacy nightmares like tippr and 0-conf insurances, or goddamn bitcoin.com, spying on its users. 

yes, there will be huge LN nodes with many channels. these will be real businesses with big userbases. of course you don't need such things if nobody uses your coin. 

how far would the internet have gone if infrastructure development had stopped at the base-layer, if all communication would have remained broadcast? what do you think would have happened if the solution to bigger demand of bandwidth would simply have been: add more copper.

"Agreed.  I'm all for BCH existing and competing with BTC, but you are absolutely right.  The wallet should work equally well for users who know nothing about the Bitcoin civil war.  If you use words like ""Bitcoin"" by itself full well knowing that other people use it to mean something different than you mean it, you are just intentionally harming users.  Software should work and be intuitive for ALL users, even those you disagree with.  Say ""Bitcoin Cash"" and ""Bitcoin Core"" if you want.  But knowingly misleading users for your own political semantics is a shitty thing to do.

(Disclaimer:  I haven't used the wallet and don't know or claim that it's doing this -- I'm merely pointing out the error in logic of a user above, claiming that a wallet calling Bitcoin Cash just ""Bitcoin"" isn't malicious or harmful to users.  I'm all for BCH trying to take the name -- it has just as much right to the Bitcoin brand name as Bitcoin Core or Litecoin or Dogecoin has to it.... but when you're making software, your goal should be to make the user's life better, not to confuse them.)

"If simplicity is the shortest route to the desired task and evidence indicates that the majority of users expect to use a ""bitcoin"" wallet for BTC then this has in fact added complexity for most users.

"Context is important. I would venture that he's not talking about complex interfaces like for a CAD program, but lower level things like doors. Lots of doors have poor ""interfaces"" in that they're meant to be pushed, but they have a handle on them you can pull. Adding a label that says ""push"" is a poor solution to the interface, but removing the handle and simply having a push plate makes it so that no one will attempt to use the door incorrectly since it doesn't provide that option.

I see lots of software that's poorly implemented from this perspective. Sometimes it's simple things like when a prompt asks ""yes"" or ""no"", and the most likely answer is yes, but it's on the left. Call me pedantic if you will, but people read from left to right, so if you expect them to say yes, don't make them re-read the button.";2;0;False;Nickolai1989;dxe1utq;"""A user interface should be so simple that a beginner in an emergency can understand it within ten seconds."" - Ted Nelson";8c9man;https://twitter.com/CodeWisdom/status/985193225932689409

"You're a known troll, but I'll respond once anyways:

The total time to send BCH was less than one minute, 10 seconds of that to send, after the other 50 seconds were spent downloading the bitcoin.com app. The transaction went though instantly with 0-conf, something Core removed (to make BTC worse?).

Try doing that with the Lightning Network. It would take hours/days to get a new user setup with a full node, then that user would need to connect to a centralized hub. Your LN IOU would artificially send in 1 second, but it's just an IOU, it's not real Bitcoin. That user wouldn't be able to see that transaction on a blockchain anywhere, it's not final until settled. I have an on-chain BCH transaction hash, you don't. 

When people actually start using BTC/BitcoinCore the on-chain settlement ends up costing $35-50 or more. You can thank the shitty BitcoinCore developers and their 1mb floppy disk blocksize for that.

I didn't send my friend an IOU, I sent him verifiable Bitcoins (BCH). My friend would not have been interested in BitcoinCore or the long and confusing setup, but right now he's a Bitcoin Cash user. Millions of new users will be too confused with the LN to use it. They will become Bitcoin Cash users.";3;1;False;Annapurna317;dxelmuu;"""A user interface should be so simple that a beginner in an emergency can understand it within ten seconds."" - Ted Nelson";8c9man;https://twitter.com/CodeWisdom/status/985193225932689409
