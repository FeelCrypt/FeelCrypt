"Because you clearly don't know what ""with prejudice"" means in a legal sense.

And like I also said, **you probably have never even read the court document.** So why are you here commenting like you know what it says?

It very clearly says that the charges are being withdrawn because Ross was convicted and sentenced to life, and has exhausted all appeals, so it does not make sense to continue with the trial, as he has zero chance of ever going free.

**They even waited till he exhausted all appeals before withdrawing.**

https://freeross.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Doc_14_Dismissal_Indictment_7-26-2018.pdf

Since don't seem to be a fan of reading, it says that the District Attorney in Maryland is choosing to withdraw their charges as another district has affirmed his life sentence. 

""With prejudice"" only means that the Attorneys for Maryland don't plan to ever bring the same charges about. (Because of the affirmed life sentence).

>In a statement to News.Bitcoin.com, United States Attorney for the District of Maryland Robert K. Hur explained his reasoning, “Mr. Ulbricht’s conviction and life sentence in the case handled by the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York have been affirmed BY the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and the Supreme Court has declined to hear the case. We have dismissed the federal charges based on the same conduct pending against Mr. Ulbricht in Maryland, which allows us to direct our resources to other cases where justice has not yet been served.”";3;1;False;You_Gullible_Sheep2;fcuriek;These men are serving life without parole in max security prison for nonviolent drug offenses.

"DPR 100% paid for a hit.

The payment is on the fucking blockchain you knob.

You seem to think Ross's defense was that DPR didn't do any of these things. There is plenty of evidence that DPR did everything that was accused. **There is evidence on the blockchain ffs**.

Ross's defense was in denying he was DPR.

So either you believe Ross, and that DPR did these things, but Ross wasn't DPR. In which case Ross didn't play a role in bringing crypto adoption, and everyone here is dick riding a low level drug dealer.

Or you believe that Ross IS DPR, and did all the nasty shit Ross said DPR did, and you are dick riding someone who tried to pay to have people killed.

Either way, if you are a Ross supporter, you're a piece of shit. Because either you are a fool and dickriding a low level drug dealer nobody. Or you piece of shit for supporting someone who paid for murder simply because you think it will increase your holdings.

There is plenty of reason to think they did, but no proof either way IIUC. The main point is that the prosecutors never felt they had enough hard evidence to prosecute Ross for that, so they did not charge him with it, and that young man is going to spend the rest of his life in maximum security prison for building a web-site that enabled people to buy-sell drugs from each other.  I truly do not understand why some people say he got what he deserved.  I don't think *anybody* deserves to rot in prison for buying/selling drugs or for maintaining a web-site where people can do that.

"None of that is substantiated with actual proof.

Nothing. 

If all of these other people had access to the DPR account, where is the actual proof?

People watched the account, there were logs, records. No evidence of people other than Ross being DPR or using the DPR account. The login while he was in jail was the government accessing his account. If there is all of these other people out there who ""are DPR"", then why didn't they exonerate him by signing in? His entire defense could have been true they signed into the account, or had any records signing into the account. 

The interview that DPR gave saying he took over, came 3 months after he was extorted and scammed, and murder for hire plot. He was likely distancing himself from those actions. Muddy the waters.

BUT. In that interview DPR states: 

""I control the important Silk Road assets. **Only I have access to the private keys corresponding to the Silk Road and forum URLs for example as well as my public PGP key.** This ensures that when you see a signed message from me, or visit silkroadvb5piz3r.onion, you know you can trust it's from me. **I'm also the only one with access to the wallets that back the accounts and escrow on Silk Road,** so there is no possibility of a rogue member of my team running off with the funds.""

And when the government had their SR plant, Cirrus, message the DPR account, asking the person on the DPR  account to log in to the back end, **Guess what happened?**

**They arrested Ross fucking Ulbricht in a library logged in as DPR.**

How about any record at all to support any of this? Plenty of chat logs, server logs, blockchain transactions that all point to Ross. Do you have anything that shows otherwise? Other chatlogs? Other records? Other Tx? Nope.

Ross never deserves to go free. He could have took his millions and left. He chose to not to. That is on him.

You really must be stupid to not connect the dots. His posts before SR are still up on stackoverflow where he doxed himself in the very beginning. You can still go see them. He kept his own records of SR and how he managed it. You can see them. There is tx records on the blockchain that you can go see, that were for murder for hire, as per Ross's own words, which you can read.

All you need to do is read to see what happened, all these ignorant people coming into the crypto space are being used as tools by Ross as a last chance for freedom. Dumb ignorant people defending him because they can't be bothered to read.

">It's like you have no idea what you are talking about whatsoever. But feel entitled to comment.

I've read a lot about this case, but this is more an epistemological question. I am pointing out that all evidence that is digital can be [fake unless independently verified](https://freeross.org/mishandling-critical-evidence/).

> He was arrested in a PUBLIC library. 

I'm not denying that Ross was arrested and imprisoned wrongfully. I'm saying that he could have been logged into Facebook for all we know. All the evidence from that day comes from the DEA, who have already been proven to have [manipulated evidence](https://freeross.org/evidence-deleted/) for the case.

>How about any record at all to support any of this? Plenty of chat logs, server logs, blockchain transactions that all point to Ross. Do you have anything that shows otherwise? Other chatlogs? Other records? Other Tx? Nope. 

All of the [digital evidence is tainted](https://freeross.org/mishandling-critical-evidence/). I can easily create a fake chat between two people and choose a random blockchain transaction and say it was related to a hit.

There is a ton of evidence that supports what I'm saying:

Check [this](https://freeross.org/proof-of-multiple-dprs/) out - a failed handshake between DPR and another guy - basically proof there were two DPRs:

>**A Silk Road employee, Andrew Jones, told federal prosecutors that, in October 2012, he and DPR had agreed upon a “handshake,” a unique question and response that only they would know. If Jones ever doubted he was talking to the same DPR, he could ask the secret question to determine if DPR knew the response.**  
>  
>**Just weeks before Ross was arrested, Jones asked DPR for a book recommendation (the question). DPR should have known the correct response (anything by Rothbard), but was unable to provide it.** 

&#x200B;

> Ross never deserves to go free. He could have took his millions and left. He chose to not to. That is on him. 

You're hating the player and not the game? The rules are rigged - it doesn't change the fact that the drug war shouldn't even exist. It shouldn't even be a crime to sell drugs. Ross should instead be as rich as Jeff Bezos and lauded as a great businessman.

Someone (possibly Ross) was very wealthy from the Silk Road and he never spent it as far as we know. Ross lived with 4 roommates under a fake name, and didn't even have a car. Ross is a hero! Let him free to get a second chance at life. He's so brilliant that he will probably invent another amazing company.

"Given the timing of everything, it seems more likely the agents were posing as DPR during the supposed hitman BS.  I can't think of any other reason it wouldn't have been allowed and used in trial.  You need to listen to the Green interview to learn more about that side of things.

Honestly I'm not so sure.  IMO it would be ok to pose as hitmen if the focus of your investigation is murder for hire, and if you then gain sufficient evidence to prosecute and convict the suspect for that crime.  In this case they did not even prosecute him for that.  Instead they prosecuted him for running a web-site, letting off all of the others who maintained that site (including others who used the DPR moniker as well as Ross) with minimal sentences while throwing the book at Ross and jailing him for life.

I would be willing to bet the corrupt agents will not be prosecuted for anything other than what they already have (and they effectively only got a slap on the wrist for what they did, trying to steal the Bitcoin from Ross/Silk Road during their investigation).  What they did IMO is as bad or worse than what Ross was doing, but there is no way the government will attempt to hold them truly accountable, because it makes the government look bad.  Instead they used them and others who ran Silk Road to testify against Ross and put him away for life without any possibility of parole IIUC.

"Dread Pirate Roberts was a character from the Princess Bride who was bequeathed to different captains over time. That was the whole point of naming the admin DPR on Silk Road.

Directly from [here](https://freeross.org/proof-of-multiple-dprs/):

1. DPR Logged In While Ross was in prison
2. DPR’s Forbes Interview where he says he took over from a previous owner
3. Curtis Green says he was DPR at one point
4. Mark Karpeles likely ran the Silk Road wiki due to using the same technology stack as his other sites. He likely [operated silkroadmarket.org in the early days](https://freeross.org/real-untold-story/).

DPR was likely created by Mark Karpeles and Ashley Barr. And no, they should not go to jail either. Nobody from Silk Road should go to jail because none of them did anything wrong morally! Selling drugs voluntarily is always morally justified.

>**In mid-2013, Karpeles was in contact with at least one of the corrupt agents investigating Silk Road. In a meeting with federal prosecutors, his lawyers provided the name of someone else to target as DPR instead of Karpeles, in exchange for legal immunity.**[**\[14\]**](https://freeross.org/proof-of-multiple-dprs/#14) **Not long after, Ross was arrested. Ten days before the arrest, Der-Yeghiayan sent an email to his boss worrying about “the other two admins getting away.”**[**\[15\]**](https://freeross.org/proof-of-multiple-dprs/#15) **He later wrote that Karpeles was “purging everything after \[Ross’s\] arrest.**";6;1;False;juliushenkin;fcv53do;These men are serving life without parole in max security prison for nonviolent drug offenses.

"When FBI arrested him they did it in such a way that his laptop was on and unencrypted while chatting with an informant on silk road (staged an argument and snatched his laptop before he could close it). On the laptop, they found a detailed daily diary of his running the silk road for the past 2 years. They also had internal chat logs from seizing the silk road servers. Those logs show him discussing having 1 guy tortured and murdered who didn't actually steal anything, he was arrested by corrupt DEA agents and they were the ones who stole from silk road using the arrested guy's account. The DEA agent also was the one Ross contacted to place the torture murder (Ross has a last minute change about the torture part, but it was too late by then). Chat logs all matched up on servers and his laptop, plus his diary account of it. Months later he ordered another torture murder on 5 Canadians, actually just 1, but he was living with 4 other people and was told by hitmen they had to murder all of them to get to him. The FBI thinks that those people never existed and it was just Ross being played by someone who made up a story to get the hitman money.

All these chat logs matched up to his personal laptop, and his personal diary entries. Not only that, but he never made an attempt to wash or mix his Bitcoin. All the 130,000 BTC on his laptop were transferred straight from silk road wallets (prosecution brought in a blockchain analyst expert to prove this). Also the hitman transactions came directly from his laptop wallet. He originally tried to say that all those BTC came from his successful trading, but he dropped that argument as soon as the blockchain expert proved him wrong.

That's the evidence provided. A lot of people are saying all the evidence was rigged by the FBI. Okay, that's a possibility. But you can't rig Bitcoin blockchain transactions. Specifically straight from silk road wallets to his personal laptop wallet, and laptop wallet to hitman payments. These were early Bitcoin days, but that 130k BTC was still worth tens of millions, and also all of silk road's profits over two years. I'm pretty sure if someone set him up (as his family claims), they wouldn't give him the entirety of silk road's earnings.

For sources, Mark Karpeles bought and hosted the trial transcripts. I'm not sure where to find them, but I'm sure someone knows. Mark paid for and hosted the transcripts because Ross early in the trial accused Mark as being DPR (Dread Pirate Roberts).

---

Edit: I think Mark took down the trial transcripts, or at least the links to them. But they're hosted elsewhere on the web, scattered around different places:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2tat9d/silk_road_trial_transcript_day_6/

As a side note, it's pretty cool to see people in r/bitcoin back then using changetip to crowdfund the trial transcripts. You won't see that anymore since BTC has turned into a ""digital gold store of value not to be spent like currency becuase that's a stupid idea.""

Youve clearly never read any of the evidence, your just a stupid kid with a hard on for Ross because he used bitcoin.
