A majority is the greater part, or more than half, of the total. It is a subset of a set consisting of more than half of the set's elements.

Deception takes many forms too. I've never seen Maxwell give a straight answer to anything. 

Furthermore how is it not malicious to prevent the scaling of the most important financial and social invention in 500 years in favor of a hypothetical protocol that requires a hitherto unsolvable CS problem to be solved? If he thought he was smarter than Satoshi he should have done his own thing like so many others have done with alts. But instead he wormed his way into commit access (and who really knows how that happened given Gavin and his children were being threatened during this time) and used the bitcoin brand for his own personal reward.

"Maybe you may not know it, but when the market attracts demand because of low wages, the increase in demand stimulates improvement in working conditions (including wages).

Asking for ""fair wages"" (that is, ""fair prices"", the same concept defended by socialists who make scarce products, creates bachaqueo and has raised the interest rates charged by people who change debt for cash) rejecting the demand attracted by low wages simply extends our ordeal. On the other hand, the fixing of ""minimum wages"" to the only ones that benefit is those who already have a job and who produce enough not to be dismissed. Those that produce less than the minimum price set unilaterally (by the State or collectively) are automatically excluded ... so ""minimum wages"" stimulate unemployment and raise barriers to entry.

By the way, a Venezuelan tells you that he also wants better salaries for Venezuelans, but that they are the result of effort, of nature and of not fighting against the market economy (that is, the abandonment of socialist philosophy).

"Hi ya'll. I work for WooCommerce and want to make sure I clarify a few things. I can easily provide proof if needed.

1. WooCommerce is free and open source. This allows for an open and diverse community to create plugins for free and distribute it as they wish. The plugin mentioned in the article is a third-party plugin and is in no way associated officially with WooCommerce.
2. While I fully support the development of plugins that allow for more payment gateways, this is not unique. A quick search on WordPress.org will come up with many that do the same for a variety of cryptocurrencies.
3. There are millions of WooCommerce stores, not 380,000. Source: builtwith.com

"Not spiteful or inaccurate. 

How many WooCommerce plugins have you written? You have to go through an approval process to be listed on https://woocommerce.com/product-category/woocommerce-extensions/. WooCommerce didn't write this, and whoever is, isn't going to get approved. WooCommerce isn't ""supporting"" BCH. On the other hand, anyone can write an extension and have it listed on the Wordpress plugin directory - that's why there's so many 1 star plugins there. 

So what does this mean? WooCommerce isn't ""bringing"" the plugin to anyone. They aren't marketing it to those stores. None of those stores will see it in the primary extension store. If they are digging around and searching, they may find it on the plugin directory, along with the other 54,000 or so plugins they can find there to do other things (as opposed to the 300 well-curated extensions that WooCommerce officially supports)

It's possible to run a check every time a server request is made, but if the site isn't getting traffic then the transaction wouldn't confirm.

It links to the Reddit post made yesterday, the post I replied to saying ""that's awesome"", and I tipped the person. I did that because I hope the plugin does actually happen and it's something I'd use and find helpful. But they've published a news article based on a Reddit post as proof?

Sorry to be a party pooper, but some of the reaction to this post is that BCH should be mooning. Sorry but not on the back of this news. Woocommerce is a big project yes, but it's open source on the main, so there are lots and lots of Woo plugins out there. This plugin will be made by a third party developer and may not even make it's way on to the official Woo extensions page. Then, a shop owner is only going to choose to download the BCH plugin, if they've heard of it. And let's be honest with ourselves, how many shops do you know that take BCH? It won't come as standard like the PayPal plugin does.

As I say though, if the plugin does actually exist, or is being built, I wish the developer all the best and it will be useful.";17;1;False;CryptoWithFries;dt069ln;WooCommerce brings Bitcoin Cash (BCH) to its 380,000 online retailers.;7rur1l;https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/01/20/woocommerce-store-owners-will-soon-get-another-plugin-accept-bitcoin-cash/
This is a little misleading for people that don’t understand woo-commerce. Someone just wrote a plugin on a platform that supports crypto plugins for checkout, nothing that hasn’t been done before by other cryptos. I’ve written a few for alternative means of payments myself. Has very little impact. It’s really just a step. Woocommerce shops vary a lot by popularity and the fast majority of those stores do little to nothing.
