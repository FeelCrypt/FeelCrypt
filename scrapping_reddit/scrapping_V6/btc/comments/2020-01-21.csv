From there if you don't know the Wallet ID get a reminder email sent. Armed with the Wallet ID and password wallet access should be restored via the website.

I think there are totally ways that the Cash Register app could be set up to integrate with things like Square's inventory tracking, receipt tracking, etc, or maybe even adding a button in the square app that can pop up a QR code for the Bitcoin Cash Register app.

"If the medications are not illegal the answer is yes it's completely legal to do this in the United States. Bitcoin is 100% legal, including holding, buying/selling, and trading for goods and services (both on and offline).

That being said there is some legal junk surrounding the classification of Bitcoin (all ""virtual currency""), in terms of taxes. The IRS classifies virtual currencies like Bitcoin as property. To understand your situation, imagine you wanted to by some Tylenol aspirin from a website, which is perfectly legal. However, you had no money but only a lamp. Fortunately the website operators lived down the street and said they would gladly take your lamp in trade for the bottle of aspirin. Would this be legal? Yes, of course it would. That's called barter. Technically the government says you're required to document the fair value of the lamp and fair value of the aspirin and calculate how much of a gain or loss, in terms of dollars, you made, then include this information with your tax forms come tax time.

That would be the 100% legal way to do it, but would most bother? Probably not. After all, how would the government even know about the trade? So I believe it would be safe to make a one time trade without bothering. The more such trades done, however, would increase the risk of negative consequences for not providing proper documentation.

You dare calling this author a ""morron"" when you can't even spell the word? 🤣

> Lightning MUST run nodes to connect to the network in order to transact, while in Bitcoin Cash only miners must run nodes, users are not burdened with having to run a node.

> It's comparing apples to oranges. 

We can agree on the bad comparison, because both parties on LN have to be online for a transaction to finalize (in the current mainnet implementations at least, there is [work done to be able to initiate a payment to an offline party](https://decrypt.co/10655/lightning-rod-offline-payments-bitcoin-lightning-network)). It's also worth noting that people are currently running LN nodes fairly easily on their smartphones, so the burden is relatively low.

But your point in favor of BCH is not really accurate, you do need to connect to a BCH node to broadcast your transaction (even with a SPV wallet), and if ""only miners"" were to nodes on BCH like you suggest you'd have a network centralized around their interests only.

That shouldn't be a goal if you care about decentralization, and making it difficult to run nodes (a ""burden"") is how you end up with a network with ""only miners"", because they are the only ones who will recoup the costs of running nodes at some point (which depend on the minimum requirements they set, for example, with the block size rule they enforce).

Actually even Satoshi advocated against this exclusion of non-mining nodes in their whitepaper:

> Businesses that receive frequent payments will probably still want to run their own nodes for more independent security and quicker verification.

Because verifying yourself (trustlessly) transactions you receive is not a ""burden"" as you suggest, it's the whole point of verifiable sound money.

How do you even know which chain you're actually transacting on from your light node? How do you know which rules are enforced on it? How do you know if the supply of your currency is still limited? All of this without being able to make those verification trustlessly by yourself...

Are you going to trust third parties for this? Doesn't sound very ""Bitcoiny"" to me. Oh yes... you'll just trust a couple of random ""only mining"" nodes, which now are the only ones verifying rules and share exactly the same set of interests... some of which can now include lying to you about all of this if they can and it's profitable for them (simple game theory).";-3;0;False;diradder;ff6vzg6;Microsoft: On-Chain Scaling 'Degrades Decentralization';ervns0;https://bitcoinist.com/farewell-bitcoin-cash-microsoft-chain-scaling-degrades-decentralization/

Lightning users do not need to become routing nodes to use the LN network. You can check https://github.com/ACINQ/eclair-wallet/wiki/FAQ and find that *""Mobile nodes (and more generally terminal nodes that don't relay payments)* **are not public and will not be found by LN explorers**. *Other nodes won't have them in their routing table and won't display information about them.""*";-3;1;False;ssvb1;ff7br4d;Microsoft: On-Chain Scaling 'Degrades Decentralization';ervns0;https://bitcoinist.com/farewell-bitcoin-cash-microsoft-chain-scaling-degrades-decentralization/
"You undermine your whole credibility when you make apples to oranges comparisons. Also mobile wallets still act as nodes just with different times of activation. When a mobile LN wallet transacts it transacts with the same protocol that an LN nodes. Only notable differences are possibly lock times to make up for the mobile experience and shortcomings.

For an author to make a node count comparison between 2 completely different models of usage, in this case, requiring a node to transact versus node usage being 100% optional is baseline bad research and of course writing that makes invalid conclusions.

It's likely you just don't understand the importance of what I just said so I'll give an easy to digest analogy: *Imagine someone saying with 100% confidence and conviction and promoting information that a dog most certainly requires batteries to function as an animal.

If there is a pressure from new users who want to send, the fee will rise just enough to discourage them (or push a current user out). Don't you think it is a serious problem?

">I still cannot understand why miners did not change to XT or Classic in 2016/2017 once this became obvious.

I think a big reason is that Blockstream literally sent Adam and his dipshit brigade to China and lied to the miners to stay with Core, similar to how XT was an ""altcoin"" and made bannable to mention it on /bitcoin one day.

">As I said, it would be abused by folks like OP in the same way they abuse very clear twitter posts to mean something entirely else. Any good that would come from opening the mod logs would be eclipsed by abusers and liars looking to sensationalize nothing in favor of their false narrative.

So we're choosing between potential abuse by trolls, or the alleged ongoing abuse by mods. Well, given those two views it's no surprise mods are hiding behind fear of the trolls to skirt accountability.

>why is it okay that so many obvious lies and conspiracy theories are promoted here?

Because it's an open place for discussion.  Being (more-or-less) free to have those discussions means that we have to weather all that comes with that freedom.  I'd much rather that than what's occurred in the other sub.

>Why do you insist on changing the subject from the literal post we are in every chance you get?

"Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is a fork of Bitcoin (BTC) that's dedicated to fulfilling Bitcoins original desire to be a peer to peer digital cash system that eliminates counterparty risk.

Specifically the Schism between the various dev teams that make up Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin's controlling development team over a transaction limit built into Bitcoin (BTC)'s code base. BCH folk believe that limit was meant to be a temporary spam limitation based on an overwhelming amount of information confirming that viewpoint. And BTC folk believed that any hard fork (except the ones that have already happened) would open BTC up to irreconcilable attacks. Since then BTC has attempted to scale using complex ""2nd layers"" and soft forks and BCH has successfully scaled using a block size hard fork and continued to add new features to improve BCH's usefulness as an electronic cash system.

Suffice it to say there's a bunch of history there. But if you want to know more about Bitcoin Cash as a currency try [starting here](https://www.bitcoincash.org/start-here.html).

"> For example, make the block-size a moving average of the past X blocks and the next block can be maximum 10% bigger from that average.

It must be median instead of average, so that a single miner can't influence things with arbitrarily chosen block sizes. Also, 10% only seems quite tight.

After the block reward the fees are the only thing keeping the network secure. Miners need to be able to decide which transaction they want to mine.
The vision is, that the network will be efficient enough that miners are enabled to mine low or even zero fee transactions. But if not, your proposal would just mean miners would die off.

The decision was made after determining whats the currently safe trough put (You know people trust the network with their money). There is zero indication that the BCH blocksize will not increase in the future.

Quoting: https://read.cash/@Cheshirecat/abc-dragging-feet-or-existential-choice-1cab28d5

>The reason for this limit is that due to the existing design of the code these chains result in miners having to do a lot of computations when processing these long chains. The computation load is quadratic so these computations get way more difficult with each extra transaction added to the chain. The limit is there to make sure nobody is able to attack the network by making a chain that would be too difficult to compute within a reasonable amount of time. The problem is of course more complicated and others have discussed it in detail elsewhere. Most important is to know that the problem is real and the limit there for a very good reason.

That's why I propose the default is a moving average from the past X blocks, and the next block can deviate like 10% from that default. 

> The decision was made after determining whats the currently safe trough put (You know people trust the network with their money).

It will be much better if we can do away with that trust. At some point we'll have to let the network evolve without the need for forks.

Not my point at all. 

> The limit is there to make sure nobody is able to attack the network by making a chain that would be too difficult to compute within a reasonable amount of time.

Sure. Except if you're running BU and longer chains don't bother. Also if it's year 2050, the computers are way faster and you can sustain longer chains, but it's no longer practical to change the rules just for that.

No.  I'm saying that the data shows that there is little demand for large blocks.  Lots of demand for small blocks and off chain scaling.

>Did you never pay over $3 because you avoided high congestion days ?

I don't recall avoiding them, I broadcasted transactions as I needed.  Since Bitcoin is hardly used for commerce, my transactions, at least back then we're mainly to and from exchanges. I did buy a couple of items though.  One was a laptop for around $2,000, so even a $10 would have been acceptable to me, still cheaper than credit card and PayPal.

>Do you think on boarding new users should have to learn how to goto block congestion websites to learn how to set the proper fees before they should transact with bitcoin ?

Yes, new users should learn how this brand new tech works.  Of course, better fee estimation with wallets will help in this area too. It's important to note that, with L2, confirmation times and fees aren't an issue so long as you can abstract away channel openings and inbound liquidity, although you get that just by spending.

>Just wondering what other terrible UX we can give to people.

Now everyone treats bitcoinABC as the core team for BCH.

Dev-centralized just as in BTC- except bitcoin core doesn't abuse its power - every  recent fork has been activated using signaling which is better than nothing.  

They are more competent because they were smart enough to not strip away the POW consensus layer by implementing automatic block finalization after 11 blocks. ( such immutability- why didn't satoshi think of this lol /s )

"> Limiting their reach is a good thing - arguably it's all of our duty to keep a constant check on the scope of our governments.

Inded, but the way to do that is by constraining it through laws that let the people decide who gets to wield the government's powwer, limit their authority, ensure transparency, and provide means to stop and punish their abuses.

In fact, one can say tha the purpose of any law is to constrain the government, not the citizens.  A law that guarantees freedom of vaping for lawful citizens in fact prohibits the government from constraining or punishing vapers. A law that makes it a crime for restaurant patrons to put ketchup on pizza actually obliges the police to arrest anyone who does that, and prohibits the judge from  absolving him.

"> The US dollar already does everything you want. Bitcoin (in your vision) serves no useful purpose that is not already served by the US dollar.

Correct.  Although bitcoin is two things:  a payment system (Satoshi's goal) and a new currency (that he had to create to make the payment system decentralzied).

So, **as a currency**, the US dollar is definitely better than bitcoin (or any crypto).  Indeed, the USD is arguably the best currency in human history, and has been so for over a century.  That is why it is widely used all over the world, not only in the US.  Whereas the bitcoin currency is so volatile that it is completely useless as such. (It is used by criminals only because the miners do not comply with AML/KYC, not for any other reason.)

**As a payment system**, bitcoin should be compared to other payment systems, like cash (paper and coins), bank transfers, credit cards, PayPal, ApplePay, etc.  It beats cash only in that it can do large transactions, and works over the internet whereas cash only works for presential trades.  But it loses to cash in many other aspects, such as speed, simplicity of use, acceptance, total capacity, and even cost and risk.  And bitcoin loses badly to all the other systems, in almost every aspect.  And the loss would be downright laughable, if users had to pay the true cost of the system -- currently close to 50 USD per transaction.";1;0;False;jstolfi;ff6g6hx;"Vin Armani keeps trying to push this idea that you can't ""own"" or ""steal"" bitcoins, and that they're not ""money"".

"> If Bitcoin is 100% fully compliant and enforceable with all government rules and regulations

Bitcoin now is neither beyond government's reach and control, nor 100% compliant with the law.  For the latter, the miners should respect KYC/AML laws: they should know the real identity of all their users, and report to the interpol any transaction above a certain value, or that seems suspicious for some reason. 

That is of course is impossible, so bitcoin (or any crypto) cannot be 100% compliant with the laws; not even close.  (Facebook's Libra called itself ""cryptocurrency"" for marketing purposes, but it would have to be centralized and compliant with KYC/AML laws, as well as with every applicable national financial services regulations, to get permission to operate).

> in what way is Bitcoin different from fiat

Bitcoin **is** a fiat currency, because it was created and is being issued ""by fiat"", without any corresponding reserves of something with more concrete value that could be redeemed with it.

Bitcoiners use ""fiat"" as meaning ""government-issued"", but that is incorrect.  Before bitcoin, the most important fiat currencies were indeed issued by national governments. Private fiat currencies are generally forbidden, because they are basically scams with diffuse victims; but there are occasional attempts to create them, that may be tolerated or ignored by govs -- like the ""Brighton pound"".  

So bitcoin was perhaps the first ""decentralized"" fiat currency -- not issued by a government or a single private institution, but by an open community of private anonymous miners.";1;1;False;jstolfi;ff6ci67;"Vin Armani keeps trying to push this idea that you can't ""own"" or ""steal"" bitcoins, and that they're not ""money"".

"> The only useful function of Bitcoin is to defy government

That was not at all the goal of bitcoin.  It was a goal that cypherpunks slapped onto it, when they discovered it and believed (incorrectly) that it would provide the biggest missing piece in their utopia: a payment system that governments could not monitor, block, or confiscate.  

And, as we have seen, bitcoin is highly unsuited for that purpose.  The FBI actually *loves* bitcoin, because it makes it much easier to identify and catch drug dealers and other criminals -- at least the ones who are stupid enough to use it.

> It seems you believe individuals should not disobey their government.

The idea that people have the ""right"" to ignore laws that they don't agree with makes no logical sense.  laws are meant to apply *specifically* to those who do not agree with them.  

If you think that a law is wrong, based on some higher principles, you should fight to have it changed.  Demaning a tool that would let you violate the law impunely is futile: if the tool did work, the government would *have* to block it, at any cost. 

Until six years ago, I used to have respect for the cypherpunk movement.  I could see only things like Wikileaks, open source, and the fight against abusive copyright laws.  I even had Assange's photo on my home page, and had good hopes for Rick Falkvinge and his Pirate Party.

However, that sympathy has all but evaporated since I started following bitcoin.  I realized that cypherpunks -- at least those who are into crypto, including Rick -- don't really care about those human rights and social justice causes; they only use them as excuses. It seems that when cypherpunks say ""freedom"", what they really mean is ""the ability to buy or sell drugs online without being caught by the police"", nothing more.   Their real heroes are not Aaron Schwartz and Assange, but Ross Ulbricht and Charlie Shrem.

"By ""game"" you mean the investment ponzi, I presume.

Bitcoin was not supposed to be a ""game"".  It was supposed to be a decentralized payment system.  It had several fatal flaws, not technical but in the economy and usability.  For one thing, the economics of mining inevitably led to concentration of the total hashpower in half a dozen pools (some possibly with same owners) -- that is, it did not, and could not, remain decentralized.

As for the ""infinite game"", every pyramid scheme is based on the implicit assumption that it will continue forever.  But all pyramid or ponzi schemes must eventually collapse, because they will inevitably run out of suckers with money.  

The same applies to bitcoin: it is mathematically guaranteed that will collapse eventually.  

But that is not why investing in bitcoin is a bad idea.  Investors will not lose anything when it collapses.  As in any pyramid or ponzi scheme, they lose when they invest, and the people running the system (miners, in this case) pocket a large slice of that money.   Bitcoin investors as a whole already lost 15 billion USD so far.  They will never get that money back, and that loss can only increase, never decerase.

"""Possession"" of a thing is effectively having control over it.  ""Property"" (""ownership"") is having the *right* to possession.  

If your car is stolen, the thief will have possession, but it is still your property; you still own it.

In the real world,  property requires a government:  you own something if the state agrees that you own it, and is supposed to use its powers to ensure that you have possession of it.  For example, if someone takes your property, the state is supposed to find and punish the thief, and return the thing to you.

The state decides who has property of what based on a bunch of laws that regulate trade, creation, inheritance, rewards, etc.   You have property of something if you followed those laws, and can prove that to the state. 

The big unsolved problem for anarchists is how to define property, if there were no state.  They try to use ""non-aggression"" as the criterion, but that is baloney.  People will disagree all the time on who should have property of something, even with no aggression involved, even in good faith.  Deciding those disputes is why civil courts exist.  

If you leave your car unlocked with the key in the ignition, and someone else drives away with it -- where is the aggression?  

And even if you could define ""property"" without a state, what would be the point?

"**Disclaimer and Explanation**

1) Sorry for that probably being the worst screenshot you've ever seen. 


2) I'm not trying to sow discord, I have genuine concerns that these ideas might hurt our message of p2p cash. I would have kept it on Twitter but he blocked me, so this is my second choice of addressing them. Let me explain.


3) I don't think what Vin is doing is pragmatic. Is this the idea he really wants to give noobs? That Bitcoin, even though is cash, isn't money? And that bitcoins cant be stolen and therefore can't be rightfully reclaimed if stolen? What's the eventual positive result of this message supposed to be?


4) Given the lack of pragmatism, it's concerning (to me) how much Vin is investing into this idea. He's wrote a book covering it, he's made one or two animated explanations (which he's likely paid others to make) on it, and he's repeatedly making a point of it on places like Twitter. This isn't just some shower thought to tell your nerd friends, this is an idea that Vin is investing real and substantial time, money, and energy into, and he's advertising it to the noobs.


5) I think Vin is logically incorrect. The fallacy is assuming that owning a bitcoin is somehow owning a number. A Bitcoin is an abstract concept, who's value is supposed to be purely subjective. All things that are owned are merely abstract concepts. Owning a chair for example isn't owning a trillion carbon atoms, it's owning the abstract existence of the chair. If I run a current of electricity through your chair and replace the electrons in your chair with new electrons, but I haven't visibly damaged the chair, I didn't ""steal your electrons"", and the chair is still there. Ownership isn't materialistic, it's abstract.


Ownership is defined by peacefully acquiring some resource. As long as your acquisition doesn't generate conflict with another previous owner, then you're morally fine. It would be stealing to try to acquire something that already belonged to someone else though. The starting point of ownership is homesteading unowned resources in nature, and it's carried on through voluntary transactions.";5;1;False;J-Stodd;ff6e1t6;"Vin Armani keeps trying to push this idea that you can't ""own"" or ""steal"" bitcoins, and that they're not ""money"".

Vin's argument ""it's just numbers, therefore not theft"" argument was tried in various forms in Dutch courts and they all failed. You can read more detail in the blog post.

I see Vin wants to achieve a perfect unambiguous definition of societal rules. Law doesn't work like that. There are always imperfections and ambiguities since a lawmaker can never foresee every possible future judicial conflict. There is always some subjective interpretation, typically resolved by having impartial judges.

For a libertarian society, this will be no better. My understanding is that Vin prefers a libertarian society rooted in self-evident rules. But if you have two men write down individually what they think these self-evident rules are, I'm sure you'll find ambiguous edge cases. For example, whether ownership applies to bitcoin.

>However, to address your main beef with his idea, he isn't wrong. You can't own a series of numbers. Utxos and private keys are both series of numbers

**Nobody is saying** you can own private keys or utxos.  You can own the abstract idea of bitcoins, not cryptographic numbers. If I steal a Bitcoin from you, you could steal a different one back from me, and that would make the situation right (because bitcoins are fungible). 

>Also however, you're right, that the receipt of an utxo at a particular date/time by an address associated with a private key, that of which only one particular individual has knowledge, constitutes an ""ownership"".

"I think many premises of American libertarianism are worthwhile topics of discussion and even decent goals in the abstract. States do abuse power. They also grow in scope far beyond their mandate.

"I agree with your sentiment, but we also need to not let people carry bad messages that make the rest of us look bad. 

Imagine you're a libertarian, and you have a fellow libertarian that starts arguing for ""children can consent"" or ""CP should be legalized"". Even if you thought that your fellow libertarian was correct, isn't this horrible advertising that gives people the wrong ideas? This actually happened, a guy named Arvin was a libertarian running for office, and when he did this he lost all his traction and made everyone associated with him look bad.

Usually ideas that sound crazy, are crazy. You've just got to look more into the why before you start proclaiming to the world that you want to fight about it on a hill.

What Vin is doing may not be as extreme, I think it's a similar problem. Telling noobs that Bitcoin isn't money goes against peer to peer electronic **cash**, and telling them that you can't steal it might make them scared that others will take their bitcoins from them. Even if Vin is right, there is no practical reason to be pushing this, it doesn't do anything good. Yet Vin has invested time and money into this idea and is trying to push it very hard. He wrote a book, created an animated explanation or two, and is making many posts in defense of his idea about Bitcoin not being ownable or money. Why?

And I think he's logically wrong too, but instead on engaging with me even a little bit when I expressed my concerns, he blocked me. I'm not taking it personally, but this kind of action concerns me more.

Saying owning Bitcoin is just owning a number is like saying owning a chair is just owning a bunch of carbon atoms, believing either of these can lead to pretty insane conclusions. Nobody is saying you can own a number. You can own a Bitcoin though, which is an abstract idea. Everything is an abstract idea, most things you think to exist in reality probably exist differently than how you think they do. Matter isn't solid, it's over 99.999% empty space and the remainder is pure energy. And when you own a material thing, it isn't even the matter that you own, it's the abstract concept that includes it's observable state of being.

If nobody else owns it, you can come to own it by acquiring it, meaning to possess or alter it in such a way that signifies to others that you likely have future intentions for that resource, and that it's no longer in a state of nature.

Let’s calculate in USD. Say miners now receive 4000$ per block. Let say that about 4,000,000 transactions fit in a block of a Gigabyte, that we can raise the block size to a Gigabyte and that there is demand for 400,000 transactions per minute. In the future the block subsidy will be practically zero. Let’s assume the average fee is 0.001 USD. 4,000,000 times 0.001$ = 4000$. Of course you can calculate with a different fee (one cent, ten cents) and you would need less transactions and smaller blocks. It is clear that usage needs to grow and blocks need to get larger. Both would be possible. Costs for large block may be a little bit higher, but you get the idea.;2;0;False;Htfr;ff5e7d7;As the coinbase reduces via halvenings and with low fees as an ongoing goal, what incentive is there for miners to continue validating the chain in the future?;erntjx;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/erntjx/as_the_coinbase_reduces_via_halvenings_and_with/
"> (myself, lol:)  We see in many other markets that people are willing to pay far more than the marginal cost, and for many reasons.

Of many mechanisms I can think of, there is one that we see in BTC right now. We have some wallets with excellent fee estimation, and if you offer the recommended fee, your transaction is most probably included. But that is the point, there is a small probability that it is not included. So if the fee requirement is regarded, by the transactor, to be low anyway, he is willing to offer a higher fee, only to counter that small risk. Double the required for instance, it depends on the situation of the person who wants to transact, how important it is to him. So one answer is that already, in BTC, people pay more than the required fee, to counter a small risk of delay. So to use this market incitament in BCH, it is a question of introducing a small risk, with a single digit of probability, to delay a transaction for only one block. This can be done without any rule, just small differences in miner thinking can do it. If necessary, it can be done in a voluntary association of some of the miners. (akin to a standards organization, which is somewhat like a cartel, but without the government force).

It is a good question, if you think like me that the fee required for each transaction by the miner, is the marginal cost plus a small profit for the trouble of doing it. It means there is no income for the hashrate. I think there are solutions, that can make the transactors also pay for a part of the hashrate, but not if you think the market is ""effective"" or based on ""animal spirits"".

"Theres a difference in that for cards they are taking the information but not making a charge. A card obviously has a spending limit, but it's probably a lot higher available credit than people would be willing to tie up with their liquid money. 

Taking crypto as a deposit would also require them to send it back. It sounds trivial but that can lead to a lot of time and risk for the hotel(or other business).

What solutions can we come up with that will make crypto competitive for this use case?

A 2-of-3 multisig where the hotel and customer both have the key could work.

Good points and I do think the third party idea could work. I also think it would be interesting if somehow the hotels could earn interest on the crypto while they hold it or maybe they could be allowed by the customer to keep the gains on the crypto while they hold the deposit if in fact the crypto does go up in value. Of course capital gains and other variables would be at play so maybe those two ideas aren’t so good. It might be that a stable coin is really the best option along with a third party like what you mentioned.;3;0;False;TheCryptoCloud;ff4no0r;What do you think it will take for hotels to accept a crypto deposit for incidentals as opposed to a credit card?;ermh18;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/ermh18/what_do_you_think_it_will_take_for_hotels_to/

If it isn’t user friendly than it isn’t p2p. One needs substantial education from a central authority and no such trusted authority exists. 

As a community, the reaction should have been “so sorry you had this experience. We understand crypto is in its early stages and it’s difficult to know all the variables especially for someone that is involved in other ventures and may not have the time to research every known best practice. Let’s help you fix it”

* Targeted attack: An external agent might learn about the owners of recovery and target the weakest points up to the threshold needed to execute attack recovery.
* General exposure: An attacker which manage to infect a large user-base env dependency and get access to several identities could also side effect on unaffected users through recovery.
* Impersonation attack: An targeted attack could learn about a user and impersonate the user to their social peers to execute an attack recovery. This becomes more concerning as AI research was capable of ""deep fakes"" of other persons voice and facial movements.

"Bitcoin Cash is peer to peer electronic cash.

Ethereum is a smart contract and decentralized application platform.  I.e., very interesting, just not peer to peer electronic cash.

BTC and LTC were compromised.  When the creator of LTC dumps all his LTC and ends up on the board of a German bank, who do you think is managing LTC now?  Cancel culture is another telltale sign that bad actors are running the show.  They are deliberately spreading toxicity.  The narrative that someday a replacement network will be ready is another very bad sign.  These people obviously don't want you using bitcoin.  :)

I'm also less interested in Johnny-come-lately or ""me too"" style projects.  Maybe they're great.  I don't know who really is behind them and I'm not interested in doing investigative work.

I want peer to peer electronic cash that I can use today - right now.  I want to be able to spend p2p cash on whatever I need.  BCH is the best suited for this, by far.

Satoshi said it would be raised with a hardfork. Hardforks are not scary, using anyone-can-spend to do ""backwards compatible upgrades"" that are only backwards compatible because the old clients are not verifying the new types of sigs is not good engineering and it's not honest. 

If 1MB is really saving us from a hardware-based limitation, then Segwit solves nothing except to enable such hacky ""backwards compatible"" upgrades, all the bits still have to be sent over the wire and stored. i.e. if Segwit is equivalent to 2MB blocks of throughput, then the hardware can handle a simple 2MB block as easily.

Because it's a useful test for people who claim that people shouldn't focus on CSW. If he really isn't an important aspect of BSV, it should be super easy to state because the evidence is overwhelming.

The rest of the conversation I don't think will go well. Just wanted to answer your question here.

You think so, but I know it doesn't. A BCH transaction gets transmitted and validated one time. A Nano transactions takes 4 stop from original sender to next peer. I had a source direct from your sub I'd have to find it. So right out of the gate it's not the same thing.

"If I had to pick one reason why no other coin has a shot at becoming sound, global money it's because of the coin distribution. Look at who holds the most of each coin. They are the guardians of the project's long-term soundness as money.

For BCH, the biggest active holder is Bitmain. Bitcoin.com is also heavily invested. Satoshi holds more than them, but hasn't moved them since he disappeared. He might not even be alive anymore.

LTC doesn't have any die-hard Libertarian/Austrian economics fans fighting for it. It doesn't really have anyone fighting for it at all, it's just an opportunistic copy/paste that got opportunistically listed early on Coinbase. It's the result of one man riding the tailcoats of greater men, and does not have a unique use case.

ETH isn't trying to be sound money at all. It is a technology platform. Its value as such is undeniable, but it is a different category and is not competing with the bitcoin project (which is multiple, competing chains now).

I don't know much about nano, sorry. But I do know that no new coin can re-create the distribution that the bitcoin project came into the world with. Early adopters were libertarians and people savvy about the Fed and Austrian economics. New coins, in contrast, are adopted by the speculative masses right out of the gates, and have fewer defenders with conviction and understanding of what makes money sound.

"Yes, you are correct.

Basically, the new bill is modifying the United States Tax Code of 1986, which was written before virtual currency existed, to allow for the same personal transaction exemptions that foreign currencies have. The bill references the definition of personal transactions as defined in section 988(e) of the tax code, while making _very clear_ that virtual currencies are **""not otherwise currency under section 988""** and are merely a ""_digital  representation of value that is used as a medium of exchange_"".

In other words, the personal transaction exemption is being granted, but it's still not going to be treated or taxed like a currency.

The specific part of the tax code that's being modified is [Chapter 1, Sub Chapter B, Part III](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/subtitle-A/chapter-1/subchapter-B/part-III). For those wondering, this chapter is about, and is actually titled, _""Items Specifically Excluded From Gross Income""_ 

In essence, they are adding one more thing to the list of things that are excluded from [gross income](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/grossincome.asp) (which includes capital gains). In this case, gains of over $200 during personal transactions.

Here is the full text of what they are excluding:

_""Gross income of an individual  shall not include gain, by reason of changes in exchange rates, from the disposition of virtual currency in a  personal  transaction (as  such  term  is  defined  in  section  10988(e)).The preceding sentence shall not apply if the gain which would otherwise be recognized  on the transaction exceeds $200.""_

The reality is, the bill is a phenomenal step in the right direction, because as it [stands now](https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/er8fu9/proposed_bill_in_us_house_of_representatives_to/ff2azal/), cryptocurrency is practically unusable for people who want to be legal.

I should also note: The bill's sponsor is [Suzanne Delbene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzan_DelBene), who worked for Microsoft for well over a decade and was also CEO of her own company. It seems probable to me that she would be a little more supportive and knowledgeable of cryptocurrencies than the average person.";5;0;False;333929;ff4ek84;New house bill is a trap!

Now If another coin splits off Bitcoin Cash BCH and scales better while still providing the same other features (decentralization, low fees and such) it will provide a challenge just as BCH is challenging BTC now.

They do reflect reality: people here kept supporting those frauds and scams up until it didn't fit their agenda. The few people protesting are systemically swept away by a couple rounds of old trope posts about low fees or some other drama about ""censorship"" or ""vote manipulation"".

Just like it recently happened when Hayden Otto was exposed for lying about BCH usage stats in Australia and suddenly it was all about the so-called vote manipulation instead of the damning evidences presented in the post. And of course it was never really determined who ordered this so-called vote manipulation... but in the end the result is that the actual discussion was avoided, so if we look at the outcome there is a clear winner in this *manipulation* and it's not the people who made the posts.

"I have my doubts.  But one thing I thought of today was to use the congressman's need to raise [congressional dues](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7879613/AOC-holds-250K-dues-Democrats-says-wont-pay-people-like-not-welcome.html) to our favor.  My plan is basically to donate BCH to your congressman.  Works something like this.

1. Find your [congressman](https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative)
2. Ensure your registered to vote since congressmen will pay more attention to a registered voter than an unregistered voter.
3. Join the political party of your congressman.  You don't have to vote party ticket, but party rolls are public record.  Your congressman will pay more attention to a registered voter in their party than one in an opposing party.
4. Use google to find their campaign page, not their Congressional page.  The two are different.
5. Make a $10 donation through their campaign page and record all the answers you gave in the questionnaire.  Be truthful.  Donations are public record and a politician will pay a lot more attention to a donor than a non-donor.
6. Find the mailing address for correspondence off of the campaign web-page for the congressman.
7. [Make a paper wallet](https://github.com/pointbiz/bitaddress.org) depositing $10 in BTC to it.  Ensure you ***KEEP THE PRIVATE KEY***.
8. Write a letter to the congressman making ***NO*** political position, only requesting that they accept your small campaign contribution.  Include in your letter all the questions and answers you filed away in [5] as well as the paper wallet.  Provide some basic instructions for sweeping a paper wallet and mention that the wallet will be void after 12 months.
9. Use the congressman's House.gov website (not the campaign website) to request a meeting with the congressman or his staff.  Yes, they do this, its their job.  Tell them you would like to discuss ""Virtual Currency Tax Fairness Act of 2020"" sponsored by congresswoman Suzan DelBene of Washington's 1st District.
10. You will likely meet with a staff member, don't be offended.  Simply make your case to them and also provide your arguments in written form.  Some offices may require you transcribe the message onto their letterhead.  Don't be offended, just do it.
11. Check the address in the paper wallet every month or so to see if the funds have moved.  If they do move send a letter, tweet or call to the congressman's campaign thanking them for accepting your bitcoin donation.
12. If the funds don't move for 12 months, sweep them back to your wallet and send a letter, tweet, or call to the campaign informing them that the wallet had expired and offer to make them another.  They will decline.

Done.  You've done your bit and it only cost you $10 to $20 and a shit-ton of time.  The above really kinda works for any interaction you want to have with the government.  I've used it before and it helped quite a bit.

"> I'll believe your assessment when it can be demonstrated, not on a teensy test net with a few computers sending blocks back and forth, but on a real one, where blocks need to (propagate) cleanly in just a few seconds, and not crush the node count down below 4 digits. I'm not saying it will never be possible, but it's obviously no where near as possible today (or 10 years ago) as you're suggesting.

It has not happened yet because there is no need. To build out a system with so much excess capacity would be an inefficient use of resources. After the [2018 stress test](https://medium.com/@j_73307/block-propagation-data-from-bitcoin-cashs-stress-test-5b1d7d39a234), I upgraded my node  with a pair of faster disks: because I believe that was the main bottle-neck (my node (Edmonton) was single-core CPU limited + my 250GB disk was almost full). Bitcoin XT development was abandoned in favour of [Flowee the hub]( https://flowee.org/): new node software designed from the ground up to allow parallel transaction validation (with a non-blocking database structure taking advantage of bitcoins append-only nature).

Again, that already happened on BTC with the miners deciding to implement  a soft-fork. Full nodes are as powerless as SPV wallets when a soft-fork happens. The reason is that you need to update your software to learn the new rules.
