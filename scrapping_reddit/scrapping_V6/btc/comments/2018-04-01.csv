"Sinclair Broadcasting, the entity gobbling up every local news station so that they can put a hand up their anchors' asses to make their lips move, is a corporation, which I've been told is distinct from a conspiracy.

Some recent changes enacted by Ajit Pai (yes, *that* Ajit Pai) at the FCC that happened to be very favorable to Sinclair Broadcasting, and that were pushed at the exact time Ajit was chatting with Sinclair, are likely to be instances of regulatory capture, but nowadays regulatory bodies becoming compromised by the very corporations they were meant to regulate is just as American as apple pie, so really, no conspiracy here.

"It's been an ongoing battle by the media to discredit social media with the fake news narrative that has been going on.

Face it, the 2016 election and the hacked emails revealed the systemic corruption by the political insiders and the media to manipulate public opinion. It put tremendous damage on the establishment and the media. The fake news and Russian collusion narrative are the media and the establishment fighting back to regain its control.

Social media has done a net good for politics, by far.

Does social media have its issues? Sure. But the alternative is far worse. Before online social platforms existed, people passively consumed information from a few select sources on television. And it's often tailored to the lowest common denominator. Television treats politics as if it's some reality-show-sports-game, focusing on poll numbers and scandals. The actual issues and policies are pushed to the wayside. If you wanted to do research on your own, you had to go to the library and ask the librarian to dig through cabinets of catalogs to find the information you wanted.

The internet has vastly expanded the political discourse. Yes, that means there is an increase of bad information. But the flip side is also true. People can do research now on unprecedented levels. You could quickly look up facts to confirm it. You could quickly look up a candidate's voting record. The average person could engage in politics instead of just listening to a few pundits on the screen.

The result is that people who engage online have vastly different political views than the ones pushed by the television news outlets. The older generation grew up getting their news from television and they continue to rely on it as their primary news source. The median age of the CNN viewer is 60. Fox and MSNBC is 65. 

And you could see a stark divide in their political opinions compared to those younger than 35. The younger, more engaged generation prefer candidates that speak with substance. It's not surprising when the candidates that are popular on the internet are very different than the ones covered on television. Bernie Sanders had a media blackout yet he is overwhelmingly popular with those younger than 35. 

What's going to happen when the older generation passes away? The establishment will lose their control of public opinion through the corporate media. They will not go without a fight. ";10;2;False;dopadelic;dwm1mm5;This is extremely dangerous to our idiocracy.;88mbxc;https://youtu.be/hWLjYJ4BzvI

This video is probably more relevant to Bitcoin than anything on any crypto sub. This shows how a few people in places like 'media matters' are feeding the talking points to these local stations on both left and right side of the political spectrum, who are just parroting the talking points. This clearly lays out how the powers to be, use their control of mainstream media to push for bigger government, more war, more debt and more inflation through central banking cartels who will reward back the media and politicians. Its a vicious cycle where a handful of kleptocrats are able to control the population. Bitcoin breaks that if it scales adequately to become money for the masses and snatches back the control of money away from the establishment powers.

"You sir, are entitled to your own opinion. I would suggest you do some more research on BCH if you believe the sole difference* in comparison to BTC is only the blocksize.

* I use the word difference because advantage is subjective.

I honestly believe in the best of both worlds. I don’t think blocksize is the sole answer to scalability, nor do I believe off-chain layers are the sole answer. I think a combination of both will have to do the job, in which I think both BCH and BTC communities can agree with. The two communities just differ on the implementation of doing so.

"So... and this is a serious question... does r/bitcoin genuinely believe that businesses will opt to pay high fees and manage lightning channels and do all kinds of other hassles... rather than just using another coin?

I get that Bitcoin wants to not sacrifice security and genuinely believes any blocksize raise will harm security.  Ok fine, so it really is ""digital gold"".

But surely you're not convincing yourselves that people are every going to *use* it for anything besides ""hodling""?

I mean, be honest, do you actually *use* Bitcoin like you used to?  I used to buy stuff with Bitcoin.  You know, support the coin, promote its use, etc.  I can't do that any more without massive headaches or fees.  It's become *harder* to use over time, not easier.  I can no longer promote it as a solution for the poor and unbanked, for easy small internet payments, for.... anything other than being secure digital gold.  And again, I get it, that's a solid use case.  Keeping your money secure is important.  But you do understand why most people are using other coins, right?

"If you read again, I did make a pro BTC point about LN scaling if implemented as planned.

I’m not ‘shilling’ any coin, I call it how I see it, a spade is a spade.

I invite you to explain your ‘Chinese scam coin’ narrative without using bcash/roger/jihan as supporting evidence because the whole”[insert roger/jihan/CSW here] did [xyz] so bcash is a scam” is an invalid argument that has nothing to do with the coding of the Bitcoin Cash protocol.

You do realize that as of right now, Chinese scam coin can perform just-as-fast transactions (even micro-transactions) with sub-cent fees on chain, when compared to LN. Also, with LN you cannot gift someone with cryptocurrency who has yet to adopt the technology.

Also with LN, the majority of fees will be removed from the miners and into LN, this is detrimental to the very foundation of the protocol.

I’ve said it before, I don’t have a problem with people having their own opinions nor do I have an issue with BTC implementing their version of the Bitcoin protocol.

“If you don't believe me or don't get it, I don't have time to try to convince you, sorry” - SN.

Edit: another user had pointed out that the way you can lose your funds if you broadcast an old channel state within LN, this gives economic incentive for the collectors of such funds to promote fraud for their own gain.

"This is exactly what I mean, thank you for being a good (toxic) example.

I am entitled to have an opinion, just like you, its a free world, but you call me a tool for having a different opinion than you. 

I tell you why people like me dont like BCH and dont want to support the coin by holding or buying it. Its purely because of people like Roger Ver and fake satoshi. (ex) criminals, proven liars, paying people to shill, faking newbies into believing that BCH is bitcoin  by abusing the bitcoin.com domain, a btc subreddit and the bitcoin twitter. I am not making this up, these are facts.

Would BCH ever be so big without the support of Roger and the channels he controls? 

Also this sub, so toxic. You guys want bitcoin to die, why would you think that anyone who likes bitcoin would support you guys? Why do you think you can win love and support by doing all those things? How did you ever think this would play out?

The truth is that bch probably will never succeed because of these reasons, we, the **majority** in the cryptocommunity, dislike bch because of this. You dont have to like it, I just want to inform you why people are hostile against bch, its because you are hostile to anyone else who doesn't favor bigger blocks, more centralization, less security etc.

You are entitled on having an opinion about what you think is bitcoin, again its a free world, but I am not a tool for disliking it, I even explain to you why I dislike it. 


Bitcoin does not has such dominant frontmen as BCH, of course there is core, most guys are very cool, some a bit less. Of course there are people like Andreas Antonopoulos who are the face of bitcoin. But its been a while now, most people have choosen what they like most, and you guys just ruined it for people like me who had an interest in both coins, but now only hold the real bitcoin because of people like Roger Ver, fake satoshi, and people like you. 

Why do you think we (the majority) dislike bch? because we are all stupid?
