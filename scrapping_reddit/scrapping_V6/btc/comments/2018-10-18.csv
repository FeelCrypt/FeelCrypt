"I’m loving all the bank apologists posting in this thread. 

Sorry, old-school legacy backwoods finance guys. 

Crypto is coming to eat your lunch, whether you like it or not. Three dollar fees for someone to access their own money, whether it’s their bank or not, will soon be history. 

Picture an international currency that nobody has to trade for a local currency when they travel overseas. Nobody needs permission to get access to it. They can carry as much as they want, anywhere they want.  And they can access it anytime, without anyone’s permission.

Fees to send money anywhere on the planet, from a penny to $20 million will cost less than a few cents. And take less than 10 minutes.  No bank or swift system can possibly do that.

"Banks make money by lending out a fraction of the money deposited with them. ATMs, in theory, attract more people to deposit with them.

In practice, small accounts actually lose them money since the paycheck-to-mouth crowd doesn't deposit enough to be worth serving. That's why most banks waive fees for large accounts and charge fees for small accounts.

"Most of what you said is dishonest nonsense, however this is interesting:

> Yeah, otherwise classes would be classes forever, and people born from rich people would always rule over people born from poor people.

This is a common misconception. Typically there is an inter-generational change in economic behaviour. Riches are often earned by very hardworking, driven and economically rationally people. When those riches are passed down, the children typically have a very different upbringing and a very different relationship to earning, building and maintaining wealth. It's common to see those children quickly burn through their inheritance: this money finds its way back into the general economy and the whole cycle may continue again a few generations later.

^ the above comment is more for anyone else who might be reading. It's something to think about and consider. It makes sense when you consider the kind of incentives and environments that create driven, economically rational people and what kinds of incentives are created by large inheritances and silver-spoon upbringings.

"> You can put a ""promoter of forced resource redistribution"" tag on me, I don't mind at all. Only that somehow the likes of you think resource redistribution is enforced by violence - it's not - you are simply being taxed on your income if you have a job. 

You contradicted yourself within the same sentence. ""[Not] enforced by violence"" followed by... ""taxed on your income if you have a job"". What do you think happens if you don't pay your taxes? You get a letter! What happens if you ignore the letter? You get a knock at the door. What happens if you refuse to let the people knocking in? Eventually they will break in. What happens if you try to stop those people breaking in and stop them from taking your stuff or taking you away? They will use violence? What happens if you continue to defend yourself and your property? It could easily end up with an armed response against you which could easily end up with you lying dead on the floor. At the very least you can expect to be physical controlled and your will probably be injured.

Be honest about what it is you are promoting.

Also: this isn't only done to you if you have a job. All around Europe, the US and the rest of the world people are stolen from, not just from their income but:

* Via forced regular payments to a local government organisation related to their home.
* When they pay for goods and services. The shop owner is forced to charge you extra. Non-compliance with the threats are extreme, so the shop owners will usually obey and you will be ultimately forced to pay this extra, non-voluntary, amount.
* Via inflation: a covert form of tax. Look into what has happened to people in Europe and the US when they have attempted to setup alternative currencies which do not have inflation or they have less inflation. For example the liberty dollar. These people get robbed or caged by the state. One reason Bitcoin's design has been so successful, is for the first time we have an alternative money system which cannot be easily shutdown by the state.

Even if you were **only** getting robbed by working. In the mind of what person, does this suddenly mean there is not threat of violence being employed?

If I make a rule that you can only walk down a given street (one that I do not own) wearing blue clothes and if you disobey I will violently attack you... would you say that I am not enforcing my rule using violence because people could choose to not go down the road or they could choose to wear blue?

> If you don't want to be part of the society and earn money, that's fine, no one is going to ask you for money. Your taxes will be 0.00$.

*If you don't want to be a part of this neighbourhood and run your business here, that's fine, no one is going to ask you for your money. The local mafia will not take that 10% cut from you. The boys wont come after you. You are free to leave.*

> Ah yeah, when the majority of the benefit of businesses go to their owners instead of their employees. 

You want that business owners buildings?

You want their money?

You want to threaten them with violence to give up their property?

> Yeah, those people that were born in a rich family, continued to profit from said businesses/factories, and never worked much in their life. 

You want the inheritance of both peaceful and non-peaceful people? Even though some old dying man or woman, as their dying wish, chose to leave their property to their children and grandchildren... you want that property to be forcefully taken from them under threat of extreme violence, up to and including death? Remember: death threats are what it takes: if you're not willing to go as far as death, then everyone can arm-up and shoot back whenever they are being robbed and they will know that the collectors will immediately leave and never return because they know that death is not permitted.

All of the above is the reality of what you are promoting from. If you want other people's stuff to be taken from them so it can be redistributed as per your desire or some other person's desire, you are advocating for the maintenance of a system of aggression and theft on a mass scale against peaceful people.

> Those people deserve to have 10000x the employee's income.

Why do you focus on extreme examples? You are promoting widescale theft from almost every living adult whether they employ no-one or they employ 100s of people.

I know why you likely do this: it's because you can hide behind it: you can make it seem like you *just want to steal property from the super-rich*; those people that would likely live on happily even if you stole most of their stuff. 

It's an incredibly deceptive way to frame it.

> ~~Public funding~~ [Stealing to fund government organisations] is just fine. 

FTFY

The fact that alternative phrases are invented for things which already have perfectly accurate phrases should be very telling to you and others. I don't need to invent an alternative word to describe bird feeding. I just call it bird feeding.

> It would be a disaster if everything was privatized. No public services, no roads, no army. That'd be the fastest failing nation.

I think you're wrong, but this is a whole different discussion and one which I would not have with you because you are currently showing yourself to be dishonest. If you were honest you would straight up accept that you promote theft, but you would make your case for *why you think this forced taking of other people's property is justified or necessary*.

egalitarianism is not about egalitarianism in general. It's just about resource egalitarianism.

I think ""egalitarians"" should just call themselves ""promoters of forced property redistribution"". Doesn't have quite the same ring to it, does it though.

Personally I don't care that some people are vastly more rich than me. So long as they acquired their wealth honesty, good on them. I hope they have fun.

What I do care about is poverty: people suffering because they aren't getting their basic needs met. I do not agree with socialists that large scale theft is the solution. Empirically I know it not to be the solution. Socialists are organising large scale theft right now to end poverty, yet poverty has not been ended: not even close. In-fact I see signs all around me that vast numbers of people are impoverished and things may be getting worse. Solving poverty is a hard task and I have many ideas on how to go about it: none of those ideas require me to steal from another.

* invading foreign lands
* bombing innocent people
* violently imposing economic sanctions on people which stop those people from getting their absolute basic needs for food, water and healthcare met
* incentivizing single mother homes which are completely dependent on state welfare (guess who these people vote for)
* creating laws and legislation which lead to market monopolies & give advantages to large corporations, while hurting small businesses.
* monopolizing certain markets by offering a ""free"" government ""service"" in that market and thus reducing the possibility of the free market providing a cheap and better alternative.
