The question is where do you get the data from. If you get it from some semi-trusted source (you believe they won't DoS you), then what you describe might really be more efficient.

The tldr is, when people get together in groups, you would expect the group to reach a consensus near the middle of all of their opinions. But, when you have groups that begin to lean to one side or another (or a fracture in the group occurs) they actually come to consensus on the extreme, rather than the middle.

The why is, the people in the middle are no longer hearing the arguments from the people on the other side.

They said forks were appropriate when a large % of the ecosystem disagreed with decisions being made.  I was here.  I saw it with my own two eyes.  I have since watched them evolve away from that.

No the problem is when people are restricting block size to PUSH people onto layer 2. 

If there is only 2MB of transaction space and only 6 tx/s can happen on chain, but tx demand for Bitcoin is 50tx/s, where do all the other transactions HAVE to go?

In that scenario we have 6tx/s happening on chain and 44tx/s happening on the L2. That means miners only get paid for 6/50 = 12% of transactions. The other 88% are on centralized layer 2. 

THAT is the direction we are headed in with segwit. By the way segwit was never about scaling it was about restricting block space and enabling L2 systems. It had to get soft forked in because miners wouldn't support it enough for a hard fork. Hopefully now you are staring to see **why** miners would now allow this!

"Well if you don't think layer 2 solutions are a bad idea you may in fact be missing something - the importance of Proof of Work. 

I'm sure you have read the white paper but here it is again. I have read it probably 25+ times but I still find new things in there now and then. Or understand new things atleast. Sometimes it takes a while to click but when it does you will see the pure genius of the white paper design. Anyway, chapter 4 is the one about proof of work: 

https://bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf

Actually, I'll start out by saying proof of work is one of the most important (maybe THE most) parts of the system. A proof of work being performed is what makes your transaction immutable, irreversible and decentralized. Proof of work is how there is no governing authority or ""middleman"" over the transactions. Without proof of work, the system quickly degrades into a centralized one similar to Paypal, all your transactions stored on a server somewhere, no proof of work being performed. And if that's what you want, you should just use Paypal, because they allow money transfers between users for free. It doesn't get much better than free. 

What we want is a proof of work to be performed for every one of our transactions. That means every time we submit a transaction to the network, we want a miner to mine it into a block and we want the miner to get paid a small fee. This is how it works ON CHAIN. 

When we start taking transactions off chain, no proof of work is being performed, no miner is getting paid. The transaction has lost it's main qualities as decentralized and immutable as you are now at the behest of the L2 server operator or LN hub operator. They can now control you and your transaction - blacklist your address, stop you from paying someone else, reverse your payment etc (this is not LN specifically, just Layer 2 in general, since no proof of work is being performed.) So there is really a huge difference in the characteristics of the transaction, if proof of work is being performed or not. Satoshi specifically talks about this in the white paper as well, from the intro:

""Digital signatures provide part of the solution, **but the main benefit is lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double spending.""** 

So in this scenario ^ he is talking about what would happen if we removed POW from the system. We would then be trusting a third party to prevent double spending and the main benefits would be lost. 

So yes, quite literally, the main benefits are lost pushing people onto L2. The transactions become centralized, reversible, blacklist-able, you lose your decentralization, immutability and irreversibility. It looks like we will lose other beneficial qualities going onto L2 as well but these are the main distinguishing features between POW and a centralized processing system thus the most important. 

Basically what the Segwit1x/Segwit2x business model is, is a restricting of block space to push people onto L2. It's corporations trying to hijack and control a public good (block space) and prevent you from doing POW transactions so they can control your transactions on layer 2. Block space is supposed to be market based meaning there is no centrally planned limit - miners can produce blocks as big as they please and they have incentive not to make them too big.

His point is that restricting the block size will always create pressure to make the fees high, and will also create pressure to push people onto Layer 2.

I agree with you in general. And the portion of the price tied to actual spending/transacting is certainly capped, although it could be debated whether that function would actually lead to price appreciation.  But it just seems like it has evolved into more of a wealth storage layer for the whole crypto space...like a reserve currency that really doesn't have much competition for that role due to trust established over a long period of time in addition to massive network effects.  And for such an asset to be slow moving with relatively high fees, it becomes more of a boring utility token that is used to store wealth and save in (rather than spend).  This would magnify it's deflationary aspects by slowing down it's velocity and I would argue that this would benefit the price much more than large scale spending of it would.
