An analogy:
If Bitcoin was a shipping company then the block size would be how big their fleet is.  It doesn't make sense if the company is growing in popularity and getting more demand for their services to reduce the size of the fleet or keep it the same size.  They would expand the fleet as needed to meet the demand at that particular moment.

The numbers, for those that care.

My constants:

- MemStorageCosts: $0.04/TB
- BandwidthCosts : $2/GB
- TransactionFees: $0.03/tx (10x lower than minimum credit card fee)
- NumberOfNodes: 45,750 (10x more than on SegwitCIAMI6chain)
- AverageTXsize: 250 bytes

The cost to the network per tx is then:

NumberOfNodes * (AverageTXsize *  MemStorageCosts + AverageTXsize * BandwidthCosts) = $0.02

The profit per transaction is:

TransactionFees - NumberOfNodes * (AverageTXsize *  MemStorageCosts + AverageTXsize * BandwidthCosts) = $0.01 / tx

At 1GB block size, the TX throughput per year is:

(1 gigabyte / 250 bytes) * NumDays * NumHours * (6 blocks / hour) = 2 x 10^11

which results in profits from tx fees to network operators of **$2.1B**.

On the segwitcoin network, we get about 2 segwitcoins per block in fees or about $420M in revenue.  We won't bother calculate the expenses, but just assume it is all profit.  1GB blocks produce *profit* of $2.1B for network operators on BCC from fee collection at $0.03 per tx, over 5x the *revenue* of fees for segwitcoins.

---

In short, everyone who tells you we need small blocks is:

- mathematically illiterate, or
- a malicious actor trying to destroy bitcoin

If we wanted to increase tx fees to $0.15 (2x lower than minimum credit card charge), run blocks of 1GB, and do it all with 5x as many full nodes as segwitcoin, the total *profit* to network operators would actually be higher, *just from fees*, than the coin generation + fees *revenue* currently on segwitcoin network.";80;8;False;NiceHashWTF;dlpgjy6;First 8MB block mined, with nearly 40,000 transactions;6u1jqt;https://blockchair.com/bitcoin-cash/block/479469

"> ASICBOOST

Jesus, this again? filling it with 8 megs would have nothing to do with ASICBoost. ASICBoost is about reordering the transactions, as you mentioned, and would not need 8 megs worth. Maybe they might need to add one or two more transactions in order for ASICBoost to work, but not fill the block up.

This ASICBoost is really tiring. Segwit is a softfork, so that boost still works with segwit activated. If you really believe that was the reason for the resistance to segwit then you are seriously misinformed.

You are right. It does not have the usage yet, and it is likely it was done to show that we can. Pretty effective arguement against the dangers of 8 meg blocks, wouldn't you say?

"Eh, it depends.

Assuming a straight up 8x throughput increase over Core with full blocks (ignoring SegWit for now), BTC would need a fee that's 8x higher than BCH for the fee profit to be equal. So that's $0.8 for Core vs. $0.1 for BCH.

At the low point in August, median BTC fees were around $0.7, and they've only gone up since. If BCH wants to be fee-competitive, it will need to keep blocks full enough to drive fees to a median of around $0.3 or higher.
