"This article only compares the payment networks (and makes a strong argument that BCH can complete).

But credit cards have several other benefits over (on-chain) BCH:

1. buy on credit
2. buyer protection
3. rewards

The first is the most obvious, you cannot spend BCH you do not have.  Having said that, a company could give you BCH on credit (or even spend from their wallet so you spend their BCH at the register and pay it back later with interest).

The second benefit of credit cards also requires a third party and a fee some some sort to protect the buyer (and probably a higher fee than what credit cards charge, since they can issue charge-backs - said another way, a credit card payment takes weeks to confirm, BCH transactions confirm in minutes).

The third is a bit hard to compare, especially if you expect the value of BCH to increase - so holding is better than spending, which is the opposite of how credit cards work.";1;3;False;jtooker;fekwaxt;BCH is strong competitor for credit card companies (Adeilton_Filho);epmg72;https://read.cash/@Adeilton_Filho/bch-is-strong-competitor-for-credit-card-companies-44433ac7

"Oh, that part is easy. They (i.e blockstream) took over forum moderation, and bought out a lot of key BTC devs, using 75m that they got from banker investors. Then they forced out the previous lead maintainer (who now works on eth). After taking control of the open source repo, there was a multi year debate about how to best scale BTC

In the end, Blockstream ""blocked the stream"" and prevented any substantial BTC scalability optimizations through. In particular, block sizes were capped at 1mb forever (i.e. 1mb of data every 10 min... I.e. 5 transactions a second)

Blockstream has continued to fix bugs, and make small improvements to the system, but it's clear that they don't want it to change much.

"I mean, it basically has a human shaped backdoor in it. No longer need to compromise SHA-2, just a couple people. Way easier to hack people than break encryption algos.

But like what was stated, it's a federated sidechain, so you are trusting someone to be honest. It's kinda funny because Bitcoin is a solution to the Byzantine Generals problem, and every solution being introduced by Blockstream fails to solve that problem (admittedly) and instead tries to make up for scaling shortcomings through trust.

"The smallest possible transaction is taking one input (meaning one UTXO) and sending to one output. You will get the change in a new UTXO, and the recipient will get the payment in a new UTXO. Since the data involved is minimal, the data included in the blockchain is minimal and the fee is minimal.

If you don't have a large enough UTXO, your wallet will combine two or more together. It will need to provide a signature for each independent input, so the amount of on-chain data will be larger and the total fee will be larger. If there are 100 UTXOs, the fee might become significant.

But fees on BCH are really small right now, so this doesn't matter all that much. The real importance of re-combining shuffled UTXOs with CoinJoin is with preserving privacy...

With Cash Shuffle, the BCH are split and shuffled in to smaller and smaller pieces. You can only join a 10-BCH pool with one 10-BCH input, so if you have 8 BCH you will end up joining eight separate 1-BCH shuffles. So by nature of how it works, shuffling coins breaks them into more, smaller UTXOs.

If you spent all eight of those shuffled BCH in one transaction, re-combining them, it would be obvious that all eight belong to one person. If any of those UTXOs is linked to you in real life, now all eight are. Privacy is not only degraded for your own on-chain history, but it is degraded for everyone in those shared pools by method of eliminating you as a ""known.""

So the real benefit of CoinJoin is to re-combine your smaller UTXOs in a way that doesn't link them together and un-do the privacy gained through Cash Shuffle. Then you have one anonymized large UTXO, and you can use it to pay one larger bill without degrading your privacy.";3;0;False;melllllll;fek9fy3;Where can we watch these stats?;epil02;https://twitter.com/acidsploit/status/1217779200876253184

A linear complexity increase is still an increase, right?

Of what I understand from Whitepaper and Amaury's explanations, a transaction which is unconfirmed is always more computationally expensive, because you need to follow all previous unconfirmed transactions to a confirmed root.

If the former is true, this is even better, my solution is not even needed for relaying nodes, just for mining nodes.

> So the CPU cost is made every single time a new transaction comes in that extends an unconfirmed chain.

"It actually appears linear, I think, is because in my test the block sizes get much bigger with longer chains and so there is a little more looping going on, so not exactly an apple to apples. I think if I reran the tests making the block sizes equal, meaning mine 40/500 chains vs 10/2000 chains, there would probably be no difference but I don't have the proof of that.  But, in the general case, where we mine all the transactions in the chain (because there is enough block space), there isn't any post processing at all because in BU's implementation we delete all the transactions from the mempool that were in the block ""before"" we do the post processing, whereas in Core they process each individual transaction ,updating ancestor  state all along the chain. This is a horrible waste of time, but even in cases where we only mine a couple of transactions in the chain the BU node has very little difference in post block processing.

So we have results like this:


BU:             Response time (secs) to mine 10 chains each 2000 txns long

25 txns mined /2000 txn chain :     0.15  secs

1975 txn mined /2000 txn chain:   0.148  secs


Core:             Response time (secs) to mine 10 chains

25 txns mined/2000 txn chain:      53.7 secs

1975 txns mined/2000 txn chain:   1.848 secs

You can see, interestingly, that the fewer txns mined in Core the faster it gets, and that's obviously because there are fewer mined txns which have to have their chains updated.  So the more we mine (which we tend to mine all the txns in BitcoinCash) the slower the BitcoinCore (ABC) code gets.

The quadratic issue is due to the chosen design which Core wrote and ABC is maintaining in their client. It is only for the feature ChildPaysForParent.

There is no need to have this feature in anything but a mining node, but that doesn't mean the software allows you to turn it off if you run ABC as a non-mining node.

ps.

From the video interview by micropresident several months ago it looked very much like its code is all over the client and very hard to maintain.

Remember; ABC was forked from Core AFTER the segwit code was added. SegWit is a horrible design that causes changes all over the codebase. Which is the number one reason we rejected it. ABC removed most SegWit features, but the design stayed as ABC wants to copy most changes Core does. That would become impossible if they started moving code.

What is happening is interesting in the context of inter-client competition:

To me this is free market competition and leads to better node implementations because all implementations would be forced to compete.

That's OK, assuming we can solve the issue in the non-mining nodes right away, the problem of mining nodes still remain.

From what you have said I think that the problem with my proposal vs CPFP is not that it won't work. The computations in mining node still need to be done, the transaction chain still has to be traversed.

And ABC node still stops at 25 loops of processing, because this is the uConfTxChainLen limit.

So it is computationally expensive and I don't see why including more fees and then checking for more fees before interrupting the loop wouldn't fix it.

Also I think that the fee from CPFP transaction can be included in the total fee computation, so... **my proposal actually works in a very similar way to existing CPFP mechanism**?

I mean 

- In my proposal - I wait for an increased fee on each computational iteration. If there is a fee, transaction is relayed or mined.

- In CPFP - You check for fees on each iteration and if there is a fee, you mine transactions previously spotted in the chain that were unpaid.

"What I don't get with the long chains of unconfirmed transactions is the simple fact how they are meant to propagate through the network.

lets say there is a node holding say a valid chain of 400 uncofirmed transactions in its mempool, and then someone emits a burst of another hundred transactions. the 401st one arrives at our node, is validated and everything is alright. then the 403rd one arrives - it is not valid and gets rejected. then 404,405,406-500, all are thrown away because they are invalid and depend on not existent outputs. then 403 arrives and is valid, but we don't have the 96 previous transactions anymore.

the missing ones will trickle in slowly, forwarded by other nodes, which build a valid chain step by step. but this will take a long time because all nodes will reject every transaction but the next one in the chain. So while a single transaction needs under a second to hit most mempools, a long chain would need way longer. Parts of it could be mined into a block in the meantime so a chain can split into shorter chains, which makes the emitter overpay on fees because he calculated for a longer chain. 

Another problem: while the long chain makes its way slowly through the mempools an attacker has much time to emit a second transaction which doublespends some outputs and makes a big part of the previous chain invalid.

That is correct. A normal mempool has no need to do these computations. Only a mempool that is used for mining and where child-pays-for-parent is used.

> So you're telling me that a relaying node does not follow the depth of the chain? It relays the transaction without checking if it is valid?

The cost is not the following of the depth. The cost is due to the calculation of effective fees.

Imagine a transaction paying 1 sat and then a transaction-child paying 100 sats per byte.  They are taken together as a pair and the total sats-per-byte is calculated in order to prioritize it.

You can imagine that this gets more and more expensive the longer the chain. But if you don't give a s*it about the fees of clumps of transactions then that cost isn't there. And non-mining nodes don't care.

> Elaborate please?

CPFO (this seems a good [explanation](https://themerkle.com/what-is-child-pay-for-parent/)) changes the mempool fee calculation from looking at every transaction individually to having to look at groups of transactions.

The main reason (as the linked article explains) is that someone send one transaction with too low a fee and blocks are full so his transaction never gets mined. So he sends a second transaction with higher fee in order to ""bump"" his first transaction.

Well, I think it has to be. If the cost of processing goes up quadratically, then the fee has to go up quadratically too. If the person making the transaction pay less than the processing cost, then someone else will be bearing the burden of that cost. In the examples you mentioned, someone has to spend money to buy those powerful CPUs or mining machines.";3;1;False;MobTwo;fejq0x5;Solving the Long Unconfirmed Chains problem;epijvo;https://read.cash/@ShadowOfHarbringer/solving-the-long-unconfirmed-chains-problem-a466b1a1
"> The first problem with long unconfirmed chains is, that they are very CPU-intensive and to make it worse, their calculation requirements rise not in linear, but quadratic fashion.

This is correct. If I understand your suggestion correctly, the user has to pay higher fees for a longer unconfirmed chained transaction. Since as you mentioned, the processing cost goes up in quadratic fashion, which means the fees would be too. I think doing this is not solving the actual problem, but making it expensive so that businesses can't complain about it, lol. It's like telling the business, ""Hey, you can do 10000 chained transactions today, stop complaining, you just have to pay $1000000 in fees.""

I have been deliberately keeping myself away from technical discussions because people keep having this misconception that I am a developer. I love coding for fun but I don't like to do it for work. So if I say something stupid coming up, please understand.

I think the better solution is to have an algorithm that can handle such unconfirmed chained transactions, without this quadratic rise in processing cost. I don't know if this is possible, but that would resolve the root cause of the problem. However, I understand that this requires lots of development work, not just now but also maintaining the codes moving forward, and I can understand ABC's position on this. I remember someone wrote a long explanation about the development work and cost on this issue, can't find the link if someone knows what I am talking about please comment.

">Did that idea also include a buffer variable?

It shouldn't be necessary to try to account for temporary differences in chaintip between nodes. Most commonly it's just because a new block is being digested. If there is a persistent difference, there's some bigger problem.

Depths change anyway when some, but not all, ancestors of a tx get into a block.

So doesn't flowee need to do the computations?

Of what Amaury explained me I understood that you need complex calculation of quadratically increasing complexity in order to acquire the length of the unconfirmed chain info.

Is this incorrect?

> This is wrong. Only mining nodes need such a change.

So you're telling me that a relaying node does not follow the depth of the chain? It relays the transaction without checking if it is valid?

To give an example , to process 10 , 2000 tx chains on my own laptop using the old Core code would take 50 seconds...with BU it only takes 0.15 seconds. So we've solved the worst of the problems. There is only one other issue which is tx admission, however that's actually not that big a deal..in BU, it takes on average just 300 micros per txn for a 500 txn chain (500 being the default that BU intends to run with)...so in short , BU has CPFP and the ability to process long chains without the need for some complex fee scheme.

"Bitcoin doesn't fix this. Only Monero. 

Transactions in Bitcoin are censorable at miner level. Pools can choose to blacklist transactions involving a certain blacklisted address or UTXO. 

Imagine a serial killer who rapes and murders children. He posts a Bitcoin address, asking for donations to keep his killing spree going. Several Bitcoins are sent to that address. Now the killer starts spending these coins, buying whatever. Would it be morally right for majority of miners to censor transactions from his donation address? Absolutely. Would it be possible for miners to do that? Yes. That makes Bitcoin censorable.

Imagine a Chinese corporate CEO who turns into a proponent of democracy and human rights. She has a considerable wealth stored in BTC and BCH, so that the Communist Party can't confiscate them. But alas! Chinese SHA256 miners, who hold an overwhelming majority in hash rate of both BTC and BCH are instructed by Chinese Police to blacklist any addresses known to be connected to the former CEO. She is stranded - sending these coins to any other address simply doesn't work, her TX takes months to confirm, and when it does, authorities just add that new address to a blacklist.

">Contrarian / Greg Maxwell (and some troll campaigns), playing both sides  against each other and get them to fight against each other. In case  people here won’t aware of what happened, he tried to incite BCH  community to attack BSV and then went over to the BSV community to  incite attacks against BCH. It’s a good tactic, you incite infighting  between the two big blockers camp and when they are busy fighting each  other, the banks win and you don’t need to get your own hands dirty.

BSV was a much bigger attack than you imply, Greg Maxwell's shitposting was the least of our worries. BSV had 50+ million dollars behind it, and featured a well-oiled PR machine, huge mining farms, and plenty of intel backing. Craig Wright was the point man, he tried to bully and frighten everyone he encountered and convince them that BSV was taking over BCH.  BSV full-on attacked BCH mining infrastructure, and it took 8 exahashes of BCH mining to subjugate Craig the madman. Also, the ABC devs wisely added different opcodes than BSV did, which allowed coins to be quickly forked to the BCH chain.  Many technical things had to be done behind the scenes to preserve BCH security, and we should be thankful that there was an awesome team doing those things. 

BSV is not really worth attacking at this point, anybody who is anybody in the crypto scene knows that BSV is fake. BSV transactions are artificially generated, the mining is centrally controlled by Craig and Calvin, and the coin will descend to basically zero value as soon as they stop wash trading the coin.";20;2;False;wtfCraigwtf;fej5mxd;Beware of infighting attack vectors;epfc2o;https://read.cash/@MobTwo/beware-of-infighting-attack-vectors-ee2893f0

"BTC was captured and mutated into Blockstream's altcoin, which they and their sycophant buttcoiners dishonestly push as if its the same thing when it objectively is not. How is it still ""peer to peer cash"" when it is now low-throughput, high fee, unpredictable garbage on top of which Blockstream is building off-chain products so you never actually use Bitcoin, but their retarded Liquid L-BTC sidechain they control, or Lightning Network which is a semi-custodial system of nonsense that spits in the face of what Bitcoin was built to be: a destroyer of such middlemen.

Accept no substitutes, BCH is the only successful chain fork for a reason: it is the only one that carried forward with its intended purpose as laid down by Satoshi 11 years ago, which is *what made Bitcoin valuable and worth building on* early on. Do you think Blockstream's system would have been popular if that is how BTC started? Hell no.

I would be more excited if American Express Platinum accepted cryptocurrency payments to pay off statements each month. There is no cryptocurrency that's going to give away free passenger airplane tickets, front to the line boarding, and free checked-in luggage like American Express does.

 Let's say you purchased a haircut and you came home only to discover it looks like shit, how do you dispute a purchase like that using crypto?

For the last 20-plus years I have disputed just about any purchase I wasn't satisfied with and I always got a full refund. I even got my money back on concerts I thought totally sucked.

I also use examples of what I just said to onboard brand new merchants to accepting crypto. If they are tired of assholes with their American Express Platinum cards disputing everything they aren't happy with maybe they should switch to accepting crypto instead. 

I will point out the merchant option to them on bitpay and they have the option of accepting different cryptos and having it go straight to their Bank. They still need that money for paying their bills even though the goal is to get everyone to just stay on crypto. 

It's baby steps and eventually they will evolve. Eventually they will realize crypto is a great investment and they will start moving their savings into crypto and even purchase a hardware wallet once they are fully into it.

I will give someone $10 worth of crypto for free if I know they are someone who's going to eventually invest in it.

But in the next bull run (assuming there will be more bull runs), that unreasonably high transaction fee period will most likely be a lot longer than just one month and then even the dumbest (or just uninformed) of people will realize that the small blockers have intentionally or unintentionally destroyed BTC and that the legitimate Bitcoin variant is currently BCH. Assuming that people are intelligent and informed enough then BCH is likely to flip BTC in terms of market cap shortly thereafter.

"I am proposing a BCH-adoption focused system, not a general use mechanical turk.

I am proposing people be paid to perform discrete, verifiable tasks that materially advance BCH use and awareness.

I am proposing people are paid with an SLP token. The SLP token can be bootstrapped to value by SLP exchanges listing it as an act of solidarity with the ecosystem and because we will be getting thousands of merchants to accept it as a form of payment for goods and services at the very least in Latam.

This resolves the problem of whales failing to finance the building of the ecosystem out of the goodness of their briny hearts.

Anything remotely like what we are talking about requires market fit for the developing world, which requires people from the developing world, expertise, cultural knowledge, marketing ability. If you don't have that, you need to get it before declaring any similar project a failure. My team and I at BCH Latam have 2 years experience doing crypto adoption and marketing in Latam. We have it.

I support the young man doing the leafletting but we at BCH Latam already have a working adoption model that onboarded 1300 merchants and 5000+ confirmed new crypto users across 20 Latam cities in 2018-2019.

We're far beyond leafletting, signing up individual coffee shops or other laudable volunteer adoption work.

This proposal is the next stage.

For instance a 20 bits encryption is twice harder to break than 19 bit encryption. When you talk about 100+ bit encryption, it's getting pretty strong.

But I can't really think of any myself. I suppose the miner can still mine tx A, even while they notify the network that tx B is a double-spend of tx A.

"> Debian

I don't think so.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian#Debian_version_history

> In 1996, **Bruce Perens assumed** the project leadership. Perens was a controversial leader, regarded as authoritarian and strongly attached to Debian.[47] He drafted a social contract and edited suggestions from a month-long discussion into the Debian Social Contract and the Debian Free Software Guidelines.[48] After the FSF withdrew their sponsorship in the midst of the free software vs. open source debate,[49] Perens initiated the creation of the legal umbrella organization Software in the Public Interest instead of seeking renewed involvement with the FSF.[45] He led the conversion of the project from a.out to ELF.[40] He created the BusyBox program to make it possible to run a Debian installer on a single floppy, and wrote a new installer.[50] By the time Debian 1.2 was released, the project had grown to nearly two hundred volunteers.[40] Perens left the project in 1998.[51]

> Ian Jackson became the leader in **1998**.[52] Debian 2.0 introduced the second official port, m68k.[43] During this time the first port to a non-Linux kernel, Debian GNU/Hurd, was started.[53] On **December 2**, the first **Debian Constitution** was ratified.[54] 

> Leader election (1999–2005) **From 1999, the project leader was elected yearly**

Apparently Debian is a democracy from 1999, not from the beginning. It was authoritarian for 6 years, before going democracy.

Makes tremendous difference.

And still BU is not only a democracy, but is a dumb style of democracy. It does not elect a leader like Debian, but lets members vote on different matters. And these people don't have to be actual citizens ""living in"" BU - meaning having a stake in the project, so people that have different vested interests and visions can vote on the current issues.

"No the USD goes to a market maker who is providing liquidity in another pair.

Let's say there is 1 market maker in BTC/USD offering 1 BTC for 10k. There is another in BCH/USD offering 11 BCH for 1k each. The BCH/BTC ratio is 0.1 and there is a market maker offering 1 BTC for 11 BCH.

An arbitrage bot places a sell order on BTC/USD for 1 BTC at 12k because of the other 2 markets. Now you have 2 BTC for sale.

You then buy 2 BTC for a total of 22k. The first 10k goes to the BTC/USD market maker. The bot turns around and buys 11 BCH for 11k USD. He then sells 11 BCH for 1 BTC. USD doesn't come back into BTC/USD, it left for BCH/USD.

Your 22k was split 10k toward BTC/USD market maker, 11k toward BCH/USD market maker and 1k toward arbitrage bot. One simple market making technique is to maintain equal value of both coins, so they are perfectly fine to have more USD and won't be trading it back immediately since they are still balanced due to price increase.

The point of this is this 1 BTC for 12k USD was imported liquidity from the BCH/USD and BCH/BTC market makers. In other words, each market leverages other market's native liquidity. Without that arbitrage bot, the next available order might have been at 14k.

That is how USD bleeds into other markets. It may seem unfair because you were buying BTC and ended up supporting other coins, but liquidity would be much thinner and you would have had a worse deal without it.";2;1;False;Tiblanc-;fel3tw2;Automated unnatural crypto market manipulation linkages?;ep13eh;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/ep13eh/automated_unnatural_crypto_market_manipulation/

> I do not see the logic there matches your claim the alt price would rise. If you can, please show the math with prices rather than ratios

I'm not sure what you mean here, I did use prices rather than ratios.

> I think it looks like you suggest a rise in USD value of BTC makes alts go down (0.05 instead of 0.1) (not up).

I point out that if the order is to have the same value as the pre rise price the post rise price must be marked down and if it is not then the post rise price is indeed effectively higher. Most often in actual practice though the post rise prices are marked down, so it looks like they're falling unless you chart them directly against usd rather than btc.

> I wonder if the argument I do not agree with is that a rising BTC USD value means the USD value is dropping and that's why the rest of crypto seems to rise? I do not believe that.

Once again I'm not sure I understand what there is to believe. We have an exchange rate of one apple to one banana.

"> You do not know how difficult it is to double-spend BCH from within the store

It's very easy to at least attempt a double spend with a popular electron-cash wallet. I have just tried it myself: https://i.imgur.com/ew6JD9a.png

Please note that the double spend transaction had been submitted 1 minute later (after leaving the ""shop""). And then everything is up to the miners.

Bitcoin Unlimited nodes are relaying double-spend transactions and represent roughly half of the BCH network (my ElectrumX server is running a BU node). And since my double spend attempt was successfully registered at https://doublespend.cash/ website, I'm assuming that miner nodes also received it and potentially could accept a higher fee transaction.

BCH retail commerce is relying on trust that the customers won't attempt double spends in shops and miners won't accept higher fee transactions.

> BCH has cash-fusion while privacy on LN is undermined by LN's centralism

These are two entirely different privacy solutions. Cash-fusion works by bloating the blockchain while LN is reducing the bloat. And there is of course no centralism in LN regardless of how much you wish it was there.

Blockchain bloat is currently not a problem for BCH thanks to its negligible user base.

">	Again you don’t seem to grasp what ‘currency ‘means. BTC ‘maxing out’ is also not really descriptive of reality. Blocks can be full and you could still end up in the next block with 1 or 2 sat/b. It’s all about time preference. I know you probably make sense in your own mind, but it would help if you could use the right words when you talk to other people.

Long unpredictable confirmation break bitcoin as a currency too.

During Nov/Dec17 1/2sat tx would never be confirmed and dropped by the network.

I sent a $1.5 tx fee transaction in Dec17 and it took 4 weeks to confirm.

BTC being low capacity absolutely break the p2pecash use case.

BTC is simply a high friction blockchain for second layer solution. Simple as that.

>	But anyway, the important metric is more fundamental than fees, it’s about what Satoshi wrote in the Genesis block, the headline about the bailout of banks.

BCH does just as good as a job regarding that.

I would argue better, as BCH the currency doesn’t rely on pure speculation alone but usage too.

>	you can’t allow the situation where you rely on miners staying honest and stop users from validating the rules and their incoming transactions.

It is the compromise BTC made, very expensive chain to make the chain cheap to audit.

(I wonder who are those people that cannot afford to run node bit can afford to use BTC?)

The consequence of that is that BTC doesn’t work as  p2pecash anymore and huge departure for the original design economics.

Satoshi was fine with average user not running a node. SPV wallet are described in the white paper after all.


>	You totally ignored that until now that BSV goes a step further than BCH. Now it’s all about subtlety and dev controlling the network apparently. Who says how big thw blocks can ve to preserce decentralization and also stay ‘usable’ (I don’t agree with that word here, but for the sake of argument I will indulge you).

BCH made the block limit a user config parameter so that dev are not in charge of the economic property of the network, unlike with BTC now.

>	I don’t care much about price either, but it is the only objective metric we have in measuring usage/adoption. People are willing to pay x amount for 1 bitcoin and it is about 30 times more than they are willing to pay for 1 BCH.

Price is not an indication of usage/adoption.

..unless your are a Ponzi scheme..

Transaction per second/merchant adoption is a much better metric, the rest is speculation.

>	You can think the market is stupid, but it is merely a reflection about what the world thinks.

I think the market is not interested in usefulness/adoption but only speculation so far.

>	And be honest, Bitcoin first did 8 years of the work to build the brand alone and so BCH had a head start like any other altcoin or fork out there. Crypto didn’t exist before Bitcoin, so 2,5 years now is not that short to be honest. BSV is much younger and is now on par with BCH.

Not on par regarding merchant adoption and disruptive potential.

There is more than price to crypto.

>	And I’m afraid you heavily underestimate the industry that is build around Bitcoin and the development happening there. There are many companies building on Bitcoin and probably about a dozen big podcasts devoted to Bitcoin alone, with most of them pumping out 1 or more episodes a week.

Ok can you give one or two protocol improvement implemented in BTC and why it is important?

Or maybe one new app/service based on BTC that has disruptive potential?

>	But let’s end this discussion now, we won’t convince each other anyway. Which is fine

I actually think it is a worthwhile discussion, like my question on BTC protocol improvement, nobody has been able to reply to it yet. all BTC supporter I ask seem to not be interested in anything else than price.


>	Oh, and I think BSV is totally hopeless and Craig is a deranged individual and probably needed this pump to dump on his followers to cover for the losses of the lawsuit against him. Plus Calvin might be getting anxious to get some of his millions back.
