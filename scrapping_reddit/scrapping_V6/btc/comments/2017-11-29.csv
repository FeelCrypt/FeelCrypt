"Sure if you really want me to. The ""BCH CEO"" one is just retarded. Rick falkringe made a post calling himself Bitcoin Cash CEO, and was basically just talking about how everyone is whatever they want in bitcoin cash because the roles don't really matter. So you are the CEO of Bitcoin Cash and so am I. So anyone that says BCH has a CEO is basically proving to you that they only read headlines and not the actual posts.

Craig S. Wright has a Lamborghini. So what? He's saying he bought this lambo ""after the pump"" like he pumped BCH just to have money for the lambo, when in reality he already had that lambo before the rapid run up in BCH.

The last article is the worst of all. It doesn't prove anything at all. It's just some guy describing every cryptocurrency in 4 words, and the words he chose were bitcoin clone. Really doesn't mean anything or make any point about BCH.

The first article is just a bunch of ad hominems. Only attacks on the people, not what they are saying or believe in. I couldn't care less that Roger Ver was jailed for selling explosives multiple years ago, Mandela was in jail for multiple years. BCH isn't centralized in the slightest, and the post provides no proof of this. Just look at the mining pools and their percentage of total hash power in BCH compared to BTC. If anything BTC looks more centralized.

So yeah they're all completely pointless arguments. They don't prove anything, that's why everyone just downvoted and didn't care to reply.

"I've got people calling me now :)

Last Tuesday at a pre-holiday  cocktail hour, a long time business associate brings up the topic of Bitcoin (since I used to bring it up 2 years ago). ""I heard it hit $9K.""

His staffer immediately pounces, ""It's a bubble! Nothing but a scam!""

I unwind the staffer's hyperbole and it made it clear he knows nothing about Bitcoin, but only to press upon him that we will need to start his education at the beginning. I also told him he doesn't have to invest and he probably shouldn't if he doesn't want to understand it, and certainly no more than he could stand to lose.

Within an hour after leaving the gathering, both my associate and his staffer independently sent me headlines about a Bitcoin bubble, and both articles where complete utter strawman, sky-is-falling garbage. Nothing of merit.

I replied with a link to *100+ Bitcoin Obituaries* and one simple fact:

**If Facebook only had 21 million shares, the common stock price would be $25K.** Is Bitcoin really over priced? Which one is really a bubble? Sharing your relationship status and selfies vs. facilitating worldwide peer-to-peer transactions.

"As one who got into Bitcoin around 2013 its been a fantastic and terrifying voyage so far watching this space grow every day. 

I honestly have no idea myself what is happening, there are a lot of forces at work as said between bots, hype, China/Korea getting heavy and pumping *everything* lately, Bitfinex's monopoly money manipulation, exchange manipulation that would be illegal anywhere else, etc.

I should feel excited but I don't even sitting on 500+% unrealized fiat gains this year (I left BTC behind for Etheruem last year predicated on the vast nothing and toxicity going on with development), something definitely doesn't feel right. It is either because no market bulls forever and a lot of this may in fact be fraudulent and waiting to send us to bear hell for a few years, or that I believe it actually could bull for very long time as it consumes the fiat economy, as in this isn't a giant bubble (but will still have blowoffs here and there), but the beginning of mass *transition* which we've just never seen before in financial history.

At least the future won't be boring, and highly profitable if you play your cards right.

With one million usd u can pump the price of btc by 100usd. 16mil existing coins x 100 dollar = 1.600.000.000usd. so with 1 million added money to the total, the market cap can increase by 1.6 billion.

"Actually I thought about this and he is correct (but feel free to correct me if I'm wrong here).


Market cap can increase in two ways without investment. 


Example 1: Say I mine the genesis block and get 50 of Coin A. At this point, Coin A has no value and thus a market cap of 0. Now let's say I sell those coins to someone for $10. The market cap is now $500. Now say I mine another block and get 50 more coins. The total market cap is now $1000, but the total investment is still only $500. Now to be fair I did invest in mining hardware.


Example 2: Say there are 2 coins (owned by person A and person B) in circulation and the value is $10. Market cap is now $20. Both person A and B bought from a miner at $10. At this point total investment = total market cap. Let's say person B sells their coin to a person C for $11. As we know, price is just the value of the most recent trade. In this example. The amount invested is $21, but the market cap is $22.

"These kind of rapid climbs scare me.  I don't see how this kind of growth is sustainable.  And it's definitely not what you want for a currency that you want transacted on a daily basis instead of fiat.

I mean, having it hit $10,000 is amazing, if you want to treat Bitcoin as an investment.  But if you want it to be the money of the future, this is bad.

It seems to me that the goal of Bitcoin Segwit is to become an investment, and the goal of Bitcoin Cash, to be what it's name implies: cash.  If that's the case, I hope BCH doesn't see these kind of huge swings.

A slight correction:

That quote is not from an email exchange between Satoshi and Mike Hearn.

It was a reply to James Donald who had posted the very first response when the Bitcoin white-paper was original released on a crypto mailing list.

[Re: Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper](https://marc.info/?l=cryptography&m=122567739309991)

If the system was not able to scale, then the white-paper would never have been released in the first place.

Work would've continued until the scaling issues were figured out.

But scaling had been figured out and it's mentioned in the white-paper under its own section.

"**Straw man**

A straw man is a common form of argument and is an informal fallacy based on giving the impression of refuting an opponent's argument, while refuting an argument that was not presented by that opponent. One who engages in this fallacy is said to be ""attacking a straw man"".

The typical straw man argument creates the illusion of having completely refuted or defeated an opponent's proposition through the covert replacement of it with a different proposition (i.e., ""stand up a straw man"") and the subsequent refutation of that false argument (""knock down a straw man"") instead of the opponent's proposition.

This technique has been used throughout history in polemical debate, particularly in arguments about highly charged emotional issues where a fiery ""battle"" and the defeat of an ""enemy"" may be more valued than critical thinking or an understanding of both sides of the issue.

"Altruism shouldn't be such a foreign concept.

[Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/) is a private peer-to-peer backup project. You can put the service on your computers and phones then select which folders to keep in sync across all the devices you trust. One of the key components allows the local application to use a relay server to break double-NAT like environments to get their data out of a ""corporate"" network, onto the open internet, and back.

[These are the live relay servers](http://relays.syncthing.net/) run almost entirely by volunteers. Some have sane limits, some are wide open, but all of them are being hosted by someone else so Average Joe can keep his phone pictures synced with his computer effortlessly.

Bitcoin Full Nodes are no different. Syncthing Relay servers mainly require bandwidth since they don't store any of the intermittent traffic, but like you said storage is so cheap you could add a cloud volume for a few bucks extra a month and always serve the last 10 years of the block chain **today**!

"I guess cheap isn't the same for everyone. Not against BCH here but I just think it's too early. You do understand there are still ALOT of people who can barely access the internet and even if they do, they barely understand the blockchain technology heck they don't even have an idea of the cloud. If you scale too quickly people will be left out both in terms of tech and info which kinda leaves them behind. Adoption is the thing that will scale any cryptocurrency or technology in general. 

Bigger block sizes will come in my opinion but not like this. If you think the solution is that simple, imagine 10 years back you only had 1GB Standard HDD for your movie collection. Once its full you can only delete those that you have watched. So if ever you had a new movie, and you haven't watched all that were in your drive you'd have to wait and watch it first before you delete it and then add the new movie. If scaling was that simple heck people will stop semiconductor and any other technology research and since 1GB was relatively cheap for them it would be fair to say ""Let's just keep on increasing the storage, storage is cheap anyway"", keep doing that for 10 years and you'll see its not that sustainable. 

It would be nice to know that block size is just one of many scaling factors but it does not mean that focusing only on one and on its own would scale the chain in an ideally sustainable way.

"Ok, so lets look at the edges and for brevity lets just look at network speed. How do you think the mempool is propagated to nodes? Lets take the most naive assumption, that its just hosted somewhere and everyone downloads it periodically. Not true, but cool. Even this breaks down at blocksizes greater than what you can download in about a minute - because remember, the difficulty is such that every 10 minutes a new block gets created, on average. Eventually if its too hard to fill your block with transactions before someone else can mine a block, people will just start mining near-empty blocks because doing so is much faster. Can you download a GB in a minute? Maybe enough people can that its still fine. What about 100GB (worldwide adoption as currency)? 1TB (microtransactions / streaming money)?

And all that is besides the point that what actually happens when you broadcast a transaction to the network is that you send it to some node that then re-broadcasts it to the rest of the network. Algorithms are used to diff the transactions on node X and node Y so that only the differences are sent (Merkle tree magic), then depending on the node's storage capacity transactions with a fee too low are dropped. That's a shitload of traffic, moreso if the mempool is a few GB in size. Not to mention all the computing power needed to diff the local mempool and the remote mempool and the fact that this grows exponentially as more nodes try to cooperate. 

In conclusion, idk, you're dumb or something. At the very least you don't understand why the technical limitations are in fact limitations and that ""add more RAM"" in engineering is generally a ""keep doing business this week"" solution and not a long term technical solution. Sometimes you need to add more RAM; I think we are at this point for Bitcoin. Its not ""the solution"" though.";-1;2;False;zenethics;dqivg0n;"There never was a ""scaling problem.""

"I don’t think it’s people don’t want Bitcoin to scale.  Because that carries the assumption that there is an understanding between the differences and a conscious decision between scale vs not scale.

I just think it’s that MOST people who buy bitcoin do so because they look at it as digital gold. That is the selling point.

I would wager that a large amount of money is betting on bitcoin as a store of value and as bitcoin becomes more main stream that will be the selling point.

"Extremely True. 

What I hate the most is when people like Theymos come around and speak as if Satoshi was some clueless incompetent guy who wasn't sure of the capability and extend of his creation.

One such example: https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/why-did-satoshi-nakamoto-abandon-bitcoin/

Some excerpts for convenience (Quotes from Theymos):

""You have to understand that the ideas behind Bitcoin are not way out there. All of the crypto already existed, and even the idea of a block chain already largely existed in the form of git. Satoshi didn’t need to be a mathematician, cryptographer, or master software engineer to come up with the ideas behind Bitcoin and then implement them.""

""In fact, I think that Satoshi might not have been much of a programmer before building Bitcoin. But he was dedicated and detail-oriented. Maybe he read a good C++ book front-to-back before starting on the coding, and then put real effort into following best practices (with a large amount of success, though some imperfection).""

""He didn’t have a solid idea for long-term scalablity. He’d always planned to implement SPV in his client, but doing so looked like it’d take some major hacking. He’d had vague plans of auctions & trading systems built into the client, but he couldn’t find a good design for these things. Etc.""

Sure, you can argue that Satoshi wasn't the best programmer out there. But, you know what's more important than that?

His stuff worked and it worked well. 

Aside from coding, what's undeniable was that Satoshi had a real knack for economics, some argue even more so than programming and his insights have always been precise and clear cut. (I'm not of a programming background, so spare me for this one)

Regardless if you really adore the guy or not, one thing that should be undeniable is that Satoshi is an intelligent guy who had thought things through, and the fact that Bitcoin Cash can continue moving on in accordance to what was outlined in the whitepaper is the proof of that.

"There are different approaches to scaling that weight in different risks and end-user possibilities. It is not that simple to determine which approach is the best, it is perfectly fine for different groups to pursue different approaches - there are very smart people on both ends (unfortunately there are trolls on both ends as well). 

Andreas Antonopoulos has a [great presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AecPrwqjbGw) on this topic. In it, he explains how the requirements for the network may increase faster than what technology would need to sustain it adequately without causing severe centralization. It is a possible scenario, but no one can claim to know what will it happen for sure. That narrative resonates with me, but at the same time I don't take it for granted, and it may very well be wrong. At the bare minimum, it is possible to say that this method of scaling increases the likelihood of centralization, and that is enough for a lot of people to prefer an alternate method of scaling. Ironically, I also feel that Bitcoin's block size will inevitably increase over time, but it will increase at a rate that is levels of magnitude lower than if it were scaling uniquely by increasing block size. 

Even Roger Ver himself has admitted that there is the potential for Bitcoin's approach to be more adequate in the future (otherwise he would have sold all his bitcoins). I am on the opposite side of that, I think Bitcoin is more likely to succeed, but I also see value in the approach Bitcoincash is pursuing... so I am still holding some BCH and I do not intend on trading it for BTC.";3;1;False;TheWierdGuy;dqiy737;"There never was a ""scaling problem.""

"> 1. is a group who believes that larger blocks will cause fatal mining centralization. The problem with this belief is that the cost to store and transmit blockchain data is a tiny fraction of the cost to mine. Most of the costs to mining are electricity consumption, plant, property, mining equipment, and personnel. **Storage for a year's worth of totally-full 32MB ""paypal level"" blocks is roughly $100 in today's prices and coming down all the time.** But the cost to actually reliably mine a Bitcoin block is (edit: tens-to-) hundreds of thousands of dollars per day. Storage and data transmission don't even enter into the equation. Others point to the orphaning problem inherent in relaying large blocks but this is essentially erased by xthin blocks and miners being on an ultrafast network. In short the idea that bigger blocks will cause mining centralization is total speculation and could in fact be dead wrong.

Let's break this down to show how ridiculously low the cost is.

$100 / 365.25 (average days in a year) = $0.27378 per day

"I think this is somewhat disingenuous. True, on-chain scaling even with present technology is completely adequate to accommodate a massive multiple increase in transactions on the BTC chain. 2MB, 8MB blocks aren't going to appreciably increase costs or supposed centralization. 


But as you move to larger blocksizes (32-128MB+), especially now, and those that can accommodate a *global reserve* monetary network, there are real challenges. Bandwidth caps being implemented by ISPs could very significantly deter individuals' ability to run a node, especially a helpful full node that can maintain an extra copy of the blockchain and connect to many peers.  And with very, very large blocks, there is a greater risk of orphanage due to slower propogation (were this an issue you'd just expect miners to adjust their own block sizes relative to fees to accommodate this risk- though this could lead to rather high fees during peak times to entice miners to take a risk).


Now there are some very promising advancements that could improve compression to enhance on-chain scaling. And technology will undoubtedly improve. But as this is an issue of scaling being worked on very intently to come up with a solution, calling it a ""scaling problem"" is apt. The recent 2MB/8MB ""scaling problem"" though, is certainly more a political issue than a technical one.";10;6;False;chuckymcgee;dqig84l;"There never was a ""scaling problem.""

Are the mining computers not guessing numbers at random to perform the work that is required by the system (I.e. proof of work)?

The current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale.  That would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server.

**By the time Bitcoin reach that stage everyone will be streaming 20G 4k video from netflix/youtube**, and Bitcoin's bandwidth will only be at most 5% of that.

And who's going to handle all that bandwidth off-chain? A few ""LN hubs""? Well then LN hubs are an even bigger centralization choke point easily prone to government regulations and censorship.

Stop talking bullshit and stop pretending bandwidth requirement will disappear off chain, and stop pretending network infrastructure will stay the same, stop pretending storage technology will stay the same, stop pretending processing cost will stay the same.

OK, we need to do a little Bitcoin basics here.

Solving the computationally-intensive problem has nothing whatsoever to do with how many transactions are accepted into a block.

The mining puzzle is intended to force the miner who creates a block to expend a certain amount of energy.  This inbuilt cost ""keeps him honest.""  He has to spend that same energy to mine the next block whether that block is 1MB or 1GB.  The energy is expended in solving the puzzle.  The cost to solve the puzzle is based on the amount of competing miners all trying to solve it, which is in turn a function of the price of the bitcoins they are competing for.

The reason there are transactions in the mempool is because Bitcoin Core has not removed the temporary 1MB anti-flooding limit that Satoshi put in early on and [showed how to raise here in 2010](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1347.msg15366#msg15366).

"Well, thank you for clearing up some of my misconceptions about Lightning Network.  I've only been into crypto for a couple months, so your patience is appreciated!  The topology and its ramifications was something not entirely clear to me; the fact that the network is a chain of 1-to-1 channels definitely obviates most of my initial objections.  There are a few things I'm still unclear on, however, and a non-security-related quibble.

1. I'm not sure I understand how transactions propagate through the network.  Keeping it to just `A`⇆
`B`⇆`C`, `A` wants to send funds to `C`.  `A` wants to send more funds than what `B` committed to the channel it opened with `C`; is it possible for `A`'s funds to go through?  If so, how?  Does it require `B` receiving value from `A`, broadcasting a new transaction to the blockchain to settle that, then broadcasting a new transaction to increase the committed funds to the channel between `B` and `C`?  Does `B` simply request `C` sign a transaction that's greater than the amount `B` opened the channel with?  Or is `B` somehow a passive party between the two, and the transaction passes through without `B` signing anything?  

2. [According to this,](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Lightning_Network) it sounds like ""rebalancing"" allows parties to change their balance on the channel without broadcasting a new opening transaction to the blockchain.  That seems fairly necessary for this to work as a scaling solution; if I opened a channel to, say, Netflix, I wouldn't open it with a balance large enough to cover every payment I will ever make to them, so unless I wanted to over-fund the channel or close and reopen after every transaction, I have to be able to rebalance and add funds.  Since the blockchain doesn't know about that rebalancing, couldn't I broadcast the original closing transaction and only be out the funds I originally committed?

3. It still seems like there's more opportunities for failure here than with normal on-chain transactions.  If a channel is not properly funded, then a malicious actor can still get away with spending less than they should have, so there's an onus on the recipient to ensure the channel is opened with enough funds from the payer (right?).  If a channel is closed by an uncooperative payer, the recipient must broadcast the remedial transaction within a certain timeframe, or it times out and they lose funds.  For a very active node, wouldn't those broadcasts need to be automated or outsourced, as there'd be too much to track individually? Either option (automation or outsourcing) seems to require more trust than your average on-chain transaction, unless there's some way to decentralize it.  Outsourcing will also add cost, right? And automation may not be totally reliable.  These all seem like compromises/risks that wouldn't exist with other scaling methods.

4. Quibble: this approach seems to entail a lot more complexity than on-chain transactions.  Every channel opens with a contract, so there is now more user responsibility to scrutinize the channel-opening contracts.  Goods or service providers can refuse to receive payments outside of preferred channels, and sufficient demand can lead to users accepting opening contracts with very unfavorable terms that leave them exposed to more risk than they otherwise would be.  Or is there something that could prevent that?

And lastly:
>Actually, I believe to a core client, it's not technically valid. So yes, the miner is propagating a block with an invalid transaction in it.

Right, but again, this requires Core clients to make up the majority of the network, doesn't it?  To a non-Core client, they could see it as just an ""anyone-can-spend"" transaction and treat it accordingly.  So as long as SegWit-enabled clients are a minority, doesn't that make SegWit transactions more risky?

"It's a shame your original comment is getting down voted. 

Earlier, I was not disagreeing with you. I was pointing out confirmation security is provided by knowing the chain can not be attacked by re-organization, 51% attack, etc. What gives a block security is the number of hashes ""in"" the blocks that follow the block with your transaction in it.

"No my other argument is that miners lose money by mining blocks without the witness. Because they won't be able to spend their new bitcoin since no node will accept them. In fact it's advantageous to check other miners blocks because if it's invalid you still have a chance of mining a valid block.

The only way to circumvent this is to get a majority of miners to stop mining segwit transactions but if you have a majority of mining power you essentially own the bitcoin system anyway.

The attack is purely theoretical.

"It's pretty easy to figure out for someone with half a brain. But you seem some kind of nitwit so i'll lay it out for you:

For starters Core stunted Bitcoin's growth in order to please their investors (they founded Blockstream for that).

[Satoshi Nakamoto: ""Bitcoin can scale larger than the Visa Network""](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1391350.0)

Bitcoin was always supposed to scale on-chain by just removing the temporary small block size limit.

"> Right now it's more of an admirable ideological statement against Blockstream's corruption than anything else.

Haha disagree completely. It has the mining infrastructure, the distribution, same network since sharing genesis block, higher capacity than other coins like ETH, the backing of whales and OG bitcoiners, super solid devs like Peter Rizun, etc. 

What does LTC have...Segwit and good boy Charlie Lee. So dead in the water in terms of being competitive on chain. 

ETH is much more of a contender...however ETH has pretty bad scaling issues too and much less capacity than BCH so BCH wins there too. 

XMR is a strong contender which I also support but it still cant take the cake due to scaling issues and fees. 


So no, there really isn't a competitive solution out there like BCH at all.

The problem now is that we have a coin that’s different from the original project and vision called “Bitcoin Core” but it’s still “Bitcoin for short” and keeps the “BTC” like the original, and the other that’s clearly closer to Satoshi’s idea but has a different name that makes it look like another alt coin. On top of that, Bitcoin Core is the one that’s breaking all walls in terms of price and the one appearing in the news. When people who don’t know anything about crypto want in and go looking for “that Bitcoin thingy that’s making everyone rich”, they’ll look for the one that’s $10,000 and will think the other that’s also called Bitcoin but costs $1,600 must be a scam or something different, but definitely not the real Bitcoin. ;0;0;False;quirotate;dqhb7lf;Cryptonator just decided to rename Bitcoin Cash to Bcash.

"First of all, when you use the term ""shitcoins"" for everything that isn't Bitcoin, you show yourself as being a crazed zealot, not a reasonable person to debate with. Many of the coins are in fact amazing and have their own use cases that are more compelling than merely using them to buy things with.

Second, the reason Bitcoin Cash exists is expressly because people became disgusted with what Bitcoin Core is doing to the once proud Bitcoin. Segwit, small blocks, corporate takovers with side channels, no real progress made on a technical level in *three years* worth of trying to get the Core development team to stop being damned near autistic in their level of intransigence... people who want to see Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as a whole to continue succeeding finally realized there was just one way out and that was to run a proper Bitcoin as a fork until people realize that BTC is not viable as it stands.

If a company were to use bcash instead of Bitcoin Cash automatically they are doing it to antagonise the coin holder and clearly it is a hostile approach. Don't you think that's a little bit of an overreaction?

"See, that's the problem most BTC long term lovers have with some elements of this sub, the **desire** to cause confusion for newbies. I think I speak for the entire community of BTC supporters if I say that no-one has a problem with BCH/Bitcoin Cash/Bcash, whatever you prefer to call it. What we DO have a problem with, though, is the subverted attempt to sabotage the name - Bitcoin. And to add to the confusion, this small minority of people will refer to it as Bitcoin Core/Bitcoin SegWit/Bcore.

Make no mistake, there's only one Bitcoin and that's the one valued at $10k, linked to the one blockchain which is compatible with all the transactions from the very beginning. Bitcoin is Bitcoin.

Bitcoin Cash is not that coin. It is not compatible on the Bitcoin blockchain, and it never will be, which is why it is not Bitcoin. It's spin off, based on a different view on scaling. Fair enough, it's great that we can part ways by means of a simple fork, but it's not Bitcoin.

Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Diamond and possibly Bitcoin Silver are yet different coins. More hard forks and new Bitcoin clones.

"Yea, ""soft fork"" was a pretty clever bit of phrasing. 

Segwit isn't even slightly backwards compatible. It's a completely new transaction protocol overlayed on the Bitcoin network in such a way as to trick older nodes into relaying the new protocol without understanding it at all.

If you sent a segwit transaction on the 2015 Bitcoin network, it would be a race to see who could spend your ""anyone can spend"" transaction first. Making segwit actually function as expected required a successful 51% attack to change the protocol while pretending to the remaining nodes that they were still meaningful participants in the now hijacked Bitcoin network.

"You have to remember, we're trying to sell bitcoin as a currency to people who don't know the technical details. Having two things that are very different (non-compatible forks) can really easily lead to confusion:

""I have bitcoin, why doesn't it work?""

""You have Bitcoin Cash.""

""Isn't that the same thing?""

... Because god forbid you have two technologies with the same name that don't work with each other. I'm sure there are plenty of stories like this at r/talesfromtechsupport

"No. Theoretically, Bitcoin will _not_ have any significant value if it is only used as a ""store of value."" Its value is determined by people's willingness to buy and sell it on the market. If the majority of Bitcoin is held in wallets and hardly ever spent, there is nothing to back its value and it could become extremely volatile.";1;1;False;AGausmann;dqiios6;Cryptonator just decided to rename Bitcoin Cash to Bcash.

Still don’t see it. Not everyone uses Reddit and will be fooled by the bcash subreddit. Not everyone is going to listen to core and believe what they are saying and likewise with what you are saying.

"Did you watch the same video? John was waving his hands around doing that AFTER Roger spat the dummy and flipped him off. Would you just sit there and smile, take it like a bitch if someone (Verr) was trying to put you down cause you earn less money and flipping you off whilst crying about something he does himself? They were both immature but to only mention John is obviously bias! The whole interview was a shit show cluster fuck with both of them to blame but in my opinion it was mostly Roger and he's attitude that caused this. Is it not Hypocritical to complain about a name being butchered and then go and call Bitcoin: Bitcoin core, Bitcoin Segwit and Bitcoin Legacy. I rarely here Roger refer to BItcoin by it's true name without adding something like segwit/core/legacy. Furthermore, how is b-cash offensive? Is it offensive to say I spend AUD? It's real name is the Australian dollar but you don't hear people complaining. Lets be honest, EVERYONE ABBREVIATES and it isn't meant to be offensive. Saying less syllable's whilst saying enough for anyone to understand what you are referring to is faster and more efficient and who likes wasting time? John was saying b-cash before Roger even said anything, habit is habit and after calling something a certain way for a while, it's not as easy to suddenly start naming it differently and they way Roger went about it was demanding, not polite like he claimed. 

Roger is not a developer so why should he even have a say in Bitcoin Development? Do you think an early investor in Apple with no relevant expertise or technical skills should changed the OS code? LOL your B-trash (now that is an offensive abbreviation) developers are so good you've already had to fork it to change your full on retard algorithm for difficulty adjustment. Great Devs over there hey! How can people support such a hipocrite that (seen in this video) clearly thinks he is better than anyone who doesn't have or earn as much money as him. Money does not make a person better because they have it. The dumbest, meanest, most selfish person in the world can become a millionaire in the right circumstances.
