How dense am I? Not at all, I think. I made a sound wager. Settle at the end of the year. I already told you I'm not interested in ETH I want BTC. There are many ways to perform the wager, strangely you'd only accept one you know I won't. Gee, wonder why? It's always such a mystery when someone won't put their money where their mouth is. Some would say that's a sign of a coward or someone who doesn't have the courage of their convictions, but, hey, you know, I don't believe such slander. Surely there is another reason why you wouldn't simply make a wager and honor it later.;1;1;False;DeucesCracked;dtcvm6q;"Starbucks CEO Wants Crypto.

">If you want to give me $500 in ETH now, feel free. I'll accept free money any time you want. But your refusal is a clear indication you don't actually believe what you say.

...how dense are you?

Alright , I will explain it slowly: to accept that wager I would want a multisig account with a trusted party, therefor I would basically lock up 500$ now to possibly win 500$, IF btc/eth flips. But, if it flips, and I would buy 500$ of ETH right now at current marketprice, I would also make about +500$. But if the flippening does not happen, then in case 1 I would lose 500$, whereas in case 2 I would still have the 500$. Assuming 50/50 odds, case 1 has an EV of 0, case 2 of about 250$. 

The problem is not that I do not think it will happen, the problem is that the market gives me a LOT better odds to make that bet.

Please tell me you understand this, if you are too stupid to understand basic principles (which I now explained multiple times) based of 5th grade math, then I am just completely wasting my time in talking to you.

Nope, not a joke. This is how currencies become currencies. Bitcoin is forging ahead, all others are falling behind except Ethereum which is finding novel use cases in Canadian executive and legislative processes. First it was used for weed and smuggling and all that. Then fraud. Then pizza. Now nations take notice. You think this is the first or only deal done in Bitcoin like this? You understand the significance of it being used as a legitimate currency to circumvent global banking for huge deals? You maybe understand ... you can see it now... yes quite clearly that now Bitcoin's blockchain value just surged by the value of the entire wheat trade between Russia and Turkey because now Turkey can buy wheat Russian wheat with Bitcoin... yeeees, noooow you understand.

Think about it. A currency is worth the market it operates in. The CAD is worth about 80 cents. Fine. Vendors in the USA don't accept it. If people in the USA simply refused to exchange it for USD then in the USA the value of CAD would be nil because you couldn't by anything with it. The price would plummet because it would only be valuable to cross border traders.

I follow this sub mostly because they are very good at criticizing BTC. While the BCH community is sometimes a little petty or biased (like any community can be at times), more often they bring up real issues with the BTC network and team.

This is interesting and I think that LN may have good applications elsewhere. Ironically, it may be suitable for something like BCH in the future. As a BCH supporter does that make me a hypocrite? Maybe, maybe not. As I said before, I think LN is a cool idea. If you look at some of my other posts I've given it credit as being a micropayment system that does make sense. I don't think it's the silver bullet, so to say, and therefore I don't think it will solve BTC's issue of capacity expansion.  
  
>  Centralisation FUD is a misnomer because it is a dynamic network with very low entry costs to become an economic participan ANDt multi hubs does not make for centralisation.  
  
This is not FUD, this is just a discussion on the merits of a technical solution.  We are early adopters and we should be discussing how to make the system better as a whole for the benefit of all users.  It is healthy to have discussions, and it is normal for people to have differing opinions.  BTC and BCH both have solutions and no one knows which one, if either, will be adopted.  
  
For the issue of centralization I can only think of bitcoin usage as myself and others I know would use it.  I do not see myself, as a bitcoin user, opening and maintaining various channels to various entities.  If I own 10BTC, and my options are:

1. Open 10 channels, each of which I may commit 1BTC to, or
1. Open 1 channel, and commit 10BTC

As a user option #2 seems much more attractive to me.  It is less complex, I must only maintain one channel.  It is cheaper, I must only pay L1 fees to open and close one channel.  It is more convenient, I have the full 10BTC to commit to transactions.  
  
It is true there are users who will want to use LN as intended, opening many channels and distributing their transactions around the network.  I feel like it is also true that most users, being they want to get the most 'bang for their buck', will simply use one channel, and that channel will likely end up being with a hub that can fund it and that has many connections to other hubs - in other words, a centralized and consolidated service.  
  
Time will tell, but we should not be surprised to see this.

While this is a valid argument, I am not sure why it has been so easily accepted as truth. There is no proof whatsoever, and at this stage it is all conjecture. There are also a number of arguments against this happening, the most valid of which may be that the users of LN may want to ensure that it doesn't become what r/btc say it will become. That is quite powerful motivation. 

The only real life scenario similar to LN is the proliferation of the world wide web. If you were to look at the graph of the www, you would see that it is pretty decentralised, and this was an emergent graph without economic incentives (at least not as obvious as those in the LN). 

If the incentives are matched to motivations of users, you might be surprised to see what type of graph emerges. Not to mention that the free market will actually decide the shape and magnitude of the graph (as apposed to any external influence - which is what this sub thinks).

I feel like LN is a great idea, but if we project out the likely path that it will take it DOES seem to suggest that a large portion of the LN nodes will consolidate to operators who can draw in users, open massive amounts of channels, and who own an control a large amount of BTC to fund uplink channels. The long term road map for LN is absolutely no doubt lead to centralization. Users will want to open the least amount of channels possible, because you must pay L1 fees to open but also because you must lock BTC in the channel during the lifetime of it. It makes sense for users to open only one channel to a well connected and funded hub. So while yes, LN is a cool idea, and yes LN may work, LN seems likely to position BTC to abandon its original intentions of being a decentralized and free system. These original ideas are really what BCH is trying to maintain.

No. You seem to be describing Bitcoin Cash (BCH). bcash is a term made up by a group called dragons den, to drop the word bitcoin.

If you want my honest opinion, though, I think that the anti-BCH sentiment comes from people who are so deeply invested with money they can't lose into BTC that their reptile brains take over and foam at the mouth defending BTC (case in point, you attacking me for no reason).  I think the entire Bitcoin ecosystem is fucked right now and I'm just going to avoid both until a winner emerges or a savings/chequeing account system between the two arises.";2;0;False;Riiiiiiiiiiiiiiip;dtdrh9w;Trolls be like;7tkmeu;https://i.redd.it/9qvw72ucntc01.jpg

I'm not sure, but does BCH already have colored coins like the ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum block chain? If so, I'd argue that Ethereum still has a first-mover advantage and widespread adoption with hundreds of different tokens issued based on the Ethereum block chain.
