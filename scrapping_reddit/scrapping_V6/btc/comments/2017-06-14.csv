"Wut?

It's impossible for SegWit2x to lock in before August 1st because the code itself requires a full 2016 block period of time with 80+% support in order to lock in.

If BTC1 sticks to their current schedule and begins SegWit2x signaling on 21 July, the absolute soonest they could lock in the forks would be on 4 August -- which is obviously 3 days after the UAHF and BIP148 nonsense kicks off.

I have no idea what the rest of your post was trying to say. I don't support the BIP148 nonsense at all, and I've said as much in both subs.

If they begin signaling on 21 July, even with an instant 80% mining support (which is extremely unlikely), the soonest they can possibly lock in the SegWit2x forks is ~4 August, and activation of the SegWit softfork would not occur until ~18 August (after yet another 2016 block period).

Highly speculative and there is no evidence of this. In the article he says he wants Segwit2x. On Garzik's github there is a quote of him saying he's fine with Segwit2x permanently disabling covert ASICBOOST.

He's providing a competing chain so users can vote with their feet. Liberty. Sorry we don't want to all go along with UASF co-opting of the network. Some of us disagree with this. UAHF will have Segwit, Rootstock, Schnorr, Lightning, all the goodies, but it will also have a block size increase.

"> Thus miners not making segwitx2 compatible with 148 is malicious attempt to derail and postpone segwit breaking what they already agreed to.

Brain is turning to mush by this point so correct me if I'm wrong. Isn't it possible for Segwit2x to be a success, signal on the appropriate bit for Segwit2x, and then still have UASF activate a few days later using the underlying p2p network? If UASF immediately activates Segwit they would actually need to implement Segwit2x compatibility and not the other way around.

2 factors to consider. 

1) Because of variance, with only 25% hashrate the legacy chain has an unacceptably high risk of regorging - 11% unless the fork to prevent this and by HF they will instantly be banned by 96% of the network 

2) The legacy chain has an asymmetric advantage due to the risks of the mainchain attacking it makes their own chain susceptible to attacks or reorgs (even after they HF) thus the minority chain need only have 25% hashrate to be secure 

Keep in mind that with mining , the profitability of any given chain isn't depended upon merely hashrate but market demand as seen here - http://coinwarz.com/  thus even with a very high difficulty the minority chain can become more profitable as many dump their jihan coins in favor of the fork coins.

In many respects, American farming practices are an outlier. The market for American agricultural products (inputs and outputs) is distorted (eg. insanely cheap fertilizer and pesticides like Roundup that do not price in negative externalities in the production process, instead exporting this pollution to less regulated places. Why deal with harsh EPA regulations when you can just make your glyphosate at filthy Chinese factories and ship it over?

It is too short of a timeframe and you can look at historical node upgrades to see that far over 75% of the network will ban this HF even if they get many nodes like yours to quickly upgrade. Additionally , people upgrade much faster with core as they trust these specialists all who oppose segwit2x and jihans HF making convincing the network to accept a rushed , unsupported, lack of  peer reviewed HF even more of a tough sale for them. 

>This is going to hurt that chain because it will become unusable. 

We don't need to use the UASf chain at all(I can split the coins without a UASF tx) , and can wait a very long time if need be, because after all we can always process txs on the legacy chain (placing more downward pressure on it due to those txs trading legacy btc for fiat) or simply use fiat. 

>you cannot prove what the community really wants

Of course I cannot, nor do I claim to , I can only take a principled and logical stand and follow the fork which doesn't have the PoW exploit, doesn't have hostile miners , and follows my principles as to what I want bitcoin to Be. IF this doesn't have the economic majority and I eventually need to consider it an altcoin, than so be it , I am perfectly happy for this possibility.

Monsanto is able to profit by using the government's threat of violence (pay a fine or go to jail for using *your own seed*).

In a truly free market, you don't go to jail for something like this. Seeds and genetic material related to food shouldn't be patentable in a world where 25,000 children die every day. 

Monsanto should be free to sell their products, they should even be able to stop others from selling their products. 

But they shouldn't be allowed to get the government to throw farmers in jail because some of their corn has 'their' DNA.

"After some more thinking, I'm even more sure this is all overreaction.

If segwit2x is deployed as planned, and starts signalling on July21, with 80% hashrate, there is no chance of a chain split.

There will be some bip148 enforcing miner, even if with almost negligible hashrate. But can that miner really split the chain?

Say it gets 'lucky' and finds a block with its miniscule hashrate. All other miners extend on that block. If segwit2x has 80% hashrate, most of new blocks will signal segwit.

A bip148 miner must be so lucky, to find a block every time a non-segwit signaling miner finds one, and orphan it with its block. What's the probability of this? Practically None.

Even if bip148 has 5%, what can it do? Orphan a block or two of the remaining 15% non-segwit signalling miners.

If bip148 has 20%? Funny. Then all miners are extending the same chain, because everybody is mining segwit-signaling blocks!

This is what Bitmain means with 'segwit2x activates'.

"This is really insane. My hope is that Bitmain had not used the term 'activate' segwit2x right, but meant 'starts signalling' instead. Because when segwit2x starts signaling, those blocks will be compatible with bip148 (segwit bit set).

"> I do not wish to see Bitmain have any power over development,

Actually it's the whole Bitcoin community who is creating new development to replace the corrupt Core. Bitmain is one of them. So corrupt Core attacks Bitmain, Coinbase, Bitpay, like crazy.

Don't worry, Blockstream has already set a precedent that we won't allow any company to control the development again.

But [as I said before](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6h2wqx/the_reckless_censorship_in_rbitcoin_not_only/), it has been proven impossible that ""no company has any power over development"". Gavin thought we could be no-politics, so he was launched a coup against by Wladimir and BS paid shills. Their BS party has set up, and one-party dictatorship abhors politics. A country without any party is actually one-party dictatorship, or emperor.


So it's good to see many companies have power balance in development.

> I do not wish to see Bitmain have any power over development,


What about all the calls for Bitmain to step up and start funding development....


>  while simultaneously controlling the most hashpower and the entire ASIC market.


Controlling the most hash power means you are the **most invested** ie harder to just walk away do you not believe in the basic incentives that Satoshi introduced?


Much higher price would make ASIC manufacture far more interesting to large concerns - Samsung Intel maybe.....


I have seen nothing to make me believe Bitmain doesn't act in Bitcoins best interest and hence my best interest. I cannot say that for other party's. 


* Stayed with Hong Kong Consensus far past obvious Core devs reneging, and lukes 300kB & 1MB in 2024 slap in the face.

* Happy to activate SegWit as is, despite so called loss of $100Million a year ASIC Boost advantage, [Btc1 can take a very clear stance to help to ban it if community emotion desire it](https://github.com/btc1/bitcoin/issues/8), I don't believe it is an issue see jtoomim's [post](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/66y18j/andreas_on_asic_boost_19x_profit_increase_to_the/dgn8hg0/?utm_content=permalink&utm_medium=user&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=frontpage) I am sure you have read it.

* BTC.com with strong ties to Bitmain is not [coerced](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6g1u8z/why_is_btccom_owned_by_bitmain_not_signalling_ec/) into signalling BU.

* Bitmain sells the best ASICS in the world to anyone, they don't keep them for themselves, does Bitfury do that? THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF DECENTRALIZATION.


> It absolutely sickens me that anyone would embrace such an obscene level of centralization, 


I don't see anymore centralization here than we have currently, a single dev team in thrall to one person, same hashpower distribution. 


There are 3 covert dev teams + 2 public Big Blockers + Core + others, What's more decentralized than that?

Ultimately it's only a hard fork to a fixed blocksize, something I believe you have said you wanted in the past. 


> while also supporting a 72 hour premine of the Bitmain Activated Hard Fork (BAHF).


Good luck to Bitmain, they are taking the risk of loosing out on up to $2.8Million, 


or just throwing it away


* if SegWit2x activates

* if (Hashpower > Bitmains) HF & Start Building a >1MB

* edit. if UASF gains majority Hashpower.


**All in order to help break the deadlock**. 


I thank them for that as I believe Bitcoin will be better for it. 


> Such a hard fork will instantly invalidate 60,000+ Core nodes, 


Good, 53,000 of them are just leeches on the network they don't join in with consensus as they don't have open ports so don't propagate blocks, that is why people have 1TB monthly Bandwidth issues because of these misguided leeches.


> The entire network would be instantly reduced to the ~700 BU and Classic nodes, and we all know how flimsy their code is.


Yes a concern, my heart dropped when they were shown to have issues when attacked. 

You are making the assumption **all** Core nodes **won't** move to support UAHF not sure about this. 

How many nodes do we need?


You have [said](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6h1wpr/segwit2x_a_summary/divkuk5/) that you manage 6 nodes, will you let them follow a shorter chain? risking loss for the businesses they protect. This will be interesting, talk is cheap belcher, bitusher etc said they will dump their coins, but nobody likes to loose money, **That's Nakamoto Consensus**, miners do something you really don't like sell your coins.


> It's all pretty insane actually, and I honestly can't fathom a world where this would be considered acceptable by reasonably intelligent computer scientists and genuine crypto nerds.


Once again it is a HF to 8MB with a softlimit of 2MB + Quadratic Hash Mitigation, almost everybody wanted something like this 2+ years ago but saw it as a can kick. Adams 2 4 8, Peter Wuillie 100MB blocks Even Greg was not totally against Adaptive Blocksize with a hard ceiling. 


> The only thing that gives me hope is that I don't believe Bitmain has the hashpower to pull off this coup.


He is giving you the HF you have said you want ( let me know if you don't think HF to bigger blocksize is a good idea ) and your using the sort of rhetoric that Adam used circa Bitcoin Classic/XT demonizing the opposition.


I personally hope he does have the hashpower but on who's side is the Economic Majority I don't know hopefully we will find out.


> I sincerely hope I'm correct in that assessment, or this entire experiment is totally and completely fucked.


Bitcoin survived 


* MtGox.


* a fall from $1200 to $160 over 2 years


* Numerous Scammers


* Ghash io


* $100 Million Bitfinex hack.


* $5+ fees while still in the bootstrap phase, Bank the unbanked, no chance!


* And hopefully the flippening.


* In fact [134](https://99bitcoins.com/bitcoinobituaries/) times till now.


I am uncertain about the future but to me this is the best news I have had all year. 


LN won't deliver in any meaningful time frame, bip141? SegWit Activation will just entrench TPTB ->  cutting the nuts of all Big Block Implementations leading to 1MB for ever, did someone say extension blocks.

Jeezus.. just when you give up hope.. Nakamoto consensus saves the day.  I think if this succeeds and/or we survive CoreStream's attacks.. bitcoin will come out the other side far stronger and far more flexible.  Jihan's roadmap is so fucking awesome.  I agree with all of it.  It's what Satoshi would have wanted or what Gavin would be working on had he not been bamboozled out of his commit access by Core.   

**What a kickass roadmap!!**

"If it weren't for the URL I'd assume it was an attempt by the UASF supporters to make it succeed.  Let's face it, the ""economic majority"" will not upgrade to UASF in six weeks.  Most people buying into Bitcoin do not even know what UASF is. The only chance UASF has is to get miner majority.   If a lot of miners leave the current consensus by doing their own hard fork, the UASF supporters would be a step closer.

If miners really think that UASF is a threat, make an agreement with the signers of the New York agreement to not run this dangerous soft fork.  With the remaining hash rate UASF will not get enough blocks in their chain to cause serious confusion.

If Bitmain forks itself, and UASF is succesful... then the network will lose a HUGE amount of hashing power?

I know that this void will be quickly filled by those who have the means to afford new machines to mine, but still, that would be big. Why would Bitmain bet ALL OR NOTHING? It isn't rational, economically speaking.

Maybe those 12 hours they are gonna wait to release their pre mined blocks are a countermeasure in case UASF is succesful enough, so they can backtrack and accept the new standard? And if so, would they be able to use their mining hardware to take part on that upgraded chain?

"it will be up to the wallet provider. not all wallet providers are equal. 

So long as you have your private keys in your possession you will be fine. 

eg Mycelium may or may not support all 3 chains, they may or may not give users assess to there private keys.

But Mycellium uses BIP 39 so you can import your wallet into a wallet like electrum and get assess to your private keys and use them in whatever wallet you want on which ever chain you want. 

if there is a chain split there will be many tools, you are only at risk if you leave your Bitcoin in the custody of a 3rd party, like on an exchange or in a coinbase wallet. 

if you have your bitcoin in a wallet you control and they don't provide tools you want it will probably be easy to move keys to transact on which ever chain you want. 

My advice - just hodl and wait for the situation to settle. if you act too fast and don't understand replay protection you could spend the wrong coins on the wrong network. ( a trivial problem to solve, but nothing to worry about now) In all probability it'll all be FUD and there won't be a chain split.

If BIP148 gets a following they will need to do a HF PoW change to protect the network going forward.

However, *global* adoption is going to require 10GB blocks, which means that the unpruned relay nodes will need to be in data centers with petabytes of storage and high-speed internet connections.

"> If it weren't for the URL I'd assume it was an attempt by the UASF supporters to make it succeed.

Actually, I wouldn't even exclude that possibility, in a sense. Let me explain. I think it is possible that even some people in Bitmain were also supporting BIP 148/149 UASF, although not with the goal of activating SegWit by making the BIP 148/149 chain the dominant chain. Any opportunity to split the chain can be useful to a miner or mining pool operator in several ways. One goal could be to fool competitors into mining a chain that you know is not viable. If your competitors waste hash power you'll get revenue more quickly and cheaply in the next difficulty period, due to decreased difficulty; you may bankrupt your competitors; etc. The larger your pool is, the more inside information and power you have to successfully execute this kind of scam. In a scam it may even pay off to mine some blocks on a chain you know won't survive for long. I think that the BU campaign and the BIP 148 campaign have identified a lot of reckless fanatics who would spend their money and hashpower for hopeless causes or small shitcoins. It looks like there are significant incentives for someone to take advantage and scam those people. Some are in better positions to do so than others.

I can think of at least two instances of chain forks in the past which could have been motivated in similar ways.
