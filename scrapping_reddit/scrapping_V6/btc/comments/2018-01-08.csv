"> Make non-important / meaningless. Yes.

You didn't take anything away from the gif this thread is about did you? You're parroting 'open source' as some infallible good just like the Cabinet members in the gif parrot 'decentralization.' 

Third parties can't possibly know the proper supply of a good to produce and the price at which it should be sold (see the Soviet Union, 1930's America). Only businesses in the space can determine that as informed by market demand. That the third party in question, Core, is open source doesn't mean they know any better the proper amount of supply in block space needed to meat the demand for Bitcoin block space anymore so than a dictator, a bureaucrat, or a group of democratically elected officials. Giving power to an open source project to set supply is as moronic as any of the latter mentioned groups. 

> Bitcoin has a secure chain. Humble up and be happy we have it / slow down.

I never said the chain wasn't secure, just that high fees aren't a result of the security but the artificially limited block space for transactions.

Perhaps less wise and more costly of your time, you could look at just the first point, or the summary at the end. 

In any case, here it is...

> neat technology for preventing replication of a digital token

Maybe that's the result, maybe not. It certainly isn't the stated goal and stated work.  

It seems this technology was theoretically meant to be decentralized or distributed, and that in practice, it is still the stated goal. In Bitcoin's case, the idea of non-centralization is in the literal title of the white paper as ""Peer-to-Peer."" 

In the case of other coins (and non-coin blockchain and blockchain-like projects), decentralization or distributed control is sometimes the main stated goal or at least a key element baked into the tech. Sure, the stated goals could be BS and/ or the practical reality could be a miss.

In fact, there have been notable failures and many claims of failure (naming particular private entities that could have inordinate or complete control). I remain unconvinced that it has been proven unsuccessful. 

I also don't see as much as hoped of the opposite of ""throwing logic out the window"".

To prove, with logic clearly kept fully inside the window, that decentralization and distributed control technology has failed utterly and can't succeed, I will seek the same arguments made earlier in a way I can hear better (or, if I'm not failing here, made in a better way--more complete, more conclusive, possibly completely differently made).

Perhaps I'll conclusively hear of the specific private entity, one each, that controls or will control a majority of each of the top currencies, as we're on the way to private entities to eventually control all of them. 

Even without specific entities, providing reasoned, thorough logic why failure and centralized control will eventually happen would be just as good as specific examples, if it were relatively air-tight.

The comments here have attempted the latter, I think--I'm just not seeing or fully-grasping the link between the ideas and their proof. The ideas certainly do support the conclusions, if they are proven.

The conclusions seem like a valid concern. They don't seem like a certainty. I remain open minded about them, as I remain open minded about decentralization and distributed control systems.

-------------------

NOTE: The following goes into governing and regulating banks. You're a saint if you got this far, and doubly so if you continue.

As for the government, banks, motives, regulations, history, and current developments--those things I know better than some. My education, upbringing (I grew up in the world of the now-defunct NY investment bankers), some of my work, and current direct knowledge is not fully consistent with what you describe about ""thousands of years"" and where we are.

Independent of what I'm seeing with my own eyes, the general public is also aware of tremendous failures of the government to function as independent of private entities, with the interest of the people over those entities--so much so that one or ten bullet points would understate and even misstate the case. Private individuals and groups have had tremendous success with influence and even direct control over legislation and regulation. The trend lately has famously, and with very clear detail, been the opposite of the suggested governance. 

I'm claiming this is well known, even infamous. Asking me to provide examples is not necessary for disagreeing or agreeing. If you don't agree and immediately think of more than a dozen non-edgelord headlines, key platform elements, proposed laws, protests, non-crypto ponzi schemes, failures in regulations, conflicts of interest, partial or serious evidence of plutocracy, etc., then we can, with confidence and finality, agree to disagree without going any further. Your time is valuable.

I'm not saying you agree with the conclusion that we have a plutocracy or are suffering from major related trends and developments. I'm suggesting you might know what I'm thinking of when I say government not being accountable enough can't be so quickly dismissed.   

Crypto may have failed to replace this ""advancement,"" but the advancement has rolled itself back quite notably, and quite outside the recognition of edgelords. 

2008 was mainly a failure of the problems with the ""advancement"". Our further failing to intelligently advocate a reduced version of Dodd-Frank (which is a failure of grown-up edgelords) could lead to the opposition doing more than a minor dilution of it. This will lead to bankers taking major risks, with no power (or desire) by the decision makers and enforcers in the government to mitigate them.

Put simply, if people worth $300 MM could be worth $1-2 billion or more, with only a 1-in-10 chance of another 2008, they'll not only take it, they'll fight tooth-and-nail for it, with power and a great likelihood of success. 

Run that last sentence by a conservative, non-edgelord expert. Not a professor--a banker. I stake there are people who take it seriously and have (and have earned) the opportunity to present it to several top government movements (Kasich, Warren, Clinton, Trump, Sanders all). Maybe there are plenty of ideas that are crazy that are presented at the highest levels. 2017 certainly has show that to happen. Still, this one rings true to me. 

By the way, that's the optimistic and/ or interest-conflicted view of those who stand a chance to put their worth in the billions. It is my understanding the risk is much worse than 1 in 10 and that the result could be worse than 2008 by a long shot.

Overall/ TL;DR:

I haven't grasped the explanation of the parts I'm still learning about (existing failures of decentralization; logical reasons that predetermine those failures; and/ or the tech not even attempting decentralization) in such a way that it stands as supported.

The parts I do know well directly contradict the generalizations and assertions made here about governance and regulation. ";1;1;False;sophware;dsdqydw;The idiocracy of r/bitcoin;7opi7w;https://i.imgur.com/I2Rt4fQ.gifv

">If bitcoin is a system just to transfer bitcoin from wallet to wallet then its working perfectly and there's no problems.

That's actually exactly what bitcoin is. What else do you think it is?

Buying and selling bitcoin for other currencies on an exchange does not use the bitcoin network. No actual transactions are confirmed on the bitcoin blockchain when you buy or sell BTC on an exchange. On-exchange trades do not contribute to the 350,000 transactions per day, *which are coins being sent from one bitcoin address to another bitcoin address.*

If you were to buy an apple with some dogecoin, you would send some coin from your dogecoin wallet to the merchant's dogecoin wallet. This is using dogecoin as a currency.

If you owed someone $100 and you made an agreement to pay them in IOTA, you would send some coin from your IOTA wallet to their IOTA wallet. This is using IOTA as a currency.

If you wanted to give someone a gift, and sent some ether to them with a touching birthday message, you would send some coin from your ethereum wallet to their ethereum wallet. This is using ether as a currency.

A currency settles debts. Period. That's what it is.

>Actual metrics of how many merchants accept it

Not being accepted by merchants does not equal not being used at all. You wouldn't say that gold is useless because merchants don't accept it. You wouldn't say that cheeseburgers are useless because merchants don't accept it. You wouldn't say that American Express is useless because it's only accepted at 1 of the 2 grocery stores you go to. These toenail clippers are not useless because I can't open my beer with them!

The data is there and easy to interpret. If it's used one time, then it's used one time and you can't truthfully say it is ""not being used"" or it's ""useless"". It obviously was useful for that one person, one time. The word ""useful"" does not mean ""useful for you, personally"".

Bitcoin is used about 350,000 times every single day. That is a simple fact.

This post is literally just misrepresenting people's position and calling people names for disagreeing. If you're here to make sure people are saying things that are substantive, then isn't it hypocritical to be attacking me for pointing out how misleading and unsubstantial this post is?

>Are you OK with the current bitcoin (ftfy) transaction fees?

Have I come to terms with existing in a Universe that contains a cryptocurrency named ""bitcoin"" that has a 1GB block size and transaction fees of a few dozen dollars? I promise you that I am not losing a single second of sleep over it, because of all the things that are good ideas to become emotionally involved in, the monetary policy of financial instruments is not one of them.

I'm differentiating between buying and selling bitcoin as an asset with currency, and using it as a currency to buy/sell goods and services.

There's a meaningful difference between these two concepts, I don't care what words you want to use to describe these two concepts, we can use whatever words you want (i prefer ""currency"" and ""asset""), so long as we actually establish there's a meaningful difference between these two things, and have different words to describe them.

buying and selling or transferring ownership an asset doesn't make it a currency. trading for goods and services does. increased daily transactions does not prove use as currency is up when the vast majority of those transactions are on exchanges. All that shows is more people are speculating on the price and buying and selling it as an asset. Actual metrics of how many merchants accept it, and how many black markets accept it are down, not up.

 If people stopped driving cars as much and I said ""car use is down"", and you responded with ""but people are still buying and selling the same number of cars so thats not true"", we are clearly not talking about the same thing. It's a semantic game to use two different definitions of the word ""use"" and pretend that there isn't really any difference between driving a car and buying and selling a car because its all just ""using"" cars.

>How can it be used as a currency without coin being transferred wallet to wallet?

The fact using it as a currency would require moving it from wallet to wallet (which it actually doesn't if you bought things by physically handing over a pen drive with keys), doesn't mean any time it moves from wallet to wallet its being used as a currency. If its not being used as a medium of exchange its just people buying and selling it for fiat. It is what is being exchanged.

>If your grandma gave you a $100 bill for Christmas, that was her using dollars as a currency.

Just because you can transfer ownership of a currency doesn't mean anything you transfer ownership of is a currency. 

You're abstracting currency down to some abstract you can ""use"" or ""transfer"", ignoring the actual definition of currency which is a medium of exchange used to buy and sell goods and service. Just because you can ""use"" or ""transfer"" something doesn't make it a currency.

Then Bitcoin Cash has a problem because Bitcoin Core will work again like it is suppose to. But Bitcoin Core also has a problem because raising the blocksize is basically them saying: We where wrong the Bitcoin Cash developers where right. When that happens you will have two Bitcoins claiming to be Bitcoin and both of them working like Bitcoin. Will they coexist? Nobody knows. Will one die? Nobody knows. But at least both Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin will be usable and that is good for Bitcoin users. Now Bitcoin Core users that have small amounts of Bitcoin stuck can finally unstuck those.  Maybe a lot of users will not trust Bitcoin Core anymore and switch to Bitcoin Cash. It's just impossible to predict.  But it is very unlikely that after 4 years of being super stubborn about the block size limit suddenly Bitcoin Core would change it's mind. ;2;0;False;Kain_niaK;dscjwlx;The idiocracy of r/bitcoin;7opi7w;https://i.imgur.com/I2Rt4fQ.gifv

">Why do you think that? Segwit2x was rejected because it didn't have sufficient consensus. I don't ever see the blocksize changing without consensus even if the changes are merged into an active repo. 

Because there is only a single actively developed implementation on BTC and only a single person has commit access to it.  This is in direct contrast to BCH which as multiple active dev teams.  Segwit2x was called off because Jihan Wu who controls a majority of hash power decided to abandon it.  

I personally believe Jihan doesn't care about anything other than making money like any ration business man.  So he simply decided to continue to make money on BCH while also creating a huge fee market on BTC.  Lets get this clear if the Chinese miners really wanted to raise the block limit it would have happened ages ago as they control a majority of the has power.  However, if they came out and said this publicly the community would raise the block size even if the wasn't the chain with the most work.  So instead Jihan publicly calls for the block size to be raised by supporting BCH while keeping the 1MB block limit in place and reaping hundreds of millions in fees on BTC.

But most of the disproving would probably revolve around the fact that miners already need specialized hardware, so increasing block size would only add more storage to that hardware (and storage is by far the cheapest part).

"no this isn't really right

a block is a list of transactions, but bitcoin was made so these blocks would never be 'full'

the people who 'mine' the bitcoins and confirm the transactions are the ones that put the txs into blocks. So you can pay a fee on your tx, the idea is that the more you pay the more likely your transaction will be included in the block (blocks are found bout every 10 mins)

a few people took control of the code and changed how bitcoin works so that blocks would be full

previously transactions could be free and very close to it, without full blocks there is no reason to have high fees. The creator of bitcoin envisioned that in 30-40 years there would be enough people that all the small fees would may the miners

but since bitcoin was taken over the blocks have not grown like the creator of Bitcoin wanted, and so the fees are high. this is partly why people are leaving legacy bitcoin and moving to other things (like bitcoin cash for instance)";1;0;False;siir;dscb0kf;The idiocracy of r/bitcoin;7opi7w;https://i.imgur.com/I2Rt4fQ.gifv

Yes, I've heard that argument, but is clearly false when discussing an 8 MB block-size limit.  You could easily still run full nodes in your home with an 8 MB cap.  Even a 16 MB or 32 MB or 64 MB cap would *not* preclude you from running a full node, and it would have absolutely no effect on centralisation of mining nodes, so that argument falls apart.  I still have yet to hear a single rational argument from anyone as to why a block size cap increase to 8 MB would lead to centralisation at all.

Electric cars, in my opinion, are extremely revolutionary, as the impact they have on the environment are minimal, and the amount of natural resources that using these cars will preserve.

Yet the average price of these vehicles are well above the the national average.

I guess I could make a stupid example example saying a space shuttle.  Most people believe a space shuttle is revolutionary as to the discovery of things beyond our understanding.  Yet no normal person can afford one.  But this example is a little nonsense lol.

What SpaceX is doing to bring costs down through reuse, that's radical.

"Yes it was. Revolutionary means it started a movement toward a new production or new way of living. A current example is the Tesla Model S: a car that has fully autonomous capabilities and is fully electric. It is definitely revolutionary in it's design, but the price tag keeps it out of reach of most. That doesn't make it irrelevant. 

For a larger scale example, what about the nuclear powered submarines and aircraft carriers that can go for years without needing ""refueled""? That's completely inaccessible to the masses, but that doesn't mean it's not revolutionary.

There's also things like quantum computers which are vastly complicated and even more expensive. That not revolutionary? Buildings like the Burj Khalifa which are seemingly physics-defyingly tall which are built with clever new building practices? A rocket which can transport material into space and then re-land itself so it can be reused?

This is why Bitcoin Legacy will never be a world wide global money.  Bitcoin Cash can fulfill the role though.

"Just an observation.

A Segway is also a potentially game changing technology as well.... When it arrived, many very smart people thought it would mean the death of the automobile.  And it contains technologies that will certainly be used in all kinds of future products.

But the Segway was not a game changer. The game remains the same.  No cities are being reenvisioned around the Segway.

It's easy to look back at the automobile and say ""well obviously it was super innovative"" but that's because you have the luxury of judging it after 100 years of success.

"It isn't just an argumentation point either.

Using blockchain technology to make conventional banking more robust (which is the aim of projects like BTC / Lightning, and Ripple) might be where the money is going, and it might even be a societal improvement, but it's not *revolutionary* unless it can ""change the game."" Giving blockchain to banks is like giving nukes to the top superpowers *who were going to dominate regardless.*

Making *onchain* transactions widely available is what ""changes the game."" Giving everyone an onchain transaction is like giving *everyone* a nuke.

We can agree the metaphor is sketchy but I think it makes the point nicely.  You can replace ""nuke"" with ""transportation device"" and get the same result - if internal combustion had only been a way to make diesel instead of steam locomotives, then it would have not been disruptive and transformational.  What made internal combustion transformational wasn't that it enabled more efficient forms of preexisting mass transportation, but that it enabled *personal* transportation. Similarly the invention of the computer was an innovation but it took *personal* computing for it to be a revolution.

Again my point isn't that things like the moon landing aren't important, because obviously they are, but they aren't particularly *revolutionary* until they affect the way normal people live.  And that typically implies mass availability.

Revolutionary implies societally altering.  In the context of crypto, that means onchain transactions for everyone.

"Yes, but we're taking about MONEY not just some abstract innovation with no context.

If we accept as given that the world's wealth is already distributed roughly 99% to the top 1%, then it stands to reason that innovations in the field of ""money"" that simply further empower the 1% cannot be expected to be particularly ""disruptive"" or ""innovative"" as they cannot significant change the preexisting operative paradigm.  Something that CAN change the preexisting operative paradigm would be far more disruptive.

Because the world's wealth is already very very poorly distributed, we should expect real innovation in this space to be innovation that empowers the billions of disempowered not currently served.

I think an excellent example of the point you were trying to make is the Saturn rocket program. It's clear that this program had long lasting effects on humanity even though it directly touched only a relative handful of people.

That said, I'm sure you'll agree that, while landing humans on the moon was a milestone event for humanity, you'll never hear anyone really justify the program on the basis of beating the Russians onto an uninhabitable rock. Instead you'll hear about all the many many ways that the innovations required to achieve a moon landing **eventually trickled their way down to the common person.** Like the way Honda's participation in F1 racing led to it bringing race suspension technology to passenger cars.

TL;DR innovations are made more ""disruptive"" and societally impactful by their utility to common people.

"BTC is useless ever since LTC and ETH got reliable fiat pairings. I'm deep into alts and don't even hold LTC or ETH anyway, but anytime I'm buying or selling it's always in one of the two.

I guess BTC can be useful for on-exchange trades but even that is pure legacy and is losing ground to ETH and LTC as well. 

Anywhere you see info or guides about how to start trading and using an exchange you'll always see warnings about BTC being slow and the fees too high and recommending people buy in via LTC or ETH. 

To be honest it's actually surprising that BTC is still holding a value and I can only imagine it's mostly people that just don't have a clue. 

Personally I'm thinking XRB will eventually replace any purely currency coin and things like ETH will of course exist for its amazing token and smart contract platform, but beyond that there's a chance we'll start seeing a pruning of many alts since so many are just pointless forks whether or not they're scams or have quality teams. Like for example XMY and VTC have always been coins I've held and loved the communities attached to them. I just don't see a single point in their existence in a post XRB world though.

* It matters what the money is spent on. Different types of spending stimulate the development and maintenance of different types of infrastructure. If you give money directly to people, it directly stimulates infrastructure for them to live and have some quality of life. If someone instead sells a bunch of stock and buys a boat, it stimulates infrastructure to build boats. While the boat-building infrastructure has some jobs, the only way this helps people is through ""trickle-down"". ""Trickle-down"" is proven not to benefit most people in an economy where the workforce has no bargaining power due to increasing automation.

* Driving up the price of stocks makes it *harder* for smart money to do its job through investment. When tremendous amounts of money are competing for some place to generate a return, this distorts the economy in ways that are hard to measure, but are probably not helpful.

Another hope of crypto is that if the money is all crypto and mathematically accounted for, then the Evil Bankers of the Fed can't just digitally print 4 trillion more and give it to their friends, as we discovered happened during the 2008 meltdown.

As to the non-fractional bank, such things do exist, in the vaults that store gold for people. You pay an annual fee, and they only hodl your physical metals for you.

"> what would you call the national governments owning vast reserves of gold.

That type of national ""saving"" is only worth anything if you plan to buy from other countries when things get dire. This can only really work if you expect other countries to be economically healthy, and want to buy gold from you, when shit hits the fan in your country. If you're the world's largest economy like the US, such a situation is unlikely.

> you need growth, which you get from prudent investing, which are not dead assets, it IS investing in infrastructure

Investment is a risky activity that needs to be done by people who have educated opinions about what the economy needs, and who will back those opinions with money. True prudent investing is, by necessity, a specialist niche.

For the average Joe, or for the nation at large, the only type of prudent investing that can be done is to not invest at all. Just give the money to people so they'll spend it. This drives demand. Supply in itself is not sufficient.

Failing that, if you're insisting that the nation must ""invest"", then if you're lucky, people will invest in index funds (drives up stock prices) or treasury bonds (which funds government spending and raises demand &ndash; why, again, not just give money to people?). If you're not so lucky, the money goes into sub-prime mortgages, and kaboom.

When a nation tries to ""invest"", this just creates bubbles and distorts the economy, because it's all dumb money. If you're lucky, it's a relatively harmless, persistent, long-term bubble that drives up the price of stock or treasuries.";1;1;False;SushiAndWoW;dscvqj5;WARNING: Brutal scam.

"You do not understand how Blockchain works on a very basic level.

Yes you will be able to fund a knock-off Ledger. Yes it will work, you can send and receive. And no, it will not be secured. A third party can guarantee that it is stolen.

And you don't strike me as the kind of person who wants to learn something new right now. You strike me as the kind of person who wants to double down and argue something they don't know anything about.

They can easily sell you a working knock-off Ledger Wallet that has a valid private key known to the third party. It's trivial to create a minimally functional wallet that can send and receive money. There is no need for segwit. There is no need to create new private keys or actually use a key corresponding to a seed. You just have a fake device that shows fake pixels.

The knock-off does not need far more functionality than what you know a paper wallet (a piece of paper) has.

A new user won't even know how the Ledger is supposed to work. They could not distinguish the app from a forked CoPay.

You are overestimating everyone (including yourself). Yes, a majority of people would have their tingling sensors at maximum as soon as something fishy were to happen (like scratching off the seed in the last eBay scam). But a non-negligible portion wouldn't.

For fuck's sake, please stop arguing shit you know absolutely nothing about. And stop looking for holes to be able to say ""Nah but what you said there is wrong I am dismissing your argument I won this debate"". You are giving security advice online. **Don't**.

"It's about limiting your exposure. No matter the wallet you'll want a physical backup of the key. How much more exposure you add on from there is what you can change. Best is to use a seed + custom word password so even if a thief gets your physical seed list they'd still need to crack a password, making it nigh impossible.

Falling for a scam is always going to be the #1 method when it comes to losing money, crypto or fiat. A big barrier I have with crypto is how easy it is to scam or hack, and how hard it is for anyone to have any recourse. If someone stole $25k from a bank account, there's many avenues to recover it. If someone hacks $25k of Bitcoin from someone's computer, well that's $25k gone.

"I know this is late and I didn't downvote it, but I reject the premise of point 1. This thread is a historically important one, so I think it is worth adding some perspective.

Do we know that increasing the block size limit will make it harder to run a full node? 

1. BCH's average block size is currently smaller than BTCs. 
2. BTC's full mempool increases the resources needed to run a full node.
3. Moore's law may actually make it cheaper to run full nodes even if the average block size increases.

I get the argument that removing or increasing the block size limit *may* cause centralization, but no one has yet convinced me that keeping it is not also causing centralization.
