"Use Linux phone. 

Most security experts now only use Linux phones. Android Phones are for non sensitive stuff.

">Also, most Android phones haven't seen an OS security update in years. That means there are plenty of well-known methods whereby someone could hijack or compromise the phone over the network. And at that point, it doesn't matter who made the thing. If they're really that worried about national security, this issue should be fixed and phones should get timely security patches.
>I thought I lucked out when I found a 64GB/4GB Zenfone2 for $160, but the guy who was doing the Lineage OS builds called it quits, so I'm screwed again. Basically there's no point paying more than $200 for an Android phone since they are pretty much disposable. You can't get 8+ years out of them like you can a PC.

"I am not a fan of Bitcoin Cash nor of Bitcoin. I love Monero, even if I came to know every crypto through BTC. I have used it to purchase online with success but I haven't grasped completely the Blockstream vs Bitcoin Cash war. But I truly believe both have potential. Bitcoin cash is great for transactions and actual usage of the coin. Bitcoin is great to trade and invest, because it's the first and will never die, even if a mean group of programmers are leading it and censoring others posts.
I actually upvoted because you are great guy that knows how to admit his mistakes and is open minded towards new or changing things. 
I really hate the censorship by Blockstream, but I guess we have to care about our own favorite coins, our persona, our life. Hating takes you nowhere, only love will let you feel the world!
