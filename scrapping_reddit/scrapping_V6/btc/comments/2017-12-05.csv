Not assuming anything. Doesn't matter to me which one is 'best' (which is subjective). Laserdisc could be better than DVD, not my place to say. But you say:

Ignoring that it's literally the subject of controversy, that's not all that b-cash proponents say.

Bcashenistas say that b-cash is instant and cheap and perfect for making small transactions. It seems silly to keep repeating myself but, again (and again and again...) but if that's true then there's no reason for you to have said and to keep saying that lightning network will be good for, or useful for, or anything but destructive to b-cash.

Nothing at all. For all I care it could be true. If it's not true, or just a little true, then, yes, b-cash could hypothetically benefit from a lightning network.

"> Now, the BCH narrative is that only miners need to run full nodes. But if so, then only miners are verifying themselves!

That's not entirely true, because we've already seen that places like Coinbase run mulitple full nodes for many reasons, and SPV wallet-maintainers like Electrum also run full-nodes. We would also expect anyone who has a strong interest in knowing what their balances are immediately, without wanting to trust others, to run full nodes, such as companies that take payments.

I don't know where you got this idea that BCHers said only miners would run full nodes, but even if that were the case, that would still likely be workable, but it's not remotely the case even now and more and more people would tend to run full nodes for many various reasons depending on how important it is to them to know addresses immediately or check for double-spends if they take BCH payments.

> I am not saying everyone should run a full node

But that is what the BTC people are saying, in fact they say you should be able to run a full node on a $20 Raspberry Pi computer, which is a bit ridiculous.

FWIW I'm an old hand (been involved in bitcoin since ~2010), I think the ""fee market"" is one of the worst things to have happened to bitcoin, and it wouldn't be such a big deal if it was just temporary - but all signs point toward core stonewalling any sort of block size increase (see: segwit2x) so I no longer have faith in bitcoin (core, legacy, whatever you want to call it), and that lead me to sell around 6k (that rough weekend). Not my best decision, but what kept me going through previous dips was that I always had faith that bitcoin was the best. These high fees and the lack of concern among devs (and shit like tabs, recently) gave me serious doubts, so I couldn't hold through that dip like the others.

"In 2011, Ver was already an entrepreneur and self-made multi-millionaire from his company. When he learned about Bitcoin, he sold his company and invested it into Bitcoin and Bitcoin startups. Then he worked full-time since then to promote Bitcoin. Not as many people as today, but many people in 2011 heard about Bitcoin, because Ver heard about it on a radio show. However, nobody else quit their job or sold their companies, to invest everything, including their time, into Bitcoin.

Many of the biggest Bitcoin companies were created with help from Ver.  He took huge risks by investing in Bitcoin companies in 2011. Bitpay is the biggest Bitcoin payment processor.  Blockchain dot info is the biggest provider of wallets.  Kraken is one of the biggest exchanges.  Bitcoin dot com promoted Bitcoin non-stop, even now, it is still promoting Bitcoin.  Even Venture Capital firms were not willing to invest in Bitcoin startups until recently.  Without these companies, which were promoting, servicing and accepting Bitcoin, Bitcoin would not have grown as big as it did.

When you heard about Bitcoin, did you quit your job or sell your company, invest everything into Bitcoin and work full-time on Bitcoin? If not, why not?

"I really don't get how anyone can support any crypto if these are your values. Bitcoin isn't out of the reach of governments, it's not decentralized, sure there's nodes everywhere but the mining is very fucking centralized and there needs to be a push to change that. To shut this down all they have to do is go after the mines in Iceland and China. Things halt to a crawl. It's really that easy. 

This is why bch isn't the answer either. I am a miner, I am involved in some very large operations and I love bch, but not for the same stupid reasons I read here. I love it because I can switch my asics from btc to bch once it's more profitable, just like I do with my gpu rigs. Then once we switch back over, I have all these stupid high fees on btc to go collect. Just look at the rewards for mining during the bch attacks on bitcoin. 

BCH is no better than btc, they both have issues. Yet, anyone that is selling all their btc for bch is going to end up regretting that. BTC has the adoption and the hype. That's where all the money is going and that's why we use BCH to accumulate btc. 

Bring on more hardforks and more chances for the miners to manipulate the users, cause at the end of the day, ANYONE mining, that's all they care about. That's why anyone involved in mining is talking about bch. WE ARE FORCED too by bitmain if we want asics.

"You're absolutely right.  Original BTC until 2013 had a 500kb - 700kb limit. Then it became 1MB during the 2013 Hard Fork.  Now as of 2017 it is 4mb of block weight.

The notion that satoshi would play fast and loose with block size is absurd.   And usually the response is to quote satoshi saying ""it can be phased in..."", that means nothing in 2017 when we have RSK, LN, MAST, Schnorr, and the other things that any *engineer* would take into account when making a decision about capacity.

BUT, the fees exist, I understand that full blocks didn’t exist until ‘13, and I haven’t seen the source that combines 1mb requirement WITH dealing with the network volume that’s caused the fee spike, and/or sources that reconcile the 1mb block security argument and how that same approach to sec is maintained with LT.

"The main thing that holds me back from knowing whats what is the debate on block size and technological limitations, that either already exist or will come about relatively soon with mass adoption.

I'm not savvy enough to know if the block size debate has been hijacked by either side or who has the market's best intentions in mind.. I don't know whether it's a legitimate worry or if the solutions championed by either side are all self serving.

As a newcomer, I can see how the decision to fork instead of continuing debate was a way forward, but now it seems as if the crypto scene is at war with itself.

I'm also using coinbase and don't know if I'm really getting a true feel for what the state of fees and transaction times is right now. I do know that it cost me about $4 in fees on coinbase to send .002 BTC over this weekend.

"The article is either misleading or plain wrong depending how you look at it.

Writing a transaction to a blockchain does not quantify triple entry accounting.

However writing a transaction to a blockchain AND requiring that transaction to be verified accross all copies (nodes) of the chain before it becomes a valid transaction is triple entry accounting.

This is exactly what Bitcoin is.

The article is leading the reader to assume Bitcoin does not have triple entry accounting because using a blockchain doesn't automatically equal triple entry accounting.

Verification of signatures by all nodes for every transaction is the other half.  That is Bitcoin.  That is triple entry accounting.

"Firstly, I've heard a lot of bad stories. Look at their reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/bitfinex/ - A friend of mine even had >$1mm stuck on there for long time. They've also been hacked and acted shady for long time. I remember listening to a whale chat recording a couple of years ago where the owner was blaming users for a flash crash on their site because they ""kept clicking the button"" when it wasn't responding. If their site is not responding, that's their bug and their fault. Can't blame your users for that. Seems like their users always take the hit for their screw ups (when they were hacked, they forced users to take on the loss). It's basically theft.

Secondly, I've had a bad experience with them. They stopped allowing US citizens and I was holding an asset that was only tradeable on Bitfinex.

"**Invisible hand**

The invisible hand is a term used by Adam Smith to describe the unintended social benefits of individual self-interested actions. The phrase was employed by Smith with respect to income distribution (1759) and production (1776). The exact phrase is used just three times in Smith's writings, but has come to capture his notion that individuals' efforts to pursue their own interest may frequently benefit society more than if their actions were directly intending to benefit society. Smith may have come up with the two meanings of the phrase from Richard Cantillon who developed both economic applications in his model of the isolated estate.
