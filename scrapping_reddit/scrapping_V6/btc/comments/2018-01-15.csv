"people have been calling out the fake news since it began in mid December.  The fact the ""news"" of the ""ban"" kept breaking by repeatedly going viral harder than previous time with new publications mentioning it was frustrating and painful to watch.  I thought it was confirmed not getting banned before Christmas, but that last time it went super viral actually had me convinced it might actually be happening.  Probably the direct quotes and whatnot.  People need to stop taking too seriously what any individual says about coming government action if the individual does not single handedly have the authority to make it happen.  The news story in situations like this should read [Name], the [position] of [institution] says the government of [nation] is going to [whatever] but it's the <specify> that ultimately decides this and they have [not yet commented / confirmed / denied] that they are going to take this course of action.

...but sensationalist headlines get clicks, clicks generate ad revenue, and bad news is more profitable than boring news.

This is probably why China has ""banned"" crypto so many times.  I do not think that the amount of traffic these stories get or the corresponding ad revenue is trivial.

"Regulation is bad

(Edit) The reason I say it's bad is because:

Cryptos are full of a lot of irrational investors. This has attracted traders that are capitalizing on this. Because irrational investors are trading off news and emotion, volatility can be wild. Traders are capitalizing on this behaviour, and in doing so I believe are preventing massive losses by buying up crypto when some news story (such as this news last week) breaks.

Regulation is what these traders are most worried about, not news stories. Regulation means it may be harder for them to implement their strategies. I don't think regulation will stop irrational investors from being irrational but it may hamper other traders.

"It's considerably better than a blanket ban. 

Crypto will see a ton of pushback. It does things that will seriously hurt banks even in the relatively short term, and pulverize them long term. 

For instance, remittances. Some poor overworked house slave in America wants to send some money back to her birth country to help the remaining family there and winds up paying 20% in fees and waiting a week. 

Crypto? Send for under a cent and it's there in seconds with BCH. The only hard part is finding someone to buy the BCH for fiat at the destination. But with enough adoption, people can trade crypto for crypto in retail also, which means banks are no longer useful for anything. 

The banks currently for all intents and purposes own all the politicians. They'll start making serious noise when they realize the FUD campaign of ""oh Bitcoin is a bubble it's going to crash don't say you weren't warned"" don't work.";6;0;False;cr0ft;dspkmz9;BREAKING NEWS: South Korean Government confirms NO CRYPTO BAN.

The transition will occur in this way, there is no other better way, because if they crackdown everything, people won't be able to put part of their fiat in crypto. So let them regulate.

"**Ad hominem**

Ad hominem (Latin for ""to the man"" or ""to the person""), short for argumentum ad hominem, is a fallacious argumentative strategy whereby an argument is rebutted by attacking the character, motive, or other attribute of the person making the argument, or persons associated with the argument, rather than attacking the substance of the argument itself.

However, its original meaning was an argument ""calculated to appeal to the person addressed more than to impartial reason"".

Fallacious ad hominem reasoning is categorized as an informal fallacy, more precisely as a genetic fallacy, a subcategory of fallacies of irrelevance.

"Takes a while before everybody realized that with buying Bitcoin they bought hot air. Without utility Bitcoin itself is useless. Utility means usage and for usage you need users. Bitcoin core is doing a wonderfull job at getting angry at their own users. They say: you are using it wrong. But no, they corrupted what was build right. Bitcoin Cash is no corrupted and because it is Bitcoin it also has the network effect. And it has the hash power (20%) which means that all other crypto can be attacked easier then Bitcoin Cash because it's hash power is massive compared to the other crypto. Using a different algo means that more people can mine if very easy it also means that the goverment just needs to confiscate enough GPU's that have already been build to attack those coins that use a differernt algo. But the process of designing a ASIC chip is not very easy and you need the righ equipment. That equipment is primarily in China. This makes it very hard for western powers to attack it. Therefore they have bet on undermining Bitcoin by trying to turn it in to banks 2.0. But they failed as this community is proving every day a little more then the day before.

"In Bitcoin, assuming you are using a decent wallet software, you end up with one ore more different addresses each time you transact, which makes it relatively difficult for an outsider to track your transactions. Wallets also can (or at least should) select outputs smartly in order to increase privacy.

Since every Bitcoin transaction is separate and has to be signed in order to be spent, using a different address to receive each transaction and using a change address (that is different than ones used in the input transactions) does not change the cost of using the system at all. So it is a natural default for all users, which I think is very important.

I am not an expert, but AFAICT trying to emulate this for Ethereum accounts would be a mess. In turn, more advanced privacy features will be possible there, but I am guessing it is going to be much more costly than the simple transaction.

I don't see the similarity at all.

Assuming PoS works as intended, it's nearly impossible to perform a >50% attack. You'd have to buy too many coins, raising the price while you do it. In PoW it would be possible for someone with lots of money to burn (think government). That's why PoS is more secure.
