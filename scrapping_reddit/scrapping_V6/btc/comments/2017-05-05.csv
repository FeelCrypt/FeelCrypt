"I'm saying without a majority, more strategy is needed to create a split.

The assumption is that miners are rational, which leads to a majority rule outcome, where the minority loses when committing effort against the grain.

But in reality some miners are irrational, and willing to mine for ideological reasons at an economic loss, so a chain split is possible.

Therefore the real battle is between the two groups of irrational miners on each side of the issue.  The rest will just go along for the ride on the chain that provides an economic incentive.

Just to trying to clarify - so you're saying that, because there is no real long term monetary incentive here, it simply won't happen, because miners would have to commit to mining a chain that, without others joining them in doing so, will eventually end up being a waste of computational power and time, because *other* miners have no incentive to follow them in mining that chain, and even if such a fee were somehow split (as I saw someone explaining earlier), it would eventually become so negligible an amount, that the risk of mining a chain that might be orphaned in the future would outweigh that reward?

We (probably) do need on-chain scaling, but not for censorship resistance. Bigger blocks *will* have a centralizing effect.

Fair point. What I meant is that I think the attitude of ""this is a meritocracy, people skills don't matter the better tech will win in the end"" is really harmful here. These are very complex and confusing issues, and trolling on all sides just makes it hard. You also have to realize that 99.9% of people can't or won't take the time to really understand these changes, so there is a definitely level of trust or faith involved. It's simply too complex, and the idea that every user runs a full node and audits the code and understands that they are totally safe is bunk. Real people don't operate that way, they need to have some faith / trust in someone (or some group).

> I know the simplicity of bigger blocks = more transactions = more users = higher price is appealing. I was in that camp.

I still am, maybe you can convince me the rest of the way. The way I see it is this: we can immediately increase block size to increase transactions (and eventually price) to continue the exponential scaling of bitcoin. This is not free, it means that it's harder for people to run nodes, so fewer people will, and more users will rely on ""trust"" in some form (but there will still be hundreds or thousands of nodes, so it's not much faith that people need). On the other hand, keep the block size as it is (or shrink it maybe?) so people can run their nodes longer. Not much of a debate to me....";1;1;False;bradfordmaster;dh6lvr5;"1.44MB!!!

SegWit is a solution for many problems. They realized they could increase blocksize as a soft fork only in the later stages. It's an added bonus. Ironically, if they hadn't touched the blocksize, SegWit would probably already be active.

And in regards to the rest of your comment that seemed to expect me to respond to challenges that weren't made:

Bigger blocks does mean more computational power, but that's not what BU does. It's not a big block protocol. It just sets the blocksize based on the market. It is in miners best interest to keep the network working, so they have zero incentive to raise the blocksize above what the full nodes can handle.

And beyond that, the computational load is really not that great, even with significantly larger blocks. Network speed is a bigger bottle neck, but for the exact same reasons you think hard drives will no longer grow in capacity, network speed will likely get much faster.

"It's not that simple.

The extra megabytes want to be transmitted again and again for bootstrapping other clients or relaying -> more network bandwidth.

Those extra megabytes also need to be verified -> more CPU usage.

Cheaper transactions will result in more transactions (not necessarily with any additional economical value, see wasteful implementations of bitcoin gambling sites in the past -- people are lazy if they can be) -> more RAM for a bigger mempool.

Any future improvement (e.g. privacy enhancements) that has a flipside of increasing transaction size might be dead on arrival if the base layer is too big.

If at any point the blockchain exceeds the size of what consumer targeted HDDs provide, it might get expensive very very fast. (E.g. with cloud storage getting more popular and compression better all the time, consumers might continue to value speed over size (see SSDs). This might make large local disks hard to sell in the future and vendors might stop producing them in huge volumes and offering them for the prices we're accustomed to.)

Let's assume the worst case in any limit. I'm very aware that a blocksize cap increase doesn't mean that the blocks would be that size.

I'm fairly sure that we are on the same side;

I want bigger blocks (in a safe phase) on-chain scaling and I want to explore 2-layer solutions (whatever that would be).

The unfortunate truth is that this community split makes us not collaborate together, with the blockade of SegWit as well as working together for a blocksize hardfork (personally I prefer a incremental over time).

"> 10MB or 32 MB blocks doesn't mean all will be full in first place

If we hardfork to 10MB or 32MB we should assume the worst case scenario. I'm very well aware that blocksizes won't instantly be 10MB if we increase the cap.

>  In second place if number of Transactions grows its only logical the blocksize have to increase. 

Sure, but I would like the number of transactions to grow in the most effective way. This might not be on-chain for every single transaction - Lightning Network and similar technologies look very interesting because it can leverage much of the burden that fullnodes have.

> And Biggerblocks doesn't mean sidechain solutions can't be developed. 

Well personally I don't think sidechains are that interesting, because of the inconvenience of moving between chains.

> Why do you need even full nodes at home? Run it in pruned mode and you're good to go forever.

Being able to independently run a fullnode to verify the blockchain is the essence of Bitcoin, once this ability doesn't exist anymore, no one cannot make sure that Bitcoin isn't being malleated. For me, making sure anyone can run a fullnode is really _really_ important.  
Edit: Oh yes agree, pruned node at home makes more sense.

> Run it in pruned mode and you're good to go forever. 

Sure, you're right. The storage constraint is partly* fixed by pruning.

\* partly because IBD (Intial Block Download) still requires a full download of the blockchain before pruning.

> run a lot nodes on 20gb vps servers in pruned mode and some full nodes on Servers with more storage. For some VPS servers i pay $1 a month to run pruned Nodes and they can keep running forever even with 32 MB Blocks.

Okay sure, servers not at home. This is not interesting for me.

> You need btw more RAM,CPU and Bandwith with smaller blocks
> You get the transactions in your mempool and they get rebroadcasted all the time as long they aren't confirmed, the Blockbuilding it self doesn't cost much resources...

I'm not sure how you can possibly claim this. Could you elaborate?
This is really a moot point, it's not like you'll rebroadcast every 10 seconds.

"Here is a thought experiment:
In the 50s, Moa instated the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Flowers_Campaign, then killed everyone that criticized the government.  Today there are many statues of Mao.

Here is the question, if you kill everyone who opposes a government - does that mean it's the kind of government that everyone likes?

What if, for example, there is a place called America.  In America people frequently cannot believe the human rights atrocities that have happened in China.

"I don't know why clueless people like you constantly ignore the facts, just to repeat the same bullshit over and over.  

First, there is a difference between *maximum* blocksize and the actual size of a block. Even if we'd increase maxsize to 8MB now, blocks would be slowly starting to grow, probably reaching 2 or 3 MB until end of year.  

Second, chainsize will be a problem in some years, yes. There are some solutions to this already discussed. The most elegant IMHO is Mimblewimble, which even has a proof-of-concept implementation as of today. Just google it or search the last week of reddit posts. I'm quite certain that it will be production ready well before any chainsize could become critical (because it has other advantages as well, like privacy).

"> Anyone who tells you otherwise has something to gain off of limiting Bitcoin's on-chain growth

Absolutely correct. We all do: censorship resistance. The only thing that makes bitcoin special. Why is the sub that heavily decries /r/bitcoin censorship not getting this?

[Roger discredits non-mining full nodes](https://twitter.com/rogerkver/status/853250894162350080) and prefers to trust miners, like Jihan who could easily be coerced or coopted into censoring transactions, force privacy weakening changes or resist privacy enhancing ones. This anti core movement is so misguided. Like poor or sick people voting for Trump.

Drawing comparisons to floppy disks is funny and it's a comparison easy to grasp for the uninitiated, but it's also ignorant of technical realities. Did you know that the ""TCP/IP blocksize"" is usually around 1400bytes? And yet here we are, 4k video streaming for a few bucks a month. (This is also a bad analogy for various reasons, but definitely not worse than the floppy one.)

"Go look at the numbers right now.  BTC has gone below 60% market dominance and keeps reaching new lows. Volume suggests most are only buying Bitcoin to get into other coins. The strongest pair by volume is in fact ETH/BTC which is rising.

The writing is on the wall, USD valuation be damned, there is a mass exodus from BTC occuring right now. Ethereum is catching a lot of the new money, and old money is changing hands.
