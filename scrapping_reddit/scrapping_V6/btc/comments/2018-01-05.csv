"The most sane, level headed and honest post I have ever read about this market.
The market is too unstable to ever be more than speculative, this is the reason VISA dropped their crypto cards. People now condemming VISA calling them stuffy thieves etc, but the fact is its the crypto markets own fault they will never be seen as more than risky investments.
The volitility of their value makes it impossible to use them as currancy on a wide scale. Sure a few small shops will accept them but the big players wont, they do not have the time nor are they willing to invest millions in changing their hardware to enable that they change your crypto payment into FIAT INSTANTLY, why bother when there is a working system already in place.
Think of it this way, you go to wallmart spend $200, in the shop there are 300 other people also shopping, you get to the till and pay. Currently you pay $200 in FIAT, or via your debit card what ever, but Walmart is garenteed they getting $200. If you pay in BTC they have to change that into FIAT before they can use it, and they can not stop trading at your till to do this else other customers going to get pizzed at the delay because it takes time. So they have to wait before they can change it, by the time they do that BTC you paid could be worth $150. Now think of that with 50 000 customers, thats a $2 500 000, no way they going to allow that.
This is where ripple and most ether based caoins are differant they ""software"" applications but instead of generating money via traditional sales they generate it via coins which we trade. 
This is why BTC and all it derivatives are all going to die, they becoming to expensive for most people, their speeds suck, their transactions costs are ridiculous (its cheaper and faster to transfer money from Europe to the USA via Visa than via BTC) and they limited in what they can be used for.  The only real world application for BTC and its direct offspring is people who want to do shady deals with out the authorities knowing.
The Eth coins at least have real world applications and as such real world value. 
Blockchain tech is here to stay till the next invention pops up, but what we will see is less and less ICOs, also people will start demanding proof of ICO claims before giving money, all this due to the number of shady ICOs that are burning people and thus making them wiser.
Its a new field and we all are children running around without a care, but each time we fall we learn, so too will the developers as most of them are just like us. As we get older we will all get wiser, some of us will be lucky and make a lot while learning, others wont (dam market hates me LOL) But 10 years from now this industry will be booming, just walk slowly dont try become Bill Gates in 1 week, small steps till you learn to be steady then you can take big ones.

Because they can't. The shareholders are the owners of the company. Running of with money would land them in prison.


Nobody knows what Ripple will do (like just run-off with the money), but the risk is there because they have no legal obligation towards XRP holders. An additional risk, is that apparently, the XRP token isn't even an essential part of their activity and could just be abandoned.

"Wow, nice conspiracy theory! I like conspiracies, but this is a little far fetched... Ripple (opencoin) existed even before Bitcoin was born.

Why all the hate? Let me guess: pure greed. “Must... kill... competition... “.

Maybe they get nervous to see it is slowly taking the lead and rendering their hardware useless? Quick! We must fight this!! Haha! Hypocrites!

"Pretty much. XRP was an ingenious way for Ripple to raise funding. They create a token on their network, one that the network actually doesn't even need to operate. And they make sure to hold most of the tokens.

Then they let the price of XRP rise based on news that effects Ripple. People are dumb and think Ripple=XRP so they buy up XRP. All the while Ripple is selling off its XRP holdings as more get released from escrow each month.

So smart move for Ripple, they get to raise a ton of funds off of pre-mined coins, and they don't have to give up any equity.

"[xRapid](https://ripple.com/solutions/source-liquidity/), one of the the products they offer, 100% use XRP in all transactions for starters.

But if you've done a modicum of research you would realize their strategy isn't to force anyone to use XRP, which is why they offer the entire suite of products they offer. Having them adopt Ripplenet is step one and eventually they'll gravitate towards the lowest cost/most efficient settlement method, which for many use cases will be via XRP. 

Using XRP (you know, or a similar competitive currency) to free up funds held in these nostro accounts is a huge boon. This is a GIANT industry, and no doubt there will be some stiff competition for these TRILLIONS of dollars. Nobody's claiming that this is the only liquidity solution that ever has the chance to be adopted, but if I'm throwing money down today I'm putting it on the dudes with the head start.

I don't give a shit that there's no mining, I give a shit that they just whipped up 100 billion XRP out of thin air and held all of it until they distributed it. When people say 'premine' nobody gives a fuck about mining or not, they give a fuck about *fair distribution*. People have proven they don't even mind premines, as long as they're not terribly severe - see Dash as an example.

> They have an infinite amount of coins to throw at you long before the shareholders are informed and even longer before any bad news about the company is published.  

Most of the XRP reserves Ripple owns are already in Escrow. The banks who buy large reserves of XRP by contract with Ripple can’t dump it all, it’s all part of the agreement. Same thing with the cofounders and Ripple employees. Can you say the same thing about Satoshi and it’s millions of BTC? 

It’s already been mentioned that the people who bought XRP are not shareholders, but yet you come here to tell me the shareholders won’t be informed of an incoming dump. I’m confused. Again, XRP is just like any other crypto out there, if the other crypto’s developers, the miners, the exchange owners (big holders) have insider knowledge nothing stops them to dump their holdings before the rest of the world.

This is a true statement. What you might not have understood here is that **you** would be the one with total control over this network, and nobody would use it because you have total control over this network. You'd also be the central point that others would attempt to use to exert control the network - example, governments.

&nbsp;

If you were to take that protocol, and add a method of decentralized validation to secure the network outside of your hands, that would effectively relinquish control, and people would potentially actually use that network.

> Ripple answers to their shareholders and the people who want to exchange funds. That's all, if there's ever a decision that could lower the currency's value (like increasing supply or denying  transactions) then they'll take it in a heartbeat.   

Yeah, people like you and me also “want to exchange their funds”, so I guess we are in your equation, nice! Stop pretending Ripple don’t care at all about their users and community. They are targeting the banks and payment providers for now, that’s right, but it’s a big assumption to think they don’t care about users like you and me. They do care about their community, their chief cryptographer David Schwartz (Joel Katz) is very active on social medias. We are an important part of the equation, it helps with the liquidity. And it’s not because they are focusing on the banks and payment providers that they will never expand their use case to peer-to-peer in the future. That’s a bit shortsighted to think it will stop there, doesn’t it?

Why would they want to lower the value? Please explain! Of course they want the value to be higher, it will reduce volatility and they own a lot of it, so it’s also in their best interest to have a higher price. Right now if they tackle just a small slice of the pie in the market they are going after, at the actual price there just would not be enough XRP in existence to cover the funds they want to move. The price absolutely needs to be higher for the system to be efficient. The higher the better!

Because the 8 makes the X look amazing so more people will buy the most expensive one, therefore making more profits for Apple.

"> It makes no sense that the price has to stay low or super stable for it to work. 

The main use of a bridge currency (like XRP) is when one party can't deliver some illiquid 3rd world currency.

> One of the specific functions of XRP is as a bridge currency, which can be necessary if no direct exchange is available between two currencies at a specific time, for example when transacting between two rarely traded currency pairs. 

> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ripple_(payment_protocol)#As_a_bridge_currency

Bank #1 Says: ""I can't deliver Ukrainian Hryvnia (UAH) right now. How about I send you a bridge currency?""

Bank #2 Says ""Ok, fine. Send me the bridge currency, and I'll use it to buy Ukrainian Hryvnia (UAH) later""

Bank #2 would prefer a stable bridge currency, that isn't fluctuating wildly based on McAfee tweets and crazy day traders.  

Which is why I won't be surprised if Ripple later releases a stable token that is USD-pegged (or pegged to a basket of currencies) that banks can use as a stable bridge currency.

>Ripple's design focus is as a currency exchange and a distributed-RTGS, as opposed to emphasizing XRP as an alternative currency. In April 2015, Ripple Labs announced that a new feature called autobridging had been added to Ripple, with the intent of making it easier for market makers to transact between rarely traded currency pairs.

So the dumbed down version is Bank #1 purchases XRP in their native currency, and sends that XRP to Bank #2. Bank #2 receives XRP and sells it in their native currency, for example UAH. This entire process takes seconds and Bank #2 now has the UAH they asked for and Bank #1 never needed to have access to UAH in the first place. It doesn't really matter if the value of XRP is volatile day by day because the transactions happen so fast.

">If Ripple is an interbank settlment system, and XRP are bridge currency, then if XRP ever became too expensive,

XRP needs to be high enough to be functional. It can’t really be “too expensive”. The higher the better. Let’s say you have 1000$ to transfer with XRP, from which there only exist 100 units priced at 1$. You just could not transfer all your 1000$ in one transaction because there is not enough XRP in existence to cover the amount to transfer. You would need to have a 10$ XRP and to own 100% of all the XRP in existence to transfer your whole 1000$ in one transaction. Or you would need the price to climb to 20$ if you only own 50% of circulating supply (50XRP x 20$ = 1000$). The more it will be used, the higher it will need to be. It’s not really a problem.

If XRP was ever going to become too expensive in your scenario, there are still decimals of XRP, if XRP cost too much per unit you would just send a fraction of a unit like Bitcoin, what’s the problem? This is exactly what is happening right now with bitcoin, people are less and less buying a complete unit at the actual price.

> the banks could just create Ripple2 & XRP2 as a 2nd settlement network, and so on.

Why create a Ripple 2 and XRP2? You mean like Bitcoin cash, Gold, diamond and whatnot?

This is the kind of mess you get with decentralized currencies when the community disagrees. This is one of the advantages of centralization.

Or maybe you mean a second layer settlement like the lightning network? I don’t think it’s necessary, why would they do that?

XRP can handle everything by itself, it is at the center of Ripple, they are incentivized to make it succeed because they do own a lot of it. Why create competition to their own product? It doesn’t really make sense. I think it’s far more plausible they would propose an update to the XRP protocol to meet it’s requirements without harming it’s value.

But after all, let’s push your argument to the limit, when another crypto forks, the users of the old chain often get the new chain’s tokens, what would stop Ripple from doing the same if they create a XRP2? Why does it have to be a bad thing for everyone?

>There might be a max supply for XRP in Ripple.  But there's nothing that blocks Ripple and the banks from creating & using multiple settlement networks.

You’re right, there is nothing stopping the banks from using multiple settlement networks. They don’t force XRP on them, which is a good thing. But XRP is custom built to be efficient on the Ripple network. It’s fast, it’s cheap, it’s stable. But most importantly it replaces the Nostro accounts!! RippleNet alone saves 30% to the banks, but between 42% and 60% when they use XRP. This represents a lot of money for them. I think they could be interested in using it. Some partners already expressed they are interested in using XRP. It’s all out there.

After all, why use something else when you already trust Ripple enough to use their software? Why reinvent the wheel and spend ressources to develop your own crypto when there is already an existing and efficient solution available? 

Yeah, maybe for internal use a custom token could be useful, who knows. But what will they use to settle between each other’s crypto? Maybe XRP could be useful?

Or do you mean the banks would need to hold every other bank’s crypto in your scenario? What would be the difference between that and the actual system? The whole point of XRP is to be the intermediary between everyone’s currency. To eliminate Nostro accounts or even the need to hold any other bank’s crypto (in your scenario).

"XRP is an attractive asset for liquidity providers to create liquidity between any two currencies at incremental cost. To offset the risk of bridging currencies with a new asset like XRP, we plan to subsidize its use in the early days. With XRP, market makers systemwide can offer tighter spreads than traditional currency markets, fast-tracking Ripple’s path to market thickness. 

This offer is immediately compelling to small to mid-sized banks, which today rely on large correspondents to provide liquidity for cross-border payments. By sourcing liquidity from thirdparties who make markets through XRP, smaller banks can offer more competitively priced payment services to attract new customers. 

Initially, large banks will continue to source liquidity from their own FX operations and improve their processing efficiency using Ripple. However, as Ripple’s currency market grows, large banks will see benefit to posting and sourcing liquidity to and from it as well.

"Whomever made this video completely misunderstands the concept of ripple and xrp. The concept has always been a 1 for 1 amount trade for dollar not Bitcoin . Think of it as viewed from the dollar side entering the crypto world. When ripple was made Bitcoin was mined and going for $70 bucks. XRP wanted to be the safe portion to send and receive BTC between banks. At that time there was only Bitcoin and Litecoin. Ripple/XRP is old... been around longer then other coins.
 
The video is right on two parts which is liquidity and Banks. When investment banks such as JPmorgan started bonding BTC they needed a way to securely move into the crypto currency world and the SEC banned them from certain trading parts of because of the BTC. Now investing houses can reach into crypto with a safety net. If JPmorgan or any other investment group need liquidity it will come from the amount locked up, and when you need to move multiple transactions you will need that liquidity. Right now you are doing one token/coin a transaction... investors need multiple options per token/investor. You want that USD $20,000 value BTC but how are you going to keep that value unless there is a easy way for investors to get in like xrp? see you don't get it.

Premined, when ripple was first created it followed a trend as other ICO at that time of being premined there were several coming out at 2012 that were premined and ripple/xrp has seemed to last.

If you take a step back and see that the investors and founders of ripple have even stated that BTC is like gold and is like the ultimate scale in crypto world then you can understand that they just want xrp/ripple to be another player on the field and not a one stop solution, they pretty much say that. They are both invested in Bitcoin and XRP personally. They want xrp and ripple to be liquidity to move other crypto. When it is time for you to cash our on another coin and by that lambo they want to be the middle man to quickly offer banks a solution to handle your crypto problem.

Oh the reason for the wallet activation is to prevent bots, people from manipulating the market. You would have to invest so much to open multiple wallets to try to manipulating the xrp blockchain.

As far as Chuck e cheese token, being a long time miner around 2010 I remember the News calling bitcoin chuck e cheese tokens... oh the irony. Bitcoin miners always disliked xrp as it was fundamentally different and nobody understood why. lucky I was gifted with thousands myself as will as mining my own bitcoin. I see a equal playing field, not a scam and not something that will threaten the crypto world.  Chillax bro.

Why create Windows XP > Windows 7 > Windows 10?

Why have the users communicate with MSN Messenger > Windows Live Messenger > Skype?

But the big benefit of Ripple2 & XRP2 is to collect more money.

After Ripple & founders have sold off all their XRP, their free money gravy train is over.

So at that point, it makes sense to create Ripple2 & XRP2, and collect more free money from the daytraders.

There is absolutely nothing stopping Ripple from issuing XRP2, XRP3, XRP4, etc to collect more free money.

"Except that Ripple is one company, one installed platform, with a captive audience.

Let's say that 100% of banks sign up for Ripple's interbank settlement system, and let's say the banks decide to use the optional token XRP.

Over time, Ripple Labs can easily upgrade the software, to include Ripple2 & XRP2, etc.  

It's like how bank employees used Windows 95 >> Windows XP >> Windows 7 >> Windows 10.  

And with those upgrades, they might have used MSN Messenger >> Windows Live Messenger >> Skype, which were included with each OS upgrade.

When you say ""Bitcoin Cash did exactly that to Bitcoin Core"", that's a different case.  Whenever there is a new fork (Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Diamond), retail nodes like Coinbase, Bitpay, Coinify, Exodus wallet don't automatically support it.  They evaluate it like a new cryptocurrency.  People like Roger Ver have to convince the various companies to adopt BCH.

"Banks hold a variety of currencies, including US dollar, Yen, Euro, etc.  

Even if XRP is one of the currencies they're holding, it would NOT be in the banks overall interest for the price of XRP to rise, since it would reduce the relative value of the other currencies they're holding (since they need to swap in & out of XRP the bridge currency)

If anything, the banks would want a bridge currency with a stable price.  And that isn't going to be a publicly traded cryptocurrency like XRP, which can fluctuate wildly based on McAfee tweets and crazy day traders.

It wouldn't surprise me if Ripple later releases a stable token that is USD-pegged (or pegged to a basket of currencies) that banks can use as a stable bridge currency.";10;2;False;normal_rc;ds7z6g3;Ripple is a funding scheme to help the banks fight Bitcoin.

"> Any coin where a team owns more than either 20% (and that's already pushing it, some coins are fully dispersed) of the total supply and/or 50% of the voting weight (that includes miners) is an outright scam.

And those numbers come from where exactly? In real world the original inventors of a product or the original owners of a company often keep 51% of the company they own and it’s assets to remain in control of it and be sure they can keep it on track with their vision. By your standard there would be a lot of scams out there if you only keep this criteria to define what is a scam.

My definition has more to do with being dishonest and knowingly stealing people’s money, but I won’t convince you Ripple is not stealing my money, right? 

In your calculation, can you tell me what is the percentage of XRP the ripple team owns? You do realize the coins in possession of Ripple the company does not belong to the team, right?

Do you think all the Bitcoin core developers together own more than 20% of all the Bitcoins in circulation? Satoshi owns more than 6% of circulating supply all by itself, I hope the other devs don’t hold too much... How did you calculate the total owned by the Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash « team » of developers and it’s miners? Or are you telling me Bitcoin is a scam too?

>> Do you really think you have any kind of protection or that any of those people in power owes you anything?!  


>>>That's exactly my point. Thanks for finally catching on.  

Wow, did you really take my sentence out of context just like that to make your point? 😂 How pathetic is that! Here is the context of who I was talking about (in the sentence right before your quote): 
>> Do you even realize you are being manipulated by a few people already (the big miners, the core developers, the exchange owners, etc.).

I wasn’t talking about Ripple at all! haha! I can’t believe it, what a joke!

>>the exchange owners (big holders) have insider knowledge nothing stops them to dump their holdings before the rest of the world.  


>People who keep their coins on these exchanges are just as naive as those who bought XRP.  

Oh please! Again? Are you really taking another quote out of it’s context and even trunking the rest of the sentence to make it seem like a whole other meaning and make your point? Pathetic!!! Please stop that. And what does your answer has to do with this conversation?! Just another occasion to bitch? Come on, grow up! Here is my original sentence and context: 

>>Again, XRP is just like any other crypto out there, if the other crypto’s developers, the miners, the exchange owners (big holders) have insider knowledge nothing stops them to dump their holdings before the rest of the world. Again, what’s your point? What’s the difference?

See? Not the same meaning is it?


>Shareholders will be informed as per the law or the team commits insider trading fraud. XRP holders are not shareholders and don't have this protection. They can and will be the first to receive a fresh dump on their holdings if the company needs the funds to stay afloat. 

Does it even make sense? If the shareholders behind the company can’t dump before anyone else, who will? If XRP holders don’t have insider information, what is the problem?! Or you are telling me the shareholders will inform the XRP holders? Isn’t this insider trading also? Why would the company dump it’s XRP on the market, therefore lowering the price of it and their own profit? Do you really think they have to dump large amounts of their reserves to stay afloat? I’m pretty sure they are doing great with what they are regularly selling.

"Because it's a horrible scam. It's worse than Bitcoin Gold or Bitcoin Diamond or Bitcoin God or whatever. At least in case of those coins you get non-controlled tokens which are supposed to be in use. Just won't be because of premines.

In Ripple you have premine AND completely useless token which can be withdrawn or released on a whim of a private corporation.

Ripple is no better than Webmoney, Perfect Money, Liberty Dollars or EGold. It's even worse than Paypal [because XRP tokens have virtually no reason behind them](https://np.reddit.com/r/Ripple/comments/6mczyn/actually_using_ripple_why_so_few_xrp_merchants/).

I seriously want to petition all the marketcap places to remove Ripple because it has nothing to do with CryptoCurrency.

"Again me:

> You said they (newspapers) 

And you:

> **I equated** mainstream media with newspapers.

This is not the same. But I see some further explanation is in order.

By newspapers I meant literal newspapers, like made out of paper.

And yes, the medium (paper) **will** become irrelevant. But the companies that used paper just moved on to the next medium.

.

The same with Bitcoin. Banks will be made irrelevant because the medium that is being used for purchases (fiat money) will become irrelevant. They will have to use Bitcoin.

And Internet liberated the society, making it possible(and much easier than before) for a single man (like Snowden, Assange) to change entire world.

The same with Bitcoin. Bitcoin will liberate the society from banks, even if the banks will keep existing. They will just lose dominance.

Of course, old empires will fall, new empires will be built and new machine of terror & propaganda will be created again in some time. History usually circles like this.

But the society progresses anyway and people are now richer and healthier and less likely to die in a war or assault that ever before in mankind's history. But all of this will be nothing compared to the progress we can make when Joe Sixpack is freed from the banking cartel.

Now we are going sub-light speeds. After Bitcoin(Cash) is the dominant currency, we will go into hyperspeed mode.";1;0;False;ShadowOfHarbringer;ds77zt0;Life imitates art.;7o2j9k;https://i.redd.it/51r2821mny701.jpg

Horseshit.

>The Federal Reserve System is composed of several layers. It is governed by the presidentially appointed Board of Governors or Federal Reserve Board (FRB). Twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks, located in cities throughout the nation, oversee the privately owned U.S. member banks. 

Let's see what other system is controlled by presidential appointments? Oh right most of them including and not limited to the FCC, the National Security Advisor, Secretary of Agriculture... and in a way even the Supreme Court is controlled by presidential appointments.

Unless you're implying the Supreme Court isn't a government entity?

The Fed is absolutely a government entity. Does it have little to no oversight? Yes. Should it have congressional oversight? I think as finance is the purview of Congress it absolutely should... But that's not something that renders it invalid as a Government Entity.

"The problem lies in your first sentence - You have this coin effectively cut in half in two separate projects - Bitcoin is widely adopted but can't actually be used as any sort of Internet fiat replacement due to the high fees, and BCH alleviates this but lacks the wide adoption.

I'd agree with you a year ago, but right now Bitcoin cannot be used widely for anything other than larger transactions, and a lot of big companies that did use it have discontinued it (such as Steam). You have fanboism wishing Amazon will accept it without looking at the fact that micro-transactions cost $20 each. There is just a vast disconnect with reality in Bitcoin core supporters. 

There are a lot of good coins that will eclipse Ethereum soon where it failed to be a Bitcoin replacement - EOS, NEO and Cardano are just a few. Even projects like Waves I believe will have a good shot.

As long as Bitcoin core continues to rest on its laurels and fails to immediately address its issues whilst its bubble and fanboism continually increases, it is doomed to be eclipsed by 3rd gen coins.

"> Like a dream being crushed

Now you know how I(we - /r/btc) feel. Not only did they crush our dreams, they exiled us for disagreeing not agreeing with the narrative, and for embracing the whitepaper written by bitcoin's creator.

Luckily, on August 1st 2017, Bitcoin Cash we (re)born. Those who do not call the whitepaper a relic or a 'living document' again have the OG bitcoin to believe in. It is truly beautiful.

You may be missing the point tho. Blockstream REFUSES to up the block limit and have severely crippled the chain, spawning bitcoin cash. This is no ones fault but their own. THey continuously lied, for years. They lied to everyone. The community, the miners, and the devs. They fucking removed the commit keys from the dude who worked alongside Satoshi and then did nothing but talk shit about him.

It goes on and on, and on.

"Great :)

I think some of the suggestions were good.
We can't keep relying on reddit, maybe adding some kind of address linking?

Link for the first time a withdrawal address and if you want to change you'd need to sign a message with the new withdrawal.

It's cumbersome for users, so maybe making it optional, so that high tip worth users can enable it.
