"The BTC / BCH cism is politically based. Not increasing the blocksize was a political move by the BTC side, disguised as a technical one. To many tears and sweat were spent trying to reach a compromise to no avail. And this is only one of the strokes that paint a bigger nasty picture:

It's just too many things that smell bad in the BTC camp, and wont change just with an increase of the blocksize (which will never happen). But in any case you don't suddenly regain like that all the confidence completely lost over years. That ship sailed and will never come back.

"> Gigablocks are cool, but I believe they will further centralize mining

I think you don't understand modern mining.

Unless you are a very large mining operation, when you mine, you contribute hashpower to a pool. You do not yourself store or create blocks. The pool operator does that.  And pools are capable of following large blocks up to a very large scale.

Now there may be reason to fear mining centralization from pools, but large blocks aren't one of them.

On the other hand significant adoption thanks to larger blocks is a strong driver of decentralization....";13;1;False;jessquit;dw22sai;Crypto jocks vs. nerds?... (a do-your-homework-doodle);8612wg;https://i.redd.it/836w1ihch3n01.jpg

I want to see how LN plays out too, but I do not see what it has to do with Bitcoin scaling or why you're mentioning it along side larger blocks. It's not a scaling solution, sure it can handle some hypothetical business that may exist at some point in the distant future, but it has nothing to do with scaling. The only reason people would mention it along side, or as an alternative is if they have bought in to the propaganda, instead of doing their homework.

The main reason I want to see how LN plays out is because it'll be as disastrous as Theranos, but in public and with more people losing money. Great entertainment, that LN.

"I hear this a lot about how larger blocks will “centralize mining” but I’m genuinely curious if this is true or if this is just a collective assumption like “the earth is flat”. 

From my recollection, the way bitcoin was designed there is a physically built-in mechanism, few people mention, that would encourage competition and discourage centralization. If we were to establish that the “currency” for miners were **hashrate/KWh** the current investment into hashrate/KWh would gradually decrease in value over time (Moore’s Law = depreciation and improvements in electric generation ensure this). Which would [should?] mean that an existing firm(s) with a net dominant hashrate/KWh **MUST** continuously invest in their infrastructure at ever lower operating costs in order to maintain their hashrate/KWh dominance. With blocks being “fair play” aka Bitcoin protocol is agnostic to who is awarded the next block reward. The protocol naturally prevents anti competitive behavior with their incentive structure (no inherent advantage other than hashrate/KWh giving you a higher probability of finding the next block). 

Knowing this mechanism and economic design how exactly does this result in centralization? Investments into improvements like ASICS and highly efficient hashrate/KWh should encourage competitive behavior not the other way around. At the end, even with fewer participants/firms, the incentive structure is for all actors to *play fair* as all participants have significant “skin in the game” and theoretically there should [would?] be a cooperative equilibrium (discourages foul play because why “kill the goose that lays everyones golden eggs”?). Decentralization is a trade off... the more participants... the more challenging it is to reach asynchronous consensus on the state. By lowering the barrier of entry aka “no skin in the game” (no stake) you encourage more malicious actors to participate meaning you need 2n+1 *good nodes* simply to **ensure** the safety and liveness of the network.

This really begs the question... what exactly are we trying to accomplish here? ";3;0;False;tenka3;dw2evgf;Crypto jocks vs. nerds?... (a do-your-homework-doodle);8612wg;https://i.redd.it/836w1ihch3n01.jpg
"> Actually, this just shows that the author acknowledges the fact that there are a lot of people in crypto right now who don't know what's what, and that a select few actually understand the protocol behind bitcoin.

I would like to point out that you fall into the category of not knowing what's what, because there really was never a debate and big blocks have always been the scaling solution. There being a ""debate"" was a forced narrative, and fact is actually that *no* discussion between two sides actually occurred.

And the reasons you give for why you believe it to be up to debate are actually non-reasons. It's been proven that up until 1gb blocks are absolutely perfectly sustainable in the long run and *don't* further centralize mining.

I think the centralization risk of LN is far greater than larger blocks. Hubs with higher liquidity will be able to handle more traffic and reap the lion's share of the LN fees.

LN is cool in theory, channels definitely work as promised between two people. The main problem is routing between millions of nodes. Centralization is likely to be the fix. Being able to run a full node on a PC would be nice, but I think it is too restrictive to throughput. 

Bitcoin Cash can definitely scale way beyond current usage.

"I disagree on them having nothing to lose. High transaction fees greatly restrict its viability as a currency and many early vendor BTC adopters have stopped using BTC or moved on to BCH. If the only thing BTC has going for it is that there's a limited supply available and barely any vendors, it makes no sense for anyone to be invested in it versus just adopting BCH (assuming no 51% attack, private key encryption being broken, etc).

It reminds me a lot of Yahoo vs Google in the early days when Yahoo was dominant but spent their money on other enterprises like Yahoo News, Movies, etc, while Google focused on just its search engine; we now know exactly who came out on top.

And of course there is the issue of closing a channel is still an on-chain transaction so if we ever go back to those silly $20 a transaction fee, it will undermine the whole system.

"I often thought the same exact thing, if I remember correctly, BTC wanted to optimize other scaling options prior to raising the blocksize limit. Which led me to the same conclusion that BCH wouldn’t have the same leverage.

However, CSW patents changes the game a long with as others state, how BTC goes about running their version of the Bitcoin protocol with not allowing open discussion, that’s unintuitive for the long run.

I do believe that both can coexist and that the possible reasoning for BTC actions is that their vision is to comply with governing regulations to be the choice for cooperations/etc.. moving forward. 

Edit: to clarify, by BTCs vision to be the choice for governing bodies. I mean that by using solutions like the lightning network, you force the fees away from miners and into hubs on the lightning network, which may not seem like a big deal at the moment. However, in the future if LN needs centralized liquidity hubs in order to function on a world scaling level. I would assume it would be in governing bodies best interests to be those liquidity hubs.

"This is my biggest concern of BCH. It hinges on BTC not raising the blocksize and continuing to believe in high transaction fees. If BTC team gets an epiphany tomorrow and suddenly says ""Wait a minute, what if we had bigger block size AND lightning network!?"", BCH would be in real deep doop. On the other hand, a surprising amount of infrastructure has already shifted away from BTC over to BCH as vendors support BCH over BTC so they still have that leverage going on.

So you would be correct, the only benefit BCH has over BTC is the blocksize increase. However given the rate of vendor adoption, it would be possible for BCH to be so entrenched in our economy that people would be reluctant to move back over to BTC even if BTC raises the blocksize.

On the note of miners, as much as I dislike fees, the entire security of the BT network relies on having a high hash rate to deter attackers. Offchain scaling solutions would still require the chain itself to be secure so if miners begin to drop out due to low profitably, it could seriously compromise the system. This feels like one of those ""We want low fees AND high hash rate"" paradoxes where a compromise must be met. (Personally I'm rooting for some magical not-yet-discovered PoW algorithm that's going to drastically reduce mining electricity costs but still be secured by some giant consensus)



[If this website is correct,](https://fork.lol/), then BCH only has ~12% of the total hashrate BTC has which makes me sweat bullets. Somewhere earlier on Reddit I remember reading a response to a 51% BCH attack: ""lol you'd have to spend $60 million dollars on mining equipment to pull it off,"" except didn't Russia just invest $100 million into mining infrastructure during the summer of last year? BCH is still well within the limit of an attack from a sovereign power or giant pools. Not to fear-monger but I think it's important for people to understand this vulnerability does exist and is far from impossible, unlike a 51% attack on BTC, possible but highly improbable. 

I just had the craziest idea, what if people just mined BCH from their computer, not for the sake of profit but for the sake of communal security?

"**Grandiose delusions**

Grandiose delusions (GD), delusions of grandeur, expansive delusions also known as megalomania are a subtype of delusion that occur in patients suffering from a wide range of psychiatric diseases, including two-thirds of patients in manic state of bipolar disorder, half of those with schizophrenia, patients with the grandiose subtype of delusional disorder, and a substantial portion of those with substance abuse disorders. GDs are characterized by fantastical beliefs that one is famous, omnipotent, wealthy, or otherwise very powerful. The delusions are generally fantastic and typically have a religious, science fictional, or supernatural theme. There is a relative lack of research into GD, in contrast to persecutory delusions and auditory hallucinations.

"I'm against core, and a big blocker for pragmatic reasons, but some things they say make sense.  For example, I have trouble dismissing this claim:

""The demand for externalized-cost highly replicated external storage at price zero is effectively infinite.""

That actually makes sense to me, so I see where that reasoning could lead you to want a fee-market to develop. 

For both core and cash forks, I don't see a real solution to the long-term infinite growth of the blockchain. If the blockchain is water pouring from a faucet into a sink with no drain, slowing the water (segwit and lightning) doesn't solve the problem. Expanding the sink doesn't quite do it either.

">You are being intentionally dense. His point was not whether there was a standing policy prohibiting it.
>
>His point was that they did absolutely nothing to stop it. Don’t pretend you don’t understand his point. You do.

You seem to be misreading both the user's post and my response to it. KeepingTrack stated that there were listings which led to ""allegations of pedophilia sales, and murder for hire""  - I stated that this was absolutely untrue, because there were **no** allegations nor charges of pedophilia sales listings nor murder for hire listings. I then asked them to link to the government's prosecution documents which mention such listings. I provided a $100 in BCH reward for this because I know that they do not exist, so my BCH is completely safe and the user's blatant trolling would become obvious when they cannot back up their claims.

You also seem to have no idea of the side effects of the vendor bond system which actually did prevent such listings from appearing in the first place. I explain this below.

>Like he said. There could’ve been a simple word filter to block it out in search.

I'm not sure why you're bringing up a word filter to block something out through the search function when a word filter would not have been required because such listings did not exist, and therefore a search would have returned no results.

The reason for the above is that Silk Road was not a marketplace where anybody could simply post a listing. A user had to pay a 'vendor bond' in order to upgrade their account which would make it an exercise in losing money to spend hundreds of Dollars to upgrade an account simply to create a listing for something as wholly reviled as child pornography, or indeed a 'hitman for hire' listing, and lose the vendor bond as soon as it was spotted - something which would have happened as soon as site staff scanned listings, which itself is something that occurred numerous times daily.

There were also report functions which allowed users to report vendors for any reason they felt necessary.

>They didn’t even bother to do that.

You're in no position to state that as a fact; Silk Road expressly prohibited and actively removed anything related to pedophilia and murder both on the marketplace and discussion forums. Accounts were banned straight off the bat for such posts on the discussion forums, and 'digital goods' vendors who advertised their listings for pennies did not risk the funds they had tied up in their vendor bond by creating a listing for banned items.";19;1;False;garybitcoincom;dw1kltq;Ross Ulbricht turns 34 on March 27.

Basically actually governing a country is pretty hard so the political cast is relying on financial and practical help from lobbying groups.

In the legislation process it is common practice to consider the interests of relevant lobbying groups as well as relying on their expertise. 

Though not a gov, but a multinational organisation, interpol is incredibly corrupt because they have to rely on money from the private sector and donations from certain countries.

As you can see there's an obvious conflict of interest rooted within what we call the most functional democracies when so called public servants are mainly being influenced by interest groups which of course are only representing the interests of whatever particular group they stem from.

Public servants swear to serve the people not a small group of people with the loudest voices and the most money. ";3;0;False;AuroraSCII;dw1g71y;Ross Ulbricht turns 34 on March 27.

"FFS at some of the comments here. Yes Ulbricht has been in prison for five years, but that's not an extreme result. People can argue in good faith about whether the murder for hire allegations should have been raised (it is common for sentencing to consider charges that did not result in a conviction, and I agree with those who think the practice is unconstitutional*), but Ulbricht's conduct clearly fell within the Federal Continuing Criminal Enterprise statute. 

Ulbricht committed a continuing series of felony violations of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970. He did so in concert with 5 or more people. He was the head of the conspiracy and he obtained substantial income or resources from the drug violations. I don't believe any of this is seriously in question.

As such, the mandatory minimum sentence is 20 years. None of the other allegations surrounding Ulbricht factor in to that-his conduct falls squarely into the drug kingpin statute. One can buy into every one of the arguments Ulbricht raised as mitigation in his sentencing hearing, and 20 years would STILL be the minimum sentence.

I'm sure I'll be downvoted to Hades for this, but if you disagree, I challenge you to reply with an argument rooted in the law instead of in policy. ""Bitcoin is freedom!"" isn't a legal argument, and I argue that crypto has nothing to do with Ulbricht's conduct meriting a hefty Federal prison sentence under existing law.

I'll briefly address the life sentence-yes. It was harsh. Yes-there was room to exercise discretion in either direction, and I actually agree that the life sentence was too much. I'd have preferred something in the lower range of the sentencing guidelines, keeping in mind, again, that the lower range starts at 20 years. But note that the level of money that Ulbricht earned through the Silk Road was itself sufficient to potentially receive a life sentence under the Continuing Criminal Enterprise statute. He was the leader of a criminal enterprise that generated at least 10 million dollars in gross profit in a single year--the prosecutors didn't press this point, but they could have, and had they done so, the mandatory minimum would have been a life sentence. And again, that doesn't bring in any of the allegations of murder for hire or overdose deaths of Silk Road users or criminal conduct of the investigating Federal agents or the allegations of judicial bias against him. That's just based on what seems to be the undisputed facts. (And again, sure, mandatory minimums are bad policy and I'm not a fan of them, but the Supreme Court has repeatedly found that they are not unconstitutional, and so changes require legislation. Ulbricht has been treated harshly but not any more unfairly than any other criminal defendant in his position.)

"> “Money is one motivating factor for me. If it wasn’t I wouldn’t impose a commission on trades, or require vendors to use the Silk Road payment processor. Money motivates me for two reasons. For one, I have basic human needs that money allows me to meet so that I may devote my time to our cause. I also enjoy a few first-world pleasures that I feel I have earned, but nothing extravagant. In fact, compared to most I know, I still live quite frugally. I buy better food at the grocery store now, and got some new clothes, and am more generous with my friends and loved ones, but I’ve always been a cheap ass, and still kinda am out of habit. Besides that, I don’t want the attention that buying big toys brings for security reasons.

> More importantly, money is powerful, and it’s going to take power to affect the kinds of changes I want to see. Money allows us to expand our infrastructure and manpower to accommodate the growing demands of our market and to pursue paths that will compliment and strengthen what’s already been created here.

> All that being said, my primary motivation is not personal wealth, but making a difference. As corny as it sounds, I just want to look back on my life and know that I did something worthwhile that helped people. It’s fulfilling to me. If you don’t know this joy, you may hear my words as insincere and as a way to manipulate, but I know they are true and resonate with some of you. There is nothing wrong with living your life to maximize your own pleasure, so long as you aren’t hurting anyone in the process, but you will miss out on higher levels of happiness if your focus is always on yourself. It’s paradoxical, but the less you focus on your own happiness and focus on others’, the happier you’ll be. Try it out, you can always go back to being selfish. :)”

"You didn't really answer any of my questions.

Nobody has bought up 'all the land'. That's why we have nation states, where a collective body of people share the same land and make rules within their territory (countries) that allows people within that jurisdiction to earn land for themselves (buying property). If some other governing body wants that land they need to take it by force or by agreement (war/annexation).

"You can't read? What are you getting at? 

Here is his complete statement:
=================================
""For the first 7 years or so, BTC was what was described in the Satoshi White Paper. With that formula it became a world wide phenomenon. In the last year and a half it became something completely different than what it was the first 7 years. BCH still has the same formula that made BTC a world wide phenomenon. That is why I'm now much more bullish on BCH than BTC. (The empirical evidence of a 7 year track record)""
==================================

Now, we can see that he states in the first 7 years or so, BTC followed the white paper, and it became a worldwide phenomenon. 

Then he says, in the last year and a half, it became different, not the whitepaper.

He says he is more bullish on BCH, because it follows the whitepaper, aka the first 7 years of btc, and that it become a worldwide phenomenon. 

I simply point out how this is great marketing. Because bitcoin was a larger phenomenon when it had its bull run to 20k, thus invalidating his statement

"The commons belong to everybody.

What gives *you* the right to exclusively control a specific piece of land?

The standard answer I have seen is that making improvements gives you that right. However, the animals may make land improvements as well. That does not prevent them from being evicted by force.

Late edit: I think this argument can be summed up as follows:

* If the commons are under private, rather than collective ownership, then:
* They must have been taken by force.
* Thus authoritarianism.

In the real world , there is some room for grey though.

"Well I'm sure your up vote on that thread would have made the world of difference.

Let's start again. Essentially in whatever forum, there were 2 main binary arguments

1. Bitcoin needs a cap on the number of transaction per second to develop a fee market/stop it becoming centralised.

2. Bitcoin can have no limit on the number of transactions per second because transaction growth is linear and Moore's Law will stop it  becoming centralised.

The other argument was:

1. Bitcoin should never hard fork without extreme consensus as that would result in a messy chain split where nodes that did not update would be ejected from the network

2. Bitcoin should always be updated by hard forks as it allows the market to decide.

I've got to be honest - I'm not sure where the failure to comprehend what /u/flowtrop is saying is. BTC rose to universal recognition in the last few months. I doubt I have a non-techy friend or family member now who hasn't heard about it - I hear random conversations on the street about it. Early 2017 and before, this most definitely wasn't the case. So... when Roger says that BCH follows the formula that made BTC a world wide phenomenon, it can be argued (whether you agree with this or not) that BTC only truly became a world wide phenomenon since its split from BCH.;1;1;False;HawkinsT;dw19hcm;I’m here to eat shit and admit I was wrong, other new people take my warning;85uo6j;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/85uo6j/im_here_to_eat_shit_and_admit_i_was_wrong_other/
"> universal recognition

Now [you're] talking about ubiquity and not necessarily a world wide phenomenon. I don't how long you've been around bitcoin, but almost every major newspaper and major TV news network covered bitcoin quite extensively and the buzz on the internet surrounding it was massive in late-2013 already. Archives and internet traffic statistics show it got more attention than almost anything else in the world around November/December of that year.";1;1;False;Bitcoinopoly;dw2l66e;I’m here to eat shit and admit I was wrong, other new people take my warning;85uo6j;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/85uo6j/im_here_to_eat_shit_and_admit_i_was_wrong_other/
"I's first interested in BTC around 2011, but then lost interest for a few years; that really shouldn't matter though, if BTC had obtained universal awareness in 2013---whether I were in the space or not---it would be familiar to me then. I know from personal experience that in late 2017 I suddenly had a lot of people coming up to me and asking me about bitcoin/crypto that hadn't shown any interest or awareness before (e.g. in 2013); I only remember discussing btc with friends who had computing backgrounds, like myself, then (in fact, Google trends shows only 12% of the interest bitcoin had last December, in 2013). It may have made a few headlines, but there still wasn't the *universal* awareness then as there is now. This, of course, is an opinion since we're not talking about something quantatitve, so I don't have much desire to debate it as I'm sure if you disagree we'd just go round in circles. I hope you can see, however, that even if this isn't your belief there are plenty of people who do consider 2017 as being a highly significant to the public awareness of BTC, and could consider it the real point of universal recognition. When we're in our own bubbles, be it crypto or anything else, it's often hard to judge the overall public awareness of things as we're especially tuned into anything going on that aligns with our interests.

"The belief that the blocksize cannot really be safely raised is the whole reason BTC went the way it did. To understand BCH's *raison d'etre* really requires understanding where BTC's thought leaders went wrong and why. What did they misunderstand that led them to the conclusion that scaling onchain won't work like Satoshi thought it would? 

There's a very specific answer: they misread the beginning of Section 8 of the whitepaper where it mentions the network being ""overpowered by an attacker"" to mean a majority-hashpower attacker (51% attack) when it actually refers to a minority-hashpower rogue miner who happens to find a few blocks in a row by luck. If you read the section carefully and in context with the rest of the paper it becomes obvious, but key Core developers continue to deny this.

Why does this seemingly obscure point matter? Because that simple misunderstanding results in them misinterpreting the rest of Satoshi's explanation about SPV wallet security. It makes them conclude SPV wallets are not secure given current technology (lack of the necessary type of fraud proofs). As a result, they think of the nodes that constitute the Bitcoin network as being anyone who runs the software, rather than basically only miners as Satoshi had it. ""Since SPV doesn't really work, we need full clients to be runnable by everyone, so we must keep resource usage very low otherwise Bitcoin will collapse,"" they say. 

Once you understand that SPV already works equally as well as a full client (*unless* you want to accept 0-confirmation transactions), and that non-mining full clients actually do nothing for security and decentralization, you can see that BTC has crippled itself in several major ways for no reason at all, and that every other blockchain-based altcoin has done the same, following Core's example. 


I don't expect this to make sense right away, both since I haven't made the full argument and since it's a totally different paradigm to what is repeated as a mantra throughout the crypto space (""blockchains don't scale""), but if you stick around and ask questions, preferably also read the whitepaper and think about how Bitcoin is really driven by mining incentives, I'm confident you'll gradually come to see why BCH is uniquely positioned to exert total dominance of the whole cryptocurrency world.

"> non-mining full clients actually do nothing for security and decentralization

I keep seeing this argument but do not buy it. The use of/for non-mining nodes would be to add redundancy and resiliency to the network. Mostly if a massive DDOS happens (or power outage) and drops major routes out having other nodes to connect to will keep the network up. It can allow for routing around slow parts of the network also.

So it helps increase decentralization by giving more mirrors to DL the blockchain from.

So while I jump back and forth between subs I have tended to come here more and more frequently.";5;1;False;coolcleaner;dw0z8qm;I’m here to eat shit and admit I was wrong, other new people take my warning;85uo6j;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/85uo6j/im_here_to_eat_shit_and_admit_i_was_wrong_other/
You can't have communism without authoritarianism. Nobody wants to voluntarily give away their stuff and hard work, so force is *always* necessary.

"I heard about BitcoinABC a few days before the ""Segwit2x activation drop-dead drama"" and almost immediately said to myself - ""this is it""! 

I watched deadalnix's presentation in Arnhem 2017 and just erupted with happiness! Here was a guy who said ""the people who say something isn't possible need to get out of the way of the people who are doing it"", and ""imagine if google said 'enough searches have been done today, come back tomorrow' "". 

I could see that the ABC devs were solid, the vision was just right, and the timing was perfect! In short, all of my frustration arguing against Segwit, 1MB 4eva, and Lightning was released.";3;0;False;dontknowmyabcs;dw1i1ky;I’m here to eat shit and admit I was wrong, other new people take my warning;85uo6j;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/85uo6j/im_here_to_eat_shit_and_admit_i_was_wrong_other/
