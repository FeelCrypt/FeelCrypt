Lmao.;1;0;False;;dtwo8bv;Bitcoin Cash - Life's a BCH!;7uhy0o;https://i.redd.it/4nzysvukzkd01.jpg
"The Herbert Hotel is an institution in these parts and Bitcoin Cash is far from dodgy as:

1. Bitcoin Cash has been gifted the *largest coin distribution* of any crypto due to blockstream/core driving away BTC's merchants and the common blockchain heritage. That puts Bitcoin Cash as far from dodgy as you can get.

2. Bitcoin Cash enjoys the *fastest transactions* (no crypto has faster merchant trades) with its 0-conf. It is even faster than the so-called lightening network which must make multiple interactive hops to an online recipient. As the [median](https://www.swiftinstitute.org/sites/default/files/upload/The%20Statistics%20of%20Payments_v15%20-%20Chapter%2010%20How%20big%20is%20that%20payment.pdf) cash spend is just $15, 0-conf can be safely used for the vast majority of BCH transactions. Bitcoin Cash 0-conf is also about as far from dodgy as you can get.

3. Bitcoin Cash always operates *uncongested by design*, even when it becomes the first [global currency](http://blog.vermorel.com/journal/2017/12/17/terabyte-blocks-for-bitcoin-cash.html), your BCH transaction will still get into the next block. Uncongested operation is very un-dodgy.

4. Bitcoin Cash has 10 minute block times necessary for *on-chain scaling to global levels*. It has already proven on-chain scaling to 8MB blocks and can scale on-chain to 32MB blocks by simply relaxing a soft-limit. The Bitcoin Cash testnet has [mined](https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://news.bitcoin.com/gigablock-testnet-researchers-mine-the-worlds-first-1gb-block/&ved=0ahUKEwiwxZCYv7DYAhWCx7wKHfD1DJUQFgglMAA&usg=AOvVaw0lommjypr6e-N0LaD5-Qb7) 1 GB blocks demonstrating on-chain scaling to beyond visa levels, and this [study](http://blog.vermorel.com/journal/2017/12/17/terabyte-blocks-for-bitcoin-cash.html) examines on-chain scaling to blocks supporting 10 billion people x 50 TXs/day! This great work looking deep into Bitcoin Cash's future make it also far from dodgy.

5. Bitcoin Cash has now begun to drive merchant [adoption](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7uhy0o/bitcoin_cash_lifes_a_bch/) with its *network effect*, an advantage acquired along with the influx of merchants. You can expect Bitcoin Cash to resume the same dominant market position it held prior to the blockstream/core aberration. Including the Herbert Hotel, these merchants as demonstrating that Bitcoin Cash is not dodgy.

6. Bitcoin Cash is supported by a community that is bound by *vision and generosity* rather than censorship and deceit. It enjoys the high moral ground of ""a peer-to-peer electronic cash system"" as described in the [whitepaper](https://bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf). Enjoying the high moral ground makes Bitcoin Cash not-dodgy also. And then there is the awesome community making Bitcoin Cash very not-dodgy.

It is your statement that is rather dodgy, as it is incorrect on *all* of its three points.

Interesting. I do agree that it’s convenient to drop the cash part but probably for different reasons. What bothers me is not that BCH copied and pasted bitcoins code... many altcoins have done that... it’s that the community fraudulently hijacked Bitcoins name and continues to confuse and scam new people thinking that they’re buying cheap bitcoin when they’re really just buying another altcoin. There’s nothing wrong with altcoins... BCH seems to be doing well for how new it is but the hostility and mudslinging that comes from this community is toxic to all cryptos.

"I've looked towards the potential counterparty offers. I've read your posts and I respect you taking the time to write. Seems in return some core devs have consistently resorted to aggression and ad hominems. Baffling. As i see counterparty has implementrd workarounds to avoid censorship and have added things like batching, and segwit soon iirc. Does not even require touching an 'alt coin'- you can directly issue an asset on the blockchain with btc only and store it on the blockchain. Then there is the possibility of trustless p2p exchange. 

Considering the fact the founders of the project chose not to immediately enrich themselves and instead 'burnt' btc then began innovating silently which is more or less saintly compared to hundreds of other projects, (it may even be the minority exception) To this day I am absolutely baffled to go back and look at some of the core devs pervasive and absolutetly venomous attacks on the project (censoring transactions, resorting to verbal aggression, reducing features, advocating lowering block size. You're absolutely right that a huge amount of capital and mindshare was ferried away into a project which now competes against bitcoin due to unnecesary hostility. There will be no doubt billions of dollars of value add on top of the eth chain, many for now may be worthless, or outright scams even but over time the market will mature and correct.

"All this might be true. Here's the issue though: I have friends that have been in this space between 1-5 years. I'm not talking online buddies I've never met. These are best friends to family members. They have been nagging me for years to get into Bitcoin (WHY DIDN'T I LISTEN?!?!?!?!). The person who has been in the longest is deep into Bitcoin and altcoins (even gave me some USB miner thing back in 2013 I thought was a virus so I didn't connect it ((WHY DIDN'T I LISTEN?!??!?!?)) He doesn't even talk about Bitcoin Cash. Any of these people I trust that are doing very well financially are very negative towards Bitcoin Cash and say it is a scam. None of them say Bitcoin isn't what it was supposed to be.

Part of me thinks they are just being reactionary, and then I have a comment like yours which calls Bitcoin Cash ""Bitcoin (the Cash fork)"" and I think they are right. It just seems less than honorable to try and hijack something that most of the Crypto world thinks is just fine.

This is when you say everyone is not fine with it, but the Bitcoin Cash folks are the only people I see up in arms about things. The Exchanges still do primary trading against BTC not BCH. If the fees and everything else you all complain about was this monumental issue, people would be jumping ship like crazy.

Again, I'm a noob and just giving it to you how I see it.

"Your posts in this thread give a good insight, thanks for taking the time to share.

I can give you my personal view, maybe it'll inform yours.

* I'm rather new as well (been interested for years, even saw the birth of ethereum almost as it was happening, but didn't feel like investing until late last year. *I know... You know... we know. Let's leave it at that.*)

* BTC vs. BCH was a topic I left on the side for some time. I used ETH to buy other coins anyway (Binance, Kucoin have lots of ETH pairs). 

* I don't own BTC and only a tiny amount of BCH. I don't really care for any bitcoin, it's the legendary origin of cryptos that I don't see prevailing forever. I'm looking at more 'modern' cryptos, newer gens as they say.


* It seems to me that history is written by the winners and so the consensual ""everyone agrees"" version is that BTC is Bitcoin and BCH is the fork. In technical terms, what I came to realize is that it's the opposite in fact. 

    BTC was more or less bought up at different levels, in a hostile manner (showing the door to legendary developers/promoters not aligned with the new management), and is now mostly centralized in direction. LN is just a furtherance of this new BTC paradigm (think: major hubs, i.e. *liquidity banks*, rather than peer-to-peer network). 

    It is, imho, a clear case of under-the-hood anticlimactic manipulation, which the BCH crowd isn't taking too well, understandably so as they see the name bitcoin lose its profound meaning (which in historical terms is a big deal, there's a *before* and an *after* crypto). The BTC crowd feels the same (mirror feeling) but I don't think they realize what's happened (or they don't really care and just follow the money, very likely to switch allegiance whenever something else becomes the dominant cryptocurrency).

* Regardless of legitimacy, looking only from business and development standpoints, Blockstream (the company essentially ruling over BTC) seems to be high on something: they're all over the place in an unordered manner (vision, strategy, projects...), they create enemies when there really is no reason (e.g. promoting their own LN+language in vocal opposition to Lightning Labs which is already doing the good work...). 

    The whole stance Blockstream adopts, quite antagonistic and righteous and yet lacking vision, reminds me of companies high on pride and ultimately on a bad slippery slope. This is why I'm expecting a ""flippening"" (i.e. some other coin (e.g. ETH or Stellar or whatever) taking over BTC in market cap) sooner rather than later. 2018.

* I think the feud between Bitcoins (Blockstream vs. Cash) will ultimately discredit both. It's a case of ""if I can't have my cake, neither can you"" lose-lose situation. Which is not a bad thing per se as it gives more space and exposure to other cryptos, and we need many different cryptos for a true emergence of *""the internet of money""* as some people call this space.

* About trading/investing, we should see two major innovations in the space this year: first the ability to move (""swap"") from/to any crypto, thereby allowing anyone to use their preferred one(s) as reference; secondly decentralized exchanges which should help swapping and bring more security to the space.

"> I'd be fine with ""Bitcoin Cash is better than bitcoin"".

I agree, and for good reasons.

Bitcoin is just a generic name. None of the existing cryptocurrencies exactly matches Bitcoin as it was originally designed. All have deviated from it to various degrees. Bitcoin Core is very different, Bitcoin Cash is slightly different. Bitcoin Cash is an upgrade, while Bitcoin Core is a significant downgrade.

So yes, Bitcoin Cash is clearly better than the original Bitcoin.

For completeness, we should say:

* Bitcoin Cash is better than the original Bitcoin.
* Bitcoin Core is much worse than the original Bitcoin.

I did, found nothing. I think you need to follow your advice. Are you team BCH vs team BTC, then you have already lost. I don't take sides. When trying to understand which of these two are better i see mainly propaganda on both sides.

BCH is made to profit ASIC miners and Jihan team. BTC is made to profit Blockstream sure. Don't see really how the could monopolize open source second layer solutions since any company is able to.

"First of all: I really love to read the latest conspiracy theories on /r/btc and the ""/r/bitcoin admins attacked their own sub"" is one of my all time favs for sure :) 

But back to initial topic: My initial comment was unrelated to the topic. Think of it as a PSA so people don't forget who the author is. 

And now back to our own topic (I know its YOU williamlondon! lol): Look, there is a definition of the word fact. And all I did was differentiate what we know for a fact, and what not.  Look what happens if we don't clearly separate fact from fiction in discussions: You first ego wrote 10hours ago: ""Hundreds of botted accounts mixed with some real ones"", your alter ego wrote 22mins ago: ""It was more than just ""some accounts"", and were clearly all bots"". 
So now we went from some bots to all bots. why did this happened? because the botiness of the accounts is not proven factual knowledge, and everyone interprets it in a way, that fits his spin of the story.
My stance is: it could be one of the twitter-pun online jokes, originating in some btc related forum somewhere.

It seemed really weird that Bitcoin.com would trash Bitcoin. This is what turned me off of buying some. Now the Twitter for Bitcoin hates Bitcoin.

>BCH only existed because it was thought up and funded by Jihan Wu. 

I think you are mistaken, it's investors in BTC and BCH who made it viable. I was a first-hand witness to the team that worked out the viability of the hard fork more than a year before Jihan published his UAHF troll post and well before Bitcoin ABC. The plan was ultimately initiated by grassroots activism after the DCG's NYA.  

>BCH attracted frauds and liars like Craig Wright and Roger Ver.

>Segwit was activated with 100% miner support

100% is just a rounding anomaly, only after the vast majority promised to upgrade the transaction limit to 2MB. The rounding error is a minority rejecting Segwit activation would have their blocks orphaned, so they had no choice.

"> Who should be in charge of the bitcoin consensus rules miners or salaried technicians?

Neither.  The community decides consensus.  This gets worked out in the marketplace.  Developers can push changes out, but if the users won't run it, then their changes are worthless.  Miners can signal all day long for changes, but if the users don't run it, the miners bail. Miners will always mine the chain that makes them the most income. Exchanges can make up labels like ""bc1"" or ""b2x"", but if the users boycott their exchanges, their labels are useless.

The bottom line is that no one group controls the protocol.  The market works it out.  Developers release their code, exchanges create their labels, miners can mine on whichever blockchain earns them the most revenue.  Consensus is the result of the free market picking which chain is called what, and how much is it worth.

That's where you guys go wrong.  You think miners dictate consensus, even though segwit2x proved you wrong.  The vast majority of miners signaled for 2x, yet when push came to shove, not a single miner dared to run that buggy software.

> What evidence is there other than social media that these people are frauds

Craig Wright literally claimed he was Satoshi, then bailed on the proof.  He uses uses this notoriety to trick investors into giving him money for his vaporware nChain.  No more needs to be said about him.  His reputation isn't debatable.  He's scum.  [Roger Ver is a pathological liar.  This is documented thoroughly.](https://youtu.be/yUO1DvqTpZ8)  These are bad people.

> 100% is just a rounding anomaly

Over the signaling period it was not a rounding anomaly.  Every single block, without exception, during the 2016 block period signaled to activated segwit.

> only after the vast majority promised to upgrade the transaction limit to 2MB. 

Promised?  What is this, the 2nd grade playground?  Did they pinky swear too?  This is a consensus driven network.  There are no promises.  Just code.

You're missing the analogy here.  No, they don't claim it's debian, they claim it's forked from debian to follow more closely the original vision of the unix way in open source.  In the same way Bitcoin Cash doesn't claim it's 'bitcoin core', it claims it's forked from Bitcoin Core to more closely follow the original vision of Satoshi's whitepaper for what Bitcoin is designed to do.  This conflict is not some deviation from the norm in open source, it's just more intense in this instance because everyone HAS to have an opinion whether it's well informed or not when their money is on the line- and bitcoin wasn't supposed to be a brand, it was supposed to be the name for the first iteration of a technology, so this claim that BCH has been co-opting the name is disingenuous in the first place.;1;1;False;gildedlink;dtwnoxt;To all Core shills saying that BCH hijacked BitCoin brand: BitCoin brand wouldn’t even exist without Jihan, Roger, Gavin and rest of early adopters who are now part of BCH community;7vvmp6;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7vvmp6/to_all_core_shills_saying_that_bch_hijacked/

I think you are right, calling Lightning an ""alt-chain"" is more accurate than calling it an ""alt-coin"". It reflects the fact that it's a separate system, but still has the economic backing of the original coin.

I don't think that non-mining nodes offer much additional decentralization. In fact, I think that every node on the network creates a *cost* in terms of additional bandwidth and/or message propagation time. Pure nodes hurt the network. That cost is only worthwhile if you have some additional service running on that node, such as mining, merchant services, block explorers, SPV wallet servers, or such. Those services all create real economic activity on the network, justifying their bandwidth usage. Since they all generate economic activity, those services also have ways of making profits, which can easily pay for running a beefy full node. If a full node eventually takes a cluster of machines running in a data center, then that's fine by me. By the time the network has that much usage, there will be *tons* of for-profit businesses happy to pay that price. The problem creates its own solution, and decentralization will remain.

I can't wait for 1GB blocks. Even a simple quad-core server is enough to run a node at this level, and yet the transaction volume will represent a big chunk of the world's economy.";2;2;False;s_tec;dtwi1nu;To all Core shills saying that BCH hijacked BitCoin brand: BitCoin brand wouldn’t even exist without Jihan, Roger, Gavin and rest of early adopters who are now part of BCH community;7vvmp6;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7vvmp6/to_all_core_shills_saying_that_bch_hijacked/

Ok, so this I have a real problem with, and shame on you for extrapolating the delimited tests done on very large blocks to infer it's a viable development plan for the future. Those tests were done on extremely hypothetical test grounds, where brand new computers were used, all nodes were connected through v.high speed internet, with unlimited bandwidth. All tests were also completed on a network of a maximum of 12 nodes, all in developed cities in developed countries.

"/u/ergofobe said it better than I probably could.

But to be clear, I have absolutely no objection to second layer solutions. I'm a massive fan of Ethereum's Raiden, and I think LN is an excellent idea.

My problem is with the fact that a single company, who's entire business revolves around 2nd layer solutions for cryptocurrency (and even clearly state this), also employ a significant number of the most influential Bitcoin devs, and that those devs, as far as I can tell, are artificially and centrally making decisions to push 2nd layer

I have absolutely no objection to LN being optional. I have a huge objection to artificially limiting the block size to 1MB and forcing people onto 2nd layer because it's the only way to use Bitcoin for a sensible fee. I know, I know, fees have dropped lately: but that's because we're in a bear market currently and people have less interest. And, frankly, I believe a good chunk of that is caused by high fees.

LN is good, but when people are being forced to use it by high fees, that's not competition: that's Blockstream pushing an agenda";1;0;False;audigex;dtwqmz9;To all Core shills saying that BCH hijacked BitCoin brand: BitCoin brand wouldn’t even exist without Jihan, Roger, Gavin and rest of early adopters who are now part of BCH community;7vvmp6;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7vvmp6/to_all_core_shills_saying_that_bch_hijacked/
"By making the second layer even better, with more features, than the first layer. You could argue that Counterparty and Omni are second-layer applications. They are used because they offer features that aren't available on the base layer. 

If you want people to move to LN, make it a lot more attractive and useful than the base layer and people will flock to it. Purposefully destroying the first layer with high-fees and congestion isn't the way to make the second layer more attractive, it just makes people hate the people who trashed the first layer.";4;1;False;DeftNerd;dtwiy3i;To all Core shills saying that BCH hijacked BitCoin brand: BitCoin brand wouldn’t even exist without Jihan, Roger, Gavin and rest of early adopters who are now part of BCH community;7vvmp6;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7vvmp6/to_all_core_shills_saying_that_bch_hijacked/

Hitler soft forked the population into nazism (same germany, same chain of aryans), and that was aligned with the original vision of germany but improved by 'true aryans' in the command (racially superior devs). He transformed europe into a german reich settlement layer (Lebensraum für das deutche Volk) and segregated witnesses into concentration camps, out of the main chain (big blocker jews).

"Consensus.

Edit:  Think of it this way, say there was an update that was better and the majority decided to follow an updated fork.  The only difference was some kind of un-contentious update.  Say after a couple of clever people buy up the old fork before the update and say no this is now the real bitcoin.  Technically, it is the truer version since it came before an update...it's more...original.  I'm not saying this is at all equivalent to bitcoin cash since that was contentious.

Funny to see small blocker changing their tunes about HF.

Would have been better if you did before the split but hey..

>The BCC HF in October where most of the community chose not to follow it is an altcoin. 

This is all semantics, the BCH split happened because the segwit soft fork was imposed on the community.

So we are in the situation of a soft fork change the currency characteristics, and part of the community split to recover the original characteristics/design.

What gives? How come the fork trying to recover the original characteristics is a fork and the one radically changing it is somehow not an Altcoin?
