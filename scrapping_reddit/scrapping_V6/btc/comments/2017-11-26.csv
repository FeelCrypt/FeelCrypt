"Very glad we can have a civilised conversation, nowadays this seems to be a lost art :)

> but I fail to see it applicable in the case of low inflation.

That's the real travesty! You know when they say a frog will jump out of a pot with boiling water, but if you put it in cold water and heat up very slowly, it'll eventually get cooked? That's exactly it!! It's because the effect is not immediate that people don't see it, but it's there. We didn't go from $1 to 5$ for a Big Mac in one day, or even a year. It took us ~30yrs! But now it seems like 5$ is just normal, and no one complains. 


>Inflation is driven by, and encourages, inherent greed.

I'm very anal when it comes to words... don't agree with this. Inflation ""allows"" greed to disguise and manifest itself, but is not driven by it. Not sure it even encourages it.

>Social and academic improvement vs production as our collective raison d'etre.

and Buddha's quote

>""Desire and ignorance are the origins of suffering.""


Will not disagree with this a bit!! The elephant in the room, however, is... 2500 years. The Buddha said that 2500 years ago, and since then, we're arguably back just where we were then! Possibly even worse, consumerism, desire for material wealth and personality cult are at ATH, never mind Bitcoin ATH! So in 2500 years we did not make very much progress on this. Feel free to disagree, but as far as I'm concerned, to believe that Bitcoin will solve this is just not realistic. Bitcoin, or cryptos in general, will just encourage saving rather than spending, so we'll need to find something else to do. Maybe this will lead to an era where we compete in physical and mental challenges instead of in hoarding wealth, but I don't believe so.

Finally, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/78gtdu/i_am_more_of_an_eth_guy_so_correct_me_if_i_am/dp0jk0i/) is a reply I wrote a while ago on the small vs big blocks issue. It touches on various topics, including Blockstream's role and more. Maybe you truly believe that we can scale on-chain, but the large expert opinion is that we cannot. A bit like global warming - You have scientists who don't believe humans are causing it, even independent scientists. My main argument for off-chain scaling is that no complex system that has successfully achieved scale has ever scaled on the base layer. And I provide examples.

"Thanks! Honestly, your reference to Brandolini sent me down a bit of a rabbit hole of reading, as it seemed to be at odd's with 'Assange's law' (to be fair I don't think it is originally Assange's idea, but I'm calling it that because I don't know a better name/reference). 

But I think the two are reconcilable: 'Assange's Law' works in an ideal situation, where participants are informed, behave logically, and are willing to learn and admit mistakes. 'Brandolini's Law' mocks this ideal, and highlights the issues that arise dealing with actual people. In reality, people [are pre-programmed to have cognitive biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases), so it can take a lot of effort to *""correct their bullshit""*, so to speak.

Anyways, I do recommend the book, its a short but interesting read. The majority of the book is just an annotated conversation, but it touches on a lot of great stuff pertaining to philosophy of journalism, digital sovereignty, they even talk about bitcoin a little! Its available for purchase online using bitcoin too :)

"> Alberto Brandolini was right

Hmm, I've read arguments for the opposite, to the effect of ""it takes more energy to conceive and maintain lies, than it does to reveal the truth"". Julian Assange talked about this in his *'When Google met Wikileaks'* book, but I can't find my copy right now to dig up an exact quote. 

I think this holds true though, even in cases like this where you have gone to great lengths to refute the bullshit. By spreading truth, liars must invest even more resources in order to perpetuate their shit. 

I think that Brandolini's law contains some truth though. In situations where understanding the truth is complex, falsehood can be more easily spread, and takes a lot of energy to clean up.

"What about paper fiat as a store of value? It’s just paper so not useful for much else. What about the numbers in your bank account? Same thing. Trust is what defines a store of value. That’s why people invest in stocks, bitcoin, etc. Gold is so antiquated I don’t know why people still compare it as if we would ever use gold as a realistic future store of value, unless there is a MAJOR world economic collapse. Humans are constantly innovating new ways of storing value.

"Um, BCH is down 30% while BTC moves further and further away from it.

Things could change at any time (perhaps when BTC goes for a future tech update), but I don't see any reason to be optimistic about BCH at the moment.  It's attempts to recover value are getting weaker and weaker.

"Hopefully BCH and BTC can indeed coexist peacefully. It's down from its recent rally. I just overheard people in a restaurant talking about crypto. I always find in person discussions to be more valuable for measuring market sentiment than online discussions where people are trying to influence each other. In-person discussions tend to be people actually seeking information and trying to reason together.

So, naturally, I eavesdropped. This was a discussion between a crypto noob and an experienced traditional investor. The noob was talking about trading and how frenetic it seemed - which jibes with my believe that almost all trading is being done by kids and inexperienced types who move too much and seek quick gains and gamble - and the investor was talking about his goal being to acquire three bitcoins and wait.

They talked about alt-coins and how they move and they also were under the same impression as myself: That Bitcoin is the gold standard upon which the interaction between a real crypto economy and the older economies will be based and that alt coins are mainly traded speculatively for quick gains and hedged via bitcoin and valued mainly on their ability to interact with bitcoin.

Can BTC coexist with BCH? It's proven it can. It can even quite easily sustain itself in the face of attacks and coordinated manipulation. Can BCH coexist with BTC? It has no choice. Accept BTC or fade into irrelevance and obsolescence. And that is *exactly* what will happen if the narrative of 'the real bitcoin' keeps going on. Experienced investors will see it as a scam and steer clear. People who buy it expecting their getting BTC and seeing it underperform will lose all faith in crypto and steer clear forever. Once bitten twice shy.

If BCH keeps claiming to be superior technology it might realize gains from that but it'll have to back up its claims. However, here's the rub - the rhetoric is self defeating. People don't hold a currency because it's better for making transactions. The price of the currency *doesn't matter* if all you want to use it for is mass market transactions. Straight up simple fact - this doesn't matter for crypto. The value can rise and fall to any amount and it'll be just as useful for any transaction and so basing a market rise on that is just self defeating.

If it can be more *secure* than bitcoin, that could be very worthwhile. If it's backed by a government that would really help the price. But if people give a shit about the price they should quit with the current stories because, frankly, it shows their hypocrisy and nobody who's ever been near wall street will buy it.";10;2;False;DeucesCracked;dqcqjtq;BTC has crossed 9000 USD;7fkrk6;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7fkrk6/btc_has_crossed_9000_usd/

Hyperinflation screws the lenders. Hyperdeflation - if I can call it that: the rapid, unpredictable increase of value of the currency - kills the borrowers.

And it might happen. The more they get people to talk about or recognize BCH the more attention it gets the more people will listen to it and try to make money off it, too.

Would you prefer less diversity, you can choose rbitcoin alone, but that is not a recommendation I would make.

"Bitcoin has little transactional value at this point - nobody is buying it to use it right now, they're buying it because they think it will go up in the future. What this means is that its current price reflects the odds that, eventually, it will reach the lofty goals it has of no less than underpinning an entire economy. Bitcoin has high transaction fees and slow processing time, so the problem effectively becomes that it is worth holding at 9000 if you think it has at least a 9% chance of hitting 100000, not because you'll use it to buy a TV tomorrow.

What this means is that bitcoin's market value is tied to its long term viability as a currency. If one can prove that its viability as a currency is nil, one can prove it is worthless as the underpinning of an economy and therefore not worth nearly what it is trading for.

I've already brought up volatility as a reason that nobody will ever lend out bitcoin - you'd require an astronomical interest rate to be assured you were making a good deal. Similarly, the fact that Bitcoin is designed to be deflationary compounds the issue. Why would you lend something out that is guaranteed to be worth more in a year than it is now? You wouldn't unless you had a very favorable interest rate. 

What I'm saying is that, for bitcoin to eventually become a real currency, at a certain point people and financial institutions will have to start using bitcoin over the dollar. For that to happen, there will have to be situations where people finance houses and cars on bitcoin, but the total lack of regulation or price control on bitcoin means people will rarely want to undertake the risk of lending or borrowing bitcoin. I'm saying there's no real mechanism to get us from point A of a ubiquitous dollar to point B of ubiquitous bitcoin, and that bitcoin has no structural regulatory system that would enable the creation of such a mechanism. Therefore there's no way to get to point B, and therefore bitcoin is worthless.  

Sorry if this is unclear. I'm reasonably drunk. ";9;3;False;GuyBelowMeDoesntLift;dqcqvgw;BTC has crossed 9000 USD;7fkrk6;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7fkrk6/btc_has_crossed_9000_usd/

In 2010 I figured a lower bound of about $50k top. I didn't think we'd get there so fast though.;7;0;False;;dqcn3av;BTC has crossed 9000 USD;7fkrk6;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7fkrk6/btc_has_crossed_9000_usd/
In 2013 I thought the top would be somewhere between $50K and $100K. Did some napkin math with made up numbers. For example what if Bitcoin trade legal or illegal reaches 10% of dollar trade which seems not entirely impossible. There are ~10.5 trillion dollars in the world so in order for bitcoin to be able to handle that trade it should increase in value to about $1.05 trillion (otherwise there will not be enough circulating supply of BTC to represent the value of that trade) that would mean that BTC must increase 10 fold on its current price. Now 10% of the dollar trade might be too much but there is also non-dollar trade in the world, there is gold as store of value and other activities from which Bitcoin can eat certain percentage which makes the prospect not so far fetched. Also we can only guess the amount of illegal trade like who knows what the value of drug deals is. These can easily go in like 50% crypto. So I am not saying that chances to reach the top are very probable but I do have an explanation how the top can be reached if the stars align correctly.;8;0;False;Eirenarch;dqcw6ro;BTC has crossed 9000 USD;7fkrk6;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7fkrk6/btc_has_crossed_9000_usd/

I lack math skills to do that. All I've is educated guess. Miners can't mine less profitable chain indefinitely - they will lose arms race and go bankrupt. Bitcoin Core can become less profitable to mine long-term - capacity is capped, but not capped in Bitcoin Cash. DAA adjustmenst in Bitcoin Cash matter less each time next % is achieved = more room to new miners for the next % and so on. Each hash that went to Bitcoin Cash means there one less hash for Bitcoin Core and it affects profitability

"BTC is supported by the Core devs, many of whom are being paid by a company whose business model is monetizing off-chain payment solutions.  BCH is supported by miners, whose investment in mining equipment provides the hashpower that allows the Bitcoin network to function.  

Before tickers existed, when there was just ""Bitcoin"" and no ""BTC"", it was an open-source project designed around a particular vision, and relied on aligning incentives between users and miners to keep the network secure and functioning.  

When the Core devs and their backers effectively suppressed on-chain scaling methods to push off-chain methods that reduce mining incentives (miners get nothing out of off-chain transactions), some miners decided to keep with the original model, but that required taking a different name and ticker unless they were willing to wage a protracted international legal battle that's basically unwinnable anyway (no one holds a trademark on the Bitcoin name).

Diversifying is ok if you do your research and invest in good coins. I can say from my analysis of the top 10 by market cap only Bitcoin Cash and Monero have a real future. BTC is a particularly bad investment. Cryptocurrency is about paying for things. If you can't actually pay for things then it's worthless. If it's too slow, the network is congested and the Core developers keep adding features like RBF which is kryptonite for merchants then it has no future. Core's actual scaling solution is a joke and requires 3 layers now. Also it's vapourware. Meanwhile the mempool never clears. Transactions sit unconfirmed for days. Lower values in wallets become unspendable due to high fees to move them. It's a joke coin. If you want to make money on Bitcoin, short the hell out of it like in the movie The Big Short. Because it's going to come down hard. You can't compare Bitcoin to gold and a store of value. Aside from gold being useful for payments (albeit slow) it has a heap of other uses like in electronics, jewellery etc. Bitcoin outside of being a currency has no other uses if it has low transaction throughput and high fees. Its value is overinflated and in a bubble.;3;0;False;BgdAz6e9wtFl1Co3;dqcpi70;"""Bitcoin.com wallet now displays ""Bitcoin Cash"" and ""Bitcoin Core"" balances.

It is not democratic. It is more of a meritocracy.

Democrazy is not what it is cracked up to be. It is what has put Umerca into the state it is now.

The meritocracy of the bitcoin dev group loosely referred to as core however, makes sense. Those that review code can start to contribute. The contributions are reviewed and tested. Theoretically the smart people make the decisions based on the open source merit based method.

It makes a whole lot more sense than 'democracy'.
