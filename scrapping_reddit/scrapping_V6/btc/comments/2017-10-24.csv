"Edit: They can't Audit the Federal Reserve, what makes you think someone can Audit Tether 😂😂😂 /s

TL;DR: You're correct, no real audit of any level has been publicly release of Tether's finances. More I read, the more the evidence indicates Tether is just printing Crypto. 

Pretty incredible when you consider that Bitcoin was founded on untrusted miners proving security of coins! 


 

I honestly haven't tracked Tether closely. I remember reading about audits back in September, but this is all that I can find. They claim to have audited 2016/12/31 to 2017-03-31, which isn't the time period in question. 

They promise an audit by a US based CPA, but no promised due date. That was ~70 days ago. A high level audit should have already completed. It really shouldn't be hard to confirm they have $X million in a bank account. Sure, a first full audit will take some time, but the Tether Blockchain will have the list of liabilities and it shouldn't be too hard to confirm how much cash they have on hand.

Auditors

We are aware of online discussions about Tether’s lack of publicly-available audits. Periodic audits of our bank balances have been performed by the Taiwan-based auditing firm TOPSUN CPAs & Co. The results of those audits were for the benefit of shareholders and were not in a form suitable for public consumption (to begin with, they were in Mandarin). Nonetheless, we have asked them to prepare the following attestations (PDFs linked) in English, for release to the community, covering December 31, 2016; January 31,2017; February 28, 2017; and, March 31, 2017. As we are no longer banking in Taiwan, and given that we are achieving substantial scale, we have engaged Friedman, LLP, in New York, to perform comprehensive balance sheet audits on a quarterly basis going back to Dec 31, 2016. We will share those results with you as they become available in the coming weeks or months.

As for this 'influx' of small blockers all over the internet - tell me where they are in real life? I don't see them at Bitcoin Meetups. I certainly don't know where they are. There are people who turn a blind eye due to profits, but that's the only reason people can give me for supporting them.

The 'scaling debate' is madness. There's a huge problem with blocks getting full and transaction fees getting high - to keep the adoption levels up you need to do something **now**! It's already been put off and delayed by months - years even. Instead, we have to wait for Segwit adoption which could take **months** and then Lightning Network which will take **months** if not years (probably the latter). We're told that a simple blocksize increase will ease up this congestion, allowing adoption to continue rapidly. More work needs to be done to scale but there's a problem that needs addressing right now, and Segwit isn't addressing it.";2;1;False;Sha-toshi;dotgu6v;Both /r/btc and /r/bitcoin are terrible subreddits;78a1t9;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/78a1t9/both_rbtc_and_rbitcoin_are_terrible_subreddits/

"I don't agree that because there may be some bad apples supporting Core that have a lot of power, the entire dev community should be replaced. It's a huge talent pool of devs and I honestly think we'd be fucked without them if a lot of them didn't jump over (which I have my doubts about). 

Sure block size increases are easy but I very much doubt we'd ever see Schnorr signatures or MAST implemented well under Jeff Garzik or Roger Ver's devteam. And IMO fungibility improvements at the base protocol should be one of the highest priorities. When you have things that can improve both fungibility and scaling without compromising nodes or putting small miners at further potential disadvantages - that should be what everyone focused on.

The NYA opposition is not only from people who think 2MB is too early but also from people who dislike a few powerful people being able to dictate protocol changes. 

Even though we disagree on a lot of fundamental details (especially including what is most important and what is not), it's still nice to see reasonable non-accusatory response. 

Time will tell if on-chain or off-chain scaling is the way to go and hopefully when S2X is over everything will settle down and people will focus more on building and promoting the projects they support than disrupting the ones the don't.

"The Satoshi claim - Craig either **is** Satoshi but can't prove it (yeah, I don't believe it personally, but is it POSSIBLE? Sure), or he isn't and it caused a bit of a stir of drama. Hardly on-par with any of the stuff I've listed.

Misrepresentation and misinformation? That's the pot calling the kettle black to be totally honest. Theymos himself practically admitted to using those tactics to sabotage Classic and XT. Unless you have solid examples and not just some 'technicalities' or an infographic that can be interpreted differently visually based on your own biases then I can't agree with you on that claim.

Really, I know **one** person who doesn't go to meetups at all anyway, I know he's real but the only reason he supports small blocks is because he's convinced as soon as you increase them to 2MB it's going to ruin the network by making it too heavy. That's kinda all he has to say on it. Meetups where I am tend to have 50% of people who are really new and not informed enough, maybe 30% then who understand enough and don't care either way as long as it make them money, and the remaining 20% **seem** to lean on the side of 2X. Alright I've not manage to speak to and interview everyone one-on-one so I'll admit that's not a 100% consensus but I've not heard anyone say otherwise.

Segwit and LN - I believe - are not inherently completely shit pieces of tech. I worry about the fact that a company will be in charge of the LN, and that will be a centralised layer on top of the blockchain. I think it **could** be implemented correctly to keep the majority of your funds secure on the blockchain, but I admit I'm not technical enough to know the limitations of that. What I absolutely do not trust is the current team being in charge of that implementation. If you remove the current Core team, I would be happy to give Segwit its fair shot at being 'Bitcoin', but as is the case in the world of Crypto, whichever chain becomes redundant **legitimately** and not via vicious attacks and sabotage, then that's fair enough.

The 'blocksize increase' is hardly doing anything. The average has gone from 1MB to 1.03MB at the most. Adoption needs to happen faster. However I still think that instead of having the world upgrade their software to allow for a 0.7MB increase, we could just have a 1MB increase and let the worldwide Bitcoin adoption continue on its exponential growth trajectory. I don't want Bitcoin to stagnate, I absolutely love the technology and I think it's the future. Right now it seems to be being hindered so that a 2nd layer can be pushed and the Core team can take the glory for it, when we could just solve the issue right now.";1;1;False;Sha-toshi;dotjbbh;Both /r/btc and /r/bitcoin are terrible subreddits;78a1t9;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/78a1t9/both_rbtc_and_rbitcoin_are_terrible_subreddits/

"That response sure was predictable, although it is the first time I hear ""Core mitigation team"", would make for a cool flair. Great use of the word whistleblower btw.

I can say the exact same thing about not being able to fathom why anyone would support obvious liars/frauds like Roger and Craig Wright.

Keeping it on a subject you seem to enjoy, I have a little conspiracy theory of my own: 

The influx of “small blockers” that have been seen on r/btc and other social media sites leading up to the 2X hf, are real people with a lot of skin in the game, strongly incentivized to do what they feel is protecting that.

I am firmly behind the Core approach, but I also understand people have different views. That's the beauty of open source software and a free society, you can go your own way.

"> Are you talking about a malicious mining majority?

Yes. The thing is that even if one entity has majority hashrate, they might choose to not attack because of attack being impractical in these days (too many people running full nodes). However, in theoretical scenario, when victim doesn't run full node, printing money is easier form of attack. Simply because for double spend attack one has to have some money in Bitcoin already (the money which drop in value in case of such attack). In case of money printing attack, that entity needs only miners + electricity.

> The basic value proposition is sound money: money that combines the reliable scarcity of a commodity like gold with the transactional efficiency of a purely-digital medium.

If this was the case, there would be no mining. The properties you describe can be achieved with central authority signing transactions (possibly in auditable manner). Since there is mining in Bitcoin, the value proposition must be something that makes mining required. And the only such thing is resistance against central control.

> Imposing an arbitrary limit on transactional capacity is a form of self-censorship and directly undermines Bitcoin's value proposition.

If you really believe so, go create another altcoin and we'll see which one wins.

> No, you just need a client that's configured to track that chain.

How does the client do that on technical level without validating blocks?

> For example, the LN suffers from what I call ""fractional-teller banking"" problem described in detail here.

This is a very good point and I consider it somewhat concerning too. Let's calculate:

* waiting time for unilateral closing of channel: 2 weeks
* block size 2MB (SegWit)
* average 2oo2 transaction size: 500B (pessimistic guess)

How many channels can be open so that all the channels can close in time?

2 weeks * 1 block / 10 min * 2MB / 500B == 8064000

So the current blockchain can safely handle ~8 million channels.

Do we need to increase the block size? Yes - we need to fit more channels into the blockchain. Do we need to do it right now? No - 8 million channels will take time to be created. If people use longer waiting time, we can fit much more.

"Miners don't need to mine invalid block in order to attack, but if they choose to attack it's easier for them to attack if they can mine invalid blocks.

The basic value proposition isn't cheap transactions. It's inability for governments to control the network. The only reason we spend huge amount of resources on mining is that we have to protect ourselves against governments.

> If you want to receive funds on one chain post-fork, that also doesn't require running a ""full node"" for that chain.

This is incorrect. It's absolutely necessary to run full node because otherwise you can't distinguish between the forks. Otherwise you'd have to trust the sender, which is exactly what Bitcoin was **not** designed for.

> They are banking, not ""scaling.""

Why do you think so? They are as trustless as Bitcoin is. What's different according to you?

> Any systemic breach of Bitcoin's money properties by a misbehaving hash power majority is going to be communicated by the market when the price craters.

You are correct. There is a difference, however: in order to perform double spend attack, miners must have some bitcoins already - the very bitcoins that will lose value after attack. However, if they can mine blocks creating bitcoins out of thin air, they don't have to have any bitcoins and ultimately don't lose anything.

"> Miners don't need to mine invalid block in order to attack, but if they choose to attack it's easier for them to attack if they can mine invalid blocks.

Are you talking about a malicious mining majority? Because in that case a valid blocks only attack is easier as there's no defense against it.  And if you're talking about a minority hash rate attacker, the question of which kind of attack is ""easier"" to pull off is immaterial. Users can simply wait for additional confirmations as appropriate based on the size and nature of a particular transaction.  

>The basic value proposition isn't cheap transactions. It's inability for governments to control the network. The only reason we spend huge amount of resources on mining is that we have to protect ourselves against governments.

The basic value proposition is sound money: money that combines the reliable scarcity of a commodity like gold with the transactional efficiency of a purely-digital medium.  The inability of governments to control the network (through arbitrary money printing or censoring transactions) is baked into that value proposition.  Imposing an arbitrary limit on transactional capacity is a form of self-censorship and directly undermines Bitcoin's value proposition.

>This is incorrect. It's absolutely necessary to run full node because otherwise you can't distinguish between the forks. Otherwise you'd have to trust the sender, which is exactly what Bitcoin was not designed for.

No, you just need a client that's configured to track that chain.  There's no sudden need to download and validate everyone else's transactions.

>Why do you think so? They are as trustless as Bitcoin is. What's different according to you?

When you move transactions to a second layer, you have, by definition, added an additional layer of risk. And that risk increases the more the main chain is artificially constrained. The smaller your ""base,"" the more precarious the structures built on top of it.  For example, the LN suffers from what I call ""fractional-teller banking"" problem described in detail [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4rdkiy/heres_how_bitcoins_lightning_network_could_fail/d50akqm/).

You absolutely lose something by mining invalid blocks with valid PoW -- the block rewards and fees you could have collected if you'd devoted that hash power to mining valid blocks. But any differences in the cost and feasibility of an invalid block attack vs. a pure double spending attack are things that you can account for simply by requiring additional confirmations before treating a transaction as final.

What are you now talking about, there is no Sybil - each node validates on it's own if block is valid.

In Bitcoin even if 99999 nodes tell me to accept given block,
and even if it has 100 exahash of work on it,
still I will reject the block if in it miner just given to himself 100 Bitcoins.

And on SPV nodes, especially on BCash where everyone will have SPV and where mining is now 90% done by one entity - you might not notice, and the part that runs own nodes and notices is too small and is ignored.

Nope. It's not cash because you publish every little transaction to the world - unlike cash.

Lighting Network is the cash because you do NOT publish details of each micro payment to entire world.

In LN you hold private key all the time, and funds are on it, just you agree to freeze the funds for a month.

Normally the other party of channel will unfreeze it at your request,  but in case he is rogue (or ""dies"") then you still hold your money in your account, and after the set time you can spend it. It never is under ownership of someone else, like happens with exchanges and web wallets.
 
> Do you have any evidence that the incentives are wrong? Because so far so good what you suggest never happened. 

It happened, that miners mined invalid blocks.

Fortunately, they realized that everyone else is rejecting them, so they had a choice to throw away thousands of USD and come back to main network, or to be a separate fork.

If it would be that most miners can do it on purpose, AND users are all on SPV and economical majority doesn't notice, they can do that successfully. 

> honest nodes, he would have to choose between using it to defraud people by stealing back his payments, or using it to generate new coins. 

This text is about something else, about making VALID blocks, but blocks that are doing block rewinding and double-spend therefore.

This text does not at all consider that miners might create INVALID blocks, not just to double-spend or rewind few blocks, but to grant themselves 1000 Bitcoins.  Or 10 Bitcoins EVERY BLOCK. 

We should never put miners in such total power position. If you want, then it's your problem, I'm staying on coin when we validate our own money.";1;1;False;Etovia;dotfoz9;Bitstamp hits 6000 USD!;77mp95;https://imgur.com/T81V9BR

Well you think in short term. Let's increase blocksize x2 or x8. Or x100.

Not take into account how this ruins layer-1 and make everyone fully hostage of miners if they would be to start giving themselves BTC rewards just because they can.

You do that, while Bitcoin Core says: it's a long race, let's give SegWit another half-year, and then try Lighting Network.

And in Core in a year we'll have x10000 more transactions.
