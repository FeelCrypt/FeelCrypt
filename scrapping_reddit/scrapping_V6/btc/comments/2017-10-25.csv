"Here's the thing : you can't have ""peace"" between the two communities when they're competing , there will *always* be friction. You call it ""bad mouthing"" but in reality it's just repeating the truth, currently there are catastrophic issues with legacy bitcoin and the r/bitcoin sub that need to be known by everyone, until at least the average crypto user doesn't get informed of that, we'll keep repeating those points. And in the outside world, virtually no one is aware of the blocksize debates and censorship problems that exist in the bitcoin community, so what the fuck is wrong with trying to spread more awareness ?

The ""bad mouthing"" and  ""maligning""  of bitcoin core and it's devs is only good for community in the long run , you either agree with their practices or you do not, there's no middle ground for you if you're a user of *any* crypto (as they're all still pretty much connected to BTC) .

Then the fact that this is r/BTC and not r/bch or r/bcc, this is a *bitcoin* subreddit , we may talk about all things bitcoin related, and core is also part of the bitcoin community, unfortunately.


Lastly, this is neither petty nor needless bickering , this is crucial info to any bitcoin user. We'll bash r/bitcoin for as long as it takes to remove them from the top spot and take away the ""real bitcoin"" brand name from the scum. Do you want to kill bitcoin , as a p2p digital cash, because shutting the fuck up about the guys in charge ruining it is how you do it.

">The thing is that even if one entity has majority hashrate, they might choose to not attack because of attack being impractical in these days (too many people running full nodes). 

Again, a malicious majority miner could simply choose to attack with a double spending attack, against which “full nodes” are defenseless.

>However, in theoretical scenario, when victim doesn't run full node, printing money is easier form of attack. Simply because for double spend attack one has to have some money in Bitcoin already (the money which drop in value in case of such attack). In case of money printing attack, that entity needs only miners + electricity.

I think it’s safe to say that if you have enough hash rate to pull off a meaningful attack, you’re also going to have a non-trivial sum of coins. But sure, if you receive a payment for an extraordinary sum where this difference might actually matter (e.g., 100,000 BTC) you’re probably going to wait for a shit-ton of confirmations before you treat it as finally confirmed. You’re probably going to at least consult with a number of full node operators to see if they’ve confirmed the transaction in question (e.g., the various block explorers). And heck, if you’re getting a payment of 100,000 BTC, you *might* even be someone who considers running your very own “full node.” But none of this changes the fact that SPV provides at worst slower security, not less security.

>If this was the case, there would be no mining. The properties you describe can be achieved with central authority signing transactions (possibly in auditable manner). Since there is mining in Bitcoin, the value proposition must be something that makes mining required. And the only such thing is resistance against central control.

Huh? How are you going to trust a central authority not to engage in money printing?  How are you going to trust a central authority not to censor transactions?

>If you really believe so, go create another altcoin and we'll see which one wins.

That’s silly. Obviously if the Bitcoin main chain did continue to cripple itself with an arbitrary and absurdly-tiny limit on capacity in the face of rising transactional demand, it WOULD eventually be outcompeted by an unhobbled alternative.  But the network effect is a beast. And so I think that it’s more likely that the Bitcoin network will eventually upgrade itself via a hash rate majority-supported fork.  

>How does the client do that on technical level without validating blocks?

With the headers? So a split occurs at block height X.  The block for chain A with block height X has this hash.  The block for chain B with block height X has this different hash.  If a chain split occurs, it shouldn’t be terribly difficult to configure a client to distinguish one chain from the other without downloading and validating every single block and transaction.    

>How many channels can be open so that all the channels can close in time?
>2 weeks * 1 block / 10 min * 2MB / 500B == 8064000
>So the current blockchain can safely handle ~8 million channels.

So you think you can just assume that the only transactions being broadcast to the network during the critical period are going to be channel closing transactions? No one is making transactions to *open* additional channels?  No one is making non-LN-related transactions? And everyone is going to be patiently waiting in line and sending only their one allotted transaction? No one is acting adversarially? No one is attempting to deliberately overload the network with spam transactions in an attempt to defraud one or more of their channel partners?  Those are some pretty breathtaking assumptions. And of course, the “fractional-teller banking” issue isn’t the only reason the LN isn’t a panacea.  There’s also the fact that the economics of channel creation are very unlikely to result in a meaningfully-decentralized mesh network. The highly-centralized (and easily censored) “hub and spoke” model is likely the only one that’s even quasi-viable.  And then there’s the fact that if you actually *did* manage to create a decentralized network of channel connections, the resulting routing problem would likely be unmanageable.  

>Do we need to increase the block size? Yes - we need to fit more channels into the blockchain. >Do we need to do it right now? No - 8 million channels will take time to be created. If people use longer waiting time, we can fit much more.

Why are you assuming that the LN is in any way viable? Where is this LN today with a proven track record of security and convenience? Where are the actual users using it to conduct meaningful economic exchange? Why are you using the promise of this unicorn network that is (and likely always will be) “18 months away” as a justification for crippling the Bitcoin network that actually exists and that actually has (or at least, until recently, had) a proven track record of working extremely well?

>Of course! That's why it's uneconomical for mining majority to attack anything lower than ~13 BTC (or more, if one assumes more confirmations). There's still a difference between being able to inflate and not being ablo to inflate, though.

The reason it’s uneconomical for the mining majority to attack the network is the central premise behind Bitcoin’s security model – the idea that the incentive system will keep a majority of the hash power honest. From the whitepaper:

“If a greedy attacker is able to assemble more CPU power than all the honest nodes, he would have to choose between using it to defraud people by stealing back his payments, or using it to generate new coins. He ought to find it more profitable to play by the rules, such rules that favour him with more new coins than everyone else combined, than to undermine the system and the validity of his own wealth.”

"That argument is based on the belief that modern networks, modern CPUs, and modern disks all struggle in some way with blocks over 1MB. Yet you can stream HD movies though a battery powered handheld phone. If you actually check how much CPU and network a 5 year old computer on the cheapest DSL line uses when running a bitcoin node you would see that there are no bottlenecks in sight anywhere until beyond at least 32MB blocks, and probably far later. Computers, storage, and networking have never been cheaper.

You should be aware that the argument that bigger blocks will cause some kind of collapse of the network are put forward by Luke-jr, who also advocates an immediate block size reduction to 300KB despite the undeniable fact that 1MB blocks have worked perfectly for thousands of nodes for many years now.

"Yeah of course what you just wrote is true, for westerners. Try making your argument in Venezuela, Argentina or India. Also, whether or not a modern infrastructure can handle it or not, is not the crux of the argument. The argument for smaller blocks exists because it will always be easier to evade censorship with smaller blocks, which is one of the highest value propositions for bitcoin.  Moving blocks with stenography or any other means of non traditional coms will always be easier with smaller blocks. Therefore we should have small blocks. 

Please respond to my argument of small blocks in the context of censorship resistance. Otherwise I don’t think you and I have the same concerns or vision of how the future for bitcoin will pan out. 

Once it’s widely accepted then yeah we can start to talk about increasing the block size. 

Otherwise, I’m just not convinced that increasing the block size is in the best interest of Bitcoin.

">    LN does not increase the blockspace. We have had Segwit for a few months and the blocks are still full.

>That's not a measure of blockspace. 1GB blocks will also be full.

Without LN it will be, with LN it may not be. It seems like you still think I am against LNs.



>    It increases the waste by 50% everytime we increase the blocksize.

>What do you mean?

Segwit allows a blockweight of 4 megs. That is 4 megabytes that needs to be stored and transmitted. A 1.7 megabyte block can hold as many transactions as a Segwit block can. It doesn't matter what transactions are being sent, you will never get more transactions in a 1xSegwit block as you can fit in a 1.7 megabyte block. That means we can see 4 megabyte segwit blocks that have less transactions then a 1.7 megabyte non segwit block. 

So what is in the extra 2.3 megabytes? It is bloat. This bloat can be used for things like confidential transactions, but it cannot be used to store more transactions. Did you not know about this?

Every time we increase the blocksize that bloat gets increased too. 2.3 megabytes in 1x will become 4.6 in 2x.";1;1;False;SharpMud;douptov;How Bitcoin Cash was born.;77rviy;https://i.redd.it/z4w99iudn4tz.jpg
