In PoS, the supply of stake is finite at any time and there are no economies of scale (fixed cost are negligible). If I have 0.01% of eth and stake it (under full PoS), there's no way for anyone to make my share lower than 0.01% (unless I voluntarily sell, of course). It can only grow higher than 0.01% if not everyone stakes.  

That's why if PoS starts decentralized, it can stay decentralized infinitely.

GPU mining is still a lot better. Just look at what btc mining devolved into due to specialized hw and cartels. Personally, I started mining on my workstation and followed mining closely, at its height I had 40 GPUs dedicated to btc. Luckily I dodged the ASIC bullet but I saw many people losing all they have worked for thanks to the fraud ridden early mining companies. (Jihan and friends basically got rich exploiting the early miners)

Without the support of the super-majority of the sha256 hashrate, blockstream couldn't have forced the 1MB limit on the protocol, this was made possible only because ASICs caused sub-optimal mining centralization.

Another example of why ASIC mining introduces more risks is the fact that ASIC manufacturing and operation highly favours a single country (China).

"Man, I like you, but this is exactly the kind of hysterics I'm talking about in the article. 

>thank you for giving us four guys complete control over the BCH protocol from now on

Why do you assume that this is motivated out of a desire to control the protocol rather than a good-faith effort to fund the protocol and keep it healthy? Have these guys done anything to make you distrust their motives? I haven't seen anything. Yet I have years and years of experience with them that tells me they are genuinely interested in seeing BCH succeed.

Also, Hong Kong is not at war with China and I'm not sure why you think a sovereignty dispute would mean that suddenly the mainland Chinese government is going to start trying to dictate Bitcoin protocol decisions.

>This is an unacceptable fundamental change to the Bitcoin invention

How is it a fundamental change to the bitcoin invention? The only people who are impacted are the miners. To me this seems quite in line with miners enforcing rules and incentives.

I'm not even a huge fan of the proposal but being hysterical is not helping to have a mature conversation on the actual pros and cons of the matter.

edit: As an addendum, I **wish** the miners had exerted some of the control they've always had years ago. I think they were too worried about upsetting the community and became paralyzed when it came to making the best decisions for the network.

"There is no money to pay developers.. well... It's crypto. There is lots of money, but nobody is paying any of it to Developers to improve the protocol. 

The miners (who have a lot of money invested in BCH) have decided to fund the developers from their pocket.  Only it's not JUST their pocket, they want to ensure that ALL entities that mine BCH will contribute. 

This means that hash that cares nothing for BCH (simply mines and sells it to make money when it is profitable), will also be forced to contribute 12.5% of the block reward.  Thus making it less profitable. 

So those people, will likely go and mine something else like BTC.

This movement of hash power from BCH to BTC, will cause a minor difficulty adjustment, making mining harder on BTC, and easier on BCH. 

Because it's now easier to mine on BCH, it will cost miners less in electricity. Which means, in effect, the 12.5% donation is subsidised some amount , by BTC. Nobody knows how much the hash rate will actually move. 

People are freaking out, because the majority of hash power just decided to do this. And you can't really stop them. 

If they decide to do this, maybe they will decide to do something else. Maybe they will make a hard fork and instead of lasting 6 months it never stops.  

Currently there are multiple developer teams. But if a mining cartel controls all their funding, eventually they may control all the development. 

TLDR, miners are acting unilaterally to donate money to developers.   But people are pissed because miners are acting unilaterally.";10;2;False;barnz3000;ffbncig;What is happening?;esqwel;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/esqwel/what_is_happening/
"Some powerful mining pool operators are planning to tax all BCH miners to provide support to BCH infrastructure and development. This basically forces miners to be BCH heroes whether they want to be or not. If not, I believe they can move to BTC mining.

I think we need the development support badly to get our code ready to allow massive worldwide scaling before we miss that chance by taking too many years to get ready.

The tax seems awfully high to me, but, if 12.5% of hashrate leaves BCH for BTC, maybe the difficulty will lower and the remaining miners will get roughly the same pay spread between fewer miners?

Trolls are active all over social media attacking this idea with lies and deceptive claims. I believe this is because the dark forces' (anti-p2p-cash armies') troll masters are scared of this idea. They claim things like 'the money will be stolen and never reach BCH developers' and 'this will kill BCH'.

There are many concerns about how to implement this and make sure the funds get to the correct places. I have a feeling the people behind this care as much as we do and they will work hard to make this work correctly.

The centralization of mining powers and over-lording behavior this represents is very scary and sets a terrible precedent. I like it this time, but, I expect many will consider this too slippery a slope. I like to think they might eventually find a way to decentralize this funding mechanism with automated payments to development teams or projects.

The miners gathering to make decisions as a group is quite scary, but, was already a thing we all tried not to see. This openness will make it easy for them to act together, and thus, this creates a more serious problem to solve for the future.

Fair? That the minority miners have to give parts of their fees to a private entity, controlled by their competitors, who will decide what R&D to pursue?

What's to say the majority miners won't prioritize development that benefits them but harms the smaller miners? For example pursuing scaling in such a way that block propagation time increases, while increasing the orphaning rates, which harms smaller miners more than large miners?

"Yes, development needs a financial incentive.

Satoshi stopped developing. (see footnote)

His (financial) incentive though, was having mined a shit ton of coins. This is not an option available to today's developers.

They can still be incentivized to develop on BCH by virtue of it having a great community, excellent roadmap, and decent remuneration by companies enjoying the benefits of said development.

None of this implies the necessity of anything other than voluntary transactions, imo.

"I just went ahead and installed the Blockchain wallet to see what the UI on this is like, and interestingly it doesn't.

It asks you for an email address and a password, then a 4 digit pin. Then you're done. Most users in that scenario are expecting to be able to do password recovery to their email, Every other service you sign up to that takes an email and password does password recovery.

Most other wallets I've tried do exactly what you say, gives you seed words, explains to you what they are. Tells you to write them down and store them somewhere safe, and then makes you re-enter them to ensure you really did write them down. The Blockchain.info app does not do this.

Bonus ducks: Now when I try to open the app and enter my pin, it says ""Unexpected error, please try again later"", so even while knowing my password and my pin I'm unable to access my wallet...not that I care of course, it's empty and I only created it to have a look at the UI.

It's not an *organization*. It would be bad enough if it would be just *one* central organization that is being formed to dictate the BCH protocol rules, but it's even worse. It's just one newly formed *company*.

> Discussion where?

**Behind closed doors and we're not invited and our financial interests are dictatorially ignored.** We're just expected to buy the coins that Jiang Zhuoer and his cartel of miners mine with their altered protocol rules and shut up with no public debate. Yeah right, that's not going to happen! 

**As a currency speculator this sudden power grab by four people** (Jiang, Jihan, Haipo and Roger) whose new tax plan I was not allowed to at least debate here in /r/btc first, **is a very strong sell signal for me.** I don't recognize the unacceptable and dictatorial attitudes of Jiang Zhuoer and whoever Deng Xiaoping is. This unnamed Hong Kong company smells very similar to the Blockstream company so we should not give control over the BCH protocol rules to *one single company* ever again. It's much better to keep the control (and funding) decentralized in as many companies (and other types of BCH participants) as possible like it's been so far for BCH.

Quotes from **Jiang Zhuoer's mandatory tax plan protocol change:**

""The chief architect of the Chinese ‘reform and opening-up’ policy–Deng Xiao Ping has three famous insights: Cat Philosophy, River Philosophy and **Non-debate theory**.""

[..]

""Non-debate theory：Non-debate theory is my invention. Non-debate, is to gain time to work hard. When you debate, everything becomes more complicated and it wastes time. Nothing can be done. **Don’t debate, and just try.** Be brave and experiment.""

""**I think Deng Xiaoping well said.** Nobody is the Omnipotent God. “When you debate, everything becomes more complicated and it wastes time. Nothing can be done. **Don’t debate**, and just try, be brave and experiment” This debate has been long enough, instead of continuing this pointless debate, why not give it a try.""

""Therefore, various major BCH mining pools (BTC.TOP, Antpool, BTC.com, ViaBTC, Bitcoin.com) are preparing to implement a 6-month short-term donation plan.""

[..]

""A Hong Kong **corporation** has been set up to legally accept and disperse funds.The funds would be used to pay for development contributions to full node implementations as well as other critical infrastructure.""

[..]

""**miners will orphan BCH blocks that do not follow the plan.**""

[..]

""There is **no** “masternode” **voting or any other voting**.""

[..]

""**The initiative is under the direction and control of the miners**""

"*The problem with ""mining pays for development"" is it has the completely opposite effect as intended and instead significantly reduces developer investment and interest in the chain. The reason is simple, when there is a developer tax then only the developers on the payroll will spend time on the chain. All other developers across the world who are not on the payroll will not spend time on the chain. Why would you when another group is receiving money and controls the repo?\*\*The miner funds effectively become a cap on investment, which forever limits the chain. And that assumes the centralized group who receives the funds are competent and efficient, if not its even worse.*

*This is definitely a sell-the-chain type event IMHO. Which has the benefit of allowing BSV to effectively flip and that event will force a lot of people to take a hard look at BSV and re-evaluate their positions.*

How would you comment on my criticism that I wrote yesterday?

Source:

https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/esebco/infrastructure_funding_plan_for_bitcoin_cash_by/ff9mqpb/

I'll copy the content of that comment here too:

""**I'm against this plan.**

**It wasn't properly publicly debated first.**  
It's a very risky major change to the protocol.  
It seems temporary but could become permanent.  
BU should get 0 USD in (forced) ""donations"". Will they?  
This is bad for BCH.  

""[..], miners will orphan BCH blocks that do not follow the plan.[..]""

This seems like a power move by the miners to increase their influence and control over the BCH protocol. I really hope that I'm wrong about that and that this forced funding will turn out better than how the Blockstream, Bitcoin Foundation, and Nchain funding has turned out.

Infrastructure funding should be voluntary, not a part of the BCH protocol.

This whole situation reminds me of how companies underfunded internal IT departments in 1990-2000 (and many still today) because they just couldn't understand how increasingly important IT had become to their own companies. The companies that understood this and spent a very significant amount of money on ""internal IT costs"" became so profitable and grew so large that they eventually became like Facebook that tries to create its own private currency now.

And why base the company that's going to decide where the ""donated"" money goes, in Hong Kong? Isn't that unnecessarily risky considering that China seems to be in a war with Hong Kong trying to make it just another part of China? China seems much more unfriendly even hostile towards the Bitcoin invention than a sovereign Hong Kong.

"I welcome the initiative, and thank you for bringing the plan public.

I've been in the space though all controversies since the block size debate on BTC began. My first reaction to this proposal is suspicion, and I'm guessing others feel the same.

If this plan is sincere, it will tolerate the light of day (i.e public criticism). We have seen divisions in the community over less controversial proposals. This will be used by trolls to form division, I'm sure. 

Taking the time to communicate this idea to the wider audience is critical, in order to not risk splitting the community or driving people away due to perceived risk of another takeover.

I understand that we don't want politics (non-debate policy), but objective argumentation should be the foundation here. Consider criticism valuable feedback, but don't let it cloud your judgement. Miners carrying their responsibility and taking initiative is a good thing, which was lacking in BTC when it would have made a difference.

"The 5 entities mentioned in the article have over the past 7 days controlled under 35% of hash power. Coin Dance shows the BCH network is currently operating with a 1.6% profitability over BTC.

What is being proposed here will drop the profitability of BCH mining by a whopping 12.5%. Since the entities mentioned all appear to be pools (according to Coin Dance), has it been considered that the actual miners will shift their hash power to another chain? Why would a miner continue to mine an unprofitable chain for 6 months? If you believe that this forced donation (miners' income tax) will run only for 6 months - because temporary taxation rarely expires.

With such low hash power behind this proposal and the enforced taxation of mining activity (under pain of orphans), you run the risk of forking yourselves off the chain and creating a new Taxcoin fork.

"Mr Jiang,

I've just woken up and found this news. I've read your post and most of the comments. 

Before discussing the merits of the proposal, I salute most positively that miners take initiative. This is a very good signal. It is also very good that miners care about infrastructure and want to find a way to fund it. 

Going on to the merit. If I understand correctly, it's a proposal coming from the majority of BCH miners, that have already agreed on the spirit of it. 

To anyone looking from outside, anything enforced by the majority of miners is a rule. If it's an attack, depends on the honesty of the miners. *honesty* is a real-world concept, and is subjective really. 

The thing is, miners hold *a lot* of power. Going along with the community is important, as well as reputation. 

I really appreciate the delicate balance of incentives. It's really well thought out!

I haven't made my mind on this yet, but I have a couple of suggestions.

Mainly, this is a strict rule miners enforce. It *is* a protocol change - people not following *will* be orphaned. Make it into a hard-fork, and don't be ambiguous about it. 

Secondly, anyone is welcome to lead any initiative in BCH, and anyone is welcome to follow any initiative in BCH. You find yourself in the very delicate position of also being a miner - community consensus matters! If you go ahead and pull it off in some version of it, try your best to involve the community in this. This is the main thing I blame on ABC around the time of the BSV fork (I largely support ABC btw).

"Indeed it is closer to a cartel. Although three observations.

1. If stakeholders disagree they can move hash into BCH that refuses to implement cartel consensus. This has the risk of effectively becoming a hard fork but if the cartel consensus is enabled by a switch it may work more like normal equilibrium theory games of utility.

2. The details implementation of cartel rules is critical. If they add it as a switch on block validity generally rather than via special code for deciding which block to mine upon then it effectively is a hard fork and the switch is basically pointless as will be left to the default. Think exchanges use of nodes.

"> A tax is a compulsory contribution to state revenue. If you do not comply, government agents will lock you in a cage. 

Actually, if you create nothing and spend nothing then there is no compulsory contribution.

So what you meant to write is that taxes is a percentage taken from people that earn money or spend money.

So, much like with the bch taxation proposal, if you don't create blocks, you don't have to pay the tax.

What the cartel pinky promises to do with the money is functionally irrelevant, this is a shake down and the creation of a China based centralised taxation authority and if not adequately resisted could easily split BCH into oblivion.

Majority hash does not grant a status of infallible god hood that makes said cartel incapable of making poor choices or outright fuckups that could harm bitcoin.

A majority of hash chose to allow Blockstream to take control of BTC and choke adoption and growth by crippling transactional capacity.

"I want to comment on the ""tax"" thing.  I agree it's really not a tax, although it may ""feel"" like a tax, but let's look at that.  We know that the miners will get 5.46875 BCH instead of 6.25 BCH.  So you can say they will miss 0.78125 BCH per block, and that is real money they are missing.  But, this reduced profitability will then cause some miners to drop out, making blocks slower, which will cause the difficutly to adjust, making each miner get more solved blocks.  This is how mining always works.  

The same mechanism that has people talking about relying only on fees in the long run , means that less block rewards generally mean security, not reduced profitability.  Profitability always tends toward zero overall, with the most efficient mining operations making money.  You could say it is slightly accelerating or exacerbating this, so it could be seen as a ""tax on hash security.""

That would all be true for a single bitcoin chain. Now on a multi chain scenario such as the one we're in, basically the same thing happens -- there is a reduction in security but not in profitability.  

The twist in the multicoin scenario is:  for miners who want to only mine BCH (rather than switch), they don't have to suffer, since the difficulty increase comes on BTC mostly.  Contrast this with a non-orphaning strategy, in which case SOME BCH-only mining would be getting paid less than others without any difficulty adjustment relief.  *That* would be more of a tax.";8;0;False;jonald_fyookball;ffb8iom;The Miner-Activated Infrastructure Fund is nothing to worry about.

"Hi.

I’ve been in Bitcoin since late 2012. I railed against Blockstream, the Theymos censorship and all the small blocker madness.

This is a mining cartel proposing to 51% attack the BCH chain if their competitors don’t pay 12.5% of their income to an address they control.

What the cartel pinky promises to do with the money is functionally irrelevant, this is a shake down and if not adequately resisted could easily split BCH into oblivion.

Your main argument seems to be that having a majority of hash grants a status of infallible god hood that makes said cartel incapable of making poor choices or outright fuckups that could harm bitcoin.

That is ridiculous. That is already proven to be wrong.

A majority of hash chose to allow Blockstream to take control of BTC and choke adoption and growth by crippling transactional capacity.

I'm not attributing godhood, I'm attributing a moral right to make tough decisions. You signed up for this system; Namely, miners being in control via their POW.

We're in this experiment together, but if you don't like the miners making their own decisions, then you've got to come up with something else.

"Assumptions...

Assume the hash that will support is 3%. That would mean (math... someone knows better than I) that to be consistently overpower that 3% 6% (or more?) of the BTC hash would need to come over for an extended period of time, not just for 10 quick blocks (I am thinking solely along the lines of reorg) Because once that 6% of BTC hash power leaves then the remaining 3% will just keep moving forward. And if that 6% mines at a loss, then they're being stupid, right?

That 6% (or more) would have to stay long term and that would do something (I don't know what) with the value proposition to both chain's tokens. But if that 6% stays long enough it really hurts the BTC chain because they do not adjust their difficulty as fast as BCH. Losing 6% (or more) of their hash rate for an extended period of time extends the length of time until they reach the point in which they readjust their difficulty.

Development is slow, complex development on a global financial infrastructure even more. I can cite tons of examples from BCH history where development of features has been slower than originally anticipated. It applies not only to protocol dev.

"I believe the proposal is great, but with one major setback, a setback that might kill a coin, and therefore has to be fixed: 

The power this Honk-Kong-based company possess becomes quite considerable. 12.5% of all mining rewards goes to it, and it has the power to direct this money anywhere.    
Since this company is controlled by the biggest miners, it creates a huge power-shift from small miners to big miners.   
It becomes disproportionately profitable to mine as a miner that is part of the consortium. Even if they don't get the money directly, they get to chose who does get the money, allowing them to push their interests over other's interests.

They must allow the miner to decide himself to whom he donates the money. 

Indeed, giving the miner complete freedom whether he wants to donate or not creates tragedy of the commons. But in-between solution can exist.

From the top of my head, a couple half-baked ideas for such:

1. Have a list of accepted donation addresses (such as ABC team, various companies building on top, various companies that later redistribute the money(such as the aforementioned Hong-Kong company, etc.). This list can be community-managed in some way.

"No one should be surprised by this. BCH was 51% attacked back in May, and the Bitcoin ABC team almost all abruptly quit back in May due to lack of funding before - guess who! - Roger Ver stepped in and provided funds. You think Roger wants he and his businesses to continually be the sole provider of funding for Bitcoin ABC? Nope. He knows keeping them funded is *vital* to BCH though so he has/had no choice.

So, I can almost guarantee this is a plot hatched by Roger Ver to save himself money while fundamentally changing what BCH is. It's devious but brilliant, and no one here will call him out on it and he knows it. He's changing the protocol to save himself money. 

Keep in mind: Roger Ver ONLY acts in his own self interest, and ONLY cares about making money. Everything can be traced back to those two things. He's the shadow leader of BCH and can literally do whatever he wants with the BCH protocol. And, even if people woke up to that reality it *wouldn't matter* because without Roger, BCH collapses. Not because it can't stand on it's own merits, but because he is almost single-handedly propping up BCH with hash rate and money that otherwise would be non-existent and BCH would be constantly attacked and manipulated, making it basically worthless.

For those curious about the backstory on the Bitcoin ABC team *almost* quitting that would've effectively ended BCH back in May:

">All industries have ""potentially infinite economies of scale""

That's not true. Adding levels to a building is a simple example: above some height, adding new levels is a net loss, as every level below has to be strengthened.  

>In this case, another miner can come along and drop another $5B on mining equipment and capture half of that $1B and both companies would still be break-even capturing $0.5B in block rewards and spending $0.5B on operational costs.

That doesn't disprove economies of scale, as identical companies would have identical per unit cost. The problem is that the cost per unit of hash power is lower for bigger miners, as all marginal costs decrease. Even racks are cheaper in wholesale.  

What's additionally special to PoW is that a >51% miner can orphan blocks of any new competitor, so any new entrant would have to start with a majority. Even if some succeeds, the situation can only repeat. This means a chain of different monopolies.

>the original miner would have some advantage in expertise

Advantage from being the first is different from economies of scale. They exist too, mostly in the form of more amortized capital expenditures, especially things like designing and making an ASIC.

>but also power sources are limited

As long as miners don't buy their own power plants, that's not relevant as everyone pays the same in the same location. Power cost is not a part of the economies of scale above a minimum size of miner (above hobby home miner).  
If miners start building power plants local limits are no longer a concern.  
There are some physical limits on power density but they're way, way too large to matter.

>especially given that it's been over 10 years now and the evidence is that it does not.  

The evidence is that it is.

"All industries have ""potentially infinite economies of scale"". The equilibrium comes when supply equals demand. The demand for mining in the case of PoW is limited by the block difficultly, i.e. X BTC per block. The supply is limited by the mining hardware capabilities.

Here's a simple example: Suppose that BCH is providing miners with $1B per year. That is the revenue for the entire industry. Suppose 1 miner is capturing all of it using, for example, $5B worth of mining equipment with $0.5B in operational costs. In this case, another miner can come along and drop another $5B on mining equipment and capture half of that $1B and both companies would still be break-even capturing $0.5B in block rewards and spending $0.5B on operational costs.

Another way to think about it: There is potential for competitors in any profitable industry if a new competitor is willing to make a smaller margin or out-compete.

">In order for something to be ""decentralized"" it has to be centralized first

You're trolling and you know it.  
Decentralization is a spectrum: how many different entities have to cooperate to hijack the system - censor transactions, or even arbitrarily change state (if technically possible). Maximum centralization needs one entity, maximum decentralization needs all users (ie. the change requires a hard fork and everyone can choose to stay on the old version).  

Under sha256 pow, currently there's one entity: [the government of China](https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-mining-centralization-record-levels-majority-china/). Therefore, it's centralized.  
Barring the government of China, a very small (one or double digit) number of miners and pools is needed - as shown by the new mining tax. The non conforming blocks are going to be orphaned by the cartel, meaning it's forced on users.  

PoS can realistically start with decentralization on the level of thousands of different entities. The government is a much smaller danger, as contrary to registered mining companies with enormous mining farms, the nodes are just normal pcs, or even smartphones that can be used anonymously under tor.";0;0;False;nootropicat;ffb5gaz;"Vitalik: ""BCH, a chain that was born as a reaction to an ideology that claims that soft forks are the only legitimate way to make changes because they are ""voluntary"" is.... making a controversial soft fork and insinuating that it's voluntary""";esl5fn;https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1220141612384182272

That's not true. According to the BTC.top articleit will go to a ""Hong Kong Corporation"" with literally no objective promises or guarantees. It may, if things work out exactly as hoped, lead to developers indirectly receiving funding. But it will not be going directly to developers.

It should be noted that such a smart contract could likely be written to directly fund developers; it was not done in this fashion.

Not exactly. Again, it depends on how the software is coded. For example, the way the ""dev funding plan"" is authored to work now, miners will ""orphan"" blocks not compliant. This means full-node software doesn't need to contain code executing the plan. On upgrade day the participating miners simply include a mining patch that synchronizes them with the orphaning process. The rest of the ecosystem continues as normal (with whatever is included in the current HF).

So you're saying that the exchange would do 1in 10+out transactions, which are cheap for the users. However, that means that each output is always smaller than input (it can't be bigger for sure). Having only such transactions would eventually lead to 100% of BTC outputs that are smaller than transaction fees, so at some point someone needs to consolidate outputs into this 1 output again which is going to be very expensive, as you correctly noted. Who is going to do it? An exchange?

I'm not missing that at all. I'm very aware.  But inputs are much, much heavier than outputs.  This is because each input requires a digital signature, which is the largest part of the tx. 

However, in my example, I only spoke about adding extra outputs, not extra inputs.  So the txs I was talking about will not be that large. They get us a lot more bang for the buck.

I never said anything about 100 inputs, as I explained above.  But let's talk about that anyway. Once signature aggregation is implemented, those 100 inputs will have just one combined digital signature, instead of 100 separate digital signatures.

"You're missing something here. The block size limit is not about the number of transactions, but rather a number of **bytes in a block** (it's a bit more complex with weight, but generally it's bytes). 

So, the actual cap is **not** 400 000 transactions of **any** size, but 400 000 transactions of a **typical** size. 

If all of the transactions suddenly became 100 inputs 200 outputs (heavy use of batching) instead of 1 input 2 outputs - the cap would plummet from 400 000 typical tx per day to 4 000 huge transactions per day, because the size of each transaction would be about 100 times bigger, therefore it would take 100 times more size in a block. Ok, it would be a bit more effective, since a transaction with 100 inputs and 200 outputs would be probably about [5-10% more effective](https://read.cash/@Read.Cash/whats-in-a-bitcoin-cash-transaction-2545473c) than 100 transactions of 1-in 2-outs, but that's about it - there are onlye a few bytes that you don't need to repeat (see the link).

But here's the problem. You're creating 100x bigger transactions, so the space is only available for 4000 (maybe 5000) such transactions in a day, therefore $17m / 4000 tx = $4250 transaction fee per transaction, which would be divided between 100 participants, each still paying about $42 fee.

So, the more you stuff in a transaction - the bigger the fee you have to pay based on your bytes. $42 is the base, not the upper limit.

**UPDATE:** Let's calculate it another way, using bytes: the biggest block BTC has ever produced is [2377KB](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/blocks?q=&s=size%28desc%29), you have 144 blocks per day - that's 2377*144=342288 KB per day - that's about the hard limit, which must be paid with $17m (currently).  So, each byte's price is $17m/342288 KB ~ $0.05 per each byte. That means that a typical 224 bytes transaction costs $11.20, it's better than original estimate, but it still means that if you withdraw money - that's 224 bytes ($11.20), if on top of that you want to batch and open a channel - that's about 224 bytes more (+$11.20), if you want to also batch in 100 friends - each of their things (opening channels, sending to hw wallet) is at least $11.20 each.";1;1;False;readcash;ffbpd1b;BTC fees endgame: $40+;eska86;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/eska86/btc_fees_endgame_40/

The current level of mining is mostly wasteful and since their price will be lower then (due to better competition) mining competition will be less intense.

Most of the mircopayment use cases rely on instant txs.  So ""taking longer"" and ""maybe eventual confirmation"" is just bad tech that will not become a standard.

Lightning was specifically designed for truly instant settlement and fees in the range of ten millionths of a cent.  On chain txs simply cannot compete with that use case.

If micro txs ever become a thing (like paying by the byte for streaming services) it will be done with something like Lightning, not 10 minute (or longer) confirmation on-chain txs for a half a cent each.

Also, saving every single one of these minuscule txs to a blockchain, for the end of time, is simply not a scalable solution.  Forget 32mb blocks.  You'd need GB blocks, and it would just be filled up with txs moving fractions of a cent.  What a worthless use for a blockchain.

The lever it has to coerced donations gives it ""editorial"" control over the network. And that sort of control is what triggers the financial KYC/AML laws. Right now miners are protected because they don't have the power to censor blocks. So they don't have that sort of editorial control. At most a country could tell a miner to not confirm any blocks with txout A included and that one miner would fork off. But with this new cartel if the government of Hong Kong says tx output A is illegal don't confirm it. This corporation has the ability to censor the whole chain. And if it doesn't follow through it's assets (all those coerced ""donations"") can be siezed.

"Allow me to assert some reasons why it's terrible.

1. The introduction of counterparty risk. Want Bitcoin (BCH) to succeed. You just now trust that **one** counterparty controlled by 4 entities, 3 in the same jurisdiction is going to ""just do the right thing"".
2. What happens when you want to develop some feature that's against what the mining cartel wants? What happens  when you speak out against say, Hong Kong's extradition law? What happens when a Tibetan wants to develop for BCH and can't be funded because the controlling interest are all under a Communist regime? Guess what, you're fucked. There no governance here.
3. What happens when the Chinese government approaches the cartel and says, ""Orphan blocks from with transactions from this list of addresses""? Blacklists. This cartel won't have an excuse to not do this. They literally do the same thing already for their own profit.
4. Where the audit guarantees to see how the coin is used? Notably missing.
5. Why not an SLP token that funds development? There are better ways to do this sort of funding.
6. Leaders of this movement are ""anti-voting"" (their article). How much do you want to bet that miners other than the big 4 will have zero say in how the funds are used?
7. Want a sure fire way to blunt this recent momentum? Here you go! Let's just go ahead and implement **everything we criticised BSV for*.
8. This acts as a 12.5% hashpwer penalty against Bitcoin Cash. The absolute worst thing we could do going into Bitcoins (BTC's) halving. We need to be competitive! Not self defeating.
9. Development is currently happening in BCH at a good pace! Of miners believe they need more development why don't they find development of these projects themselves! We don't need to implement a taxation system.
10. There are zero details on the corporate structure for this new counterparty. Zero.

"To the folks who think this is ""taxation"" or ""theft""....I believe it is not.

In summary:

The profit the miners make before the implementation of this plan and after the implementation will be roughly the same.

However, if it was pure voluntary, then for the miners who do volunteer, they would actually see their profit decrease.

Long version:

Yes, 12.5% of the coinbase disappears...just like how the halvings take 50% away...the miners will reduce hashrate to keep the profitability the same.

You can argue that the 12.5% would have gone to raising the hashrate had it not been taken.  So in a sense BCH is trading hashrate for development work.  

The perfect proof of this would be to look at the money the miners take home after they pay their bills before and after this 12.5% plan is implemented.  

I think the miners will have the same income because the 12.5% will be taken away from the hashrate - not their pockets.

That is why it is important for *all* miners to participate otherwise, certain miners will have a lower hashrate which *will* show up as a loss in income.

*This plan will result in 12.5% drop in hashrate for BCH and NOT reduce the profits of the miners.*

"""one-CPU-one-vote""

The white paper *clearly* defines 'CPU power' as a common-commodity, like dirt or air. There is no conception of specialized mining equipment, aside an off-hand comment that 'miners violating protocol rules would jeopardize their own investment costs'.

I'm not bible-thumping the white paper at you, but you WELL KNOW that the white paper intended *hash power* to be a globally distributed good, not a specialized asset, acquired by cartels.

You are also well aware that the white paper warns against organized mining operations controlling 'more than 15%' and effectively says Bitcoin is over when they control '40%' or something like that (the final page or two detail this in stats charts).

I applaud some BCH innovative techniques (such as stopping reorgs beyond 10 blocks), but *misrepresenting* the white paper *grossly* is well below your person - it's disgusting.

I will also add some realism, which is glossed over, that this *centralized body* of money will not *actually* fund 'distributed developers' but instead will be equally as effective as Gov in general, which is to say ~90% will be used to fund bureaucratic insiders.

What is the election process for those running this $6 Mil fund? Who gets to participate? How long are they elected for? etc, etc.

And this 'temporary' tax will surely become permanent. No way around that.

So basically you'll have ~50% of miners (the bureaucrat cartel) getting paid a 10% bonus for mining BCH, with outsiders getting paid less. This naturally thwarts competition, and leads to retention of power and increased dissatisfaction.

I *do* believe 'bitcoin activists' should be paid via a block reward. I *do believe* it should be substantial (I say 25% at least). But I do not believe an acceptable political system exists today which fits the *decentralized, distributed* ethos of Bitcoin, in terms of distribution of said funds. I have a proposal you can read about, but all the same.

If my proposal was accepted, the miners would quite this motion - why? Because they'd then have nothing to gain.

It's **obvious** the only reason they are exerting efforts and money to back this proposal is because there are moneys to be made enacting it.

"> this migrating hash power has the effect of _increasing_ difficulty on BTC/BSV, thereby reducing BTC/BSV mining profitability slightly.  The equilibrium is that _all_ the SHA256 miners become slightly less profitable by an amount proportional to the value moved to the dev fund (all else being equal).

"Regardless of whether this is 'morally right' or not, I'd like to give one comment on the technical mechanism which sounds like is being proposed:

**If this were only enforced by miners (miner soft fork) rather than as a network-wide rule, it would be highly dangerous.**

Miner soft forks are simply not a good idea on BCH for a variety of reasons, including the fact that ABC nodes don't follow the longest chain. Here is one scenario, there are many others:

1. Suppose we start in the usual steady state where BCH is being mined at 2.6% or whatever on average.
2. Everyone has experienced that the 'steady state' is not really steady at all. There heavy daily DAA feedback oscillations which have incentivised switch miners and discouraged steady miners, and so every day the actual hashrate falls far below 2.6%.
3. Suppose some other mining pool X with \~1% hashrate waits until the hashrate from 'normal miners' has fallen to a low level < 1%.
4. The X pool then mines a chain of \~5 blocks without the infrastructure funding output.
5. If this is only a miner enforced soft fork, then regular nodes will happily accept the X chain. They don't know about this new rule (if they did, it would be a consensus rule).
6. The plan-following miners have orphaned these X blocks, and now they either have to admit defeat (by following the X chain) or try to win. Let's suppose they are programmed to never give up. When they come back they will be mining on an old tip. As far as regular nodes are concerned, they only see that this chain is a deliberate reorg and it as far as they can tell, it might as well be an attack.
7. When the plan-following miners do build their chain, now it has to be 2x longer than the X chain. This is because of ABC nodes' ""parking/unparking rule"", where reorgs of >3 blocks require 2x the proof of work. So, they're at a serious disadvantage.
8. Not only that, but if the plan-following miners do not respond very quickly and in force, then they will lose permanently. This is because of ABC nodes' ""finalization rule"", where reorgs of >10 blocks are never considered. To reach this point the X pool needs only 5 more blocks, whereas the plan-followers would have to get 20 blocks before that happens (due to parking).
9. So, it could happen that all ABC nodes (which as far as I can right now are the primary economically relevant ones in the ecosystem) only follow the X chain without infrastructure fund, and that the plan-following miners have been orphaned off onto another chain. Even if they add more proof of work and eventually get the longest chain, they will only bring over nodes that follow the longest chain, and not ABC nodes. If they keep this up and stay at a longer work than X chain, then the network will be permanently split.

Actually I think that in attempting a miner soft fork on a minority chain is in general not a good idea. It's just a particularly bad idea on BCH.";42;7;False;markblundeberg;ffapqej;Infrastructure Funding Plan for Bitcoin Cash by Jiang Zhuoer (BTC.TOP);esebco;https://medium.com/@jiangzhuoer/infrastructure-funding-plan-for-bitcoin-cash-131fdcd2412e

Worst case the money is collected and wasted and in 6 months we go back to the drawing board. Best case this enables faster roll-out of features that make BCH more valuable, the value of the fund grows (I'm assuming it's held in BCH) and pays for even more features, and the fund itself is perpetuated to the end of the need for protocol development.

I am personally strongly against developer but I read the medium post and I like it, he made sensible arguments and the “developper tax” is limited in time (The only conditions I would found dev tax acceptable is if they are time limited or deflating)

I have no worries that it will become a permanent protocol rules.. it is not like miner are giving themselves extra reward, they are actually donating reward away.

Their short term financial incentives is to stop it after the six months not continuing with it.

I find it interesting to see miner taking positive action to support a chain for once, they have been extremely passive before.

"Right, and the whole angle of ""all SHA256 miners will bear the cost"" is a wierd take at best - it's not that miners bear the cost, it's holders getting less security for the same pay. 

Sure there's less money for SHA256 miners, as is the case on halvings for example. Some might need to turn off unprofiable miners, and less hashpower will secure the SHA256 coins. 

But - it doesn't spread, only the coin that went through halving (or a new dev tax) will lose hash rate, the others will get the same. 

In the case of halving, holders lose security but also pay just half. In the case of a dev tax, they get less hashrate, but still pay the same.

What's especially anoying is how the miners behind this forced tax pretend to be ""donors"" where in fact they bear almost no cost (this *does* spread as they can and do mine all coins) - 

while softforking into the protocol a mandatory payment, out of the block reward, to an hardcoded address of their Hong Kong entity.

Again, the block reward is a payment holders make to miners in order to buy security. They pay with inflation. If they get less security for the same payment - it is they that are the donors. Not the miners that just give less hasrate in return.

and certainly not the miners signed on this plan, that forcefully take a piece of the block reward, a sacred part of the protocol, with the influence it buys them as the new patron-of-the-devs, all without ""donating"" anything. 

The holders that actually sponser this, get new overlords in the form of a self appointed centrelised entity that gets paid in-protocol and will inevitably become the Ethereum Foundation of Bitcoin Cash. 

At least in Ethereum or Zcash the founders-reward went to .. founders. What makes these few fellas worthy of the honor? The fact that they identify as BCH miners? That they can 51% attack the network? Any 1-2% of the total hashrate can.

/u/todu this part is specifically for you, but anyone else can comment (obviously)
Regardless of our disagreement I still respect your opinion. 

This issue is... wow... At first glance this is exactly what Bitcoin is supposed to do. The miners control the hash, the miners make the decisions since they have skin-in-the-game. But at the same time this could be seen as a hostile takeover.

What would you say (just a hypothetical) if the current BCH miners (that mine consistently on the BCH) were to signal their intent to perform this and that intent was signaled by, say, 75%, of that hash power. 

Understand I do not mean hash power that only mines when it is convenient for them. Honestly, not even sure if it s even possible to determine whether specific hash has left/returned.

What are the specifics of the makeup of the corporation?

Will that information be made available? 

Will there be any non-miner representation on the Board? 

How will this corporation decide to disburse funds? 

Will there be developers on the Board?

Will votes by the Board be made public?

What is the standard for being allowed to ask for funds for development?

Are all the funds going to go to the development of Avalanche?

I've spoken with insiders at the Ethereum Foundation, Consensys, and the Zcash Foundation, and they tell me their foundations are wastes of money and produce little value, because the leadership doesn't know what to spend the money on.

Do you trust the leadership of this fund to know what to spend the money on?

Absent good leadership, who actually knows what to do, what you end up with is **feeding politics**. The money goes to people who climb the social ladder. The ones who look good on Twitter, and don't do any actual work.

You know, the ones like Blockstream.

This money will feed those people. And they will grow large, like a cancer. You don't want to feed a cancer.

Fuck this plan. It's a bad idea. It will leave a bad taste in the mouths of anyone using Bitcoin Cash, because they know that part of their money is going to feed a bunch of political bullshit. It's feeding a cancer that stifles real development.

"Thanks for the thoughts on a miner soft-fork. I agree it's an undesirable way to go. So let's just make it a full hard-fork. That's the point of hard-forks, and our community embracing them, it's all opt in. That answers the moral question. People can sell their BCH at any time prior to, during, or after the fork if desired, or buy more, same with mining. It's all opt-in and free market.

"I think there is some room for nuance here.

If a bunch of miners decide together to start orphaning certain blocks based on rules they think should be enforced on the network then that should be their right. In the end, the concept that miners decide what ends up in a block and which blocks are build upon is one of the core principles of bitcoin (including the ability to have 51% attacks and the incentives to stop miners from doing that). Especially the coinbase transaction is very much a miner area.

Whatever anyone might think about the people making this decision, bitcoin is an open protocol and anyone can join and determine if they agree or not with certain rules. In the end the majority decides: the majority of miners decide what happens within a chain (i.e. within a certain set of consensus rules) and the users decide which set of consensus rules to follow and what makes a chain a chain (which is how we did end up with BCH, but also think about the UASF movement, by which I mean running UASF nodes, not a bunch of spam on Twitter, involving people potentially forking themselves off the majority chain).

Hence, however I might think about it personally, I see this as a valid move within the bitcoin ecosystem. Just as it would be valid for a bunch of other miners (pools, potential hashrate on BTC and individual miners being able to switch pool) to completely ignore these orphaning attempts (and a lot of wasted hashrate in the process) if they can find a new majority against this move.

_**However**_

If it turns out that enforcing this new developer fee will be baked in the new hardfork-ready releases of ABC & BU as part of the new consensus rules (and enabled by default) I think the BCH community should have a deep think about what was so wrong about how Core handled the SegWit soft-fork. Because people _will_ update to those new consensus rules (with or without realizing what they are doing) and you either end up with a chain-split or just nobody daring to go against the new rules. Again, this might give flashbacks to another soft-fork.

Whatever you think of the new proposal, whether you think it is finally a real way forward for this coin or some socialist tax from another world, I really think we should get this bit right. I've always seen the concept of being permissionless one if the core ideals if BCH. This includes miners being absolutely free to decide what they mine. But if this turns out to be a real change in default consensus rules as implemented in the main full node implementations together with the other specs for the hardfork I feel we are taking the wrong route.

---

NOTE: The second bit above is pure speculation: I have no idea what different full node teams are up to. Just trying to distinguish between two ways of looking at the concept of a soft-fork and with that trying to find a way between opinions/feelings that might seem contrary to each other but maybe in reality aren't?

**TL;DR:** Permissionless means miners should be able to decide among themselves and for themselves what blocks they mine and extend. Whether others agree or not: the majority decides, that is bitcoin. However if those debates and decisions start to enter into and influence other parts of the ecosystem it might turn into something different and go against the permissionless nature of the blockchain.";1;1;False;nuc1e4r5n4k3;ffauadb;Infrastructure Funding Plan for Bitcoin Cash by Jiang Zhuoer (BTC.TOP);esebco;https://medium.com/@jiangzhuoer/infrastructure-funding-plan-for-bitcoin-cash-131fdcd2412e

- Digital cash is the goal (ultimate goal being financial freedom and prosperity),
- The project that wins the “medium of exchange” game will win the “store of value” game in the long run.
- To win “medium of exchange” people need to **earn** crypto for their day job. Earn -> spend-> repeat
- Dash provides the best prospects for people to earn crypto regularly (through the Dash “treasury”).

Also, the tech in Dash is ahead of everyone for use as a medium of exchange.  Someone recently made a comparison table, which I just posted to r/dashpay so I could refer you to it.

"Not all protocol level changes are hard forks.

The defining question is whether ""old"" nodes that haven't adopted the new rules will still see the new-rules chain as valid, and therefore they will be able to automatically follow it.

Miners can't enforce a hard fork because they can't force you to upgrade your node. Miners en masse do however have the power to enforce a soft fork, but only on a cryptocurrency where the the other nodes will follow the longest valid chain (as they see it). And if they are the only one demanding these rules, they must keep consistent pressure and stay as ""king of the hill"" so to speak, so that they keep beating back alternate chains that are only valid under old rules.

"As someone who dropped Bitcoin for Monero over this issue long before Bitcoin Cash even existed, I do agree with the premise that Bitcoin will loose its position of dominance if it cannot scale on the base layer. I also agree that LN will not work if the base layer does not scale. In Bitcoin to be blunt this means increasing the blocksize. 

The real question is which coin will replace Bitcoin? It is far from clear that Bitcoin Cash will be the one. Yes it does have the largest market cap of the potential candidates, but there are also many Bitcoin maximalists that have no use for Bitcoin Cash, but have not bothered to extract and sell their BCH. They are in effect propping up the value of BCH. The same can also be said regarding BSV. In this case there are also many Bitcoin Cash supporters that have not extracted and sold their BSV and are in effect also propping up the price of BSV. 

I have made my bet on Monero based upon two things:

1) An adaptive blocksize where scaling the base layer does not become a political decision.

2) A minimum perpetual block reward of 0.6 XMR per 2min block. The equivalent for BTC, or BCH would be approximately 3 BTC or BCH per 10 min block. This means that the block size does not have to be restricted in order to cause fees to rise. Regardless of whether this is done by a mining cartel or at the protocol level the result is the same. Fees go up and commerce is stymied just like Bitcoin.  

If Bitcoin Cash is serious it needs to address the above two issues with actual code working on the main chain not just vague promises. By the way a 32 MB block size limit today is actually smaller that a 1 MB block size limit was in 2010 when it was, introduced in Bitcoin, if we adjust for Nielsen's Law of Internet Bandwidth, https://www.nngroup.com/articles/law-of-bandwidth/.

My guess for a miner to come up with 8 solutions, they would have to divide up their hashrate into 8ths - hence effectively reducing their hashrate.  This is bad.

I just did not want to venture into speculations and planned to stop our discussion at this point. But now BCH rulers came out of shadows themselves and made a statement: https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/esebco/infrastructure_funding_plan_for_bitcoin_cash_by/

If a cartel of certain companies and individuals decides which blocks are to be orphaned, then they don't even need any other miners participating for the network to function. And because decisions are done by the cartel anyway, mining is just a waste of electricity. So some further optimizations can be implemented later, such as relocating almost all of their hashrate to mine BTC for profit and evolving BCH security into something like *""we have the authority to generate BCH blocks and claim block rewards because we can always move our hashrate back and prove that we are still the bosses here""*.

HK is a politically unstable jurisdiction. It is asking for trouble. Why not Iran while we are at it?

"You left out at least one very important reservation which has been mentioned numerous times.

There is the claim that this proposal is no problem with > 50% and that's how Bitcoin works. And maybe that would be technically acceptable if the consortium have the hash.

But the 4-5 miners in question don't seem to have those 50% of total SHA256. People have put numbers in other threads. None of these numbers have been > 50% of total. What I've seen has been more around 30%.

The question then is how is the activation of this supposed to go smoothly?

What is the required percentage of total for safe activation and further execution, to avoid e.g. the serious scenario that Mark B. Lundeberg raised:

https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/esebco/infrastructure_funding_plan_for_bitcoin_cash_by/ffapqej/

So far I don't see it addressed with a solution by anyone from the proposers or from any development team (not that I think they easily could - it's about hashrate).

One the one hand this is about unaddressed risks of chain forks due to hostile actions during activation or later.

On the other it is about currency split risks due to predictable disagreement with how this is being rolled out, and due to potentially disagreeable disbanding of the cartel at a later stage.

"No.. not like... exactly.

I am kind of on the fence on whether I can support this plan, but I am also aware that I don't get a say in the plan.

Some/Many (difficult to gauge the truthfulness of this) of us have consistently made statements that the miners are, ultimately, in control of what happens. Now that they are actively taking control and making decisions it's just a matter of us stepping up or shutting up.

BUt.. as much as I respect /u/deadalnix (and contrary to some of my comments, I do respect him to some extent), I do not think he, a developer, should control any funds other than the funds provided to the project he works on. I would say the same thing about /u/peter__r (just using you as an example Peter) or anyone else on the BU team. Since the funds going into the funds belong to the miner, or at least those pools that are enforcing this rule, then they should have final say. I do have an issue, and I am aware that some amount of sinophobia likely effects my thinking, with the controller of the fund being a Chinese based company.

The miners obviously want to spend 6 million USD on BCH infrastructure. But they couldn't resist the temptation to simultaneously do an unacceptable power grab that will destroy BCH in the medium to long term. Human greed has destroyed the Bitcoin invention and its currency variants. You people just don't see it yet. 

The Bitcoin invention is eleven years old now and what has the Bitcoin community accomplished? Constant political conflicts and short sighted greedy egotistical disagreements, hostile takeovers and power grabs, stagnating user adoption and market cap growth to irrelevantly small sizes. The central bankers must be observing us and laughing their asses off. They don't need to destroy us when we keep destroying ourselves. 

I really should stop commenting now because what's the point. It's a bad and futile habit to try to correct people on the internet who will never change their opinions anyway. Your personal greed is blinding you people from the big picture and how great things could be for us all if people would be just slightly less greedy and short term egotistical.

We may whine that it takes so few miners to make a majority decision in BCH (and BTC for the matter), but this has been the case for years. Yet for the whole lifetime of BCH, miners have proven that they have the best interests of BCH at heart.

It also makes a sense from a game theory POV. On the BTC chain, the Lightning Network, if successful, would severely cap the role and earnings of miners. Not so in BCH. If the chain is a massive success, miners stand to benefit directly from it.

Bitcoin itself was developed without millions in funding (as far as we know). The system already works pretty well with decent scaling that isn't even close to being utilized. Sure there are always more improvements and optimizations to work on. But $6 million worth? I don't know man. How many extra developers are going to be hired with that? Or are the existing teams just lining their own pockets big time, while doing mostly the same shit they were already doing anyway? Not to mention the questions of control and who decides how the money is spent and to who.

"I have minor disagreements with some of his points, but they're not worth covering. The one relevant point, though, is control over funding address. I'm fine with the proposal setting up a corporation, because that was just proven to work with the Bitcoin.com dev fundraiser. However, I'm not against entertaining an alternative, just as simple, and which may be an improvement. 

First, on the issue of fund distribution I feel the best way to handle that is using the most recent fundraiser as a template. For those unaware projects were broken out separately where, for example, someone could donate only to BitcoinABC, or BCHD etc. There was also a ""general dev fund"". In this way we saw an effective vote from the whole ecosystem for what infrastructure should get what. Since not much has changed since that fundraiser we can reuse the awarded percentages applied proportionally to the $6M; a sort of *amplified* extension.

Next, I do think it's a good, probably better, idea to make the funding address an m of n multi-sig address. We just need some odd number, like 3 or 5 (to ensure no deadlocks) where the majority can move funds. The names he proposes don't work well because they're all obviously pro BitcoinABC. I like JF as a signer definitely. I'd add Roger Ver, then probably Chris Pacia, Jihan Wu would be great, and then maybe Amaury and Andrew Stone, plus Jiang Zhuo'er.

"No one should be surprised by this. BCH was 51% attacked back in May, and the Bitcoin ABC team almost all abruptly quit back in May due to lack of funding before - guess who! - Roger Ver stepped in and provided funds. You think Roger wants he and his businesses to continually be the sole provider of funding for Bitcoin ABC? Nope. He knows keeping them funded is vital to BCH though so he has/had no choice.

So, I can almost guarantee this is a plot hatched by Roger Ver to save himself money while fundamentally changing what BCH is. It's devious but brilliant, and no one here will call him out on it and he knows it. He's changing the protocol to save himself money.

Keep in mind: Roger Ver ONLY acts in his own self interest, and ONLY cares about making money. Everything can be traced back to those two things. He's the shadow leader of BCH and can literally do whatever he wants with the BCH protocol. And, even if people woke up to that reality it wouldn't matter because without Roger, BCH collapses. Not because it can't stand on it's own merits, but because he is almost single-handedly propping up BCH with hash rate and money that otherwise would be non-existent and BCH would be constantly attacked and manipulated, making it basically worthless.

For those curious about the backstory on the Bitcoin ABC team almost quitting that would've effectively ended BCH back in May:

"No one should be surprised by this. BCH was 51% attacked back in May, and the Bitcoin ABC team almost all abruptly quit back in May due to lack of funding before - guess who! - Roger Ver stepped in and provided funds. You think Roger wants he and his businesses to continually be the sole provider of funding for Bitcoin ABC? Nope. He knows keeping them funded is vital to BCH though so he has/had no choice.

So, I can almost guarantee this is a plot hatched by Roger Ver to save himself money while fundamentally changing what BCH is. It's devious but brilliant, and no one here will call him out on it and he knows it. He's changing the protocol to save himself money.

Keep in mind: Roger Ver ONLY acts in his own self interest, and ONLY cares about making money. Everything can be traced back to those two things. He's the shadow leader of BCH and can literally do whatever he wants with the BCH protocol. And, even if people woke up to that reality it wouldn't matter because without Roger, BCH collapses. Not because it can't stand on it's own merits, but because he is almost single-handedly propping up BCH with hash rate and money that otherwise would be non-existent and BCH would be constantly attacked and manipulated, making it basically worthless.

For those curious about the backstory on the Bitcoin ABC team almost quitting that would've effectively ended BCH back in May:

"TLDR

Amaury says that the proposed changes are made by a voluntary cartel working in a cooperative network and as such it is not a tax. This is because no entities are forced to cooperate as seen in state based taxation. No one is entitled to cooperate here. Additionally this cartel is unstable as participants are competitors hence these actions will most likely be temporary otherwise mass defection. Lastly, the fund will be monitored by 3 groups: miners who can veto, the top 3 dedicated devs dictating spending and trusted parties to vet the process/monitor for fair play.

1) Stakeholders bear the cost of issuance in the form of inflation. It is customarily paid to miners to secure the chain.

2) The fund in question is part of the issuance that miners will not be paying for with hashrate.

"I love self funding mechanisms and what every good self funding mechanism needs is a decentralized voting mechanism to determine how these funds get spend.

My recommendation is that we take more time to do this properly & create a voting mechanism for the distribution of these funds.

Specifically we need some sort of ""smart contract"", implemented as a hard fork which will require a super majority of miners for initial approval.

Once approved this ""smart contract"" should distribute funds proportionally directly to addresses according to miner vote over a certain pre-determined amount of blocks.

I will only support a self funding mechanism over BCH if it is accompanied by such a voting mechanism.

The proposal as it stands now should be rejected, to force miners to give their coinbase award to a private company through what is effectively a 51% attack is beyond perverse.

They aren’t currently having a hard time mining — they probably wouldn’t be mining if they were. That was more touching on if/when this goes into effect and less efficient miners are priced out by the drop in revenue. Larger miners still have economies of scale in all aspects of mining though (moving operation to low electric cost areas, better deal on electricity, deal on bulk ASIC/GPU purchases, ability to afford higher end hardware, etc.) so their price her hash is significantly lower than smaller operations.;1;1;False;ccmrt;ffcnr9d;What ever happened to Roger's $200M BCH ecosystem investment fund?

Because it kicks the smaller miners that can't afford a 12.5% decrease in revenue (most miners) off the network, thereby giving these large pools even more control. Even if a miner decides to stay on the network, they're seeing a \*large\* chunk, if not all, of their profit go into the hands of an organization where they don't even have a say in how its spent.

If Jihan Wu insists on using his (and Bitmain's) influence and power to force this unacceptable tax plan to activate and become a part of BCH protocol rules, then BCH will have stagnated just like Blockstream stagnated BTC.

The point I’m making is that’s why the large miners who created this proposal are supporting it.

"> Actually, it's more than that. We can replace miners to another set of miners. 

""We"" can not replace miners if you are talking about the ""economic majority"" that you mentioned earlier. ""We"" can only pick a side (hard fork) after sides have been set and settled by miners.

&#x200B;

> Also, miners are fully dependent on the rest of the network.

Miners are only dependent on the network at the exact moment they sell their coins. Until they do that, they are completely independent, can mine a coin, exchange it between them without the market having anything to say. But I get what you are trying to say, ok.

&#x200B;

> They enforce the rules (unless a pow change happens, which renders them irrelevant) 

They always inforce the rules. If pow changes, they can just switch hardware and still enforce rules. Miners don´t die when pow changes, they just lose the investment they have done and have to do a new investment to still participate.

&#x200B;

But ok ok, I don´t want to continue this cherry picking of your words and formulations longer.

The market can only react, not act. If the market doesn´t like the change the miners are proposing and eventually enforcing, they can react and let the BCH price plummet. But that´s also all the market can do. And if the miners still win and collect 6 Million Dollars in dev funds in six months, the market will react again and let the price raise.";0;0;False;grmpfpff;ffd6t9e;About the proposed Dev fund change from the perspective of a small BCH miner;esswk0;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/esswk0/about_the_proposed_dev_fund_change_from_the/

"**Tyranny of the majority**

The tyranny of the majority (or tyranny of the masses) is an inherent weakness to majority rule in which the majority of an electorate pursues exclusively its own interests at the expense of those in the minority. This results in oppression of minority groups comparable to that of a tyrant or despot, argued John Stuart Mill in his 1859 book On Liberty.The scenarios in which tyranny perception occurs are very specific, involving a sort of distortion of democracy preconditions:



Centralization excess: when the centralized power of a federation make a decision that should be local, breaking with the commitment to the subsidiarity principle. Typical solutions, in this condition, are concurrent majority and  supermajority rules.

Abandonment of rationality: when, as Tocqueville remembered, a decision ""which bases its claim to rule upon numbers, not upon rightness or excellence"".

How do these pools want to verify which independent miners do donate to the dev fund and which don't without a protocol change?

That's one of the main ideological differences between BTC and BCH. If there's an issue on the blockchain (limited block size for example), then the issue needs to be fixed on that blockchain. Simply forking away isn't a solution since whatever caused the issue in the first place (ie. bad governance) will just reoccur on the second chain, and so on. Nothing was done to fix the governance issue during the fork to BCH so it will encounter the same problems that BTC did. If the community response is to simply abandon the project when the going gets rough then what you'll end up with is a never ending chain of abandoned projects, none of which ever get enough traction to succeed long term.

"You are completely missing the point what 'electronic cash' stands for. It has nothing to do with buying a cup of coffee.

""Since we desire privacy, we must ensure that each party to a transaction have knowledge only of that which is directly necessary for that transaction. Since any information can be spoken of, we must ensure that we reveal as little as possible. In most cases personal identity is not salient. When I purchase a magazine at a store and hand cash to the clerk, there is no need to know who I am. When I ask my electronic mail provider to send and receive messages, my provider need not know to whom I am speaking or what I am saying or what others are saying to me; my provider only need know how to get the message there and how much I owe them in fees. When my identity is revealed by the underlying mechanism of the transaction, I have no privacy. I cannot here selectively reveal myself; I must always reveal myself.
Therefore, privacy in an open society requires anonymous transaction systems. Until now, cash has been the primary such system. An anonymous transaction system is not a secret transaction system. An anonymous system empowers individuals to reveal their identity when desired and only when desired; this is the essence of privacy.""

I don't think that anyone implements negative fees yet, even though such theoretical possibility exists. Or do you mean collecting fees for routing 2000+ payments done by others through your node?

> You know how cash works? I want to pay someone $2 for coffee, I hand them $2 in bills and transaction is done in 10 seconds.

You forgot that first you need to get these bills from an ATM before they appear in your wallet. And if you want to skip this part, then for a honest comparison you need to also assume that you have a bitcoin wallet application with funds in LN channel. Scan a QR code, press a button, done.

> Another example of how cash works and how Lightning doesn't work like cash: I can have an empty wallet and receive $10 no issue as cash. With Lighning I cannot accept any money if I don't have at least the same amount.

"You make a lot of good points as well. I thought Mike Hearn's Lighthouse crowdfunding idea could have been very useful for funding ongoing protocol and application development.  I'd even be happy to see specific feature donation addresses added to features in active development on cash.coin.dance/development, for example (paging /u/killerhurdz).

Even donating directly to the donation addresses listed on the websites of node and wallet implementations runs into a lot of the same problems you mention in your post.  The fact is that it's likely a single person or, at best, a small committee who decide how those funds are distributed even though there are a large number of developers that may contribute code to the project.

At the end of the day, I don't want the perfect to be the enemy of the good.  As far as the current proposal goes, I am neutral and don't have a strong opinion in either direction.  Since this project will have no end-user impact and only affects miners in a direct fashion, I do think it is primarily on them to figure out.

"No, I'm not. Why?

My objection is that I don't think that setting a fixed donation amount and then trying to enforce it with hash power is market-friendly. Why 12.5%? What if a miner agrees with the overall initiative, but thinks 5% would be a more appropriate donation level? Tough luck it seems.

Here are some alternative strategies:

* Pool A declares that 12.5% of block rewards it finds will go to dev fund X. Miners who don't think this is a good deal can redirect hash power to pool B. Miners in pool B who want to support dev fund X can direct their hash power to pool A.

* Individual miners (rather than pools) pledge a percentage of rewards to their preferred dev initiatives.

* Traders pledge a percentage of their annual gains towards their preferred dev initiatives.

* I'm not sure whether any dev groups have set up a foundation that would make donations to their efforts tax deductible, but that might be worth pursuing.

* Point-of-Sale apps like Bitcoin Cash Register could add an on-by-default setting that redirects a small portion of each transaction to a dev fund.

* Having a private company manage funds issued at cost to the Bitcoin Cash network is not the best idea. Convenient, yes, but sets the worst precedent imaginable. Also, the political component of this problem is distinct from the quantity managed, so pointing out the magnitude does not help there.
* This has a good chance of becoming the standard funding method. Doing it transparently with smart contracts will create technological and political progress. If they set out with a conventional legal body, it will only get more and more difficult to switch.

"Some things to remember: 

THIS IS THEIR MONEY - They can do whatever they want with it. Just like you can do with yours. Don't like which projects they fund or don't fund? Go fund your own. They have no obligation whatsoever to involve anyone else. If you were contributing financially, you could contribute to the direction of the funds. As it is, people should quit acting as though they deserve a voice that they've done nothing to earn. Talk about entitled. Your voice is as big as your mining pool, this is the system we all signed up for. They are obligated to be as transparent with their money as I am with mine. I'm surprised at the number of people that claim to be libertarian and then want everyone else to follow *their* rules. Believing that you know better than everyone else is Objectivist, not Libertarian. A little more consistency would be appreciated.

THIS IS VOLUNTARY - I know, they're orphaning blocks that don't play along, but these guys don't even rep the majority of the hash. Any one of them decides to quit and the whole thing falls apart. If a even a minority of the current miners decide they don't want to do this any more it'll stop and we'll be right back where we started. If this doesn't work it won't last. If this is a ""power grab"" it's been very poorly thought out on their part. Occam's razor suggests that this is exactly what it looks like.

THIS IS NEEDED - We have no funding mechanism whatsoever. Passing the hat around every three months isn't gonna cut it. You haven't stepped up to anonymously fund BCH development through your own largess and I'm guessing nobody else is going to either. If you don't like how other people are spending their own money, then step up and put some cash down on the projects you care about, or buy a mining farm and let your voice be heard. Otherwise your opinion is as valuable as your nonexistent contributions to the project.

It's really easy to tell other people how to spend their money. And apparently a LOT of people feel like they are will within their rights to do so. I disagree. If the developers think there are too many strings they don't have to accept it.

"The miners are forming a centralized company just like the developers formed the centralized Blockstream company that effectively destroyed (well stagnated) BTC, making it not interesting to own both BTC and now BCH coins. BSV is a joke so what is left? Currently nothing.

"Sadly after reading this AMA, I have more questions than answers. Here are my concerns:

* Some people say it's a tax, some say it's not. In a decentralized system like ours with no government, I see this as a quasi-tax. It boils down to, miners pay or they get fired.  

* This was not discussed in public, at least not well. Many loyal and deeply involved people like myself were completely caught off guard with this. The Medium post sounded like it was decided, but after reading the AMA it seems not all the details have not been ironed out making this appear sloppy at best.

* Why is there a formal and legal company being made to have the ""donations"" funneled to in Hong Kong? Who owns the company? Who will manage the money and how? Who will be on the receiving end of the money, developers, who? Why not just send the funds directly to the developers, this is going against the actual use case of Bitcoin and adding unnecessary third parties that we are just supposed to trust and hope they do the right thing?

* If the miners who don't comply with the change move to BTC or BSV, these BCH miners will be paying the whole donation themselves anyways. In addition, it weakens our security (hashrate). Worse yet, it increases the level of centralization on the BCH chain. 

* Not to mention the optics here, this is creating yet another rift in the community that will for sure drive away some people to other chains or maybe even out of crypto because people are just fed up of the drama.

* This is between the miners, should I even care what they are doing? Well, sure, we are all part of this network and we should care if the miners are doing something that impacts us. Less security and more centralization are red flags to me. 

* It's still unclear how this will even be implemented? Soft fork, hard fork, no protocol change at all? What? Why wasn't there some draft code at least presented with this so we have a better idea of how this will be activated and deactivated? 

* It's supposed to end after 6 months, do we really have to be forced to trust these parties to keep their word on this?

This is a death sentence for BCH. I fear the damage is already done by simply implying this CAN be done, even if it ends up not being done. These arguments are provably true if this is able to be done unilaterally as being suggested:

- BCH is centralized (Development and funding)
- BCH does not follow the whitepaper (Dev subsidy never in scope/spec)
- BCH is making consensus changes unilaterally, undermining the very fundamentls of Bitcoin's consensus model. (Deviation from Bitcoin consensus model)

I've never been a staunch BCH supporter (I simply want the most coherent scaling plan on-chain), but I did believe the ""use it as cash"" use case was the best one to pursue, and would pay off in the long run.

"> The worst part of this proposal is the existance of a company holding the money.

What the hell? No that is NOT the worst part of this.

The worst part is that this is PROOF that BCH is a CENTRALIZED entity and that consensus changes can and will be made without community input, at the discretion of the centralized authorities dictating what scaling, protocol and functionality will look like going forward.

The worst part of this is that these arguments are unable to be refuted:

BCH does not follow Bitcoin's consensus model nor does it even pretend to.

BCH is centralized and decision making for the direction of BCH is in the hands of a select few elites. Community input is simply not needed, not considered, and will not change outcomes.

Per Jiang in this thread:
> Miners will donate for dev and this will not change.

Centralized. The end.

Not to mention how far this deviates from the whitepaper that it can't even be considered a potential heir anymore.


IMO the worst part of this is that even if they try to walk all of this nonsense back, the implication that it could have been done with such authority unilaterally shows what a centralized whitepaper ditching deviant BCH has become.";0;1;False;pointedpointything;ffco3gh;"AMA: Jiang Zhuo'er, author of ""Infrastructure Funding Plan for Bitcoin Cash""";esoi5s;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/esoi5s/ama_jiang_zhuoer_author_of_infrastructure_funding/

"Which will be never. This will essentially be a regulatory capture by the 4 main pools. These pool owners will of course get their share of the tax but smaller independent pools won't. Thus the smaller pools will essentially subsidize the 4 large ones. So smaller pools will die and the 4 large pools will divide the bch ecosystem between them. 

But why stop there? If you only have to secretly agree between 4 pool leaders when you want to change the protocol instead of open discussion amongst the general public it's a lot easier to push changes through that might not be in the users interest, exactly.

"Well, my voice is but one in a crowd, but I think this is the final death knell for BCH. I've been with it since 2011, watching the goal of censorship resistant digital cash flourish and wither in real time. I was an XT node operator before the fork. I converted to BCH at the first opportunity and I've put hundreds of hours into developing crypto-related application solutions that have, time and time again, been rendered irrelevant, unuseful, or impossible by decisions made on the part of people developing cryptocurrencies. What was once a field of opportunity and potential is now a field of technically hobbled half-baked blockchains that are incapable of supporting applications at scale - even the most basic ones that would exploit cryptocurrency's most fundamental use as a medium of exchange are becoming little more than ponzi schemes.

If dev teams are so starved for money then why are they contributing their valuable time to a project that never had any promise of payment? I'm calling hard bullshit. Devs in the open-source community have always contributed their effort with the expectation that the reward for the work is the general ability to use the software, not a future payment by the software's future users. If the software has a built-in mechanism to fund its developers, the devs are not in it to produce software that is useful, they're in it to make money. I have one word for you: crippleware. There's a reason open-source apps are typically as good as, if not better than, their commercial competitors.

Make no mistake: this isn't a tax. This isn't a tax because it's voluntary; you don't have to pay it. You have the alternative option to not use BCH, and that is the most appealing option to me after this announcement. If BCH is destined to be crippleware just like BTC is, then I'm out. Hard nope, I'm gone, goodbye bitcoin-the-technology and I'm sorry you got fucked so hard by so many assholes, I'm out.

So now I have a channel that may or may not be able to route payments, requires technical knowledge that is higher than rebooting a computer, could be closed at any time or be stuck for weeks if my peer stops cooperating. All that to potentially save 3%? Nobody sees this and thinks this is the greatest idea ever.

They certainly can.  What I'm really saying is that as tx fees increase, it incentivizes more efficient use of the blockchain.  Right now, many txs are extremely inefficient, using up lots of bytes to move very little value, or to only transact between 2 parties.

Using tools like multiple outputs (batch send), signature aggregation (especially combined with coinjoin), and Lightning network channels simply give the world the much more efficient ways of transacting.

Your blockchain will always be filled with bloated 1 input/2 output txs.  Every byte is not created equal.

What's the point of closing a channel when you can just swap Bitcoin on Lightning for Bitcoin on-chain via a [trustless submarine swap](https://blockonomi.com/submarine-swaps/)?  What's the purpose of closing a channel?

> Or maybe you're planning on living in the land of rainbows and unicorns where channels are never closed?

Under normal circumstances, I can't envision a reason to close a channel.

If you're using Lightning as a hot wallet to make small payments from time to time, your channel never needs to be closed.  There is no upside to closing it.  Just keep it there, and use it to make payments when needed.  Even if you run out of funds, there's no benefit to closing it.  If your counterparty wants to close it, let him take on the cost.

If you're using Lightning for receiving income from a business, and routinely want to cash out into cold storage, you still wouldn't want to close your channels.  You'd want to do a submarine swap.

I envision channel closings only really happening when your counterparty is unresponsive.  And in that scenario, yes you wil pay the fee for closing.  However if you did thousands of txs in that channel, and only pay $40 to close it, your fee per tx is less than a tenth of a penny each.  That's cheaper than BCH.

"Hi.  I like your enthusiasm and as a fellow developer respect your knowledge and expertise and I learn a lot from your comments.  

However, I'd have to disagree with you on this issue.  I worked as Software Developer for 13 years and for 11 years was paid sub-standard wages.  I was idealistic and I enjoyed solving problems and coding and creating solutions and new technologies (see my site www.2logcoin.com).  I worked countless unpaid hours from home and after my regular shift ended.  Giving, giving, giving, working myself to the bone for peanuts.  And I live in one of the most expensive cities in the world (Vancouver, BC).  I want to start family, have a house but that's unrealistic - I had a hard time supporting myself for what I was paid.  I think the employer took advantage of my giving and took advantage of my idealism and kept playing with me like a toy - one day he wants one implementation, then changes his mind wants another, then wants a new iOS and Android app by the end of the day because it's urgent.  Then at the end of the days it's actually not urgent anymore and, in fact, didn't need to be implemented at all and why was I working on that implementation in the first place when he told me to work on another thing anyway?  Yeah I got a raise for last 2 years but this shit just got worse and what I was paid wasn't that much anyways.

My point is that regardless idealism and passion for their work, Developers need to be paid decent wages also.  It's a sign of appreciation and respect for their profession so they can be better encouraged to innovate and build new solutions.  You don't tell a doctor: hey, you are an idealist and have passion for your work so why don't you work for free, you love what you do so why don't you work for free?  Why are Software Developers any different?

So I think the 12.5% mandatory tax is actually a good one.  I hold BCH and I want it to grow in price.

"[Pourenelle's Iron Law of Bureaucracy](https://www.jerrypournelle.com/reports/jerryp/iron.html) is particularly relevant here.

-----------------

""Pournelle's Iron Law of Bureaucracy states that in any bureaucratic organization there will be two kinds of people"":
First, there will be those who are devoted to the goals of the organization. Examples are dedicated classroom teachers in an educational bureaucracy, many of the engineers and launch technicians and scientists at NASA, even some agricultural scientists and advisors in the former Soviet Union collective farming administration.

Secondly, there will be those dedicated to the organization itself. Examples are many of the administrators in the education system, many professors of education, many teachers union officials, much of the NASA headquarters staff, etc.

The Iron Law states that in every case the second group will gain and keep control of the organization. It will write the rules, and control promotions within the organization.

"> a few individuals, who are submitting ""high btc fees"" posts on almost a daily basis

Bitcoin Greg is **supposed** to have high fees; that was the very goal of the Blockstream roadmap, the root cause of the block size war, and the main justification for the Lightning Network project. 

And they did achieve that goal in 2016-2017.  The low incoming traffic (and therefore low fees) since 2018 is an embarrassing failure for them; they must be hoping that traffic rises again so the fees go up again.

Those posts are simply referring to what Blockstream wants BTC to be, even if it is not like that now.

> suspecting conspiracy

A ""conspiracy"" is a **secret** agreement between two or more people. Everything in my account above is a well-known fact.  There is no ""suspicion"".

> I suggest you to have this ""fee market"" discussion with /u/nullc

I did already. 

> Have you ever considered the possibility that there was a huge inflow of ""get rich fast"" folks in 2017? 

That may have been the reason why they kept using BTC in spite of the high fees, yes.

"> It is literally talking about merchant adoption.

It is literally saying ""Bitcoin BTC and Lightning Network has died in Australia."", with a dot ending the sentence here. This isn't about retail at this point. The end of the next sentence shorty mention a retail report. And the previous threads from OP and his buddy where-is-satoshi (or whatever his name is) weren't any better. Same deceptive titles on purpose.

> Internet adoption is not attached to location.

Who cares except this guy selling PoS hardware really. Bitcoin is not limited to this, adoption is not limited to this, and yet he arbitrarily cherrypicks transactions to build a narrative and then use it to present it as if it meant something about adoption in general, it does not. As you said ""The End"".

> Well $500Million in three months is not bad isn’t it?

> Certainly not a dead chain in my book.

Go back to the actual point I've made, it's not about BCH being dead (which in comparison to Bitcoin could be argued, unless you intend to cherry-pick data like OP of course), it's about the ease of manipulating this metric.

> Schnonreider BCH, in the same time Manipulated and not Manipulated.

It's Schrödinger, and the point isn't if it is or not as it is very hard to prove, the point is that it can be manipulated more easily. Thanks for acknowledging that it is by agreeing with all the premises that make it possible to do it more easily on BCH.

> I have never seen a place accepting LN.

> And BTC onchain tx are really a poor job for Point of Sell use.

I don't care about your anecdotal experience. all the TravelByBit PoS accept both Bitcoin and Bitcoin on LN for example. Just like many other PoS around the world.

> You seem very defensive about it but that’s the reality.

I'm answering the concern that they are actually ""dead"". They are not. It isn't ""defensive"", it's establishing the truth after OP lied about it.

> And you argued back by cherry picking data, don’t you see the irony?

It's a complete data set of transactions over a certain period of time, no filter... stop pretending it's cherry-picking. If you pretend that I am cherry-picking here, how can you even defend OP's analysis, it's an even smaller/arbitrarily filtered dataset. You make no sense and I think you're actually arguing in bad faith now.

> To be honest, why do you care so much?

I'm doubting your ""honesty"". But I don't like people lying for marketing purposes. Does it bother your plan of lying to people about adoption? Really sorry that you can't just do that without people protesting. As long as you guys will lie about it there will be people pointing it out, it's Internet, get used to it.

> BTC is supposed to be a store of value,

It is, and it works a means of exchange everywhere too, including retail businesses. No amount of cherry-picking from OP or you supporting his dishonesty will change this.

> Why do you support BTC is you disagree with that?
