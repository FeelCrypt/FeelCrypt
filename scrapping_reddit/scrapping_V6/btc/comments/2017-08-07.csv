"I don't agree,  Litecoin is not the answer because it has segwit also.  segwit could in fact be a fatal flaw.   We won't know for some time, but if the corporations and these developers who keep trying to make things over complex get their way they will turn Bitcoin into a Rub Goldberg machine.  

Bitcoin works that way it is, we just need bigger blocks.  

Bitcoin cash is better than litecoin for the reason of distribution.  

Satoshi owns bitcoin cash, like it or not.  

Every bitcoin holder, every old school investor and supporter owns bitcoin cash,  for that reason bitcoin cash is an already deployed Plan B.  

So if Segwit is a poison pill, or if they make bitcoin expensive to use it will die.  

Bitcoin cash is already distributed in a fair way and ready to become the whole network as soon as that is needed. 

You think the bitcoin cash fork was politically messy?  just wait for the next fork of bitcoin when they don't implement the 2x part of segwit 2x.    We will look back to the bitcoin cash fork as the fast easy politically correct fork.  

What is coming up for bitcoin is going to be some major mud slinging and it's going to get personal.

"Censorship is when the state or content controller removes things. Moderation is when someone removes content unfit for the current forum.

">Censorship is a state depriving it's citizen if speech or information.

I respect the fact that you can make your own definitions, but just to be clear this isn't consistent with common usage. As an English speaker, I'm sure you're aware that ""government censorship"" is a collocation. Sequences of words don't become collocations when they're entirely redundant. Imagine saying ""government censorship"" while operating under your definition. It would sound like saying ""wooden tree"".

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Censorship&oldid=793453313) defines the term in this way:

>Censorship is the suppression of speech, public communication, or other information that may be considered objectionable, harmful, sensitive, politically incorrect or inconvenient as determined by governments, media outlets, authorities or other groups or institutions.

A subreddit at the very least falls under the category ""other groups or institutions"". If a moderation policy is such that systematic suppression of certain dissenting opinions is carried out, then I don't see why that wouldn't be considered ""censorship"" by the normal sense of the term, even if we assume that it's not all that big of a deal for the moderators of r/Bitcoin to do what they're doing.

It sound like you're trying to create an argument on lines of morality, legality, and so forth. Sure, a forum is a ""private entity"", which for all of us who subscribe to libertarian views should trigger our minds to the [auto-complete](http://lesswrong.com/lw/k5/cached_thoughts/), ""They can do whatever they want on their own property."" I have no problem with that. And yeah, okay, Reddit as a private company ""explicitly allows for clients to moderate forums according to their own judgment"", which is something we must respect as people uninterested in asking for State interference. But what's your point? That we can't complain about it, call it ""censorship"", say that they're attempting to control the narrative with nefarious means, etc?

>I don't agree with some of the heavy moderation going on but I also fully endorse removing aggressive toxic posts made by angry young men regardless of which ""side"" said asshat is on.

I mostly agree. My only issue is transparency. I'd like to see a forum structured such that the moderators can systematically remove inflammatory or off-topic posts, but where anyone can click a button and be brought to a version of the thread where all the posts are intact. Perhaps one would still be able to converse within that thread, but it wouldn't count for karma, meaning the incentive would be to post in the cleaned-up thread. Trolls and assholes could be kept at bay without running the risk of a few individuals being given the keys to a machine that can drive the narrative in a whole community.";3;0;False;Eric_Wulff;dla5a1n;Just a reminder: /r/bitcoin is moderated by a known scammer named /u/theymos who has bilked the community out of over 6000 bitcoins. /u/theymos approves of censorship and bans anyone he dissagrees with.;6s1zlc;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6s1zlc/just_a_reminder_rbitcoin_is_moderated_by_a_known/

"No it is very very different. The government is the public sector. They make the laws and is a representative of the people. Since the state is so powerful modern civilizations have shackled the state to constitutions, democratic processes and accountability.

A company (or in some ways a forum) is a private entity that operates inside the law. A company is beholden to its owners. Not the employees nor the customers. A company HAS freedom of speech, it does need to GIVE someone else a platform for freedom of speech.

Censorship is a state depriving it's citizen if speech or information. A company removing (by proxy on reddit) someone's post isn't censorship because there is no freedom of speech on a privately owned, non regulated, service.

You are the state, you are not reddit. Reddit explicitly allows for clients to moderate forums according to their own judgement. This is therefore morally and legally just. If you don't like it you can start your own sub in like 3 seconds or just argue here on rbtc.

The difference is merely one of scale. If a government censors your attempt to publish a book, you just got kicked off a book-disseminating platform which has millions upon millions of people who can't or won't go to any other such platform. You could publish in another country, but you've been functionally silenced in a very significant way. However, if a moderator censors you on a forum, it just got a bit more annoying to try to participate within a platform of a comparatively small number of people, many of which are likely to read other platforms anyway. In other words, government censorship is more dangerous simply because it's a much more centralized system where a single decision has a much more significant effect. Reddit and forum culture in general is decentralized to a larger degree, meaning that any one decision is less important.;3;1;False;Eric_Wulff;dla0fym;Just a reminder: /r/bitcoin is moderated by a known scammer named /u/theymos who has bilked the community out of over 6000 bitcoins. /u/theymos approves of censorship and bans anyone he dissagrees with.;6s1zlc;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6s1zlc/just_a_reminder_rbitcoin_is_moderated_by_a_known/

"The post may be true, but the OP's attitude isn't doing himself, anyone else, or rbtc any favors.   People who have never heard of this before who are simply asking for more information are being replied to with profanities and having their intelligence insulted.

There's also the fact that, in his attempt to support Bitcoin Cash, he's blatantly and falsely claiming that the original Bitcoin is the one that's crashing while Bitcoin Cash isn't.   This can easily be disproven by simply searching the price of Bitcoin since the fork (Has gone up from ~$2750 to ~$3250) and the price of Bitcoin Cash since the fork (which has dropped from $360 at the time of the fork to settle at around $260).

I'm not trying to get into the whole debate about which coin is ""better"" or whatever.  But having people who are blatantly insulting others who don't just blindly support your cause, dropping profanities instead of information, and supporting their case with provably false information is not going to do anyone any favors.

IMO, OP should be written off as a troll; even if the information he's providing is factually correct, his handling of the matter has no business in serious discussion of the topic.

"Theymos is doing more damage than good, to the Core team, and the SegWit implementation progress.

A lot of the negative vibe around Core, and SegWit, has been caused by the creation of 2 opposite facing camps. At some point, the effort to keep the community solid, has switched to actively block different views.

So if you really hate SegWit, you should thank Theymos for doing the PR around it. Who knows it might have already be implemented, if the communication, discussion etc around it was more open and friendly.

"I figured out a simpler reason for AXA to push segwit:

> **Reducing UTXO growth**

> The Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) database is maintained by each validating Bitcoin node in order to determine whether new transactions are valid or fraudulent. For efficient operation of the network, this database needs to be very quick to query and modify, and should ideally be able to fit in main memory (RAM), so keeping the database’s size in bytes as small as possible is valuable.

> This becomes more difficult as Bitcoin grows, as each new user must have at least one UTXO entry of their own and will prefer having multiple entries to help improve their privacy and flexibility, or to provide as backing for payment channels or other smart contracts.

> Segwit improves the situation here by making signature data, which does not impact the UTXO set size, cost 75% less than data that does impact the UTXO set size. This is expected to encourage users to favour the use of transactions that minimise impact on the UTXO set in order to minimise fees, and to encourage developers to design smart contracts and new features in a way that will also minimise the impact on the UTXO set.
