"> By corporate you mean 'government' bonds?

Well, meaning their banks are have skin in the game, vs nearly everywhere else, the corporations that buy the bonds exist as foreign entities.


> The difference is thst Japan has accumulated that debt 'slowly' since 91/92 up until 2013.

This is a key difference, thank you for pointing it out. But I do still believe that the amount of debt with relation to the GDP is dependent several factors, so I'll include this in my analysis next time I get around to it. My main point is that right now in the US and Europestan, the banks are foreign with respect to the countries they operate in.

To your last point, the amount of wealth a country can generate for another country is the leading metric to which that countries debt can accumulate. So, the US, having the petrodollar and largest military, is a fairly secure bet for the future. Sweden, only having the the umbrella of the EU is a more risky bet. Financial interests seem to invest where the return on their investment is safer. Greece, having low production and high liability is a considered a risky venture with low possible reward. In other words, the best way for a country to secure loans in the future is to have something to offer as well as more security on those returns than the competition.

If the bank collapse is small and isolated then what happens is the insurer bails out the bank this comes form money the banks contributed to the issuer. If there is a systemic failure in the banking system then the central bank will just print money put of thin air and use that to bail out the bank.

If the bank goes belly up and FDIC isn't enough it's unlikely your taxes bail them out. When '08 happened taxes didn't go to bailing out the banks rather the Fed just printed money out of thin air and used that to bail out the banks. ;1;1;False;PoliticalDissidents;dt8zfil;Shutting down or restricting the uses of bank accounts, thereby forbidding clients to buy crypto, is a blatant affront to the rights of civil liberty, manifested, but not limited to, in the rights to private property and free speech;7su19z;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7su19z/shutting_down_or_restricting_the_uses_of_bank/
"I'm not using the bank to buy crypto, dear god. I'm using the bank services of *transfer* my own money to a crypto exchange. How difficult is to understand that? How can a bank FFS deny me transferring money to, say, coinbase? A fully insured regulated cryptobank? It makes no fucking sense.

"They are very correlated things. If that was so easy we wouldn't need taxes, public services would be paid by a centrally controlled money printer. Why it isn't that way?

Because buying crypto is a choice (behaviour) it is not discrimination being conducted by the banks.  The bank is private property.

"You are thinking about it from the wrong angle. Think about how does a banks, where I'm already a client, denying to transfer my money to a crypto exchange compares to a clothe store selling clothes.

Now, let me extrapolate your argument: do I have the right be be served by at least one clothe business so I don't walk naked on the streets, or freeze to death, etc? Can a business, open to general public, profile costumers so that they don't serve based on nonfactual allegations, or plain prejudice?

I'm not claiming it is an easy topic or ""black or white"" sort of situation, but it seems to me appalling how some americans, who live in a country pride to be free, are indoctrinated to accept the big capital screwing them over just because they are a ""private business"".

"> Look into Japan on how their banks loan directly from the government via buying corporate bonds

By corporate you mean 'government' bonds? If so that's how most countries do it now, but sure japan tends to be a lead example since they are 15 years ahead of the curve.

> They currently have 200% of GDP ad debt (FIAT outstanding) and are functioning quite well. 

The difference is thst Japan has accumulated that debt 'slowly' since 91/92 up until 2013. From 50% to 240%, where every 100% took about ten years. 

Sweden has managed to stay below 70% during the same period with a mean of around 50%. It currently sits at 44% and is declining but, If it were to add 80% to its debt-to-GDP in just 1-3 years it would be like the case of greece, which went from 100% in -08 to 170% in -11.

"Not quite correct.

The opening of the channel is treated like any other Bitcoin transaction - confirmations are required before you can get anything out of it.  You say 'deplete the funds', but the only way you can do that is if someone is foolish enough to consider the channel active without confirmations - which is just as foolish as considering a Bitcoin transaction complete without confirmations.
