hmmm.....maybe banks ARE useful!(in asset distribution and access)...;1;0;False;zaxbyc1A;dyyosyn;1 For whoever questions the utility of Bitcoin, here's banking summarized accurately;8i6ugd;https://i.redd.it/xa71uovqkuw01.jpg
Devil’s advocate, or maybe just a question. I believe in crypto and just invested. I paid 5 fees as i was capped to a daily limit to purchase, then paid fees to move them.  Then my understanding is I paid fees to buy other altcoins (I know this isn’t specific to btc so my apologies).  Will this ever be more inexpensive long-term when it’s better adopted? I know buying actual goods and services is free, but getting btc or other crypto was a challenge and financial drain due to fees ;1;0;False;;dyyous3;1 For whoever questions the utility of Bitcoin, here's banking summarized accurately;8i6ugd;https://i.redd.it/xa71uovqkuw01.jpg
"Check out bitcoin.org and the bitcoin cash websites; they list software implementations of their networks, with Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin ABC respectfully.";1;0;False;Trentw;dyy02t6;"Am I the only one that doesn't mind Bitcoin Cash being called ""Bitcoin Cash"" instead of just ""Bitcoin"" (for now)?";8h7l37;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8h7l37/am_i_the_only_one_that_doesnt_mind_bitcoin_cash/
"The real issue is ""What is bitcoin"". If you believe the core team and the 3 people with commit access who are allowed to choose what code is implemented or not is the one and only bitcoin then r/bitcoin is the place for you! If you accept that there are multiple version of bitcoin and they all have different goals and discussion should be free and open then r/btc (despite its unfortunate ticker name connection) is the place for you. It was clear to me something was rotten the moment I saw that any talk of proposals not approved by the core team was banned. You can tinfoil hat about the motivations. But to me it doesn't really matter. You can not have UN-censorable money if you can not have open discussion about it. I don't know about you, but I did not come here to get rich quick. I came here to help change the world. ";2;1;False;cheaplightning;dyymsld;"Am I the only one that doesn't mind Bitcoin Cash being called ""Bitcoin Cash"" instead of just ""Bitcoin"" (for now)?";8h7l37;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8h7l37/am_i_the_only_one_that_doesnt_mind_bitcoin_cash/
"> But, how can BTC not be the crypto currency Satoshi wanted it to be, if he/they designed it? That’s like a contractor designing a house, building it, and people saying “that’s not the house he wanted, though. Not really.”

Satoshi's house design was a crypto-Currency for the people of the world.  The BTC core developers were replaced/corrupted and they radically changed the design of the ""house"" to only have one doggie-door entrance and a promise to provide a teleportation port next door for getting into the house in the future. The tele port would be owned by a business that would charge tele-fees if it ever got built. They admit they don't want everyone to be able to enter the house through a door because they want their corporate owners to profit from selling teleportation services.

And may end up with r/bitcoin being a forum about Bitcoin Cash. I think things are confusing enough with r/btc, bitcoin.com, and @bitcoin being a Bitcoin Cash forum/website/twitter handle. I used to support r/btc in its more liberal moderation, but the more I see what's happening, the more r/bitcoin's strict moderation makes sense. The two networks are now totally different, with distinct future directions, deservent of their own forums.;1;1;False;Trentw;dyy0j5j;"Am I the only one that doesn't mind Bitcoin Cash being called ""Bitcoin Cash"" instead of just ""Bitcoin"" (for now)?";8h7l37;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8h7l37/am_i_the_only_one_that_doesnt_mind_bitcoin_cash/

"Anyone with their eyes open can see trouble on the horizon for BTC after it simply showed the whole world how broken it is, and how that problem was in no way actually addressed in the past 6 months other than ""Lightning is coming!"" which is simply unacceptable. Bitcoin Cash corrected the problem immediately, and is even correcting it even more tomorrow.

"The founders reward is temporary and lasts 4 years from genesis, after which miners get 100%. Not to say anything about the fairness of this scheme, but it should be noted it doesn't last forever. Zclassic was created as Zcash without the subsidy, though I think this as well as ZenCash and Bitcoin Private are just altcoin fork scams by Rhett Creighton basically.

I always saw Zcash as more of a research project more than a currency you'd really use though . Due to its design and the way zk-snarks was implemented among other concerns it has some fairly serious issues that are not easily remedied to be truly sound money.

You might want to look at Zcoin for the other side of Zcash.
