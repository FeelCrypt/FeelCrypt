"Fear of ""centralization"" is not same as actual risk of ""centralization."" I fear a meteor smashing through my roof.

"The positive aspects versus other non-php technologies are negligible. Prestashop is PHP and it is much better than woocommerce without being super complicated to hack.

My advice is that if you have few products and want something quick that works and more secure than a hosted Wordpress + Plugins you get a static website hosted in S3, then you get your products into something like Shopify or Bigcommerce and link the site so they can reach your shop. You do not need Wordpress at all, and you can stay away from the Apache+PHP+MySQL stack and Wordpress.

That is virtually free for you unless you have thousands of products and earn millions, now, I cannot tell if those support Bitcoin or not, but you could do a plugin yourself I guess.

That way you do not need to maintain it, you can focus on your product and selling and you do not have to be worried everytime Wordpress needs to be updated because your site may break. Or your site being slow because Wordpress is slow, or be restricted by the plugins it can provide which often are not related to ecommerce.

In general it is not a good idea to have your shop and your website together in the same site. Of course, on the short term all will be good but later on is when the issues appear.

"I absolutely agree on all points. For me CounterParty-  and similar metalayers represented (and still does represent) an astonishing advantage, in general, in the context of itself and towards bitcoin. It's logical that should counterparty, or omni become de facto to store assets on THE dominant, battle tested bitcoin chain and users be able to easily transfer them that this is preferential to migrating to another alternate chain even for a bitcoin maximilist that despises any notion of an 'alt'.

 I may be wrong but I think counterparty set the bar high and are possibly the only group who took the proof of burn route to this day?. Which is just one reason why all the hatred towards it seemed a little contrived. 

  I can say that the concept for me was the most fascinating application on 'blockchain' done correctly, fairly and to the benefit of all- not just those involved in the project as was often unfairly implied. I had seen in the wild since the birth of bitcoin itself, again why I never understood the level of obstruction levied against it by some

 I envisaged a lot and i thought that it would only before a matter of time until tokenisation (amongst other things like the concept of a DEX) becomes a word on the tip of everyones tongues. It took some time-  took some bad decisions, lost funds, chain rollbacks and more but it's happening. Albeit at the expense of bitcoin losing dominance and significant dilution that could have been combatted or even largely avoided.

I wholeheartedly agree bitcoin was set back due to the stance some of the core devs, I've spent a lot of time reading and following that. Honestly, fairly shocking behavior and arguably a conflict of interest from a few parties. You summarised it well in the five part post. I'm happy the project is still going along but I truly wish the devs of counterparty had not abandoned it so early and gone total radio silence because I think they could have pushed it forward and kept optimism going. They were the satoshi, the vitalik that was needed IMO but I suppose they had other priorities and had their reasons, I respect the time they did exist.  It's a real shame the project wasn't sitting on piles of money and hype like ethereum it never reached that critical mass point where they could leave and have community takeover. Part of me still wishes they would come back and say the fight isn't over yet, I beleive there could be a renewed optimism. But sometimes you've just got to accept that some things die and somethings flourish. 


I also wish there would be a larger understanding of the history amongst current and future participants because these kind of stories just fade away into the background otherwise and reality becomes distorted. 

I was just thinking what would happen if Luke tried to censor Omni now by abusing his positition to push patches and how *nobody* would stand for it they would be calling for his head now that it's escrowing billions in value and facilitating trades between exchanges. Yet that's exactly what happened in the past !
