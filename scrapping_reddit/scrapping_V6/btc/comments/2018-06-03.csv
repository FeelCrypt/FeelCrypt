"So you don't see a slight problem with the idea of relying on an expansive deficit economy with a shrinking population?

Here let me make it simple for you. Suppose you want to buy a bunch of stuff but you don't have the money to do it. You're in a lucrative business and your salary has gone up every year for as long as you care to remember. So you take on debt which you currently could not service, but you expect that will be no problem in a few years when your salary has gone up. So you spend all the money you went into debt for to buy yourself nice things. But then comes the end of the year, and instead of getting a raise, your salary is cut. Same thing happens next year, and the year after that, and so on.

"Nope. Not at all what I was saying. Nor is that the logic I was using. But this topic is a matter of perspective which is obvious we disagree on. At first there was a single bitcoin. Since that single point beginning there have been and will most likely continue to be forks of the bitcoin project. As such each fork should have its own name to avoid confusion. The value of the forks is not really relevant. But it should be easy to distinguish which fork we are talking about from one another. I do not think you disagree with that. I am not at all advocating that the BTC chain have to change it's name every time a new fork is made. I did not imply that. Once again it seems to me that your measure of what makes bitcoin and my measure of what makes bitcoin are different things. It seems pretty clear to me that you think there is only 1 true real legit official bitcoin and that every thing else is a clone or copy. We will not be able to agree on what is and what is not bitcoin. That is ok. Once again I am not advocating at all to rename it to Bitcoin Core or Bcore or anything along those lines. I think I have been pretty clear about that. I was asking you for a neutral naming convention which you think is unnecessary. To clarify I completely understand that the coin is different from the network and from the implementation.  I am aware that the CORE implementation is indeed different than the Knots implementation. I am aware that Bitcoin Classic and Unlimited XT etc are all different things too.  I am also aware that there are many forks of bitcoin including gold, private, cash, pizza, classhic etc. Though I have to admit I have not looked deeply into any version of bitcoin beyond the BTC and BCH versions so I can not comment on the strengths or weaknesses or validity of them. I could go on listing the things I am aware of but it is a waste of time.   To summarize I think the BTC chain should have a unique name to help differentiate it from the other types of bitcoins that is not offensive or ""misleading"" (Core, Bcore). You think ""Bitcoin"" by itself is fine and offered no suggestion.  I disagree. The end.

I think we are making progress, lets continue. Tell me why you think Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash arent unique names. When I read them on my phone the first name has seven letters contained in one word, and the second name has 11 letters contained in two words. They look unique too me, just like Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Clashic names look unique, they have different and/or extra letters and everything.;1;1;False;Trentw;e01j3z4;"Am I the only one that doesn't mind Bitcoin Cash being called ""Bitcoin Cash"" instead of just ""Bitcoin"" (for now)?";8h7l37;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8h7l37/am_i_the_only_one_that_doesnt_mind_bitcoin_cash/
So as long as the fork markets itself as the original then the original also has to change its name? So Bitcoin becomes Bitcoin Core, then gold forks off and now says it's the real Bitcoin Core, so therefore Bitcoin Core now needs to change its name again?;1;1;False;Trentw;e01k33c;"Am I the only one that doesn't mind Bitcoin Cash being called ""Bitcoin Cash"" instead of just ""Bitcoin"" (for now)?";8h7l37;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8h7l37/am_i_the_only_one_that_doesnt_mind_bitcoin_cash/
But the same argument could be used at any point when a fork occurs. If Bitcoin Clashic said both it self and the original Bitcoin Cash was Bitcoin Cash, and to fix the problem and to stop confusion the original Bitcoin Cash had to change its name. It would now have to call itself, for example, Bitcoin Cash Original.;1;1;False;Trentw;e0273ok;"Am I the only one that doesn't mind Bitcoin Cash being called ""Bitcoin Cash"" instead of just ""Bitcoin"" (for now)?";8h7l37;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8h7l37/am_i_the_only_one_that_doesnt_mind_bitcoin_cash/

No. All bitcoin forks should have a unique name in my opinion. No there is no need for anyone to change their names because as you can see Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Clashic are unique names by themselves. ;1;1;False;cheaplightning;e01idbg;"Am I the only one that doesn't mind Bitcoin Cash being called ""Bitcoin Cash"" instead of just ""Bitcoin"" (for now)?";8h7l37;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8h7l37/am_i_the_only_one_that_doesnt_mind_bitcoin_cash/

In your odd scenario above you are ignoring my main point which is that both BTC and BCH and maybe even BTG  (don't know the details of the fork well and there may have been shenanigans) are all bitcoin.

Also BTC is the ticker symbol for bitcoin (the token) and is not analogous to Bitcoin (the network). So when talking about Bitcoin then BTC does not make sense.

"So Bitcoin should only change its name when forked by Bitcoin Cash? What gives Bitcoin Cash this special privilege over other forks, like Bitcoin Gold?

"Just because something is in your opinion ""the standard"" does not make it untrue. That being said I agree all these naming issues are confusing especially to the uninitiated. The parties in control of all handles/subs will never agree to change so it is a non starter. As to your point about Bitcoin Core being a poor choice for a distinction I also agree it is not the best choice.

So you are saying that every time someone forks Bitcoin it needs to change its name? Bitcoin has been forked many times. Bitcoin Cash is not the only one. Under your logic when Bitcoin Cash forked Bitcoin would first become Bitcoin Core, then Bitcoin Core Gold forks, we rename Bitcoin Core to Bitcoin Core Classic, then when Bitcoin Core Classic Private forks, we rename Bitcoin Core Classic to Bitcoin Core Classic Legacy...

As an example of how other multi version projects do naming, in open source software, the version that forks off takes a new name to differentiate itself from the original. For clarity this makes perfect sense. Open source software projects seem to handle this problem pretty well.

And even if you are going to rename the original, dont add to the confusion even more by giving it the name of a software implementation of the network. To me that shows either ignorance or insidious intent.";1;1;False;Trentw;e01dfh7;"Am I the only one that doesn't mind Bitcoin Cash being called ""Bitcoin Cash"" instead of just ""Bitcoin"" (for now)?";8h7l37;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8h7l37/am_i_the_only_one_that_doesnt_mind_bitcoin_cash/
Fair enough. However if in the future the vast majority of TXs happen on LN would it not then be fair to say that it is the dominant feature and therefore appropriate? When I say Nintendo games you immediately think Super Mario etc when they were producing other kinds of games for about 100 years before.  If the Core team roadmap goes as they plan will not most TXs be on LN?;1;1;False;cheaplightning;e012iy0;"Am I the only one that doesn't mind Bitcoin Cash being called ""Bitcoin Cash"" instead of just ""Bitcoin"" (for now)?";8h7l37;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8h7l37/am_i_the_only_one_that_doesnt_mind_bitcoin_cash/
Depends on lots of things, 1. Other efficiency protocols are on there way for Bitcoin which means more tx per block, 2. Block size increase can still occur with the correct planning, 3. LN software can still make tx without LN. With smart contracts a lot of 2nd layer solutions can be built a top of Bitcoin, not just LN, e.g. have a look at RSK. Calling Bitcoin LN is not thinking broad enough.;1;1;False;Trentw;e0131y6;"Am I the only one that doesn't mind Bitcoin Cash being called ""Bitcoin Cash"" instead of just ""Bitcoin"" (for now)?";8h7l37;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8h7l37/am_i_the_only_one_that_doesnt_mind_bitcoin_cash/
Segwit is only one of many technologies/protocols in Bitcoin. The lightning network is also not Bitcoin, but an implementation of its smart contract features.

*sigh* This as I said before ties directly to my points above. Bitcoin is no longer one thing, but a group of things. It has forked and as such there exists several versions of something where there was but one before.  I assume you will never agree that there is more than one version of bitcoin and you will also not agree on a unique name for the BTC fork of bitcoin perhaps other than BTC. I try to be diplomatic and not refer to things by names people consider inappropriate. But im not seeing a lot of suggestions here.

"Huh? The fact that they take many non-crypto payment methods doesn't at all detract from how ~~huge~~**gigantic** this is, if true. 

""Only"" 7-11, Family Mart, and Lawson? I can't think of any other major chains. I can literally sling a stone to 4 of these from where I am standing (3 Family Marts and a Lawson, further in the distance I see another two Family Marts and a 7-11). This is bleatin' incredible news, and it's much bigger than the equivalent in the US because convenience stores are pervasive, let you pay for almost anything and are a deeply rooted part of people's everyday lives.  

That said, I don't think almost anyone will pay with BCH, since most don't have it anyway and most Japanese don't see crypto as cash even if they hold BCH. You can tell most aren't holding it to use as cash by the fact that it moves in synch with the rest of the market. Unsophisticated investors still rule.

"Standing on the shoulders of your comment to shout how big this is.

Convenience stores in Japan are truly convenient - they provide access to so many services through partnerships with other companies. Not to mention their direct business of food, drinks, etc.

I haven’t seen the details but each of the big convenience stores has national reach and some of them have regional reach.
