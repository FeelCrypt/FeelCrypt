"> When you prevent people from challenging consensus, you lose the democratic nature of the system.

This part literally never happened. Mods have stated hundreds (thousands?) of times that advocating for proposals has always been permitted. This was even true back in the BitcoinXT days when a lot of people got duped into thinking BIP101 was actually a good idea. There was weeks or even months worth of discussion about BIP101, but it ultimately failed to gain anything resembling consensus. BIP101 would have failed regardless of /r/Bitcoin's policy to prohibit promoting clients which were coded to cause a contentious hard fork. 

I think you overestimate the 'democratic nature of the system'. Aside from the fact that Bitcoin isn't a democracy, neither is reddit. Reddit is extremely vulnerable to Sybil attacks as you alluded to previously. Even without moderators, there wouldn't be what you would consider 'free and open discussion' due to rampant manipulation. I maintain that manipulation on reddit has been so insanely high that strict moderation has been necessary to facilitate the free and open discussion that you seek. 

More directly to your point though... /r/Bitcoin is a subreddit about **Bitcoin**. It's not a subreddit about /r/Bitcoin. 

>However, there are serious concerns with the neutrality of moderation on /r/bitcoin which seem targeted at ideas that go 'against the flow'. 

Frankly I think the matter was closed when these guys decided to abandon consensus entirely and create the Bcash altcoin. That token is barely limping along, mainly only because of fraudulent marketing. I really don't see how one can argue that /r/Bitcoin ought to allow attacks on Bitcoin to be carried out by malicious altcoiners. The advocates in this subreddit will continue to weave fabrications (some of which you have repeated) and spew vitriol, and /r/Bitcoin will continue to defend itself as best as it is able. The matter is settled, and Bitcoin is moving forward. ";2;0;False;BashCo;duxic2f;The irony!!!;80doke;https://i.redd.it/8x5ene5qpki01.png

">Given that Bitcoin is a distributed consensus network, I don't think that discouraging manipulators from subverting consensus and damaging Bitcoin's security and network effects qualifies as a 'political agenda'.      

In a distributed concensus system, users must be able to challenge concensus. When you prevent people from challenging consensus, you lose the democratic nature of the system. This may be a side-effect, or the intended effect, but it is certainly effecting /r/bitcoin. Here is what one author says about ""subverting concensus"" in his book, ""Multiversities, ideas and democracy""

>Accusations of censorship are one of the marketing catch phrases that are used to trigger an emotional reaction from people who haven't been in the midst of these dishonest campaigns since they started a few years ago.      

  
I first bought Bitcoin in 2015 and have been reading /r/Bitcoin and bitcointalk since way before then. Many people who have been around /r/bitcoin for long enough do feel that the moderation policies have evolved aggressively into censorship and can give examples of where they see it happening, I really don't feel that it's just a smear attack.       


In some cases you seem to agree. Your own words regarding [BXT]:  
>More accurately, I support consensus. Attempts to moderate BitcoinXT topics based on the lack of consensus has regrettably escalated to censorship.          

.     



>You really should read this: http://lesswrong.com/lw/c1/wellkept_gardens_die_by_pacifism/   

I read the article you linked to, thankyou. It was a good read. I do understand the argument for strict moderation lest the quality of conversation drops, and I can see how /r/bitcoin is possibly the most targeted sub-reddit or even forum anywhere online for those with an agenda, and you guys have a hard job in front of you protecting it. *However*, there are serious concerns with the neutrality of moderation on /r/bitcoin which seem targeted at ideas that go 'against the flow'. Those concerns are lowering the standard of conversation as people choose to raise their ideas/criticisms/questions elsewhere rather than be met with bans, deleted comments, suspensions, and ultimately being silenced. That should be of great concern too, if the moderation policies in place are truely about maintaining quality discussion.    
 As I originally said in the /r/bitcoin thread which this thread is referencing, the one which was removed by /r/bitcoin moderators, allowing at least one corner of the sub-reddit (a sticky thread) to stay a censorship-free place would go a long way to showing good faith in the community. But, as we can see, that suggestion was silenced, and here we are having this discussion on /r/btc instead

I'm not sure that I am. When moderation is done in a way as to push a political agenda, then it is censorship. Moderation is to promote constructive conversation. Censorship is to make sure people only say what you want them to say.    
What I see happening here on/r/btc is less censorship tactics and more manipulative ""psyops"" style operations. Bots and shills, PR groups and disinfo are favored over censorship.

"> As a CS professor, I can say definitively that you're literally wronger than anything anyone has ever been wrong about before.

that is quite a bold statement from a professor. you would think that professors (certainly the ones i work with anyway) would be slightly more reserved with their grand statements. in fact i have very very rarely ever heard an academic state something as truth claiming as that. 

looking at your post history, you don't come across as someone with a professorship either, but let's not judge too much, because there are all sorts in this world. 

> A brute force algorithm is one that must search the entire problem space to find the optimal solution.

as i said, nodes do not need to search the entire problem space as they have information about whole network at any given time. nWe have been over this time and time again, as the routing seems to be a combination of BGP routing (which they call Gossip states) and version of Dijkstra's algorithm. 

Nodes do not have to build a picture of the network every time they attempt to find a rote - as they have one already - so they can immediately discount non navigable routes. 

> The best part about LN is the fact that the network is going to be constantly changing so there's a distinct possibility that even brute-force won't be enough, as the network may change faster than it takes to find the optimal route. That's fucking amazing.

no, it won't - everyone seems to think that changes are always going to happen in detriment to the route finding algorithm. 

in a real world scenario there the dynamism in the network with coalesce around an average. this average will balance neither in favour or detriment to any one search. i.e there is just as much chance that a re balance will work in ones favour, than not.
