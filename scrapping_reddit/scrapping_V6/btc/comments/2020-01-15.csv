"My theory is that Calvin and/or other people (mis)understood the filing as proof that Craig is Satoshi.  Then they concluded  that BSV must be the true bitcoin, and therefore would ""go to the moon"" as soon as the world got that news.  Then they invested a lot of new money into BSV (probably in the form of USDT, and on Bitfinex).

Those traders who sold the BSV to that batch of investors then used the extra USDT to buy other coins. Arbitragers then propagated those gains to other exchanges. 

That would seem to explain why all other coins went up in price, too.

BCH then would have benefited because it is sort of BSV's sister, the ""other"" big-blockian bitcoin.  And BTC would have suffered, because ""Satoshi"" has been saying all along that it was garbage...

"I think the problem may be that ledger does not let you send BSV. So although you will have split, it may be stuck on the ledger.

To get it off, you'll need to access the private key on which it is stored.

"Yes - here's what's happening:

Let's say you have 2BCH and 1BSV in the same address - 1 of each coin is from the same initial transaction and 1BCH is a split coin you received after the fork.

If you create a transaction for 2 coins to go from address A to address B, the coins on the BCH chain will check your balance, see that you have 2 coins to send, and the transactions will go through to the new address.

Meanwhile, the transactions on the BSV side will check your balance, see that there is not enough to send, and the miners will reject the transaction as being invalid. In this case, the BSV stays in the original address.

This results in your entire stash of 1BSV remaining at address A, while your entire stash of 2BCH successfully move to address B. From there, you can transact freely without worry of spending both sides of the split.

Hope that helps you see what's going on under the hood!

You’re both morons.

All the shit coins are so close in value they can swap and do swap places/ranks all the time, especially over longer time frames.

Even Ethereum, the largest shit coin that does have some separation from the pack (of shit coins), its still only \~11 percent of bitcoin. Even being 2nd largest coin with separation, means nothing... Down at 3 percent territory there's no separation at all. ""Coinmarketcap Rank number"" is meaningless in this range.

"So...

There are blockchain forks, and there are software forks.  The former create new coins, and the latter have been around for decades.

Bitcoin Unlimited is a wallet, it was actually originally a software fork of the bitcoin.org wallet from before BCH was around.  They briefly maintained BTC and BCH versions after the BCH fork, but based on their website, bitcoinunlimited.info, it appears that they only maintain the BCH version at this point in time.

There is not now, nor has there ever (intentionally, or for any meaningful period of time) been a Bitcoin Unlimited blockchain fork on the BTC or BCH chains.

(In court, he claimed the public keys and private keys were generated together by an algorithm and would be unlocked by the 8 out of 15 scheme he claims the bonded courier would deliver the last key slice in January.

Craig/Calvin and their shills like Eli Afram have been throwing out phrases like ""keys have arrived"", trying to imply that they now have the private keys, but I'm pretty sure they are just doing that for the pump the last few days.

When the Tulip Trust III doc becomes public, they will point to their December 27th coingeek article and claim, ""we never claimed we had the private keys yet! they are coming Soon™ with the next bonded courier!"" even though it's clear they are doing everything they can to imply that right now.";7;0;False;palacechalice;feh9wom;Is the BSV rally ‘Wright’ or Just Wrong?;ep3i7u;https://thedailychain.com/is-the-bsv-rally-wright-or-just-wrong/

"The problem with HD wallets is like this. I have an Electron Cash wallet that currently has about 2500 transactions. It means that upon start it needs to check if any of 2500 addresses has any money in it. It takes about 5-10 seconds to do that on a 100 MBit connection, during which I see ""synchronizing"" on Electron Cash and it's unresponsive (same will happen on read.cash). 

However, in browser we have even less in terms of synchronization between tabs (in Electron Cash you have only one ""tab""). So, slowness all around.

Currently, we re-sync the balance every 30 seconds. So, if you open 10 tabs - they're basically independent, so we would be creating something like 50 000 balance requests per minute per active user with 10 tabs open. That's a lot of load.. also it would be a very slow UI.

Of course it's possible to optimize that and work around sync issues, but it's definitely not easy and we're not feeling confident enough to implement it. 

So, we're deferring this decision as far as possible, because there are lots of downsides (potentially very slow interface for older users, the older the user - the slower the interface; lots of load for backend services; quite a few ways to get out of sync - before you try to send a transaction - you need to get a list of actual UTXOs - we can't cache it, since you might have upvoted something in the other tab in the meantime or used Electron Cash, which we don't even see - something might even happen during the time when we are getting these 2500 addresses' UTXOs)...

So again, we're deferring this decision as far as possible until we're sure we can deliver something working well.";5;1;False;readcash;fegorrq;Fun with the read.cash wallet mirrored in electron cash;ep2oz4;https://i.redd.it/1ap2qnvi8ya41.png

A reorg was and stays being a reorg, regardless of how you interpret it. Making up new terms for it because it was obviously the most controversial reorg of the past years doesn't make it any better.


>Call it what you want.

No, this exactly not. You might try to do the right thing by writing your articles, but by making up new words like ""repair block"" (probably to avoid controversial discussions about exactly that situation that you describe as ""special"") you disqualify yourself as an unbiased teacher of the fundamentals of Bitcoin.";-1;0;False;grmpfpff;feh6f7e;Executive Hashpower;ep1z8o;https://read.cash/@JavierGonzalez/executive-hashpower-97e56ffb

Let's assume 100% segwit adoption down the line. This would mean a blocksize about 2MB. The graph you showed me wasn't clear if it was block weight or tx size, but let's assume tx size, since this is a worst-case scenario for BTC.

2M/500 = 4000.

We have already demonstrated willingness to pay fees much higher than that.

Also, please note that this is an average. We'll see important transactions - those transfering millions - willingly pay $1000 in fees, because it's still a small percentage and because confirmation speed matters more.

So going back to the thread were in. Who's going to pay $25-$75 per transaction in ideal conditions for a transaction (ignoring the fee bidding wars when Bitcoin is clogged) or who's going to store $5k on LN to make up for high fees? Note you just priced out anyone who uses visa today, which is 99% of the population

Note: the calculations in the thread were based on $0.65 fees, so with $25 fees, expect to need to load up LN with $25k+ to make up for the fees compared to BCH.

It's more likely the the median fee is more where a channel opening fee will be, and even that might be high.

There will be people who pay $1000 to make sure their $1M gets in the next block, and this will bring the average up. And then there will be people who top up channels on payday, with no particular urgency, that can afford for the transaction to wait a day.

"The scaling model was changed 3+ years ago resulting in the fork into BCH so that those of us who prefer the original scaling model.  ie..  increasing the block limit when needed so that it doesn't limit the amount of transactions.  The block limit was originally implemented in order to prevent network attacks of extremely large blocks that would choke up the network.  

The example that was often given at the time in 2010 was a gigabyte block sent by the government or some asshole kid with access to some serious university computers.  

The solution was to create a ceiling of a maximum sized block that would be accepted in order to prevent such an attack while being big enough to handle all expected transactions expected for the next few years with the intention to increase it again down the line if Bitcoin was successful and increased its use enough that it got close to the limit.

There was a concern at the time that future people could be convinced to not increase the block limit when it became time.  Me and most others thought that idea was laughably absurd.  Who could possibly be that dumb? (we said).  If you run up against the block limit it would slow down and maybe even prevent transactions.  How could anyone be convinced that that was a good thing?

"I own both Trezor and Ledger devices, which in addition to the KeepKey, pretty much summarizes the major hardware wallet market. Sure there are a handful of lesser-known wallets, but the three aforementioned companies are what the majority of users use.

"I would choose this strategy: 

Install a Coinomi wallet app. Because it uses the same seed for all coin types. Make a BCH wallet, and a BSV wallet, in the BSV wallet you change the derivation path to the same as the BCH wallet have. The situation is now that you have the same addresses (and keys) for both coins.

Then, with the Trezor, use wallet.trezor.io . Maybe you normally use Electron Cash, you could use that too, but it uses scnhorr signatures by default. You could turn that off, but I think it is safer to use the trezor web wallet. The point with this is to make sure the transactions get replayed on the BSV chain.

Next, spend BCH from the Trezor to the BCH wallet on Coinomi. Now we want transactions that are replayable. You could check the transaction history, because if you have transactions newer than the november 15 2018 BCH/BSV chainsplit, you may have already a split coin there. But you can try, and if not both mover over, go to plan B (which exists).

If this succeeds, you will have the same number of coins in the two wallets in Coinomi. But wait... You are not finished yet: You need to make sure that the next transactions are not replayed. You can do that with some BCH dust. So: Send some clean BCH dust to the Coinomi BCH wallet. Then send all BCH in one go to a new address in the same Coinomi BCH wallet. Complete with send all in the BSV wallet. You have to do BCH first, since you have BCH dust.

This is great. Some places reselling is explicitly forbidden, but tickets should always be resellable. The management could then auction away batches of tickets, aimed at professional ticket agents. This is the same as short selling, which has the effect of ensuring income to the conference. They could choose to sell early, or hope for a higher price after some advertising has been done. For the buyer, it means that you can get in early to have the lowest price, or gamble on cheap tickets the day before if it turns out to be not very popular, and it will ensure there will always be tickets available, maybe for a high price, if you really want it. And you can get rid of your ticket if it turns out you don't need it.

They are two very different technologies and even distinctly different layers of tech.  They are not really comparable in a way you could say one is better than the other.  Unfortunately BCH can't even do a lightning network, which I think is a detriment to BCH's long term prospects, but if BCH wants to scale at the cost of less decentralization, fine with me, to each their own.  I think their approach is a lot more rational than BSV's.;-2;1;False;burnitdownforwhat;fegzw92;Design of Lightning Network;eosrcv;https://i.redd.it/lz804d2cmta41.png
"Not very different based on the whitepaper for the LN. Your right however it's not comparable since the decentralization in today's LN is far more centralized than bch today in anyway. And yes bch can do LN you living under a rock? It's implementable and cheaper to run than btc and it's LN start up costs. And btc is far more centralized given its 1mb blocksize where fees can rack up so big you can buy an entire hard drive to store the blockchain with the amount in fees you pay over a few transactions.

"From point one your case falls apart, it was actually Luke Dashjr that solved how SegWit could actually be implemented/deployed in a way that didn't need a hard-fork, it was just coded by Peter.

Afaik, several people were thinking of going for a small blocksize increase before Luke actually found a way to deploy Segwit without a hardfork. After the way was found, most of those people were ok with going with the TX throughput increase from Segwit.

So you are completely following Ver's script of reverting to r/bitcoin censorship and crap when there are no more arguments.

Talk about actual things not baseless conspiracies, I don't care one bit about either Blockstream or Liquid, I hope they go bankrupt just so people like you will have to see the actual truth and Ver will have to find new even more stupid arguments to dump his bags.

The point is that any self-respecting engineer recognizes that in order to have a hundreds-of-years decentralized currency it has to be in a sustainable form. Any idiot can increase block sizes (see Faketoshi which BCH gave the room to grow even more as the scammer he is today), but you basically kill its future and make it more centralized.

" Vin has a good theory [here](https://twitter.com/vinarmani/status/1217191997724745728)

>The  mechanics of the BSV pump is pretty interesting. I've been watching  this develop for days.  No one but Calvin is mining BSV. Adding more  hash doesn't get him more BSV.  So he deploys hash on BCH a couple weeks  ago (unknown miner with like 60%)  
>  
>He  then takes the BCH and sells it for Tether.  Then waits for some  bullish momentum and starts wash trading BSV/USDT on shady exchanges  which currently account for the volume.  He can put in asks all the way  up to the price he sold the BCH for and lose nothing.  BSV pumps  
As  BSV reaches parity with BCH, he can then dump the USDT and hold the  BSV.  It's actually a pretty genius gambit with essentially no downside.  He can actually use this tactic to keep BSV at basic parity with BCH.   All enabled by the BSV delisting. Very interesting play.  
Keep  in mind that Squire had to cancel the purchase of Calvin's mining  operation so that the Canadian regulators would take the hold off of  their trading. So Calvin's sitting on a bunch of SHA-256 miners  collecting dust.  This play makes perfect sense.

Let's look at a little history (sorry I can't show the charts, you'll have to look for yourself).

[https://fc15.ifca.ai/preproceedings/bitcoin/paper\_8.pdf](https://fc15.ifca.ai/preproceedings/bitcoin/paper_8.pdf)

&#x200B;

Starting in **January 2011, almost no transaction pays a fee**. In the following months, a growing share of transactions started to include a **fee of 0.01 BTC**. The first notable change occurs after June 2011. **Transactions with a fee of 0.0005 BTC appear and account for about 20–30 % of all transactions**. In the second quarter of **2012, the share of zero-fee transactions drops significantly and 60–70 % of all transactions pay a fee of 0.0005 BTC**. In the fourth quarter of 2012, this dominant share registers a sharp decrease, with a **fee of 0.001 BTC now accounting for 30–40 % of all transactions**.

In **May 2013, the nominal value of 0.001 BTC** makes space for a tenth: 0.0001 BTC. This fee level stays on and gains a share of **more than 70 %** towards the end of the sample. The second largest nominal fee paid at the time of writing is 0.0002 BTC. This value started to appear in late 2013 and has a share of 15–20 %.

It is very evident from Figure 3 that the conventions on transaction fees are not static, but exhibit distinct trends over time.

In order to reason about these changes, we map important events in the Bitcoin ecosystem to the timeline (cf. Figure 3). Generally, there seem to be two main reasons for shifts in trends: changes to the Bitcoin reference implementation and actions by large intermediaries in the ecosystem. 

The **emergence of 0.0005 BTC fees in June 2011** can be mapped to the release of version 0.3.23 of the Bitcoin Core client, which **reduced the default transaction fee from 0.01 BTC to 0.0005 BTC**. The rise of transactions with a 0.0005 BTC fee in the second quarter of 2012 is probably due to the launch of the gambling website SatoshiDice. This service works as follows. A user can send a hand-picked amount of bitcoin to an address controlled by SatoshiDice. The service owns several deposit addresses with different associated win and payout ratios. For every incoming transaction, SatoshiDice instantly creates a new transaction to the incoming transaction’s source address. This new transaction returns the prize to the user in case he is lucky, or a very small output value to signal a loss.

After its announcement on 24 April 2012, the service quickly gained popularity.

It started to flood the block chain with transactions, leading to allegations of being a “DDoS attack against the Bitcoin network” 

While we could not find a plausible reason for the drop of the 0.0005 BTC nominal fee in early 2013, we found a possible explanation when looking at the payout transactions of SatoshiDice before and after this shift. Prior to it, **SatoshiDice added a transaction fee of 0.0005 BTC to each payment. Then, in the fourth quarter of 2012, it doubled the fee to 0.001 BTC**, while **everyone else still payed the Bitcoin client’s default fee of 0.0005 BTC**.

On **29 May 2013, version 0.8.2 of Bitcoin Core, the reference implementation, was released. In this update, the default transaction fee was lowered from 0.0005 BTC per KB to 0.0001 BTC per KB**. Hence, the growing share of 0.0001 BTC fees might also visualize the adoption rate of both the new version of the reference client and other clients following this change.";1;1;False;Crully;fei0a4u;Lightning Theft prevention question;eool3i;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/eool3i/lightning_theft_prevention_question/

"Vin has a good theory [here](https://twitter.com/vinarmani/status/1217191997724745728)

 

>The mechanics of the BSV pump is pretty interesting. I've been watching this develop for days.  No one but Calvin is mining BSV. Adding more hash doesn't get him more BSV.  So he deploys hash on BCH a couple weeks ago (unknown miner with like 60%)  
  
>  
>He then takes the BCH and sells it for Tether.  Then waits for some bullish momentum and starts wash trading BSV/USDT on shady exchanges which currently account for the volume.  He can put in asks all the way up to the price he sold the BCH for and lose nothing.  BSV pumps  
>  
>  
>  
> As BSV reaches parity with BCH, he can then dump the USDT and hold the BSV.  It's actually a pretty genius gambit with essentially no downside. He can actually use this tactic to keep BSV at basic parity with BCH.  All enabled by the BSV delisting. Very interesting play.   
>  
>  
>  
> Keep in mind that Squire had to cancel the purchase of Calvin's mining operation so that the Canadian regulators would take the hold off of their trading. So Calvin's sitting on a bunch of SHA-256 miners collecting dust.  This play makes perfect sense.

"Again you don’t seem to grasp what ‘currency ‘means. BTC ‘maxing out’ is also not really descriptive of reality. Blocks can be full and you could still end up in the next block with 1 or 2 sat/b. It’s all about time preference. I know you probably make sense in your own mind, but it would help if you could use the right words when you talk to other people.

But anyway, the important metric is more fundamental than fees, it’s about what Satoshi wrote in the Genesis block, the headline about the bailout of banks.

To preserve the fact that Bitcoin is a real hard money and truely decentralized, you can’t allow the situation where you rely on miners staying honest and stop users from validating the rules and their incoming transactions.

You totally ignored that until now that BSV goes a step further than BCH. Now it’s all about subtlety and dev controlling the network apparently. Who says how big thw blocks can ve to preserce decentralization and also stay ‘usable’ (I don’t agree with that word here, but for the sake of argument I will indulge you). 

I don’t care much about price either, but it is the only objective metric we have in measuring usage/adoption. People are willing to pay x amount for 1 bitcoin and it is about 30 times more than they are willing to pay for 1 BCH.

You can think the market is stupid, but it is merely a reflection about what the world thinks.

And be honest, Bitcoin first did 8 years of the work to build the brand alone and so BCH had a head start like any other altcoin or fork out there. Crypto didn’t exist before Bitcoin, so 2,5 years now is not that short to be honest.
BSV is much younger and is now on par with BCH.

And I’m afraid you heavily underestimate the industry that is build around Bitcoin and the development happening there. There are many companies building on Bitcoin and probably about a dozen big podcasts devoted to Bitcoin alone, with most of them pumping out 1 or more episodes a week.

Further more the volatility of any coin makes it impossible to be a good medium of exchange or unit of account. So how is BCH.a good currency? (again, not the correct term here, but using your words).

But let’s end this discussion now, we won’t convince each other anyway. Which is fine. 

You can have the last word if you want, but I won’t reply anymore.

BTC is maxed out, fee are minimal today even a moderate increase of tx demand will bring back to Nov17 price.

BTC is useless as a currency if it have no capacity available.

>	And I see now it’s ‘compromise’ that makes BCH the most valuable chain to you. After the BCH fork it was being exactly what was written in ‘muh whitepaper’ what was important.



Increase capacity/ block limit made as a config parameter, so network capacity is under dev control,

Protocol onchain optimization: CTOR, schnorr, graphene (95% compression on block propagation), etc..

Usefulness: CDS (allowing trustless escrow, unique to BCH), OP-code re-activated, new op-code, dividend token one-click easy, etc..

Privacy improvement: cashfusion/cashshuffle dead easy and dead cheap.

Bitcoin as BCH is disruptive again and not like the an high friction/high cost for offchain/side chain solutions BTC dev are trying to build.

I do see the ridicule of BTC and BSV, but BCH is building thing and making progress.

>You all got what you were hoping for, but you only start to realize now you were wrong all along. That’s the beauty of it.

Then yes we lost.

Now when it comes to protocol improvement and usefulness, the BCH progress has been far beyond expectation.

There is thing possible on BCH that are impossible on any other crypto.

So if you look beyond price for a second you might see something different.

Lol. Craig explains that hash becomes a sawtooth function when the subsidy gets replaced with fees. This is because once a block is found, miners will turn off their hardware because the block reward resets to zero. Then when transactions pile in, miners turn on more machines as reward gets bigger.  This function will cause blocks to be mined closer and closer to 10 min. Seems pretty clear and straightforward.

I agree there is risk to increase block size but there are also risk to keep the chain crippled.

To me BSV and BTC vision are equaly dangerous. 

Both are unsustainable. One chain doesn’t give a shit for usage (and actually strongly fight it) and the other don’t give a shit for decentralization..

In that case Peter R. Rizen was correct. Back-to-back blocks happen at a relatively predictable rate.

The reason is that bitcoin mining is designed to be ""progress free"". That means that the next block is *always* expected within about 10 minutes: regardless of how recent the previous block was.

"Hi. I split my coins a while ago and I wanted to share my experience as it took me a while to figure it out. I hope I remember correctly.

1. One way to do this is by sending your BCH to a service that can split your coins, such as Edge wallet. Send BCH you want to split to Edge wallet, from the menu icon next to your BCH wallet in Edge wallet, select ""Split Bitcoin SV"". It will extract the BSV. [https://edge.app/blog/how-to-claim-your-bsv-with-replay-protection/](https://edge.app/blog/how-to-claim-your-bsv-with-replay-protection/)
2. Another way to extract BSV is to take the seed of your wallets and put it in Electrum SV. You should see your BSV there.Above seems simple, but the tricky part is, if you have any mixed coins in your wallet (including the dust that you receive, so you might not even realize you have mixed coins), your BSV stays in your original wallets without being sent with BCH whenever you sent it. So your BSV could be stuck in some of your wallets and not just the one you are using right now, even if your wallets are not showing the amounts.

I am not an expert or even good with tech, so please do your own research too, but this was my experience. I hope this helps!";4;2;False;akaneyokoo;feflzgz;BSV now worth more than BCH?? whats going on?;eon5mm;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/eon5mm/bsv_now_worth_more_than_bch_whats_going_on/

We are 100% on the same page in concluding that the scenario you described for LN will never attain global adoption.

I don't think hypothetically assuming people would accept insane fees, along with global adoption of a dystopian LN and what the resulting game theoretical consequences for custody of funds turn out to be, is a debate worth pursuing further.

I get the semi-custodial interpretation as jessquit described it

>What absolutely *can't*  work is a tiny number of individually-cheap on-chain transactions (with  a much, much greater number of transactions being handled by the LN).

You are right. But the thing is... you haven't unearthed some clandestine plot. Or some paradox that is causing BTC/LN supporters to suffer cognitive dissonance. Everyone is aware of the issue at hand because it is basic.

Everyone is aware that LN will require a higher transaction capacity at some point. That source routing won't work with millions of nodes. Nevertheless, the BTC community has decided to export the low value transaction use-case to LN. This decision has a lot of trade-offs... network growth, complexity, uncertainty. And like virtually everything in this space it's a gigantic experiment that can fail at any time.

I am however not at all concerned with LN failing. If LN fails to cover the low value transaction use-case, some other coin will step up an do that job. If BTC fails to provide the highest levels of privacy, some other coin will do that. If BTC fails to be the worlds decentralized touring complete computer, some other coin will do that. If BTC fails to achieve 0% volatility vs USD, some other coin will do that.

">I believe that most people currently invested in BTC would not consider anywhere near 33USD to be an acceptable tx fee.

That's nice, but the problem is BTC hasn't done anything meaningful to fix the problem that created those fees.  Borrowing from some other old comments (sorry, I've had these convos too many times before):

In late 2017 we saw what happens when a rightward-shifting demand curve for transactions slams into the vertical line of an increasingly-inadequate supply quota on block space.  The network's performance degraded quickly and severely with $30+ fees and insane confirmation delays. Yes, transaction fees subsequently came down when transactional demand declined, and some of that decline was the natural result of a receding hype cycle.  Unfortunately, some of that decline was due to [demand destruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand_destruction), i.e., some users and use cases abandoning the Bitcoin network because of its terrible user experience, and other users and use cases never adopting it in the first place. Of course, that kind of negative and non-adoption is absolute poison for something that's attempting to become money, a good whose utility is derived almost entirely from its network effect.

And no, SegWit does not constitute a ""meaningful"" capacity increase.  SegWit provides a one-time, slow-motion, and extremely tiny bump in the effective block size limit that's only fully realized as people convert their existing UTXO’s to SegWit UTXOs *and then begin spending from those SegWit UTXOs*.  Even with 100% adoption, you only end up with an effective increase of something like 70-100%. That's nothing for a network that *should* be experiencing continued exponential growth in terms of usage. And, in my view, SegWit's modest benefits are greatly outweighed by its irreversible technical debt (the result of doing what was really a ""hard fork""-style change via a hacky soft fork).

>But I realized that I never expected a payment channel to be anything else. This is literally how LN was explained to me.

Really? Because I've seen a lot of people touting LN as a ""scaling solution"" that enables you to transact cheaply and ""trustlessly.""  

>Everyone is aware of the issue at hand because it is basic.  Everyone is aware that LN will require a higher transaction capacity at some point.

I wish that were true but my conversation history (I've debated these points many, many times over the past few years) tells a different story. I think *most* ""BTC/LN supporters"" probably *do* get that LN will require a higher transaction capacity at some point, i.e., that you won't scale LN to billions of users by building it on top of a network currently capable of handling, at most, about half a *million* tx / day.  (But not all, I've definitely had people argue that BTC's block size should *never* be raised and that the protocol should be ""immutable"" and this is totes fine because BTC should be a ""store of value."")  But in my experience, most *don't* seem to deeply understand, e.g., the three numbered points I raised.

>Nevertheless, the BTC community has decided to export the low value transaction use-case to LN.
>...
>I am however not at all concerned with LN failing. If LN fails to cover the low value transaction use-case, some other coin will step up an do that job.

>Will all this be a loss for BTC? Sure, I guess. Will it be the end of BTC? Somehow I really doubt it.

I do think BTC failing to cover the ""low value transaction use-case"" would (eventually) be the end of it, or at least relegate it to a very diminished status versus whatever coin ends up emerging as money.  The way I see it, Bitcoin's real value proposition was its potential to be the best money the world had ever seen. And the entire purpose of money is to reduce transactional friction.  The best money is thus the one that does this most effectively including: (1) reducing the friction associated with finding a transacting partner (by having a massive network effect, i.e., being very widely--if not essentially universally--held and accepted); (2) reducing the friction associated with making an individual transaction (by being fast, cheap, and reliable to transact); and (3) reducing the friction associated with holding money between transactions (by having a predictable, finite supply).  Bitcoin was revolutionary because it was the first form of money that promised to combine the reliable scarcity of supply (category three) of a gold-like commodity, with the transactability (category two) of a purely-digital medium. In order to ""take over the world,"" it just needed to preserve those two properties while massively expanding its network effect to complete the monetary trifecta.  Unfortunately, in its current configuration, it's now in a position where as it becomes a better money along one essential dimension (thanks to increased adoption / network effect), it simultaneously becomes a worse money along another essential dimension (as rising congestion causes transacting to be increasingly slow, expensive, and unreliable).  

Having said all that, none of it implies that BTC won't still ultimately emerge as the winner.  As I've written before:

People seem to lose sight of the fact that the value of any cryptocurrency today is almost entirely speculative. When you buy BTC or BCH (or Dogecoin or anything else for that matter), what you're *really* buying is an entry on a *ledger*. That ledger is associated with a current protocol (i.e., a set of Schelling points that define how that ledger is updated). But that protocol can change over time. Moreover, (as we've obviously seen on several occasions) a multiplicity of protocols may end up carrying a ledger (as of a particular point) forward. The nature of money is such that you want to hold a piece of the ledger that you think that ""everyone else"" will want to hold in the future (and of course they'll have the same goal). BTC's current protocol might be very sub-par, but the fact remains that it's still the market leader with the largest market cap, the chain with the strongest ""brand,"" the (at-least perceived) ""original"" cryptocurrency, the chain with the most proof-of-work, and the chain with the most infrastructure support. That makes it a VERY strong Schelling point for the market to ultimately converge on (although it will *eventually* have to unfuck its protocol and actually deliver on the promised potential that cryptocurrency offers). BCH on the other hand launched as a rebranded (new ticker, new name), minority hash-rate spinoff that made wallet-breaking changes to its transaction format and difficulty adjustment algorithm. In doing so, it sacrificed a huge chunk of its network effect (reflected not only by its substantially lower price but also by its still rather anemic transaction count). Its network effect took a further hit with the messy BSV split. BCH obviously hopes to rebuild its network effect, but there's no guarantee that effort will be successful and the past two years aren't exactly uniformly encouraging in that respect.

Kind of. You do need something else to pump, could be USDT, USD, or something else. But remember that prices are set at the margin (this means that only the most recent trade is counted). So the whole market cap is reported as if all the token could be sold at the last price, which it clearly cannot (for example, I could easily sell 1 BCH into the market now for $340 but it is unlikely that I could sell 1,000,000 BCH immediately for the same price). So, because the BSV markets and exchanges have what is called ""thin liquidity,"" it is relatively easy to influence the price with smaller sums of money than might be implied by the growing market cap.

"That would be implementation improvements, that is good.

Basically what I have been looking for is things that BSV does that isn't possible on BCH due to some changes in the protocol. Haven't yet found anything.

When going to GB blocks blockchain size and block propagation time will be issues. BCH proposes to use UTXO commitments and CTOR+xthinner alike to lessen that bottleneck. UTXO commitments need protocol change. CTOR is already activated on BCH, so xthinner can be enabled without further protocol changes.

Tell me how it's better that goods are made in countries with little to no care for the well-being of even their own citizens. That includes pollution.

Tell me how it's more prudent to ship millions of tons of goods by land sea and air than to produce them in your own region? Then, when those goods are thrown out, to waste even more fuel to ship the trash back, so it can be burned in a country that doesn't care about air quality.

I mean, do you care about the environment?

Tell me how a company paying your neighbors twice the price to make something instead of paying a slave wage in some third world country just to save 2% when accounting for material costs, overhead, and shipping is detrimental to your community. When your neighbors will be spending their money in your own community also, probably buying from the place you work at.

Labor shouldn't be outsourced until there truly is a shortage of labor. Not this current fudging of statistics to make it look like that's the case. (Been going on since the 80's.)

Globalism is about reducing every country to the same low standard. Real competition drives up the standard. Globalism is basically global socialism. Forced international trade is detrimental to both sides of the deal, the only time it makes sense is if a country has something that you cannot make domestically. Cheap labor to make things that barely last a year, when they used to last a century, is one of the causes of poverty and a major cause of pollution.

There's a reason for the order to the phrase ""reduce, reuse, recycle."" The benefits go beyond just the environment. If we bought things that lasted, we wouldn't have to buy as many things, trash as many things, and we would actually save money, time, and effort for things that benefit us all. Like philanthropy, research, or space travel.
