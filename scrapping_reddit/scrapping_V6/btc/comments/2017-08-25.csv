">I don't see an 8MB block as a tremendous improvement over 1MB blocks, especially if we are expecting mass adoption and continued growth.

mass adoption is what should be happening now.

80% of the market for mass adoption earn less than $10 per day. 

Bitcoin is designed to subsidize transaction costs by almost 100% to facilitate this mass adoption. - this subsidy will only be effective for the next 6-20 years, why squander it. 

Limiting transaction capacity to 1MB is forcing users who volunteer to adopt this new technology to big against each other forcing the cost to transact above the daily wage of the potential market. 

take a $5 investment in 2011 it would result in a $20,000 return today. 

in contrast a $5 investment in BTC is not disposable it's the average cost to transact.

both transactions take up the same space, why prevent $5 investments in bitcoin?

"Well, that was my understanding too, but I've learned a bit from some of these replies - including what ""support"" actually means.

It turns out there are two kinds of ""support for SegWit"". Well, three, including the ""don't care don't upgrade"" path, but that comes with new caveats (later).

The first kind is the ""P2SH Wrapper"" kind and it wraps the witness hash in a dummy P2SH (""3"") address. Non-upgraded nodes see these as ordinary P2SH addresses and can treat them as such with no problems. They afford a marginal byte overhead against their P2PKH (""1"" address"") equivalent, but that is offset by the fee weighting system yielding a small fee savings (byte-for-byte vs. P2PKH).

The second kind is ""true SegWit"" and it's a whole new animal. They start with the actual ANY_CAN_PAY script operation which is now OP_SEGWIT. Old nodes will still view these as technically valid but nonstandard transactions and will be able to process them but not interpret the address, while fully supporting nodes will be able to validate the segregated witness data and decode the address. They take a new address encoding (appears to be another ""cool for cool's sake"" design: ""Bech32"", a special base 32 representation that has some error correction algorithm applied to it) and use a new prefix ""bc1""/""tb1"" that won't validate unless the software is updated to recognize the new Bech32 format. They offer a marginal transaction byte overhead savings against ""wrapped"" addresses because the wrapper is omitted.

Note that I said ""fully supporting"" earlier - this is distinct from ""supporting"". If you support the new ""wrapped"" addresses (and for validating software, this means witness validation), you support SegWit. This means a lot of non-validating services, or ones dependent on Core software validation procedures, were able to do nothing and claim support! However, what is unclear is how widespread ""full support"" is - meaning, the ability to interpret, validate, and process bc1 addresses. A wallet can support SegWit without providing SegWit, and that's a huge distinction that is very easily blurred.";3;0;False;chernobyl169;dm37ltd;"I love how all the trolls battled us when we said ""SW provides no immediate relief"".

"The ""normal"" fee required to move most wallets to Segwit addresses won't be what most people consider normal.  It will be huge.

You are spot on about LN. Siphoning fees off chain just reduces security as there is less profit for miners so they go do something else. I hear that mining equipment can be used for Bitcoin Cash! ;) 

You've also hit the nail on the head with fees, everyone focuses on $value of fees. Long term its about getting satoshi/byte down so it remains usable, at much higher coin valuations. 

This is why fees replace the block reward, because in large blocks, many thousands of tiny satoshi amounts can add up to just a few mBTC by which time BTC value is so high that in dollar terms those mBTC in fees are *very* valuable.";2;0;False;sgbett;dm3pdic;"I love how all the trolls battled us when we said ""SW provides no immediate relief"".
