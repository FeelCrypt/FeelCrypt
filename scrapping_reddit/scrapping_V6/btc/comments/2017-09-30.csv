"I hope no one engages in those tactics and there's no proof Core/Blockstream devs participated in them before (sans smear campaigns).

Todd has said some questionable things though:

>Get in touch with me before you decide to offer a reward or anything for
actually making an attack happen... You have the support of a core dev
FWIW, I'm sure you can guess who. Warren of Litecoin says he believes
you as well, and asks you try the attack on a smaller alt-coin. :P
 
>Strategy would be good here, especially because the same attack(s) can
be used to take down the whole network too, but we more want to show how
SPV specifically is bad. Implementing a darknet to resist network-wide
attack is easily done, and it looks like doing peer prioritization will
help for those for whome darknets aren't a good option. Some testing of
the latter prior to an attack would be good.

"> Did it occur to you that the cost of attack increases with user base?

It does not. Number of non-full node users does not increase the cost of any known attack. It reduces the cost of many attacks, such as trust based attacks compromising the full nodes that large numbers of SPV users rely on. When one computer can be targeted to attack thousands of users, that's an increase in centralization and a degradation of the security of those users.

Again, a very basic technical misunderstanding being played off as subjective politics. This isn't philosophy where anything can be argued as a correct answer, it's network properties. Thankfully bitcoin will succeed whether you understand it, whether you fork it, and whether you politicize the environment. Bitcoin possesses the most unique network property in the world in decentralization and so long as it does it will have value.

Did it occur to you that the cost of attack increases with user base?

A lot more than with full node count, mind you, *as users are incentivized to keep their coins safe!*

As long as he broadcasts the transaction he has done all he can.  If the network can't process it that is not his fault.  If they don't get their coins because the network is crap or attacked then it is their own fault.  Personally, I hope there is only one valid chain post the split - the 2x chain.   But ideally, the 1X chain would hold long enough for all these people to sell off their 2x and move entirely to 1x and then 1x dies with fire.  Really hope Jihan, Mcafee and others tear it down as harshly and ruthlessly as possible - if it was me, I would show absolutely no mercy to these turds - enough is enough - it would be worth spending millions in the short term to purge them because in the long term far more value will be created without them. They have tried to hijack the coin and they have no right to do so - absolutely none - what they have done is simply heinous. Problem with these miners is that they are too nice and soft and too patient - if they believe so strongly that 2x is the right way to go, then make it happen.

You know? I disagree here. When it was first announced, I wasn't at all sold on the idea of Bitcoin Cash, but as things have progressed I've increasingly realised it's the best insurance policy we could ever hope to have. If 2x fails, I'm pretty confident some big players will shift their weight towards it.

And crypto is far from dependent on bitcoin at this point. Ethereum has caught the business world's eye, and Monero will continue being a solid crypto with its feet well grounded on earth. And I said, BCC can more than sufficiently carry on with bitcoin's legacy for the needed uses of a public ledger.

"Let me put it this way:

If I were a small blocker who only visited the other sub, where the news of a shitty Mexican bitcoin startup reneging on the NYA is posted everyday for a week with the title ""the SW2x plan is crumbling to pieces!"", at this point so far off from the fork, I might feel confident that during this time things would continue going that way, and I might be willing to posture by making a ridiculous public bet like this. After all, the BlockStream Boys® have invested far more money into their plan, and they have satellites and shit! And whenever /u/nullc speaks or posts, he doesn't leave any doubts that he's convinced this is a) going to happen, and b) that the silent masses clearly and obviously support him (can't say the same for /u/adam3us, unfortunately, he's just not a good bluffer or particularly savvy with people). This all looks pretty bullish for CoreCoin from that perspective, so betting 250BTC doesn't seem like a bet, but more like a way to get those stupid zealots to give up their BTC in exchange for their ""BCash 2"".

But one week out from the fork? With miner signalling still over 90%, and the large exchanges holding their support? I'd be getting pretty nervous, and I 100% expect they'll all be trying to weasel out of the bet.

I wonder then if they all end up losing 1MM$ each due to being misled by the BlockStreamers, whether they'll perhaps seek reparations from them, once it comes to light just how empty and big a bluff they were engaging in with the community, and misleading everyone with their patently false revisionist views of the incentives mechanisms and governance forces that dictate the functioning of bitcoin? /u/coblee";12;2;False;redlightsaber;dnphl3c;I just bet 1,000 BTC (~$4M USD) that Segwit 2X coin will have more value than Segwit 1x coin.;73az4n;https://twitter.com/rogerkver/status/913870930815807488

If you cannot answer this question yourself, I hope you have not invested any significant amount of your fiat. 

It depends on what you define as Bitcoin (I am not using ""btc: to discuss, neither should you). How do you define Bitcoin? 

If you define Bitcoin as only that chain that is supported by the Blockstream/Core developers, then IMO, yes, it might cease to exist.

If you define Bitcoin as the longest chain of most PoW, then Bitcoin Core might cease to exist, or become a minority chain.

Or, something else entirely.

I suspect that the exchanges then also open themselves up to massive litigation, as the only reasonable definition of Bitcoin that would actually hold up in court is based on mining SHA256 POW.

Core doing an 'emergency POW change' is Core saying that they are somehow special. And if they are special, are they suddenly the issuers of the coin, and thus liable?

They might try and one or two exchanges might flip or posture. But I doubt it will be all, and I think that exchange will be in a world of hurt afterwards.
