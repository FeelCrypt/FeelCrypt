***Yes***. Because market cap doesn't say much about how much money is needed to move the price of an asset - the elasticity of demand and supply say that, and market cap tells you nothing about either.;10;0;False;All_Work_All_Play;dmnbk7l;As 20m more Tether are issued today, I think it's important for people to know that an unbacked Tether could be a big reason for the recent bitcoin price rise.

Santander was teeter on insolvency itself not so long ago, may still be the case. Most stable U.S. banks will not give rates like that unless it is a teaser rate on a CD or something. Certainly not on a savings account.

So there is not cap on how many tethers there can be? If this is the case then we need a 3rd party to ensure that all the tethers are indeed backed up by dollars!;1;0;False;1776Aesthetic;dmmaihm;As 20m more Tether are issued today, I think it's important for people to know that an unbacked Tether could be a big reason for the recent bitcoin price rise.

It's the same old story. A big exchange get's hacked but that it not the end of it, no, it looks like the exchange survived and everybody is happy. But in reality it's the beginning of the end. As long as the exchange has enough incoming funds it can get away with everything. But then more stuff happens, people start loosing faith and start withdrawing their funds, the big players first cause they have good knowledge and intuition or they would not be big players. The exchange tries to do everything possible to stay up and running but eventually it becomes so empty in side that a collapse is imminent. The fact that banks have the power to make it as hard as possible for an exchange to stay alive does not help. Banks are not stupid, a big enough succes with crypto would not be good for a lot of banks. And so there is both bad regulation (the banks) and no regulation (no external audits, internally the exchange can do whatever they want) going on at the same time. As crypto get's more mature this will change but right now we are still in the wild west. ;5;0;False;Kain_niaK;dmm38cl;As 20m more Tether are issued today, I think it's important for people to know that an unbacked Tether could be a big reason for the recent bitcoin price rise.
