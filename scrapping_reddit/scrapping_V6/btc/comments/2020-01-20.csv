"*Admittedly this doesn't count as a merchant, but it's a pretty significant bit of adoption so I figured I'd share it.*

Cryptocurrency company [Mecon Cash](http://meconcash.com/index_en.html) has integrated BCH into its payments platform M.Pay following a cooperation agreement with Bitcoin.com. The platform is connected to one of the biggest providers of ATMs in South Korea, so Bitcoin Cash can now be used to withdraw Korean won in more than 13,000 ATMs in South Korea.

"The US government views cryptocurrency as property. Every time you trade it for something, you owe money on the capital gains. For example, if you buy $100 worth of BCH at $100 per coin, then it goes up to $300 per coin, you will owe capital gains taxes on that $200 profit if you were to trade it for something else (spend it as payment). If you bought $300 worth of food at the store, you would have to pay capital gains taxes on that $200 of gain. The same is true, even if you buy a cup of coffee for $3. $2 would be have to be reported and taxed at capital gains rates.

However, what this bill would do, is exclude all personal transactions in which the person gained $200 or less in profit at the time they spent it. So in the above analogy, the $300 purchase at the grocery store, and the $3 cup of coffee, would both not have to be reported and taxed, because each transaction did not have more than $200 in profit.

"Hard to pick one fatal flaw among many.

The LN is a terrible payment system, even worse than raw crypto.  It saves fees only if run on BTC, because of BTC's intentional congestion.  It is fast only if compared to bitcoin; a vanilla crypto with the bitcoin protocol but 6 blocks per minute (instead of 6 per hour) would probably be faster than finding and negotiating a 10-hop LN payment.  Its protection against fraudulent (or accidentally wrong) closure is imperfect and complicated.  It does not allow sending payments to someone who is offline.  Payments cannot be reversed.  It requires locking up one's coins into multiple channels, and it may take days to transfer funds from one channel to another -- in particular, if the other side is unresponsive.  Any node serving as hub would need a Money Service license and would have to comply with KYC/AML laws.  And it cannot scale to millions of users, unless it is centralized into a single big hub and every user has a single channel to it.

Perhaps the last one is the worst flaw, given its stated goal.  If the LN is to be centralized, then should be compared to Visa , PayPal, ApplePay, AliPay, etc (or even to the late Liberty Reserve) -- and then it will lose badly.";4;0;False;jstolfi;ff26uo1;what is the worst thing about lightning network?;er4yqu;/r/btc/comments/a4o427/what_is_the_worst_thing_about_lightning_network/
"This. Also LN doesn't work (70% chance your transaction completes), it's complicated as fuck to use (requires a 24/7/365 node to run to receive payments), it's insecure, prone to lock-ups and penalties, the spec is incomplete, and it reduces BTC liquidity. 

Maybe you don't know this, but Blockstream knew that Lightning would never work. They just wanted time to implement Liquid, their commercial product that works as a second layer on top of BTC.

The main reasoning, I'm guessing, is that many people will be hurt by things they've committed to the blockchain. The blockchain is forever.

Some examples of this would be:

>""X & Y forever!"" (Five years later X & Y break up.)

>""I completely reject and will never be led by machines."" (20 years later, skynet becomes active, killing all in opposition.)

">Elaborate please?

The IRS [changed tax forms](https://www.forbes.com/sites/shehanchandrasekera/2019/12/20/cryptocurrency-question-on-irs-schedule-1-part-1-of-6/#5d388178673a) to include asking if American citizens own cryptocurrency. Any American 'playing by the rules' filing taxes will therefore need to indicate, under penalty of perjury (by signing the form), when they own cryptocurrency. 

Without this legislation passing such people would be exposed to onerous tax keeping requirements whenever they used cryptocurrency, whether purchasing things online via BitPay, or eating at a newly onboarded Cafe and using crypto. They would need to document *every purchase*, even a $5 cup of coffee. Come tax time they would then need to calculate capital gains and losses on *all* purchases made throughout the year. That's because cryptocurrency is viewed as 'property' by the IRS. So it's equivalent to trading one's physical possessions in commerce (bartering), instead of being treated like currency.

Anyone failing such documentation and submitting required paperwork would be in trouble with the IRS, and cryptocurrency transactions can often leave a trail. So the easiest thing for Average Joe law abiding citizens would be not *using* cryptocurrency at all, maybe just holding it. The only alternative would be not filing tax paperwork at all (which is a strategy many tax protesters do successfully use).

With the $200 threshold, however, a person could truthfully say they do hold cryptocurrency, but if asked why they didn't submit any transactions documentation the answer could be ""I never bought anything over $200"". That's an effective 'out' because now the onus is on the government to try to prove that's false, which is far more difficult than simply proving *any* purchase occurred at all.";10;4;False;cryptos4pz;ff1k8sc;U.S. Congress proposing to exclude cryptocurrency transactions worth less than $200 from the tax base;er3gsb;https://coinworld360.com/u-s-congress-proposes-to-free-small-cryptocurrency-transactions-from-taxes/

Anyway Peter mentioned he got in trouble with the IRS, which is unusual because he, unlike [his father](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irwin_Schiff) who died in jail protesting the government, complies with the tax system.

One year he forgot to file a single form. He had put a house in a trust for his kid and forgot to file the correct tax form, or at least his accountant did. The IRS fined him $200,000! He wasn't evading taxes and the property showed up elsewhere too if I recall, but it was a simple honest mistake, a clerical error. Anyway when he got the news he asked his tax lawyer if he'd heard of the 8th Amendment. Here is the text:

*Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.*

Peter said if a $200,000 fine for not filing a single form wasn't an example of an excessive fine in violation of the 8th Amendment he didn't know what was. So he wrote back to the IRS and said he'd keep listeners updated. He said he didn't want to but was prepared to fight the matter up to the Supreme Court if needed, noting that if he was successful it would be a win for all Americans because it would set precedent and relieve them similarly.

There is no such law that stops fraud. That doesnt make tyranny good. If the law as written were actually followed to the T it will effectively regulate cryptos usage out of existence.

The burden on the state to uniformly enforce such a law or the individual to follow such a law is immense, and it is not feasible for either. Its still not really feasible at the 200 dollar limit either, but it does eliminate many transactions.

Irwin Allen Schiff (; February 23, 1928 ‚Äì October 16, 2015) was an American libertarian and tax resistance advocate  known for writing and promoting literature in which he argued that the income tax in the United States is illegal and unconstitutional. Judges in several civil and criminal cases ruled in favor of the federal government and against Schiff. As a result of these judicial rulings Schiff was in a hospital prison serving a sentence of 162 months (13.5 years) at the time of his death at the age of 87. The Federal Bureau of Prisons reported that Schiff died on October 16, 2015.Schiff is the father of businessman and former United States Senate candidate Peter Schiff.

And

$4 x long term capital gains tax rate on the four dollars of gain from spending my crypto. (15%).

For a total of 6.10 for my 5 dollar burger.

The .50 cent sales tax would be collected and remitted by the store, but id have to keep up with the .60 cent capital gains tax all year. I'd have to do this on every transaction i made. And keep track of every crypto purchase i made.

"> The draft law notes: Cryptocurrency transactions due to changes in exchange rates should not be included in an individual‚Äôs income. **The previous sentence does not apply if the profit exceeds $200.**

Wait, this is much better. This means it's not a $200 transaction limit. It's a $200  capital gains limit. So if something costs $5000, and the price difference in cryptocurrency from the time you bought it to the time you are spending it is only resulting in a $150 profit, then that $5000 transaction is excluded from reporting.

That's true of *some* of them I won't deny. Some are just trying to amplify 'white supremacy' which the vast majority of mainstream Americans, of any political persuasion, don't agree with, including President Trump. [Trump is not a racist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaZZbg-BInc&feature=youtu.be&t=2225). 

The *fringe* militia types you'll hear about mostly now are just exploiting the opportunity, and hiding under the cover of constitutional correctness and patriotism to attempt advancing their own fringe and dying 'white supremacist' ideology. But let the 2nd Amendment come under *serious* assault. That's when you'd see *real* militias crop up, I'm talking people who are now in roles like police officers and sheriffs, and business people and more; those would be the people resisting tyrannical government, and that's how it's meant to be.";1;1;False;cryptos4pz;ff1n7xr;I hope it will take a while until the BCH community will be as flooded with statists as the BTC community [see comments].

"> but Trump himself has repeatedly blatantly violated the constitution. are the militia people complaining about that?

Good question. I'll explain. The system of checks and balances isn't perfect. The 2nd Amendment is just *one* check in the system. The Supreme Court and overall [Separation of Powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers) are another check in the system. Should one part fail, another part picks up the slack. Some abuses by government, however, do slip through, which can't be helped. If you and I are in a verbal argument and you shove me I might not retaliate, because ultimately I don't want to fight you, even if I feel I can win. If you shove me 3 times I still might not retaliate, but there is more danger of it than the first shove. If you rape the women in my family and burn down my house you'd better believe I probably won't rest until I kill you. See the difference? Different levels of abuse elicit different responses. Some abuses are tolerable, given people usually prefer peace, some are not. If people lose their complete ability to resist an out of control government, by being disarmed, that's the end of the game; the government can do anything it wants as we've seen happen various places in the world over time.

"> Probably for good reason since without social contract, you are free but you also have no rights whatsoever.

I agree. Freedom of everyone propelled by law instead of freedom of the few by absence of law.

But, most governments also misuse the wealth they're entrusted with. E.g. intergenerational contracts are mostly fundamentally broken (except for oil producing countries, Norway, or those ripping off the rest of the world, Swiss). Savings don't match the ageing structure of the population in the first place and the money is misused to make ends meet.

I do understand how people jump to the conclusion tax should be abandoned even if I don't agree.

"**Executive Order 6102**

Executive Order 6102 is a United States presidential executive order signed on April 5, 1933, by President Franklin D. Roosevelt ""forbidding the hoarding of gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates within the continental United States"".  The order was made under the authority of the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917, as amended by the Emergency Banking Act the previous month.

The limitation on gold ownership in the U.S. was repealed after President Gerald Ford signed a bill legalizing private ownership of gold coins, bars and certificates by an act of Congress codified in Pub.L. 93‚Äì373 which went into effect December 31, 1974.

What author said is clear:

*""Wright had previously said, under oath, that an ‚Äúencrypted file‚Äù exists, containing both the list of public addresses and private keys. Many took that to mean that when a courier arrived Tuesday with a file, that at last Wright had received the private keys.""*

He doesn't say that file arrived, but he said that many believed that file arrived. But to be fair, it doesn't matter was it file or password, slice or anything else needed to decrypt the file. End result is the same and all you are doing is grasping on last hope that you are right. You are not right though. 



>It was not the encrypted file which was delivered but the key slices to decrypt the encrypted file.

Ok, fine, it can be even bottle with a note inside. It doesn't matter as CSW supposedly received information needed to decrypt encrypted file that contains public and priv keys.

 >Craig Wright already had the encrypted file. Do you see now?

Do I see what? That you are desperate as I can see through all your cloudy explanations? Come on, that is really poor from your side.

   >> Dude, seriously. Don't waste my time. You have no clue what you are saying

>No just look at points one and two. This is what was said in court all along. He had the file. He even had most of the key slices. He received more key slice/s which enabled him to decrypt the file and give the public keys to the court.

Your point one and two are leading mercifully to the same outcome that Craig is a liar that is losing his way in ocean of lies. It very very obvious.

>Do you see now?

Of course. Plain and clear.

>If you had in fact read the court documents you would have known that it was the key slices to decrypt the file that were needed.

All I see is that you are yourself in a way backpedaling. Whether CSW received slice or file is not relevant from case point of view. End result is exactly the same.

No just look at points one and two. This is what was said in court all along.  He had the file. He even had most of the key slices. He received more key slice/s which enabled him to decrypt the file and give the public keys to the court.

Do you see now?

>What is the lie he told in this case?


Here is Craigs declaration:

>(23). Access to the encrypted file that contains the public addresses and their associated private keys to the Bitcoin that I mined, requires myself and a combination of trustees referenced in Tulip Trust I to unlock based on a Shamir scheme.

If CSW lawyer said that he (CSW) hasn't got priv keys after receiving information/slices/file from courier, that implies CSW is guilty of perjury. I am looking forward to CSW explanation on that. Probably some fantasy on tulip trust number 2768768 that will be delivered in 3028.

>>Author was 100% accurate in his article and your attempts to divert are pathetic

>Author was not accurate when he said it was the encrypted file that was delivered. The same point you agreed with him on though now you are backtracking

I am not backtracking and author was right. Read the article:

*Wright filed a statement in the Southern District of Florida late Tuesday asserting that he had received information to unlock an encrypted file of thousands of public Bitcoin addresses that he claims to own. Wright had previously said, under oath, that an ‚Äúencrypted file‚Äù exists, containing both the list of public addresses and private keys. Many took that to mean that when a courier arrived Tuesday with a file, that at last Wright had received the private keys.*

>>Whether CSW received slice or file is not relevant from case point of view.

>It's relevant because both you and the author and Roger Ver thought that it was the encrypted file that was delivered, and more errors flow from that.

No. No errors come from that as author said clearly that **information** was delivered. I personally don't care whether it was slice/password/file or anything as this is absolutely irrelevant. You are only using it to divert. You are fixating on term ""file"" just like you are fixating on Roger, but it all doesn't matter at all.

What is important is that Criag said he is waiting for courier to get access to public and priv keys. Now his lawyer said there are no priv keys and CSW is back-pedalling in his articles.

Personally, I do not even believe there was any courier as nothing here makes any sense. It is just another lie from Craig.

Discussion with you inspired me to write everything down and make my own article about it as level of your delusion and diversion warrants attention.

 >>I DID and I am not following anybody.

>Well how did you all get the same point wrong?

Maybe we did all get the same point right?

>And why do you uncritically accept anything that author wrote? You are following him

"Well, Calvin mines with whatever amount of SHA256 he has, let's say he has 50% of BSV hash rate, so he mines about half a million USD worth of whatever SHA256 coins per day (it's [equally profitable](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/mining_profitability-btc-bch-bsv.html#log) to mine BTC, BCH or BSV now). So in one scenario he mines BSV. There's no benefit, since if he sells BSV - he gets only downward pressure on BSV price. If he doesn't sell - he spends about half a mil usd per day on electricity.

Mining BCH with at least some fraction of the hashrate makes sense in this regard, because he gets BCH, insta-spends BCH for USDT (creating downward pressure on BCH) and waits for times when liquidity is low. Let's say he uses 50% of his hashpower on BCH, 50% on BSV. So, he gets about $250K worth of USDT per day, about $7M per month. Now, he sells this pretty impressive amount for BSV all at once on some low-liqudity exchange. That creates a big nice green candle for BSV and a big FOMO moment, while arbitragers equalize the price on other exchanges, where liquidity is also low at the moment. 

Basically he gets exactly the same amount of money back in form of BSV, but each BSV is now much more expensive.

This scenario doesn't require Calvin to be the only one on exchanges and it includes electricity concerns. Makes sense?";6;1;False;readcash;ff47w7q;Is that how pump and dump works?;erimqh;https://i.redd.it/7ox2r9acozb41.png

Instead it's merchant who will pink promise to secure the network despite having 0 penalties for dropping Nano overnight.

But the biggest kicker for Nano is the only news you ever hear is how they made confirmations 1/2 second faster, with no proof of scaling, adoption and other important metrics. Reading the Nano sub is like groundhogs days.

Miners have to put skin in the game by investing into ASIC's and remain mining for years to break even and thereby security is strong incentivized.

If whales are the only ones securing the network than it will become centralized over time. Not much better than EOS's 21 delegates. Currently Binance is leading I believe and 3 pools are centralizing Nano with no pressure NOT to centralize.

I hope though that nano survives by the way and gets better and more innovative to give it value through that.

"Thanks for your vigilance u/cm18, but you're reading the text incorrectly. Recap:

*For purposes of this section, the term ‚Äòvirtual currency‚Äô means a digital representation of value that is used as a medium of exchange and is not otherwise currency under section 988.*

This is simply a legal way to describe cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. Section 988 of the code has to do with foreign currencies. Bitcoin is *not* considered a foreign currency (and it's not, because no government created it). The sentence describes virtual currency. It says it is a 'digital representation of value' that is used as a medium etc.  and continues by saying '**is not** otherwise currency under section 988', which is correct, because again section 988 has to do with citizens having transactions in foreign currency (such as euros, or pesos). This is a legal definition, not a categorical reassignment. If it was a reassignment it would have to say so.

The legalese must be specific in this way because otherwise it could be misinterpreted as applying to foreign currencies too, which is not the intent of the bill.

"Real talk. This is an issue regardless of who it happened to. I‚Äôve said before and will say it again, normal internet users can‚Äôt keep an email or social media account secure so how are they going to reliably secure a seed/key? Especially if it means they might not have anything until the next paycheck. 
Maybe it got stolen, maybe he forgot his password, maybe he fat fingered his password. Doesn‚Äôt matter, this will happen.

""In 1994, he was arrested by German police for trafficking in stolen phone calling card numbers. He was held in custody for a month, released and arrested again on additional hacking charges shortly afterward. He was eventually convicted of 11 counts of computer fraud, 10 counts of data espionage, and an assortment of other charges. He received a two-year suspended sentence ‚Äì because he was underage at the time the crimes were committed.[36] The judge in the case said the court viewed his actions as ""youthful foolishness"".[37]""

""Dotcom moved to Thailand to avoid investigation[10] where he was subsequently arrested on behalf of German authorities.[37] In response, he allegedly pretended to kill himself online, posting a message on his website that from now on he wished to be known as ""His Royal Highness King Kimble the First, Ruler of the Kimpire"".[37][41] He was deported back to Germany where he pleaded guilty to embezzlement in November 2003 and, after five months in jail awaiting trial, again received a suspended sentence, this time of 20 months.[40] After avoiding a prison sentence for a second time, he left Germany and moved to Hong Kong in late 2003""";-2;1;False;atlantic;ff3jhm4;Kim Dotcom: ‚Äú The numerous sites I created had over a billion users.

"> If you still have to track every transaction and calculate 'profit' its not really going to help.

But that's just it: you don't. Even in a worst-case scenario, you would just spend under $200 at a time. And that is an extremely unlikely scenario.

From a comment I wrote elsewhere:

As long as it was under $200 it wouldn't matter, even in an absolute worst-case scenario where you had no recollection and/or records of any of the cryptocurrency assets you owned and assumed you purchased them when they were 1 cent each in 2010. You could always spend $200 without worry.

But that is pretty unreasonable. All you need to know is what the lowest price of some of the coins was that you purchased. Take Bitcoin for example. Let's say I know it was purchased at some point(s) between 2018 and today (January 2020), but I don't know which coins were purchased when, and/or which coins I am spending. Perhaps I know the exact price of the cheapest coins I purchased. Perhaps I don't. Let's use the latter.

In the case of the latter, if I know the date range of the period I bought of some of the coins I owned was, but not the exact date, I could just use the lowest price of Bitcoin for that date range. In the case of January 2018 to today, that price was about $3200.

$3200 divided by $8650 is .37

This means any time I am spending something, I need to remember that 63 cents of every dollar is capital gains.

Since I know my limit is $200 of capital gains per transaction, I know I can safely spend $298 (200 divided by .67) per transaction without ever possibly being in violation of the law.

EDIT: And I can just do that each time I buy something, divide the lowest common denominator (in this case $3200) by the current price of the cryptocurrency.

And again, even in this complete amnesiac situation you are describing, I know that I can always make purchases up to, in the absolute worst-case scenario, $200.";3;0;False;333929;ff3wp5o;Proposed bill in US House of Representatives to allow any personal transaction to be excluded from Income Tax as long as **PROFIT** is less than $200.

My plan is basically to donate BCH to your congressman.  Works something like this.

1. Find your [congressman](https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative)
2. Ensure your registered to vote since congressmen will pay more attention to a registered voter than an unregistered voter.
3. Join the political party of your congressman.  You don't have to vote party ticket, but party rolls are public record.  Your congressman will pay more attention to a registered voter in their party than one in an opposing party.
4. Use google to find their campaign page, not their Congressional page.  The two are different.
5. Make a $10 donation through their campaign page and record all the answers you gave in the questionnaire.  Be truthful.  Donations are public record and a politician will pay a lot more attention to a donor than a non-donor.
6. Find the mailing address for correspondence off of the campaign web-page for the congressman.
7. [Make a paper wallet](https://github.com/pointbiz/bitaddress.org) depositing $10 in BTC to it.  Ensure you ***KEEP THE PRIVATE KEY***.
8. Write a letter to the congressman making ***NO*** political position, only requesting that they accept your small campaign contribution.  Include in your letter all the questions and answers you filed away in [5] as well as the paper wallet.  Provide some basic instructions for sweeping a paper wallet and mention that the wallet will be void after 12 months.
9. Use the congressman's House.gov website (not the campaign website) to request a meeting with the congressman or his staff.  Yes, they do this, its their job.  Tell them you would like to discuss ""Virtual Currency Tax Fairness Act of 2020"" sponsored by congresswoman Suzan DelBene of Washington's 1st District.
10. You will likely meet with a staff member, don't be offended.  Simply make your case to them and also provide your arguments in written form.  Some offices may require you transcribe the message onto their letterhead.  Don't be offended, just do it.
11. Check the address in the paper wallet every month or so to see if the funds have moved.  If they do move send a letter, tweet or call to the congressman's campaign thanking them for accepting your bitcoin donation.
12. If the funds don't move for 12 months, sweep them back to your wallet and send a letter, tweet, or call to the campaign informing them that the wallet had expired and offer to make them another.  They will decline.

Done.  You've done your bit and it only cost you $10 to $20 and a shit-ton of time.  The above really kinda works for any interaction you want to have with the government.  I've used it before and it helped quite a bit.

"> I find this, however, a very weak argument

why? my basic stance is if you choose to live in a country you also consent to the laws there. thats should not be controversial at all. you could argue that if the laws vastly changed the status quo that you did not consent to that, and id agree. i dont find this controversial either. if you wanted to argue that the nuremberg laws were not vastly changing the status quo around there you *could* make that point because there were lots of anti semitic and racist laws around the world, and in germany at the time, but the it gets a little too scholary, and i dont think neither if us would argue that the nuremberg laws didnt vastly change the status quo. 




> How about yours? From the information given, I suspect it would be yes.

thats pretty offensive, given ive also made these two statements.

> ... for them to knowingly ""consent"" to (not that i think a state or any entity ever can be given the power to kill someone else), 

and

> ... you could say that, if it wasnt because the nuremberg laws removed their citizen rights, rights to fair trial.

\ 

> Just to clarify, my argument here is that those who stayed did consent, according to your logic

the please read my statement again:

> you could say that, if it wasnt because the nuremberg laws removed their citizen rights, rights to fair trial

thats changing the status quo quite a lot dont you agree? 

> Yes. It‚Äòs called right to private property.

i dont think there is. there are several issues with this. what if there is no property left for you to own? what if you dont have any money? who is supposed to make this available to you if its a right? or.. do you have to earn the private property yourself? because that sounds a lot more like what a typical libertarian would think, but thats a hell if a lot less like a right...

> I don‚Äòt understand this sentence.

you said that there was no place where you could live ""state free"" (or whatever you want to call it), and while you have a point that its probably very hard (you could sail to the middle of the ocean or go to space technically), its not a fact that should prohibit a state from governing its lands. ie. they are not obliged to make such a place available to you.

> Now you‚Äòre shifting the argument. Before, it was ‚Äúyou consent by staying in a country‚Äù. Now it‚Äòs ‚Äúyou consent by working‚Äù. Which one is it?

one does not preclude the other you know? besides, i did specify living *and* working. while you might not agree that you have to concent to the laws of the country you live in, it might be easier for you to accept this much more simple causal relationship. you are basically being told beforehand: ""if you want to  work and live here, use the roads and generally benefit from this ordered society you have to pay taxes also"". then you work and afterwards cry ""thieves!"". well. then dont live and work there if you dont want to pay taxes. absolutely your choice, but dont pretend you somehow have the right to live in that state and work and not pay taxes.

> Further, you didn‚Äòt answer my question, you only raised new ones. How can it be consent if it is impossible to avoid the consequences, i.e. I cannot legally not pay taxes anywhere on earth?

what you are basically arguing here is that because there are a lot of other countries that does the same then country x should not do so too, because thats unfair to you, because you have no place that conforms to your wishes, so states should change to your need.

im sorry, but thats how i see it. its like you want it both ways. we start out with a completely libertarian society with no rules and lots of space for people to fill. then man invents fire and later when states evolve, thats suddenly no longer ok. well, we had the free market. turned out states were pretty successfull in that competetion.

> It‚Äòs the ‚Äúpeacefully‚Äù part that makes all the difference.

be careful here, because if you think about it nothing you own has been obtained peacefully. who owned your house before you did? what right did they have to the land? all the way back. and everything produced on that land too. ""acquired peacefully"" is a nice and warm statement, but in the end meaningless, because of hundreds and thousands of years of history. well, we are here now, and this is what is here. its not perfect, but our representative democracies beats living on corporate owned land 

in the end the ""magical fairy dust"" you cant seem to grasp is the legitimacy of the state. you might not agree that its legitimate, but ""taxation is theft"" is line of the most stupid libertarian memes out there - and you seem smarter than that.";0;0;False;slashfromgunsnroses;ff40fvd;I hope it will take a while until the BCH community will be as flooded with statists as the BTC community [see comments].

"Today, police is checked by legal entities, they are by far not above the law. Not sure if you are from Germany, but i.e. in Germany, the police actually does not have many rights and is very controlled.

So, in your vision of a voluntary, corporate controlled system, people that are disabled or are otherwise unable to work or lazy will simply die - there is no social safety net. Also, there would be no anti-trust laws and monopolies would be able to form freely since there is no entity preventing such a thing. In such a world, it is easily imaginable that there is a monopoly controlling all the infrastructure that ordinary citizens have to pay a fee for. Since you as a person have no rights to partake in corporations and how they run the world, you have no power whatsoever. So the end result would be: You pay a fee to be able to live in such a world but you have no power. Seems worse than paying taxes where at least you have a say in how the world is run? Plus, if you get sick and you can no longer work, at least there is a safety net so you're not left to die?

...

So I watched the video and there was no mention of monopolies.  What if there is only one rights enforcement agency because it became so big it essentially managed to wipe out the competition? Yeah yeah, the market will sort things out but history is already filled with examples that show that market failures do happen. And a system in which a market failure means that you may end up under a dictatorship from a random agency, that seems worse than the risks democracy and the social contract model pose.

I do understand the points that are made against governments, but they are simply not true if you take into account that governmental systems can be iterated on and thus be made better and optimized  (and we do that of course, albeit slowly - but for good reason slowly).

Its not about the US Dollar specifically, but fiat currency. The US dollar has lost over 30x its value since the 70's, The Federal Reserve has destroyed its purchasing power.

If you don't have a savings and work on min wage, its much harder to accumulate wealth when your money buys less every year. This is the root cause of the minimum wage dispute, people blame businesses for their lowered purchasing power instead of looking at the Central Banks.

I‚Äòm from Germany, too, and I know that interacting with the police is very pleasant and peaceful here.

This is a big exception in the world though, especially in 3rd world countries, or even just the US, where crimes committed by the police often go unpunished.

What about those countries? Who protects you from the police there?

>So, in your vision of a voluntary, corporate controlled system, people  that are disabled or are otherwise unable to work or lazy will simply  die - there is no social safety net.

No that‚Äòs not true, and a red herring. The idea that only a state can provide a social safety net is absurd. Charities and insurances are much more efficient and much cheaper than Arbeitslosengeld ever could.

>Also, there would be no anti-trust laws and monopolies would be able to  form freely since there is no entity preventing such a thing

No that‚Äòs not true. Economics prevents monopolies to form, and if they do, they are either short-lived or benevolent. Arguments supporting the idea of natural monopolies are addressed here: [https://mises.org/library/myth-natural-monopoly](https://mises.org/library/myth-natural-monopoly).

Further, government by definition is a monopoly.

>In such a world, it is easily imaginable that there is a monopoly  controlling all the infrastructure that ordinary citizens have to pay a  fee for

No, that‚Äòs an absurd scenario in a free market. It is guaranteed in a state, though.

>Since you as a person have no rights to partake in corporations and how they run the world, you have no power whatsoever

That is simply false. The *only* people that *fully determine* how corporations do business are the customers. Customers as a whole have all the power over a corporation. A CEO, board of directors etc is simply implementing what customers desire.

>Seems worse than paying taxes where at least you have a say in how the world is run

On face value, voting as a customer and voting in an election might seem equivalent, but as a customer, you have much more power, as companies are forced to honor your vote, otherwise they go out of business. A government can ignore the will of the people, and very often does, and often goes unpunished for doing so.

Also, your choice whether to buy Netflix or HBO influences your life immediately and directly, whereas voting in an election only has a very small chance to actually change anything at all.

>So I watched the video and there was no mention of monopolies.  What if  there is only one rights enforcement agency because it became so big it  essentially managed to wipe out the competition?

How? If the REA is much more efficient/cheaper/better than the competition, it will be a benevolent monopoly, and if it isn‚Äòt, competition will easily arise.

And security is one of the easiest to provide goods. I‚Äòve even seen people on /r/wasletztepreis offer to sell it.

>Yeah yeah, the market will sort things out but history is already filled with examples that show that market failures do happen

For example? Often, those are actually caused by government intevention.

>I do understand the points that are made against governments, but they  are simply not true if you take into account that governmental systems  can be iterated on and thus be made better and optimized  (and we do  that of course, albeit slowly - but for good reason slowly).

Governments, over time, only become more wasteful and inefficient, until they collapse. This has happened in Germany many times‚Äîresulting in many hyperinflations. The most recent example is Argentinia, where the government just a few years ago declared bankrupcy. If you think this won‚Äòt happen to the Bundesregierung in the next ten years, I recommend you watch this video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKK8W09jaCI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKK8W09jaCI) (German), and possibly others of that channel which go into more detail why the same thing will happen in Germany eventually, if you‚Äòre interested. Note the channel is not an anarchist one.

I'm not so pessimistic, I believe we can improve our systems and through advancements of technology become a society with a universal basic income which will eliminate many problems in the far future.

To be honest, on your other points I cannot really comment on them because I'm not educated enough on the topics. But I have a feeling that a lot of economists also do not really know if their models behave in the real world as they think they would. I mean we see that today with the monetary policy of the ecb. And if current economists of our system can not predict 100% how it is behaving, how can you be sure that what you and others are proposing will function exactly like you described?

"It comes across as concern trolling, to be honest.

The best way to ""steelman"" is to look at what the other side has to say, rather than guessing. The problem is I have already considered and dismissed most of their arguments over the last 4 years.

Yes scaling on-chain has a cost. That was a known limitation of the system from the beginning. What happened is that a minority throwing their money around decided that small blocks were one of the most important features of the system. 

From the outside, it looks like deliberate sabotage. The discussion has been shaped by [censorship and propaganda, rather than rational aruments](https://blog.plan99.net/the-resolution-of-the-bitcoin-experiment-dabb30201f7).

> **Nobody knows what‚Äôs going on**

> In the span of only about eight months, Bitcoin has gone from being a transparent and open community to one that is dominated by rampant censorship and attacks on bitcoiners by other bitcoiners. This transformation is by far the most appalling thing I have ever seen, and the result is that I no longer feel comfortable being associated with the Bitcoin community.

>Bitcoin is not intended to be an investment and has always been advertised pretty accurately: as an experimental currency which you shouldn‚Äôt buy more of than you can afford to lose. It is complex, but that never worried me because all the information an investor might want was out there, and there‚Äôs an entire cottage industry of books, conferences, videos and websites to help people make sense of it all.

> In August 2015 it became clear that due to severe mismanagement, the ‚ÄúBitcoin Core‚Äù project that maintains the program that runs the peer-to-peer network wasn‚Äôt going to release a version that raised the block size limit. The reasons for this are complicated and discussed below. But obviously, the community needed the ability to keep adding new users. So some long-term developers (including me) got together and developed the necessary code to raise the limit. That code was called BIP 101 and we released it in a modified version of the software that we branded Bitcoin XT. By running XT, miners could cast a vote for changing the limit. Once 75% of blocks were voting for the change the rules would be adjusted and bigger blocks would be allowed.

> The release of Bitcoin XT somehow pushed powerful emotional buttons in a small number of people. One of them was a guy who is the admin of the bitcoin.org website and top discussion forums. He had frequently allowed discussion of outright criminal activity on the forums he controlled, on the grounds of freedom of speech. But when XT launched, he made a surprising decision.

For a variety of reasons, polls don't tell you much. There's no way to reach everyone (and everyone only once), there's no cost to signal a viewpoint.

">Bold mine. The calculations are not shown, but it is obvious Satoshi did back-of-the envelope calculations for GB scale blocks on 2009 hardware.

The calculations are not shown, because they don't exist, or were just incorrect estimates. That's evident from all the efforts to progress on-chain scaling since, with very slow progress.

No blockchain has been able to demonstrate more than some 10's of MB on working live networks to this date, without [hitting node crashing failures](https://www.trustnodes.com/2018/11/11/bitcoin-cash-processed-277-tx-s-more-than-paypal-five-32mb-blocks-mined-bu-nodes-crash). 

I'll believe your assessment when it can be demonstrated, not on a teensy test net with a few computers sending blocks back and forth, but on a real one, where blocks need to propogate cleanly in just a few seconds, and not crush the node count down below 4 digits. I'm not saying it will never be possible, but it's obviously no where near as possible today (or 10 years ago) as you're suggesting.

>My third link mentions it in the comments: about 3cents/kB.

My point with this was not that it would be prohibitively expensive, but that you would need to rely on and trust someone else to offer this service to you. Determine the rulesets you have access yo, watch how you access your money, and even determine whether you can. Maybe it's possible that offering this service could be so broadly available that competition would limit the potential for abuse, but there would be massive economies of scale in offering this, and so I don't see that as likely.

"There is nothing wrong with my understanding but yours. You cannot hold any assets on any blockchain if you don't pay for it. It's not free.

And Ethereum's value comes from people buying Ethereum to be able to transact and create assets on the blockchain. It's not different from Bitcoin requiring Bitcoin's to paid to be able to create an Omni transaction onchain by paying with Bitcoin, thereby creating more demand for Bitcoin's. You cannot hold assets on any blockchain without buying the base currency, Ethereum or Bitcoin.

As demand increases buying pressure increases and raises the price of the blockchain currency that is being bought for whatever purpose. Do you not agree or understand?

Verblock is proof of this. They purchase Bitcoin's so that they can create Bitcoin transactions so that they can peg their chain to Bitcoin's. Same with USDT via Omni. Where you not aware of this business model?
