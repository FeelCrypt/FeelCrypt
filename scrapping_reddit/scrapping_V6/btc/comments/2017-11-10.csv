I have asked before what kind of consensus they have from miners (since they say they do) but no reply to that.
So we simply don't know anything about what miners will accept since there even is no ""voting"" going on (correct me if I'm wrong on this point!)

So AFAIK ABC is currently using dictatorship to do this ""upgrade"".
I agree that the upgrade needs to happen, but to short notice, algo out of the blue without prior discussion. And a press release without any information via the normal channels... Also note that this was done via the ABC client. Not the Bitcoin Cash Spec repo which we should expect to have this information first.

To reiterate: announcements of breaking changes should if at all possible be done via the Spec repo first. So that discussions can be made. If a client then decides, ""we will implement it like this and you can run it if you want"" that's fine.

"> My confusion is why wouldnt you want both chains to exist?

What makes you think I don't?

Segwit was shoehorned in using a coersive soft fork, along with lies and deception with ""agreements"" to increase the blocksize afterwards.

If it had been announced as an altcoin fork, and actual Bitcoin left alone, I would have been fine with it.

The problem is not with Segwit coin - the problem is that they used Segwit to kill off Bitcoin, then tried to lay claim to the name.  It's quite a few things, **but it's not Bitcoin**.

> Bitcoin is far from perfect and the technology needs to be scaled appropriately.

Bitcoin is dead.  Segwit Coin certainly has issues with scaling that should be addressed.

> Since you are a BTC/BCH holder, what is your purpose for completely dismissing the fact that it is in all of our best interests for both to succeed in the future?

I want both to succeed.  What I don't want is people misleading people (particularly new people to CryptoCurrencies) into thinking that SegWit Coin is the classic Bitcoin.  It's not, and it's deceptive to try to market things that way.

If you want a spiritual successor to Bitcoin, there's Bitcoin Cash, which is actually usable, and provides the same experience as Bitcoin once did.

Digital peer-to-peer cash is exciting and groundbreaking.  Four hour wait times and an inability to buy anything without a $20 fee is not.  If we're going to introduce people to cryptos, Bitcoin Cash makes a lot more sense.

> The naming convention is arbitrary, but it just doesnt make sense for the campaign to continue in which people are saying Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin. 

The naming convention is arbitrary, but it just doesnt make sense for the campaign to continue in which people are saying Segwit Coin is Bitcoin.

If any coin has claim to the name Bitcoin, it should be Bitcoin Cash.  Bitcoin Cash is a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, and a distributed ledger of signature chains.  Segwit coin is neither of those two things.

> Also, since you are an engineer, why do you take the current state of Bitcoin as the 'end state', forgetting that its a work in progress (as is BCH).

I don't.  If you buy a car, rip off the wheels, attach cables to the wheels, and use it to lift an elevator car up and down, it's not a car anymore.  It's not useless, but that's not an ""innovation"" in cars either.

**When you change something so it no longer does the very thing it was designed and defined to do, it's no longer the thing it originally was.**

Words have meaning, and attempting to redefine Bitcoin into something fundamentally incompatible with the original design principles results in losing what it was that made it Bitcoin.

Bitcoin with 8MB blocks is still bitcoin - it originally didn't have a blocksize limit.  Bitcoin without a distributed chain of signatures is not Bitcoin anymore.

> If you are a holder of BTC, why bash it on this sub?

The same reason you get after Bitcoin Cash - people pretending it's something its not.  I also don't like the deceptive way in which it's been taken over and much of its usability destroyed.

I *liked* Bitcoin.  I'm not particularly happy it's dead.

> I guess I am having a hard time understanding your incentive to label BCH as Bitcoin when you yourself hold a 20:1 ration of BTC/BCH.

I'm an Engineer.  I care about design and accuracy.  Segwit coin is useful, but no amount of holdings or usefulness are going to change that it *intrinsically* violates the very definition of Bitcoin, making it **not Bitcoin**.

> Someone in your shoes should want both chains to scale properly and provide requisite benefits.

Again, who says I don't?

I supported Segwit 2X for the same reason that I support Bitcoin Cash.  If Bitcoin were still around, I'd support it too, but if that were the case, SegwitCoin would be dead.  Without the UASF brinkmanship, Segwit never would have activated, or would have had a chain death spiral.";2;1;False;;dpmokl4;Bitcoin merchants right now;7c0eds;https://i.redd.it/fxr5pd4ho4xz.jpg

Since you are a BTC/BCH holder, what is your purpose for completely dismissing the fact that it is in all of our best interests for both to succeed in the future?  The naming convention is arbitrary, but it just doesnt make sense for the campaign to continue in which people are saying Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin.  By simple language definition, it is not and continuing that facade will just confuse people.  You have to at least agree w/ that??

Also, since you are an engineer, why do you take the current state of Bitcoin as the 'end state', forgetting that its a work in progress (as is BCH).  Bitcoin has to evolve to survive, just like any piece of software.  If you are a holder of BTC, why bash it on this sub?

My background is in software engineering, though I'm in management at the present.  I make a lot more building things that use cryptocurrencies than speculating in them.

For the solutions I build that use cryptocurrencies, it's the usability as a medium of exchange that provides value, not it's value as a speculative asset store.

As for Bitcoin Cash being a ""lowcost alternative"", it's the effective rate of return that matters, not the nominal cash price.  The specific dollar amount is in many ways arbitrary - Satoshi could have set the supply at double, or half, and it would change the nominal cash price but have little change on its intrinsic worth, beyond some psychological value.

I'm one of those crazy people that actually bought things, regularly, with Bitcoin - ""**A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System**"".  

My biggest issue with Segwit coin is that it's deliberately had its transaction volume artificially constrained to the point that it's utility as a medium of actual exchange for most normal transactions has been effectively eliminated.  It's changed things from peer-to-peer electronic cash to node-to-node electronic brokerages.

> That's actually a very good point. I bet from his perspective he wants to justify continuing to mine the legacy chain for now without getting crucified by the BCH crowd.

Yeah see I saw it all the time as a fight *within* Bitcoin to get to a sane compromise.

The miners rather see the 'exit' as the right approach. I suspect this might be a) a cultural issue and b) one of efficiency. See also Jihan's tweet, praised by the small blockers, about building stuff and not fighting.

The market itself might do the fighting part soon enough.

I hope that a side result from this is that Cash will develop better decision making processes. I think they'll be a lot more miner heavy and ultimately depend on the 51% - as it should. 


But the fight is over, and Core folks clearly have won and we lost. They can enjoy their coin now - they might not *at all* enjoy the incentives of the miners going forward, though. Bitcoin gold is gold now: They have clearly demonstrated their willingness to never increase on-chain capacity.

And if it flips, anyone who wasn't *actively* getting rid of Cash kept their coins. So there's that, keeping the balance sheet intact.";1;1;False;awemany;dpmkvht;"""Be friend with other competing coins, learn from them, and make BCH better.

Yes, maybe it is a matter of perspective: Old awemany thinks he lost the 2x fight and that's the perspective I wrote it from, new awemany thinks this BCH might actually have preserved the original vision. 

The time to cheer will be when market cap, cumulative difficulty and transaction rate (the easy one) are at number 1.

Not easy, especially with being in spot #3 now, but IMO very possible.

Cash shows that they can. Whether that is true long term, will depend a lot the price of the respective coins.

If it is fast, it will become more bumpy. If the miners start hating a low difficulty coin, it becomes dangerous for that one.

Litecoin opted to instead decrease blocktime, which is _way_ worse for any potential ""centralization"" than bigger blocks, as that makes very-short-interval blocks that are latency-sensitive (instead of bandwidth-sensitive, a very solvable problem) much worse.

Okay, you got a point there. Maybe my argument was to simplified. But look at situations where there could be bloodshed and conflict and they are actually solved by law and governance. It's always easy to point out the bad examples as a justification why this whole world is a mess. It's called cherrypicking and selection bias, for example about banks being the ultimate evil (yes, this is the rhetorics). But banks have a long history, the youngest history about regulating the monetary system via central banks. There may be crisis, yes, their may be doomprophets, their may be big flaws. But saying that the whole system is corrupt and deregulated, decentralized cryptocurrencies are freeing People in my opinion is a dangerous fallacy. In the end you trust THE MARKET to bring out the better in mankind, you free those people and leave them to unleashed market forces. But there are layers to this market, layers of corruption, of shill and FUD, of interests. Markets can and will always be manipulated. Capital will centralize around the powerful and rich. Be it new rich elites then, but nonetheless elites. See what happens to BTC: It's becoming a new vehicel for the rich to enhance their riches, to get power beyond power, because you don't have to care for regulations. In my opinion it's madness to believe this is for a good cause. And no, I made Money in this market, too. I'm just concerned about the rhetorics surrounding it, about opinions being oppressed, about communication bubbles, about lacking substantials, about People losing their connection to the value of money because it's enough to follow some uneducated shills and manipulators.

It was the best time to do one, a 2x HF would have reduced fees and seriously reduced BCH appeal and give time for LN or other solutions to mature.

Yet core dev were willing to split the currency on the small capacity increments one can think off..

"> Re: the quote about LN fees being paid to ""liquidity providers"" rather than miners. What are these liquidity providers?

LN has 2 use cases. A) Intra channel B) Cross channel.  

A) Intra channel is EXACTLY the same thing as funding a store-specific Gift Card. And you get to fund it precisely one time. So you have to plan your budget ahead... How many gift cards are you going to buy, from who, and how much are you going to tie-up in each one?  
  
B) Cross-channel is trickier. Whenever YOU act as an intermediary for someone else, the amount transiting through you is reduced from your available balance!! It means that: EVERY hop en route to a destination must have the funds available for each transaction. 

There are only 2 waus to solve this problem:  

A) everyone deposits MUCH much more than they need to transact with, or  
B) the system depends on large centralized hubs. LIQUIDITY PROVIDERS

> And how does this affect the holders?  

You have to pay the LIQUIDITY PROVIDERS that will make you whole. There is a difinitive opportuity cost to it, akin to an interest rate, and trust me, they will ask for it. In addition to a fee for the straight transmission of the cross-channel transaction. BONUS: Although it has not been thoroughly discussed, yet, one can see that we have all the pieces in place here for LENDING.

> I understand that miners are pissed about that, but why should the average BTC user or investor care?  

That's not PEER-TO-PEER ELECTRONIC CASH. THAT'S WHY.

> Are you saying LN is opening a backdoor for governments, bureaucrats and/or traditional banks, on purpose?  

With this banking scheme in place, KYC and AML are going to be mandatory, trust me on that. Those nodes will be whales, easy to identify and coerce by the governement.

"**Hashcash**

Hashcash is a proof-of-work system used to limit email spam and denial-of-service attacks, and more recently has become known for its use in bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) as part of the mining algorithm. The original idea was first proposed by Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor in their 1992 paper ""Pricing via Processing or Combatting Junk Mail"". Later a similar proposal called Hashcash was proposed in 1997 by Adam Back.

So instead you trip over yourself with self-contradicting accusations of how Blockstream is using Segwit, which you so bravely resisted, in their evil schemes that they say is not dependent in any way on Segwit, which means... oh bother.

The initial booms of Bitcoin and other coins have pretty much happened and probably won't happen again. If you're truly serious about investing, just study mutual funds and save money.

In simple terms, BTC's roadmap involves scaling off-chain using 3rd party companies like banks.  BCH's roadmap follows Satoshi's original vision outlined in the whitepaper, which is keeping it decentralized and scaling on-chain.  Blocksize is limited for BTC to eventually force people off-chain to centralized 3rd parties.;3;1;False;monster-truck;dpmfblv;"The Bitcoin company I work for is buying thousands of BCH today (and liquidating all of its BTC); plans to re-deploy all apps under Bitcoin Cash";7bybge;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7bybge/the_bitcoin_company_i_work_for_is_buying/

The problem is that there isn't really a 'standard' for tickers.  BCC was originally proposed, but not everyone used it - in particular, Bitfinex was forced to choose something different because they were already using BCC for their Bitcoin Core chain split tokens from way back when.  Trezor and Ledger also went with BCH - which seems to be rapidly becoming the ticker that most people use for Bitcoin Cash.;3;0;False;roybadami;dpmu3i0;"The Bitcoin company I work for is buying thousands of BCH today (and liquidating all of its BTC); plans to re-deploy all apps under Bitcoin Cash";7bybge;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7bybge/the_bitcoin_company_i_work_for_is_buying/
"No thats BitConnect.
Completely separate. I know, that too is confusing.

BitConnect is traded almost on its own platform exclusively, yet I'm sure people sign up for it completely believing it to be BitCoin, even.

Not saying you are by any stretch. Im acknowledging the confusion on the ticker. And it seems whenever Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash are up/down BitConnect follows in a weird pattern.

Edit - to further add confusion, viaBTC used to called Bitcoin (BCC) upuntil basically just now.
Read the comments in there. You can note how everyone talks about BitConnect and the confusion in there.

"I think BCH kinda has the best of both worlds. It originated as Bitcoin so holders of Bitcoin owned it automatically. This means it also has part of the brand name Bitcoin. And it has lower fees, faster confirmations as well as zero confirmation transactions.

"> In Europe bank transfers from a consumer to any consumer or business turn up in 1 business day, are free,

Your definition of ""Europe"" does not match with mine :-)  And even within SEPA, this isn't true.  If there is any currency conversion, the bank may not give you a fair currency rate (often a somewhat hidden cost with international bank payments), and from Norway (which is a member of SEPA according to Wikipedia, and de-facto a member of the EU for most practical purposes) one will usually be paying fees for receiving and sending money internationally, though it's cheaper and faster to send Euros within SEPA than other international payments.  If I send USD to Bitstamp, it takes much longer time and cost me more than twice as much in fees as if I send EUR to Bitstamp, even if it's sent to the same bank.  Domestic payments are gratis, in most (but not all) banks.

There is the payment service directive and the payment service directive 2, I'm not sure of the details, but at least I do know that if you're in one of the SEPA Euro countries, the bank cannot charge more for Euro transfers within SEPA than for domestic euro transfers.  So if you have a bank account in France and the bank allows gratis domestic payments, then yes - payments to Germany will also be for gratis.  From Portugal to Poland?  Not sure, there is at least the currency conversion cost.

And sending 100.000 EUR?  May work out, but I think the payment may be frozen if it's not obvious that the money comes from proper ""white"" sources.  My bank does not allow me to send any money out of Norway anymore, as they didn't like my Bitcoin reselling activity.";3;1;False;tobixen;dpm4lss;"The Bitcoin company I work for is buying thousands of BCH today (and liquidating all of its BTC); plans to re-deploy all apps under Bitcoin Cash";7bybge;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7bybge/the_bitcoin_company_i_work_for_is_buying/

Argument to moderation (Latin: argumentum ad temperantiam)—also known as [argument from] middle ground, false compromise, gray fallacy, false middle point fallacy, equidistance fallacy and the golden mean fallacy—is an informal fallacy which asserts that the truth must be found as a compromise between two opposite positions.

"People will now be deciding where to place their effort, Bcore or BCH. The death of B2x makes the choice clear, there is no more path for bigger blocks in Bcore, and no path for on-chain apps in Bcore, nor micropayments, etc., etc.

All those use-cases will now flow to BCH, and the next year will be very big for BCH, because value and demand will flow to those applications that Bcore has forsaken.

Bcore will still grow too, it has institutional moment and its dev path has value of its own, and the government and establishment figures will happily adopt the Bcore model.

That's some good wild guessing lol. Horrible analogy that doesn't make sense. Eth scales x10 worse than btc/bch because of the extra data from contracts alone.
