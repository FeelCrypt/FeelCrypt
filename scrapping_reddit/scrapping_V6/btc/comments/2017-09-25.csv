you can find many implementations of LN today on github, but do you really want it to be pushed out before exhaustive testing? This isn't vaporware like eth or iota, it's the secure blockchain.

LN entered in feature freeze across 3 of the implementations in august. https://github.com/cdecker/lightning-integration

here's another one demo https://twitter.com/alexbosworth/status/906012516672618497

That question is to wallet providers. They take forever to add features because as they said they are responsible for losing people's money. See how slow tons of different wallets are at even adding segwit compatibility which has been known and in feature freeze for how long now lol - it's not even necessary now, and they also seem to be very careful in the implementation security even for that. From same conference you had several people show comparisons of how much harder it was to code with tx malleability than without.
