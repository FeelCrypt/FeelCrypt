"> It's important for what it actually is: It's the side arguing for big blocks admitting that, so far, it looks like we'd need to lift the 21M limit to lift the blocksize limit.

No it *doesn't*. Read also what /u/capt_roger_murdock linked.

But I guess just because one shows you that there's no dangerous animal to fear with 99.99% certainty, it still keeps you all anxious and hiding behind the trees.

So much that you rather starve to death while hiding behind the trees.

I guess I can't help you.

>  And while it's very much undesireable in any case, a 51% mining pool would be even worse in an unlimited blocksize scenario.

I am not worried about either scenario, but you can stay on BTC.
Let me just say that when the time comes that you want a blocksize increase, no one will be around to help you to get that.

> The third proviso now is that we can't have XTHIN or something like it, as that would virtually remove the orphaning cost necessary for this blocksize-limit-less fee market to evolve.

Just because it gets reduced, doesn't mean that it becomes zero. Being more efficient is *good*.

We could also run a Bitcoin on Commodore 64s linked through acoustic couplers. Resulting in a great fee market in your reading.

Fee income is not a one dimensional function of blocksize, but also depends on use. A fact you don't like to incorporate in you worldview - and, curiously enough, Greg Maxwell didn't, either.

That said, I was happy with going through compromises on blocksize, including the ridiculously low 2x and argued all for it until it failed by the major players fully abandoning it.

While the other side didn't move at all. 

Given the market and mempool situation for BTC right now, which unfortunately also has a certain stickyness to it, this supposed care for miner income by you and others is being right now exposed as the convenient lie it is.

Another nice exposition that you all ignored the wishes of the mining majority, well informed after years of this debate, to increase blocksize.

They are directly incentivized to maximize income. 

You are saying you care for them yet go and completely ignore their wishes while doing so.

That is *quite* telling and the mental gymnastics are pretty impressive.


> But one glance on the /r/btc frontpage makes it clear that we didn't simply part ways. People like Roger want to claim the bitcoin brand and heavily confuse people in the process

Well, I have repeatedly stated that I call Bitcoin the longest chain by cumulative SHA256 and still do. But that means naming is a dynamic situation that might change. And if it does, Bitcoin Cash can rightfully claim the name Bitcoin. I don't know what I'll call it then, but I take the personal freedom to call it whatever I want. But note I am quite consistent here.

Others have a different definition of what Bitcoin is, relying more on being *faithful to its initial goals*. 

Now, given that *your side* argued *endlessly* that cumulative hash power is not defining Bitcoin, I see a certain symmetry and hypocrisy  ...

> You might be a paid troll and so I might waste my time here.

And while that's probably exactly what a troll would say: I'm not.

If you look far enough back into my post history, you'll find me arguing for bigger blocks alongside Gavin Andresen. That is until I realized that people like Greg aren't the ignorant, stubborn and arrogant ones, I was. And many people in my camp were.

A blocksize increase seemed very easy and straightforward. There had to be something else going on behind the scenes, right? Wrong. Shit's hard, yo. There were many things I haven't considered at the time. Thankfully, I was neither financially nor emotionally invested in the idea of bigger blocks (or smaller for that matter). This allowed the facts to change my mind. [Which sadly doesn't happen very often in general](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/02/27/why-facts-dont-change-our-minds).

> We simply parted ways then.

I'd be perfectly fine with that and would even wish you luck. I think Bcash's roadmap leads to a dead end, but it was properly forked and is a perfectly legitimate project on it's own.

But one glance on the /r/btc frontpage makes it clear that we didn't simply part ways. People like Roger want to claim the bitcoin brand and heavily confuse people in the process.

But you can also easily interpret it in the exact opposite way.

"> Fee income is not a one dimensional function of blocksize, but also depends on use. A fact you don't like to incorporate in you worldview - and, curiously enough, Greg Maxwell didn't, either.

Low fees and high use result in *very* large blocks. A problem you don't recognize as such because doing so would undermine your position. If you want to trust the few entities that will be able and willing to actually run fullnodes and validate gigabyte sized blocks you're free to do that, but don't drag Bitcoin into this. It was created to eliminate the need for trust like that.

> While the other side didn't move at all.

The other side increased block capacity to around 2MB. The deceptively named ""2X"" wanted ~4MB blocks (with an 8MB worst case). That would've netted them a doubling for free and they could've continued with their inefficient usage a while longer. Successfully passing on the costs of their behaviour to the entire network.

Right back at you. I'm not even going to try to untangle that mess.

> Well, I have repeatedly stated that I call Bitcoin the longest chain by cumulative SHA256 and still do.

The longest chain with the most work is the most secure one. Wether or not it is considered bitcoin depends on various other factors. A big indicator that it is would be compatibility with older releases, but that's not necessarily a requirement. Ultimately, everyone has to make an informed decision for themselves here. The issue with Ver and bcash is that many uninformed people are effectively mislead. Whatever good Ver did in the early days, he's undoing that at an insane rate.

In any case, you said ""we"" before. That you currently don't claim that bcash is bitcoin is great, but your initial statement is still wrong.

> I guess it also helps when Core supports who are afraid of btrash come here and try to trash it.

I'm not in the slightest bit afraid of bcash. I dumped it first chance I got. Felt kind of great to get so much money from people I'd consider proud ignorant idiots.

Your whole bigblock narrative is based on FUD about Layer 2. *YOU* are afraid of things you don't understand. SegWit was supposed to be the downfall of bitcoin. Well? Seems to be working. Huh.

The technology evolves and you feel left behind as you have more and more trouble to understand the new tech. 

Wether you like it or not, stuff like LN is coming and this bullshit here will soon be over. There will be new bullshit of course but still, this specific non-sense will finally end in a year or two. Maybe it'll take longer as I tend to underestimate people's ability of self delusion. But bcash and many other altcoins will wither away and surrender to the fantastic work of the intellectuals you so deeply distrust. (Even though everything they do is verifiable.)

Well, as I seem to be talking to a wall, I might as well stop.

"You have an interesting perspective.

Though, perhaps a large portion of *users* did switch to BCH or another coin, and it's only speculators and a subset of users who did not.

In terms of who the ""market"" is, speculators probably currently outnumber users 10:1

Speculators are a fickle bunch, though. I wouldn't place much weight on their bets.";1;0;False;laskdfe;duoww7c;BTC mempool just cleared out for the first time in 3 months!;7zd2tv;https://i.redd.it/hfc3lhwhuph01.png

"I believe what happened was that Bitcoin Core 0.15 was released at approximately that time.  Version 0.15 included a [chainstate database overhaul](https://bitcoin.org/en/release/v0.15.0#performance-improvements) that switched the UTXO set from being indexed on a per transaction basis to a per output basis.  This change decreases reindex and initial blockchain download validation time, decreases memory use, decreases disk IO, but did increase the on disk UTXO size by 15%.

I believe the bump you are seeing there is the 15% increase in UTXO size due to this format change.  There is no corresponding increase in the number of UTXOs at that time.";2;1;False;roconnor;duow42a;BTC mempool just cleared out for the first time in 3 months!;7zd2tv;https://i.redd.it/hfc3lhwhuph01.png

"> even though some people aren't getting paid they might be advertising for free without knowing it

So, people honestly saying that an invention improves their lives is ""free"" advertising""? And that's bad some how?

I just don't get why a person would criticize someone saying ""hey this thing that I like is really awesome, maybe you'll like it too"". You'd have to really hate markets and freedom to feel that way.

I get that you're saying that sometimes, what may *apparently* be genuine flattery for a product could *secretly* be paid marketing. That is a potential problem with anonymous forums, and it is something worth considering when reading anonymous posts.

That said, in principle, there is nothing wrong with singing the praises of something you like. That sub explicitly suggests that there is something wrong with it, and that is what I am criticizing.";2;1;False;fossiltooth;duq1gow;I was randomly reading the sidebar at /r/HailCorporate...;7y1rso;https://i.redd.it/w9p1fvcpzmg01.png
