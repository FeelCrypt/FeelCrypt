"Thanks for sharing your viewpoint on the financial ties. 

Honestly, in isolation I would be okay with *some* overlap between his employees and his mods. (assuming the Reddit rules permit this) These are likely individuals he's known for years, whom he trusts, who have Bitcoin-related experience, etc... so it is understandable from his perspective. 

However, it becomes concerning when the typical narrative in /r/btc is very critical of imagined/assumed financial ties between Core/Blockstream and Theymos and other r/bitcoin mods, and any attempt to claim otherwise gets buried. 

>I'm quite likely to get a different side of your story from bitcoinxio, but I am sorry to hear your experience here.

thanks, I appreciate that.

creationlayer denied being responsible for the 72hr mute and I believe them, although I did not receive a reply when asked to check modlog for who did. Oh well, no real harm... just surprised me. 

>The people you mention, by the way, were all totally non value added trolls. It does not advance your cause with me to hold them up as examples of heavy handed moderation.

To be clear, my examples were to showcase the *inconsistent* application of moderation here, with trolls from the pro-core camp seemingly held to a far higher standard than trolls who were attacking core. 

The three banned people I mentioned likely qualify as trolls, but their conduct appeared within the rules and was infinitely more civil than the people mentioned in my screenshots.

I mean... here's the thread which resulted in tropser & demotruk's bans: https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4tzax1/soupernerd_mod_of_rbtc_is_brigading_posts_with_a/d5lih0t/

"> For example, for some time Greg Maxwell was regularly insinuating that SouperNerd (who himself was a mod at the time) was a serial rapist - and SouperNerd neither banned Greg or even removed these libelous posts.

I agree that was in *very* poor taste.

although in case you didn't catch the reference being made, the *""xxxxx raped and murdered a girl in 1990""* joke / phrase has sort of entered American public consciousness as rhetoric to describe the near impossibility of disproving an absurd & baseless claim made without evidence. 

Here's a surprisingly detailed wikipedia article regarding the phrase, it's usage, and resulting legal challenges:

Ironically, it's actually lengthier than the wiki article on the original:

"I found it super hard to believe as well!

I saw someone following devs around and making various absurd criminal allegations, complete with what appeared to be a threat.

http://imgur.com/B463NqQ (just the tip of the iceberg I'm afraid)

I reported this behavior to the mods.

A week passes and I notice sockpuppet accounts reposting many of the same same BS claims. (minus the threat)  

So... I sent a PM to the mods with further details. (I'd assumed this was ban evasion)

I then discovered that they had not banned any of the users responsible (even the threat guy, not banned) and PM'ed the mods again. Bam, 72hr mute. 

http://i.imgur.com/aaAJR9m.png


I was quite frustrated at the time, as core supporters were being held to **wildly** different standards than the people attacking core.

(this was right around the time Anduckk, tropser & demotruk were banned for dubious reasons)

>you annoy the shit out of me, but I wish you no harm :)

I am sorry to hear I annoy you, and I thank you :)

What do you think of the various claims I've made in this thread? 

It's quite annoying when anything critical of /r/btc gets buried with a flood of downvotes, despite being factually accurate. Various mods do outright admit working for Roger... in fact at one point earlier this year *every single full mod* had public financial ties to Roger.

"I'm glad that Roger is willing to pay to defend your freedom to post here. I wish this wasn't needed, but it is, thanks to Theymos etc.

I'm surprised you got muted, but you didn't get banned.  I guess the mods decided they had heard your case and weren't going to act on it.  The mods here don't act on a lot of this sort of stuff.

I can't agree honestly. Ethereum is next to nothing without bitcoin, so those two might as well be considered paired coins.
