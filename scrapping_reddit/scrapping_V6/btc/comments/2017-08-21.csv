"I wrote them a message about how I like the services they provide and how I have found it difficult to participate in the growing Bitcoin Cash market and how I wished they offered their services for Bitcoin Cash sooner than the beginning of next year. I encourage everyone to also write thoughtful and clear messages to them and not just spam Coinbase with ""Please support Bitcoin Cash"" or ""Why dont you support BCH yet?"". Show them that we are intelligent people that wish to have a better experience provided for handling, transacting and acquiring Bitcoin Cash and that we wish to bring our business to them. This will have greater impact when they see a multitude of requests each unique and see that their users spent time to make this request and that they should listen.



Side note: As a software developer, it takes time to make changes, especially since they would want to add support to the mobile apps. They do need time to put together additional infrastructure and test the new code and load on the network they would introduce by adding this functionality. No one wants a service to add support for a new Cryptocurrency and then the servers they are using cannot keep up with demand and we have a scenario where they become a joke in the community. They need to make sure they do things right and that takes time. And iOS apps take a little longer due to the approval process so they would likely try and get that done first after adding backend support or have to wait on approval to occur to launch the services on all platforms they support at the same time. This may not add a lot of time but it still does add time. I think the roadmap of support at the beginning of next year though is a bit more time than is really needed. They have standards in place (or should) for how to add new cryptocurrencies to their services. They should be able to accelerate them if the money is there and they see the value in making things happen a little quicker.";2;1;False;kenman345;dlx5tho;Let Coinbase know you want Bitcoin Cash support ASAP;6uznlb;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6uznlb/let_coinbase_know_you_want_bitcoin_cash_support/

"I never heard ""slanted"", nor ""tilted"", in this context; the other ""upset"" ones you got right though.

A ""fanboy"" (or ""fangirl""), is someone that is an unconditional fan, that ignores the flaws of what they're fan of and defend it no matter what; in situations where there are competition (like with gaming consoles, or cryptocoins), they also tend to criticize the competition unconditionally.

I think ""Shitcoin"" you also got right.


""Shitposts"" are usually intentionally crappy posts, often done for humorous purposes.
