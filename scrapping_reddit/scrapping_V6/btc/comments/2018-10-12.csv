"This article is a great explanation of liquid. 

> it isn’t possible to improve liquidity while maintaining full decentralization and trustlessness. So Blockstream cheerfully compromises both of these prized features. It appoints a small group of trusted institutions to validate transactions and submit them to the main Bitcoin chain.

> A “Strong Federation” is a cooperative of market participants – called “functionaries” – who collectively validate transactions. Unlike Proof of Work, ... the paper talks about replacing the “dynamic miner set” with a “fixed signer set.” But it isn’t clear from the paper how the signers would be appointed. Who decides who should be a signer? Why should we trust them?

Correct.  Bitcoin-BCH has scaled by increasing the block size, so it will not have capacity issues (high fees or unreliable transactions) when usage increases.

"> I read a lot of opinions on this sub. Just because many people have them doesn't make them facts.

The salient ones which you're unable to grasp clearly make your position untenable. And that is that the BTC sabotage was unjustified and idiotic from the start. There was never any legitimate reason for it, end of story. This is not an opinion, it is a fact.



> Most discussions here about LN for example are just completely wrong

The most commonly discussed failing of LN here is that it is impossible for it to be decentralised in light of the routing problem. This is once again not an opinion, it is a fact. The other stuff like ""can't get a payment through of size n given conditions x-z"" are interesting only for people who care about the function of LN given that *it is impossible for it to be decentralised*. That is not anyone who actually cares about the principles of a decentralised ledger to begin with, so of zero consequence to the discussion.

> and a quick look at the available documentation would show that.

The ""available documentation"" outright lies and obfuscates. The LN whitepaper sums up the solution to the routing problem as ""It'll be something like what happens on the broader internet"", completely negating the fact that's a trusted environment that doesn't have to deal with capacities and already has plenty of problems in and of itself.

The fact you think that given the idiocy you're so confidently parroting now in the face of the collapse of your interpretation of the state of the chains is exactly why I stick to my original diagnosis of you; You are a clueless fucking NPC unable to actually evaluate facts and come to conclusions on your own. You are seeking a truth that you will then regurgitate cluelessly and uncomprehendingly until the next time it is necessary for you to think independently, at which point you will seek a new propaganda fount which will tide you over to the next time, and so on, and so forth.

Anything to avoid *actually having to think for your fucking self*.

You and the hordes of idiots like you are why we can't have nice things.

Everyone here is focused on making Bitcoin better. The stress test was a huge success, the fees didn't rise at all (still fractions of a penny) and we were doing 8x the transactions what BTC has been artificially capped at. 

Multiple times the number of transactions BTC was doing when the fees went up to 55 dollars. This chain can now do more tx/s than PayPal normally does.

This would be a problem if it was a minority valid chain trying to pretend its still Bitcoin. When this definition briefly applied to BCH during August 2017, it was a self-announced minority chain called Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and **NOT** Bitcoin.  

The only time I know of that a minority chain violated this process and tried to illegitimately claim the Bitcoin name was when SegWit1x continued in violation of a [~96% hash rate consensus agreement](https://twitter.com/mikebelshe/status/905737617718870018) at the supposed activation of 2x from the legacy BTC block chain. Instead, the < ~4% minority SegWit1x chain continued, usurping the ""BTC"" ticker, and (following widespread confusion) continued *illegitimately* using the Bitcoin name.  

> I'll just keep on basking in my unbroken chain of blocks....  

Unbroken by what standard? Not Nakamoto Consensus, and therefore the [Bitcoin white paper](https://nakamotostudies.org/literature/bitcoin/) no longer applies. If you want to **believe** your block chain is unbroken, you'll need to write a new white paper which can explain how going from the block before 2x activation to the first block of SegWit1x can ever be seen as **valid**.

In what way is the cap justified now? Were you not there in December when fees spiked to $100 or so? Back then mempool grew so large that the rPi nodes crashed too. So, who exactly benefited from that cap in December? You don't recall Steam abandoning Bitcoin (BTC) for payments because the fees got so ridiculously high? How did that benefit Bitcoin (BTC)? December 2017 was the make it or break it moment for Bitcoin (BTC) and the outcome was a complete disaster. Adam Back, One Meg Greg and other Blockstream scammers single-handedly pushed crypto adaptation back years and didn't learn a thing along the way. Stealing the fees from the miners will eventually lead to a situation where the miners direct their hash elsewhere and nobody is left to secure the Bitcoin (BTC) network nor process any transactions.. this is probably Blockstream's goal though.

This is patently untrue, for BTC.

I was building a 0conf risk assessment algorithm in 2012-2015. My algorithm would have been able to determine whether it is safe within configurable loss margins to release a product on an unconfirmed transaction receipt.

My efforts were resisted by Core developers on the grandest of scales, including personal attacks and hack attempts. My work was undermined not only by other ""cooperative"" coders that sought to mangle my work but by the BTC devs themselves.

In 2015, when Theymos posted his fateful announcement banishing ""90% of Bitcoiners"" from the community, I counted myself among them. I threw away my code and my algorithm and concluded that no, Bitcoin is **not** permissionless.

I am still bothered via PM from Core supporters to this day. Just two weeks ago I received and reported an unsolicited, harassing, and personally attacking PM.

"> You’re blind if you haven’t noticed CSWs attempts to take over BTC on behalf of the gambling cartel. First by pretending to be Satoshi, then when that failed by forking off and trying that approach.

""Attempts"" to direct the future of the chain by acting using the consensus mechanism of the chain, so what? If he wins, he's supposed to, if he doesn't, he wasn't. That's how proof of work actually works. Look at what you're now championing instead; a federation of centralised AMLKYC compliant crypto exchanges completely not subject to the aforementioned consensus mechanism, or anything more complex than the eternal rule of ""because I said so"".

You are a fucking idiot.

> Now, because the community is split and the cartel doesn’t have full control (because BitMain is a huge player) they want to fork off ... again.. this isn’t how decentralized networks work. You can’t just push your views down everyone’s throat and expect chance right away. This isn’t supposed to be CraigCoin right? Unfortunately it has become that.

That's *exactly* how decentralised networks work. If you don't like the way the chain is proceeding you fork off, nobody can stop you from doing it and it's perfectly alright to do if you're convinced that it's necessary. In this way the chain is guaranteed to eventually succeed at one of its ends, and the forks that you're utterly convinced are worthless are effectively simply free offers to increase you stake in the fork you're convinced is the real thing.

By contrast, forcing everyone to stay together on a chain that has now transparently descended to exactly the state everyone knew and said it would for years is not ""decentralised"" at all. It's a parody of decentralisation to retain the power structures of centralisation whilst being simultaneously cheered on by clueless hapless fuckwits like you.

> Media has been twisting everything to make it hard to determine reality. We were told that if Segwit launched, bitcoin would crash and burn. A year in and ... gasp.. were completely fine. 

By ""completely fine"" you mean the entire consensus mechanism of Bitcoin has been overriden completely, and the system is now nothing but a centralised shitty ripple clone still being loudly cheered for by clueless fuckheads who can't even tell that's the case.

Miners were always a tool to be used for their selfish economic incentives. Assuming a moral duty is the complete antithesis of what Bitcoin was supposed to be. The market will ultimately decide the value of BTC and the miners will reassemble to maximize their self-interest. The problem is that Core took the most popular, , secure, and ubiquitous distributed consensus network and totally bungled the whole thing up, now leading us down a less than desirable timeline whereby BTC is unlikely to succeed, which is needless and a shame. However, this was one possibility of events that has occurred and we can only move on from where we are and move forward. While it is a shame, there is not much to be done other than cooperate with people who do share that vision, and build something together. I think this is already happening so I feel this whole BTC issue will be a relative historical speed bump as well as serve as a glowing historical example of complete dbags who tried to con people for their own personal profit. ;1;0;False;whuttheeperson;e7nog3u;Forbes destroys Blockstream’s Liquid and exposes it for what it is;9niuo8;https://www.forbes.com/sites/francescoppola/2018/10/11/blockstreams-new-solution-to-bitcoins-liquidity-problem-looks-oddly-familiar/#4ddcf9f21e51
