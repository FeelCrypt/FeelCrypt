"It seems that most problems are related to USD withdrawals and deposits;
are you all located in the US?

trying to understand if this is a regulation/country specific issue or something linked to USD

"> An elite group or a system is currently needed,

That may be true, but the question is whether we have to have an elite group forced on us, or whether we might be able to choose our elites and follow them willingly. Either version provides a viable elite group.

In the economy, elites prove their mettle by running companies and producing products that people want. The same can be done in terms of legal choice and elites in a voluntary private scenario.

> the current system is based on us selecting representatives for our community to sit in a government. 

Yes, representative elites chosen through majoritarianism. Elites who then produce law.

However, the ability to choose law can be redistributed from these elites to individuals, allowing them to choose elites by deciding who to patronize, based on merit instead of votes.

> The problem is how it is organized and the checks and balances behind it.

This creates an automatic check and balance system, because it essentially gives each individual a *veto* over all law. There's no possible greater system of checks and balance than the customer-provider model of the market.


> 
> 
> 
> What is another system? True democracy does not work, a system based on machine? How does that represent what the people want? 

Obviously the market works pretty well to give people what they want. So produce a market for law and the same will be true.

> You also have a significant population who is illiterate on alot of subjects from trade to economics and then military and social policies.

People are illiterate on a lot of engineering topics too, yet they manage to buy cars and houses. Because they observe both trusted reviews, reviews from many buyers and the wisdom of crowds, and they see the results other people are getting. Then they choose for themselves, and it works pretty well, even for big decisions like buying a new car.

That's better than relying on majoritarianism which is subject to rational ignorance of voters.

> If you relied on the average person, there will never be any clear direction as people are inherently reactionary leading to a change of direction in overall policy alot more often than normal. This becomes highly inefficient and can lead to some bad results.

Over time, people figure it out based on results being achieved, no matter what, ***as long as they have options***.

Most of what the government does is create one law and force it on everyone, so we never have opportunity to see how other results are coming out for other people, at least not in our country.



> 
> 
> 
> The second problem is how do we decide when laws should be changed,

Let individuals choose which they want to subscribe to and when, let those same laws contain a process for getting rid of them and choosing another law-set.

> and how does one write and propose it. A bill is not just some simple law it has alot of detail and legal speak behind it.

I think it would likely be much like how open-source software works now. Law is basically a legal operating system. Get a bunch of lawyers together and have them produce a cohesive package of law, and sell it to buyers, or give it away and earn fees training lawyers and judges in that system of law or taking a cut of every lawsuit conducted under it.

> 
> 
> 
> But ignoring all that, whatever system we create there will always be the elite, as they will always have control on which direction to go and how the system is set up.

If we walk outside existing jurisdictions, via seasteading for instance, then there's no elite at all and we can build from zero.

The only elite needed are like that group of lawyers to create legal packages for others to consume.

> Also because people want someone to show them the way. 

Sure, but again, it can be voluntarily chosen.

> Why people in China are content with a dictatorship and and having less rights, all because they can live content and not have to care about certain issues.

If they had a choice, they'd likely choose otherwise. Chinese dictatorship persists because it's not so disruptive that they feel the need to get rid of it. The Chinese psychology is that the communist party is annoying but is better than the chaos likely if they tried to get rid of it right now. It's an old society, they understand the need for political stability more than most.

"well sure, depending on what you mean by ""start a charity""

i've been thinking that it's a weakness how when we do projects we try to consolidate all the donations to one place, that's a weak point

so i've been thinking we should organize projects and have people pledge funds to the projects and *keep holding those funds themselves* and then when the project collectively decides to make a purchase *then* call on the people holding the funds to make the necessary payment

pretty sure people would also be more generous in committing funds to such a project lol

so like instead of collecting a bunch of money in a particular wallet and supposedly it's going to go to giving out basic tech to get people onto the internet and hopefully it's not wasted or stolen, instead we just take commitments and then when we have a purchase we can make to get some tech to someone we call on the committed people to realize their commitments ";2;0;False;mungojelly;dtv0ugy;Cointext: Send and receive BCH onchain via SMS.

Let’s exclude not smart phone owners so that’s about 7 Billion people using a cell phone meaning that 1,050,000,000 people would be using iOS.

"**M-Pesa**

M-Pesa (M for mobile, pesa is Swahili for money) is a mobile phone-based money transfer, financing and microfinancing service, launched in 2007 by Vodafone for Safaricom and Vodacom, the largest mobile network operators in Kenya and Tanzania. It has since expanded to Afghanistan, South Africa, India and in 2014 to Romania and in 2015 to Albania. M-Pesa allows users to deposit, withdraw, transfer money and pay for goods and services (Lipa na M-Pesa) easily with a mobile device.

The service allows users to deposit money into an account stored on their cell phones, to send balances using PIN-secured SMS text messages to other users, including sellers of goods and services, and to redeem deposits for regular money.

"**Poe's law**

Poe's law is an adage of Internet culture stating that, without a clear indicator of the author's intent, it is impossible to create a parody of extreme views so obviously exaggerated that it cannot be mistaken by some readers or viewers as a sincere expression of the parodied views.

The original statement of the adage, by Nathan Poe, was:



Without a winking smiley or other blatant display of humor, it is utterly impossible to parody a Creationist in such a way that someone won't mistake for the genuine article.

">&gt;It very likely BCH will be much more resistant to corporate capture because it is the very reason it splitted in the first place.

>How in gods name do you come to that conclusion when you claim that a freakin SUBREDDIT (a freakin subreddit!!!) has the power to change consensus and remove its censorship resistance? 

All major Bitcoin media were own by the same guy.

His decision to apply strong censorship to de-rail the project had absolutely a major effect on the BTC project.

It is media centralisation that has led to major BTC change and ultimately the split.

BCH media are against censorship.

This is not guarantee BCH cannot be captured by corporate interest but it certainly make it harder.

And without crippled block limit, can you explain how a corporation would managed to capture BCH?

(And you are confusing Bitcoin censorship resistance and Bitcoin capture by business interest, this is not the same thing)

>Are you that naive that you think r/btc mods are not corruptible and won't run into the same issue? Come on, you can't be serious. 

Rbtc have open moderation log.

It is enough for me to demonstrate their willingness to remain as transparent as possible.

>You even said yourself that bcash is as c-restistance as any transparent any transparent blockchain, yet you claim bitcoin isn't anymore so what gives?

They both have the same censorship resistance, obviously.

What happened to Bitcoin is corporate interest captured dev and used their influence to prevent any blocksize increase while offering commercial sidechain.

“Create a problem, sell the solution”

>All right dude, Bitcoin wasn't perfect to begin with by the very least. Satoshi didn't have the solution to many issues that came over the years. Neither BCH nor BTC are what BTC was when it was first designed and you know that.

The lower in altcoins you go the more centralized the coin becomes being susceptible to the literal health of the team associated with it.

Well Bitcoin cash is just as censorship resistant as any transparent blockchain.

Miner can collude to orphan a block including your tx.

So both BTC AND BCH are as censorship resistant as mining is decentralised (if mining is decentralised miner cannot collude to orphan a block they don’t like).

**Bitcoin cash** is a split to return to original characteristics, it is not just a fork.

It is, by all objective measures, Bitcoin as it was first designed.

Rbitcoin helped change Bitcoin characteristics and goal against community consensus.

"The Bitcoin sub has very strict rules and if people breach them sooner or later they will be pinged. Discussion is Bitcoin only, not alts not forks. And no posts that are designed to provoke or cause trouble. This was invoked a few years ago to stop the madness that broke out about the XP proposal, lots of threats and bullying which are strictly against Reddit rules. So the forum admin had to do something, people ignored the repeated warnings so then he brought down some strict rules.  Some people call that censorship because it suits their agenda, some people are more moderate and see it as strict moderation. 

These days the Bitcoin sub is largely free from the trouble makers and this is a direct result of the strict rules.

"Question for the Bitcoin Community - As part of my college course I am currently enrolled in a module much of which is centered around the history of bitcoin . I am completely new to the world Bitcoin and still finding my feat in terms of understanding everything so please go easy on my below post in terms of things that may be wrong or dont fit with your views on bitcoin . As part of the course we are currently looking at the difference between bitcoin and bitcoin cash - if you've a few minutes read the below and let me know whats right and wrong and what else I need to know about the split in the community in terms of parties working in both communities , issues and solutions to both parties ideas. 

I appreciate any feedback you could give. 

Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash
August 2017 we saw the creation of a hard fork from Bitcoin’s original blockchain ledger. The fork was created as a result of a debate that caused a split into the bitcoin community. The debate was centered around the issue of scalability in the bitcoin blockchain . The following outlines below what I believe to be the arguments presented by both users of Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash on how best to solve the scalability issue . Open to any corrections of details people may have on either sides arguments . 

The Issue of Scalability.

Under satoshis original whitepaper for Bitcoin we know that individual’s transactions are grouped together to form blocks. Each block has its own blockhash made up of four key components 
1)	The Hash of the previous block 
2)	A time stamp of the new block 
3)	The merkle tree root hash which is the method by which transaction are bundled together from the transaction slush pool  with the first transaction hash in the bunch being the coinbase of that bundle . 
4)	Nonce – This is the puzzle minors need to solve in order to complete the block . To solve the puzzle requires brut computing force so minors must expend computer processing power to find the value randomly that satisfies the puzzle. Upon finding the value the blocks hash is then complete and at this point the block is added to the blockchain .

When a block is added to the blockchain a miner ie the person whos cpu solved the nonce to create the block is rewarded in two ways – 1stly with the issue of newly minted bitcoin  and 2ndly with all the transaction fees that people wishing to send bitcoin transactions to attach to their transactions . 

The issue with scalability surrounding the blockchain prior to August 2017 was that each block could had a maximum blocksize of 1MB which allowed for roughly 250,000 transaction per day to be processed . The issue was that as more and more people began to use the Bitcoin network it began to run slower as users who were unwilling to pay higher fees had to wait longer for their transactions to be added from the slush to a block and confirmed . How to solve this issue of scalability in the blockchain is what ultimately lead to the forking of the blockchain in August 2017 and the creation of Bitcoin Cash .

Bitcoins solution to scalability – 
Bitcoins solution to its scalability issue include the creation of both Segregated Witness ( Segwit ) and lightning protocols. Segwit was introduced to increase the blockchain blocksize from 1mb to a maximum of 4mb with the current protocol allowing for blocks to be 2mbs in size . Segwit also allowed for the creation of layered networks on the bitcoin protocol that will ultimately lead into the adoption of the lightning network . 

The lightening network is a way in which payments can be chained together outside of the blockchain. It works by allowing participants to transactions interact only twice with the blockchain ledger , once to open and once to close a set of transaction . In-between the opening and closing participants enforce digital IOUs against one another with either party having the option to end the current transaction string of IOUs and cash out for the balancing amount . 

Bitcoin Cash’s Solution to scalability . 
Bitcoin Cash creators changed bitcoins protocol such that the block size was increased from 1Mb to 8MB thus allowing for more transactions to be confirmed in each block helping the network to run quicker . 

If you owned Bitcoin prior to August 1st 2017 you also own Bitcoin Cash ( I Think) . Because the chains forked I think so do the public and private key address in the underlying system which means if you sign into a wallet that supports bitcoin cash you’ll find some which at the time I wrote this was roughly 952 USD per coin . Is this correct?

"Because it’s fundamentally dishonest to deceive and defraud people?  

Then again, your dear leader Roger Ver has publicly stated that insider trading isn’t a crime, so it’s not surprising that you would follow the same logic that lying to and manipulating people for personal gain is just peachy keen!  

The fact that the bcash community are holding onto /r/btc or @bitcoin proves you are engaging in deception with the intent to defraud the less informed for your own personal gain.

Here’s a rough analogy (even if it isn’t perfect):

If I walked into a grocery store and purchased a red and white can of soda under a big advertisement for “Cola-Cola”, and then later in the parking lot when I go to open the can and find out they actually sold me something called “Coka-Cola-Soda” would I feel ripped off?  Yes, and so would anyone, because no one likes being manipulated through lies.

Even if I later found out that “Coka-Cola-Soda” was created by a small group of disgruntled ex-“Coka-Cola” employees, it doesn’t justify them highjacking the brand of the company they used to be a part of.  Just because they feel like they are the real original vision for Coka-Cola, it doesn’t make it true, nor does it mean they are entitled to use the brand.    

If you really believed in Bcash, you wouldn’t need to hijack the brand of your competitor, and you wouldn’t need to deceive the public that you are something you aren’t.

It’s in the bcash communities own self interest long term to take responsibility for the fact that you left bitcoin and recognize (even if you don’t like it) that as long as this community continues to pull shit like this, it’s not going to work out the way you want it to.";11;1;False;TylerJStarlock;dtvmt12;To all Core shills saying that BCH hijacked BitCoin brand: BitCoin brand wouldn’t even exist without Jihan, Roger, Gavin and rest of early adopters who are now part of BCH community;7vvmp6;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7vvmp6/to_all_core_shills_saying_that_bch_hijacked/

"**Argumentum ad populum**

In argumentation theory, an argumentum ad populum (Latin for ""argument to the people"") is a fallacious argument that concludes that a proposition must be true because many or most people believe it, often concisely encapsulated as: ""If many believe so, it is so.""

This type of argument is known by several names, including appeal to the masses, appeal to belief, appeal to the majority, appeal to democracy, appeal to popularity, argument by consensus, consensus fallacy, authority of the many, bandwagon fallacy, vox populi, and in Latin as argumentum ad numerum (""appeal to the number""), fickle crowd syndrome, and consensus gentium (""agreement of the clans""). It is also the basis of a number of social phenomena, including communal reinforcement and the bandwagon effect. The Chinese proverb ""three men make a tiger"" concerns the same idea.

"You shouldn't look at the choice of keeping the block size at 1mb as being forced. If anything if we could somehow reduce that number that would be better because now you are making the network less demanding to propagate blocks in under 10 minutes. More nodes=more security and decentralization and going overkill with nodes is a good thing. Now I know BCH is only at 8mb, still small enough for cheap systems to easily propagate blocks, and really that increase is very minor and completely understand the frustration of why not just *temporarily* have it there until we find real solution to handle the enormous amount of transactions coming in the near future. Here's the issue though:
Imagine there never was a fork because they decided that, yes, we could use help with our congestion so lets raise BTC block size to 8mb. Congestion is cleared and the good old days are back. However since BTC never forked, it now has the combined transactions of BTC *and* BCH since BCH (and other forks caused from block size) doesn't exist; Everyone is still using BTC. Eventually though, and very quickly, 8mb blocks would become the new 1mb (I know it would of happened quickly because BCH already has plenty of blocks that were full). Guess what us, the users, are going to say? ""Increase the block size again!""
Eventually we would *have to* stop these increases in risk of lowering the amount of nodes in the network due to blocks becoming more demanding to propagateand giving a false sense that raising block size is the fix. There would be no change even if they did temporary size increases, we just *prolonged* the inevitable, a decision to reduce security and decentralization for the sake of fast and cheap transactions. As much as we hate to admit it, and both sides agree, block size increases are not worth leaving only people that can afford server farms to hold the nodes, Like Craig Wright wants. Even if you did agree with Mr.Wright  and decided to give up decentralization and let them decide what BTC is, Bitcoin would then have vital spots as in these server farms can now be bombed, shut down, hacked or whatever and boom, the death of Bitcoin. Always consider a block size as a defeat because no matter what we will get full again or have server farms. And when you are going to have billions of people transacting *plus* the millions of devices that will be autonomously transacting on their own, expect millions if not billions of transactions happening, per second.

I also wouldn't look at lightning as an alt coin, but more of an alt-chain. This alt chain is what is pegged to the Bitcoin network, the Bitcoin is still Bitcoin. You would then move your bitcoin to this other network to do those instant and virtually free payments. At the moment the bitcoin leave their original network, they are now technically more at risk because lightning, though will be improved and made more secure, could never beat the security of its original network. So anyone receiving these lightning payments are going to want to put those bitcoins *back* to the network and now they are safe and sound. Trust me when I say this hurts me just as much as it hurts everyone else that I can't do these transactions on Bitcoin's much safer and secure network. Still, bitcoin cant do those cool things like nano payments and streaming money without making drastic changes to Bitcoin other than block increases ultimately worsening the security of the network. That's why we need to have second-layer tools pegged to bitcoin's network like lightning.";2;1;False;iiJokerzace;dtwfz0i;To all Core shills saying that BCH hijacked BitCoin brand: BitCoin brand wouldn’t even exist without Jihan, Roger, Gavin and rest of early adopters who are now part of BCH community;7vvmp6;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7vvmp6/to_all_core_shills_saying_that_bch_hijacked/

It's a cheap rhetorical move to call my position an appeal to authority, when in reality Satoshi's original design is simply the superior design. The problem is, as you've demonstrated, you don't actually understand it as Satoshi built it.

Miners are peers. They function as a virtual timestamp server, and by doing so, they disintermediate the need for any trusted third party. The system supports letting users be users.

Satoshi's design was and is still the best plan anyone ever had for a cryptocurrency, and that design is best carried forward on Bitcoin Cash.

"Think of a family tree with the trunk being the original bitcoin that existed up until 2016. With Segwit being introduced into the picture and increased centralization of the blockchain looking imminent, Bitcoin Cash was a fork away from these implementations. BTC as it is today has a mixture of Segwit and non-Segwit addresses and is becoming less like the 2016 Bitcoin every day. Bitcoin Cash is the same technology with no sidechains and no modifications, only an increased block size. Both BTC and BCH are different from what Bitcoin was. BCH is the closest match however and so it is to many people the ""real"" bitcoin. The legacy addresses that existed pre-fork however exist in the BTC chain so it's also perceived by many people as the ""real"" bitcoin. My understanding and support says that BCH *is* Bitcoin and BTC is Segwit Coin. The issue with Segwit is that transactions no longer require the private key signatures to be built into them any longer. This means that if coins ever go into a Segwit address they will forever be lacking in that complete chain of proof of ownership. Sure it's faster and more efficient, but that's because it cuts corners on safety and verifiability. BCH is affordable to use and has made no concessions on security or proof of ownership. So far Segwit works, but everything works right up until it doesn't. The more complex the machine becomes, the more likely it is to fail. This is obviously a touchy subject, but I wanted to do my best to answer your question.";3;1;False;Basschief;dtwgdl1;To all Core shills saying that BCH hijacked BitCoin brand: BitCoin brand wouldn’t even exist without Jihan, Roger, Gavin and rest of early adopters who are now part of BCH community;7vvmp6;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7vvmp6/to_all_core_shills_saying_that_bch_hijacked/

With that being said, I do believe that alt-coins have their place in the ecosystem. If somebody wants to make a BCH-pegged lightning coin, more power to them. It really might be useful for high-frequency payments. The difference is that nobody is being *forced* to use this alt-coin, since on-chain transactions are still viable.

"**Ship of Theseus**

The ship of Theseus, also known as Theseus's paradox, is a thought experiment that raises the question of whether an object that has had all of its components replaced remains fundamentally the same object. The paradox is most notably recorded by Plutarch in Life of Theseus from the late first century. Plutarch asked whether a ship that had been restored by replacing every single wooden part remained the same ship.

The paradox had been discussed by other ancient philosophers such as Heraclitus and Plato prior to Plutarch's writings, and more recently by Thomas Hobbes and John Locke.

"I am a *Bitcoin* supporter, rather than a ""Core"" supporter, but I'll explain a bit:

1) Bitcoin has a lowercase ""c"", not a capital ""C"". When you miscapitalize it, it demonstrates just how little attention you pay to the space. 

2) Bitcoin would exist and be thriving just fine without Gavin, Roger, and Jihan. It would arguably be doing a lot *better* in a number of respects, considering that Gavin doesn't even believe in Bitcoin as a store of value (and has been saying since 2011 that he doesn't personally save in BTC or think that we should strive to make it go up in value), and Roger and Jihan are outright attacking Bitcoin these days and trying their best to discredit it and pump certain altcoins in the process.

3) The moderators of this subreddit ban users and remove posts and comments that they don't like (even if those posts or comments don't violate any subreddit rules) on a regular basis.

That's easily misinterpreted as saying ""whatever that guy picks, I'll follow that.""

You can trust a good developer, but you need to keep the possibility in mind that they slip up, or is railroaded in some way, changes his mind etc. That's why Bitcoin isn't about some core group of developers being in control.

"Bitcoin isn't a corporation, nobody owns the ""brand"", and nobody can criminally misuse the ""brand"". 

""The market"" decides what the Bitcoin ""Brand"" corresponds to. But the term ""the market"" really refers to the consensus status in a culmination of ""all markets"", if that makes sense. 

So /r/btc is ""a market"", and in this particular market, it can be said that the term (and ""branding"" of) Bitcoin refers to BCH. 

But across all markets, that is to say, in ""the market"", the term (and ""branding"" of) Bitcoin still refers to what this sub refers to as ""Bitcoin Core"".

And yes, all of this is confusing. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. It is absolutely useless and counterproductive to make any assumption about deliberate deception, because whether there was any, it was in any case not illegal, which means that it had to happen eventually, which ultimately means that it is something we need to figure out how to address through voluntary, market means.

Although I am very much in favour of using hardforks to take power out of the hands of bad dev teams and steer the development of a cryptocurrency, I'm not a BCH supporter - I'm not against it the idea of it either, I just realise I don't have the technical knowledge to know the best answer to the blocksize problem (which I do recognise is a problem), and I think that if BCH's solution is the best one, then BCH's market cap will continue to grow and ultimately increase to such a point where the chain that is currently understood by the average crypto user to ""be Bitcoin"" (the one most of you here refer to as ""Bitcoin core"") will hardfork yet again, following the exact same specifications as Bitcoin Cash, but with the difference that it will have a majority market consensus this time and therefore the increased-blocksize-chain will be the one with the highest market cap and that which ""the market"" considers to ""be Bitcoin"" - The mere forethought (brought about by market trends) of there being a possibility of everyone trying to sell their BTC for BCH would lead virtually the entire bitcoin community to assent to this new hardfork much faster than it would take for everyone to start trying to sell their BTC for BCH, meaning that the market cap of BCH can ultimately never reach BTC's. But that's just my theory - I might be wrong, and would be interested in hearing counterarguments.

In any case, I am glad that the Bitcoin Cash fork happened this early in the development of Bitcoin (yes, it is still early, in my opinion). Despite not owning any Bitcoin Cash myself, I can think of at least a dozen of different ways you guys are helping the future of Bitcoin, but three of them are : 1) Testing the technical implications of increased blocksize in a measurable way. 2) Providing a measure for the overall market preference for a larger blocksize bitcoin (BCH's market cap) which acts as a dynamic pressure/incentive element on Bitcoin. 3) Giving us an early opportunity to understand and address the (again, ultimately inevitable) marketing dilemma aforementioned.
