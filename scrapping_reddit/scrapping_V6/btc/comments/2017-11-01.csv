"I think the point is if fiat collapses crypto's will gain legitimacy. In 90's in Russia Webmoney risen (similar to Paypal, only registered in Belize and has cryptographical protection beyond SSL (and by the way they used 2FA way before anyone else used it for payments online and they also had arbitrage). You can compare them to eGold, LibertyReserve and Perfect Money. They've risen because they performed one thing government money couldn't ever - protect the value. Everything else - all the infrastructure grew out of this. It was so shady that you would buy WM on the street and sell it on the street on some crazy IT and radio market in Moscow.

When I first heard of Bitcoin I assumed it was that type of company. It didn't help Ripple was widely advertised back then and it **was** that kind of thing. A private company issuing tokens which are *supposed* to be backed by something. That's why I thought it's a fad. Then I started listening and getting memos that it's traded. I thought ""how preposterous!"". An asset which doesn't exist gets traded. Then I saw its rise to $30 and disregarded it ""meh"".

Then 2013 came in. I looked into it and thought ""yeah I don't care I'm just gonna make money on this like some pyramid scheme it is"".

And only then I read the whitepaper when it started going down and I ""lost"" (not really) some money and **HOLY FUCK**. It turned everything upside down in my head. I'm an IT professional. Basic Cryptography is a requirement for my work. Holy shit it dawned on me how easy it was to read for everyone and how easy it was to understand. It is so fucking simple (compare it to Lightning Network WP or any long RFC you'll see what I'm talking about) yet so laconic and to the point that the only thing you think about is ""why no one else even *thought* of this before!?"".

That was about moment I started going crazy due to realisation, also bought some coins with credit card... and paid it off (no financial advice involved, just saying how crazy I was).

**From that moment on I started thinking Bitcoin.**";2;1;False;Ikinoki;dp6kj9t;Satoshi Nakamoto's Brilliant White Paper Turns 9-Years Old;79vdce;https://news.bitcoin.com/satoshi-nakamotos-brilliant-white-paper-turns-9-years-old/

"The tragedy of the commons when it comes to transaction fees being driven down to 0 due to the increase of block size can be mitigated by the miners overtly limiting how low they will go to include any transaction in a block. If a miner wants to include cheap transactions, it would be their choice, while others would want to set a reasonable fee that would be both acceptable by the market and profitable for them.

We had something similar years back when miners stopped accepting 0 fee transactions.

On the other hand, some people might see that as the miners exerting unjust control over the network by limiting which transactions will make it to the blocks.";17;4;False;ThePiachu;dp7mt30;rBitcoin moderator confesses and comes clean that Blockstream is only trying to make a profit by exploiting Bitcoin and pushing users off chain onto sidechains;7a54q7;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7a54q7/rbitcoin_moderator_confesses_and_comes_clean_that/
So true! Current block size limit is tiny. I run a full node and don't care if it's 1 meg or 16 megs. My phone data plan could handle a 1 meg limit. My home connection sees this as background noise..... I agree entirely that there is a point at which block size gets unreasonably large.

"My general stance is that nobody really knows where this is going, so we should be weary of singling out one side of the debate as ""the right one"". Ideally, both would be able to present their case on an equal ground. This way, in case your own judgement is wrong, you're not imposing that error onto others.

That being said, I've seen some projects trying to take advantage of such open forums with astroturfing and vote manipulation. /r/CryptoCurrency has been a target for many pumps and dumps over the years. It's rather hard to say with certainty at times whether there is genuine support for a given idea or post, or is there some manipulation going on. This can go for either or both sides of any important debate really.

All in all, I see the benefit of what Blockstream is trying to achieve - Bitcoin can be a lot more useful with a second layer solution built on top of it, but that doesn't mean we should be neglectful of the on-chain transaction needs.";34;3;False;ThePiachu;dp7ni9z;rBitcoin moderator confesses and comes clean that Blockstream is only trying to make a profit by exploiting Bitcoin and pushing users off chain onto sidechains;7a54q7;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7a54q7/rbitcoin_moderator_confesses_and_comes_clean_that/

"That is a perfectly reasonable interpretation. And as developer myself I have to agree with this approach. The internet is a layered set of protocols. This allows both scaling AND specialization/efficiency. The internet would have never gotten to where it is if every functionality it enables had to be added to a single layer. 

I won't comment on how i feel the BTC development cycle should progress as both sides of the debate  have been argued ad infinitum. But with that in mind, I'm not against increasing the block size in lockstep with the organic growth of the least capable piece of the system. I think it's well agreed at this point that propagation bandwidth is that weakest link. As it grows internationally I hope so too will the block size. 

 I'm bullish on Bitcoin because I believe the quiet, calm, majority is in line with my opinion on this. With block capacity increases like Segwit, 2nd layer solutions both LN and future innovations, and most importantly block size growth tethered to physical system bottlenecks, I think Bitcoin has a bright future indeed. 

And before some raging zealot starts screaming about Core and limiting block size. I don't think 2MB blocks would appreciably harm the network at this very moment. I do however think we should have at least a few hard fork necessary upgrades tested and ready to apply along with the block size upgrade if only to reduce the number of necessary hard forks.

Let me just add one tiny but very important bit: The **only** way that the system is sustainable without inflation long term is **when the miners get properly paid.**

Remember the earlier FUD talk around blocksize? That of ""if you remove the blocksize limit, then tragedy of the commons at very low fees, yaddiyaddayadda!""?

But there is **no** sign whatsoever that the miners will ever go that route.


Now, am I willing to entertain trade-offs in on- vs. off-chain volume for censorship resistance through decentralization?
