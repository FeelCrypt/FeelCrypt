Most of current demand for gold is for [utility](https://www.goldbroker.com/media/image/cms/media/images/global-gold-demand-2019.jpg) purposes, so the comparison with bitcoin breaks just there.  

A more severe fundamental error is in assumption that gold isn't ""consumed"". What's the difference between a copper wire and a gold necklace or bar? There isn't one, in all these cases the metal is still as pure as it was and in an easily reusable form.  
Short of a nuclear reaction, or dumping them in space or in a volcano, elements can't be really ""consumed"". At best they can be dispersed in such a way to make retrieval more expensive than ore extraction, but even for copper that's rare, it's too valuable.  
Everything with platinum in it is very carefully recycled, to the point of extracting platinum from road dust, making his ratio for platinum an obvious absurdity.

Also, ""flow"" is measured by ""number of blocks per month"", which of course is a static number (with slight variance for hash fluctuations). So the chart really isn't saying anything.

"Destroying Bitcoin (and holding back crytpo in general) has been Blockstream's goal from the beginning.

Blockstream simply never makes consistent arguments that hold up to any technical scrutiny.

This is true, but in the preceding years, before the last bull run, the Blockstream co-founders had the enormous advantage of theymos controlling rbitcoin and dictating that no discussion of XT or any block-size increase was even allowed (2014-2016), so most users who advocated for a simple block-size increase via HF were censored or banned outright.  (In case any newcomers are confused by the subs, r/btc started as a refuge for those who could not discuss on-chain scaling on r/bitcoin).  IIUC it is not clear if theymos at some point sold his reddit handle & thus the control/moderation of rbitcoin, but either way, the small blockers had complete control of the main reddit sub, making it easier to manipulate the debate on a broader scale.;24;1;False;sph44;ferzsdj;"Ⓥin Ⓐrmani: ""Blockstream's business model now requires them to shit on Lightning Network, the exact ""solution"" they held up to rationalize breaking BTC in the first place.

"Brings back memories. I was very enthusiastic about the first sidechains paper and occasionally lashed out to critics for being unnecessarily cynical. Then came the concept of ""federated sidechains"" and I was a bit confused. Why push centralized wallets using the name of a decentralizing technology if the tech is possible in the first place? Supposedly this would be a parallel ecosystem development that would *become* decentralized when the actual sidechain tech is developed.

When ""Liquid"" came, many, like you, brought up the obvious conflict of interest. The same people in favor of restricting bandwidth were offering a centralized system they control as an alternative. The standard retort then was ""it is for exchanges, not the end user"". That of course disappeared as we crossed some threshold of collaborative recall and public attention-span.

The game is well played, but I still can't bring myself to believe that this was planned at the time of the sidechains paper. The thought is too chilling and would implicate people I still have some respect for...

"> Were the coins double-spent whenI swept my BTC keys into Electron Cash?

If anything, not double-spent, but unless it was a Schnorr-signed transaction, your transaction _could_ have been _replayed_ on BSV, sweeping those to funds to the same new address on BSV.

That would be strange, given they don't show up in the Electrum SV wallet.

Check the sweeping transaction in Electron Cash. Is it Schnorr-signed (little (S) symbol on transaction detail window)? If so, it cannot have been replayed to SV - so no impact from that sweep and it must be something else.

If I were you, I would try to trace what happened to the original 4 funds on the SV chain, using blockchair.com.

---

Electrum SV and Electron Cash have already diverged quite a bit, I would not expect to copy a wallet from EC to ESV and expect it to just work.

I would always import keys into Electrum SV.

Don't do anything further with Coinomi until you've established what happened on the SV chain.

The thing is that where exchanges and banks are more expensive and fiat currency is more inflationariy, cryptocurrencies are payed at a premium. The result is that it's indeed frequently for free to send money to those countries. Even you can get more value than the official exchange rate from your local currency, some times much more. Yes, I mean your recipient receives more money than what you send. And it's always much faster too. So yes, many times it can be even better than free.

"What reconciliation do you expect is possible?  


I have nothing against BCH as such. What I dislike is the part of the BCH community that through lies, conspiracy theories, and pretending superiority tries to misleading people to stop them from forming their own opinion.  


I have always tried to be honest in my communication, trying to label opinions and opinions.  


I don't see the same behaviour from the most vocal members in r/btc. They tend to label most of their opinions, conspiracy theories, etc as facts.  


I have nothing against people using high-capacity, low fee coins as alternative because transacting on the BTC chain is not worth it for their use case. It's a free world.   


At the same time, I do believe that at some point people will want to keep their money in the currency backed by the most secure PoW chain in the world, and right now that is beyond doubt bitcoin. For this reason, I believe that they'll gravitate to  use 2nd layers and other offchain mechanisms on BTC. After all, if you have BTC, opening an LN channel is \*one\* onchain transaction, and exchanging to BCH is one transaction. I recognize that LN is not mature enough for everyone yet, but for me, it is usable, and it \*is\* seeing increased uptake.

"I would like to add my opinion to the development situation. Development work is very boring especially when there are no problems. In fact, no problems mean quality software development work so boring is good. However, this makes it easy to overlook the importance of such development work. Only when there is a critical bug happening on this multi-billion dollars p2p cash system, that people suddenly woke up to its importance. It is like the Internet, because it works so well in the background, and only when it breaks (and all websites became inaccessible along with it), people start to realize what a big role it played.

Based on my research, (bear in mind I changed all my BTC to BCH on the 3rd day of the fork), BCH was only possible because of ABC's talented developers. I have read the history. BU have tried and tried and failed. This type of track record speaks for itself.

>Ripple relies on **a common shared ledger,** which is **a distributed database** storing information about all Ripple accounts.

Those servers (especially trusted validators) are run almost exclusively by banks and the ripple company itself.

TIL a 419 scam is the Nigerian Prince scam! From wikipedia, 'The number ""419"" refers to the section of the Nigerian Criminal Code dealing with fraud, the charges and penalties for offenders.'

And this sounds relevant: ""An **advance-fee scam** is a form of [fraud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud) and one of the most common types of [confidence tricks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_tricks). The scam typically involves promising the victim a significant share of a large sum of money, in return for a small up-front payment, which the fraudster requires in order to obtain the large sum. If a victim makes the payment, the fraudster either invents a series of further fees for the victim or simply disappears.

"Just a notice to people who might not be entirely engrossed in this case, and may be liable to be confused:

The bonded courier is a complete lie. It didn't deliver public keys, or private keys, nor did it even exist. However, Craig is piling lies on top of other lies to fool different audiences.

1. For most of 2019, he claimed he was going to receive the keys to his vast fortune in January 2020 by a bonded courier. You know, just like that Nigerian prince you've heard so much about.
2. On December 27th, he changed his tale and [published an article](https://coingeek.com/craig-wright-sets-record-straight-again-on-tulip-trust/), claiming to set the ""record straight again"", and that ""I have not said the private keys to those coins would become available"". This is a bald faced lie contradicted by his own sworn declaration in court.
3. As part of an organized pump, Craig has confidently declared ""I have the keys"", leaving it to [lower level cult members to shout](https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoincashSV/comments/eosc5v/craig_delivered_the_tulip_trust_key_slice/) from the hill tops that he has the **private** keys. Figures closer to the top like Calvin, Craig, and their [propaganda ministers](https://mobile.twitter.com/justicemate/status/1216546212091838464) have deliberately stayed coy and not clarified one way or another whether Craig claims to have the private or public keys, while their astroturfers are allowed to say whatever [lies](https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoincashSV/comments/epym8u/craig_wright_moved_money_out_of_tulip_trust/) needed to [pump](https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoincashSV/comments/eq6icd/urgent_the_time_has_come_2010_bch_coins_just/) [BSV](https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoincashSV/comments/epls2v/court_document_of_tulip_trust_key_vs_fake_cryto/feksy22/).

As the bonded courier claim starts to unravel in court, Craig will be forced to state that he does not have the private keys and only has the public keys. His shill army will then act like that was obvious and honest Craig would never hope to mislead anybody otherwise.

"I bring this up every so often in relation to cold storage wealth.  A service that sends an email seems unnecessary to me when I already have a service handling things should I disappear: my attorney.  If I had a dead man's service, I'd want them to provide crypto expertise since my attorney/family may not understand.  [My previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/a8gy5a/dont_be_this_wife_cryptocurrencyeducation/ecatque/).  Pasted:

You put your savings into 3 of 5 multisig where:

Key 1 = owner. This is not shared and is lost when the owner dies.    
Key 2 = owner dead man’s key. This is in a safe place, like a safe deposit box, and is retrieved when the owner dies as part of the estate.    
Key 3 = power of attorney. Whomever is appointed power of attorney and/or executor is supplied their own key.    
Key 4 = the dead man’s service.    
Key 5 = owner revocation.  This is not shared and is lost when the owner dies. 

The will should indicate that the dead man’s service will assist the power of attorney or executor with crypto and surrender the funds to them as part of the estate. 

That means:

* if the owner changes their mind, keys 1, 2, and 5 are known to the owner and can move the funds. 
* keys 1 and 5 are lost upon death, so the executor contacts the service as outlined in the will. Keys 2, 3, and 4 are then assembled to move the funds. 
* the service and/or executor are unable to defraud the owner because not enough keys are known (1, 2, and 5 are inaccessible and known only to the owner). Keys 3 and 4 are not enough to unlock the funds. 

The owner may then rest easy (dead or alive) knowing the savings are safe while alive and a crypto expert service is assisting the executor after death.";7;2;False;vswr;feoq19z;Plan for your keys after death - Dead man's switch;eq6sbl;https://absentplan.com

"Yeah I'm sure, it's the nature of computing that you don't get unlimited throughput on anything for a set amount of resources. The best you get is effectively unlimited where the number is so high it will never be practically reached. But when you're talking about literally every single transaction taking place across an already enormous complicated civilisation and with rapidly expanding size and complexity, that number itself is almost effectively unlimited.

This is not fatal though. Whatever that limit ends up being, it's extremely high and it will only get higher over time, and non-broadcast mediums on top *then* can offer effectively unlimited scope for scale, underpinned by the massive value and stability of a proper extremely widely deployed and detailed peer to peer electronic cash as the base layer rather than a falsely limited sabotaged one with such a necessarily low volume that second layer traffic will always relegate it into abject irrelevance.

"That's an interesting idea but I can see a couple flaws with it right up front;

1) Any such vehicle instantly becomes a target for those that would want to invalidate that goal, and in fact simply establishing something to masquerade *as* that but operated by those exact people is both an obvious move, and something that has already been done (see blockstream and /u/nullc brigade; we must stop using bitcoin to keep bitcoin decentralised)

2) That basically *is* what BCH is for those of us who have been here all along and knew what it would take to get where Bitcoin actually wanted to go. It stands as the most successful organisation coalesced around those ideas thus far. It's not immortal, but consider the game theory if it fell. Those of us still around would simply go to whatever is next on the list, we're not going to give up just because one org failed, we've been here for too long and we know as long as we keep trying we'll succeed, and so that's what we do.

3) You're protecting a group of people who are so utterly clueless and blind on the subject that your defense of their interests will never really be visible to them, so they'd never actually invest in it in significant amounts, even though it's existential to them. They are in fact so stupid that thus far historically it has been easier to enlist them on the attackers side than the defenders side, just look at the massive horde of clueless followers that Blockstream and their cronies managed to accrue on their completely witless plan.

On a broad scale the human race as a whole assumes that this is what the state is for, when the exact opposite is actually closer to the truth. They seem to be impossible to dissuade from this notion no matter how much evidence becomes available. Given all of the above, it's hard to say for certain that at the end of the day an actual promise of cheap, fast, uncensorable transactions *will* turn out in their interests, because at a certain point those pursuing that agenda might decide what suits the interests of that broader general populace is either irrelevant to or directly opposed to their own interests, and since it's they who have their hands directly on the steering wheel, it is they who will influence the direction the vehicle steers.";2;0;False;etherael;fetnhps;The economics of BTC's artificial price ceiling (BCH unaffected);eq681y;http://breakingsatoshi.com/2020/01/17/btc-price-cap/

"I agree. I watch fork.lol regularly and it would be quite rare to see BCH step over 4 or 5% relative hash. **However, OP is correct**, the [fork.lol chart (2nd graph)](https://fork.lol/pow/hashrate) shows a nice surge that nearly touched 9% (9/17@11:28). That 9% peak is too small to influence the method of running averages you listed (read the disclaimer).

If you look at the relative hashrate graph, note the change in appearance; the peaks may be roughly the same historical height, but the valleys have changed from U-shaped to V-shaped, meaning the hash power continues to ebb, but it returns quickly.

This has resulted in a **more consistent +4% profitability for BCH**. BCH now has longer, consistent runs of +2 to +5%. BTC still hits back with brief bursts of 10 to 16%, but the consistent profitability for BCH could make it appealing for miners to leave their hash power pointed at BCH.

"The article in the photo,  ""Chancellor on brink of...""  is embedded in the earliest blocks of the BTC chain.  Many people are trying to say this is certain evidence of Satoshi's war on global banks.   Though Satoshi talked of a future where he envisioned decentralized electronic currency working, he never stated that his goal was to revolutionize the global economy with bitcoin.   He gave the reason why this headline was embedded.  To prove that the block couldn't have been created before that date.   That means he chose the headline out of whatever was available that day.   This was the most economic related one.

People theorize that this indicates his philosophy for creating the coin, but then entirely ignore that he called the first block genesis and waited 6 days to mine the next block.  He was probably just being an engineer and thinking these easter eggs were clever.

"BTC is still the best coin for transactions of $100 to $10k that must settle on next block or for much larger transactions you can settle within a day, somewhere around $1M.

BCH is better for 1 cent up to about $500 that must settle next block. You can get to about $50k within a day and anything above that would be risky.

LN was marketed for the lower range of BCH usability. It is possible that some decided to give up on BTC and switched, but those who realized LN wasn't practical probably switched already. Those left might be so entrenched they will never switch. In other words, it won't change much.

What might change is the $100-$500 range. If you typically interact with the lower value market, you would switch to BCH because that market is steadily moving out of BTC.

Nobody is going to do that. They need it to be converted into fiat immediately. These people are running businesses, not dicking around for an hour selling their single BCH payment.

[Local.bitcoin.com](https://Local.bitcoin.com) is a money-making opportunity and merchants are smart. Some of them want to learn new things. Some of them are even quite grateful for the opportunity to access ""the internals"" of the system.

p2sh also enables unique value for use cases. I have read your specific opposition to it although you supported it in the past. What is different between these? Why have a strong opinion about p2sh and not about also removing these other op codes that interfere with ""Satoshi's Vision""?

"I have never met anyone involved in this project and have very few BCH which I have already 100% written off.

And I dont want to defend anyone or anything I know nothing about. 

As a casual observer in this space, it seems to me  Roger with his honest enthusiasm to promote bitcoin Cash  is a massive asset for the BCH chain. Maybe he is a big investor as well, but I am sure there are other big investors who pay nothing to fund development or promotion. I can imagine if you wanted to hire Roger to promote a chain it would cost a vast amount. maybe his work is underestimated or overlooked because he is a big investor? 

Sales and Promotions are a space where truth can have a variety of meaning, I can point to the apple/jobs example of ""reality distortion field"" and those skills may often color discussions in other areas, especially with self promotion. Have you never embellished your CV or otherwise spoken more highly of yourself than other might agree with?

The project itself doesnt appear structured, how did SN envisage payments for developers? maybe SN needs to be called out for his lack of vision funding protocol development.

in terms of increasing revenues, the more the chain is used, the higher the adoption, should lead to a higher price of BCH and hopefully that would lead to more money for developers. So developers need to listen to promoters/sales because its the promoters who know what features are needed by the users to increase the price.

It's not black and white and depends on what point you gave up. I saw the writing on the wall the moment they decided to do SegWit first and blocksize later.

Maybe you disagree that it was engineered but the result is the same. Go try my experiment and see. The entire debate started because the community wanted to increase the BTC max block size but blockstream wanted to keep it limited. Now everyone wants to keep it limited.

Well that's how it started, but after the extremely effective social engineering campaign many people here, maybe even a majority here cheer for the downfall of what they once loved. r/btc now acts directly in unison with Blockstream to ensure that Bitcoin never receives the block size upgrade it so desperately requires. If you don't believe me, just try making a post here suggesting that the blocksize be raised on the BTC chain - you'll be met with an even more hostile response than on r/bitcoin.
