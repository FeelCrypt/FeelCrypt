You see transactions. Those can be verified and correlated with other transactions you know he made so you know it was his address. Nobody knows if his private key was compromised. The FBI was after him for some time. You can't know if they or somebody else hacked his PC (we know they hacked the servers) and took his key to make some transactions and have proof. Besides you can not verify the logs. Thus you have no way to know what those payments have been for, IF he made them by himself. Anything digital I consider not proof enough to charge someone x years in prison. It's to easy to fake such 'proofs' and there are dozens of reasons why the FBI as an institution or people working for the FBI would fake evidence. We know that multiple of the FBI personal in charge of the operation have dirt on their shoulders and are in fact in prison now. Why would anyone believe any evidence they came up with? In any democratic country Ross would either be free by now because he has broken no law or because there have been MAJOR issues with the process and evidence OR he'd get a rather mild sentence (5-10 years) for e.g. providing a platform without any regulation (which is a crime in most modern countries). But 2x life sentence? Saying he's responsible for deaths of children? That's a fucking joke and anyone who doesn't see that this was staged must be nuts.;9;0;False;masixx;e2fp6lr;Sign the Petition for Clemency for Ross Ulbricht, Serving Double Life for a Website;8yu0m8;https://www.change.org/p/president-of-the-united-states-clemency-for-ross-ulbricht-serving-double-life-for-a-website

Also funny how people want to hold up the court as proof of innocence when something is dismissed but when Ross was convicted they immediately called BS.

I agree with most of what you said, but this one is naive on your part. Big pharma and their cronies in congress are to blame for the opioid crisis.

Then you should advocate charging executives of the pharmaceutical industry with crimes against humanity, because they are what is really fueling the opioid crisis. If people had access to safe plant based medicines, they wouldn't need opioids to deal with their pain. This whole system is set up to keep the actual unpatentable medicines away from the people who need them most in order to keep them hooked on patentable pharmaceutical drugs.

"Sure, buy bad drugs, risk dying. The benefit of silkroad compared to the normal process of buying drugs is that there's less risk involved. Buyer reviews the seller based on quality of the product and other factors. Users would often have their drugs purity tested and report back in the form of a review. 


You never get this with a in-person drug deal and thus the risks are much greater. The highest selling drugs on silk road were weed and purity-tested psychedelics, whereas in street deals the dealer usually tries to get people into more addictive and deadly drugs like meth and heroin, which again shows another benefit of online platforms such as silk road.
