"> for no goddamn reason

It's not for no reason. A big reason that Bitcoin is so revolutionary is that there is no central authority that controls it -- no banks or corporations or state-run agencies can manipulate it, unless they attack the network itself.

Increasing the block size would increase mining difficulty (because mining involves a ton of hashing, and hashing larger amounts of data takes more power). This would mean that the people with the more expensive hardware (and more of it) will ""win"" more and more often. This would likely lead to several large mining operations instead of a distributed army of miners, thus centralizing the currency and reducing the security of the network.";0;1;False;S0rghum;dma7x5m;A glimpse into the future;6wpdei;https://i.redd.it/7dvqdd5lbmiz.jpg

"> thanks for the socialism 101 

Pretty much all developed countries have universal healthcare or some analog. Are they socialist countries? They have robust market-based economies. 

> Why don't we do this for everything?

For a number of reasons:

1. Healthcare research is a [public good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good).
2. Healthcare is associated with a number of [market failures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_failure), and thus using free market approach is not efficient
3. Nationwide health is a public good, having people around you healthy is good for you
4. Sickness is random, so you want to put money into pool instead of paying directly. So why not make just one big pool?

In more detail:

`1.` I think it's pretty obvious. It might take a lot of effort, billions of dollars, to find a cure for a disease. Once it's done, it can be replicated. Currently government grants a company a temporary monopoly to produce a certain drug. Without that government monopoly you'd have very little investment into research, so you can only supplant that with public financing of research.

`2.` Your doctor is not your friend. If he is rational (as an economic actor), he is looking to optimize his profit, not your health. So he is not interested in curing you. He is interested to keep you alive to get as much money as possible from you. This is known as a [principal-agent problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal%E2%80%93agent_problem).

But why is this possible? [Information asymmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_asymmetry). Doctor knows his shit, he spent years learning and practicing. You don't. So you don't know if his treatment is good or not. Healthcare is probably the most obscure good in terms of information asymmetry as it's extremely complex and inherently probabilistic.

Another problem is that care is often needed urgently. When you have a problem, you don't have time to shop around.

`3.` People around you affect your health. If they are sick, you might get sick too. So you want everyone to be healthy. You want people to have herd immunity. Also sick people are less productive, they are less happy, etc. So you benefit from other people being healthy. So if everybody benefits from it, everybody should chip in and pay for it.

`4.` You want insurance anyway, so you put money into a large pool, so why not just make one large pool for everyone and also finance research? Does this make too much sense?

As I mentioned, pretty much all countries got that, and they got great healthcare. You can dig up stats, there is a tremendous improvement in life expectancy.

You need to be a very ignorant and mean person to deny these basic facts.

Now back to your question:

> Why don't we do this for everything?

Other things are not like healthcare. People have different preferences. And goods they consume have nothing to do with public goods.

So it just makes sense to let the market to handle this, to try different options, etc.

> I'll give you a hint though, it's been tried before.

Yeah, it's been tried, and it works fine, for a long time. [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_health_care#/media/File:Universal_health_care.svg) in green you have countries with universal health care. Very few of them are communist countries. (ironically, China, a communist country, doesn't have universal health care.)

So universal healthcare has very little to do with communism. You've been brainwashed. Capitalist countries like UK, France, Germany do that with great success. Communist China doesn't do that.

> Congrats. You've used better logic than the vast majority of people.

What's so sacred about private property? It seems like it's something you worship.

> Once you answer the question above, you'll understand what the problem is.

"WTF is pretzellike about this? He thinks the reason he has to wait for his elective procedure is because of Medicare. He thinks if he didn't pay his medicare levy (which is 2% of your income, by the way) he could afford to pay for his procedure, cash. I'm saying I think he's wrong about that.

Of course, he may be on a salary of $250,000, which means his medicare levy is $5000, plus he's rich enough to have to pay a medicare surcharge of a further 1.5%. So his total ""healthcare tax bill"" is $8750. A year.

If he's single, he'd be better off buying private health care because doing so means he doesn't have to pay the medicare levy surcharge (saving $3750). Bit if he has a wife and kids, he'll get a shitload of tax breaks and family tax benefits and whatnot.

Yes, private insurance gives you access to private hospitals and lets you get stuff like knee reconstruction and various other surgeries the government - somewhat arbitrarily at times - deems non essential. 

But even if he pays for private health care, HE STILL GETS THE GOVERNMENT HEALTH CARE if he needs it!

If he's out on the town drunk, and loses his ID, and gets run over and taken to hospital and put back together... there's no QUESTION of problems with ""the bill"" because all the emergency care is taken care of by the government, and once someone finds him and contacts his private health provider, he can get a private room or demand a particular surgeon etc.

The TLDR of this is that, in Australia, to be in a situation where the government is MAKING you pay US-levels of health insurance (something over $3500 a year for individuals, on average, I believe? Which doesn't give you blanket coverage by ANY means) via tax, you have to be rich as shit. $3500 is 2% of $175,000!!

And the BIG difference is that when you need medical care in Australia, if what you have is trying to kill you, you just get the care. No questions. No ""limits"". You just get to fight the cancer or the parasite as a human being, not as an underwriter's liability.

The differences in Australian and US healthcare aren't just that the government will pay to save our lives and splint our ankles and scoop our brains back into our skulls. It's that for the price of 2% of your income, you get the change to ""beat this thing"" without worrying that your course of treatment is only covered for 9 months, or you will be refused a payout because you had an infected ingrown toenail one time etc etc.

If you are a normal person's salary of like, $60,000 and you think $1200 is too much to pay to know that you will never be kicked into the street with a packet of aspirin and an insincere ""good luck""... well you're just stupid.

(Houses are very expensive though, no argument there.)

As for ""queue jumping,"" the private health care system here is a  separate queue, you ain't jumping shit. The point of universal healthcare is that so when life dumps on you unexpectedly, you don't get left to die.

I walked out without paying a cent, and the government gave that doc something like $30, $40 for the five minutes of her time my 'procedure' took.

What would that have cost in the US? Cost of ""consult"". Cost of ""instrument retrieval"". Cost of ""sterilisation and preparation"" (even though it was already sterilised). Cost of ""disposal of biowaste"" (the gross earbud tip with my wax on it). Etc etc etc. A couple of hundred bucks?

"Well, a society consists of people. 

When you see it as a pure game theoretic way without regard for morals, it's just more efficient to kill rich people and seize their assets.

And rich people cannot hire guards. Because, guess what if guards can cooperate, a better payoff for them is to kill the rich person and seize his assets than to receive salary. (If you receive salary you receive 5% of his wealth over time. If you kill him, you get 100%. Which is more profitable, usually.)

So a society cannot function without morals, we basically have prisoner's dilemma where nothing gets built and people fight for resources.

So we gotta have morals, like we do not kill, we do not steal, we help people who are in need.

If you think about it, morals in modern days are usually based on empathy which is roughly connected to Kant's Categorical Imperative (i.e. if you see a person in a bad situation you might imagine how it would feel like if you was him, and you want the society to help him because you or your loved ones might end up in the bad situation next time).

"Let's consider an example. Suppose you live in a village where there is no money, no government, no taxes or anything. The entire world is just a single village with 100 people in it, and you live off agriculture.

When somebody gets sick, he gets no healthcare and dies. That's not cool.

So people think like ""We have surplus of beets and potatoes, but we are not happy because we get sick. Maybe we can get a doctor somehow?"".

So one guy volunteers to be a doctor. He needs some time to acquire doctor skill. But he is concerned that he might starve. So he says: ""I'll be a doctor and heal you guys, but if you agree to share your produce with me, like 1% of produce"".

So if you grow 100 kg potatoes, you give 1 kg to a doctor. Even you are not sick.

Now suppose everyone agrees to this scheme, except one guy, let's call him relemhcs. He doesn't want to share. So people say: ""Hey relemhcs, don't be a dick. We decided we all gotta share with doctor. If you don't share, others might think it's optional too, and doctor will starve, and we won't have our free healthcare. You know, if you want to be a selfish dick, we will just take your produce whether you want it or not"".

I see where you're coming from: it might be considered immoral to take private property from a person.

But a morality of the whole village is that healthcare is provided and that people share. So it's not immoral if you consider it this way.

That for 99% of working adults (who pay for the system), the worry and stresses of healthcare vanish. We don't have to worry about unexpected medical bills, or trips to the doctors. We don't have to worry about our insurance premiums or deductibles. 

Even if the actual bill per capita was higher (which it isn't it is almost half the US cost) it would be a price worth paying.

No one should ever have to worry about their life being ruined, or hell even their month due to an unexpected medical event or simple accident.  

Hell the only thing in my life that has the potential to hit me with an unexpected bill that might hurt me financially is my car (mechanical failure - it's insured for everything else) everything else is insured.

As a country, you pay a bigger proportion of your GDP per capita in healthcare costs than Australia does, and you get worse healthcare (with the exception of certain parts of your country that have the best and most advanced hospitals in the world).

This problem, of paying too much for healthcare, has been a feature of US society for a number of decades.";1;1;False;;dma069i;A glimpse into the future;6wpdei;https://i.redd.it/7dvqdd5lbmiz.jpg

"> USSR-style state capitalism

lol

>But you can have a free market - where people produce goods and services for profit - without capitalism

Sure.  I just don't think productivity will be anywhere close to what it needs to be to meet the demands of society at large, since one has an upper ceiling on how much of their labor they can convert into property that society will honor as ""theirs.""  Added to that, people wouldn't be equal in such a society - some would produce more and get more, and there's nothing implied in your description that people who produce nothing would get anything at all - so there'd still be homeless people, there's still be a lack of funding for the mentally ill, etc.

Unless you DO support some kind of system of social welfare, which would require a coercive entity functionally equivalent to the state.  And then, at that point, welfare capitalism pretty much offers the same thing, just MORE prosperity, created via MORE productivity, and the social welfare systems would have a bigger pot of wealth to draw off of.

Not my point though it's not like anybody who gets in debt suddenly opts for bankruptcy. Debt is the catalyst for crime, for drugs, for people  working 3 minimum wages jobs. All this creates workers for some company in the end doing some mind numbing task for a pittance.

"Okay.

If your country utilizes price controls on medicine, pharmaceuticals, and biotechnology (and pretty much every country that has a tax-funded healthcare system does), then it is not paying the fair market price of those goods.  The company selling those goods can take one of two courses:

1. It can resign itself to lower (or, in most of these cases, almost non-existent) profits, which doesn't help the company weather uncertain negative future economic circumstances (like that flood in Thailand that fucked the factory that supplied motors for hard drives), expand, and/or put money into future products.

2. They can shift those lost profits to a market that they know *will* pay for them - such as a third-party insurer in a country that has them.  Which means America.

Consumers have no stake in this, because hey, it's not their money (past their deductible).  They don't shop around for a provider/reseller who provides them with good value, because they can't - they're trapped in their network, and they have no incentive to help the insurers shop around... so prices are ballooning out of control.  

That also ignores U.S. military subsidization of almost every country with public healthcare.  They pay a fraction of what their actual defense needs are, freeing some of their budget to be spent on social services.  We don't have that luxury, since we're paying the bulk of everyone's defense bill.

One of the pros of a universal healthcare system in the United States is that foreign governments would no longer enjoy the power disparity that they now enjoy when negotiating against a foreign private company - they'd be negotiating against the U.S. government, which would be considerably less keen on letting the bilking of it's taxpayers continue, and would likely demand higher payments from foreign governments for U.S. medical I.P.";2;2;False;the_calibre_cat;dmajfyw;A glimpse into the future;6wpdei;https://i.redd.it/7dvqdd5lbmiz.jpg

"> The difference is that a megacorp or person can't rise in wealth exponentially by just already being rich, buy tons of land and a private army, and become a state in all but name.

First off, I reject the notion that people of wealth can become anything functionally resembling a state, especially in the context of an actual state.  Today's rich are not states.  They cannot coerce you into certain behavior by threatening your life, they cannot incarcerate you, etc.  Only the state can do that.

Secondly, people being rich just doesn't bother me whatsoever.  It doesn't hurt me, and frankly, given the results of free market capitalism versus the historic attempts at realizing socialism, it's arguably beneficial for me.

>Even without such an extreme example, capitalism allows some people to gain power over others...

I don't think this is a problem that can meaningfully be addressed.  Attempts at realizing socialism simply replaced the class of people who had power over others, and the usual socialist retort of ""Well it wasn't REAL socialism then"" just falls on deaf ears.  No one should take that argument seriously, because NO actualization of ANY political ideology has EVER perfectly mirrored the on-paper version.

The people who tried to realize socialism were well-versed in Marx's writings, knew what the goals were, and STILL happened to create an immensely privileged political upper class, whose offspring had access and opportunities that the rest of the population lacked, and had prioritized access to resources like housing, food, consumer goods, etc.

Like, obviously that's not what you guys are after, but the going solution seems to be ""just trust us that won't happen THIS time"" (""this time"" being, like, *the 13th time*).  That doesn't even get into the openly hostile rhetoric that, at least SOME of your members employ.  How DO I trust that whatever you design will be ACTUALLY democratic?

> I think preventing that is worth a reduction in total GDP.

I don't.  I think we've designed an imperfect system, but a good system which encourages and allows the pursuit of one's dreams like nothing the world has ever seen before, and i think the system you propose would dampen that, frankly.  At the very least, what we have now *isn't* the ""sky is falling"" catastrophe it's made out to be, and there's no certainty that the proposed replacement will be as much of a slam-dunk as its advocates claim.  It is absolutely reasonable to harbor skepticism to the idea.

>though I am already wondering how apples-to-apples this can be, given that black people weren't.

That's a fair point that's often brought up. I would argue that since I'm arguing about the private market's healthcare and it was the government that didn't recognize the rights of blacks and women, that it's not relevant. At least not as relevant as if we were comparing aspects of the government.

I can even find you some arguments that since there were many of these ""mutual-aid societies"" that existed and the majority of them actually existed to help minorities due to government discrimination, that healthcare for minorities was actually better for then.

>And the population was just 100 million.

Also a fair point, but I again argue that this is only an issue when arguing for government-supported healthcare, since the funds come from a single source, the government. For private markets, an increase in population just results in an increase in demand and therefore an increase in supply. For instance, it is no harder to find access to groceries since the population has tripled, in fact I'd argue that it is easier.

Lastly, thank you for being open-minded to arguments that are new to here.

When all costs are input, welfare is cheaper than letting a destitute underclass build up in the alleys until they march on the Bastille and chop everyone's head off.

No, it's worse for everyone, because people should have access to healthcare regardless of their employment situation. You're moving the burden of payment from the taxpayer to the corporations, making it harder for small time businesses to employ people as they have to provide insurance. There is no advantage in the employer paying for their employee's healthcare.

No, they don't. The ""best possible treatment"" is one where the most people get treatment and live. If you're rich and you live in an industrialized country, you can get the best possible treatment. In the few cases where there are actual exceptions, as a rich person you can go to another country and get the treatment there, 'cause you're rich.

You're rehashing the same old tired arguments. The American system is inferior to the one in the EU because it costs more, helps fewer people, stifles growth and benefits only the insurance companies.

"Im a lawyer that sues doctors and my father and brother are doctors in private practice. Doctors do not conspire to increase the costs for people not on insurance. In fact, most (90%) private physicians do not treat uninsured people because they would rather get paid than try to collect on people who may not be able to pay.

The only entity that could arguably be said to conspire is hospitals but that isnt so much a conspiracy as an economic reality. Hospitals have to treat everyone who goes there. They cannot turn people away. This means that they serve a large portion of the population who have no insurance and who cannot pay. They need to make this money up somehow so they end up increasing their bills to people who can pay. This is why an MRI at a hospital costs 3.5k but at a private facility costs under 1k.

The only way to fix this balance is to permit hospitals to turn away people who cannot pay. This would essentially be permitting hospitals to allow poor sick people die on the streets.

I guess you've never been poor. I'm in my phone and about to pass out so I'm just going to give a few quick brief examples. Bank accounts. If you're so poor that your funds are negative, you are charged an overdrawn fee by most banks for each time it happens. Also, if you have less than a given amount in your balance, they charge you a fee for having an account. You're punished twice for being poor. Okay what about legal troubles? Let's say you get a speeding ticket you can't afford. Courts don't give a fuck so they just give you probation instead. You don't have to  pay the ticket but now you're on probation for a year and have to pay monthly probation fees. Any mishap whatsoever legally and it'll be a violation of probation and you're thrown in jail. Good luck keeping any job. I could provide more examples but I'm going to sleep. I find it heartbreaking really that you'd consider welfare an exploit. There are a lot of things that keep poor people poor.

Without sufficient testing, you could break the consensus rules, and have unexpected network fragmentation.  On the other hand, deliberate network fragmentation / hard forking also has its issues.  There's also questions about whether overly large blocks will lead to centralization of control (due to the expense), and if so, where exactly the sweet spot is between these conflicting constraints.

Segwit was a tentative step towards fixing this (and a BUNCH of other things). Even this step was done slowly, because rushing headlong into changes is how you break things, and a core part of a cryptocurrency network's value is its long term reliability. 

Other currencies and forks have been rolling out segwit & block expansions of their own.  This lets them absorb the risk, while bitcoin holds off and absorbs the reward by adopting changes at a slower pace, after they've garnered ""real world"" testing.

I wouldn't be surprised if BTC eventually does alter the block size; but there are many other options besides just doubling it, requiring more study first.

"> For a number of reasons:

Yeah, I told you to not attempt to come up with arbitrary distinctions. Literally none of those things have any bearing on why it's not treated the same. There are plenty of things which are more important for the public's well-being, have more r&d and funding requirements, and information asymmetry.

>2. Your doctor is not your friend. If he is rational (as an economic actor), he is looking to optimize his profit, not your health. So he is not interested in curing you. He is interested to keep you alive to get as much money as possible from you. This is known as a principal-agent problem.

The principal-agent problem in medicine has to do with failure in insurance markets which are a result of government intervention as I've previously noted. With enough competition, insurance companies would be incentived to offer the best care to keep you healthy to decrease costs. This is how insurance used to function in the U.S., they would cover things like gyms, spas, preventative care, etc all to prevent more costly issues down the road.

Now that government funded insurance and healthcare is the majority of the industry (has been for a decade or two), they have created the principal-agent problem. Insurance companies are incentivized to increase costs and pay for extraneous shit with inflated prices, because it just results in more payout from the feds. You are literally arguing for the problem you think you're arguing against.

So again, you spent a lot of effort either typing things which are not relevant to the question or actually discredit your argument. I would ask the question again but I know you will just try to deflect.

The reason we don't socialize everything is because without calculation, economic activity is impossible. Since under Socialism economic calculation is impossible, under Socialism there can be no economic activity in our sense of the word â€¦ All economic change, therefore, would involve operations the value of which could neither be predicted beforehand nor ascertained after they had taken place. Everything would be a leap in the dark. Socialism is the renunciation of rational economy.

Socialization of industries like food has resulted in the mass starvation of millions of people. What you advocate literally kills people.

And you think *this* is the best way to run the healthcare industry.

>Yeah, it's been tried, and it works fine, for a long time. Here in green you have countries with universal health care. Very few of them are communist countries. (ironically, China, a communist country, doesn't have universal health care.) So universal healthcare has very little to do with communism. You've been brainwashed. Capitalist countries like UK, France, Germany do that with great success. Communist China doesn't do that.

I really don't care about your communist vs socialist debate you're having with yourself. It's pointless. It's semantics. Communism is supposed to be this imaginary post-scarcity stateless socialist society. Post-scarcity will never exist and you can't have socialism without a state, so it's literally impossible. Anytime you hear ""communism"" it means ""socialism"". They're interchangable. They're one in the same.

And yes, universal healthcare is socialism. Lol, I can't even believe this is an argument. Socialism fundamentally means government controlled industry. UHC = government controlled healthcare, so yes UHC = socialism. *facepalm*

>What's so sacred about private property? It seems like it's something you worship.

Jesus Christ. Private property is literally your life. Without respect for private property literally mean without respect for your person and everything created by it.

>It's essentially same as a compulsory insurance, math works out, it all works.

What?? No it isn't although that is also a terrible idea. UHC is *government provided healthcare*, are you really this stupid?

I can go anytime to any doctor and tell him I have an emergency and he will tell me to wait until he has some time for me depending on my emergency. Or I can just go to any emergency room and get treated there.

"> Not an accurate comparison.

On the contrary, it *is* an accurate comparison. The reason why you don't see competition in healthcare in the US is largely due to regulatory constraints on the supply of doctors and hospitals.

> The problem is not solved by deregulation because consumers don't have much choice.

I just explained how it absolutely is.

> You can't really choose what hospital you go to in an emergency situation.

Yes, you absolutely could in the case of hospitals being free to start up wherever they wanted and a network that is pre-selected.

> Also, you don't have much choice in what drugs are administered.

You'd have more choices if not for IP laws. Again, regulation.

> Theoretically, dropping the patent laws could help with competition, but the issue is that this decentivizes innovation and development of drugs with limited demand.

Doubt it. If you check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwOBTzFUDME) at around the 7 minute mark he starts talking about IP and innovation and points out that most of the best medical innovations and medicines had no need for IP in order to be created.

"Define ""real backing""? Most assets and currencies don't have a real backing.  Gold, for example, is pretty and has some industrial uses but its value is orders of magnitude higher than it can justify for those cases.  It's valuable truly because it is a decoupling mechanism from fiat, because it has perceived scarcity, and because others will accept it.

Fiat currencies ""backing"" is the threat of force.  That is, if you don't use fiat to pay your taxes someone will show up with a gun eventually and take you somewhere dark.  I don't really consider this a real backing, but rather artificial forced usage.  In this case, usage is giving the currency value, not any sort of intrinsic attribute of the underlying asset, especially since we are long removed from the gold standard.  Even with this forced usage many government currencies are mismanaged.  Money is printed and inflation occurs causing these massive dips and spikes in value that you speak of, and it's devastating to people who hold that currency.  Fiat currencies hold no guarantee of scarcity.

The closest thing I can imagine with a ""real backing"" is probably oil, which has experienced high volatility at times in its past.  These weren't good situations, but they didn't remove the fact that oil was still useful, and still worth something, and the recovery came.

Bitcoin has stronger scarcity guarantees than gold and is also easier to hold, manage, and send than gold.  It's gaining usability that isn't forced, like fiat, but rather voluntary.  It's a stateless, geopolitically removed network that doesn't live and die by the whims of people in the financial offices of a single country.  I certainly don't imagine a small team of humans deciding how much to devalue my bank account in 100 years, I imagine no one having that power. 

Back to your question about volatility. It's true that massive dips and spikes in value aren't the best for a world currency, but bitcoin is still in growth and expansion phases.  The more money that flows in, the more dramatic changes would be required to push the price up or down.  Furthermore, the longer it's around and the larger it becomes the less nervous and reactive people are, and the more financial instruments are introduced which can help stabilize price.  I believe this future will come, and while I'm happy to use it as a polished, highly efficient, mostly stable, ""solved"" currency then, I rather be on board way before.  The volatility stages are where you get your position and can make a name for yourself in the project and shape its future.

I really hope that either you are wrong or this is not the system that is being standardized.

">Define ""real backing""? Most assets and currencies don't have a real backing.

Dollars have backing from whatever country they are from. The value of american dollars is effectively tied to the american economy and government. Unless you believe that the entire economy will utterly collapse, then the american dollar will always have value. And yeah, during times of economic crisis the dollar goes down, but it never collapses. And as long as the country and government stay intact, it will always rebound. Dollars aren't perfect, but they are **incredibly** stable relative to most other currencies. 

>Gold, for example, is pretty and has some industrial uses but its value is orders of magnitude higher than it can justify for those cases.

I'm not on the gold-train. Gold is over-valued when compared to it's industrial uses. It's value comes from style and fashion, which so far in almost all of human history has held strong. And although it's been valuable for those characteristics virtually forever, I don't put much stock in that. I agree gold isn't the answer. 

>Fiat currencies ""backing"" is the threat of force. That is, if you don't use fiat to pay your taxes someone will show up with a gun eventually and take you somewhere dark. I don't really consider this a real backing, but rather artificial forced usage.

Ok so this is pretty nonsensical. We're talking about the value of the currency, not taxes. The value of the american dollar comes from the fact that the U.S. government recognizes it as currency, it can be used to buy virtually any product or service in america, and because of that other governments and banks will willingly exchange other forms of currency for american dollars. This has absolutely nothing to do with taxes. American dollars still hold value even if you don't live in america. (Same goes for any other dollar).

>In this case, usage is giving the currency value, not any sort of intrinsic attribute of the underlying asset, especially since we are long removed from the gold standard.

I agree. The value comes from the money being usable. But that will always hold true as long as the given country stays intact. Canadian dollars for example, will always have value as long as Canada exists and the government recognizes them. I don't believe for a second that Canada is going to dissolve into ruin, therefore I have confidence in the currency of Canada. My confidence in the currency comes from my confidence that the countries and governments themselves are relatively stable. 

I would put less stock in certain currencies based on these factors. I'm not a foreign political expert, but I'd say South Korea is in much greater threat of catastrophe than Canada is (Due to N.K.), so I'd put relatively less stock in their currency. 

>Bitcoin has stronger scarcity guarantees than gold and is also easier to hold, manage, and send than gold.

I don't put much stock in gold. So I agree, but it's sort of irrelevant. 

>I certainly don't imagine a small team of humans deciding how much to devalue my bank account in 100 years, I imagine no one having that power.

Here's where you're mistaken. When you buy bitcoin you're putting that power in the hands of **everyone**. Do you trust the collective populous to make rationale long-term economic decisions? Because I don't. I trust experts. I trust established governments that have been operating successfully for literally hundreds of years.

>Furthermore, the longer it's around and the larger it becomes the less nervous and reactive people are

Sure but ""less nervous"" from what? If I think there's an X% chance of a chain reaction of panic-sellers causing a huge crash, and you tell me that the more money flowing in decreases to an X-N% chance, it's not really useful. I'm not claiming to know or even have a guess as to what those percentages might be, but I believe that they are dramatically more likely than entire countries or governments collapsing and crashing the dollars. 

>and the more financial instruments are introduced which can help stabilize price.

Like what? Some examples of what you mean would be good. Cause I honestly have no idea what you're talking about here.

Also as a last note of sorts, who's to say that bitcoin ""wins"" in the end? There's tons of different crypto currencies that exist now. If everybody waits for a ""winner"" before they buy in, then none of them will ever get off the ground. But if people do buy in early, and that particular crypto currency loses out to a competitor, all of those people get screwed. Crypto currencies can pop up willy-nilly forever, and every time a new one pops up and gains some traction, old one's will crash. You'd have to be able to somehow prevent competition between the currencies in order to maintain stability.

"> Someone still has to pay, even in ""universal healthcare"". They're called tax payers.

You forget that money is not a fundamental thing, it's an abstraction. Money exists in your head.

In reality it's the society providing service. Money is just how we account for that so it's all balanced, but it's not how it fundamentally works.

Continuously thinking about money will make you dull and bitter. E.g. suppose you have a kid and you give him food. For a normal person, it's just that -- you are feeding your kid.

For a market obsessed person, well, perhaps, kid isn't getting food for free, you paid for the food, right? It's not free food. So maybe your kid owes you something.

Or when you pick an apple from a tree. Apple tree doesn't charge you. But, of course, you could now sell this apple on the market, it stills has some value, right? So if you eat this free apple you, like, spend $0.01 you didn't have.

Metering everything is just absurd.  Do you want to meter sunlight, water in rivers, etc?

I live in a country with universal healthcare. In many cases it is unmetered -- that is, I can just go to a doctor, he gives me diagnostic advice, and might not even record it anyway. Government already paid this doctor's time, he just sits there and helps people.

"But... do you see that in terms of functional language, there is no difference between saying ""ONE million-dollars"" and ""ONE bit-coin""?

For a long long time, nobody bought groceries with DOLLARS, they bought them with CENTS. They took the dollar and cut it up into 100 bits and gave those bits a new name - the cent.

This is exactly the same as Bitcoin (except there are 100 million pieces per Bitcoin).

Right now when you buy Bitcoin, you don't buy it in neat round amounts (unless you are anal and have a calculator), you put in $100 and get, as of tonight, 0.02292BTC. Right now we find that hard to read, hard to understand whether having one zero after the decimal point and then a number means ""lots of money"" or ""not much money"".

But I've half-trained myself already to know that 0.01 is $50, 0.001 is $5 and 0.0001 is 50c. (for now, it will change). So when I'm doing a transaction and considering the fee, I know if there are three zeroes after the decimal point, the fee will be $5 or less and if there are FOUR zeroes then the fee isn't worth worrying about. (It's all 5s for me because I don't work in USD and 1.0BTC is 5000-ish in my fiat.)

We've grown up with ""lots"" of money being written as a number, then a comma, then three zeroes, then three more zeroes. All that's changing is the comma is becoming a decimal point.

1.000000 is the same as 4,400.000 (in USD, more or less). Simple as that. I get the 1 turning into a 4 is confusing right now, but when BTC hits 10,000, then reading your wallet value will get a bit more intuitive.

"Your idea of only funding ER care through taxes is a good start, but flawed for two reasons.   

First, we all already pay for ER care for the uninsured as hospitals raise their rates (and in some cases, may be allowed to bill the state if I recall) to make up for the money they couldnâ€™t collect from those patients.   

Second, care can be incredibly expensive and ruinous to peopleâ€™s budgets. For example, this winter I had the flu, or so I thought (fever on the couch sleeping all weekend). I eventually went to the urgent care place (not ER, think walk-in clinic). Nurse practitioner took a nose swab, ran the test on the spot, told me I had the flu, wrote a prescription. Also cleaned out my ears with special high pressure water tool because they had been clogged with wax for over a year. The cost of this 20 total minutes of the nurse practitioners time? $400. Plus $75 for the prescription medication. So $475 for something that was through no fault of my own.  

Thatâ€™s 65.5 hours (more than a week at 40hr!) of working at minimum wage *before* taxes. Thatâ€™s more than a family of four spends on groceries. All because the expensive insurance my family pays good money for (over $20k per year, which is a big chunk of our gross income) is a high-deductible health plan which doesnâ€™t cover anything until the family spends $12k or one individuals costs exceed $6k. So we are responsible for every dime up to $12k a year.   

Most Americans have no savings, let alone enough to cover $12k worth of medical expenses. Iâ€™m very privileged that my family did have the savings to cover it, but in some families living paycheck to paycheck, they would have gone hungry, been late on rent, or missed a payment on their car that month, all because someone got sick.   

No American should have to work more than a week, risk going hungry, losing a place to live, or lose their car (which they probably need to get to their job!) just because someone in their family had the flu for a weekend and went to the doctor to get treated. It simply should never happen, period. And full universal healthcare is the answer to that. ";6;1;False;nathreed;dm9z1cv;A glimpse into the future;6wpdei;https://i.redd.it/7dvqdd5lbmiz.jpg

"Doctors still get paid under universal healthcare. The cost of one medical procedure is split amongst the entire population, that way if one person happens to become sick (which can happen to anyone) they don't have to pay all of it on their own.

You could also choose to adopt the Dutch healthcare system, which is a little more right than universal healthcare in the UK.

The Dutch system works like this: everybody has a monthly cost of health insurance and they have a deductible. They can balance the cost of these how they see fit themselves to a certain extent. 

If you're young and you don't think you'll get sick you go for a high deductible (maxed at about $1000) and low monthly costs (minimum of $100).

If you're old and you think you'll probably need to see a specialist doctor like a surgeon, you'd go for a low deductible (at least $400) and high monthly costs (maximum of $125)

There are multiple insurers so the price between insurers differs and sometimes you get a better price with one insurer than the other because of the relatively  free market.

Children under 18 are insured for free with their parents and get full benefits. Visits to the family doctor or g.p. do not count towards your deductible and people are therefore not discouraged to go to the doctor.
