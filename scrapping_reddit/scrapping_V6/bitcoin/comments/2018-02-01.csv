Main aim is to reduce power consumption, but at the same time that's the main reason cards get hot. Pretty much all the electricity GPU consumes turns to heat. How much power GPU is drawing depends more about how big voltages it is using, not how many MHz it's running on that voltage.;1;0;False;erittainvarma;dtk8r4s;Bitcoin..

"In theory, Bitcoin could work.

But leave it to humans to create a thousand alts that only destroy faith in Bitcoin's value. Worse than printing fiat now. We just can't leave a good idea alone.

There's a reason gold has been the only real money for centuries. Indestructible. Alt-Gold can not exist and there's nothing humans can do to change that.

"The problem is that use-case is at odds with what it's actually designed for. Speculative investing in a currency by definition sort of undermines it's viability to be a currency. The more speculative it's use becomes, the less accepted it'll be as a currency (as seen with several high-profile storefronts no longer accepting it as payment) meaning the only way to reap the benefits would be to convert it back to Fiat.

What's more, I see a lot of people seeing theoretical numbers of how much they made, but that doesn't really mean a lot if the only way to actually get that into a usable state is converting it back to fiat.
