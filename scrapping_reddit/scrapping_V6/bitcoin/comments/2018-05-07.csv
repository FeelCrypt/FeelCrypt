">You obviously have no training in market dynamics.

And, pray, why do I have to? You'd be better to skip the tiresome condescending and make your point. You sound like a bitter refugee from r investing who got into crypto too late.

As I said if they're not scared they're fucking stupid. Whether it's 4 billion 40 billion or 400 billion that's not in their hands.

I've been reading disparaging comments like yours on here for six years. If you don't think Bitcoin or some crypto will not transform finance you're sorrily mistaken.

">>You obviously have no training in market dynamics.

Because you actually think there's 400$ billion in crypto, lololol, when you can quantitatively measure the actual dollar amount is less than five billion based on the last sell off, half of which is irredeemable tether. Paper market, with no liquidity backing it.

>You sound like a bitter refugee from r investing who got into crypto too late.

I actually sold all mine at 16k, and dont plan on buying at these prices. Might buy some more at 2k just for the lulz. Until then I'm happy making 200k+/annum in the futures markets.

>As I said if they're not scared they're fucking stupid. Whether it's 4 billion 40 billion or 400 billion that's not in their hands.

This is next level stupidity. That's not how banking works, kiddo. 

>If you don't think Bitcoin or some crypto will not transform finance you're sorrily mistaken.

LOLOLOL...lol. Make sure to message me when it does, lol.

"You are muddying my original point with straw man tactics. The point is all that value is not in a bank. You're obsessing over how much it is exactly.

>I actually sold all mine at 16k, and dont plan on buying at these prices.

So you mean you didn't buy back at 6000 and sell at 11000? 

> Might buy some more at 2k just for the lulz. 

You honestly think it's going to 2000? Now who's the noob?

>This is next level stupidity. That's not how banking works, kiddo.

If it's in crypto it's not in their possession. Stop being an obtuse cunt.";1;1;False;ebaley;dylpsua;What a time to be alive!;8g8vqu;https://i.redd.it/rbt35cjw89v01.jpg
