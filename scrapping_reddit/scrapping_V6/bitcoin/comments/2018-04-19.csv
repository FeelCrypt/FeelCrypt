See heres the thing I dont want to mine. I want a 1080 so I can play my vidya games at a higher resolution. I dont want to pay stupid money though since they were way cheaper before. ;2;1;False;Wendys_frys;dxlf23a;Whoever put this up deserves a medal;8d3ziy;https://i.redd.it/b5ndht3yjms01.jpg

It can. 1080s are mighty beasts. If you know what to mine, you can recover the entire amount in a year. Also, since you have gaming computer, the CPU is also good. Mine cryptonight algorithm on it. It'll pay for electricity while gpu will pay for itself. ;1;0;False;;dxm3z6d;Whoever put this up deserves a medal;8d3ziy;https://i.redd.it/b5ndht3yjms01.jpg
Probably not. On one card I realistically could not mine enough coin to pay for anything. ;1;1;False;Wendys_frys;dxlvr0h;Whoever put this up deserves a medal;8d3ziy;https://i.redd.it/b5ndht3yjms01.jpg

The obvious example is the story of Jesus feeding a crowd of people using five loaves and two fishes (which David Blaine will never top).;1;0;False;Essehm;dxm58v3;Whoever put this up deserves a medal;8d3ziy;https://i.redd.it/b5ndht3yjms01.jpg
