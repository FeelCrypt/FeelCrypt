Yes it does.   Technical change is guaranteed to upset users if the constraints of the system mean that change is mathematically required to restrict the  operation  in a way that is known would in theory impact an end user's  costs or workflow;   In this case the in-place change of allocating more databits for divisibility  reduces the number of bits available for  representing large magnitudes.

I have given you the authoritative reference, which is the demonstrable details  that derive directly from mathematics,  the protocol specification, and the mechanics of the C programming language,  and now the burden of proof is on you to show how such an outlandish, extraordinary, and counterintuitive claim of ""infinite divisibility""  could possibly be serviced   without any of the caveats and problems explained.

And back in the 1600s it was anyways accepted as fact that the earth was an entirely flat surface.    Matter of fact,  some folks still make that claim that to this day  in spite of empirical observations and mathematical calculations  that show it as an indefensible argument.

Your claims are on a par with the flat-earthers,  And it's not the round-earthers'  job to   try and find more round-earthers' to disagree with you ----  on the contrary,   when you make such extraordinary claims of infinite divisibility,  the burden of proof is on the person making that claim to show how it is so.....

"You would never do something which would upset the users to begin with. Technical change does not mean automaticly upsetting the users.
This would need to changes from the userbase etc. only a stupid dev would force a change of behavior to the userbase.

I asked for a reference and you jump on to give examples, but why should i believe a random stranger on reddit with not a single authoritative reference?

Actually, i'm not even that interested in this particular subject. Back in the early days (~2011) it was anyways accepted as fact that bitcoin would be ""infinitely divisible"" at least to the tune of practicability and wallets were back then limited on the number of decimal place for practical purposes. If we start arguing about infinity we must face that *nothing* is infinite.";1;1;False;PulsedMedia;dq6obdz;This is why I want bitcoin to hit $10,000;7dpypn;https://i.redd.it/fhzsxgcv9nyz.jpg
