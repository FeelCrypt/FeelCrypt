And yet you pay exchange fees... While I can withdraw cash from any ATM for $0 thanks to Schwab not having physical banks. Do you know banks' main source of revenue? Interest on loans that are based on minimum reserves. They use those reserves as a basis to borrow money from the fed at the fed funds rate and loan that money out to consumers at a marginally higher rate. It's aritrage. The fees are a drop in the bucket for bank business.;1;0;False;lewdite;dunnn86;Bitcoin Doesn't Give a Fuck.;7yaaz2;https://v.redd.it/ty2y74gawug01

"Consider for a moment that maybe you're wrong. What do you know about macroeconomics and the various testified fiat currency over the last 50 years? What can your tell me about the Sterling crash of '92? Maybe you should be educating yourself on the economy at large before making assumptions based on obviously little knowledge. Being an ""expert"" in Bitcoin isn't saying much at all.";1;1;False;lewdite;dunniad;Bitcoin Doesn't Give a Fuck.;7yaaz2;https://v.redd.it/ty2y74gawug01
And yet by natural design it doesn't scale well. Not only does scale increase the difficulty and power requirements for mining (upon which the entire blockchain relies) but a network with more and more nodes becomes slower as sychronization time must increase as a matter of physics. Information transfer does not happen instantaneously or even at the speed of light.;1;0;False;lewdite;dunnrs5;Bitcoin Doesn't Give a Fuck.;7yaaz2;https://v.redd.it/ty2y74gawug01
"First around $8,500 in the short term, then the low of ~$6,900 but I believe $6,500 to be a psychologically important level and the most likely level of resistance should the downtrend continue. 

It could easily break below that very quickly given the momentum and volatility. ";1;0;False;lewdite;dunt6wp;Bitcoin Doesn't Give a Fuck.;7yaaz2;https://v.redd.it/ty2y74gawug01
"Oh yeah, so unpredictable right? Who could have seen this recent move downward after testing resistance...


Oh wait, it's doing exactly what I said to would. 

How do you feel about technical analysis now? Maybe it's time you researched how an economy works so you have a better understanding of how assets are traded.";1;1;False;lewdite;duno2m1;Bitcoin Doesn't Give a Fuck.;7yaaz2;https://v.redd.it/ty2y74gawug01

"It was actually $11,694 but there's some variance to be expected during intra-day trading. The key is that it didn't break out above that level and thus failed an important test of investor resolve.

People saw the price reach the last peak and decided to sell rather than buy more... That's the main point to take away from this. In the investing world this called a ""double top""";1;1;False;lewdite;dunsfap;Bitcoin Doesn't Give a Fuck.;7yaaz2;https://v.redd.it/ty2y74gawug01
