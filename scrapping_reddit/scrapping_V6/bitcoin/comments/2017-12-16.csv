"Hey, you were the one who first said ""I can't even respond to this"" to perfectly reasonable statements.

But I think I've diagnosed you: your ego is so wrapped up in the notion that higher education makes you superior that the existence of people who don't esteem it as highly is an affront to you. That someone might possess a point of view you hadn't considered is a personal insult: after all, you can't stop talking about how much better your ability to discern ""nuance"" is than those filthy, uneducated plebians. That your own arguments are fallacious is irrelevant, after all, you're educated; even if what you said is wrong, *you*'re still right.

How dare dissenters not pursue education for as intellectual of reasons! How dare an engineer pursue the study of physics, not to critique literature, but to learn to create labor-saving devices! How dare an entrepreneur study business, not to ""fight the status quo"", but to provide for himself and his family! How dare a doctor pursue the study of medicine, not to consider Marx, but to heal the sick! *How dare they pursue education not for its own sake, but as a tool to better the world? Don't they know that the purpose of education is to place themselves on a pedestal and silence opposition?*";1;1;False;pwag42;drb8y7h;Nothing can increase by that much and still be a good investment.;7jht7c;https://i.imgur.com/oWePY7q.jpg

From meeting some of this team recently and chatting to them on their forum they are currently researching the development of an open source space launch system for nanosatellite payloads (think ROCKETS!) and are working on ways to increase their engagement and outreach activities with many different communities globally.

"Dear [u/PineappleFund](https://www.reddit.com/user/PineappleFund), I hope you have a little time to see a 5 minute youtube video called [Why Die?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25qzDhGLx8) and a 7 minute video called [Why Age?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoJsr4IwCm4) and will be convinced, like I am, that aging really is the biggest problem in the world today. It causes far more suffering and death than any other cause, or even all other causes combined, both in developed and in developing countries. I see that you have already made a great donation to SENS Research Foundation, that supports the most effective way forward to bring aging under medical control - that is addressing directly the types of damage that cause aging. It is beautiful and visionary that you have already chosen to support the work of SENS. I wish you will consider allocating to SENS an even bigger part of your donations, taking into account that aging really is the world's biggest problem, causing 100.000 deaths every day, and constant pain, suffering and indignity to millions more.

Fundraising for operations (teachers, food etc), is always tough, and I've tried everything... even starting up a leggings business called How We Soul (which we're shutting down soon due to lack of sales). My latest venture is crypto mining, and one rig (6x1070's) seems to generate enough to support 10-15 kids per month, fairly consistently (better than our fundraising events).

"Consider donating to the organization I work for: Foresight Institute, a non-profit institute focused on advancing the benefits, and avoiding the dangers of technologies of fundamental importance for the human future, e.g. molecular machines, longevity, cybersecurity, AI, and blockchains.

We’re a small organization but have a lot on our plate: 

- we do research on neglected risks, especially AI safety & cybersecurity and host private workshops, e.g. on AI Policy with MIRI, EFF, OpenAI, Google Brain, Future of Life Institute, Future of Humanity Institute, and other Ai safety orgs
--> Your donation would allow us to host additional meetings, which were requested by participants (requested topics: open vs close AI safety research, cybersecurity as catastrophic risk)
- We award the Feynman Prizes and the Foresight Fellowship to brilliant scientists to further their work in underfunded projects. Our 2007 Feynman Prize winner, Sir Fraser Stoddart won the shared Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2016 for his work in molecular machines.
--> Your donation would allow us to invite our prodigies to our gatherings so they can participate, present their work, and connect with mentors.

- We host invitational workshops to push for progress in specific scientific fields, e.g. longevity, AI, atomic precision. Previous workshop was described as ""the most interesting conference I have attended in years” by John Koza, Pioneer of Genetic Programming. 
--> Your donation would allow us to host two workshops next year, Nobel Prize Laureate Fraser Stoddart has agreed to chair the first workshop in May 2018 on Molecular Machines.

- we host salons free to the public and our Vision Weekend to get to work on topics of fundamental importance to our future. E.g. on ""Blockchain: The Next Frontier"" including Arthur Breitman, Tezos, Zooko Wilcox, ZCash, Jorge Lopez, ESCA, Mark Miller, Foresight Institute  ""Long-term thinking: The Tools To Make It Beyond The Century"" including Joon Yun, Palo Alto Investors, Tom Kalil, previous White House Office for Science & Technology, Melanie Swan, Institute for Blockchain Studies, ""Longevity: Reaching Escape Velocity"" with Aubrey De Grey, SENS, Sonia Arrison, Thiel Foundation, Max More, Alcor Life Extension, Kevin Perrott, Buck Institute, and more than 10 further topics.
--> Your donation would allow us to keep the always “sold-out’ salons free to the public and offer income-support for Vision Weekend.

- we collect a collaborative knowledge graph to steer humanity toward positive long-term futures at existentialhope.com
--> Your donation would allow us to ask experts in different fields (e.g. asteroid mining) to populate sub-sections of the index and recruit brilliant people to work on more long-term projects

For a full list of 2017 achievements and how your donation would allow us to continue each project in 2018, see https://foresight.org/donate.";1;0;False;seagrubb;drbamey;I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes!

"Thank you so much for this, OP!  Made me so happy to see that somebody is kind enough to do this!

We created Seeds Tokens (www.seedstokens.com) to allow tokenholders to ask the blockchain for help - and receive it - no strings attached.

In part because 96%+ of the BTC wealth is held by 4% of the addresses - perpetuating the same wealth disparity challenge in fiat - we're working to be mindful of doing whatever we can to get Seeds Tokens in the hands of as many diverse groups of people as possible.  

Each tokenholder can then makes a Needs Request to our system of front-end products, which have been integrated into about 30 apps, and it will be gifted to him/her, no strings attached.  It's a bit like a decentralized GoFundMe.

In 2013, I sold off my personal BTC holding to keep Seeds going when investors were ignoring us, often at least in part because of misogyny in institutionalized finance.

Now, I want to solve the problem of lack of funds due to discrimination - for all of us.  I believe we've found an effective way to do this at scale through the Seeds tokens vehicle.

However, we are not a non-profit, which was a philosophic choice.  I think the non-profit/for-profit binary was manufactured primarily for tax reasons in the US, and it has unfortunately led to rampant greed and zero-sum thinking in the for-profit space in too many cases, and lack of resourcing and efficiency in the non-profit sector in too many cases as well.

I believe Seeds can transcend that, creating a new paradigm - a system of abundance.

If this resonates with you, we'd be so grateful if you would be interested in engaging with us in whatever capacity feels appropriate to you.  

Regardless, thank you so much again for doing what you do!  Happy Holidays!";1;0;False;baerbelleksa;drcg7lp;I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes! Introducing The Pineapple Fund;7jj0oa;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7jj0oa/im_donating_5057_btc_to_charitable_causes/

"Generally speaking. Yusus, you can't say anything these days without being ripped to pieces. All I was trying to do was portray the severity of the situation to allow others to understand that it is a good cause to donate in order to help others.
Can't even do that these days with people judging you all over the place. If everyone is so judgemental what's the point of social media to create awareness when no one wants to hear you or you get shot down every sentence you make?
I do not understand why people use social media as a weapon to destroy others. And it  is mainly used as a method to hide behind distant walls in order to hurt others (which shows how small you actually are as a person where you cannot do that in real life).

"You could consider allocating a portion of the fund to creating incentive-packages for scientific breakthroughs. Instead of donating the funds to use directly (working capital) you create prize rewards for solving a specific problem. Much like e.g. the 1 million USD Millennium Prize Problems, but then to problems that are more directly beneficial for humanity (thinks like: photovoltaic cells for solar power with a specific yield for less than a specific cost, method for detecting cancer with specific accuracy and cost, desalination of water below specific costs, etc.).
Set a specific amount of bitcoin aside for each solved problem such that maybe in 10 years there is an enormous financial incentive to solve it. Like that you can spread the impact of your fund over many more years.

Problem definition in coorperation with reputable scientific journals (Nature, Cell, etc) and their readers. Safekeeping and verification of problem solving by several of the top reputable law-firms and funds in multisig wallet.

"We are running NavGurukul.org where we are working on providing Vernacular education for underprivileged students to learn high impact skills like Software Engineering, Life Coaching, etc. and represent their communities in the mainstream sectors through a one-year residential course. 

With a strong emphasis on frugality and sustainability, our per-student costs are about 1000$ inclusive of residential costs (food, accommodation, internet, laptops), and the students return the amount once they get the jobs to ensure every dollar trains more and more children.

We successfully placed our first batch, where the students learnt through peer interactions in absence of any qualified trainer.

"For climate change, human health and animal rights, Good Food Institute has huge potential if properly funded. It works on supporting companies developing plant-based and lab-based meats. The lab-based meats are grown from cells, with (eventually) no animal involvement past that point. The goal is to get these meats below the cost of regular meat, healthier, and tastier. They're close already, with lab-grown burgers at $11 and clean of any growth hormones etc. used in normal farming, and good reviews on the taste. Researchers in the area have identified some concrete blockers like developing a commercial cell food to drop prices further - donations now could hugely speed up adoption and save lives.

The thing I like best about this charity is it targets all these high-impact areas, in a way no-one else is doing:

1. Climate Change: lab-grown meats use 90% less resources (land, water) than regular, and don't produce methane since no actual animals are involved.

2. Human Health: These meats can be engineered more easily to contain higher levels of protein, vitamins and not to contain the growth hormones and similar used in most modern farming

3. Animals: factory farming is gruesome. I'll be glad to see it go.

Hope you get a chance to give it a look :-) It's one of those areas where the rate of progress makes you do a double take";2;0;False;Arathiam;drbvfxl;I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes!

"Please elaborate where have we met? 

And why are you saying this? If I didn’t care about helping people in need I would have never started this project.

I was three times in Munich CCC hackerspace showing progress of project and looking if there are people interested to join this project. Did we meet there?

This is fully open source project so there is no way any single person can benefit from this. We have intentionally kept everything fully open source.

If my goal was to get money I could have gotten it many times - but all investors only understand parents and proprietary projects. That is why this project has been self financed by me so far - to keep it fully open source to the core.

You can see all of our progress and what we did in last two years. Also our team members are also now contributing to Lede and OpenWrt projects.

So again I’m kindly asking you to explain where we met.

If you have been in middle of crisis situation with thousands where refugees that were arriving were totally lost and didn’t know where they arrived and where they were going because complete 3G and LTE infrastructure failed so they couldn’t use their phones to open google maps or to let their friends and families know they are alright.

We can give anyone who is interested contacts from humanitarian organisations that we worked with to provide free Wi-Fi to check with them if we charged them anything or if we volunteered and helped then with providing free Wi-Fi.

Some of organisations that we helped are Red Cross, Greenpeace, Jesuit Rescue Service, Mountain Rescue Service, Refugees Welcome and lots of small NGOs.

I can provide contacts form all of these organisations for anyone interested in double checking anything what we did and if we did this as volunteers or not.
