You're missing my point. I basically had a winning lottery ticket and gave it away. Now with prices fluctuating by as much as $2,000 in a day, it's just idiotic to use BTC as an actual currency to try and buy things. Nobody will accept it due to high fees and slow verification, plus the likely immediate loss in value. It's like trying to pay in timeshares on a car.;1;1;False;lesgeddon;dup30su;Bitcoin Doesn't Give a Fuck.;7yaaz2;https://v.redd.it/ty2y74gawug01

there are millions of dogs and cats tortured to death in China (Yulin) and Thailand (Tha Rae), which is the worst thing happening in this world imo - if you do charity, please do it for them. would be in with 1000$ usd in crypto if you arrange something.;1;0;False;Bison-indatent;duotbwu;I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes!
