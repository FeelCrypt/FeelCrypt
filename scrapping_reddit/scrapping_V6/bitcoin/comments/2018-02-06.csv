"You can, but if you do it to someone holding fiat, the best you can hope for is usually a small amount of cash. if they're using a bank, maybe walk them to an ATM and take out a few grand, tops. What else can a thief do, make you put a wire transfer through? It could be traced, and it could take days to go through, and reversed in the meantime (unless you've been kidnapped for days or a loved one is being held hostage, in which case you've got bigger problems).

With crypto, you can set up a wallet on a burner phone, force someone to instantly transact thousands, hundreds of thousands, or even millions to your wallet and distribute the sum to different wallets, putting it through heightened anonymity systems like Monero, etc. Can't be reversed, very difficult to trace (impossible really if it's planned well), and there's no third party that will intervene in the transaction. Decentralized anonymity works both ways. ";1;0;False;IWriteCrypto;dttogl0;What he would be wishing now? 😂;7mgy26;https://i.redd.it/shu3p1cshi601.jpg

Look at this objectively.  I'm up 25% in three months from this post.  If 2018 is even a quarter as good as 2017, it is mental.  And i said this in 2016.  Then 2017 happened.

"> If you are implying that bitcoin was invented be simply be a get rich quick scheme, which you clearly are,

I said no such thing asshole.  I've said at every single stage that if you don't understand bitcoin, you shouldn't be buying it.  And if you think you're deserved gains in two months of bitcoin exposure, then too fucking bad.  Wah wah wah.  

I had an 80%+ retracement from $1100 to less than $200 over an entire year in 2014.  

> That doesn’t make it a good currency.

Don't fucking buy it then.  No-one is holding a gun to your head ffs.  You wanna go to a casino and throw your money away, I aint gonna stop ya.  I reckon bitcoin is exactly meeting its use-case, and getting better every year.  I have played a long game, not two months, on bitcoin.  I have been handsomely rewarded for it, and I will continue to be.  Remind me in one year, two years, three years, five years.  I don't care.

But if you don't like bitcoin, fuck off.  Go away.  I don't want your money.  If you don't understand the value proposition of bitcoin, I'm not going to convince you.
