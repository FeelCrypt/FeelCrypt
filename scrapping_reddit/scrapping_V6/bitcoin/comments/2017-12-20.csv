"You should donate to WAMM. They are an incredible non profit based out of Santa Cruz CA. They donate the majority of their funds to a compassion program that gives out high grade medical cannabis oils, tinctures, and flowers to the seriously ill who cannot afford it. I have never once come across a group who are so committed to a mission of giving and healing. 

Here is the description from their website:
“ Founded in 1993, the Wo/Men’s Alliance for Medical Marijuana (WAMM) is the nation’s oldest continuously operating phytotherapies collective, one that still serves as a model of truly compassionate care 24 years later. By focusing on the needs of patients and caregivers, WAMM provides hope and builds community while offering a safe, organic supply of phytotherapies to patients with a doctor’s recommendation for the treatment of terminal and chronic illness.

Described as “the gold standard of medical marijuana” by a federal judge, WAMM was founded by Mike and Valerie Corral, a couple in Santa Cruz, California who first started secretly growing marijuana together in the 1970’s, after Valerie found the then illegal herb effective in helping to control her epileptic seizures. Following a pair of arrests, the Corrals resolved to help others facing similar persecution, and soon local patients started seeking them out.

Since then, what started as a handful of seriously ill patients banding together has grown into a collective membership of more than 2,000 seriously intentioned citizens. Beyond growing and distributing phytotherapies and related products, WAMM also plays a vital role in advocating for the rights of cannabis patients and providers, including by helping pass Proposition 215, California’s medical marijuana law.

In 2002, the Drug Enforcement Agency raided the WAMM garden and destroyed the collective’s entire crop of state-legal phytotherapies. Several members died as a result of being cut off from their supply. In response, less than two weeks after the DEA raid, WAMM gathered on the steps of City Hall, alongside the mayor of Santa Cruz and other local officials, to defiantly distribute free medicine to members.

Next, with support from the ACLU and the City of Santa Cruz, WAMM successfully sued the federal government. The garden was subsequently replanted, and now grows more beautifully than ever.

Today, WAMM membership is open to all California residents with a valid doctor’s recommendation to use medical marijuana. But please note, we do not sell nor buy marijuana. Each member receives according to need and returns to WAMM according to ability. There are no financial or other demands required for participation. We only recover our costs.”

Disclosure: I have friends who are treated by WAMM and have been a supporter of theirs for a very long time.
Do your own research tho and it will reveal itself as the amazing healing organism that it is.

The guy literally said on his site he has enough money. He doesn't know what to do with all this so what better way to spend it on charities?;1;0;False;wittaz;driktpw;I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes!

"Yesterday I sat down the executive director of our nonprofit-www.ibmee.org- and explained to her what cryptocurrencies are and why I believe they are the future. I showed her the Pineapple Fund and proceeded to tell her that I believe we have a good chance of being honored with a donation. 

We spent several hours pouring our hearts and souls into filling out the very reasonable application. We could see the possibility for millions, maybe billions, of children to no longer be victims of educational systems (or lack of) designed to make them rule following robots who can't freely think or feel!  

We sent off our application feeling optimistic that we would stand out. Our passion and dedication won't let anything get in our way. We have sacrificed our personal creature comforts, wondering if we will pay rent, afford groceries or be able to fix our cars....we trust and somehow the money shows up. We spend our evenings coaching, on boards and social justice committees, networking, volunteering, and even provide a program pro-bono to a high-risk school. 

When you are giving to a nonprofit, you are betting on the people. I want you to know we are the kind of people you can bet on. As I reflect upon our invitation to donate to i.b.mee. I may have left out the best part...my story that lead me here. 

The Dark before the Dawn-

*I will never forget looking in the mirror and seeing the entire left-hand side of my body limp and unresponsive. I didn't know who I was or what I needed. I felt scared and alone.  I was only eight years old and I was having a stroke in my school's bathroom.*

I look back on this life event as the seed for all my future work. I now realize that my stroke was my brain and bodies cry for massive support and attention. I was shutting down. My whole life my family was stressed to the max and very demanding and I wasn't coping. I felt responsible for everyone and tried to be perfect...even hiding how sick I had become. I was experiencing what many children experience- poor health due to toxic stress or ACES (Adverse Childhood Experiences- google this!!). 

Three weeks later, I found the quote, ""Be the change you want to see in the world,"" It lite a fire within me. I became actively aware that a positive educational experience was necessary for people to climb out of the cycles of disempowerment. Over the next 20 years, I watched my sister and I struggle to cope with school and life. My sister was brilliant but by her sophomore year, she was practically a dropout and definitely a drug addict. I vowed to become an educator and prevent other brilliant kids from giving up on themselves. It was after 8 years of teaching in conventional and innovative school systems that I knew something systemically had to change. We were dumbing our kids down and teachers were struggling to meet the ever increasing demands of standardized testing that was pointless! ENOUGH WAS ENOUGH!

That was in 2014 since then I have helped launch an innovative nonprofit called i.b.mee. With other visionary leaders including a former IBM Coach and business leader, Mark Stamper, and other great minds from all over the world we are creating and research-backed roadmap to learning and growing in the 21st century. We are for education what bitcoin is for the economy...we are a disruption. We are rewriting the rules and educating the troops to co-create a new vision for our children. 

We are working with people all over the world to create the Declaration of Education! 

We have learned more about the brain, trauma, natural learning, motivation, and whole person wellness in the past 25 years then we have in the past 2,500!! 

It is time for a shift! Let me know if you have any more questions or would like to see our research handouts. 

Pine, Please take a few moments to consider my story and view our website: www.ibmee.org.

"I heard about this project last week and was blown away at the generosity and the opportunity. I put in an application but wanted to call out what we do here too. I'm not a business development person or a sales person, I am just a program manager who is really passionate about the work we do and believe we could make a huge impact on the communities we reach if only more people knew about us :)

I work for VecnaCares (www.vecnacares.org) a small non-profit based in Cambridge, MA. We work in areas where there is either no or unreliable electricity or cell network and in harsh environments (heat, dust, bugs, rain etc.). All of this combined means that having Electronic Medical Records in these areas is expensive and requires lots of money and expertise to maintain a server. But we've found a solution for this, to get EMR software the last mile to the clinic and the clinicians treating the patients. 

Our solution is the CliniPAK It is basically a server and power management system all in one. 
• Power Management: It can be powered off a solar panel, a car battery or AC power and it can seamlessly switch between them so if  it is rainy for a few days and your solar battery is depleted but you have a car battery plugged it it will automatically switch to the car battery.  
• Server: The CliniPAK creates a LAN (local area network) that allows any wifi enabled device to connect to it. We have deployed OpenMRS, DHIS2, Bahmni and our own EMR software onto the CliniPAK and once its deployed it can be accessed on any web browser. None of the data is stored on the cell phone or tablet it is all stored on the CliniPAK which means that you can have multiple doctors, lab or pharmacy techs or nurses working on the same patient record at the same time and it will instantaneously update. 
• Cell: Our newest model, which we are prototyping and designing now, has a cell modem built in meaning that this data can now be sent over a cell network when its available making the data accessible to people outside the immediate LAN.

Now you may be thinking 'a lot of these places where you're working need medicine and doctors. Why would we focus on getting Electronic Medical Records to them?' That 's a fair question but here are a few benefits of an EMR. 
1) It allows patients to be easily tracked over time. Imagine that you were pregnant two years ago and had a really complicated pregnancy and birth and it was all documented on paper but now you are pregnant again and that paper record is in a room where no one ever looks at them again because they can never find anything. Because you're doctor doesn't know about the issues you experienced during your last birth they can't treat you properly and you and your baby may be at risk for dying. Or if you are a patient with a chronic disease (such as high blood pressure or diabetes) they cannot track you progress. These electronic medical records allow doctor's to know your full medical history and to take all of that into account when they decide on a course of treatment.
2) Having an electronic system makes reporting and and identifying trends so much faster. With the press of a button a person can get a a full report that they need to submit to the Ministry of Health. Easy reporting also allows trends to be identifies much faster and for resources to be deployed to the appropriate areas. Imagine if the first record of from the 2014 Ebola outbreak was recorded electronically instead of on paper. Instead of that record having to go from the clinic to the county health department to the state and then up to the ministry of health to be reviewed it could of be sent directly to the relevant person. In outbreaks such as the Ebola crisis time is everything and knowing where and when cases are occurring as soon as possible is key in preventing the spread. Having an electronic medical record system allows for this to happen. 

We currently work in Kenya, Haiti, Tanzania and Nigeria as well as in one of the largest refugee camps in the world but we want to expand to help organizations that are responding to humanitarian crisis. 

Right now we are small but I truly believe that with this help we could be mighty!! If you've made it to the end of this thank you and thank you for considering us :)";1;0;False;go_abi_go;drjk6tz;I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes!

"<3 this. Pineapples also have another connection that I find really interesting to what you are doing. It is a genius name. Pineapples are a symbol of wealth & hospitality. Your interpretation (Share the deliciousness) gives me goosebumps! I am all in for taking back our symbols (and money/power) and giving them new meanings. 

Your meaning: Something so sweet and nutritious is meant to be shared. YAS!!

Old meaning: 
""The European bastardization of the pineapple symbol, however, meant more than just hospitality—it meant prestige. The richest of the rich bought these fruits, however expensive to show off to other their ability to have them. Since demand relied on the few shipments between the far-off continents, supply would often be scarce. This led to a brand new pineapple rental market taking the European gentry by storm, writes historian Mary V. Thompson. Although, by the 1700s, Europeans started growing them in their own hothouses.

"""Only offer financial support""??? I think you are changing lives. So many nonprofits have been scraping by with their hands tied by archaic funding from foundations that may not truly want innovation and individual empowerment.

"Dude, you're something else with anecdotal stories that no one cares about.

Point is dogs are super simple creatures and live life in the moment. What you see is what you get. Shelters encourage adopters to spend time with animals to get to know them before making a choice. Any educated adopter can make an inference to how that animal is as a whole. Dogs don't know to impress anyone. That type of environment means nothing until the dog has had enough.

There is a clear difference between a quiet dog and a dog that is shutting down. People don't adopt dogs that are shut down anyway so it's a non-issue if the dog will be different at home. And those who do already know the dog will be different. That's why there's a push for those dogs to go into a foster home in order to give them a second chance. It's more for the benefit of the dog than the person.

You can opt to purchase a dog if that's your choice. But people buy instead of adopt because of false information on adopting or buying.";1;1;False;;drhzhpk;Sold some bitcoin to buy my new best bud 🤗;7kqq1j;https://i.redd.it/16bgn309ys401.jpg

"You are right. There are a lot ""problematic"" dogs in shelters. That can have a lot of reasons... I should have mentioned  that my post was based on my personal experience I've made with shelters/ organizations in Germany and lots of adopted dogs. My mistake. I can really say I haven't seen any ""sugarcoating"" when describing the dogs. Because of the reason I mentioned above. Those people tying to find a new permanent home for the dogs. They don't make profit from it. The worst thing is if the owner brings back the dog after a few days/ weeks. They mention how the dogs behaves towards humans, children, other dogs, cats etc. Ofc if it's a dog from the streets history is unknown. But then again, they won't set up the dog for adoption without knowing it/ being able to give information about it.

To reduce the chance in getting dogs which might have experienced bad stuff and evoked bad attitude/ behavior you can also adopt puppies.
Concerning health I must say, if you get pure breeds from not certified/ legit breeders, depending on the race, you almost always gonna have problems -> puppy mills.

"Yeah. Some people don't understand the responsibility that comes with a living, breathing pet. I think it would also really help to educate the public about neutering their dogs or at least keeping their dogs from getting pregnant. Cause imagine if your dog at home gets pregnant and has a bunch of puppies and you can't find homes for them or take care of them yourself so you take them to the shelter.

Also it's not just bad people who can't take care of their dogs that end up in shelters. Some people die, some people face disasters, who knows. It's just unethical to keep supporting puppy mills.";1;0;False;dank_n_dabbie;drhxpnx;Sold some bitcoin to buy my new best bud 🤗;7kqq1j;https://i.redd.it/16bgn309ys401.jpg
"getting a dog from a good breeder does not predispose you to a dog with any more health issues than a shelter dog, unless you select an inherently healthy breed.

a poor breeder? yes. 

a puppy mill? absolutely. 

a good breeder? no. 

i am not sure about germany, but rescues here tend to say ""he loves everyone!"" (= he is hyperactive and jumps on everyone) or ""she's just a little shy!"" (= she is extremely fearful and undersocialized, and may bite out of fear) and like i said before ""needs an experienced owner"" (= he has a bite history)

the descriptions of the dogs are always very vague and nicely worded to sort of anthropomorphize the dogs.

That wasn't an argument. The mills would be shut down and the impregnating of dogs to be bred for them would stop. The dogs currently in the mill could be sold for low adoption fees by the organization putting an end to mills. Or, the mill would be forced to sell its last set of dogs at their price of choosing. Those specially bred mill dogs would be bought by the public fairy quickly. Then, there would be an end to the mill cycle. Shelters are flooded with abandoned animals who get euthanized daily and that is the ethical issue at hand. ;1;1;False;dank_n_dabbie;drhwa43;Sold some bitcoin to buy my new best bud 🤗;7kqq1j;https://i.redd.it/16bgn309ys401.jpg
"Are you going to buy all the extra puppies in the world and then personally make sure the breeders slow down their business despite the demand for puppies being greater than ever? No, they'll say ""every single puppy was bought, better make even more to keep up with demand"".

I love animals, but to think all of them can be saved would make me a hypocrite. Look up ""galapagos goat shooting"" and tell me how you would save every animal. You can't. You don't want to kill the goats? Well if you let the goats live, native species die. The correct answer is to kill the goats to preserve biodiversity. It would have been best if humans never introduced goats to begin with, but we can't change that now. It's harsh, but yes, some should die so less will suffer later. 

I don't support the pet trade at all. There are too many irresponsible pet owners out there. Many abandon their pets because they think they're being merciful by releasing them into the wild, or they just don't have the heart to put down the animal when they don't want it anymore so they release the thing. Well, that may be fine for their ex-pet, but it can wreak havoc on native and endangered species. Just look at the boa constrictor problem in florida, or feral cats, which are a huge threat to wild bird populations. What should we do with these harmful animals? Spaying and neutering helps, but it's expensive and it doesn't stop them killing native wildlife until that neutered individual dies. So, should we kill these problem animals for the greater good? Yes, absolutely. Preserving biodiversity and native habitat is way more important than the lives of these cats and other invasive species introduced by humans. 

The pet trade further threatens endangered species by supporting demand for wildlife trafficking. Many parrot species are threatened because people are selfish and just want a colorful bird as a pet, not thinking about how it effects the rest of the world. If you must have a pet, adopt it, and be sure you're prepared to commit to keeping your pet for it's whole life. The only dogs that should be bred are the ones with special jobs, such as police dogs, shepherd's dogs, dogs for the blind, etc.";0;0;False;Tororoi;dris6cy;Sold some bitcoin to buy my new best bud 🤗;7kqq1j;https://i.redd.it/16bgn309ys401.jpg
