Gambling is shunned by society. Bitcoin is being celebrated, the continual posts come across almost as propaganda, celebrating the price increases and at times causing the next ones. Maybe, this posturing by the community might lead people to have false expectations from bitcoin. Especially desperate people, who don't have a lot to lose.

"> I think the issue is conflating the decreasing rate of supply increase with the change in demand.

That i agree with.

> All else being equal, a slower rate of supply increase shouldn’t increase prices. 

I'm trying to understand your side but I don't get it.

SO let's say that there is constant demand, no new people buying bitcoin, just the same people wanting to buy the same number of coins each day.

If the rate of supply drops to a tiny fraction, let's say 1BTC per day. Then you're saying that won't affect the price?

Or if the supply suddenly jumps up to a billion a day, that won't affect price either? (i'm aware there's only about 21M BTC but you get my point)

Or are you saying that the difference in production supply gets naturally balanced out by people selling existing supply? What about all the coins that simple aren't up for sale?

"The recent surge is mostly due to public awareness (People see the exponential rise and want in). The return on Investment has been higher than any market we have ever seen, so naturally this attracts alot of attention. 

You can think of this market similar to the dot-com markets of the late 90s. During that era, we witnessed the birth of the Internet and the bubble that came with it. Right now we're witnessing the birth of blockchain technology, and hence the bubble that comes with it.

You can research what the blockchain is but I'll try to quickly explain. In essence, it allows for the creation of decentralised services. Bitcoin is the worlds first decentralised currency. It has no owners, no central servers, anyone can chose to participate and join the network. Its peer to peer (no middlemen), permissionless (no gatekeepers), open source (anyone can view the code/ monetary policy). This system is the exact opposite of what we currently have with the central banking system, where the fed had exclusive power over the currency.

Cause nobody gives a shit about you wanting to give your pals an insignificant amount of money according to your whims.  
Your example of transacting money without a middleman or agent, not a central authority, that would be a presiding regulator, mind your ignorance here, is one of the fruits of blockchain tech. Which does not have much to do with bitcoin itself. Btc is just the first crypto originated on the blockchain system. Thats all there is to bitcoin.  
Moreover, blockchain is what should be sought out and developed. The tech bitcoin is based on is revolutionary when it comes to removing transaction costs, which you mentioned. An ideal world would be one where everyone transacts their home currencies on a blockchain system with the Fed controlling the supply.  
Where does that leave us when it comes to bitcoin? Very very low adoption, little intrinsic value, high conversion costs. Most of all, very low utility.

* the statute of limitations for a lawsuit (class action or otherwise) regarding that is still valid in many locations

* Its now an amount of money that would be interesting for attorneys to pursue

* It would obviously be completely impossible to figure any of that out...

* Theres now motivation to pursue (criminally) for the hack given that its become a crime that would arguably endanger national/international security because its ~$8.5 billion dollars instead of a few mil

* Theres motivation to pursue it because it would further legitimize the BTC market and major exchanges are coming on board (CME/Nasdaq/etc) as well as the entire financial community that likely need or want the market to appear to be at least somewhat legitimate

* Further motivation because its a theft of ~$8.5 billion dollars of a currency which is supposedly used mostly by ""criminals and money launderers"" (as opposed to just cash obviously because its much cleaner... 90% of it literally has cocaine residue on the bills themselves)

* A bold move cotton... trying to hide $8.5 bil when even ~$500 transactions are automatically reported by almost all systems... lets see how this pans out

"From the recent Change My View thread:

>I understand where you are coming from, but my argument is that to some degree, the greater fool theory is irrelevent and not particularly uncommon even in the accepted stock markets of the world.
Most stocks right now that you buy in companies off things like the New York Stock Exchange do not pay dividends, ie there are not quarterly or annual payouts of profits to stockholding investors. Furthermore, there is nothing necessarily linking stock value to profits. For instance it is entirely possible that a company loses money, but its stock value still goes up anyway. This leads to a certain divorce from reality in some ways. The stock itself is worthless (it pays you nothing), beyond what a 2nd person is willing to pay for it for whatever reason
So why the heck can say Tesla's stock value go up like this over the past year, when during that same time period they have posted losses >$200 million each quarter!? Now you might say, /r/taranaki, its because people think in 10 years Tesla might be making large profits. Sure. Except I would also say, in such a scenario, is that piece of (now electronic) paper that sits in your vault paying you any more money w/ the company making millions in profits versus millions in losses? They answer is NO! Its still paying out $0 in dividends. In fact its only value is that now other people will want to buy the stock, and then sell it to someone else on the thought they will expect SOMEONE ELSE to want it for more money if quarterly reports look good. Why!? Because thats just what people are ""supposed to do"". But implicitly if someone declared tomorrow stocks can no longer be traded, then you still have a worthless piece of paper in a profit or loss scenario(because it doesnt pay dividends).
Do you kind of get the shell game that goes on in real stocks? Its the exact same speculation that goes on w/ bitcoin. People want bitcoin, because they believe that other people will want it based on the thought it will keep going up. People want Tesla stock on the thought that OTHER people will want it due to the thought that if earnings go up a 3rd person will want it for even more (even though increased earnings in a vacuum doesnt help or hurt the owner of the stock if he cant trade it to a 3rd party)

Though personally if I won the lottery I wouldn't tell anyone, unless/until I did something that required an explanation. Which I might not do anyway.

"Why would backing make it stable? It’s not as if there is inherent stability to the valuation of a backing instrument. All money is based on the appraisal of some item’s value in aggregate, whether the item is a specific mass of a precious metal, a specific volume of petroleum, a specific quantity of special paper, or a digital representation of same.

The idea that backing a financial instrument with an asset makes the instrument value more stable than an alternative instrument backed by wishes and promises is provably false, and based mostly on a gut instinct that THINGS have REAL VALUE which is also provably false.

"I deliberately simplified the hell out of it to make it easier for people to understand.

Obviously there is far more to stock valuation than the assets over liabilities, the purpose was to reflect that a cash dividend reflects an asset which the shareholders already own either way.

You're nitpicking, and doing so badly.

As for liquidation, normally it occurs involuntarily with failing companies which is why the shareholders being at the end of the line matters. E = A - L, if L > A then yeah, the shareholders don't get shit. But if a successful company were to decide to liquidate overnight then they're absolutely going to get the net assets over liabilities. The only thing they wouldn't get is the value of the future revenue streams.

A company can be viewed as a combined asset (net assets in excess of liabilities) and future revenue stream. Whether the revenue stream is set to automatically reinvest or not is irrelevant.

When you pay for that coffee, you create and broadcast a transaction which says you want to move some Bitcoin to Starbucks' address. No funds actually move anywhere until a miner includes that in a block, which could take weeks depending on congestion and the fee you've set (it may even *never* be included if miners ignore it).

The Bitcoin does not sit in the mempool, the transaction does. Your client software will make everything look pretty by subtracting that amount from your balance and making sure not to spend those specific Bitcoin in another transaction, but they're still certainly under your control. 

You could walk outside the coffee shop and create another transaction which spends those *same* Bitcoin to a different address, such as another of your own.

"For one, this isn't really a solid proof or reason that bitcoin isn't speculation (or that speculation is a solid investment), since it effectively just say ""what about stocks?"". It doesn't attempt to explain why something could be a solid investment and not a bubble even if there is no inherent value to anyone, it just says that stocks are just as much of a bubble.  
Secondly, there is clearly a fundamental misunderstanding of stocks. Stocks are a share of a company, a percentage of ownership. Even if that ownership doesn't pay dividends or even grant voting rights. In the worst case scenario of a company going bankrupt, you own a portion of that companies assets, and will be able to collect a percentage of their assets after debts are paid. Yes, stock prices can fluctuate independently of the companies profitability, because people speculate on stocks as they do any other investment, but speculating that the companies profits will go up is completely different from speculating on something with no inherent value. Speculating on a companies value can be an informed decision based on facts that the company will grow, and it can be right most of the time for everyone who speculates it because the whole economy grows and each individual company grows with it. Speculating on something without inherent value is what's called a bubble, you are speculating only that ""some greater fool"" will be willing to pay more than you did in the future, and is inherently unsustainable because eventually, when there is no greater fool with enough money to meaningfully effect the price, all the people who only ""invested"" in speculating that others would pay more will sell, since that was their intention all along. There is no point at which such a thing would happen for a companies stocks unless the company went bankrupt, in which case stockholders are at least entitles to a percentage of the companies assets and so there is still a price floor to which the stock will drop.  
All of this is not to say that bitcoin is a bad investment, to be clear, this is just a particularly bad argument for investing in bitcoins. Bitcoin does have inherent value for trading, but if you believe that the majority of bitcoins valuation is speculation on bitcoins valuation, you should recognize that that is a bubble (which seems like a pretty sound hypotheses to me given its meteoric rise in price which I would guess is primarily caused by a scarcity caused by people investing in bitcoin, but I don't know the actual transaction rates and thus demand for BTC as currency which is inherently valuable)";2;0;False;Valectar;dqkarz4;I hope James is doing well;7gla05;https://i.redd.it/h4ngqma643101.jpg
"It's a bit different with stocks tho:

a) the fact that a company doesn't pay a dividend now doesn't imply it won't tomorrow. It's not really relevant if it does, google pays no dividend and invests everything.

b) as a stock owner you own a % of a business and have a vote in its decisions";3;1;False;ep1939;dqk93r2;I hope James is doing well;7gla05;https://i.redd.it/h4ngqma643101.jpg

"That's dumb as hell. The reason companies don't need to pay out dividends is because the ownership of the share represents incorporates the dividends.

Let's say you own 1% of Company A. Company A has assets worth $100,000 and your share is valued at $1,000 (this is a super simple example). If Company A has revenues of $1,000 then they could give each of their 100 shareholders $10 and continue to be worth $100,000. That's a dividend. But if they don't declare the dividend then they now have assets of $101,000, and you still own 1% of the company. Your share is now worth $1,010. You can simply sell 1% of your share and give yourself an effective dividend, getting your $10 and keeping your holdings steady at $1,000.

When you buy stocks you're buying a share of ownership in an enterprise, ideally a successful one. When it succeeds it doesn't matter whether they give you cash or whether they roll that cash back into the company, you own a share of that cash anyway.

It's nothing to do with Greater Fool Theory. Netflix has never paid dividends but if you were to offer to pay a Netflix shareholder twice what he paid for his shares five years ago you would not be a greater fool. The value of the underlying asset has changed therefore the value of ownership of that asset through shares has changed.";73;6;False;Baron-of-bad-news;dqk8nxh;I hope James is doing well;7gla05;https://i.redd.it/h4ngqma643101.jpg

"That question is dependent upon how quickly you need the transaction to be moved from the mempool to the blockchain, or how fast the transaction needs to be on the blockchain ledger. The higher the fee the faster it will be mined onto the blockchain. If I needed to send my mom $100 right now and I decided to do it in Bitcoin, but she is okay with it being in her wallet by 6pm tonight, and it is currently almost 3pm where I am. Currently the blockchain is averaging 8.43 minutes per block. This means between now and 6pm there will be roughly 21 blocks mined that my transaction could go on. Thus, I could probably put a $1.50 fee on the transaction and it would be in her wallet by 6pm at the latest. If I needed to get a transaction through instantly, or on the very next mined block, it would be around $4. This would mean the money would be in her wallet and usable after about 8.23 minutes or whenever the next block is mined.  
  
However, the $4 fee is also during a time right now where Bitcoin price has skyrocketed so A LOT of transactions are occurring right now. During a time in which BTC is relatively stable (respective to BTC volatility) the fee could be as low as $1 to be included in the next block.  Currently BTC is working on a way to lower these fees even more so that you would be able to send a transaction for $0.25 that would be included in the next few blocks.

"> Let's say you own 1% of Company A. Company A has assets worth $100,000 and your share is valued at $1,000 (this is a super simple example).

This is an extremely naive way to value a company. It only makes sense to consider an asset-based approach in a narrow set of circumstances. It certainly doesn't make sense to use it in the Netflix example you give later. 

When would a shareholder expect to get paid out in your scenario? If it's any time before the company goes out of business, then we're back to the greater fool, right? If it is when the company stops operations, where do you think shareholders stand in line when liquidation occurs? No way shareholders get anything close to what they were expecting.

"True story... Literally this exact thing happened to me, but not in the context of bitcoin. I have an ex, started dating after I came back from a Mormon mission for a couple years in South Africa, so I was 22 years old at the time. We even got engaged after about 10 months of dating. Then, 2 months into the engagement, she cheats on me and says, ""I just want someone with more ambition I guess. You're just a programmer. Sorry."" Knowing her, what this really meant was she thought I was too much of a computer geek, my Computer Science degree I was enrolled in (and molecular and cellular biology double major) was not going to make as much money as a ""business"" guy, of what she kept telling me I should really be doing.

Well that was it. Queue some years later, I finish grad school, I am working solidly in computational biology, I'm published, I'm making 6 figures, and my position at my company is Chief Technology Officer (CTO) on my LinkedIn, and she messages me saying BS like we should catch up, she's in town, she'd love to see me and then trying to throw in little memories of old times. Note, I am married now with kids and she is married with a kid, and she hasn't talked to me in years but has the balls to say and I quote, roughly, ""Things are pretty rough. [Name of husband] and I haven't been getting along, and he got diagnosed with cancer and I have been having a hard time with it. He doesn't seem interested in going for promotions anymore at work. I am so impressed with how well you are doing. You are so smart and funny. Want to catch up? You can call me at [X] time as my husband won't be home then.""

Somehow she thought that would make me want to call her lol. Ya, I did not ever meet up with her since, nor did I care to, and she has reached out at least half a dozen times over the last few years. Oh and ya, she doesn't work and doesn't like working. My wife now complains that she doesn't work enough, even though she could stay at home. Who sounds like the person I'd rather be with? lol

If that would be how you would play it, then it would only harm your reputation an integrity. You are already in a better spot, so why are you bothered still by small little problems. The only thing this does is shows your insecurities.

Well, when I came back to the US, she was my first serious relationship and it accelerated fast so I ignored all the red flags.

It is more secure than any 3rd party bank, it is transferable, fungible, and does not need a 3rd trusted party to manage. That's it's current value. It's value as a currency will come, as the devs are working very hard to get scaling under control, and other upgrades. This is 1994 internet. You couldn't send photos in email when email first came out, doesn't mean email will always stay like that. same thing goes for bitcoin.

"Copy Paste from somewhere else.:

If you are new to Bitcoin and wondering why it's so valuable, please read this:

Bitcoin’s value derives from its current real uses (mainly for money transfers and remittances) its limited supply and scarcity (store of value) and its many potential uses. Also, behind the curtains there is a huge growth in the bitcoin ecosystem development that a regular folk can't see because it's ignored by the media.
> 
> If you buy for day trading you may lose money, but if you hold long term, it has been proven you get nice ROI. And bitcoin has barely started, think of the Internet/email in the 90's. A decentralized technology that has a valuable use it's not going to disappear, even if a few tyrannical governments try to ""ban"" it.

There is a limit of 21 million bitcoins (divisible into smaller units). ""Backed by Government"" money is not backed by anything and is infinitely printed at will by Central Banks.

It's a currency, with a physical amount of coins available, that have to have actual labor (computer labor) in the process of retrieving them. This first part gives them their value. The second part is our acceptance of them as a currency, making them valuable.;2;0;False;Raydonman;dqk4qlx;I hope James is doing well;7gla05;https://i.redd.it/h4ngqma643101.jpg
"Bitcoin is a digital currency you can use on sites like Overstock.com, Microsoft digital store, Steam (for games), Newegg for computer parts, some other sites and I think a few Subway franchise stores accept it, at least one that I've heard of.

It's a currency where you don't need a middle-man to send or receive. Where most banks will lock down your account if you buy from certain services they don't like, the Bitcoin network doesn't give a shit.

Where fiat (US dollars, euros, etc.) is controlled by a central bank, and they can decide whether a purchase is valid/invalid based on how they feel, Bitcoin is decentralized and transactions are verified using math. As long as 1+1=2, the transaction is valid. (Not entirely exact, but gets the point across hopefully)

You can buy Bitcoin from sites like Coinbase, and use the Bitcoin to pay for it. You can make money from it when the price rises. Holding Bitcoin doesn't get taxed. Selling Bitcoin for profit (or even loss) is taxed.

"I'm not a 100% clear what you're trying to argue but you're deluded if you think there is intrinsic value in bitcoin. A currency derives value from its ability to act as a means of exchange and because of (or occasionally in spite of) the economic policies that back it up. e.g. inflation targets. It is otherwise useless.

Gold has industrial and cosmetic applications and is relatively rare/expensive to extract for those uses, same as platinum, palladium and other metals. If you're looking for the ""new"" gold you'd be better investing in Helium-3 which we need a lot of but it is increasingly scarce.

Bitcoin - well blockchain - is an interesting tech that has a lot of use, but it is the concept of blockchain that is being used and developed in industry not bitcoin. BTC is proving only that the tech scales (kind of) but should a government of global consortia back a crypto then for mass adoption that'd probably win.

It's worth it. I put in $100 my junior year of high school in 2013 when it was at $1,200 and a week later it crashed. I got mad and forgot about it and a few years later my friend reminded me about bitcoin and I was astonished to find it was worth over 5,000/btc.

Exchanges have internal databases in order to avoid paying transaction fees for every operation and because it's much faster and convenient, so these transactions can't be counted in the total. A transaction is only counted when it's recorded on the blockchain and for this to happen, the buyer has to transfer the bitcoins he/she purchased into his/her own wallet.

"The fees confuse me so far, is there a minimum fee on each transaction? On my first transaction I bought $20 of bitcoin and it charged me a $1.49, which isn't exactly 1.9% of $20.

Bitcoin is in a league of its own. Its network is tremendously larger than any other cryptocurrency. It has much more vendors willing to accept it than any other cryptocurrency. Its brand is very powerful. Most people don't know what a bitcoin is, but infinitely more people know about bitcoin than about the second biggest cryptocurrency.

We indeed can't differentiate between transactions for goods and services and transactions to exchange bitcoins. The total volume transacted outside of internal transactions at exchanges in the past 24 hours is in excess of 12 billion dollars. Bitcoin as a currency is a secondary use case currently, but this will change once the Lightning Network is implemented, allowing for near instantaneous and extremely cheap transactions. I think the biggest use case currently is an international store of value that's impossible to confiscate or steal if the necessary precautions are taken and that can be carried everywhere with you simply by remembering 12 words. That's incredibly innovative. I hope that it will become a practical currency as soon as possible, but we can't expect a stable price while we're in the adoption phase and while the price is being discovered.;2;1;False;Exotemporal;dqjl7hl;BTC dropping due to lack of quality 11k memes.

Almost every currency has a scaling issue at the moment but it's because excitement is building rapidly and the infrastructure is struggling to keep pace. The currencies that overcome these issues (the ones with strong developers and goals) will be more favored than other coins.

Don't be silly. I spent over 100 bitcoins on goods and services. Buying other cryptocurrencies isn't exactly using bitcoin as a currency. He asked if he should divest in an another cryptocurrency because he wasn't comfortable with today's fluctuations and I told him that he shouldn't, not that he should never spend his bitcoins. Moreover, bitcoin doesn't have to be used as a currency to succeed. Bitcoin is what the users make of it. It's been going strong for 9 years now. When the Lightning Network finally gets implemented, we'll have near instantaneous transactions for extremely low fees.

"It's just gambling at this point. If you have 3k you don't need and enjoy gambling on coins more than sports or penny stocks then go for it.

Any coin on the market could easily be worth double or half what it is now in 6 months.

If you actually want to invest your money then you need a diversified portfolio of which a small percentage can be in high-risk high-reward assets like cryptocurrency.

If your dream is to become a millionaire off a 3k investment then you can't gamble on established coins like bitcoin.

Bitcoin has gone from 6 cents to 11k. It's literally impossible for bitcoin to see that kind of rise again, because it would have to hit 2 billion a coin, and that would make the market cap many times more than all wealth on earth.

Or the myspace of social media, or the Netscape Navigator of web browsers, or the Nokia of phones?

Being first to market, and even being market leader is not enough to secure monopoly position in perpetuity, especially in a fast moving innovative sector like technology.

Myspace lost out to Facebook just by having a slightly worse design. It's not like Myspace was fundamentally broken and Facebook came up with a radical improvement, and yet it still lost out even with a massive headstart and network advantage.

Bitcoin is far from being a functional currency yet, and has dozens of competitors based on exactly the same technology. I would be amazed if it was still market leader in 10 years time.

He asked if there's a better cryptocurrency than bitcoin right now. This was just a small dip, we're used to them and it doesn't require any action. Bitcoin has tremendously more computational power securing the network than any other cryptocurrency. No one is claiming to know if bitcoin will still be the gold standard of cryptocurrencies in 20 years, but right now it's in a league of its own and the other cryptocurrencies are tied to what happens to bitcoin. Bitcoin has also been much more peer reviewed and tested than any other cryptocurrency and it has been working for 9 years.

"Bitcoin is an asset which has never existed before.

It is similar to gold.
Supply is finite.
Takes effort and resources to produce.
Functions as a store of value.
Can be used to facilitate commerce.

On this last point, gold isn't widely used anymore, but it once was.

Gold has serious drawbacks. 
Its heavy.
If you want to pay someone in gold you have to do it in person which could be dangerous if they are some rando.  Doing it remotely requires secure transport and some way to guarantee payment.

So here comes bitcoin, a deflationary asset like gold, with the liquidity of credit cards, no dependence on a third party, the ability to transact globally and some privacy (not enough which is one issue with bitcoin).  

The financial sector is having a problem grokking the potential and since its growing so fast, the only other scenario that seems close to what we are seeing are the many many bubbles we have seen over the course of human history.  So people who aren't visionaries are dismissive calling bitcoin tulips and bubbles and claiming every correction is a sign that bitcoin is doomed.

You are absolutely right about mining being an energy suck and the arms race going on can't continue.  I am not sure how that is going to ultimately get resolved.

On the subject of consumer surplus.  There are only 16 million bitcoin in existence.  Of those, probably 4 million are lost, in wallets that have no private keys,  or are otherwise not in circulation.  that leaves 12 million coins in supply.  Coinbase at last report has some 10 million users.  There's barely enough supply for all of coinbase's users to have 1 each.  Demand is through the roof and every dip is seen as a sale.

This isn't a bubble, its the beginning of a [technology adoption curve](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_adoption_life_cycle) and things are going to start moving very quickly over the next 24 to 36 months.

edit to change ""in the next 24 to 36 months"" to ""over the next"" because momentum is already building.

"This is a fallacy. If energy costs fall with the introduction of cheap renewables, this will actually cause more energy to be devoted to Bitcoin mining (giving the same amount of overall expenditure).

Miners will expend as much energy as is profitable to mine a Bitcoin. If the price of Bitcoin is $10,000 then miners will find it profitable to spend just below $10,000 to mine one. If the the cost of energy falls by a factor of 10 they will just expend 10 times the energy but still the same amount of money overall.

"> So people who aren't visionaries are dismissive calling bitcoin tulips and bubbles and claiming every correction is a sign that bitcoin is doomed.

I remember when they called it a scam and a ponzi scheme and when every dip was a sign of the impending collapse of bitcoin where it would collapse to $0.00 value and you would loose everything! lol

"**Technology adoption life cycle**

The technology adoption lifecycle is a sociological model that describes the adoption or acceptance of a new product or innovation, according to the demographic and psychological characteristics of defined adopter groups. The process of adoption over time is typically illustrated as a classical normal distribution or ""bell curve"". The model indicates that the first group of people to use a new product is called ""innovators"", followed by ""early adopters"". Next come the early majority and late majority, and the last group to eventually adopt a product are called ""phobics."" Phobics use the cloud without knowing they are doing.

Bitcoin is a list of transactions shared on a very large network of computers. Your bitcoins are attached to a private cryptographic key which allows you to send said bitcoins to a bitcoin address. The bitcoin network, a decentralized network anyone can participate in, uses a large amount of computational power to verify the validity of transactions and mine new bitcoins by solving a difficult cryptographic problem.

"Supply & Demand, plain and simple.

Price goes up when demand outweighs supply (lots of people trying to enter the market.) Price goes down when supply outweighs demand (some whale/lots of people decide to cash out of their purchases or sell their mined coins for cash.)

The difference with Bitcoin is everything is exaggerated. Because there are so many people who are in to make a quick buck, they emphasize these price swings with excitement in both directions. There is overreaction to price increases, causing massive FOMO.

When things start going down, lots of people panic, and unfortunately make the mistake of selling. This increases supply further and reduces the price further. There are only so many stupid people though, and only so many people who want to cash out, so eventually the selling stops, people who understand investing or Bitcoin buy back in during massive drops which corrects the price.

Quick back of the envelope calculation for me though. World populatoin is $7B. Let's say 5% of the world uses bitcoin. That's $350M. Let's say each of those 5% want $1000 worth of bitcoin on average.

With 21M coins, that implies a valuation of about $16,667 per coin. And that doesn't count coins that are lost forever via satoshi or otherwise.
