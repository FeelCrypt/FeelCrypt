"New bitcoin issued is halved so the supply is effectively reduced relative to current bitcoin “inflation”.

This seems to put pressure on the supply to meet the demand and you see an increase in unit price over the months after halving.

You see a fairly moderate price increase and this seems to raise awareness of bitcoin which increases demand and then things have historically moved exponentially up in a self full-filling way.

You end up with a couple of new all time highs and higher lows. Each halving cycle, the exponential growth is decreased relative to the last cycle.

"Does lightning strike from the sky down, or the ground up?

The answer is both. Cloud-to-ground lightning comes from the sky down, but the part you see comes from the ground up. A typical cloud-to-ground flash lowers a path of negative electricity (that we cannot see) towards the ground in a series of spurts. Objects on the ground generally have a positive charge. Since opposites attract, an upward streamer is sent out from the object about to be struck. When these two paths meet, a return stroke zips back up to the sky. It is the return stroke that produces the visible flash, but it all happens so fast - in about one-millionth of a second - so the human eye doesn't see the actual formation of the stroke.";9;0;False;Vol_Har;ffczrz2;A sign we are about to see a pump.;esvx33;https://i.redd.it/c0qc2uzh7kc41.jpg

Coinbase isn't really an exchange, it's a service.

Have you ever traveled internationally and seen the money change kiosks at the airport?  If I Google USD to Peso I see $1.00 USD is $18.77 Peso.  But if I go to money changer I won't get that amount.  I'd be able to buy Peso for maybe 1 USD to $18.40, or sell Peso at 19.05 Peso for 1 USD (the spread).  There might even be an additional 0.25% fee added on.

Coinbase is no different.  You don't get the raw exchange price if you buy on Coinbase.  You'd actually have to go to an actual market (like GDAX) and place a bid to get the ""real"" price.";1;0;False;Oracle_of_Knowledge;ffcxsaa;"Coinbase Ticker price not matching ""buy"" price";esvpjr;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/esvpjr/coinbase_ticker_price_not_matching_buy_price/

Reminder: Mt. Gox was the largest exchange at some point, it went bankrupt in February 2014. That's almost **6 years ago** now. Most customers still haven't seen a cent of the bitcoins they stored on this exchange, and they most likely never will see a satoshi of them either.

So if you want this to happen to you, you should keep leaving your funds on custodial exchanges. Every couple of month it happens to other exchanges for various reasons (hacks, exit scams, etc.), it's like playing russian roulette.

">  dollars do not exist outside of a digital computer.

Federal Reserve notes do not exist out side of a computer? Besides coins Federal Reserve notes is the only form of Dollars in existence. Everything else are claims and liabilities. 

> The dollar ALWAYS involves counter party risk because YOU cannot store them. 

Wrong, you can store your Dollars in your pocket, in a vault, in your basement aso. There are countless examples to store Dollars without any counter party risk.

> You can possess a federal reserve note, which is NOT a dollar.

Sorry, but this really a retarded claim. I would check the laws before making such statements. 

> If you want, you can make the argument that federal reserve notes are not really notes since they no longer say what they will pay you, and I will agree with you on that. But in that case, they are literally worthless because they do not even make good toilet paper. 
They used to have words on them to the effect of ""Pay to the bearer on demand x dollars, or Y silver, or z gold"". People could actually take those notes to a bank of the federal reserve system and get silver or gold instead. But as we all know you cannot do that anymore since the US is no longer on the gold or silver standard.

Its valuation and backing is a totally different story, it has nothing to do with the topic. 

> Why on earth would the federal reserve create a dollar that has no counter party involved? That is how they have control. The true purpose of the federal reserve banking system is to control nations and peoples through control over the money. All nations on the planet except for four have a federal reserve system. Do you really think that the federal reserve is going to help create a dollar that does not require a federal reserve? 

Different story, has nothing to do with the claim that a ""digital Dollar"" exists.

> That is bitcoin. You can store, send, receive bitcoin all day long for the rest of your life - no banking system on the planet required. Bitcoin makes banking as humankind has known it for the past 100 years obsolete.

I agree and that makes it unique, it doesn't require banking system. These so called ""digital Dollars"" can only exist with a bank, they mimic digital Dollars but they are not Dollars, just claims and liabilities. When you ignore the complexity, mechanics and details of the two-tier banking system, it gives the illusion of a ""digital Dollar"".

"And you just proved my point.

The only place dollars exist is electronically inside a **digital** computer at a bank or credit union.

Just like Bitcoin, dollars do not exist outside of a **digital** computer.

The dollar ALWAYS involves counter party risk because YOU cannot store them.  You must have someone else store them for you such as in the digital computer at a bank or credit union.  You can never possess a dollar.

You can possess a **federal reserve note**, which is NOT a dollar.  Pull a ""dollar"" out of your wallet and look at it and read it.  Across the top it says ""Federal Reserve Note"".  It is a debt, that is an IOU, (i.e. I Owe You).  It is a **promise** to pay you a dollar by the federal reserve.  If you hold that piece of fake money, then you are owed a dollar by the federal reserve.  If you want your dollar instead of the promise to pay you a dollar, then take it to a bank or credit union and deposit it into your account and they will store it for you in their digital computer.  If you want to see it, they will print out the account balance for you, or let you look at it on a digital screen (eg. $1).

If you want, you can make the argument that federal reserve notes are not really notes since they no longer say what they will pay you, and I will agree with you on that.  But in that case, they are literally worthless because they do not even make good toilet paper.  They used to have words on them to the effect of ""Pay to the bearer on demand x dollars, or Y silver, or z gold"".

That's not the only change. A digital Dollar would make banks obsolete for the most part. When everyone can hold digital Dollars with the Federal Reserve, then why use banks at all for transactions or storing money? Banks would run out of deposits and could not function anymore as credit creators. The only way a digital Dollar works is to cripple it, e.g. limit the amount a person can hold. Lagarde from the ECB did already propose this. Also, a negative interest rate can be deducted automatically to force people to hold digital Dollars in small amounts for a short time only.;3;1;False;bitsteiner;ffcog0m;US Digital Dollar backed by the Fed?;esv9sc;https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/23/davos-calls-for-a-us-digital-dollar-as-china-works-on-digital-yuan.html?__source=iosappshare%7Ccom.apple.UIKit.activity.CopyToPasteboard

And by protection do you mean it is more stable than an asset like crypto? Because I would agree with u there.;2;1;False;aleden28281;ffct182;This guy!;esund5;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/esund5/this_guy/
Central banks are still tied to the nations interests though, so they couldn’t necessarily get away with heavily manipulating gold prices like that. Also, what would even be the reason for them to dump a shitload of gold? I assumed that the reason they accumulated it was to fall back on something in case the currency becomes too volatile, no? In any case, bitcoin and other crypto’s have this same problem. Only 927 people own half of all bitcoins out there and as individual actors I would think that bitcoin would have a higher chance of being manipulated over gold since central banks more or less act in the interest of the government which indirectly acts in the interest of the people (although not all the time).;1;1;False;aleden28281;ffd17oi;This guy!;esund5;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/esund5/this_guy/

Well the thing to consider is that it has limited supply like bitcoin and the store of value aspect is important. Also, wouldn’t the fact that the amount of gold is inflated imply that the amount currently available is less than actually stated, thus when this is realized by the market the price would increase? I’m not certain how big of a problem that is in and of itself but the appeal is that it’s a stable asset and has been a good way to hedge against recessions and market crashes. The fact that nobody uses it for money isn’t important and hasn’t been for almost a century.;4;1;False;aleden28281;ffcqw7e;This guy!;esund5;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/esund5/this_guy/
IMHO it has not. If you look at Golds market cap (est. 8-10 trillion) and silvers market cap (est. 600-800 billion), and you compare that to bitcoins (150-180 billion) then there is still a lot of opportunity to grow. I think some look at the $8.5k price tag per bitcoin and deem it expensive but it doesn't paint the full picture.  Just like Apple's market cap is worth than Amazons even though Apple is$ 300 per share compared to Amazon at $1800 per share, context is important. There is 18 trillion dollars in collective arts, another 5 -8 trillion in car collections. This is still speculation, but I can see a world where some of that money from gold, silver, art and cars flow into bitcoin. I can also envision a world where some millennials (the largest cohort ever) decide that bitcoin is a better store of value compared to some of the previous generations.;1;1;False;Liucifer616;ffddjcd;This guy!;esund5;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/esund5/this_guy/

Sorry, I said obviously because, unfortunately, in the cities/places where I lived (UK and Italy) it's really crazy to trust mail to ship so valuable items. People steal everything. Receiving gold by mail is something out of this world.   
About the cost/fee for the transactions, I assumed that you have to pay something on the platform you use. My experience is only with Fineco (a big Italian bank) for stock quotes. You pay for every transaction, or you have different ""packages"" (like 100 operations free for 6 months or 50% discount for operations after the 50th, but not free). This costs are usually much more than 0.25% + 0.15% (buy ans sell) on Crypto exchanges markets. Over that, in Italy, you have to pay 27% on the earning you have from your market transaction (obviously no rembursement when you loose money). It's all automatically calculated by the bank trading platform. The same trading platform manage gold (but I never used this market), with the same rules (costs/fees).   
Maybe there are platforms without these costs/fees but I'm talking of something that is widely used, not a bad example. Also for the city, I'm talking about London, not a small unknown village.

Well I’m not sure that’s always the case w crypto though, I hear about it being stolen from exchanges all the time. Usually owners of gold don’t actually have the gold in their possession as it is kept in a vault with a lot of other gold. And proportionately to how much gold is kept in these vaults, I would think that the amount of money it costs to secure them would be relatively minute. In any case, for an individual owner of a small amount of gold I don’t think the costs of securing it would even affect you although I do not actually own gold myself. I invest into a Gold ETF instead as the price of it is derivative of gold anyway and it more or less accurately tracks it and moves in the same percentage increments.;1;1;False;aleden28281;ffd1vv4;This guy!;esund5;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/esund5/this_guy/
They can’t legally do that I believe. There are laws against manipulation like that, at least in the US. And gold has been rising in price since the 70s, ud think they would have already dumped it by now? Instead central banks have been accumulating gold since the start of the 20th century. So there’s no real reason for them to just dump all of it on regular investors, it’s more useful for them to keep it. Also, this doesn’t excuse that bitcoin has the same issue, with over 50% of the coins being held by less than a thousand people. So in terms of being manipulated, I still think gold wins this one.;1;1;False;aleden28281;ffd2nnt;This guy!;esund5;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/esund5/this_guy/
I don’t really see why both can’t be used. Crypto is vulnerable to cyber attacks and thefts as I read about exchanges having crypto stolen all the time whereas something like gold is better protected and I think would require a lot more effort to steal, unlike fiat money/cryptocurrency. And just because it isn’t used for money is not important, it’s role has changed beyond that. The fact remains that as a store of value, it is very stable compared to other asset classes. I’m not saying this can’t change in the future, but in our lifetimes and perhaps the next several lifetimes, gold will be around and an important investment for many people looking to attach their capital to something physically tangible that inherently has value due to its limited supply.;2;1;False;aleden28281;ffcut46;This guy!;esund5;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/esund5/this_guy/

If this were to infect take place, then maybe this would mean the price *should* go up, but you realize this happening would also mean that some people had 0 oz of gold in the bag and probably would cause a short term dip. Even if it behaved correctly and went up, people again are actually holding no gold so again huge loss. 

I am a firm (I guess *was firm*) believer in gold. It definitely has a track of thousands of years for its use as money. To me though we only used it because we had nothing better at the time. Today we no longer use it as a currency. We love gold but know it sucks as a currency. It's phasing out. It only hangs on with its major use-cases that we obviously value so much. 

I believe decentralized programmable is the new gold. It has the elements of gold's monetary properties and more, essentially turning gold back into *just* a previous metal.

He doesn’t like that crypto is getting more attention than gold, but personally I am long both. The more assets your portfolio is diversified in, the better. Having gold is always good because it will almost always go up if equities drop but won’t necessarily go down if equities go up, as evidenced by the run up it had the last 2 months which happened while equities were gaining. Crypto is more speculative for sure but having your holdings be in crypto, equities, bonds, gold and other commodities ensures that you are not overexposed to one particular catalyst that might negatively affect one asset class but not the rest.

"I am not sure exactly which exchanges support canadians, but you can try:

bitfinex, bitstamp, coinbase

You will need to do KYC no matter where you buy (using bank transfers etc) online. Usually submitting a photo of your ID and one or two other documents.

Getting set up is a pain. That's what puts you ahead of most other people if you do it now. Don't fret, it used to be harder.

Back when Mt Gox was the only exchange, you had to 

* register with mtgox

* register with dwolla

* Link your bank account with dwolla

* wait a week for them to make 2 small deposits, confirm amount

* Initiate bank transfer to dwolla, wait a week

* Once funds arrive at dwolla, transfer to mtgox, wait another week

* Once funds arrive at mtgox, make bitcoin purchase

You had to REALLY want to buy bitcoin back then. As it turns out, if you went through all that crap, you were richly rewarded as the price went up 1000x in a few years.

That dynamic is still happening today. It's not easy to buy bitcoin and IT NEVER WILL BE. The reason is that bitcoin is so superior, that whoever ends up with the bitcoin is at a huge advantage (because once you have it, no one can take it back). Therefore the other party (the exchange) needs to be very very careful in what/who they accept.

Edit: cash app makes it pretty darn easy, unfortunately I don't think it's available to canadians, but you should check.";2;1;False;jmw74;ffc92mf;I am a first time buyer overwhelmed with methods of buying in.

Because it's not accepted as payment. You're speaking in terms of a hopeful future, and I'm speaking in terms of today's reality. And this is the exact problem with having a currency that appreciates. People don't really want to spend it unless they absolutely have to, or they just can't hold out any longer on that nonessential thing that they want. Maybe this is a bad thing, maybe not.

>  You see, you're defeating your own argument.  

It honestly seems like you're agreeing with me on most points :) 

>No one defers consumption forever. At some point you buy a thing even though you know it'll be cheaper if you wait. 

This is only true for essential purchases, or for items that get so cheap as to be a trivial expenditure.

>Ergo, depreciating fiat is superfluous in a world with a liquid, appreciating store of value that possesses all the qualities of good money.

Maybe. Deflation (which is essentially equivalent to appreciating currency) is bad for currency, because it discourages economic activity:

I don't think we necessarily know what a world with only appreciating currency looks like. We can theorize, but we don't know for sure.

Sure. If you're doing this, then you're converting it to a different store of value (investment). This is done all of the time, and makes perfect sense.

Exactly correct. 

Store of value is a pre-requisite to being a currency.

"Typically, stores of value (gold, stocks, property, etc.) are not the same things you use to pay for stuff (currency - dollars, pounds, euros, etc.). You want stores of value to at least maintain value, if not increase in value. This is at odds with currency, which functions best when it loses a little value over time - encouraging spending rather than hoarding. Why spend something that will hopefully be worth more tomorrow? The ideal situation is that you keep the bulk of your holdings in a store of value and convert it to currency on an as-needed basis. That's inconvenient/impossible with some stores of value (property, and to a lesser extent gold and stocks), but very possible with something extremely liquid like BTC. The downside to BTC as compared to other stores of value like gold or property is that it's intangible and you need others to ""buy in"" for it to have any real value/utility.  It's pretty similar to holding a single stock, actually.";0;4;False;SnarkConfidant;ffc3bbb;Is Bitcoin trending towards a store of value rather than a payment platform?;est665;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/est665/is_bitcoin_trending_towards_a_store_of_value/

"I also had this risk in mind. However, there still are plenty of protestors who are severed from banking and those who hastily shifted to crypto in order to protect their funds, and firms who are already bold enough to help protesters and accept crypto. I am pretty sure that all major coordination channels of protesters are already infiltrated by police agents. So, if they wanted to raid some of the businesses, they would have found most of them already.  Even word-of-mouth is a very weak protection, when so many people are involved.

Bitcoin is still in the 'grey zone' in Hong Kong and they officially consider it a 'commodity', not a currency.  Moreover, If I get it right, you can absolutely legally book your Bitcoin income in either USD or HKD with a reference to Bitcoin's price at any liquid exchange at the moment of transaction.

Therefore, if Hong Kong authorities decide to persecute businesses accepting crypto, they would need to clarify its legal status first (and I doubt they are willing to do it at the moment). Same way, no one is banning or dismantling Bitcoin ATMs in Hong Kong so far.

"Most people don't understand money.  I'm suspicious that this is by design.  Even really smart people don't understand money - the history of money from barter to the first coins to gold-backed bank notes to fiat ""play money"".  How is today's money created?  When markets crash, where does all the money go?  How does fractional reserve lending work?  What is a central bank, what do they really do?

For example, a lot of people might tell you that the government prints money.  Okay.  They don't know that over 90 percent of all money exists only in digital form in centralized bank databases.  Most of the money these days has been created via computer keyboard, not printing press.

Fiat money is weak, at its best.  Most people have no clue about that.  The global financial system is build atop this flimsy fiat trash.

A few people become fabulously wealthy due to the creation of fiat currencies from thin air -- and they think everything is great and that it will just go on forever.  But it won't.

At the bottom end we have people struggling to get clean water, keep some of their children alive... we have refugees... we have people who have no wealth to protect, no money to buy into Bitcoin, even though in the long run Bitcoin is going to help alleviate a lot of the unnecessary suffering.

In the middle, we have people struggling to stay in the middle class and not slip into poverty.  Look at the French yellow vest protests.  Some of the middle class is waking up and realizing the truth, that central bankers are criminals, that inflation is theft.  Others still believe the lies that somehow ""printing"" even more fiat currency is going to fix problems, most of which have been caused by ""printing"" too much fiat in the first place.

Bitcoin is up against an entrenched system of evil.  Bitcoin is up against lies, and coordinated FUD flinging.  Bitcoin takes on massive fraud.  Bitcoin must break through decades of systematic brainwashing -- and it will, because:

* Bitcoin is good
* Bitcoin is based upon truth and fairness
* Bitcoin actually works
* Bitcoin leads to freedom
* The current global financial system, based up fiat money is doomed, with or without Bitcoin
* Bitcoin will be the ""lifeboats"" as the ""Titanic economy"" sinks into dark, icy waters";20;4;False;Mark_Bear;ffbxlx8;Crazy to consider that the amount of bitcoin holders in the world is still so low.;esspoh;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/esspoh/crazy_to_consider_that_the_amount_of_bitcoin/

"Keep in mind that the vast majority of millionaires aren't actually rich in the sense that they have tons of extra money. In addition, these aren't savvy tech millionaires. For most people with $1 million+ it is sitting in retirement accounts where they can't touch it for many years without significant penalties and crypto isn't an investment option for them. 

&#x200B;

TONS of people have a million+ and live relatively close to paycheck to paycheck from a practical point of view. Sure, they could stop their 401(k) purchases from each paycheck and buy bitcoin, but that is a very hard sell. I, for example, keep putting money into a 401(k) because my company matches it at over 100%. Even though I THINK BTC will go up a lot, it is really hard to turn down a 100% match into traditional investments that have a much longer history of good returns. And I love crypto. The average person would never even consider stopping a 100%+ match 401(k) buy in favor of an undeniably high risk BTC buy. 

&#x200B;

So, I put most of my investment money into 401(k), and some of my 'extra' money into Bitcoin. If BTC goes to $1 Million someday, I'll wish I did more.

We live in a fairly large metropolitan area, so I expected this meetup to be very large and well attended.  I was pleasantly surprised that it was small.

Also, many people that were in attendance were the forerunners in development of the lightning network and working in other spaces of making this technology user friendly.

Basically everyone who got caught up in the frenzy of 2017 and bought alt-coins has had their asses handed to them in spades.

"**Legality of bitcoin by country or territory**

The legal status of bitcoin (and related crypto instruments) varies substantially from state to state and is still undefined or changing in many of them. Whereas the majority of countries do not make the usage of bitcoin itself illegal, its status as money (or a commodity) varies, with differing regulatory implications.While some states have explicitly allowed its use and trade, others have banned or restricted it. Likewise, various government agencies, departments, and courts have classified bitcoins differently. While this article provides the legal status of bitcoin, regulations and bans that apply to this cryptocurrency likely extend to similar systems as well.

It's kind of confusing with all the people yelling about Coinbase but basically Coinbase has really high fees and fakes some of their statistics, so I would recommend taking it off Coinbase and onto a wallet like Electrum. Save your seed (the list of words you get from Electrum or any desktop wallet) physically (NEVER on a computer) because you can lose your computer and still have your Bitcoin if you have your seed. For purchases, use Binance, Kraken, really any other exchange. Keep in mind a lot of people in this sub are diehard Bitcoin fans so if you are planning to ever use fiat they will give advice for people that don't want to use fiat.

1: Pseudonymous founder who got out of the scene early on.

2: Equitable distribution - open for anyone to mine and receive coins.

3: Community driven support and technical contribution. This was baked in since Hal Finney, and Bitcoin still receives technical contributions from hundreds of the sharpest minds in the space.

4: A really compelling technical improvement. (I.e., solving digital scarcity through distributed consensus.)

"Most people stray into other cryptos, then come back to bitcoin as their understanding evolves. Other cryptos will market themselves as bigger and better versions of bitcoin with added features. But it's just that; marketing. They leave out the trade-offs they are making to gain user features that do not need to be in the base protocol, and can be built on higher layers on top of BTC. You will not understand much about cryptocurrency until you know exactly why bitcoin works. As always do your own research.

BTC is still seen (wrongly) as a wasteful energy-intensive system (it's actually worth all that energy and a better use of it than status quo systems currently in place).

The public doesn't understand Bitcoin yet and the press parrots the ""uses more energy than a country"" meme all the time. Musk cannot embrace it publicly until that myth is fully dissipated, or critics would call him a hypocrite.

"One form of direct democracy is:
**Deliberative democracy**; school of thought in political theory that claims that political decisions should be the product of fair and reasonable discussion and debate among citizens.

In deliberation, citizens exchange arguments and consider different claims that are designed to secure the public good. Through this conversation, citizens can come to an agreement about what procedure, action, or policy will best produce the public good. Deliberation is a necessary precondition for the legitimacy of democratic political decisions. **Rather than thinking of political decisions as the aggregate of citizens’ preferences, deliberative democracy claims that citizens should arrive at political decisions through reason and the collection of competing arguments and viewpoints. In other words, citizens’ preferences should be shaped by deliberation in advance of decision making, rather than by self-interest**. With respect to individual and collective citizen decision making, deliberative democracy shifts the emphasis from the outcome of the decision to the quality of the process.

"I would call myself a Musk fanatic. These are his major issues with Bitcoin:

1) It's anti-government. While he has a distaste for government, he is largely a government contractor, and needs governments to view him, very, very favorably or all his business go out of business.

The most blatant example is that the head of NASA spends a huge portion of NASA's budget on a private-venture, of which the head of NASA also runs, along with Jeff Bezos. Musk is providing the same service, but currently gets paid 50% less than the 'head of NASA's private-venture'. The head of NASA has even gone on to heavily discourage excitement over SpaceX and routinely emphasizes that 'SpaceX breaks things', as if that is all they do. Musk **didn't say shit** until the head of NASA started slamming SpaceX in the middle of their Starship reveal day - clearly to dampen public support - and even then, Musk tiptoed like it was on accident.

So Musk can not take any anti-government position, at this point.

2) It's computer oriented vs people oriented. Generically, Musk is against passive investing, speculating, etc... and instead believes people should have all their assets constantly leveraged into creating more business, etc... always extremely active investing, or business making.

This is good logic, but.. realistically the world needs passive assets, and Bitcoin is equally suitable to rural land, gold, or stock (for that matter). One could argue that with Stock, people make it go up faster if they work harder, etc... but I'd argue that the *general public* has little to no effect on this motivation. So *private-stock* sure, but publicly traded stock is about equally speculative as Bitcoin, with little the public regularly does to support said company, work, or product.

3) Competing industries. Musk was into Paypal, and his acquaintances are into money, at large - maybe one of them runs Stripe, I can not say... but Musk has competing interest, for sure.

But the anti-gov thing is the real kicker.

I do want to point out his points about Direct Democracy are good and valid, and about laws being overbearing. Not going to say Swiss Direct Democracy is perfect, or that Amer Rep Demo is out-dated, but there is probably some combo that makes the most sense, for the organization of public funds.

I'm a huge supporter of wide-spread political reform, and believe moves toward Direct Democracy are the right approach, and have written something of a paper about it.

*Some what related*, the BCH community is getting forced upon them a 12.5% of mining issuance tax, which will go to some centralized force. The election process, distribution of said funds, isn't even addressed, at all - and that is problem with *central planning* and so on.

It is much more straight-forward to discuss how to force a tax upon a people, and less profitable for all to discuss how to distribute it without ingratiating corruption.

The concept of 'paying Bitcoin activists' is good, but the practicalities of this are near impossible to achieve. ETH failed, and became corrupt. BCH will fail, but is starting from a stand-point of corruption, so they have less far to fall. And we have yet to see a government which produces the happiest and most successful people, at an increasing rate, but the Swiss Direct Democracy is the best we have so far.";9;2;False;Bitcoin1776;ffbh7p9;Yesterday Elon Musk talked Bitcoin!;eslxmd;https://youtu.be/NxmO_QuD4Do?t=5589

"What I attempted to say is: it doesn't relate or have one specific answer.

The PIN he describes is an extra security feature, specific to the particular 3rd party wallet software he's using. It is designed as an extra code someone must know to use his wallet on his phone. It exists only to make it more difficult for a stranger who grabs his phone, to spend his money.

Other software may use a password or PIN or similar too for security. It's designed to keep someone with access to a device, out of a wallet. It's not the same thing as a backup. Bitcoin itself doesn't have PINs, or user ID's, accounts, or passwords. However, any software company may create a wallet which uses one or more of those features for security/authentication. The details of that, and how it relates, completely depends on the specific wallet software, because it's up to them, it's arbitrary, it's not part of Bitcoin itself. In turn, the details of _what data_ you must back up also depends on your particular wallet software, because they all may work differently or store data differently.

If you imagine his wallet software as a physical briefcase or luggage containing important items... he backed up the little 3 digit lock code that really only keeps his acquaintances out of the briefcase. He didn't photocopy any of the valuable documents inside the briefcase, even though those were what mattered.";1;1;False;suchClouds;ffcx3kl;Old guy meets alien tech;eskvul;https://i.redd.it/ui1khywq8fc41.jpg

"Yes, exactly, 15 minutes makes Bitcoin completely unreasonable for any sort of retail scenario. It would be cost prohibitive to get that fast enough to use where people behind you are waiting.

As for mistypes. If you were going to pay for something and needed to send $1000 to someone, would you send a test transaction first? What is your threshold? I would not have to do that with a wire transfer, because both banks would be verifying everything.

It could be done with extra wrappers, but there's no standard. Seems like if there were a way to send an instant message/bill/order/transfer request to a Bitcoin address you could easily know. 99% of addresses don't have a private key holder, so even something as simple as a timed confirmed send request would go miles.

Sending to a person could go like this:
We both open our wallets. One if us scans the other or pastes in their address and types in the amount we want or the amount we want to send. Other person gets a prompt to send or receive that amount. If the other person doesn't get the request, it times out in 15 seconds. Additionally our apps could look up the address owner in a signed registry and some contact info shows up, an email address, a screen name, a seller name, real name, whatever.

Online shopping could go like this:
I go to place an order online. At check out I paste in my address. Seconds later on my app a payment request pops up signed by the website I'm using.

In a store:
At the kiosk my total is shown. It has an NFC scanner or a barcode scanner, so I open my app and press it to the NFC scanner. The kiosk gets my address and sends me the bill with some form of verification whether it's signed by their website certificate or it shows a human readable address hash that I can easily verify.

It's true, credit card numbers are bought and sold, but they have fraud protection. If there's ever a private key collision with a wallet, that's it, you can never get those coins back.

As technology changes credit card companies adapt, because it's their income. If a quantum computer were made tomorrow and broke all the credit card network private keys overnight, they'd probably recognize it very quickly and shut it all down within minutes. It would take the Bitcoin network much longer and there would be some major disruption. Presumably a mass selloff, because there's literally no way to keep your coins safe from a crypto vulnerability.

Either Eric made up the password and didn't give it to Peter (unlikely), or Peter made one up and immediately forgot it and didn't follow advice to write down the seed phrase as a backup.

Two ways. The code will open source and more importantly, by using BigchainDB, the asset data is immutable. Only the private key owner can update the ~~data~~  metadata (this distinction is important, as I am storing the bitcoin address as part of the asset, so it cannot be changed again). The private key is not stored, and given only once on alias creation. So basically if you lose the key, you can't update or change the alias again.;1;1;False;kiljoy001;ffat00q;If there were a service that made bitcoin address human friendly, would you use it?;eskoxf;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/eskoxf/if_there_were_a_service_that_made_bitcoin_address/
Thanks - I'll continue on my development. One of the things I wanted to also do is make it so that anyone could run a bigchaindb node and join, I'm not trying to make a walled-garden where only I would control everything. I haven't tried to replicate the user@domain like email, as then I would have to keep track of that as well, but again it's a good point. One possible way would be to give it an expiration date.

">How is my Bitcoin Core wallet going to send to your desired alias?

Well, what I'm building is an api based service, so the wallet would have to make a call to the service to create an alias. The back end storage is using BigchainDB, so the owner of the alias would have a public and private key to control the alias.

"I get the gist of what you are saying (you have a good point!), I initially thought it would be more useful to be able to update the bitcoin address, but the more I thought about it, I couldn't figure out a good way to preserve immutability aspect of storing the data via BigchainDB in order to prevent hijacking, as even if someone got the bigchaindb private key they would not be able to alter the asset data. If the address is update-able,  it just becomes like storing the data in a NoSQL database with extra steps.

As someone who worked with a web hosting company before, I see the appeal of doing it this way. The reasons why I haven't pursued it though is mainly because I think most people are not tech literate enough to handle this by themselves. Ideally, people would come to a website put in their info, and copy the bigchaindb private key somewhere safe if they want to update the alias at some other point in the future.

"If he opened the blockchain wallet in 2013, I believe that was before the blockchain wallet used an HD wallet architecture. So if this is true then the seed phrase may not recover all coins, unless his coins were somehow auto-migrated to a new (HD derived) address (but I don’t think they had a mechanism for this). 

So you may need to regain access to the blockchain account to recover the coins.

"For the majority, you're right. But, it's not that straightforward. Hear me out:

If you can **afford the repayments**, and make peace with the fact that the **investment could go to 0**, it is no technically no different than spending the money on a material good of the same value monthly.

E.g., say you go out to a nightclub once a week, spending $100. If you do that every weekend, it's \~$400 per month. Now, what if you're young and decide to take a punt on Bitcoin. You know it may fail, but you're okay with that because the upside is greater than the downside, and **you can afford the repayments** as part of your income/expenditure budget. So you take out a loan for the value of 1 BTC and buy 1 BTC. For the term of the loan, you replace your nightclub habit and instead use the money to pay off the loan. If you're wrong, then you took a calculated punt and the only downside is you forewent going to a club for 2-3 years. In 20 years, you're not gonna regret *not* going to a nightclub.

This is an absolutely fine approach, as long as all the conditions in bold are met and the plan is calculated sensibly. I agree that mindlessly accruing debt to buy a speculative investment is not a good idea, but the black/white **it's baaaaaad** is overly simplistic.";4;2;False;akajmj;ffbmvqz;"In 2030, there's going to be an r/askreddit question asking what you would tell yourself if you could speak with yourself from 10 years ago.

"I was actually considering getting a bank small business loan in early 2012 to start up a mining company (using the new FPGAs that were all the rage at the time) and quit my day job. I forgot exactly how much I was going to get, but the payment was going to be $350/month I think for five years.

Had I done it, I think I would have mined at least a few hundred BTC which I could have sold in early 2013 to cover the cost of the loan or in late 2013 I could have sold just a handful of them to cover the cost of the loan and kept the rest as payment.

Here is a template that you can use for writing to your congressional representative in support of the Virtual Currency Tax Fairness Act of 2020. Let's not give up before it even has a chance of passage. Your individual voice matters. Even if your representative doesn't read your email, their staff probably will, and helping to inform them is also important. Please feel welcome to adapt this language to fit your style.

""...

I write to you regarding the proposed bill entitled ""Virtual Currency Tax Fairness Act of 2020."" I am in full support of this bill and hope you choose to be as well. Currently, capital is being driven out of the United States into foreign jurisdictions because we have not adopted a friendly posture toward new blockchain and crypto technologies. To the contrary, multiple agencies of the U.S. have taken a relatively hostile posture toward the promise of these new and significant technologies. For example, the IRS requires that even the smallest personal transactions (e.g., buying a cup of coffee) of a citizen must be tracked and reported (i.e., tax basis and tax gain/loss). This is not a fair way to tax people, and indeed, it is a cruel form of taxation. A $200 exemption is already in place for gains due to foreign currency fluctuations. What this bill does is level the playing field for crypto-related personal transactions. The current market cap of crypto exceeds $200 billion. That is money just waiting to be tapped into by the U.S. economy. Either we make a friendly environment in this country so that those savings can be injected into our local economies, or instead, that wealth ends up being injected into overseas economies. Using crypto for purchases is a much more sustainable benefit to the U.S. compared to scalping tiny capital gains from crypto trades, and imposing an onerous record-keeping requirement on the citizenry, even for personal transactions. I urge you to do what is within your power to see this bill progress forward.

How do I prove that I had $200 or less in gains without keeping records of all my transactions?  

This doesn't help with the paperwork, ... it only help reduce taxes, ... 15% on $200 is a maximum of $30 in taxes saved.  Woooo hooo!!!!!

If you knew anything about economics you would know that miners create a demand subsidy to energy producers that make clean and cheap power due to miner's own incentives to chase the cheapest, most reliable forms of power (typically surplus hydroelectric). This incentivizes  the creation of more clean and cheap power production because power producers now have a source of reliable, non-intermittent use. This massively reduces the risks to power producers to expand power production. The producers want to continue to attract the consumers (miners) that make their expansion possible (cheap clean power), so they invest in more hydro/geothermal/nuclear/etc...;1;0;False;Sto1cNate;ffajyhg;Inside Bitcoin's Proof-of-Work / Waste 10-Minute Mining Lottery - Follow Along w/ Many Ready-to-Run Code Examples;esgnm9;https://github.com/openblockchains/awesome-blockchains/tree/master/bitcoin_proof_of_work.rb

"Please never call unpublished channels ""private"".

Unpublished channels leak your incoming and outgoing payments to the direct counterparty.  If you are engaged in economic activity with somebody on the Lightning network, and both of you use unpublished channels to nodes run by the same entity, or *hacked* by the same entity, then that entity knows of your economic activity and who paid whom what amount when.

If you have two or more published channels, any payment you yourself send or receive on your published channels, you can always pretend to have come from / go to somewhere else.  Thus, you should prefer having many published channels than a single unpublished channel.

Published and unpublished channels look the same onchain, and in general any 2-of-2 multisignature on the blockchain has a very high probability of being a channel, whether or not it is marked as ""published"", and blockchain analysis have a good chance of identifying unpublished channels once they are closed.

Finally, remember ""two can keep a secret if one of them is dead"", and every ""unpublished"" channel is known by at least two participants (you and the channel coutnerparty).  The counterparty might pretend it has not leaked your unpublished channel to anyone else, but you cannot verify that.

"We were discussing wealth, not money. Money is ""empty"", nonexistent, a figment of our current society, yes.

Wealth, however, is very real and an inseparable part of any human society.

Wealth is just a shorthand for ""abstract power that you can use to make other humans do what you want"".

In a capitalist society which uses money, someone who has a lot of money has a lot of wealth.

In an egalitarian, communist society which does not use money, someone who is friends with the head of the secret police has a lot of wealth.

In your post-scarcity economy, someone who can program the robots and set what they produce has a lot of wealth.

On a post-nuclear wasteland which does not use money, is not egalitarian and does not have miracle robots, the prepper family with a bunker and a million bullets is wealthier than the refugee family living in a tent.

Money is just a form of wealth intrinsic to our current society, yes. You can abolish this society and thus abolish money. But as long as you don't fundamentally change the human organism, there will ALWAYS be a form of wealth, and there will ALWAYS be inequal access to it.

Consequently, one has two choices. Either one accepts this fundamental truth, considers the forms of wealth that one's society can be expected to use, and amasses these. Currently, Bitcoin is an excellent choice for this.

Or, one can reject this fundamental truth and delude him/herself into thinking money and wealth isn't real. That's an interesting experiment.

It's exactly what you called it  circular and I am dead sure no law is backing the same  circular   in Kenya. I don't know what power the central bank has over the people but such failed capitalist institution does not make laws. Its duty is to remain a puppet institution to the empire and to put commercial banks in check.

What need is such a failed Pyramid Ponzi institution to tell people not to have their own Banks (BTC) in their Pockets  ?

The same need it does not have to tell people what to do with their money or how to spend it particularly when it's their hard earned money but not debt FIAT or even what to use as medium of exchange. The last time I checked there is still trade by barter which makes it convenient to circumvent a legal tender. That is to tell you the real source of money.( The people decide what they want to use as medium of exchange or store of value but not the Government deciding for them in such regard).

">  no law is backing the same circular in Kenya. I

Well, whether or not selling (and/or buying) bitcoin is considered a violation of the AML/KYC regulations (POCAMLA 2009) is not something established. Banks were ordered to not service any ""virtual currency"" company or individual nor any company or individual that engages in ""virtual currency"" activities.

So even if it was clear how exchanges could operate without violating that AML regulation, until the Central Bank removes its ""cease and desist"" order, no bank will serve you as an exchange (or any vendor or service your exchange is involved with). 

To date, there's been no prosecution of any company or individual for trading bitcoin, as far as I'm aware though.   There was some LocalBitcoins traders charged with aiding bank theft some years ago for selling bitcoin and accepting bank transfers that later were found to be involving stolen accounts,... the traders got first scammed, then charged with a crime.  But I don't remember if there was a trial or judgement, ... which probably means following investigation, the case against the traders was dropped.

The essence of the problem, in my opinion, is that the government cannot risk 1.) pissing off their future lenders (EU and UK banks, IMF, China), and 2.) easier methods for the terrorist group(s) operating in the region to receive outside funding.   Banning banks from working with exchanges and crypto companies, and banning exchanges from operating in the country helps to lessen the chances of those two risks I mentioned, ... at least as far as optics go.

So, where there's friction, the bitcoin ecosystem sees that as damage and routes around it.  P2P exchanges continue operating and growing ([Paxful has been breaking weekly volume records in Kenya](https://www.usefultulips.org/paxful_KES_Page.html)), and there are new on-ramps into (and off-ramps from) bitcoin being built (e.g., Akoin/BitMinutes/Trusted Agent Network) or already introduced (e.g., Zippie), as well as pseudo banks / parallel financial systems (e.g., M-Pesa, Loop, Chipper Cash, Eversend, etc.) there's so many paths for someone with funds in Kenya to obtain bitcoin, if they are motivated to look -- regardless of the Central Bank's ""cease & desist"" circular.";1;1;False;cointastical;ffbstrp;Localbitcoins.com mass NG,GH,PK,IR (e.t.c) Traders account block next level War on BTC traders ?;esc25u;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/esc25u/localbitcoinscom_mass_ngghpkir_etc_traders/
"You have said all these things and you are right but you are not getting the point about the reason why **Kenya is** not included in the names of those countries U.S instructed her **permanent puppet Brussel**s to enforce new EU measures..

**Enhanced due diligence process**

(The most racist phrase I have ever heard in my entire life, ever since I was born)...

LBC recently wrote the following(bellow) confirming what I wrote or shared above even before they released a note about it confirming what I initially speculated.

"" Customers residing or otherwise located in the following countries are required to have an **enhanced due diligence process**.

The countries are defined by EU commission: Afghanistan, American Samoa, The Bahamas, Botswana, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guam, Iraq, Libya, Nigeria, Pakistan, Panama, Puerto Rico, Samoa, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka, Syria, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, US Virgin Islands, Yemen.

The process to activate the account will be introduced in the near future. If you're not willing to wait for your account to be activated, you can withdraw your bitcoins by deleting your account.""

&#x200B;

They have gone further to making the list about 20 countries not even included in their racist  enhanced due diligence process statement. Do you know why **Kenya** is not on that list ?

&#x200B;

When you remember **Panama Papers** you should try to remember this attack too against specific countries listed by the puppet master. 20 countries perceived here as enhanced due diligence process needed to be done by LBC (A surrogate of the Empire financial hegemony).

&#x200B;

Now the main point.Kenya is a sold out territory Economically to the Anglozionist empire, they control your banks. The difference between Kenya banks and Nigerian banks is huge. We control our banks by our people by our laws and often time thee CBN do not do as the **WORLD bank/IMF dictates. (Kenya Does and the reason it's not included in targeted countries is because it's a permannt puppet state of the empire just like most of all the countries in the EU itself, A NATO colony)**

&#x200B;

However, Kenya is still far better than another sold out country economically, South Africa, whose people don't even have rights over their farmlands. It's that terrible.

I see this as only a political attack and Financial strangulation but guess what ? The world will move on without LBC and its  enhanced due diligence process. The vacume will immediately be filled by the local tech.

&#x200B;

This will just put other local Tech in Nigeria like Luno, Remitano, Binance to fill in the gap and also local BTC sellers like myself.

`bitcoin is considered a violation of the AML/KYC regulations`

Here we go again. When those big banks launder money abroad then this okay, normal but when someone that has worked hard to sponsor his or her family to study abroad is sending such money out to his our her daughter at a very cheap almost instant transfer, then it becomes Money laundering right ?

&#x200B;

**Lets even start by defining what Money laundering is ?**

Money laundering is hiding the identity of the source of money. That is it. I can send. 100,000,000,000,000 EURO (in any country's currency) to China or Russia right now if I have that amount of money in my account and registered to my name as the owner of that money. It's non of anyone's business to whom or whomever I decided to send that money to as long as I am not hiding the identity of the money or the source of the money. OKAY.

&#x200B;

**Now KYC.**

Know your customer. It's very simple just know your customer in case he pays you fraudulent money, you have his or her identity to track him down. I wont be so stupid not to know the customer I am sending 100,000,000,000,000 EURO  to or receiving from, so KYC is just normal customer to Business relationship thing.

&#x200B;

**Are we clear on this?**

For Central bank to issue a circular banning Crypto again is just baseless and besides how will they even know I am buying crypto currency ? That is it, BTC is revolutionary and CBN cannot just accept this new technology restoring the power back to the people instead of that of a few 1%.

&#x200B;

Sooner or later the EU will be in serious mess. Lets wait for it. The empire has been on  steady decline for over one and half decade now. With the Raise of China as the world Economic power and Russia as the World's military power house and Iran in the middle east.

"I don't even pretend to have any insight as to what the future looks like, but Kenya has immense amounts (in relative terms) of foreign currency debt, with many loans having contract terms remaining secret, per the loan agreement.   It's a serious mess already, and the direction things are headed is not good.

The best outcome for the people is to embrace the informal, as if there was no gov't.   Funding and operating businesses solely with cash and crypto -- no banks, minimal reporting / records compliance.

For instance, outside funding for Agrikaab projects can (and does) come from anywhere in the world.  These are like per-project businesses.  The investor doesn't get equity, but is paid a decent return from the project's gross revenues (e.g., like a revenue bond).  These type of endeavors could pop up left and right, and the gov't would find very little return in going after them like they do with formally organized entrepreneurial ventures.

This is the same issue with every country else and you know the funny thing ?

THe Debt $$$ is just being printed massively without anything backing the debt$$$ except war **(Their lies was finally revealed in 2008 selling of fake CDOs that lead to stealing of over $2trillion worldwide which then marked the end of Capitalism, mere Ponzi pyramid Scheme.

&#x200B;

Now, a country's wealth is determined by how much debt she owes. Such a failed economic system is on a time bomb just waiting patiently to explode then they borrow you another money again to pay debts (Like in the case of Greece and even the PIGS states i.e Portugal, Italy,Greece and SPain)..

&#x200B;

This is only prolonging the lifespan of the empire and when everything comes crashing. It will be more deadlier than it is now. Such Economic policy the world is already tired of the Dollar hegemony and people are looking for ways to dedolarize. **(BTC the savoir. At least any BTC you have access to the private keys is not DEBT)**

I have come to just one conclusion, ***DEBT is nothing but the modern day slavery***, to keep the masses poor and in check and always paying debt. So every dollar paper you see only represents DEBT (Slavery and blood of innocent people killed over the years of fighting endless war).

Well, as it says. You seem to not have enough space on your disk. Check all your disks with `df -BGB`. You can mount an external disk or device onto the correct location to expand space using the `mount` command. Or change the location you want to store bitcoin with the `-datadir` argument when starting bitcoin (but of course copy/move the data to that location first or it will start over from block 0).;1;0;False;jcoinner;ffaeumw;Problem while running my node;esafo8;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/esafo8/problem_while_running_my_node/

The difference is whether you control the coins or Coinbase does.  With the wallet, you control them and if you lose them they are gone.  They also cannot be taken away from you.  This is called non-custodial where coinbase or the provider does not have custody of the coins, you do.  With the Coinbase app, you don't have direct control of the coins because Coinbase has custody of them.  The value in your wallet is an abstract of your coins value, not a direct representation of the coins you are holding like the wallet app.;1;0;False;EnglishBulldog;ffb9bt7;Daily Discussion, January 22, 2020;es8du6;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/es8du6/daily_discussion_january_22_2020/

It has been well studied that punishment does not teach someone to not misbehave or commit crimes.

So your comment doesn't actually make sense.

The reason criminals tend to not be introspective, it's usually because they have some sort of trauma or abuse in their background that's causing them to act out the way they are.

So, if you really wanna make criminals better, punishing them isn't going to work. Addressing the trauma or the abuse that's making them act up, will.

It isn’t an indisputable fact that he hired people to carry out hits. It is quite disputable, charges in Maryland were dismissed with prejudice. Evidence that the defense was not allowed to question or call the first hand account of in for testimony. 

*Someone who the government believed was in the law enforcement investigation was selling information to DPR,"" Ulbricht's attorney Joshua Dratel told reporters at a press conference in his Wall Street offices in Manhattan. ""That person made a concerted effort to wipe that evidence from four pieces of [evidence], however there was a fifth piece he wasn't aware of.*

*Dratel says the discovery ""totally undermines the integrity of any of the digital evidence in the case."" Ulbricht's legal team has made a discovery demand in Maryland, where a case against Ulbricht is still pending and says it will file a motion if discovery isn't initiated by prosecutors there.*

"Well, I will start by saying that I have invested way more time in this case than any disinteresed reasonable person ought to. You could say I'm a little obsessed with the whole case. So, maybe I approach this whole thing from a different angle than most reasonable people. But there is significant evidence that Ross Ulbricht actually paid a lot of money in bitcoin to someone he thought was a hitman to kill people he thought were real. (In the end, the ""hitman"" turned out to be one of several profiles used by the same individual to scam bitcoins out of Ross; he was surprisingly good at it.)

You can start with the actual journal/log he had on his laptop where he discusses being blackmailed and that he hired someone to take care of it, and then later in the journal he notes that the blackmailer has been eliminated. I suppose one can believe that the journal/log was fabricated by the FBI and then a backup copy of it was planted on the thumb drive that was found in Ross's bedroom. And if that were the only bit of evidence, we might stop there.

But then we have the chatlogs from his laptop that show his conversastions (through Pidgin, IIRC) with the person (redandwhite) he thought was a hitman. You can read him discuss the blackmailer and ask the guy to have the blackmailer killed, and even negotiates the price of the hit. After that first hit, Ross pays for four additional hits with the same guy. This corroborates the journal/log entries. So, if you believe the journal/logs were fabricated, you have to believe the Feds also created fake Pidgin chatlogs on his laptop and backup thumb drive.

Aside from his laptop, there is also evidence from the server that was seized in Iceland. From there, you can see chatlogs between DPR (Ross) and the fake hitman (redandwhite) through the Silk Road messaging system. And, again, you would find a lot of the same information -- discussion of the blackmailer and how to handle him. So, in addition to fabricating evidence and planting it on his laptop and backup thumb drive, you have to believe they fabricated evidence and planted it on the server as well.

Finally you have the actual bitcoin transactions in the blockchain. There you will find bitcoin transactions at roughly the times the hits were comissioned for roughly the amounts negotiated, transferred from an account associated with DPR to another account which belonged to redandwhite. So, in addition to believing that all of the evidence on the laptop and server were fabricated, you have to believe the blockchain was manipulated as well, or that DPR paid many hundreds of thousands of dollars to a mystery account coincidentally at the same time the government alleges he tried to pay for hits.

And it turns out that redandwhite is likely a man named James Ellingson. When the feds busted Silk Road, they kept a close eye on the various bitcoin accounts associated with the site. And as people have tried to cash out their bitcoins over the years, the feds have swooped in to arrest them. James Ellingson is a Canadian man arrested last year on money laundering charges connected to his Silk Road activity, and it is very likely that he was the person who scammed Ross into paying for all of those hits.

So, the evidence is out there. It's all public and accessible for people like me who are obsessed enough with the case to look for it. It is very, very difficult to explain it all away.";1;1;False;nycguychelsea;ffculvr;A photo and message from Ross Ulbricht for the new year;erxgd7;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/erxgd7/a_photo_and_message_from_ross_ulbricht_for_the/

I looked into it quite deeply a few years ago and have indeed seen those BTC transactions but hadn't seen the James Ellingson development. Will look into that.

 Really playing devil's advocate here: I don't think they would have to ""manipulate the blockchain"". Just find a transaction from the Silk Road wallet (that could be for anything) and then weave a story that incorporates those payments in it and then plant those on DPR's devices and the server.

"Murder-for-hire is addressed by statute in federal code 18 U.S.C. § 1958, which reads:

>Whoever ... uses or causes another (including the intended victim) to use the mail or any facility of interstate or foreign commerce, with intent that a murder be committed in violation of the laws of any State or the United States ... as consideration for a promise or agreement to pay anything of pecuniary value, or who conspires to do so, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for not more than ten years, or both;  and if personal injury results, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for not more than twenty years, or both;  and if death results, shall be punished by death or life imprisonment, or shall be fined not more than $250,000, or both.

The statute is much longer, but I edited out parts that don't apply to Ross. The point is that the act of paying somone with the intent that a murder be committed is itself a crime, whether the intended victim is real or not. And that crime is punishable by 10 years and a fine. If there is a real victim and that victim is injured, the penalty increases to 20 years and a fine. And if a death results from the plot, the penalty increases to life or death and a considerable fine.

So, even if Ross is guilty of murder-for-hire -- and I personally believe he is -- that alone doesn't really justify the sentence he received. I'm stuck between wanting to help right a wrongful sentence, but finding the whole freeross victimhood and conspiracy mongering too icky to support.";1;1;False;nycguychelsea;ffapcrk;A photo and message from Ross Ulbricht for the new year;erxgd7;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/erxgd7/a_photo_and_message_from_ross_ulbricht_for_the/

"My opinion is the only reason you think this, is because you suffer from mental illness/disturbance, understandably after what you experienced in your childhood. The point is that mental illness is not permanent; it’s merely a problem, and problems have solutions. It can be fixed. If you don’t understand this, then blame your mental illness. But trust me when I say it, as I don’t suffer from mental illness and have a clear mind. So follow what I advised in the post, even if you don’t believe it, and you will improve.

"Don’t take what u/PopularDevice says seriously, as he appears to be merely scum based on this conversation he is having with you. He’s insecure himself, a sadist, unhappy inside, and/or otherwise a loser.

Based on what I’ve observed from a brief perusal of your posting history, I cannot personally relate to anything, but I can still posit that you are dealing with severe childhood trauma (mental illness, as you yourself seem to be aware) + perhaps further negative effects from your abuse of drugs and alcohol.

1. Immediately ending your substance abuse would be very helpful, as well as embarking on incorporating healthy lifestyle behaviors (diet, exercise, meditation, yoga, perhaps sauna if you can access it to help detoxify any toxins accumulated in your system over time). — Healthy lifestyle behaviors can attack the problem from the area of helping your brain heal itself and function more normally. Negative thoughts only compound and make the problem worse, so you must end that pattern.

2. Helpful for your motivation can be this app — https://apps.apple.com/us/app/motivate-daily-motivation/id1068278823 — browse its videos and quotes and such. I personally found it helpful in achieving high success, as you learn how success and achieving goals is actually done... vs. how most perceive it to be due to just luck or talent alone. Example video by a previously homeless person: https://youtube.com/watch?v=6vuetQSwFW8

3. Also with motivation, the concept of how reality works with goal progress, and the concept of how becoming just 1% better each day has dramatic results after not too long, are both very useful: https://imgur.com/download/cNukAjK/

4. You can perhaps treat yourself through Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) — google it — or via a professional if you can find one, which is an intellectual way of looking at and resolving mental issues... especially since you almost unbelievably seem quite intelligent (you can be an autodidact, learn anything yourself), despite all the abuse you suffered + how you hurt yourself through substance abuse.

5. You can also try healing through your relationship with your girlfriend, if I’m right in thinking it is healthy. Simply spending time with her, and conversing in a productive manner to try to understand your past, and parse it in a productive way that lets you accept it and move on, could be very helpful, as it’s a form of support and can help you learn that you do have support structure in the world (and unlearn the idea that you are a worthless failure imparted from your parents).

6. You can also make it your number one goal to find a way to get treatment from a professional. This doesn’t just mean a traditional mental health clinic in an office, it can also mean utilizing services available on the Internet. The Internet has almost all knowledge known to humans, and startups making mental health treatment more widely available are everywhere these days.

Taking a fatalist philosophy is a dead end. To get out of your hole, you must work as hard as possible to implement a system/process like I’ve described. Treat your time as valuable and scarce, don’t waste it on pointless Internet surfing, use the Internet to help fix your situation.

From whatever I know of health and science, what I have written in this post will be helpful and have real results. But, you must be able to take charge of your life and take responsibility for everything that happens from now on (without using your unfortunate past to make excuses). Take true ownership of life with discipline. Be grateful you were born with a decent intelligence and still have it, as this will help you achieve what you want.

Remember in the age of the Internet, you don’t need traditional employment to make money... so whatever your concerns are in that respect, they probably don’t need to matter. Learn any skill you want on the Internet, and use it!";1;1;False;eragmus;ffbfiti;Who else lives like me?;erj4ff;https://i.redd.it/5uyptx82uzb41.jpg
