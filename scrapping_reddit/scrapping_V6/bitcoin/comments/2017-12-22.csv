This is assuming the situation doesn't change, which it 100% will change.  Hopefully newer addons to bitcoin will ease the burden.  However, even if the worst case scenario happens and bitcoin drops dramatically, that means that fewer people will be using it and the fees will go down, allowing you to move your (now worth less than before) coins.

Not true. In this very moment right now - we all have an unfathomable variety of different choices in front of us. 

So many in fact, that many of us make similar choices seemingly ad finitum, but over time we all learn and grow in our own way - especially in terms of decision making.

That incalculable number of choices are decided by us, countless of times per minute. Many, the vast majority in fact, pass us by subconsciously while a small percentage are within our average conscious awareness, if only for a moment. 

It is in beginning with what you are consciously aware of as a decision, and infusing it with complete integrity and great wisdom. 

This can be any decision, such as eating some fresh broccoli instead of M&Ms, or applying yourself fully at work; rather than giving only a minimum effort, be as completely present with your activity while you are there. Or at least, as close as you can manage!

"A transaction is generally the movement of a coin or fraction of a coin from one location to another.

This movement is recorded on the chain in blocks of 1MB in total size.

Roughly every 10 minutes a block is added to the chain with those transactions in it.

3500ish per 10 mins.

The TX (transactions) have fees (small portions) attached and the miners choose which TXs get into the next block. They choose the ones with higher fees.

Right now if no one makes a new TX for the next 4 days then all the TXs will be completed.

It used to take under an hour then a few hours became the norm then 1/2 a day. Now fees keep rising to be able to have a decent chance to get a fast TX and the waits go up and up and up.

If you have $30 in bitcoin, you may never be able to move it due to the fees. If the fees become closer to $100 then you won't be able to spend or move that either.

Every single solution that's been proposed so far is basically a workaround to the fundamental limits of the Bitcoin blockchain, not a solution to those limits. Basically, the developers all accept that those limits aren't going to be lifted any time soon, and that workarounds are the only option.

Plus, making significant changes to Bitcoin itself is hugely problematic because it's so heavily used and has no formal governance. It's similar to the reason that most of the US last mile broadband infrastructure is so slow compared to many other countries - because it was one of the first movers, it's hard to change now.

Another thing that's been predicted for years is that Bitcoin won't be the final cryptocurrency. The best solution to these problems will probably take the form of a different blockchain, but the one that's so obviously better than Bitcoin and doesn't have its own set of fundamental limitations hasn't been invented yet.

"Well, you could start with [this list](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block_size_limit_controversy#Arguments_in_opposition_to_increasing_the_blocksize). Or get a sense of the broader issues from [General Block Size Increase Theory](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability_FAQ#General_Block_Size_Increase_Theory). 

Part of the problem is that the effects on the network can't be fully predicted, such as the effect on the number of full nodes, etc. Addressing the issue essentially requires experimenting on the Bitcoin community, and as I've already alluded to, some people are naturally conservative about that.

These kinds of factors are what I was getting at when I wrote that because the available solutions don't address the fundamental limitations, it ""makes it much more difficult to get consensus about a fix."" It's not just a binary question of increasing the block size or not - it's a question of which direction to go in a much larger possibility space.

If you step back and look at it dispassionately, it could make a lot of sense to force a more comprehensive solution now than postpone scaling problems to when adoption is even more widespread and major changes will be even more difficult.

In situations like this, it's pretty common for uncoordinated groups of people to wait until the problems are so bad that a contentious fix is better than the status quo even for the people who were originally against it. 

That happens, as I've pointed out, because of a lack of true solutions to the problem, the fact that changes need to be made to a large, actively used network, and the lack of formal governance.

"Sorry you felt it was condescending, I was just stating my qualifications. I have a degree in economics. 

Once again economics is not an exact science. I can't tell you with certainty where bitcoin is going to peak and when the bubble is going to burst because that's not something I can predict. It's almost totally dependent on the whales and since I can't read their minds I don't know when they will sell. 

What I can tell you with certainty is that the value of bitcoin is artificially inflated by sudden and intense demand, and the value of bitcoin is ONLY due to this high demand. Yeah there's some new tech rolled into it but that's largely irrelevant since 99% of people are in it for money. So basically, bitcoin is in a bubble and due to crash hard and we know this because this exact scenario has played out in different markets several times before I don't know what else you want from me. If you want hard data go do a little research on Black Tuesday.

As for you asking me to give you specific price points and time frames, hang on lemme just roll my crystal ball. You're either A. Asking me for things you know I can't come up with, no economist could come up with what you're asking with anything other than their best guess, or B. Totally ignorant of what you're actually asking for. 

Forgive me but *you* actually don't seem to be adding anything here other than vaguely passive aggressive skepticism. Do you not think bitcoin is in a bubble or are you just arguing for arguments sake?
";1;0;False;fucknazimodzzz;drm3b07;Bitcoin today;7le7t9;https://v.redd.it/kvztwkfpqd501
"> Anyone can say bitcoin is a bubble. That's not difficult and it seems like the common sense explanation, at least to me, but you saying that means basically nothing to me. Give actual predictions like an estimated peak it will reach at what time, and back it up with data and logic.

That's not how this works. Because bubbles don't follow financial fundamentals, it's psychology more than anything. An economist of financier can't tell you how long the euphoria is going to last, only that the current valuation is way higher than it should be and that we've seen these kinds of things before. 

Have you seen The Big Short? You know how the main character knew real estate was in a bubble and mortgage backed securities were fucked, but the price kept going up longer than he anticipated? That's how bubbles go. They usually last longer than the detractors think but pop sooner than the believers think. One thing I can say is that when buyers are leveraged, that's an indication that it'll pop sooner rather than later. I don't think people are taking out loans for bitcoin so that should let it last a bit longer at least. 

> Another detail that you can go into is an estimated price it will stabilize at. Obviously cryptocurrencies have some value because of their potential applications once everyone isn't trying to jump on them to make cash, so if you can predict where it will end up with some data, that would also be very useful and interesting to hear.

Normally valuations of assets work by calculating something called ""intrinsic value."" Basically, it's the sum of the discounted future cash flows. Discounted means you account for the time value of money. In other words, $100 today is better than $100 in 5 years, because A) inflation, and B) you can invest that $100 today. 

However, bitcoin obviously has no future cash flows. If you simply hold it, you get no money from it because it doesn't pay dividends or interest. So looking it that way is futile. Others want to look at it like a currency, obviously, since that was its original intention. But it's fucking useless as a currency. Its value is extremely volatile, which is horrible for a currency. Why would I pay someone 1 bitcoin today when I can pay them .5 bitcoin in a week for the same thing? Why would I use bitcoin when the number of places that accept is extremely small? Why would I use bitcoin when transactions take half a day to process and have fees upwards of $20? It's absolutely ludicrous. 

So what's left? Using it as a store of value? Again, way too volatile, and the fact that it has no intrinsic value. Gold, which I also would not invest in, at least has tangible uses as jewelry or in certain technologies. Gold and other precious metals, by the way, has also experienced bubbles. They too are ultimately bound by the value of their uses. Bitcoin has no independent uses. So when it eventually corrects, it'll correct *hard.* If you want to store value, buy a fucking t-bond. They pay a set rate of interest and you are guaranteed to get your principal back at the end.

"> maybe they feel like it's because the tradeoffs are too large

Right. It's not a solution, it's just making different tradeoffs for a short term benefit. I'm not arguing either side, just pointing out that the fundamental limits aren't addressed by this kind of fix. That also makes it much more difficult to get consensus about a fix.

> At least be honest about the situation.

Try not to impose your prejudices on me.

> The original plan of increasing block size is not a work-around. 

It absolutely is. As you pointed out yourself, it's a short term fix and involves tradeoffs.

> You may think it's a bad idea and that's fine, but you're wrong about the fundamentals of Bitcoin.

I'm not saying it's a bad idea, I'm saying it doesn't in any way address the fundamental limits created by a proof of work algorithm running on an unshardable network. It's playing with parameters, trading off properties against each other. 

> My understanding is that Blockstream is making the decisions now. Is that what you mean by governance?

I said no *formal* governance. To the extent that Blockstream has control, it's de facto, and besides there's no accountability to stakeholders which one would typically expect with more formal governance.

That's another fundamental limitation on Bitcoin - the governance model is a bad ancap joke, and the community has been discovering that first hand for a while now.

"Background is in accounting and I understand BTC fairly well. Assuming he does some very illegal things, they can't prove shit honestly EDIT: If he is meticulous and flawless. The burden of proof is on them to prove he has it/had it during the divorce. **DO NOT DO ANYTHING I LISTED HERE AS IT'S VERY VERY ILLEGAL AND COULD RESULT IN TIME IN JAIL** . But in theory here's how people could launder money via BTC (and why the government really sees BTC as a threat in money launders/drug trade). Also, future money laundering techniques will make future Breaking Bad a very very boring show, because there is no need for a carwash or chicken. 


1. Buy some pumped/overvalued altcoin on an exchange tied to your actual personal information.

2. Scrub the alt coin (basically makes it untraceable)

3. Move the scrubbed altcoin to another exchange with fake personal info. Sell the altcoin at a similar BTC cost. Rebuy a more valuable coin (like BTC/ETH/LTC/Monero) with the now untraceable fund and put it in a wallet (meaning, you're out very little - albeit susceptible to a huge crash when you're between cryptos).  We'll call this ""hidden BTC"". 

4. Wait for alt-coin to crash

5. Buy a shitload of crashed altcoin post-crash.

6. Move the same number of the altcoin back to exchange with your personal info.

7. Sell alt-coin at a huge loss and put the low proceeds back into bank. You now have your ""loss"" and your ""hidden BTC"". Tell wife you lost a shitload of money on crypto to ensure she files for divorce. 

8. If asked about it by lawyer, say you were investing in crypto and due to the divorce you divested as you'd be incurring more expenses with a single income. 

On the books, it looks like you bought an altcoin on an exchange, moved it out of your wallet, moved the same number of alt coins back to your wallet, and divested at a huge capital loss. In actuality, you only held the altcoin for a brief period of time and sold it right after. 

The next problem is that you now have a bunch of BTC you need to legitimize.

1. Post-divorce, buy a few mining rigs and set up an LLC. 

2. Use said mining rigs to mine whatever the fuck ICOs you want.

3. Wait until a coin that originated AFTER the divorce moons. It might not be the coin you mined, but that doesn't matter.

4. Calculate a reasonable number of coins you COULD have mined with the mining power you had. 

5. Use your ""hidden BTC"" to buy some alt coins and put it into a wallet. Scrub and transfer to another wallet. Ideally, do it in multiple transactions so you aren't as susceptible to a flash crash. 

6. Deposit alt coin onto an exchange and sell (an exchange outside of the US' jurisdiction would make it a shitload easier). Claim this as LLC profit from your 100% legit mining operation. Pay your fucking taxes. Make sure there's no way to prove you mined XYZ coin instead of PROFIT coin. 


7. Don't be stupid. Live to your prior living standards for years after. If you must flaunt your wealth, wait until you have a justification to do-so (ie a job promotion). Tell all your workers about your LLC. Establish a history before you suddenly become rich.

8. Don't mention what you did to a single fucking soul. Whether it be your drinking buddies, family, or reddit. Everyone has a price. Someone could tip off the wife for a small percentage of her legal ruling. Not only would you risk losing the money, but now you also committed felonious money laundering. 

EDIT: Thought I'd add, I've never tried doing this before because I'm not involved in criminal activity (else I wouldn't have posted on my main account or even on an alt account). If someone has further insight as to why this wouldn't work, feel free to chime in. I'm basing my information solely on my experience with the crypto market + my knowledge of how US money laundering cases. I'm moreso sharing this theory to educate people on the very real reason governments/banks fear crypto. 

EDIT2: Also thought I'd do this for fun

LIST OF CRIMINAL YOU PROBABLY WOULD COMMIT in addition to more: Tax evasion **multiple times**, even if you do pay taxes on the final product (because you didn't claim gains/losses on the exchange of alt-coins). Failure to disclose assets (to both the IRS and to the courts during the divorce). Perjury (at minimum, to the divorce lawyer). Conspiracy. And of course, money laundering. Potential identity theft laws in the foreign country which you use the exchange. Not to mention, the not criminal civil laws.

"ETH is probably the most stable, recognized, and accepted other than BTC (LTC would probably have the same problems as BTC if it was as widely used). I personally don't imagine ETH will go down much if at all and could still grow a good amount, but mostly I like it because it can be used like digital currency should. 

If you're not just looking for a straight up currency replacement and want to invest in something with good technology and growth potential, XRB, XMY, and VTC are all coins I've chosen on a basis of the technology and dev teams supporting them. Yes, disclaimer, I'm holding small amounts of these coins, by all means do your own research too. So far though I've had success with choosing coins based on technology rather than fads and what's currently popular. However, I'm more of a longer term investor and I rarely day trade. If you're to flip coins and day trade often then you'll want to just follow the trends rather than pick coins on their own merits and potential future.

XRB is similar to iota, no mining, no fees, literally instant transactions and this should continue to be instant even under massive load. This is a coin gaining a lot of attention and isn't even on any major exchange yet. I'm expecting some big growth in early 2018. 

XMY is a blockchain using five separate hashing algorithms for increased blockchain security, decentralisation, and should be something that can be mined by anyone. They've also successfully used some kind of mining-voting consensus to fork one of the five algorithms to a new one without any issues so it should be able to do so again in the future if necessary. Currently 4 of the algorithms are mined by asics and one by CPU (yescrpyt). They used to have a GPU algorithm or two and will probably vote out the least essential asic algo and have another one good for GPU mining again in the future. Their mantra is essentially to have everyone able to mine forever. This multi chain also keeps transactions fast and fees low. It's been around since 2014 with solid support and has finally started to be noticed and gone up in value considerably in the past week. 

VTC is basically just anti asic. They've forked in the past when an asic was going to be able to mine an they'd do it again if necessary. This will most likely always be a GPU coin. I'm not sure if technology wise what being anti asic does other than decentralisation, but if the above two coins have better technology behind them, the devs working on this coin are fantastic and the market has been receptive to and treated VTC well. It's been stagnant lately, but had gone from about $0.70 to $9 a month or two ago. It's one of those coins that might end up being one of the few to go up and break the $100 mark. I believe it will be getting coinbase or other direct USD markets soon and will also be getting lighting network swaps with LTC. In my opinion if it gets coinbase and USD markets as well as lighting swaps, it'll instantly become a better LTC. 

Again, I am invested in these three coins, so understand that while I'm explaining why I believe in these coins and why I'm invested in them, of course I have all the incentives in the world to tell other people to invest in these coins too so if you're interested, I'd recommend looking at the coins on market cap and the checking out their respective sub-Reddits first.";6;0;False;Tyr808;drlvo1n;Bitcoin today;7le7t9;https://v.redd.it/kvztwkfpqd501

"It's not a dumb question. I'm somewhat of an outsider myself. There's no good answer to that question right now. It really depends. So, BCH and BTC are based on the same technology. I don't mean blockchain in general. I mean that BCH is a copy of BTC. When someone copies the codebase of a cryptocurrency (or any software which is open source) and makes modifications and changes the name, it's called a fork. What really determines what makes one cryptocurrency better than another is up to the individual user and their conception of it. BTC, BCH and every other cryptocurrency have different features. Some of them are more anonymous (Monero). Some of them use different core technology (IOTA). The BCH supporters contend that their cryptocurrency has faster transactions and lower fees and that that is what makes it better. They justify their claim to betterness by referencing Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper that originally describes Bitcoin and started this entire field (so far as I understand the history here). BTC supporters contend, I believe, that BTC has had to move away from the whitepapers for reasons dealing with the technical requirements changing as the project was implemented and the purpose changing as it has been deployed into the real world. BCH supporters are thinking digital currency, the sort you can use if you go to the gas station or to get a slice of pizza, and thus BTC is not suitable for that when the transaction fees are high (higher than the cost of the item you'd be purchasing) and the confirmation times are way too long (due to backlog in the mempool). BTC supporters are interested in implementing solutions to those problems (segwit, lightning network) but also seem to have recognize that the purpose of BTC may have changed from digital cash you use to buy illegal things on silk road to another form of value storage (like gold). There is also an argument for each side about what features of a cryptocurrency end up driving centralization, which can lead to market manipulation for the benefit of the very few. 

My perspective as an outsider is that this shouldn't be a tug of war. I understand why it is. People have a financial interest in draining value to and from different coins and taking market share in the public eye. My perspective is that each serves a different purpose and should be used in tandem, the exact same way things work in our financial atmosphere offline. It isn't cash or gold. You can have both and you **should** have both (liquidity and a slow growth asset). 

Through that lens, it makes all of the complaining I typically see on r/btc seem really, really absurd. I don't care about a whitepaper that was written before this tech was implemented. I care about seeing a fully functional ecosystem of digital financial vehicles emerge and take root and supplant our current fiat currencies.

Exchanges don't use the bitcoin network they have their own centralised ledger. The btc network is only used transferring btc to or from the exchange. ;37;2;False;Jaan321;drlwzuf;Bitcoin today;7le7t9;https://v.redd.it/kvztwkfpqd501
"> Is there a way to tell if those 284k TX were people trading the currency on an exchange? 

(Edit:) Most exchanges are centralized, i.e. trades happen off the blockchain. So actual trades don't account for those transactions.

However, a lot of the transactions are likely to be people depositing and withdrawing money from exchanges because of the boom in trading activity. There's no evidence of Bitcoin adoption as a currency increasing dramatically recently - if anything, it's been falling off due to some of the problems.

> If/when these TX go through, would they have any effect on the current price on exchanges if so? 

Because most exchange trades happen off the blockchain, the only effect that Bitcoin transaction speed has on the BTC price is indirect.

If people are having trouble getting their money on and off exchanges, that's going to have an effect on prices. Interestingly, when the Bitfinex exchange recently was having trouble with deposits and withdrawals, its Bitcoin price ended up getting over $1000 higher than some other exchanges, but came back down again once the problems were (somewhat) mitigated.

> Are these funds locked up until the transactions go through? 

In theory, it's possible to ""cancel"" unconfirmed transactions, by reissuing the transaction with a higher fee (to make it more likely to be picked up by miners) and sending the money back to yourself. In practice, there can be challenges with this. Wallet software often doesn't support it, you may not control the transaction (if your money is on an exchange), etc.

> Could someone have bought BTC at a lower price, but due to a delayed TX it goes through at the higher price?

(Edit:) The trade itself is unaffected because (most) exchanges are centralized and not on the blockchain. There's no notion of ""price"" on the blockchain - 1 BTC is always worth 1 BTC.

"I think it's pretty easy to argue that scarcity is already a property of Bitcoin. There's an upper limit of 21 million Bitcoins, and some 4 million Bitcoins are estimated to be lost by early adopters (when Bitcoin was worth pennies). People like to mention there are 33 million millionaires and only 21 million Bitcoins, but really there are only likely to ever be ~16 million active Bitcoins.

I see what you're saying though, if there were a huge sell off it would put a lot more coins into circulation which makes it less scarce. I think the big argument against this is, as more institutional money gets involved in cryptocurrencies, you're likely to see it swoop in to buy the dips and sit on that extra supply.

Bitcoin has a long history of crashing. That's why the traditional price meme is a [Bitcoin in a roller coaster](https://www.google.com/search?q=bitcoin+rollercoaster&tbm=isch).

This is why the development team sees block size increases as the last resort and opted to change how the transactions work (SegWit) and started to build second layer systems on top of the network (LN).

Some people said ""fuck that"", and the Bitcoin Cash fork happened, with BCH simply doing the bigger blocks as an immediate fix, to make it a viable digital currency *today*.

IMHO trusting the exchange defeats the whole purpose of bitcoin, as it centralizes and removes the use of the blockchain.  Bitcoin the algorithm is determined by popularity.

The problem Bitcoin runs into is that you are dealing with something that now has a rather large financial value. And when it comes to money, people become very conservative and protective, and thus change is very slow and hard to implement. In addition, a majority of clients on the network need to support the change simultaneously or else you end up with a huge mess of conflicts. And with a giant mess of conflicts, the entire network's capability of processing transactions could grind to a halt. Bitcoin's solution to this is consensus, which often requires a supermajority of clients to be capable of supporting a version.

I wouldn't be entirely shocked to see it drop back to $1000.   The entire rise was driven by speculative investors without a sniff of a clue for what BTC was, now that they are leaving en masse it will trickle back to a realistic price range.   ~$500-1000;2;1;False;jloy88;drmgpkj;Bitcoin today;7le7t9;https://v.redd.it/kvztwkfpqd501

"So, I am a swing trader with a few years of experience under my belt. I by no means do it as a fulltime job, and I by no means like crypto, but should you have any holdings in cryptocurrencies, the following information is extremely important.

The past few weeks showed the setup of a possible head and shoulders pattern. It seems crypto is in the right trough. What happens next really depends on how it behaves over the next couple days.

An educated guess is its running through a head and shoulders pattern since we already have established the following set points.

- left shoulder around December 7th 16,500 realm

- left dip, 13500 realm around December 10th

- head, 19500 realm around December 17th.

And it looks like we are establishing a neckline at around 12,000 right now. Which suggests a falling neckline. This is Bad. If you say this is good you are an idiot. If it is a head and shoulders pattern this is in, it will rebound to the 16000 realm to complete the right shoulder before it falls off a cliff to god knows where.

This bubble looks all set to pop, possibly in the next week or so. If I had any holdings, I would be watching the price very closely for signs that confirm this pattern.

Recommended course of action if you hold crypto for some stupidly retarded reason: watch it over the next day or so, see if it sinks past 12000. If it does, *sell immediately to protect capital*. If it starts to rebound, target your sell point at around 15,000 to 16,000 as that should be where the right shoulder will peak. If you miss that you are fucked because bitcoin will fall off a cliff and the entire crypto market will crash. Optimistic guess that lower bounds of crash would be to low thousands high hundreds, since wall street is starting to poke around with it. But it could crash to 0 and die in a fire.

So, all of that is Assuming of course you could pull you money out quick enough, like any other security that exists ever. But crypto, being a retarded combination of volatile and not very liquid at all, probably won't let you get out with any sense of urgency, which could mean you miss the boat and lose biggly. So, with that fundamental taken into account.

 **Sell, sell it all and run for your life. Don't look back, leave. Get the fuck out. She's going down captain! You will not go to space today.**
-

Hopefully that's memey enough for the densest of crypto heads to understand. 

If your lucky enough to pull out in time, and still wish to invest, I encourage you to look into investing into green industries, robotics, and municipal bonds. The skills you all are learning still translate to other securities, and you stand to make money, as long as you don't make the same mistake of getting cocky and putting all of your eggs into a rocket powered basket without thinking about buying a parachute. And last bits of parting advice: when trading, the worst thing you can think is that 'this time its different' it never is. Don't let emotion make the decisions for you, base your decisions on the fundamentals and the technicals and not *hype trains*

Good luck, and I hope you get out in time.

new poster...I have been following this BTC run from the sidelines...I have been a hedge fund analyst trading stocks and options (more volatile than the craziest day in bitcoin) for 9 years (started in Jan 08 before the crash) so only thinking about it from that framework..I am curious why folks do not talk about bitcoin in terms of market cap. I am also curious how many folks have participated in parabolic trades. It seems pretty obvious to me that a 14k move that has trumped years of marketcap growth in less than 2 mos needs to be consolidated. I would think 8K seems like a screaming buy but also totally reasonable expectation over the next few months but plan to leg in at hopefully 13k and more heavily at 11k but the goal would be to load up at 8k. Almost all stock breakouts occur after periods of sustained consolidation so 20k 17k 14k and the daily freakouts all feels like noise until you go through this consolidation phase and you do not see sustained rallies during periods of high volatility so that also needs to dissipate which takes time. The flip side is i saw parabolic charts that look exactly like this in crude/agriculture in 08, DDD (3d printing company in 2012), GPRO 90 dollar stock went parabolic now trades at 9...my point is my strategy is to try and average cost around 10k put my stop at 5k eat a 50% loss if wrong and if it breaks below that know that its a bubble and the retail buyer we all need to get to 50k 100k will be burned and never coming back. Seems like not a lot of financial perspective being applied on this thread so curious if I am just not thinking about this the right way with this buyer base. I respect the HODL philosophy but i am not sure how many people are understanding the overall market cap dollar gains that have occured over the % moves. ;10;4;False;villen2001;drlx5s3;Bitcoin today;7le7t9;https://v.redd.it/kvztwkfpqd501

As you can see from some lines I am drawing here connecting pieces of it, that the trendline is perpendicular to the failing resistance of the square root of your mom so my recommendation is to do a thing and then eat a donut""

But I actually do take some comfort in the idea that price was increasing along a certain parabola all year, and then in December it spiked ""hypodermically"" above that parabola, and so people have not wanted to buy as normal because they figure, well, the price is probably going to come back down. And that the drop back down to the former parabola will be painful but then after that we'll get another 10x or more increase over the course of 2018.

I hope that's a joke.  If not, I would suggest you pull out of bitcoin and focus on stabilizing rather than fantasizing about how you can double down on your money.  That's the same mentality people have when they are behind on a payment and go to the casino to make up for it.

Investing in something this volatile is fun if you have extra cash to burn or simply as a more interesting way of gambling, but if you are going to struggle financially if this doesn't work out, I would personally get out of it now, even if that means getting out at a loss.

If at some point you stabilize to the point where you're not worried about rent, I would still suggest you save some money up as an emergency fund.  And if you want to keep investing at that point, buying safe stocks is a much better bet.

Missing out on an opportunity to get much more out of your money sucks, but struggling to make it from pay check to pay check fucks up your life.

Anyway, I'm not trying to lecture you.  I'm just saying my point of view and what I would do so you can at least think it through from another perspective.  I hope things work out for you.";23;1;False;Ref0rmed;drm1jgb;Bitcoin today;7le7t9;https://v.redd.it/kvztwkfpqd501

"Be greedy when others are cautions, be cautious  when others are greedy. If you are new to investing in Bitcoin only invest what you are willing to lose as you have an incredible amount to gain. It's not terrible advice for those who have been in this game or know how to safely invest. For example Last month starting on Nov 8, Bitcoin dropped about 25% from $7800 to $5800. Look where we are now. No one who is a longtime HODLer or believer in Bitcoin is shook that this dip is happening. It will stable out and the price will rise again. We buy on these dips and everyone who did  last Nov is still way up. I initially bought in at $300 a BTC way back in 2013. You think this dip worries me I've seen so many of these on the way to where we are now.  I bought as much as I could at 14200 because I believe that is close to the floor of this dip. What shoots up has to correct in order to keep going up, and Bitcoins rise this year has been meteoric ( under 1k at Jan 2017 - 20k Dec 2017) so it's not a bad thing it corrects and builds pressure for the next rise.

That degree of loss is me saying let me really be wrong and not care if i eat it on a generational trade.

 Simultaneously Reddit Crypto boards got flooded by BCH shills bashing BTC and worshiping BCH. And the following day, in a suspiciously convenient time for all the shills Coinbase adds BCH, causing BTC to rapidly plummet and BCH to rapidly rise in a short period of time.
 The cartel probably intended to pump BCH at the expense of BTC, and it worked for them in the short term, but the side effect is that it caused a lot of people to pull out of crypto completely, causing damage to all the Cryptos.

"I think you’re thinking about this in the right way but there’s a fundamental issue that arises: is Bitcoin a currency or just a payment system?  It can’t be a currency since that requires a nation or group of nations to control.  (Yet many hype it as such).  

If it is a payment system then it should trade as a fraction of existing payment systems in part because of the value of networks (like AOL in terms of subscribers or visa/MasterCard in terms of transactions.   

When you frame it as a payment system you have to accept the warts (currently high fees and slow transactions).   

I know you said you are a trader and I’m talking about it as in fundamentals. So slight disconnect there.  But I think what I’m saying is the foundation of why this is a global phenomenon.  It will make less sense to us in the USA than to those either under strict regimes or under toy governments whose fiscal policy is essentially self enriching.  

I researched the shit out of bitcoin before I invested in August. I have a background in payment tech. I wish I had learned about it sooner because it really is amazing technically even with the warts.  I threw $30K at it. Bought some of that in a dip that took a few weeks to sort out.  Up about 3X.  

I will likely buy more on Monday.   As a trader You should know that stocks that have performed the best historically also have had the highest volatility.

if someone is willing to give you food for it, then it has value. it's all a psychological concept

just because something is intangible doesn't mean it's not allowed to have value, people buy and sell digital things all the time now. like weapons and armor in games 

if you're asking ""why does it need to exist when we have other things that are a measure of value that do the job better?"" then that's a different answer. the answer to that is, bitcoin was designed to do be better than fiat at two things, being anonymous and being out of the control of a governing power. the third thing, being easy to exchange was on the list of things it should do well but has since fallen off due to unforseen design flaws

other cryptocurrencies built on the back of bitcoin's innovation handle transactions much better

It's not like stocks because those give dividends, which drives how much each stock should be worth. It's not like gold, because gold has a use outside of a store of value and 1000's of years of being established.   
  
Personally I don't see how Bitcoin has a future, but because of my lack of vision I have never made any money off of it, so I really know nothing. It's too risky for me personally, and I've been watching it for a few years.

"Coming from /r/all and have not personally invested in Bitcoin but there is one key issue with how to laid this out and that is the missing the point the in the most of the developed world, computing power is a very real resource that drives many of the luxuries we do.

While (at least as far as I know) the algorithms it does are mostly pointless it is more of building up an environment that one day they can be not useless. What if (trying to do ELI5 example) they helped handle the server load YouTube uses for organizing videos. That is something that they already legitimately pay money for by having to build and power servers to do.

The idea at it's ""core"" makes sense in that computing power and algorithm solving is a ""valuable"" resource in modern world and how the system is scaled and designed ensures the basic functioning of a currency. Just the adoption of this by any wide spread metric is still FAR OFF, and personally likely not even for decades.

Edit: Also on how fast it has grown. While it is a massive jump and there are a LOT of caveats to those stories that ""pluff"" these stories it is key to also look at it from if you invest in a company or tech RIGHT before they took off. If you invested a bit of money into smart phone devices, software tools, etc in 2004/2005 you would be insanely rich today. Take Apple for example which had stock prices at $2 a share in early 2004 that is now worth $175 a share today and Apple was still ""big"" in 2004. Now imagine people more in the know and ground floor who can invest even earlier to get major payoffs. I wouldn't read into those stories no more than friends of major CEO's who got rich by knowing them and pulling small favors when they where small.";2;0;False;;drm3ywv;Bitcoin today;7le7t9;https://v.redd.it/kvztwkfpqd501
Most of the things you said was correct. But it's not a Ponzi scheme since someone has to get out for others to come in. In a Ponzi scheme people can buy in without anyone leaving, and when there are no more buyers it will inevitably collapse. In a market, a seller can become a buyer again so a collapse is not inevitable.

"The value of bitcoin is that it allows people to buy and sell things. Just like the dollar allows people to buy and sell things, so purchasers and retailers want them, which raises their value. If retailers stopped accepting the currency, its value would fall to zero.

The reason bitcoin went up so much is because it was seen as a reliable currency for doing anonymous transactions. This combined with a limited number of bitcoins in existence. 

Unstable currencies are not good for retailers so I feel gradually more people will start using more stable alternative cryptocurrencies and bitcoin will fall to zero. Its not a ponzi scheme, its a bubble. ";-1;1;False;k543;drm1vfz;Bitcoin today;7le7t9;https://v.redd.it/kvztwkfpqd501

With the right transaction fee it should go through fast but you entered a way to low transaction fees, miners won't pick it up fast. This could take forever.

There are several solutions. Either wait it out, rebroadcat it, replace by fee (RBF protocol), double-spend with higher fee or Child pays for parent (CPFP)

I hardly know anything about XRB, but from my understanding it has pretty good protocols (its similar to IOTA), but has little attention. Bitcoin Cash also has pretty good practices. I believe if any coin overtakes BTC, its going to be Bitcoin Cash. LiteCoin and Bitcoin Cash are pretty much the same thing, except Bitcoin Cash has greater advertising efforts and shares the name Bitcoin. The majority of the public equates cryptocurrencies with Bitcoin. If Bitcoin Cash wins the spotlight most people wont notice, if LiteCoin starts to take the spotlight a lot of people will be confused and probably resist it, same with any other coin. My bet is that BTC will either adopt the practices of better coins, or it will fall to BCH.;3;0;False;thudrs;drmsnsm;To the new guys, let's see how tough you really are;7lhj3w;https://i.imgur.com/vHYx0Me.gif

"If we wanted money and we know its volatile why haven't we all cashed out while we have lots of money? I've been in for 5 years and I'm not even considering selling for another 4 - post halving. I'm a software engineer. I see a technology not a price. A lot of us are tech enthusiasts its what brought us here. One of dozens of 35% plus dips doesn't impact the reasons we are invested at all, nor does 1000's of percent increase. I'll leave when I dislike the projects technical direction or don't see its possibilities to improve the future. It's the same reason the Bcash supporters left. They disliked the technical direction, they didn't care too much that it was fucking them in price. If they did they would have come back. Price is not a significant factor for us long term holders deciding to keep our coins. If it was we would have sold long ago. There is no rational person who is considering price in deciding to hold or not that doesn't sell at 1000's of percent gain. It's why everyone on the outside looking in thinks it's a cult, they only see the irrationality of the decisions being made around price. They have no understanding of the technology or what kind of future bitcoin holders see as being uniquely possible for the first time.

Might take a year, might take 20, but right now BTC is the giant because it was first.

"I'm not invested in Bitcoin. Mainly because it's not scalable aka the more people use it, the bigger the fees get etc. They say Lightning Network will help, but from my own research, I don't think so.

Bitcoin (at the start when it didn't yet face scalability issues)is a good vision on how a currency should be: decentralised, fast, low fees, max supply cap, borderless, you control your money. Try accessing $100k from anywhere in the world within minutes. Only problem for Bitcoin is again the fact that it doesn't scale well. Nakamoto hoped that in the future someone is going to solve the scalability problem.

I personally believe that DASH, XRP, IOTA and XRB(or atleast one of them) will become the main crypto currencies actually used as currencies.

Their will be a crypto currency in the future that will be used as a currency whether you like it or not.

"> Well, really nothing has intrinsic value.

In a certain sense, that's true, but that's not the point here. The important consequence of ""gold has intrinsic value"" is that there are factors that drive demand for gold other than its use as a ""store of value."" 

If the *only* purpose of some asset is as a store of value, then you're entirely reliant on everyone agreeing that it's a store of value - i.e. people value it only because people agree to value it. Without some external source of demand, that's extremely fragile and is virtually the definition of a bubble. All it takes is one good scare and such a bubble will pop for good.

> Right now its mainnet blockchain is the most secure ledger in the planet, its data (transaction history) is more protected and transparent than anything else you can imagine. 

...except for all the other cryptocurrencies with similar or better properties. And that's the killer threat to Bitcoin as a pure store of value. It cannot survive long term if that's its only purpose, because other cryptocurrencies will eventually take over as mediums of exchange and units of account, and those currencies will then make more sense as a store of value.

"You are correct. But sadly in the grand scale of things to come, I fear fiat more than crypto. The purchasing power of that dollar can be just as volatile (granted at a much slower rate of change).

Fast-forward to the year 2020, and we’re going to pay $10 for just the fries and drink. In a relatively small section of time the dollar has lost several hundred percentage points in its purchasing power. For a short while we saw the pay scale rise to match the cost of living... But lets be honest, our current wage earnings are not keeping up pace at all. And that doesn’t even account for the strength of an isolated savings account shriveling up! The cost of living is driving people into poverty, and what’s more important is the fact this pattern is cyclical. Periods of economic growth followed by steep falls into recessions and depressions.

Well, really nothing has intrinsic value.

If gold looses only its scarcity one day, it will loose it value.

Right now its mainnet blockchain is the most secure ledger in the planet, its data (transaction history) is more protected and transparent than anything else you can imagine.

"Oh yeah 100% I don't know how it functions. I'm no genius but I tried reading into Bitcoin and it still makes no sense. I cant code but I've got an intermediate knowledge of computers. Idk dude I'm just going by if it sounds like BS, looks like BS, and is perpetuated by people who have something to gain like BS, it just might be BS. Like technically if you got everyone you knew to buy the fairly limited supply Bitcoin the price would have to go up. And in a sense you would make money. But there would be no creation of actual value so that's why I think, IMO, it crashes a lot. It's just the flow of more people buying and then dudes selling, no actual value progression.

&nbsp;

So yeah last post but In my defense I feel like I have some understanding of the economics behind Bitcoin yet I'm trying to help and asking people to sell after pointing out the faults. Just a heads up, unfortunate reality, but some other people definitely understand the faults I'm pointing out but are asking you to buy anyway... So yeah watch out for those guys please

"> There could be 100 million times more dollars in the economy and all that would change is the relative price of things when using that currency.

But that's exactly the problem. If I have $1000 in a bank account, and someone adds 100 million times more dollars into the economy, the price of everything in dollars would go up dramatically, and the money in my bank account would become effectively worthless. That's called inflation.

If the money supply is not restricted, inflation will cause the value of a currency to tend towards zero. Even in the real world cases of hyperinflation, the money supply is still restricted, it's just not restricted enough. If it's not restricted at all, a currency cannot work.

So a limited supply is actually critical to the functioning of a currency.

The rest of your comment has nothing to do with what I'm talking about. I was just pointing out that it's incorrect to say, as you did in your first comment, that limited supply is not a condition of value. It's absolutely critical to it.

Yes this change happens over years, but it’s undeniably accelerating and with no seeable strategy for reprieve.

"For a currency, rarity is in fact important. The reason is that once people are using it, it has value agreed on by the market. If you can print more money effortlessly, you create value without providing corresponding value in exchange, and the value of everyone else's money drops. If anyone can do that, the value of the currency is completely undermined and it becomes useless as a currency.

Slicing the currency up into smaller pieces doesn't have this effect, since that doesn't change the value of the currency. 

Note that I'm not saying that ""limited supply"" is a sufficient justification for value on its own. It's a necessary, but not sufficient, criterion.

As an aside, in its current form, a Bitcoin can be sliced into 100 million pieces (satoshis) maximum, so the entire Bitcoin capitalization can't exceed 2100 trillion satoshis.

Once solves, they recieve a reward of 12.5 as of now but it halves every few years IIRC ( so limited supply of 21mil). In order to verify a transaction, you have to get a series of confirmations from a series of miners which essentially ensures that you are sending a legit bitcoin(block contains hash of previous block , hence a chain) so many excahnges/wallets won't accept btc without at least 2 confirmations which will take some time (not instantaneous).  As for the system being overloaded, I agree. There is a set limit of tx's per block of 1mb (~1000 tx's) so you need to insentivise miners to include your tx in their block, so naturally as more and more people send BTc you will have to pay more and more fees. 

So right now, btc is centralized which goes against the very fabric of what it was designed to be like and unscalable with power centralized in places where electricity is cheap, like china and indonesia.

As to venmo, I don't have it so and I don't know how it works, but as I understand it, you just pay money from a credit card into a balance and pay others using that balance. Essentially the same thing as putting money into paypal for instance.

"> But I’m willing to bet we will have absolutely no idea about what’s quantum secure until it hits the world. 

[Post-quantum cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-quantum_cryptography) is an [active](https://www.pqcrypto.org/) field. This work builds on what we know about [quantum algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_algorithm) and [quantum complexity theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_complexity_theory).

IOTA [claims](https://learn.iota.org/faq/what-makes-iota-quantum-secure) they're quantum secure because:
> IOTA uses hash-based signatures (https://www.imperialviolet.org/2013/07/18/hashsig.html) instead of elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). Not only is hash-based signatures a lot faster than ECC, but it also greatly simplifies the overall protocol (signing and verification). What actually makes IOTA quantum-secure is the fact that we use Winternitz signatures. IOTA's ternary hash function is called Curl.

I believe the ""Winternitz signatures"" this refers to are originally described as ""Winternitz one time signatures"" in [this paper from Merkle](http://www.merkle.com/papers/Certified1979.pdf).";2;0;False;zjs;drmnqmd;To the new guys, let's see how tough you really are;7lhj3w;https://i.imgur.com/vHYx0Me.gif

I came for a possible retirement home, perhaps my child's college fund, maybe nothing. It was $250 ( a mere fraction of your investment) ... I almost threw it into my Vanguard. It was gift money.

"Can you explain why? I went through a lot of effort to sell most of my cryptocurrency over the last month when it became obvious that it was in a bubble. The absurdly high fees required to transfer bitcoin to an exchange clearly show it's no longer remotely viable as a currency. I can't imagine why anyone would want to throw more money in to it. The 25X gains in one year was certainly nice for me, but it's just baffling why anyone would want to buy at the top into a currency that no longer has any functionality as a currency. 

I would also never put $15k in something as volatile as crytptocurrency unless my total portfolio was at least $1.5 million. You should allocate no more than a couple percent of your portfolio to ""play money"" and the rest to real investments.";12;2;False;Jaqqarhan;drmsdw9;To the new guys, let's see how tough you really are;7lhj3w;https://i.imgur.com/vHYx0Me.gif

Then I stopped paying attention for a long while.

And here we are.

I fully understand that, one day, Bitcoin will reach peak penetration, and that it will largely level off in value.  My first reason for buying in was never to make money, though.  My first reason for buying in was to have a hedge against inflation that still allows me to make online purchases (gold doesn't do this).  Making some return on it is just a happy bonus.

I also never put in more than I can afford to lose.  And I have picked out some price milestones where I will probably sell.";2;0;False;dafunkmonster;drmpy6s;To the new guys, let's see how tough you really are;7lhj3w;https://i.imgur.com/vHYx0Me.gif

Did I get burned at Mt Gox, Bit trader and a few other places? Sure did.

"I went through all that back in May... pissed me off then also... but I got in before the insane rush... now is like ""just when I feel like I've seen it all...""

The lesson is ""Buy the dips, when they're actually dips..."" the 20% down after a 1000% gain in a week, that's not a dip... 50+% down, that's a dip... but... if you don't have money on both sides of the volatility, then you're gonna have a bad time. 

""Stops"" are either your best friend, or your worst enemy... you need to have money to buy in lower, yet the long holdings to keep set ""insanely high"" sells... because that's why you're here, right... 

So selling right when the rocket is 1000' off the platform will leave you saying... ""Well, that was stupid.""

These ppl are the same ppl saying it's worthless as if the dollar isn't just as make pretend/manipulated/devalued and in danger of losing it supremacy. It can be a currency, commodity, wealth store, technology, a trust value, a tool for accountability. We can design and fork it to the rules we want for the society we are, a mistrustful bunch of greedy douches. that's revolutionary... it is possible to be all these. It's duality and eventual application in the future can revolutionize our economic/political systems and institutions of power whether or not the populace understands it. If we let it.

Pick a stock in the doghouse that you believe will turn around in 5 years.  Do some research and if you find something undervalued with a dividend, your strategy will pay off.  There's a reason Buffet states that compounding interest is the only way to make money.  Safely, securely and not gambling.

If you're after the gamble, then go for it but I wouldn't employ a buy and hold strategy for that.  Buy the dips sell the peaks and keep a close eye on and don't get greedy.  ";1;1;False;Archisoft;drmppk8;To the new guys, let's see how tough you really are;7lhj3w;https://i.imgur.com/vHYx0Me.gif

"Just to put a different perspective on this for people.  The whole year there has been a slow burning mania that slowly build.  We are not at the phase where people are literally taking out loans against their housed to buy bitcoin.  We are at a peak level of buying pressure.

This was teh top for a long time.  Yes we will probably bounce from here to 16-18k and make peope hopeful again.  And that will be your chance to get out before a bear market that turns into consolidation between 5 and 10k.  

The technology has been outpaced by the mania and things will need to even out.  Im sure in a year or 2 we will be back above 20k.  But if your one of those peope that took out loans or used money you cant lose you will have one last chance to get out before a long term downtrend followed by consolidation.

The new guys actually have an incentive to continue holding. They got into the crypto game to make money, not lose it. They're going to continue holding until they make their money back or profit.

The holders from 2016 and earlier could cash out now if they cant handle the pressure. They're already making a lot of money, just less than they would've made a week ago.

I've never had to work harder to throw money at something before between the exchanges not accepting new people to verification, 6-10 day long bank transfers, weekly coinbase caps, etc.

Point is there's a huge future for all of this stuff, IMO. It's fun to stare at the ticker and ride the emotional roller coaster of your portfolio fluctuating more on a daily basis than a U.S stock portfolio does in a year, but this isn't a 24/7 upward trend.

Here's the way I look at it: Bitcoin is either everything so many  brilliant young minds think it is, or its vapor.  Thus, the value of one bitcoin is either well above $100k, or zero.
