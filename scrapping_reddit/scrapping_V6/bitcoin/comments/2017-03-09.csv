"1) False. There's a reason no one has brought up charges in any state.

2/3) The point is, if the actions weren't the story but rather proof of those actions was the story, very little actually changed. 

Speculation and circumstances vs proof doesn't mean much outside of court, and this wasn't a legal matter. 

When the answer to the question ""what did the leaks reveal?"" Is ""proof of what could already be comfortably assumed"", the *content* of the leaks ultimately didn't do anything. 

That's not too say the leaks didn't change public perception. It wasn't the content of the leaks that did that. Most people are oblivious to how inconsequential the overwhelming majority of the emails were.

">Considering they were bound by law to stay impartial this makes it even more important and valuable.

They are since they ask for donations and their charter clearly states they are supposed to be impartial.

>You're telling me you don't believe that the RNC doesn't do the same thing with Fox and others?

You're making a straw man, I didn't say that. Besides, the RNC and the DNC can be both wrong at the same time...

>The DNC hack was nothing more than photographs of someone's dirty laundry. You know it's there without the photographs and having the photographs really doesn't change anything except forcing you to think about it.

"> That's your own answer to your own question, good for you if you knew the truth in advance, but you don't represent everyone else. Others like me were skeptical, like I said, what was once considered crazy conspiracy theories was proven to be true and is also cited in the DNC lawsuit as evidence.

Did I know it before the Primary? No. But after seeing Nevada, Utah, and others, the leak ended up being more ""no shit"" than ""no way"". I volunteered for Bernie and didn't vote for Hillary (not that it would've mattered in Texas). The leaks may have finished the puzzle, but the picture was visible well before them.  

They really weren't crazy conspiracy theories. Exit polling being off by a greater percentage than our State Department says indicates election fraud. Debates being scheduled when they would have the lowest viewership. Locking out Bernie for reporting that there was an error in the database... Occam's Razor had long since settled on the DNC pushing Hillary.

Most people don't even read the articles. The headlines *were* the story that people remembered. That was the narrative. The headlines weren't typically ""DNC puts thumb on scale for Hillary""; if you only read the headlines, your perceptions of the leaks had no basis for magnitude beyond the longevity of the story. Since WikiLeaks was steadily leaking the emails, the story's longevity seemed infinite at points. The private email server became conflated with the DNC leak and the media narrative people remember was something entirely different from the truth. 

Looping back to the start of this conversation,
It takes exceptional naivete to place such an immense difference between 100% and 90% certainty when you're in a zero-sum game, especially when you know that the 90% certainty will stay at that point because the person able to provide that certainty has said he wasn't going to. Assange admitting to having RNC emails but that ""they weren't interesting enough"" to release is clearly him showing a bias. All you have is Assange's word that they're not interesting while he was actively leaking against the DNC and had been telling GOP voices like Roger Stone to prepare for such leaks. Don't assume Assange had altruistic intentions. ";1;1;False;WildRookie;deoyahy;BREAKING: CIA turned every Microsoft Windows PC in the world into spyware.

"What do you see happening that would send the US into ""enviable DISSIDENT""? 

Trump won because of Gerrymandering which has happened for years. They lobbied the laws to be this way and people can't do anything? They can't touch the elite so what ""enviable DISSIDENT"" will the people do? Riot? That just hurts themselves and other middle class/ lower class people. We can't touch their money. We can't touch their businesses without hurting ourselves. They will keep the police and military feed and happy to keep the masses in place. I see no way that middle class people will do anything because there is so little they can do. 

Boycott? They can't boycott the Mega Corporations (Nestle https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nestl%C3%A9) because they need food, and need houses, and the utilities( utilities which are ok). 

You don't ""need"" a cell phone, people just want them, the government makes it law that you can get a cheap reliable land line that is it. You don't ""need"" internet, and the government is so slow that if you lost it due to not having enough money they won't bring prices down. 

Medical is all a scam unless you are dying. Then they will save you and stick you will a huge bill. 

College is a ""choice"" not a right. So if you get in massive debt, or can't go because you can't afford it, the government says ""tough luck"" because this is how Education is ran. If you have kids and you are mad about the education, then earn more money because the government elected that crazy woman, because Trump won. So you can't change it. Only thing you can do is hope you make enough to take your kids to a private school if private schools are still around with that crazy woman. 

You want renewable resources instead of natural gas, coal and oil? Tough luck you don't choose that. We can just hope whatever Obama did before the end of his term takes effect. But honestly Big Oil Lobbied it to be this way. And it looks like Russia needs Big Oil to stay in power. 

I could go on and on about the problems we all face, but face it, Big Evil Corporations are in control. If you Riot you just hurt yourself, and other Middle Class/ Lower Class people. You will never touch the Billionaires or their money. They will just run away to a different country on their private helicopters and private jets until we kill ourselves or stop.

Keep this for the philosophy professor who gets too much high too often. Otherwise, credibility matters for those are seeking the truth.

>Speculation and circumstances vs proof doesn't mean much outside of court, and this wasn't a legal matter.

It is a legal matter, and it matters to journalists and informed citizens alike. It makes the difference between the news article being published or not and a small but not negligible portion of undecided voters not voting for Hillary.

That's just false. The DNC and RNC are private organizations as are their primaries. They have no laws they have to abide by during them.
