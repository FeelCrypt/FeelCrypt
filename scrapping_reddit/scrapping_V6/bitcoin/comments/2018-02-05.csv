"Doesn't matter what you took, I'm just speaking to the level of economic understanding displayed here. I'm not the first to point out the deflation problem of Bitcoin, and most Bitcoiners have moved on to arguing that it's a ""store of value"" now that the ""deflation is good, mkay"" viewpoint has largely been put to bed.

You're assuming something that won't happen, given the nature of the beast - it won't stabilize when the majority are speculators and there's no other reason to buy into it. What would create stability in the market? 

I'll assume (just for fun) deflation becomes stable at 2%. What happens then is people take advantage of the risk-less arbitrage opportunity of a 4-5% net return by buying and holding Bitcoin. There's fundamentally no winning a currency battle when holding offers you more benefits than trading. 

I'm not sure what philosophical angle you expect me to buy into, but saying it has anything to do with ""humans main purpose"" isn't an economic argument. Not everyone has to be expected to ""hoard"", but if an arbitrage opportunity exists you can damn well bet people will take advantage of it.";1;0;False;Azara1th;dtqx58f;The last 3 months in 47 seconds.;7v438b;https://v.redd.it/typ8fdslz3e01

"> i bought bitcoinn when it got to $10,000 .

I'm so sorry, makes the 25 coins I lost at gox seem not so bad. I think I only have a few dozen coins left on a microsd that I used for my psp games back in the day, but I haven't seen that card for ages.... Funny thing is at the time I was more upset at losing my monster hunter save data than having to restart mining. otoh, at least I never used fiat to buy, just mined them myself back in the day when asics weren't really the thing.";1;0;False;Talran;dtrrbmf;The last 3 months in 47 seconds.;7v438b;https://v.redd.it/typ8fdslz3e01

bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were designed to be used as a decentralized means of exchange, not a store of value. If you actually believe in the technology behind cryptocurrencies, then you'd realize that the current value of cryptos far exceeds its purported utility. The value is supported by pure speculation. Bitcoin means nothing and has no value if no one is buying anything in cryptocurrency. So few vendors actually take it. And why would you spend it if you think its value is increasing? And why would a vendor take it if its value can decrease overnight? Volatility is not a desirable trait in currency. Crypto as it is now discourages people from spending it and using it for its intended purpose. Anonymity and decentralization's not enough of an incentive for the majority of people to switch from traditional currencies. As it is, someone is going to be left holding a bag of shit just like any other hype based pump and dump schemes.;1;0;False;plaregold;dtsj91c;The last 3 months in 47 seconds.;7v438b;https://v.redd.it/typ8fdslz3e01

"I had economics in university. please stop condescending.

assuming bitcoin gets wide spread its value will stabalize as the speculativ trade volumes will decrease in comparison to purchase transactions. stable value means let's say a deflation of 2%.

the assumption people won't spend and instead hoard everything above their basic needs is a fallacy because it implies that humans main purpose is to accumulate money. at least I wouldn't give up on my vacations for the sake of accumulating 2% more money. inflation just pushes people to spend more than they actually need. (therefore credit bubbles, pollution and faster ressource depletion.)";1;1;False;Hanspanzer;dtqrlxa;The last 3 months in 47 seconds.;7v438b;https://v.redd.it/typ8fdslz3e01

"pants remain unsoiled. Not super stoked, but I have all of my coins locked up in my ledger wallet that's not getting touched for a few years as originally planned. I also ended up putting considerably more cash in over the last month and a half; added DENT, ADA, cV, DBC, PRL, TEL, and a few ICOs. Feeling the pain across every coin this last week :)

I bought some mining hardware and have been getting into that for the time being, it's a fun little hobby and gives me some coin to play around with that doesn't involve putting any more USD in.
