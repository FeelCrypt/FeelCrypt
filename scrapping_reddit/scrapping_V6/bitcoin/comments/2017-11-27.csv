"> I make logic-based statements

Logic isn't worth much if you start with a false premise.

> You didn't address commoditization.

Sellers of goods or services prefer to use a single currency over many. And this is what bitcoin will become: a global, day-to-day currency. It *kind of* is already, but it's not yet as good as it can be.

And while it's easy to clone the codebase, it's very hard to clone the network (and its effects).

Bootstrapping something like bitcoin is hard, that's why these forks even started to give away their forked coins for free (by cloning the bitcoin chainstate).

"Comparing this stuff to beanie babies shows a very high level of ignorance.

Your emotional well-being seems to depend on keeping the belief that you're simply ahead of everyone else, realizing that bitcoin will ultimately fail big time. That you were smart not investing. Or presumably more accurately: that you would've been too smart to invest if you had been here in time when the bitcoin price was double digits. That way you didn't *really* miss a huge opportunity. It's all just some kids gambling with fake money in a collective delusion, a completely unfounded mania.

Ah, yes, I misunderstood you. I disagree. The amount of ones labor is directly correlated to ones likelihood of success. The more labor, the more likely the success.

You are cherry picking by taking a single example in which a largely funded company ended up failing, and trying to use that as a broad example. Except its not a broad example, its a cherry picked example.

"Hi there- 

""So not sure if I will be welcomed to the community as a noob posting on this thread but I gotta say what a hell of a jump! Congrats to you guys!""

thank you. it is really quite the milestone for bitcoin. And of course you are welcome here. We were all noobs at one point or another!

I can't tell you when a good time to buy is, but I will tell you about my bitcoin experience as a noob and hopefully you will be able to learn something from it.

I first heard about bitcoin in 2013 when it was around $100 and like most I ignored it, was skeptical, etc. After I heard it had spiked to $1300 in november 2013 I decided to set up my coinbase account and purchase 1 bitcoin. My first purchase took place on december 26 2013 for around $650 or so. Over the course of the next 2-3 months the bitcoin price began to rise up to $1000, and i ended up investing a significant amount of my savings into btc at around the $800-1000 price range. Throughout all of 2014 the bitcoin price continued to decline, slowly but surely..700,600,500,400,300,200... accompanied by literally hundreds of news articles stating that bitcoin is officially a failed experiment and will go to $0. I was pretty sad to say the least. But.. I continued to buy bitcoin every week during 2014, accumulating more slowly but surely, which helped to lower my average buy in price significantly. What kept me holding and not selling my coins during this depressing time was the fact that I had educated myself and understood the potential of this technology and knew that patience was required..Look at how many years the internet took to evolve into what it is today for example. It's important to understand what you are buying here! Do not buy btc simply for the sake of getting rich quick. take the time to do your research. It's worth it, trust me. 

If you really come to understand bitcoin you'll find that bitcoin is DESIGNED to continuously go up in the long term. If it does not appreciate over time then it WILL fail (im talking 5-10 years time, not annual insane growth like we have seen this year). Read up on the block halving to understand why if you are curious ..it comes down to simple supply and demand. 

Here is a youtube channel link to the best public speaker in the bitcoin community (imo). Andreas Antonopoulos helped me learn about bitcoin. bitcoin can be confusing but he is really great at helping noobs understand. He travels the world and educates people and various governments about bitcoin, and has been doing so for years now. My favorite is the video where he educates the canadian senate about bitcoin, though all his videos are good.

"I'm just getting in now.

Thing is, people have been wondering whether it's too late for *years*. I recently found a forum post a couple of days ago from March 2012 where people were looking back at 2009 and regretting that they didn't get into it a couple of years ago when they were only worth a few cents, if only they could have known how much it would explode, etc. Followed by comforting replies of ""don't worry man, don't beat yourself up over it, there's no way you could have known it would explode like it did"" etc.

Know what the price of bitcoin was in March 2012? About $5.

The truth is, no one can really know whether it's a good or bad idea to get in. But historically, it's only continued to rise - every time it's dipped, it just bounces back even stronger.

Some are speculating that we're still in the ""early adopter"" phase. I guess it just comes down to whether you believe in it long term.

">> If it only ever remained as strictly something to exchange for goods and services, pizza would still cost 10k bitcoins. Due to its scarcity however, and excessive demand, the price is rising.

No I just described what happens with supply and demand.  Nothing in what I said in the previous statement had anything to do with speculation.  It's like first week economics.  If supply is limited and demand is high, price goes up.  

Holy shit have you ever taken a course in economics?

> Gold actually did have a crash of 2013, and slowly lost value over the next two years.

Yes gold does go up and down.  Golf clap to pointing out the obvious.  So does the USD compared to other currencies.  Both are, for all intents and purposes, more stable that BTC. 

By stabilize I mean it doesn't fluctuate 10% a day for a weeks at a time.

No.  That is not what I meant by stabilize.  Stabilize in the sense that it doesn't fluctuate by 50, 100, 500 percent over the course of weeks or months, every other month.  


> People are buying it to ride the wave, not because they care about the ""true"" value of cryptocurrency.

False.  If they are buying it as an investment, speculative as it is, Then they believe it is still due to rise in price.  Whether they are aware of it or not, they are buying because they still believe it is undervalued.  Even if they don't know how to word it correctly.

">Holy shit have you ever taken a course in economics?

I have a bachelor's degree in economics, actually (though I got it ten years ago and work in an unrelated field, so I'm a bit rusty). And my point isn't that there's no demand for bitcoin, obviously there is. The demand is speculation. There's not a single goddamn person on earth buying Bitcoin at $9k because they think it's worth $9k. They're buying it because they think it'll be worth $10k in a few months and they can sell it for a profit. At some point, bitcoin will stop going up. All the speculators will cash out, driving the price down. People will see the price going down, get nervous, and sell, causing the price to go down, and creating a vicious cycle where people sell because people are selling. 

Bitcoin isn't going to, like, get to $12k and stabilize there. It *will* crash. That doesn't mean it's the next beanie babies or anything, it'll just crash to a lower price. Because when the price of a market asset increases by 1,000% in under a year with literally no on-the-ground change to justify it, there's *probably* a bubble. 

>Yes gold does go up and down. Golf clap to pointing out the obvious. So does the USD compared to other currencies. 

I was making a point though. No one uses gold as a currency because the value rockets up and down by an order of magnitude more than fiat currencies do. In 2013, gold saw 33% inflation. In 2017, bitcoin saw -1,000% inflation. And when it crashes, it'll have double-digit inflation. That's terrible for a currency you actually want to use as a currency. Bitcoin is an investment whose price is going up even as that very price movement is making it less effective at what it's supposed to do, because the people buying it aren't planning to use it as a currency; they're planning to flip it for profit. There's incredible deflation now. There'll be incredible inflation later. There'll be a crisis of trust after that because people won't believe btc can stay stable. 

There's a reason I can't walk into a store and buy some shoes with gold bullion, even if I could with Euro or Yen. Because gold moves around too much to be useful as a currency anymore. 

>If they are buying it as an investment, speculative as it is, Then they believe it is still due to rise in price. 

That's literally what I said, rephrased. 

>Whether they are aware of it or not, they are buying because they still believe it is undervalued

No, no no no. They're buying it because they think it'll go up in price in the short term, allowing them to sell at a profit. The ""true value"" of bitcoin is totally irrelevant. I imagine there's a lot of people buying bitcoin believing it's *over*valued, but that it will be even more overvalued next month and as long as they sell before the beer runs out they don't care if Bitcoin is at $1k again in six months. If I were confident bitcoin would rise for three more months and then crash, I'd buy now and sell in two months.

That single transaction is like what, 4$ on BTC?  For a single fucking transaction?  And a fee needs to be spent on every transaction?  We arent talking some bullshit ""convienience fee"" we are talking to literally use the platform.  Any sort of real life transaction fee is imposed by the seller, not the medium.  

>timeframe. 

You get that btc doesnt scale right?  Like at all.  Thats not how math works, unless you guys are banking on hardware to have a giant leap (like giant) in the next few years.  This is honestly something im ignorant of, but you habe to fix the underlying power issue for this even to be considered.

>its worth nothing. 

I never said that.  I said 1 BTC = 1 BTC.  1 house =1 house unless you can find a buyer.  

Its a bubble imo.  A really sexy bubble.  I think people making bank are fine.  I dont think the advocates are fine though, those people are retarded.  

>bitter.  


Hell yea.  I coulda INVESTED in BTC years ago and I didnt.  Hell, I could invest now.  I could also become a Scentsy seller, but I recognize bubbles when I see them.

"You don't actually own anything... You have access to the account which in turn has access to the coins you bought/traded. But the coins in terms of ownership on the blockchain belongs to the exchange, unless you move them in your wallet/to your private keys.

What this means is that in case the exchange goes down, say bye bye to them, or if government orders them to freeze your account, they will just do that. If the coins are under your direct control, than, unless someone coerces you with force to surrender them, nobody can touch them.";2;0;False;crypto-pig;dqdtgh1;It's over 9000!!!;7fkqh5;https://i.imgur.com/jyoZGyW.gifv

"Well, they're going to all take them off at once, because once the first wave hits, the price will go down. Then any competent trader will have a stop-loss set up, so those will start triggering, and the price will go down more and then the average trader will see the prices dropping and panic, and that's how crashes happen. 

Also, a lot of traders are using the same few EAs, so there are a huge amount of traders out there with ""automatically sell if the price falls to $X"" set up, all using the exact same value of X.

A short is essentially an insurance policy on a stock so instead of you making money when it gains value, you make money when you lose value. This is how a few people got extremely rich from the wallstreet crash of 2008. However shorts arent “if it ever falls” its more specific betting like “if it falls between this and this date” and you must pay an insurance fee in order to take out a policy on a stock. Bitcoin is so unpredictable that shorting it would be both very expensive with little return, and also very stupid as it could just as easily keep rising. You short something that you are VERY confident will crash at a certain time so if you know that kmart is doing some deal that you think will fail then you short that before the news of the failure comes in. For the 2008 crash they made so much money because they shorted very stable institutions so it was thought that those instiututions failing was very unlikely so the “insurance policy” was cheap compared to the potential earnings. So just as you only pay say $200 for a $35,000 policy they paid like $300million for a policy in the billions. For bitcoin though its more akin to paying $200 for a $300 policy. Rates of return are low as is predictability. ;1;0;False;avaslash;dqf5khj;This is why I want bitcoin to hit $10,000;7dpypn;https://i.redd.it/fhzsxgcv9nyz.jpg
