"Wake me up when that actually happens.  It still looks to be working fine to me.

Blocks are being produced at an average rate of once every 10 minutes; transactions can be broadcast at will; mathematics still functions as it always did allowing my private keys to generate public keys (and thereby addresses) to receive on that I can then provably show are mine and further transact from... basically, everything is still working exactly as it's supposed to.

So, where's that catastrophic collapse you're talking about? (or do you mean the exchange rate between bitcoin and dollars?  Because that's got to be one of the least important parts of the whole thing.)";0;1;False;dalebewan;ebf6oet;I wonder if we upvote this, is there a chance trading bots get confused and start buying?;a44t1m;https://i.imgur.com/f6TnaFp.gif
I already did but just 20% during the bull run, I used itbit OTC desk, which for withdrawals above 1 million works flawlessly compared to regular exchanges. No slippage, escrow fiat accounts very professional in my experience. Crypto is regulated in my country paid several hundred thousands about 23% in long term capital gain taxes. Life is good and crypto is a wild beast.;1;1;False;pitchbend;ebf1vat;I wonder if we upvote this, is there a chance trading bots get confused and start buying?;a44t1m;https://i.imgur.com/f6TnaFp.gif
"Build something. Make it worthwhile to increase adoption. Complaining about price going up or down does nothing. Build onto the technology. 

Make it so it’s so easy that people (even banked people) prefer to use it to commerce with each other with, over their credit cards. Like email. Andreas Antonopoulos gives a great example how complicated email was than his mom just recently sent an email with a simple slide of the finger. 

Once bitcoin gets there while staying decentralized and cheap, that’s when moon. 
Embrace these down times to build the technology up and not to just keeping asking when, when , when.  

Don’t speculate, build. Bitcoin needs all professions not just coders. It needs better user interface, better storage methods, better marketing, accountants etc... 

You can make a difference if you believe in the technology no matter how small you think your contribution is, it is better than complaining about the price. BUILD and bring the moon to yourself.
