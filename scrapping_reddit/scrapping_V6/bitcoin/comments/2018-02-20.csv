"> Really? Tell that to an online merchant.

That's not cash, thats a debit/credit card/payment service.

Cash refers to coins and notes as opposed to other forms of money.

Do these places not accept cash?

They're only accepting BTC as a gimmick to attract people like yourself who will go out of their way to spend it for no practical reason which is not a sustainable or realistic use case.

If you dig a little deeper into the trade flows of ""spend and replace"" it becomes obvious why it won't help bitcoin replace fiat.


>But I replace what I spend because I believe the long term outlook for BTC is bright.

If you buy your BTC back from an exchange, and the person you gave it sold it on an exchange (which they're going to because no business wants to keep its cashflow in a volatile speculative asset), what's the net result?";1;1;False;suninabox;duk161k;Bitcoin Doesn't Give a Fuck.;7yaaz2;https://v.redd.it/ty2y74gawug01
"> Most of the people who have an underlying interest in Bitcoin's technology and goals, as opposed to new money treating it as a get-rich-quick scheme, have abandoned the legacy Core chain and these censored discussions by now.

I'm literally only here because I'm interested in Bitcoin as a technology and idea. While I currently hold Bitcoin, I'm unable to fucking use it because Bitcoin in its current form is unusable as a currency. Nobody accepts and it has no store of value. Bitcoin is a poorly thought out currency that has no understanding of (or at least was not designed using) fundamental economic principles as pertaining to currency. Bitcoin is a commodity now, not a currency, and there's no chance of that changing in the near future. And sure, some people might accept payment in Bitcoin, same as how some people will accept payment in gold, but neither are currencies as a result.

So thanks for insulting me and impugning my motives because you believe yourself to be some kind of hipster purist, asshole. 

> Free market capitalism is manifest in Bitcoin. 

The bullshit you're spouting is not ""Free market capitalism"". Free market capitalism fundamentally requires having a currency that all parties are using for common exchange. One can not have a free market without a government protecting, supporting, and facilitating the market. 

> Manipulated by free people acting in their own rational economic self interest, initiating force against no person or their property. I have no problem with that. Go for it. I understand the inherent feedback mechanisms in the Bitcoin protocol to feel no need to discourage it.

Fair enough, I suppose, though I find it odd that you're OK with individual people or corporations manipulating *an entire currency* purely in order to enrich themselves, but a government that is (supposedly) sworn to protect and govern a society manipulating a currency is somehow problematic. 

> Eh, you're just triggered at this point because someone has a different opinion to you founded on strong moral principles. Acknowledging that your worldview is founded upon the belief that the perpetual threat of violence by a treasonous central authority is benevolent must be challenging, I understand why you're attacking me instead. Given the subreddit we're in, perhaps I should respond in kind by suggesting that you avoid talking about Bitcoin because of your approach, which is either extraordinarily misguided or downright malicious.

You conflated the notion of having a federal reserve with the concept of fractional reserve banking, you thought that fiat currencies are ""backed by force"", and you think the reason that I'm attacking you is because I disagree with your opinions? I don't care about your opinions, I care about the fact that you either don't know or don't care about basic economics. This subreddit has enough delusional people who are fundamentally misinformed, and I'm just trying to correct one instance of that. This entire thread started because you thought fractional reserve banking and a central government having a single currency were somehow the same thing. 

And might I point out that I was not actually ""attacking you"" - I was pointing out that the things you state have no basis in reality. There's a difference. As an example, taxation exists because you choose to live in the USA and enjoy the services that the US government provides you. You have to pay for those services, and you pay for it through taxation. Therefore, the taxation is justified - it is (post de facto) payment for services rendered. You're free to not receive those services, though - just leave the USA and resign citizenship of the US, and you will neither receive the services nor be required to pay for them. But for some reason, you have a problem with doing that, too. As I have stated, you don't get to be the beneficiary of services and also claim that requiring payment for those services ""is unjust"". This is what I mean by ""the things you state have no basis in reality"". 

Also this sentence:

>  Acknowledging that your worldview is founded upon the belief that the perpetual threat of violence by a treasonous central authority is benevolent must be challenging, I understand why you're attacking me instead.

is hilarious. You're accusing the entire government of treason? Treason towards what, exactly? You yourself don't seem to want to pay taxes or otherwise support the society you live in, so what exactly is the treason going on here? You've repeatedly used the word treasonous is contexts that have made me raise my eyebrows, but I've ignored it until now. Seriously, what do you think the meaning of the word ""treason"" even is? 

And yes, I happen to believe that the world is a better place with governments as opposed to without them. I've seen what happens in places without functioning governments, and I very much prefer the places that have government. Are all governments perfect? Nope. Is the one I currently live in perfect? Not even close. But I very much prefer the government I currently live in to a state of anarchy (and I'm using the word anarchy purely in its definition of ""a state of having no government), mostly because I have borne witness to what people do in states of anarchy.

">I believe BTC will be more valuable in the long term, so I take my position accordingly. 

That's by definition a speculative position. 

Why expect anyone is buying bitcoin for reasons different to yourself? You're not buying bitcoin based on what you think its worth today, but what you think it might be worth in the future. If everyone does this you very quickly get a price completely divorced from its actual value, since fixed supply means any increase in demand, for any reason, will increase price

Then speculators use this as a self-fulfilling prophecy, ""bitcoin must be valuable in the future otherwise why would anyone keep paying so much money for it?""

>I think the metric most applicable would be merchant sales in BTC, expressed in a fiat denomination. That would both eliminate exchange traffic, and account for price fluctuation. I leave finding such information as an exercise for the reader.

Top 500 retailers works as the most practical proxy for this number since this number is not publicly available.

Sales records aren't public records, counting up hundreds of tiny retailers who might have listed bitcoin as an experiment who have barely any sales. A single one of the top 500 retailers likely accounts for more traffic than the rest put together.

>they accept the minimal risk of double spend in exchange for expediency. I've ordered food from 3 different places in my area, and not a single one made me wait for a confirmation... 

The expediency of what? being slower and less widely accepted than cash? Cash has a 0% chance of not going through.

I'm guessing you're in Silicon Valley or some other place where its being done as an experiment if there are 3 different places in your area accepting bitcoin.

You guessed wrong.  I hail from the vicinity around Detroit.  My local bitcoin meetup goes to different BTC-accepting places every week.  Detroit area isn't exactly the tech-experiment mecca, friend.  These are all mom-and pop restaurants....  and that's not even counting the online orders, the smoke shops...

Really? Tell that to an online merchant.

Sure, I am invested in BTC for speculative reasons, but also because I _want_ the tech to survive.  That's more why I spend at the restaurants... I want to encourage those merchants.

"Or, and I'm just spitballing here, they accept BTC because the owner wants to accumulate more...  

they see value in it....

or maybe the owner also wants to encourage the BTC ecosystem and are accepting it for more altruistic reasons.

I don't care the reason that they accept it, I just want to encourage more and more places _to_ accept it.

They absolutely wouldn't have my business if they didn't accept BTC, so it's income they earned that they wouldn't have had elsewise.

And your assumption that no business is going to retain BTC is unfounded... surely the intersection of those who wish to accumulate more BTC and those who run businesses is not zero.";1;1;False;AManInBlack2017;duk54xr;Bitcoin Doesn't Give a Fuck.;7yaaz2;https://v.redd.it/ty2y74gawug01
