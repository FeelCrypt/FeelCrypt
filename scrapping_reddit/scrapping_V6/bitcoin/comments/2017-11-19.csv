Yes, see my other comments where I explain this.

Miners do the work under the premise that coins will be created at a predictable decreasing rate. Changing that on the fly will not happen.

No, like I said, it's not at all likely. The reason I point it out is because multiplying everyone's balance by 10 as well as the hardcap by 10 is, programmatically, the only way to add another decimal place. Since a satoshi cannot be made smaller, you must make Bitcoins smaller and give everyone more of them. Then a Satoshi becomes nine decimal places of a Bitcoin.";2;1;False;ianpaschal;dq1i2xn;This is why I want bitcoin to hit $10,000;7dpypn;https://i.redd.it/fhzsxgcv9nyz.jpg
"https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/19661/how-is-bitcoin-infinitely-divisible

 > If there is a need for them, additional decimal places can be added with concensus of the network. This is why some refer to ""infinite"" divisibility, because we can select the level that we need as time goes on.

> The current level selected in the code (by Satoshi) is 8 decimal places (1 satoshi = 0.00000001 BTC) hence the nickname for the smallest unit currently possible for bitcoin today.

Also a very old discussion about this: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=8657.0

So yes, you are correct in the sense that is the current set limit and current consensus, however that is not the ultimate limit of divisibility and more decimal points can be added if there is demand for it.

"Oh! I recall from some 6-7 years ago that it was spoken that it is essentially GUI limitation.

However, that does not limit subdivision if it is read as each byte representing a fraction, ie first decimal point is first byte, second decimal point is second byte etc. You simply add bytes to the end.

I am 100% certain that back then the talk was that BTC is in essence infinitely divisible, but for the moment limited as makes no sense to have more decimal points. This was back when 1BTC was worth like 0.05‚Ç¨.

By the time 1BTC is $1mil, I don't think we'll need to introduce a fork.  Partly because a penny is already worthless and will be worth even less by that time, and partly because of the above.

"> Then we agree. Although it's programatically the only way...on the main chain. LN and sidechains should be capable of handling more precise values. Already today some exchanges use additional decimal places and round up when they settle on the main chain.

Yup, true, but as for the original statement that this could simply be changed with a soft fork is completely wrong. Also that a satoshi is merely a cosmetic division of a Bitcoin unit. (Side note: are these the same people who have been vehemently fighting a holy war over other Bitcoin technical issues? Yikes.)

Not sure I understand your second statement though: By the time 1 BTC is $1m, then satoshis will absolutely start to matter. Pennies get more and more worthless because of inflation but Bitcoin is insanely deflationary meanings pennies/satoshis are *the* future of Bitcoin.

> Even if a hard fork is needed, that isn't the kind of thing that's likely to cause contention. It's been talked about before. It's doable. If it's becoming necessary everyone will likely be on board.

I'm willing to bet you it absolutely would cause contention. Especially because people are so attached to the idea of hard caps and clearly don't understand anything about what value a bitcoin or satoshi actually is storing.
