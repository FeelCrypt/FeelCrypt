"In the very early days of bitcoin around 2009-2011 (early 2011), you could just mine them by downloading a client and leaving it running. This client would use your computer's CPU to run a mathematical algorithm (which serves no purpose aside from validating transactions really). You would then be rewarded with bitcoins. Once 2011 came, mining switched over to GPUs since they were far faster and more efficient than CPUs. A few years later in 2013-2014 time period, ASIC machines (Application Specific Intergrated Circuit) took over and mining became far more centralized.
Nowadays most BTC is mined in enormous data centers filled with ASIC machines (which cost about 4000-5000 each and take about 6 months to pay off their value). The issue with this is that it centralizes the wealth and power of BTC in the hands of a few people, which is the complete opposite of a ""decentralized"" currency. The problem with this? When people don't agree, they just leave and take their processing power with them (which is being used to validate transactions and ensure the book is legitimate). Hence why there are so many ""forks"", though segwit 2x was cancelled.
Early users would get 50 bitcoins very quickly to reward early adopters and you could mine literally hundreds/thousands of bitcoins in a week (Bitcoin is around $7000 at the moment). In 2009, 1000-1500 bitcoins were worth about $1. Today they would be worth between $7-10.5 million. In 2010, people were trying to sell bitcoin too. Famous stories such as the guy who tried to sell 10,000 BTC for $50 (worth $70 million today and no one bought it from him) or the guy who traded 10,000 BTC for pizza are well known in the crypto community. If you left your computer running the client for a month in 2009 or early 2010 and never touched those coins until today, you'd probably easily clear $50 million.
Hindsight is 20/20. BTC was a brand new and no one knew back then would turn into a revolutionary technology. The vast majority of BTC mined back then was sold at far lower prices ($1, 5, 10, 100, etc etc). Several million BTC were also lost since there were no online wallets back then, just hardware ones. Many people threw out their BTC because they considered it ""worthless"". A lot of 50 BTC wallets are now just ""lost"", each of them worth over $300,000.
Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of BTC, has the most BTC at over 1.1 million (more than most exchanges combined), which is worth over $7 billion today. However these coins are considered sort of ""lost"" since Satoshi hasn't moved them or even touched them since 2009. His public addresses are well known, so people would know if the coins start moving. The crypto market is abuzz when a very large stack of BTC from 2009-early 2010 starts moving since that means old coins are moving back into circulation rather than just being considered ""lost"".
