"The problem with trusting the value of Bitcoins is that there's very little difference between it and any of the competitors, other than user base. That includes traditional banking, which have a hell of a lot more resources than the developers of Bitcoin, and who will lower the cost of transactions if ever Bitcoins become a competitive threat.

I mean, bully for Bitcoin if that happens and money becomes more liquid, but isn't the energy cost of updating the blockchain on everyone's computer going to make using Bitcoin environmentally damaging?

"Not OP, but I can answer.

It's the largest and oldest. Now this may seem like a logical fallacy at first whiff, but what it means is that BTC is anti-fragile. A currency and/or store of value must be resilient and secure, above all else. 

BTC has clawed back from 5 or so major crashes in value, each time the trough was higher than the previous peak. It has also fought off several contentious hard forks that can be considered hostile takeovers for all intents and purposes. 

This also means that in the past 8 years, no major fault has been found and exploited in the software. People can count on Bitcoin. 

And in being the largest coin, Bitcoin attracts the best developers. It's always been an open source project, and development continues to grow, with exciting second-level technologies on the horizon like Lightning Network and Schnorr Signatures. These will allow Bitcoin to scale to larger and larger throughputs.";14;2;False;TJ11240;dqcl4hg;It's over 9000!!!;7fkqh5;https://i.imgur.com/jyoZGyW.gifv
"I might get downvoted for saying this on a bitcoin sub, but as of right now bitcoin isn't a great option for any use other than holding it as a 'digital gold'. The main problem with BTC atm is the amount of transactions that come with BTC getting more mainstream is far more than original system was designed to handle. The 1mb block size can contain only about 1000 tx's per block. Because of this, essentially to pay miners a fee to include your tx in their block. With larger amounts, this is less of a problem because the fee will be naturally be large. But if you try to send $5 in bitcoin to pay for a meal, you will pay $4 to the miners as a fee to include your tx in their block. in short, it is incredibly expensive to move BTC around but holding it in  one wallet is obviously paying dividends right now. 

 The main proponent that bitcoin has is first mover advantage. Essentially, the problems that bitcoin has won't matter in the long run because of how known/sought after bitcoin is right now. It is the oldest crypto and probably the most profitable to own long term. This coupled with the fact that it is the only way to buy most other cryptos means that it is here to stay.

If you are interested in learning more about other Cryptos that don't struggle with these problems, then I suggest reading up on /r/CryptoCurrency ";38;6;False;kars4kidz;dqclumx;It's over 9000!!!;7fkqh5;https://i.imgur.com/jyoZGyW.gifv

"Bitcoin has survived everything that has been thrown at it for just about a decade now. Bitcoin has pedigree, it has a proven reputation of security, and it is the premier store of wealth. Not to mention it is crypto reserve, is the most widely used and recognised globally, has a very solid road map ahead to become much cheaper and faster, more private, and flexible enough for Bitcoin powered smart contracts. It also has the biggest user and developer community by far. 

All these other competing cryptos don't stand a chance once Bitcoin undergoes a few more protocol upgrades which will be happening sooner than we think. Pay no mind to temporarily expensive transactions, they're being fully addressed in the lightning network upgrade.

"> But can you please explain to me why bitcoin is the best option out of all other crypto currencies currently?

The most robust development team combined with first mover network effects. Adam Back the creator of hashcash, credited by Satoshi in the Bitcoin white paper as the backbone for bitcoins proof of work system runs a company named blockstream that pays the salaries of open source Bitcoin developers. There are more heavy hitter cryptographers working for Bitcoin than any other crypto. These people are on the forefront of creating new technologies that will allow such a complex decentralized system to maximize it's potential.

That's not to say there is not talent elsewhere in the field, there definitely is, cryptocurrencies are a hot new industry that is attractive to developers and math academics. 

Nick Szabo, also cited in the white paper is a major Bitcoin proponent and proselytizes about the power of ethereums smart contracts. But ETH is very different from BTC, they are experimenting with a new proof of stake system to go away from mining in 2018 ...it's a risky endeavor that has large upsides if it succeeds.  The downside to eth is the massive amount of currency it has minted, making it not nearly as scarce as Bitcoin. If Bitcoin is gold, eth is copper (still quite valuable).

There are other promising cryptocurrencies like Dash Monero and zcash that offer greater privacy guarantees over what Bitcoin currently offers which means that they do have a fundamental advantage over Bitcoin in terms of fungibility. The best of these in that the system that provides the best cryptographic guarantees is Monero. The problem with Monero is in order to offer the Privacy guarantees it requires much more in terms of resources for storing it's blockchain.

The problem with all decentralized currencies is that the more resources they require the more centralizing effects that occur on the nodes that must carry the blockchain data. Monero is going to be massively larger than Bitcoin. If it takes 10 terabytes to store the data on a node then you're not going to have average people running nodes and if you don't have average people running nodes then it's not really decentralized.

The great thing about Bitcoin is that it can adopt and mold itself after all of these improvements created by other coins to a certain extent. Take rootstock for example which is launching in a few weeks which will allow ethereum style contracts on the Bitcoin Network.

And there was a new paper released by some Bitcoin developers that demonstrated a new type of proof that will allow the blinding of amounts sent on the public Ledger. Combining this now proof system with already existing coinjoin mixing technologies will allow people to increase privacy. Once the Bitcoin network is upgraded to a upcoming feature called MAST and schnorr signatures we will see these types of privacy transactions be incredibly cost and resource efficient and also look exactly like normal transaction so it is impossible to distinguish which transaction is attempting to maximize privacy.

 So the two biggest selling points of ethereum and other privacy enhanced cryptos like Montero Dash and zcash will be features integrated into Bitcoin, likely 2018. This fact combined with the most advanced development team and continued first-mover Advantage is what makes Bitcoin pretty darn Bulletproof. Also consider that Bitcoin has the strongest proof of work security by very very very far.";1;0;False;Cryptolution;dqd1ez3;It's over 9000!!!;7fkqh5;https://i.imgur.com/jyoZGyW.gifv

While /u/etan_ashman has a point about it's inability to effect BTC itself, there are a few strong arguments as to how harming net neutrality will also harm cryptocurrency.

I have followed BTC since the beginning. I never really had a need for being on the Silk Road, so inherently I saw BTC as a novelty and a nifty idea.  I once thought it was cool that you could turn your PC on and make money (through mining) but at the time the electricity costs far outmeasured the gains (still relevant for average dudes).

At this point I look at BTC closing in on 10k and thinking ""this has to be to bubble bursting right?""


God damn it. I thought that same thing since 3k.  When will this madness end?  Leveraging into all crypto seems to still be ""early"". I only hope I'm right.  Fuck it.

"At somepoint it will stop and correct.  Yes. But once the market realizes what the true value is, it will automatically adjust to that point.  It will happen quick.  

In the grand scheme of things, bitcoin is still only worth 1/19,000 of all coins, banknotes, and deposit accounts in the entire world.  As a global currency and store of value that has no government bounds and can be traded near instantaneously anywhere inthe world ... it may still be undervalued.  I can still realistically see it going to a money supply in USD to 300-500k in the very near future.

"Short term I think it MAYBE over valued at this point in time but I've always thought it is a 50K asset since I first learned about it around $1.50. The thing is I don't think what we're seeing now isn't mainstream adoption IMO it's mainstream speculation driven by the rising price & media coverage which will eventually end a bubble of epic proportions then mainstream will declare it a failed experiment as it works on it's scaling. Not sure what would be best for real bitcoin adoption but a bubble as big as this could go may not be great for shorter term adoption.

The tech works fine as it is but I'm not sure if we can scale with adoption that quickly, assuming people actually use it for something. Even storing/moving your own coins with current rate of increase in 'users' should fill up the blockspace, if a company like amazon starts accepting it then things could get crowded pretty quickly and scaling isn't a sure thing yet.

"Sure they created value! Let me explain just one of the ways:  risk taking

If you think that bitcoin is volatile and risky now...you should have experienced it back then.  A miner had so very little reason to expect that this obscure, geeky project was going to go anywhere, and certainly wasn't likely to intellectually reward them for spending a good deal of time and allocating their computing equipment and using their electricity (everything has opportunity costs); let alone remunerate them monetarily.

See, bootstrapping a network good, like a foundational protocol or a money, is subject to coordination problems: free-riding and lack of assurance can cause the thing to be under-produced. That's part of the genius of the lottery-like nature of the block-reward system and the price volatility which comes with the heavy speculation on this proto-money we call bitcoin. The (often ideologically-driven) risk-taking of early bitcoiners, node-operators and miners, combined with the lottery-like incentives of the system; produce rewards fairly commensurate with the risks taken (e.g. that everyone will free ride and/or not adopt and demand the token), so that it is just adequately-enough produced (I.e. the securing of the network takes place and the token achieves a liquid and ever-more-stabilizing exchange value, until such point as the token can begin to serve as a unit of account and better store of value, in addition to being a medium of exchange).

All of us from the early days have had to deal with years of scorn and deaf ears, in addition to the time and money and resources that we've spent, and risks taken, to build bitcoin businesses or services, invest in and hold the currency through all the wild swings, mine it ...things have gotten a lot easier and more user friendly for new entrants in almost all aspects (I'll exclude mining from being ""easier"" as startup costs are extremely high here).

Edit: Tl;dr  bitcoin has value (mostly future value, hence the predominance of speculative activities over consumer spending) because the ""good"" is not the singular token, but the network effect of bitcoin users...people with whom to transact: a medium of indirect exchange: money, and more particularly, stateless or market-based money.";2;0;False;kwanijml;dqcmvxa;It's over 9000!!!;7fkqh5;https://i.imgur.com/jyoZGyW.gifv

"Well, obviously, bitcoin can't rapidly rise forever. At some point, it'll go down by some amount. 

Is Bitcoin *really* four times as big now as it was back in May? Is the shooting up in value *really* a reflection of the fundamental market forces below bitcoin? Or are there are a lot of speculators pushing the price up? 

At some point, you might see, say, Bitcoin crash to $3000, and then be back up to $4200 a week later and rise slowly from there (a lot of times, when something crashes, it crashes too hard and shoots back some of the way up). Or maybe it'll go up to like $40,000 next year and crash *real* hard. Or maybe it'll have a soft pop to like $6000. Maybe it gets to $X in value and then flatlines for a long enough that all the speculators pull out. But it certainly won't be quadrupling in value every eight months. At some point between now and the heat death of the universe, shorting bitcoin will be a real good idea.

"If Bitcoin Cash adoption was growing at a similar rate, their blocks would fill up relatively soon as well ;-)

Part of the issue with scaling block size linearly with transaction volume (i.e. with adoption) is that adoption is currently growing exponentially at a much faster rate than network/computing capabilities. Bumping up the block size *would* reduce transaction fees, but it is a temporary bandage which has the potential to worsen decentralization. To support decentralized microtransactions and nanotransactions in the future at VISA+scale, off-chain recordkeeping is an absolute necessity.";1;1;False;farsightxr20;dqcpf54;It's over 9000!!!;7fkqh5;https://i.imgur.com/jyoZGyW.gifv

"At the moment that is true, it is an unstable currency in its infancy, and it is not ready for widespread adoption yet. The network could not even process enough transactions for people to be making everyday purchases with the current number of users. 

I think as more people adopt bitcoin it will be sink or swim and the necessary changes will be implemented or they won't be and maybe a new crypto will take its place. If it does get to the point of widespread adoption then the volatility we see now would no longer be an issue. There might be price fluctuations same as there are with the US dollar but with bitcoin it would be deflationary instead of inflationary.

"I'm positive they do, hence why every second person is super posi and encouraging others to buy in ""don't worry you don't even have to buy a full coin!"". Obviously not shills, but they sure are selling it, perhaps out of fear and not genuine encouragement for people to ""get rich"". The only value comes from more people buying in, so it reeks of desperation in here. Not that that's a bad thing, I've got my 1 singular BTC, just the same as any other shares I've invested in, which could turn into junk overnight.

"This is a paste of something I wrote recently but needs to be extended to cover more history. 

In 2015 a debate gained steam about increasing transaction capacity. The ""easiest"" way was to increase the max block size by causing a hard fork of the network. A couple former developers abandoned the consensus process and turned to populist tactics instead through a series of blog posts. At the time, most users were unaware that hard forking will almost always result in multiple block chains (Ethereum Classic, Bcash, Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Clashic). The blog posts stirred up a lot of panic within portions of the community who were not so technically inclined, or refused to believe many prominent Bitcoin developers. 

The two former developers deployed code which would trigger a hard fork for anyone running the BitcoinXT client. At the same time, /r/Bitcoin instituted a policy against promoting clients which would cause a hard fork without broad consensus. This caused a substantial uproar. A number of users left for \/r/bitcoinxt and began attacking this subreddit on a daily basis. Since then, /r/Bitcoin has needed to employ rather strict moderation policies in order to keep the sub readable and free of disruptive players. There have been periods of over-moderation, but we have always tried to keep an even keel while also maintaining the subreddit's policies. 

Eventually it was widely determined that BitcoinXT was a pretty horrible idea. But the debate had shifted from ""how to increase transaction capacity"" to ""how to cause the network to hard fork regardless of consensus"", which is exactly what this sub wanted to prevent. After all, Bitcoin is only as strong as the people who believe in it, all of whom agree about the network's consensus rules. Attempting the subvert those rules without broad agreement by network participants is viewed as a malicious act. 

Over time, it didn't make any sense for those detractors to continue hanging around in \/r/bitcoinxt. Roger Ver acquired the \/r/btc sub and started promoting his website as alternative forums where promoting hard forks without consensus would be permitted. Roger used this subreddit's strict moderation policies as a marketing tactic by making broad accusations of censorship which continue to this day. Later came Bitcoin Classic, Bitcoin Unlimited, and btc1, all of which had very substandard developer teams and scoffed at any kind of peer review or technical criticism. 

Each and every attempt to fork the Bitcoin network without broad consensus has been a miserable failure. Each attempt has seen more and more deceptive tactics by those trying to force the network to fork. And each attempt has also taught the community about how crucial broad consensus is, which is why many people appear so defensive against entities who try to fork the network without any technical necessity. The fact that Bitcoin is very difficult to change is a good thing. 

Bitcoin developers were able to roughly double the max block size with the Segwit *soft fork* which activated a few months ago after almost a year of delays. Roger Ver, Jihan Wu and several other high profile people tried very hard to prevent Segwit from activating, which is ironic given that Segwit provides up to 2x increase in transaction capacity (the original foundation of this debate), as well as fixes various other protocol weaknesses, and also lays the groundwork for Layer 2 payment networks such as Lightening Network. Segwit adoption must continue to increase in order to see these effects. Users, wallets and companies need to evolve alongside the protocol, rather than trying to force changes to the protocol which only serve their particular business models. 

On August 1st, Segwit became locked in and activated two weeks later. But Jihan and Roger decided to clone the Bitcoin block chain to a new altcoin they called ""Bitcoin Cash"". Naturally they've received heavy criticism due to misleading branding, and Roger has even gone so far as to publish articles claiming that ""Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin"". This is why I personally refer to the altcoin as Bcash. It's less confusing for new users. Unfortunately this new altcoin has caused some instability in hashrate on the Bitcoin network since they did not change the PoW algorithm, and has also experienced substantial pump-and-dump behavior. We don't know how many people traded their Bitcoins for Bcash, but it appears there are a number of people who are financially invested in causing Bcash to surpass Bitcoin in hopes of taking the Bitcoin brand recognition for themselves. 

When Segwit2x/btc1/B2X/NYA/Garzik failed to gain consensus a couple weeks ago, we all expected that the road would be clear to continue focusing on Bitcoin without distractions, but the opposite was true. We've seen paid astroturfing, [compromised accounts and botnet voting](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7cyj7o/i_just_got_257_downvotes_in_8_minutes_for_calling/) like never before. Of course, given \/r/btc's history of deceptive behavior, their most recent attempt to defame this subreddit's mods and a premier Bitcoin developer was to accuse us of carrying out an attack against this very subreddit, then blaming them for the attack. You know all that stuff about paid Russian trolls influencing social media? I was very skeptical myself, but it turns out the clickfarm attacking us was in Brazil.

Thankfully, most people saw through this propaganda, but many saw a wall of text and assumed it must be hard evidence of wrongdoing. So now we're being witch-hunted when we would rather be focusing on learning more about the protocol itself. 

It's my position that since Bcash exists, Roger Ver and his followers have their own block chain, their own forums, their own website. Many of them have attacked this subreddit's moderation and userbase constantly for two years. They're no longer welcome to participate in this forum if they cannot do so in good faith. Bitcoin will continue to grow and evolve without them. I'm confident of that. 

So yeah, I probably skipped about 98% of the drama, but hope that helps. Maybe I'll actually use this as a starting point for a wiki page. If you have any feedback or followup questions, shoot them over and I'll get back to you as time allows. ";14;1;False;BashCo;dqcw4sk;It's over 9000!!!;7fkqh5;https://i.imgur.com/jyoZGyW.gifv

"There's no true way to know what the currency will do. 


However I will offer these facts: There will only ever be 21 million bitcoin (BTC), many yet to be mined, and some already lost. It is a currency that completely bypasses the need for exchange rates or bank fees (though it has its own fees), so if you want to send money to your friends or support a cause in any country, no big deal. BTC is divisible to 8 decimal places so you can buy 1 BTC for $9000, or 0.1 for $900, or 0.01 for $90. These are facts about BTC.

My own comments about BTC: since investing from just earlier this year my return on investment is 229%. I finally have a safety net of savings, something I've never had in my life. My only regret is not doubling down earlier,  but I had bills to pay. Invest what you can afford to lose,  and what you can afford to not see again for at least a year.  That's my suggestion. Holding for a year should lower your capital gains taxes. Don't try and day trade or short or anything.  Just put money in at regular intervals,  every week or every month and start saving up. Use BTC whenever you can,  but remember there will be taxes to consider. 

BTC is entirely worth it in my mind.  When the dust settles on this 9k goal,  it will most likely drop,  and slowly rise back up, just look at the other all time highs. 

If you buy, do your research, find an exchange that has minimal or no fees. Not to shill,  but I'm using gdax, which is owned by Coinbase. Coinbase has an easy interface, with high fees. I suggest starting there,  buying a small amount,  and learning how to manage that small amount.  If it is for you,  try GDAX. Gdax has all the trading tools you want,  but is more complex,  with basically no fees. 

Always move your coins off an exchange. Learn about hardware wallets. At minimum have your wallet on your pc or laptop, and consider a cold storage wallet like trezor.

Is it too late?  No one can be sure.  Many said BTC was dead at $600. Many speculate it could be worth 10 times what is at right now, or more.

Guess what,  ITS STILL CHEAP!  Bitcoin has a long way to go and you only need to buy what you can afford to lose.  You don't have to buy 1 bitcoin completely, you can buy a fraction of a bitcoin and that will also accumulate in value. Bitcoin is deflationary and we have never had a money that could do and prove this. And you only have to trust math. ;23;0;False;iiJokerzace;dqcmd6s;It's over 9000!!!;7fkqh5;https://i.imgur.com/jyoZGyW.gifv
"Make a coinbase account and set up weekly buys for what you spend on scratchoffs. Skip a night out and put the $50 you would spend into bitcoin instead. Once the CME group starts futures trading traditional investors will start dipping their toes in and you still have a chance to be an early adopter. 

For what its worth I downloaded a bitcoin wallet onto my phone back in 2013 when I first heard about it but I was young and realized I needed a debit card to buy and did not want to go through the trouble, then I hear about it this year and i already knew the basics about it so i jumped in headfirst and 1800 was a tough hurdle to jump too with the wannacry ransomware attack giving bad press and it was after a large runup from $1000. 
If you are going to gamble do it on bitcoin not on scratch offs. 

Once you learn bitcoin that opens up avenues to all the other crypto currencies and there is alot of money to be made there and also alot of money to be lost.

You'd purchase, but then it would be best to transfer out of whatever exchange website and to an actual Bitcoin wallet. 

Software or hardware wallet generates a set of words you write down and store securely. These are used to generate all the rest of your keys. This Mnemonic phrase becomes your ""cold storage"", ""paper wallet"".

If it dips to 7k and I buy 100,000 worth and it spikes to 8k again.

14 coins worth 7k turns into a profit of 14k which means 2 more shares the next time you do it.

Doing this over and over is much more profitable than doing it once and sitting on it for a year and affords you a large gain when it peaks at 9k instead of stopping at 8.5.

I was using btc quite a bit in the past few years and although this spike is great I doubt it will last long. Value is based off market usage and I really doubt the surge is from people who genuinely will be using it day to day. The hype will die eventually and the price will go down.

"A couple hundred dollars in mid-2015 would've got you a full Bitcoin, and that would be worth $9k today. Bitcoin _could_ go to $100k each. Or $1M. Or $0. So, it depends which you think is more likely.

Word of advice, though--if you do buy, commit. Don't invest more than you can afford, and once you've invested--hold. The price can crash. I've seen it fall by 50% several times, and I feel like we may be due. When it first hit $1100, it turned and fell to $250. A whole lot of people who were invested then panicked, sold, and lost money. And then it stayed low for _years_, and a lot of people must've given up hope and sold. Those that held won in the long run.

If you believe cryptocurrency is a fad then don't invest, it's too risky and too stressful.

"If $500 is a lot of money to you, you could space it out into two purchases. $250 now, then $250 maybe 5-6 months from now. There's a threshold on Coinbase of about $200 to pay the lowest fee of 1.5% (instead of the minimum fee of $3), so that's a good number to use for dollar-cost averaging if you can. I highly recommend reading about dollar-cost averaging because it reduces timing risk during crazy speculative runs like Bitcoin is currently experiencing.

"Best to not get your financial advice on reddit but having said that, buying $500 on coinbase and leaving it for year is fine. Ideally you spend at least some time actually figuring out what this thing you bought and take possession of your bitcoin. you can read more about that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/498520/why_the_bitcoin_rules_cant_change_reading_time/). I like to advocate buying small amounts (not $500 but maybe $5 or $50) gradually so you can get used to the price swings and get to understand what you just bought.


Bitcoin works like a dollars  in some ways but in other ways it is different. One way that is is different is the absolutely immutability of transactions. If you spend some money with a credit card you can do a charge back. If you pay for something with a check you can take legal means to get the money back. There is literally no way to actually reverse a bitcoin transaction and whoever holds the private keys actually owns the bitcoin. Coinbase is fine because it is a FDIC insured bank and has a great track record... but technically an insider could take a bunch of the bitcoin and there is technically no way to get them back. Or there could be some screw up and they lose the private keys. Whoops.";3;0;False;kaiser13;dqcpb09;It's over 9000!!!;7fkqh5;https://i.imgur.com/jyoZGyW.gifv

"People say that cryptocurrency has the signs of a bubble and expect it to crash like the original tech bubble, but I think it's a bad comparison. That's not to say that there isn't a bubble happening right now, but it's not where skeptics say it is. 

Back in the 90's, that original tech bubble was created by a change in institutional standards for taking companies public that resulted in companies going public with no established profitability or honestly reason for existence. Those taking them public often didn't care, largely because of the proliferation of illegal market manipulation that would let them pump a stock's initial valuation and then get out.

That should sound familiar, because that is the landscape for ICOs right now. It's a minefield of fraud and half-baked ideas, many of which somehow still garner interest. Now *that* is where I think the bubble is, and where we'll see an impact once things pop. Either regulation or disaster (or both) is going to make it much harder to get interest in a new coin.

But cryptocurrency on the whole? That's the technology, like the computer. The tech bubble bursting hit tech industry businesses, not the computer itself. So this bubble will pop, the shitcoins will die, the rest will take a hit, and then it'll level out.

Unless you live in Zimbabwe or some other country with an incredibly unstable currency then that simply isn't true.

I'm not suggesting that you are suicidal of course, but from one stranger to another, the grass currently seems much greener on the side that we're on right now because the price is still seemingly rising.

However, if you look at it from the point of view of what has my Bitcoin position meant to my actual ability to buy things in the real world right now, then you must take conversion to fiat into consideration. Right now fiat is what we all need to buy most of the things we need (like it or not).That's why people are obsessed with converting it to USD. They are not long term traders and want to lock in real world profits. In that context, you don't ""make"" money until its locked in to your fiat of choice.

"Yes, Coinbase is a custodian, they have the amount of bitcoin you are owed (an IOU really) in their database, and they have their own hot and cold wallets. You can send the bitcoin out to your own wallet, where you have the keys, and then you have custody. How that works is the blockchain is public. You make up a bitcoin address to send it to. You tell Coinbase to send to a bitcoin address and they will. They broadcast that send to address message to nodes who get it to miners. Miners mine your transaction into a block. Now it's on a public blockchain. Your wallet spots the bitcoins arriving at an address it controls. The address is usually a kind of public key, and you have a corresponding private key to go with it. They look like big strings of numbers and letters. The public one will begin with a 1 or a 3. The private one should begin with a 5 - never share that one. Your wallet can make linked groups of addresses with a ""seed"" - usually 12 or 24 special words that the wallet software will tell you to write down. It can recreate everything if you can keep the seed safe. So since that's so special, you need to keep it safe. Hand write it, don't let it touch a computer. Or punch it into steel if you worry about fire. There are so many things you can do, and so much to learn about.

I absolutely hope what I said above becomes false at some point in the future, but I don't think it is yet, or at least not in such a way that *truly* differentiates the various other cryptos from BTC in a meaningful enough way as to make one a true peer, rather than an alt.

"I think number 2 could be a pretty big one. How many of those 100,000/day accounts that are signed up every day are linked to a primary email address that also links to a facebook profile with probably all the info you need to get into that account(that they will brag about gains on)? How often do regular people use 2FA? How many of these account can be cross referenced pretty easily against leaked password lists and password recovery questions and answers. Even if some of this data is hashed you always get someone who puts something that's easy to guess or writes 'password is ....' for the question that can then be cross referenced against other hashes. Big money wont be as stupid but people leak too much info without realizing it but it won't be good publicity.

I done this in work for fun one day with about 70GB of PW dumps from various sources and it's surprising how lax people are. We had an outsourced system that would send your password in plain text to your mobile number listed which any data entry member of staff could change to their own number and simply hit reset password(it's changed after I informed them that it's retarded and they had to undergo ISO cert). The responsibility of being your own bank is pretty big and so many PC's are riddled with viruses. Immutability cuts both ways(but I'm guessing most of the BTC being bought isn't leaving the exchange which isn't really a bad idea for people new to the scene) and the target is getting bigger and bigger though and people get complacent.

I've always used it as a store of value but it did freak me out when I realized how much I had gained and how much I would lose if we entered another bear market. It is proving itself though, these forks may cause some issues with the brand and eventually attract the wrong kind of attention though. It is a superior store of value in every way to gold but I think a lot of people are thinking 'risk free returns' at this point and that's when things can get a little hairy.

I think a lot of people have the mentality of bitcoin always bubbles(I know I do) just because the whole scene is pretty hard to understand, years of politics on the scaling debate, tech is different and challenges peoples view of what a store of wealth is. It's hard to value something that's the first of it's kind when almost everything around it in the space is so scammy(and the fact that the majority of the community could literally just fork off to another chain if any fuckery started to happen). Bubbles generally don't do most people any good because they left either bag holding or wishing they sold x amount higher and depending on how big it gets it could end with the general public who invested begging for regulation which just wont fly.

"The finality thing is arbitrary for visa, the transaction could be made irreversible if they felt like it, but right now people prefer lower fraud costs by allowing things like chargebacks or payment reversal. 

Maybe I’m missing something but ethereum is a large cryptocurrency (large than bitcoin a year ago) and can support higher transaction throughput. Is that not a real world enough case with 40 billion market cap and tons of transactions every second? 

If fraud increases with bitcoin with 0 confirmation transactions why would anyone want to use it? “Okay take the existing speedy system that works instantly and also has consumer facing features like chargebacks as well as visa bearing liability for fraud with fees of about .5%....what if we replaced that with a slower system that cost more money? Like fees of 10%?”

I remember bitcoin initially was going to open up a world of possibilities with micro transactions and quick low fee payments anywhere in the world. Now it seems to be rather slow and expensive and entirely useless for micro transactions. 

Point is if I want to buy a Nintendo switch or some other moderate but not even very high cost item I don’t want it to be tied up waiting in some store for 20 minutes and people right now steal baby food with fake coupons so people will defraud companies in a heartbeat if they embrace 0 confirmation. 

We will see. I’ve just heard a lot of talk and discussion about segwit and lightning and whatever but at the end of the day it costs way too much and takes way too long to send money compared to ethereum (or really any alt coin, but ethereum shows more real world use as right now it has over twice the volume of transactions and like 1/100 the cost). 

**The worry isn’t that bitcoin will be annoying to use now, the worry is that “visa coin” comes in and says “hey, we don’t suck. We got our shit together and we are fast and intuitive to use” and then VISA owns the crypto market because bitcoin is too slow to iterate. You can make the best foundation ever but if VISA comes in and steals the user base no one will care.**

Right now the appeal of bitcoin to the average American is getting rich. They don’t care whether it’s centralized or anonymous or not. If bitcoin falters and a mainstream company come soon out with a better coin, you’ll get the fast network with all of the strings attached and no one will want or care about bitcoin. It might even be banned.

in the crypto space we have a term for storage, either cold storage or hot storage. cold storage is much more secure than hot storage.

hot wallets include things like mobile wallets (apps like mycelium) desktop wallets (like bitcoin core).

cold wallets include hardware wallets that generate your nuclear launch codes in the most secure way possible. on a secure chip, independent of the desktop/laptop ecosystem. examples of this include ledger nano, trezor wallet, keepykey, opendime, and more.

A hash function is any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size to data of fixed size. The values returned by a hash function are called hash values, hash codes, digests, or simply hashes. One use is a data structure called a hash table, widely used in computer software for rapid data lookup. Hash functions accelerate table or database lookup by detecting duplicated records in a large file.

It's speculation in the sense that many people who buy or sell bitcoin don't really know what they're buying or selling. People who do their due dilligence buy and hold. They don't sell until the rest of the world catches up. Even then they won't sell for fiat, but use it to pay for stuff they want or need.

"So there are two types of fees. The first fee you will encounter is the exchange fee. Exchanges like coinbase.com will charge you for buying bitcoin. Such is life.

The other fee is the transaction fee. When you transfer bitcoin from one person to another, you need to pay a fee. This fee goes to the miners, and it's a defense mechanism against spam.

When miners mine a block, what they're doing is, they are grouping a bunch of transactions together and ""sealing"" them. They do this every 10 minutes, more or less. The amount of transactions per block is limited. So, the more transactions that being transmitted to the bitcoin network, the more competition there is to get your transaction into a block. Your transactions need to get into a block otherwise they are not recorded in the blockchain. If your transaction is not in a block (i.e. if it hasn't been confirmed), you can ""reverse"" it (though it's not really something easy to do for beginners). Once it's included in a block, it's almost impossible to change. After a few blocks, you would need some kind of fusion reactor or perhaps a dyson sphere to reverse your transaction.

The transaction fees are configurable. So, if you need your transaction to get confirmed quickly, then you must set a higher-than-average transaction fee. If you don't need it to be included in a block right away, like if you're sending money to a friend that trusts you won't revert the transaction, then you can set a lower fee.

If you just want to hodl and not spend bitcoin, then this doesn't matter much because you won't be making transactions. This is what I call ""investing"" I guess.

If you are going to be making transactions, then your wallet software can help you set the right fees (though they tend to usually over-estimate). Unfortunately, when you're using wallets on an exchange like coinbase, the fees are not customizable and they are way too high. So expect your first few transactions to realistically cost you $10 to $20 in fees. 

I honestly just keep my coins in a hardware wallet and chill. If I were to buy something with bitcoin, I would immediately replenish my stash by buying more, so I wouldn't lose any gains.

Even though bitcoin has been around for almost 10 years, there is still much to be done. There was a big release on August 1st that will eventually allow us make transactions cheaper and faster, while still retaining the same properties of bitcoin. This is called the Lightning Network and it's being tested right now. And yes Bitcoin was just the first cryptocurrency. There are TONS of them out there now. Also there are a lot of scams, and lots of misinformation, so be careful. Be especially cautious of the ones that claim to be bitcoin. The ones on coinbase are legit. There's Ethereum which is like a big, planetary-scale virtual computer. Then there's Litecoin which is what I would use to make transactions. It is very similar to bitcoin. There's Monero for anonymous transactions. And more!";1;0;False;0xHUEHUE;dqcrvfy;It's over 9000!!!;7fkqh5;https://i.imgur.com/jyoZGyW.gifv

"The reason bitcoin is slower and more expensive than traditional payment systems is because it is decentralized. It's not run by some specific company on dedicated high performance hardware in a data center. It's a peer to peer network without a central authority. This makes things very resilient but also orders of magnitute more complex if you want to get it right. Which we do.

This will never change. Distributed systems are always less efficient than their centralized counterparts. It will always be easier and more efficient to run something like Paypal on corporately owned, walled of, dedicated servers. 

However, bitcoin will close most of that efficiency gap through better technology while maintaining all properties that make bitcoin special.

mining is a competition to see who can come up with the correct [hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function) (string of numbers) first. 

hashing as fast as possible gives you the best chance at winning the game. Each time someone wins the game, they are rewarded with 12.5 bitcoins. The game then resets. The difficulty of the game automatically adjusts so that people win/the game resets every 10 minutes.

so every 10 minutes 12.5 new bitcoin are created (currently). ";2;1;False;Fiach_Dubh;dqd086b;It's over 9000!!!;7fkqh5;https://i.imgur.com/jyoZGyW.gifv
"I completely agree that the banks fucked up, and many governments (especially the U.S one) heavily fucked up because they refused to regulate their banks properly. 

I'm in Australia and we were actually very fortunate at the time of the GFC because we had a progressive government in office at the time that was able to react quickly and implement policy to soften the blow from the recession.

The problem I have with bitcoin is everyone is always talking about the supply side of things (you know the lines about how ""governments can print as much money as they want"" and other bullshit like that) but I really don't see people talking about the impact that demand has on the price of bitcoin at the moment. The amount of speculation happening at the moment is absolutely insane and I think it's a fair assumption to make that many people are buying in without thoroughly researching bitcoin (or the basics of financial investment for that matter).  

I've even noticed people in my facebook contacts promoting bitcoin and encouraging people to buy them. The price can't keep going up forever and when it begins to plateau people are going to start selling because the majority of bitcoin holders don't give a fuck about using bitcoin as a currency, they have bought bitcoin because they want to profit from the decision. And the only way for people to realise that profit is to sell the bitcoins that they currently hold. 

So keeping all that in mind, I honestly feel that at some time in the future that it is very possible that bitcoin will become a toxic asset. Bitcoin (and cryptocurrencies in general) have an incredible amount of potential, but if a major crash does happen then there's a good chance that it'll shake everyone's confidence and seriously hinder bitcoin's ability to experience growth on the scale that it is currently occurring.

I absolutely agree with you though, Things like IOTA, ETH, LTC, XRP, *whatever* fulfill *far* more purposes than BTC alone could ever hope to, and between all the alts they fulfill every purpose BTC has or could have *better than BTC does*.

While it probably doesn't bode well for the market in the short-term (a couple years from now at most, I imagine) that BTC might fail as the others put more and more pressure on it, I don't think it's capable of evolving quick enough to maintain its dominance indefinitely. As you said, it needs to be agile and utilize newer tech as it becomes available/viable, but it isn't, and won't.

">5 satoshi a byte is very low. 

Sure, I never claimed otherwise. As my link showed these were the lowest fee txs that were being included in blocks. This constantly changes as the mempool grows/decreases.

>Even 60 minutes is extremely slow. Hell even 10 minutes is rather slow for day to day use.

That is an opinion, I don't think 60 minutes and especially not 10 is extremely slow for trustless settlement finality. In fact, this is incredibly fast compared to VISA and PayPal - which can be several months.

>I can’t imagine waiting that long when buying stuff but if they don’t wait for the confirmation they are opening themselves up to fraud.

I disagree, small retail payments make sense to be 0-conf (with a small fee-premium), running out and double spending your frappuccino to your own address should legally be no different than shoplifting. I think you vastly overestimate the amount of people that will do this. Now of course, with online services this is a different story and more business dependent.

>I’m not concern trolling for other coins, I’m saying bitcoin should address this because it’s a problem.

Right, scaling blockchains without compromising the core attributes is definitely a challenge. There are a lot of people hard at work at solving this on Bitcoin - a lot of exciting potential solutions are being tested as we speak after years of development.

>Problem is no one wants to change anything, so we are using 2009 era technology in 2017 basically.
False, we JUST got SegWit after years of stalemate. This is neither an instant fix nor a permanent one, but it is incredibly important to the feasibility of exponential (off-chain) scaling.

>Altcoins took what bitcoin is and generally made desired tweaks (most of them were to just make money in pump and dump but still). No reason bitcoin can’t adopt some of those tweaks.

Sorry for being blunt but this reek of arrogance. We've seen waves of new people come into the community and say, ""why don't we just do X, it's so simple and better"", but the actual experts in the field that care about the viability of the system long term more than cheap transactions today are almost unanimously and for very good reason, not recommending these hastily rolling out these ""EZ tweaks"".

We're witnessing the construction of ""the internet of money"", the foundation is extremely important to get as solid as possible, even if this means compromizing with one of the usecases (smaller value transfers) for a few early adopters in a certain period.

"> You all just naming wallets. Which ones are full nodes?

Good point, I've edited the post. The ones I listed were mobile wallets which are either ""SPV wallets"" (a light mode node, that trusts the chain with the most hashpower and does not not fully validate the blockchain) or relies on a 3rd party server.

If you want to have a full node, you'll need a computer for that. I recommend running [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org), which is basically the backbone of the Bitcoin network right now, it has an very good track record.  
Many mobile wallets (e.g bread) let's you hook up a remote full node. I recommend doing this if you are tech savvy.  
There's nothing wrong with storing your Bitcoins directly on Bitcoin Core though.

> How do I not run a full node? 

The wallet will most likely tell you that it's a full node. You do not need to worry about this.

> Whats a hot wallet vs cold?

A hot wallet means a device that is connected to the Internet (like your mobile phone etc). This can be dangerous if you have many Bitcoins, you usually don't want to store lots of Bitcoin on a  internet connected device.  
A cold wallet is offline, usually on a piece of paper or on something called a ""hardware wallet"" (which is a secure device storing the Bitcoins).";1;0;False;SatoshisCat;dqcvef5;It's over 9000!!!;7fkqh5;https://i.imgur.com/jyoZGyW.gifv

"Are card payments less relevant to you if you don't own a visa server? Is gold irrelevant if you can transfer your dollars into it, but can't mine it profitably from home? Mining maintains the ledger, thus allows the network to continue running. For now miners are incentivized with new bitcoin for their work, although eventually this will switch to just earning transaction fees; the difficulty of doing this adjusts to account for the number of people mining. Bitcoin is cryptographically secure, and other than earning money for processing transactions via donated computing power, it doesn't give up any control of the network to miners; there's such a thing as a 51% attack, where certain manipulations can happen if one individual controlled over half of all mining power, but the amount of money required to do so deincentivizes anyone from aiming for this as a loss of confidence in the network due to such an event would vastly decrease their investment's value.

The advantage of bitcoin is it's a completely decentralised, electronic value. You have control over all your money and no bank going bust, country ceasing to exist etc. can take that from you.

"**Civil forfeiture in the United States**

Civil forfeiture in the United States, also called civil asset forfeiture or civil judicial forfeiture or occasionally civil seizure, is a controversial legal process in which law enforcement officers take assets from persons suspected of involvement with crime or illegal activity without necessarily charging the owners with wrongdoing. While civil procedure, as opposed to criminal procedure, generally involves a dispute between two private citizens, civil forfeiture involves a dispute between law enforcement and property such as a pile of cash or a house or a boat, such that the thing is suspected of being involved in a crime. To get back the seized property, owners must prove it was not involved in criminal activity. Sometimes it can mean a threat to seize property as well as the act of seizure itself.

***

**Executive Order 6102**

Executive Order 6102 is a United States presidential executive order signed on April 5, 1933, by President Franklin D. Roosevelt ""forbidding the Hoarding of gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates within the continental United States"". The effect of the order, in conjunction with the statute under which it was issued, was to criminalize the possession of monetary gold by any individual, partnership, association or corporation.

"Again, **most** people do not consider the risk of civil forfeiture to be high enough to bother with managing their own cash (or tomorrow, crypto). Bitcoin makes it *easier and safer* to manage your own cash in many ways, but there is still substantial risk and you really need to know what you're doing. For this reason, I believe most people will not hold their life savings behind a private key in their possession, just like most people do not keep their fiat savings in cash.

Bitcoin was invented to avoid government *control* of money. Asset forfeiture is only a small piece of this control, and many benefits of Bitcoin are not undermined by keeping your coins in a custodial account.";0;1;False;farsightxr20;dqcsf2p;It's over 9000!!!;7fkqh5;https://i.imgur.com/jyoZGyW.gifv

Probably your first time looking into Bitcoin? Look into it deeper than reddit dude. Yes, the price is taking off - so did Apple & Facebook shares, yet people still buy into these companies today for financial security and profits. Also being developed are solutions to remove most of the traffic from the main blockchain and have transactions completed on a ‘second layer’.  This’ll speed transaction times, lower fees and make running a node (supporting decentralisation) easier for the average punter. Divisiblity has nothing to do with scaling. The majority of “the wealthy” are not even aware of Bitcoin yet. The majority of holders are Gen X & Y tech heads, former darknet users, cypher punks and open minded early adopters.

"As long as you don't have more than 50% of miners colluding, everything is good. They also invested a lot of money to build their mining farms, so they have an incentive to keep the network healthy to keep making money. Bitcoin is designed to become harder and harder to mine over time. It adjusts the mining difficulty such that blocks are found roughly every 10 minutes.

If a hostile government or mining corporation tries to take over, we have a defense mechanism: nodes. Everybody can run a node to make sure the miners are following the rules. There are MANY nodes running out there, all over the planet. Miners are incentivized to follow the rules, because if the nodes don't accept what they mine, then they don't get rewarded, which means they can't pay for their electricity. This is part of the decentralization aspect of bitcoin.

And then we have the nuclear option. We can make all the mining farms obsolete by changing the mining algorithm (i.e. the Proof of Work algorithm).

The hashpower is ultimately what gives bitcoin its security and value. Nobody can tamper with the ledger because it takes too much computing power to do so. If you had that much computing power, you would use it to mine bitcoin.

You do not need to mine bitcoin to use as an investment or as a day-to-day currency. You can just straight up buy it. You don't need to buy one whole bitcoin.

The web-based miners are for mining other types of currencies like Monero. You cannot mine bitcoin in this way.

"GDAX is a cryptocurrency exchange that resembles something wall street uses. Buy and sell orders, pretty charts, etc. It requires that you verify your identity, but you gain access to cheap transactions. 0.25% for a market price order, free if you set up an order (I believe, it's explained in detail on their site).  Coinbase (who owns GDAX) charges 4% for credit card purchases, and you have to pay miners' fees to move the coins out. Most exchanges do something along those lines.

Now it does take a few days for a bank transfer to clear and funds to arrive at GDAX. Once you click ""buy"" they are yours instantly. Moving coins out of the exchange to a wallet will take the same amount of time that any bitcoin transaction takes - lately it's been between 15 minutes and a couple hours.

Transferring coins from the exchange to a wallet you own and control is free with GDAX. This is not typical of exchanges because all bitcoin transactions have a miners' fee.  Confirming a single bitcoin transaction uses more electricity than the average American home uses in a week. Ugly truth right there. 

It's recommended that you only leave your coins in an exchange if you have a negligible amount or if you are actively trading them. Otherwise, a desktop wallet, phone wallet (I personally don't trust my phone's security), hardware wallet, or paper wallet is the ideal parking spot for your stack.

"Internally the company could have had a large number of wallets with coins moved automatically by software between them. For example when a client wanted to send bitcoin in they would have to be given an address to send it to. Thus would then likely be moved to a central holding wallet. Then more wallets for handling exchanges and withdrawals etc.

It's more than possible a bug could have moved coins about in ways they struggled to trace. This means they might still control the money but have no idea which accounts it's in or if they used disposable wallets the money may be In accounts they deleted the private keys for.

Alternatively someone could have found a place in the system where they could skim off bitcoin without it being immediately noticeable. Eventually someone realised there was far less in there than there should be and looked into it.

> New evidence presented in April 2015 by Tokyo security company WizSec led them to conclude that ""most or all of the missing bitcoins were stolen straight out of the Mt. Gox hot wallet over time, beginning in late 2011.

So taken from the main exchange wallet. There would be thousands of transactions from this every day so unless you had actice monitoring systems it could easily be missed. ";2;1;False;cbzoiav;dqcqv04;It's over 9000!!!;7fkqh5;https://i.imgur.com/jyoZGyW.gifv

"Thank you for being civil.

My comment, that started so much vitriol was as follows:

""Please consider diversifying your investments.""

Bubbles follow the pattern you've described.  In fact, if you look up bubble, this comes up rather early, and predates Bitcoin:

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Stages_of_a_bubble.png

Take a look at r/bitcoin.  The level of unanalytical enthusiasm positively *reeks* of both the '08 housing bubble and '01 dot.com bubble.  Those were years in the making as well.

The people writing of jumping on the train, or the rocket, or getting rich, aren't talking of actual value added or analyzing potentials risks to the investment.

On that front, I'm very leery.  Anyone looking at a cryptocurrency and thinking it's a no-brainer investment is - in my opinion - dangerously underestimating risk.  That's why I encourage people to diversify their risk by not putting everything in bitcoin.

That advice, here, appears to be heretical - a word that is very fitting, given the prevailing mindset.

Don't put all your eggs in one basket.  Bitcoin is not a sure thing.  There are no sure things.

PersonallyI'm not convinced that what people called hyperbitcoinization is really plausible for a few reasons (whether a sole deflationary currency will work being one of them). I see it as more of an antidote to bad monetary policy. People see inflation as bad, which I understand with the current state of things, but it does serve a purpose. No one wants to spend a deflationary currency (hence all the hodl memes and the if you buy that now it will cost you 100K in the future talk) so I can see the argument that inflation stimulates spending and investment in other things which i turn creates a better quality of life(in theory). I still think long term it's way undervalued but it still has to actually scale for anything  because interest and price are going parabolic but network throughput (or even usage) isn't which leads to the conclusion that most of what we see now is total speculation which renders the store of wealth use case shaky at best because a bitcoin bear market is brutal. Historically we always recover but we will get that one bubble that really overshoots it and I think we may be going into it soon before the network is quite ready...

It's an investment vehicle, and one that only has value for current holders, and only if new people keep buying in so that current holders can sell out. Once people see that the only way to get value out of bitcoin is to sell it... well, then a lot of people lose a lot of money.;4;1;False;;dqcvmur;It's over 9000!!!;7fkqh5;https://i.imgur.com/jyoZGyW.gifv
"> that means you're subject to censorship by VISA, in case they don't like what you buy or who you buy it from.

While technically true, these kind of arguments usually just alienate people from Bitcoin. The parent was asking a practical question, and got a hypothetical reply about something they are not at all concerned about (VISA censoring their purchase of a perfectly legal and unregulated product). It does make it sound like it's just for nefarious purchases.

Better way to think about it - Bitcoin is digital cash. With some of the same upsides (can sort of be sent anonymously), though in some circumstances that doesn't really matter (you're giving the store your name and address anyway, and the store is required to comply with all KYC type laws). It also has the downsides of using cash instead of something like a credit card or paypal - once you send it it's gone and there's no way to ""charge back"" the money if something goes wrong. For some of the same reasons I'd prefer not to send a western union money transfer to buy stuff online, I don't really see much point in using bitcoin for online shopping. (Though maybe one day a cryptocurrency or side chain will provide a compelling reason to do this).

The bigger value of bitcoin is as an alternative to gold and money transmitters. It's a fixed resource, with prices controlled by the market instead of any government. I can choose to own and control it myself (put it under my mattress, so to speak, but more securely) or invest in it but have someone else control the actual resource. And it can be sent around the world without interference from governments or middlemen (which does have a concrete benefit for people in countries with less dependable currencies), for a small flat fee regardless of whether I need to send cents or thousands of dollars.

> How do I convert Bitcoin into things I want?

It (or one of the many many other electronic forms of payment)might someday turn into a stable currency(I don't think so but I might be wrong of course) but these days it's starting to look a lot like an electronic Ponzi-scheme to me.

"**Eternal September**

Eternal September or the September that never ended is Usenet slang for a period beginning in September 1993, the month that Internet service provider America Online began offering Usenet access to its many users, overwhelming the existing culture for online forums. The influx in Usenet users was also indirectly caused by the aggressive direct mailing campaign by AOL Chief Marketing Officer Jan Brandt in order to beat out CompuServe and Prodigy, which most notably involved distributing millions of floppy disks and CD-ROMs with free trials of AOL.

Before then, Usenet was largely restricted to colleges and universities. Every September, a large number of incoming freshmen would acquire access to Usenet for the first time, taking time to become accustomed to Usenet's standards of conduct and ""netiquette"". After a month or so, these new users would either learn to comply with the networks' social norms or tire of using the service.

"I'll ask this, what other cryptocurrency is becoming a household name? Sure you can rattle off 100 or more alt coins,  but this discussion wasn't about alts,  just BTC. I have a few coins in different alts.  I don't regularly  buy them anymore but I track their prices and record them from day to day in my spreadsheets. 

Sure another crypto could take the lead.  But for now there is BTC leading the pack.  How many places are accepting etherium or litecoin, or dash,  or ripple, or whatever coin you want to talk about?  Not many.  Meanwhile BTC is actively becoming a standard in places like Venezuela, for a variety of reasons, such as: their government's currency is in hyperinflation, and is unstable, and electricity is free or cheap there. BTC is now easy to mine there,  and a good alternative people are actively using every day. 

You could say that crypto is a waste of electricity, but with so many options for renewable energy, it's hard to argue is harmful to the environment. 

How harmful to the environment is actual currency?  Copper pennies?  Well you have to mine copper. Transfer the ore,  smelt the ore,  press it into usable sheets,  stamp out each coin,   distribute  the new coins. Moving tons of copper around can't be cheap or easy,  so every step of the way you're using oil or electricity to move tons of metal. How does a single penny compare in cost to the environment to a single BTC? And that's just pennies.  More metal,  nickel,  zinc,  silver,  etc,  all smelted and processed to make various coins. Paper money takes harvesting crops for the fibers, washing them with special chemicals, inks and even metals embedded into some of them,  special printing processes, man hours. Certainly sounds like even printing money is hard on the environment.

So your argument that cryptocurrency is harmful to the environment is laughable at best.  With solar, wind,  hydro or even nuclear, crypto would have the smallest footprint of all currency.";2;1;False;johnnyringo771;dqde5tn;It's over 9000!!!;7fkqh5;https://i.imgur.com/jyoZGyW.gifv

"Absolutely. The first 2 sentences are basically nonsense. It's an argument that basically just insists upon itself; ""I'm awesome because I say that I'm awesome, and that means I'm awesome.""

Second paragraph says that Bitcoin is going to go up in price because it has gone up in price... so logically it will go up in price. The first thing ANYONE learns about investment is that past results do not indicate future performance. 

Claiming that it is like email in the 90's, is a false analogy. Email in the 90's has obviously become wildly successful. Bitcoin has not. If anything, they're just pointing out that governments have tried to ban it as a ""currency"", which is not a positive.

The thing that really pissed me off, however, is that they referred to it as a deflationary currency, as if that is a positive thing. The fact that it's deflationary is what makes it so terrible as a currency. By definition, currency needs to be spent. A dollar isn't a dollar if no one will spend it. People spend dollars because they're inflationary, meaning they'll be worth more tomorrow than they are today. 

No one buys Bitcoin so they can more easily purchase things; they buy Bitcoin because they think it will go up in price. But THAT, is an investment... not a currency.

As a currency, It has problems. However I would argue that Bitcoin has turned into a legitimate store of value (like digital gold) for people to park their money. People who are looking for an exit to the current monetary system. The main advantages over gold being its decentralised and uncontrollable by nature, censorship resistant, publicly verifiable (as apposed to buying gold- which you just get a certificate of ownership).

No one knows. Random is as random does. Just like stocks it's up, down or sideways at every support or resistance.

The current landscape.

We just broke above a 12 month old established channel on the logarithmic chart. 

Before this happened many were looking for a dip to add positions (wanting a dip and getting one can be mutually exclusive if everyone wants the same thing). 7700, 7200, 6700, 6200 and spots between were all mentioned as potential targets for a step backwards before the push for 10k.

Now the channel has broken no one knows what anything is. 

Personally I took the bet that top of channel around 8800 has turned from resistance to support. That anything approaching 8k will be seen as cheap, especially with so much attention from the recent milestones and strong fundamentals. While anything below 8k will be snapped up.

Its a financial tool. Imagine being in a country like Venezuela their currency plummets so you buy things of that will hold their value like jewelry for example. Things get worse and you try to escape the country but get stopped by corrupt government officals and shaken down for what you have with you. With bitcoin you can put it in a wallet, memorize a 12 word seed phrase in your head, leave the country and safely recover your finances on a new phone or computer. What you see is the first world use of a country that has centralized banks and a currency that is somewhat stable. There are tons of ways to use bitcoin. ;3;0;False;lunaislife;dqcpmxd;It's over 9000!!!;7fkqh5;https://i.imgur.com/jyoZGyW.gifv
"I did like you're doing now, back when bitcoin was a dollar. 

I could have been a mega mega mega dollar multimillionaire. But I was very close-minded then, and I basically talked myself out of buying any bitcoin. With the spare money I had, I could have bought, 8 or 9 THOUSAND bitcoins. Sigh.

But I believed in liberal Statism. Meaning, money comes from governments, has the backing of their economy, hand-waved the intrinsic value problem or not (I was never hung up on intrinsic value ideas). 

You obviously don't have to buy into this or *anything* you don't like. But a lot of bitcoiners are pretty passionate about the politics past the ""coin"".

Anyway, maybe there will be other awesome opportunities in life out there for you, just maybe keep your eyes peeled for good things.

Technically correct - the best kind of correct? :P

The reason I added that was to make clear that using Bitcoin through a VISA card isn't the same as using Bitcoin directly. Perhaps there's better ways to explain that distinction, but I felt I needed to include the difference, somehow, without going into a long discussion about the details (like you are doing now, btw).

"Bitcoin is not anonymous. Bitcoin is publicly tracked. You can see person id exchanging bitcoin for EVERY transaction.

So your online identity is immediately betrayed when you use bitcoin. Bam, right there. Literally having your id and amount transferred for EVERY transaction, 100% publicly available for anyone to look up. That is the opposite of anonymous. 

And the transaction doesn't go away. Once you have a user id to focus in on, you can see ALL transactions for that user id since bitcoin started. Not anonymous. 

Then you say well your physical identity is not known. Okay, unless you try to use your money for real things. And let's be honest, that's the point of money. To buy things like food housing and shelter. That's the point of money right? To have things in real life? 

Once you buy something real or convert something to cash, your online identity and your physical identity are betrayed because you must either physically go convert the coin to cash or you have to give someone an address to send it to.

Right. I'm sure the hundreds of developers that have committed themselves to the Bitcoin project are going to suddenly all quit at the same time today.

That's literally what would need to happen for your speculation to be true. When discussing markets yes past performance does not guarantee future performance. But don't engage in a false dichotomy where are you ignore all of the context to take your perspective.

"/u/kars4kidz already said this, but I don't think he really did justice to *just how incredibly significant* BTC's first-mover advantage is. It's the original, the basis from which all the others were designed, and it has *always* been the basis by which others are judged, and by the time exchanges came along, that role carried over to make it the currency pair for every single new currency that has been created (more often than fiat currency even, and by a large margin at that).

It's the first, the most well known, and the one with the greatest trust and assurance that it will maintain and continue to grow value. Add to that the fact that if literally anyone wants to get into any cryptocurrency *besides* BTC, the most direct possible rout to do so is usually *through* BTC, so even if you don't want to own BTC in particular you still have to contribute some amount of volume to its trading, and when thousands upon thousands of people do that on a regular basis it has a visible effect on the value of the currency, and that's just as a 'middle man' [of sorts, anyway].

No, I don't believe BTC is the 'best' currency out there, for nearly any role to be completely frank, but I *do* think it is and will continue to be the most valuable and heavily used cryptocurrency for a long time to come.

All this being my own opinion, of course, so take it with a grain of salt. Sorry for the ramble, and have a nice day!";7;1;False;Mausoleum-Monger;dqcnhnz;It's over 9000!!!;7fkqh5;https://i.imgur.com/jyoZGyW.gifv
"Its about how secure a currency is, or how secure a blockchain is. If a hedge fund manager wants to invest $100 million in a crypto, the first thing he will want to make sure is that his money can't be stolen. Bitcoin is secured by its ever increasing [hash rate](https://blockchain.info/charts/hash-rate). To steal even one bitcoin, any government or attacker will have to spend billions of dollars. Other smaller cryptocurrencies can be faked with lower barriers.  

Bitcoin is the most secure, because it is the biggest, by a huge margin. That is one factor that makes it preferable to other coins when you want to save money using some crypto.

WOW. to think we will most likely be at $10000 before next year. b4 December even. Maybe even today. What was the price this time last year? $720-$735 or so. We are up (what is that in percentage???) 500%? (roughly) is that right? 2018 is going to be very interesting. i think we see some INSANE values next year for many coins. im looking at you Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bcash, and Monero too.

"Bitcoin is something I don't fully understand. From the perspective of someone who tries to look out for scams and schemes, it seems like Bitcoin is a combination of a scam and pyramid scheme, then disguised as a stock option that's not really a stock option. Here is a list of red flags that are set off (at least for me) about Bitcoin:  

1. The Product is vague- It helps you get rid of mortgage and student loans, is one phrase you'll hear on a lot of PS. Bitcoin has similar language. Decentralized Currency (while tangible) makes it sound very similar to Passive Income. My SO asked what Bitcoin was, I had almost as hard a time explaining scientology as I did Bitcoin. When the product you're selling is hard to break it down into five year old language, it brings up a red flag.  

2. It isn't tangible. The Product is all electronic, except for the money I use when buying it. Why should I use paper money to buy suspicious online money? My default answer would be that I shouldn't.  

3. It's too hackable. I'm concerned with online banking and passwords. I go through all the steps to protect my identity but sometimes it's stolen (according to my bank). With Bitcoin being entirely online, what am I supposed to do if a volatile group from the internet organised a mass hacking of Bitcoin? What if I say something on Reddit to someone and they get loaded and steal all of my Bitcoin? I can fight someone who's trying to mug me irl and my bank informs me when something happens online.  

4. The buying of a wallet and the fees of using my money. It sounds like an everyday thing, a wallet...but in Bitcoin you have to make sure to get a secure wallet. I use a metal wallet to hold all my cards and cash, how much more secure can you get irl? The fact that I not only have to spend money to hold Bitcoin (shouldn't there be a universal wallet that targets hackers of other people's wallets?) and the fact that I'm charged money each time I want to use my money (in aware this is the case irl, but Bitcoin is supposed to be better than real money, right?) I just don't want to deal with knowingly spending more than what the price is. Where is that money going anyways?  

5. Over 9,000. Well that's very good! Bit now that means I have to pay 9,000 of my money to buy one Bitcoin? What if I transfer my money into a lesser currency? Will it still be over 9,000 ruples?  

6. The language is vague and silver lined. Nodes, Universal, Mining. It's an unfamiliar language that seems to me (as someone who avoids schemes) that the language is used to penetrate people's defenses by using buzz words.  

TL;DR: I'm excited for you guys! I'm also skeptical of Bitcoin.";-2;9;False;backalleybrawler;dqd0x8a;It's over 9000!!!;7fkqh5;https://i.imgur.com/jyoZGyW.gifv

Why Bitcoin is important / valuable: For the first time in human history, you can be your own bank. It is a censorship resistant, decentralized, global, system of trust. That has tremendous value any will change the world in so many ways we can’t even imagine. If you factor in the potential (similar to the discounted cash flow of a stock), it’s price is way undervalued in my opinion.

"To any newbies thinking about getting in.

1. Don't panic buy. There are more gains in the future and it will take time.
2. Get an account on coinbase or look into localbitcoins. Coinbase is like the simplest and user friendlyist method possible.
3. Buy a small amount. like $20 or something and then WAIT. The worst thing you can do is buy a lot of bitcoin all at once.
4. In the meantime familiarize yourself with bitcoin using bitcoin**.org**
5. Be especially wary of scammers! ""Bitcoin Cash"", ""Bitcoin Gold"", Bitconnect, etc are **not** bitcoin. They are literal scams.
6. The links in the sidebar are good.
7. Learn about Dollar Cost Averaging / Automatic Investing and do that after you are comfortable with your $20.
8. Realize that you, yes you, value losses far greater than gains. If you have $100 to your name and you gain $50 you value this less than losing $50. If you are not aware of this, and you only buy bitcoin because of a fear of missing out then you will inevitably sell at a loss ensuring you lose money. Better to instead get your cash and lite it on fire. At least you get to look at a pretty flame.";53;4;False;kaiser13;dqcnnmr;It's over 9000!!!;7fkqh5;https://i.imgur.com/jyoZGyW.gifv

Bitcoin’s value derives from its current real uses (mainly for money transfers and remittances) its limited supply and scarcity (store of value) and its many potential uses. Also, behind the curtains there is a huge growth in the bitcoin ecosystem development that a regular folk can't see because it's ignored by the media.
If you buy for day trading you may lose money, but if you hold long term, it has been proven you get nice ROI. And bitcoin has barely started, think of the Internet/email in the 90's. A decentralized technology that has a valuable use it's not going to disappear, even if a few tyrannical governments try to ""ban"" it.
Check out this great articles:
What Gave Bitcoin Its Value?

""How do Bitcoins have value?""
https://www.quora.com/How-do-Bitcoins-have-value/answer/David-Strayhorn
Bitcoin is a worldwide-distributed decentralized peer-to-peer censorship-resistant trustless and permissionless deflationary system/currency (see Blockchain technology) backed by mathematics, open source code, cryptography and the most powerful and secure decentralized computational network on the planet, orders of magnitude more powerful than Google and government combined. There is a limit of 21 million bitcoins (divisible into smaller units). ""Backed by Government"" money is not backed by anything and is infinitely printed at will by Central Banks. Bitcoin is limited and decentralized.
Receive and transfer money, from cents (micropayments) to thousands:
Very cheap regardless of amount $$$ sent (with new apps coming)
Borderless (no country can stop it from going in/out or confiscate)
Trustless (nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work)
Privacy (no need to expose personal information)
Securely (encrypted cryptographically and can’t be confiscated)
Permissionless (no approval from central powers needed)
Instantly (from seconds to a few minutes)
Open source (auditable by anybody)
Worldwide distributed (from anywhere to anywhere on the planet)
Censorship resistant (no government can stop its use)
Peer-to-peer (no intermediaries with a cut)
Portable (easier to carry/move than cash, gold and silver)
Public ledger (transparent, seen by everybody)
Scalable (each bitcoin is divisible down to 8 decimals)
Decentralized (distributed with no single point of failure)
Deflationary (its supply goes down with time until reaching 21 million ever)
Immutable global registry (can’t be altered/hacked by nobody)
No chargebacks-No fraud ('push' vs' 'pull' transactions).﻿
And that’s just as currency, Bitcoin has many more uses and applications.

Yes you are right. The rising price is primarily of significance to speculators. It does not make it more usable as a currency in the short term. In the long term a large valuation makes it better, because it means there is more capital (and therefore liquidity) in the asset. But short-term volatility is incredibly high and Bitcoin isn't quite ready to scale to mass adoption at this moment.

I too grew up with poor family who knew only how to remain poor. No instilling of a culture of saving and growth.

For 20 years I considered the stock market only to be a scam and only to be for gambling.

I was to remain poor (no matter how high paying my work) until I started investing.

"It's all fairly simple once broken down. To buy bitcoin you need to use one of the exchanges that offers them for USD (or whatever currency you may use). I personally like [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com) because it's easy to use , but [Gemini](https://gemini.com/) and [GDAX](https://www.gdax.com/) are also good exchanges, and there are a few others.

Simply make an account, and click buy.

After they process your transaction, your BTC will be stored on a wallet on the exchange. It's generally a terrible idea to keep your money on an exchange though, so you'll want to take it off there whenever possible. To do this you'll need to make a wallet. There's a lot of information about this available, but [here was a pretty good write up about wallets](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/7fjwda/usb_memory_sticks_ok_to_store_bitcoin/dqce2nn/) recently in /r/bitcoinbegginers

"Posting in a legendary thread.

Bitcoin is going to change the world. Yes, the price is rising, but it isn't about that. It's decentralised banking - bank accounts and payments between them without a bank. Like Uber to taxi companies, or AirBnB to hotels. Mathematically verified, with no trust in any third-party, or any permission required. It is impossible for anyone to freeze your holdings if they don't have your private keys. It is banking for the billions of unbanked people in the world. Please read about the technology; it is so much more than just an asset to be traded and profited from.

Dont kick yourself... I held for 6 years, bought throughout the bear markets and thought next time this looks like it's bubbling I'll trade it because losing 80-90% of your net wealth(even if the majority of it was gains) is not funny. Made a serious mistake there and lost 300K that's now worth over about 1m with all the forks. I bought the majority of my coins at $1.50 and cost averaged up through multiple bubbles and bear markets and now have next to no coins after a big fuckup(involving an sticky keyboard and an extra 0) and a series of bad trades (on top of never trading with that amount before so totally unfamiliar with the emotions of trading large amounts) on the futures markets. I would have made about 900K this year alone. The only time I took profit was when it went to $3 and cashed out my initial investment. I always knew it would reach this price someday but the speed at which it has is surprising even after watching 5-6 bubbles, life goes on...;3;0;False;-mjneat;dqcqmgb;It's over 9000!!!;7fkqh5;https://i.imgur.com/jyoZGyW.gifv

"Let's take each one of your points.

1) So I don't know who has been saying ""it'll help you get rid of mortgage and student loans"", but you should stop listening to them. They sound like ""get rich quick"" conmen. That is NOT what bitcoin was designed to do. The whole point is for it to be inflation-resistant money not controlled by a central government and that is easy to move around the world.

2) This isn't really different than the money you have in your bank account right? That's ALSO just 1s an 0s somewhere.

3) This is actually a valid concern, and what I consider one of the largest barriers to mass adoption. If you don't think you can trust yourself to stop yourself from getting hacked, it's probably a bad idea to get into bitcoin. Because you'll have no one to turn to if you accidentally give someone else all your money. There is no way to roll back those transactions.

That being said, if you're worried about ""a mass hacking of bitcoin"", you probably don't need to worry about that. It's one of the best parts of bitcoin - there isn't really a way to hack the protocol itself. You can hack USERS of bitcoin, but not bitcoin. And the fact that that hasn't happened despite the HUGE incentive to do so proves its resiliency.

4. Wait, what? Who says you have to BUY a wallet? Just download one onto a secure PC that you have (and don't get hacked).

5. If it's the big scary number that bothers you, remember that you don't have to buy a whole bitcoin. A millibit (1/1000th of a bitcoin, and a perfectly usable unit) is right now only $9.10 . You don't have to own a WHOLE bitcoin. You can just own fractions of them.

As far as your ruples question, I googled ""ruple"" and google autocorrected to rupee. So 1 bitcoin would be about 580,953 rupees right now.

6. Those aren't buzzwords - they're actual terms. And they're very important. You should be able to google to figure out what they mean in the context of bitcoin, or just ask somewhere.

Hopefully that helps!";3;1;False;ensignlee;dqd45er;It's over 9000!!!;7fkqh5;https://i.imgur.com/jyoZGyW.gifv
">Decentralized Currency (while tangible) makes it sound very similar to Passive Income

What about decentralized currency makes it sound similar to passive income? Holding bitcoin is like holding gold. There's no passive income involved.

>My SO asked what Bitcoin was, I had almost as hard a time explaining scientology as I did Bitcoin. 

What level of explanation are you looking for? There are explanations ranging from simply what you can do with it, all the way to exactly how everything works under the hood. I would recommend watching this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4&t=114s

>It isn't tangible

Do you mean you can't touch it? I've heard this argument a lot. Some governments are pushing towards a cashless society, at which point the money in your bank would no longer be tangible. Is that not okay with you? OR do you mean it isn't ""real."" If that's the case I would disagree. It's definitely tangible.

>It's too hackable

There have been incidents where bitcoin was stolen. These were not caused by issues with the underlying network. This is a new technology though, and I can understand your fears. What I think could maybe put you at ease, would be learning more about how Bitcoin, and blockchains in general, work. I think once you did, it would be more clear as to what you could do to not have your bitcoin taken away. I personally hope that in the future there are more options where users do not have to take on the responsibilities their bank would, but at the moment, most people will recommend you do. You will hear people say not to keep your bitcoin in an exchange, or any other centralized service for storing them. That's probably sound advice for now, but you do need to have a decent understanding of the technology.

>The buying of a wallet and the fees of using my money

Hardware wallets cost money, but there are plenty of free, reputable software wallets that will do the job for you if you just want to try it out. Solutions to fees, as well as the underlying issue of scalability, are currently being worked on. The general idea is to move small transactions ""off-chain."" You can currently send millions of dollars for 20 cents though. That's not bad.

>I have to pay 9,000 of my money to buy one Bitcoin? 

If you want 1 bitcoin, yeah, but you could also pay 9 dollars for 0.001. You don't have to buy a full bitcoin.

>The language is vague and silver lined. Nodes, Universal, Mining.

These are actually not vague, with possibly the exception of mining. Node is just a term for a device in the network. This is not unique to Bitcoin or blockchains. Universal just means it's not limited to a specific location. I can use this in Canada, the United States, China, Russia, Zimbabwe, or anywhere else as long as I have an internet connection. The word Mining was used simply because the underlying process results in the creation of some new bitcoin. This was thought to be similar to mining for gold.

I understand your skepticism, but I'm hoping it's a healthy amount. I get that it can be confusing, but there are good resources out there for learning about it. I really do think that if you did, you wouldn't see it as a scam.";2;2;False;SexyAndImSorry;dqd4lon;It's over 9000!!!;7fkqh5;https://i.imgur.com/jyoZGyW.gifv

"I believe being skeptical of new ideas is the right default, especially when you don't fully understand them. I don't think anyone should invest in crypto without understanding the technology.

> The Product is vague- It helps you get rid of mortgage and student loans, is one phrase you'll hear on a lot of PS. Bitcoin has similar language. Decentralized Currency (while tangible) makes it sound very similar to Passive Income. My SO asked what Bitcoin was, I had almost as hard a time explaining scientology as I did Bitcoin. When the product you're selling is hard to break it down into five year old language, it brings up a red flag.

Cryptocurrencies aren't passive income, at a very high level they are a digital form of money that you can fully own, and it doesn't depend on a centralized entity to determine fiscal policy. Some crypto currencies are inflationary, some are deflationary, and many offer unique features. 

When you see people talking about how investing in Bitcoin or other currencies can pay off your mortgage, its because many of us have made a lot of money off of our investments. the issue is that some people don't responsibly disclose the risks associated with buying these unregulated investments. 

> It isn't tangible. The Product is all electronic, except for the money I use when buying it. Why should I use paper money to buy suspicious online money? My default answer would be that I shouldn't.

Many things in the modern world aren't tangible, yet people buy them. We are moving towards a digital-first world where digital goods have real value (in-game purchases come to mind). Even most of the fiat currencies you own are digital, unless you are stockpiling cash. Sure, they have guarantees from the government, such as FDIC insurance, and they are far more stable than crypto currencies, but this is a new technology, and a new form of money which may end up going mainstream.

Buying crypto currencies isn't for everyone right now. Most people should wait until they become mainstream. Those people won't make money off of them, but they also won't take on the risk of losing the money they put in. 

> It's too hackable. I'm concerned with online banking and passwords. I go through all the steps to protect my identity but sometimes it's stolen (according to my bank). With Bitcoin being entirely online, what am I supposed to do if a volatile group from the internet organised a mass hacking of Bitcoin? What if I say something on Reddit to someone and they get loaded and steal all of my Bitcoin? I can fight someone who's trying to mug me irl and my bank informs me when something happens online.

Crypto currencies are no more hackable than money you keep in the bank and in may ways they are less hackable. If someone wants to steal my Bitcoin, they need to find my hardware wallet, guess my pin within 3 tries, and then transfer the money. They can't break into some website or database from around the world and transfer my funds.

If I stored my coins on an exchange, they would be able to do that, but long-term storage on exchanges is something that the community looks down upon unless you are day trading.

The downside to personally storing my coins in a hardware wallet is that I have to protect my own crypto currency keys - I can't rely on a third party if I lose my private key. There are already ways to mitigate that risk, but in the long term, we will likely see services that will store a portion of your key, and require collusion between separate entities in order recreate your key without your permission. 

Crypto currencies are still very new technology, and if they take off, you may even be able to store them in your bank. I personally like having funds that are out of government control along with the funds in my bank and investment accounts, so I will continue to secure my crypto myself.

> The buying of a wallet and the fees of using my money. It sounds like an everyday thing, a wallet...but in Bitcoin you have to make sure to get a secure wallet. I use a metal wallet to hold all my cards and cash, how much more secure can you get irl? The fact that I not only have to spend money to hold Bitcoin (shouldn't there be a universal wallet that targets hackers of other people's wallets?) and the fact that I'm charged money each time I want to use my money (in aware this is the case irl, but Bitcoin is supposed to be better than real money, right?) I just don't want to deal with knowingly spending more than what the price is. Where is that money going anyways?

You can choose to store the private key for your crypto currencies on: 

1. A paper wallet - This won't cost you anything, but isn't suitable for day-to-day use.
2. A hardware wallet - This will cost you $60 - $100, is very secure, and allows you to easily access your funds.
3. A mobile wallet - This is free and gives easy access to your funds, but storing large sums of crypto currencies on your phone is very risk.

Here is what I do:

For the majority of my crypto currency funds, I keep them in a hardware wallet. This is equivalent to storing the majority of your fiat in a bank or investing them in stocks with Fidelity. This is money I won't access often. I have a backup of my private key stored securely across multiple locations.

I then keep some funds on a mobile wallet that I downloaded to my phone. This is like having a debit card. I would never store a ton of money in a bank account that had a debit card because no one is protecting me if someone steals my pin number.

The downside is that, unlike storing my funds in a financial institution, I don't have FDIC insurance. The good thing is that its really hard to steal properly-secured funds. Even using a baseball bat to the knee won't get an attack all of funds because an attacker won't know how many coins I have.

The upsides are:

1. I now have access to a global currency that has a small risk of failing but a huge potential to increase in value.
2. I can use the currency at any location that accepts it all around the world (yes, credit cards also provide this).
3. I have funds that can't be taken from me by the government during an economic collapse.
4. With some crypto currencies, I can do more than send money - I can interact with systems to fund artists and own a portion of their revenue, I can play digital casino games, I can participate in prediction markets, etc...

I actually used crypto currency in Mexico recently to buy some shirts. I didn't feel comfortable carrying around cash, but I felt perfectly safe having a mobile wallet on my phone with some crypto currencies on it.

These benefits aren't something that should currently draw the regular person - most of the people investing in crypto today should be people who see a future where decentralization is the default and is values over centralized control of money and ideas.

> Over 9,000. Well that's very good! Bit now that means I have to pay 9,000 of my money to buy one Bitcoin? What if I transfer my money into a lesser currency? Will it still be over 9,000 ruples?

You can always buy partial Bitcoins (or most other crypto currencies). You can spend as little as a few dollars if you choose. Crypto currencies will have different prices on difference exchanges, so prices will vary by region. That being said, would you want to take your $9000 USD, go to India, and have it be worth 9000 ruples? Of course not - you would want it to be worth the equivalent of $9000 USD. You can look at various exchanges to understand how the price differs by region, but its usually not below the USD price due to people arbitraging.

These are the same principals that all currencies rely on.

> The language is vague and silver lined. Nodes, Universal, Mining. It's an unfamiliar language that seems to me (as someone who avoids schemes) that the language is used to penetrate people's defenses by using buzz words.

If you looked into how banking or credit cards worked internally, you would also see many terms that are unfamiliar to you. Crypt currencies are so new that you are directly exposed to these concepts, and to a certain degree, if you are going to put money into buying these currencies, you should understand these terms so you know how the currency actually works. 

Current 'investors' are similar to someone who might have alpha tested PayPal - the concept and terminology would have been confusing, but eventually, the right abstractions and ecosystems emerged to make it usable by everyday people rather than financial/tech experts.

If you are intimated by the concepts and technical terms, don't put any money into crypto currencies yet. If you are interested in crypto, go do some research, talk to the community/devs and try to gain an understanding of how they work, and if you are still interested, then buy some.

These are early days and there is a ton of risk. You can choose to speculate and buy in and that might result in your making or losing your money. Some of us love the freedom that crypto provides and see the technology becoming mainstream (private and public chains). We bought into the currency because it fascinated us, and we ended up making money on it, but that wasn't our goal.

Is your assertion really that an incredibly valuable industry that uses small amounts of bandwidth and large amounts of electricity won't survive paying proportionally slightly more for one of those?

">  physical attack by global governments 

You think governments of the world would be capable of coordinating together to shut down bitcoin? They can't even achieve consensus on the existential threat of climate change I don't think they will all simply agree to shut down magic internet money.

> 1.5 quadrillion USD. That is the estimated size of currency derivatives markets (quadrillion is a million billion) . You have established players in this game that are extremely old money

And at one point kings ruled the world. Shit changes and a lot of that 'old money' was because those people adapted to large scale shifts in society that they benefited from. 

> if any of these institutions felt any kind of threat from crypto currencies they are capable and would kill it completely, keeping the tech but centralizing authority

Institutions already feel the threat. They are adopting the tech but centralizing the authority is the antithesis to cryptocurrencies. Without distributed consensus all you have is a fancy linked list database. Crypto is the cross over of tech, political and economical ideology that you can't simply cherry pick from and have the same benefits.

> I want a better future too for world economies ,but crypto is not going to do it, to initiate real change you would need a large scale global event

"I don't think you understand the true value of blockchain/crypto. Let's say a software company creates an application, they control it and can decide who access it and who doesn't, their revenue comes feom granting clients access to its application and they can do that because they own it. The good part of owning the application is that they control it but this has a downside, since the company controls it they can't assure beyond all doubt that the application won't be modified or changed in some way, so the clients need to trust the company.
What blockchain allows us to do is to create decentralised applications(dApps) which allows us to take the trusting part out of the equation, the users know without doubt that the rules of the game can't be changed. But this has a downside, you can only assure you can't modify it if you renounce control over it, and that's what happens when you upload a dApp to a blockchain you lose all control over it, even the control to decide who has and hasn't access to it. That's where cryptocurrencies become relevant, the way we have found to give the content creators an economic incentive to create these applications and give them up to the network is by creating a cryptocurrency embedded in its code that solves who has access to it and who doesn't.

The point is to block bitcoin or crypto would mean to stiffle economic growth in an unprecedented way, the economies that allowed crypto would be hundreds of times more efficient than those who don't, it would be suicide to ban crypto and decentralisation.";2;0;False;Enchilada_McMustang;dqcmbvl;It's over 9000!!!;7fkqh5;https://i.imgur.com/jyoZGyW.gifv

"Mining BTC is only profitable if you use something called an ASIC Miner, which is a specialized machine only for mining BTC. These cost at least a thousand dollars, and have to be bought in bulk usually.

Mining other crypto currencies, such as Ethereum or ~~Litecoin~~ ^1 are something that can be done with a normal gaming computer.

For the legality of it, it is definitely legal. China has had a lot of regulations put in place about crypto currencies within the past couple months, but I believe mining is still allowed there.

If you really are interested consider checking out /r/EtherMining/ for mining Ethereum, or /r/BitcoinMining/ for mining Bitcoin.

Edit: 1) Litecoin is no longer profitable without an ASIC apparently

Also it's worth noting that most miners will tell you that you'll make more money by just buying Bitcoin, instead of buying a miner for it. I'd only look into it if you're interested as a hobby, or mining other coins that don't require an ASIC if you already have a decent graphics card.";1;1;False;crypto-coin;dqcn6bz;It's over 9000!!!;7fkqh5;https://i.imgur.com/jyoZGyW.gifv

"If you are new to Bitcoin and wondering why it's so valuable, please read this:

Bitcoin’s value derives from its current real uses (mainly for money transfers and remittances) its limited supply and scarcity (store of value) and its many potential uses. Also, behind the curtains there is a huge growth in the bitcoin ecosystem development that a regular folk can't see because it's ignored by the media.
> 
> If you buy for day trading you may lose money, but if you hold long term, it has been proven you get nice ROI. And bitcoin has barely started, think of the Internet/email in the 90's. A decentralized technology that has a valuable use it's not going to disappear, even if a few tyrannical governments try to ""ban"" it.

"If you are new to Bitcoin and wondering why it's so valuable, please read this:

Bitcoin’s value derives from its current real uses (mainly for money transfers and remittances) its limited supply and scarcity (store of value) and its many potential uses. Also, behind the curtains there is a huge growth in the bitcoin ecosystem development that a regular folk can't see because it's ignored by the media.
> 
> If you buy for day trading you may lose money, but if you hold long term, it has been proven you get nice ROI. And bitcoin has barely started, think of the Internet/email in the 90's. A decentralized technology that has a valuable use it's not going to disappear, even if a few tyrannical governments try to ""ban"" it.

> Bitcoin is a worldwide-distributed decentralized peer-to-peer censorship-resistant trustless and permissionless deflationary system/currency (see Blockchain technology) backed by mathematics, open source code, cryptography and the most powerful and secure decentralized computational network on the planet, orders of magnitude more powerful than Google and government combined. There is a limit of 21 million bitcoins (divisible into smaller units). ""Backed by Government"" money is not backed by anything and is infinitely printed at will by Central Banks. Bitcoin is limited and decentralized.

Don’t trust exchanges with your funds long term.

Don’t talk about how much bitcoin you own.

Look into buying a hardware wallet such as Trezor.

When sending bitcoin from an exchange to a more secure wallet, send a small amount first to make sure you don’t fuck it up.

Don’t invest more than you are willing to lose.

"If you are new to Bitcoin, remember that:

1) You didn't miss the boat. Bitcoin is still in its early phases and it hasn't yet even come close to reaching mass adoption or institutional investment.

2) Bitcoin is highly divisible. The price is never ""too high"" to invest your first $50 into it - a 200% increase is still 200%, no matter how much of a Bitcoin you've bought, and it is predicted to keep going.

3) The best time to invest in Bitcoin was 7 years ago. The second best time is NOW.

"Lets look at it logically. If you look at any chart, you can see the rate of growth is increasing in an exponential fashion. We went from 3k to 9k in less time than we went from 1k to 3k. If we extrapolate on that basis, we will go to 15k in the next couple of weeks, and then to 25k in less than two weeks. 

If you think well go beyond that, in order to maintain this pump, without going into a scary reversal, or somehow going sideways out of a completely vertical, and lets face it, speculative rise, we need to start gainaing roughly 100 billion dollars in value every week. Then 200, then 300. It gets a bit silly. At that rate, wed catch up with gold by march, and have all the worlds assets under our belts by december next year.
