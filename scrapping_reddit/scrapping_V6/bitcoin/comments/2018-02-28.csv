The Fistula Foundation helps women who have suffered debilitating birth trauma get their life back. An obstetric fistula is a hole in the birth canal often from necrotic tissue after the baby gets stuck for a long period of time. The baby usually dies, so there is that trauma, but then the woman can't hold her urine and feces anymore so she stinks all the time and is rejected by her husband and community. For like $400 this condition can be repaired and this woman has a new lease on life. I think its amazing. I had a traumatic birth experience and would have been one of these women but for western medicine and quick access to a c-section. You can put a life back together for just $400 per woman.;2;0;False;ladyjade3;duypq5y;I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes!

Based in San Jose, California, in the heart of Silicon Valley, Fistula Foundation is honored to have received 12¬†consecutive four-star ratings from Charity Navigator; only 1 percent of charities have received this designation.";2;0;False;IAmElleHeller;duxrdyi;I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes!

Lood no further than the Fistula Foundation, a charity that helps unfortunate women, in the most remote areas of the world. This fund, which has a minuscule expense ratio puts all of its funds into corrective surgery for women with obstetrical fistula. Women with this condition are often ostracized from their family and village. There is a lot more work to be done. ;2;0;False;Jmcglade;duxquzs;I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes!

"If you check out the Fistula Foundation, I think that you will find that they make extremely good use of the funds that they receive.  It takes about $600 to do the surgery that transforms a young woman from a social outcast to a completely restored member of her local society.  This has an impact on the lives of her children and family/extended family for the remainder of her life.   Please consider this highly rated charity for a gift.

And thanks for doing what you are doing with the pineapple fund.......

One last thought - this is kind of 'out there' but there is a profoundly disadvantaged population of indigenous people who are facing the same kind of annihilation threats that Native Americans  faced a hundred years ago.  There are just over 300 million people on the planet who know how to live in non-destructive harmony with nature.  There is an organization ""Survival International""  that intervenes legally on behalf of efforts to leave indigenous people alone.  I personally believe that this profoundly under-funded organization is worthy of much greater support.  If I were fortunate enough to be in your position, they would be a major benefactor.
