I predicted the crash back when it was soaring up to 20k. I forecast the bottom at 5k, and while we didn't quite get there, we got damn close. I'm not going anywhere, and neither is BTC.

Lol.  The iPhone.  Okay.  The company that was the first to break a trillion?  That iPhone?  Yeah, I wish with the iPhone 3 came out I bought apple.  There is literally nothing to compare this to.  You can't say this is more of a bubble than the other 3 times it looked like it and skyrocketed past that point.  You can only define a bubble in retrospect.  I assume sense you know the future of Bitcoin you have tens of thousands of dollars invested shorting it right?  I mean, you have so much confidence why not get rich as it falls.  ;1;1;False;pirateninjamonkey;e50o9y4;Cheers!;9au41d;https://i.redd.it/hmzbd5az5qi11.jpg
"> There is literally nothing to compare this to. 

You're high. This is just like any other technology. New stuff comes out, old stuff dies out. No one is using the iPhone 3g. Bitcoin is as old as the iPhone 3g, and there have been even more ""models"" of cryptocurrency released afterwards than there have been iPhones. Bitcoin has absolutely no technical value in the crypto market. 

>You can't say this is more of a bubble

It has always been a bubble.

"Lol.  It has ""always been a bubble"" that is true of nothing.  That statement doesn't even make sense.  People did buy stock in ""iPhone"" by buying apple.  It did quite well. According to you, to say someone bought Bitcoin at $.001 to today would just be in a 6 year bubble.  You can try to say it's a scam, it isn't, but you can say that.  Saying it was a bubble from the start shows me you don't understand finances. ";1;1;False;pirateninjamonkey;e50p5uu;Cheers!;9au41d;https://i.redd.it/hmzbd5az5qi11.jpg
"> That statement doesn't even make sense

Then you're disabled.

>People did buy stock in ""iPhone"" by buying apple

Yes, clearly disabled. 

We were talking about a specific iteration of technology. We're not talking about Apple. We're not talking about iPhones in general. Neither of those are corrolaries to BTC. You cannot buy stock in BTC. BTC is not a company. BTC is one iteration of a particular technology, and an old model at that. BTC is the iPhone 3g, and equally outdated.

>to say someone bought Bitcoin at $.001 to today would just be in a 6 year bubble.

Correct. You don't seem to know what a bubble is. People can absolutely make money in bubbles, but it's made in a volatile and speculative fashion based in no actual value that ultimately zeroes out.

I'm guessing you don't really understand anything.";1;1;False;;e50pg4v;Cheers!;9au41d;https://i.redd.it/hmzbd5az5qi11.jpg

"Bitcoin is an adaptable technology.  If the iPhone 3 had hardware that could be remotely upgraded for free, along with software, it'd still be popular.  A better comparison is windows, ios or Android in general.  Bitcoin is groundbreaking technology and having been tested so much longer is a huge advantage.  30 years from now, if it is $1,000,000 a coin you could still claim it's a ""bubble""";1;0;False;pirateninjamonkey;e5145aw;Cheers!;9au41d;https://i.redd.it/hmzbd5az5qi11.jpg

">  a technology that has been around less than a decade

So, like the Iphone 3g? Expecting those to go up in price too? Technology gets real old, real fast, and early models get replaced quickly. There is nothing BTC does that isn't done better by another crypto, and that's even assuming crypto does something worth doing. There is no inherent value to BTC, and it's severely outdated as a platform.

>has a history that shows it has to fail

Yes, it very clearly mimicks just about every other bubble in the history of the market. It's in a major downtrend. There is absolutely no logical reason to expect a recovery.

>We will see who is right here.

No, *you* will see who is right here, eventually and far too late. *We* know who is right.

"bitcoin is already slightly beyond being a collectible. And yes Bitcoin is providing a service. people misinterprete it because there is no company behind it charging them. but actually miners charge you for the transaction service. not as a company but as a participant in the network.

">housing starts, durable goods purchases, etc., sales of which I believe you agree would suffer under deflation.

To a limited extent, yes.  However I don't believe this is a bad thing for the economy.  There are other (and better) ways to run an economy than a complex version of the broken window fallacy.

It's not only needs that people would fulfil, but also wants that are significant enough to outweigh the increase of wealth over time.  The only types of spending that would be limited are lesser wants, which tend to be those that are ultimately damaging to the economy and people overall.";1;0;False;dalebewan;e50lwup;Cheers!;9au41d;https://i.redd.it/hmzbd5az5qi11.jpg

I agree somewhat however, currencies usually are not just passing fads. Don't quote me on this but I think gold/ silver was just as volatile when it first became valuable. There are a lot of cryptos out there that are going to sink however, blockchain technology is going to be a revolutionary technology in our near future. That is why my money is on crytpo. Which.. crypto is the million dollar question (quite literally). IMO I think government will be the biggest threat to the future of cryptocurrency because of the decentralization  factor. I think that's one reason why it is taking so long for regulations to set in.;2;0;False;bl0ckchain3d;e5066er;Cheers!;9au41d;https://i.redd.it/hmzbd5az5qi11.jpg
