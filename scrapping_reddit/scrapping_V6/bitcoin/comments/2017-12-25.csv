People are buying as speculators because they hope that bitcoin tech will continue to develop with LN and atomic swaps. Of course today Bitcoin is not very useful. One day it could be a functioning worldwide currency. Remember people bought internet stocks as speculators. Some people got burned. But in the end those that understood the power of the internet benefited. Employers will pay employees in bitcoin if bitcoin has mainstream usage. Customers will pay bitcoin , and employers wont bother to convert it to fiat or another currency because thats a waste of time.;1;1;False;klebber;drpy2jp;2018: lets run for office;7lo56s;https://i.redd.it/oy1bmxd0on501.jpg

Lol ok. What do you think a monetary policy is? 

> You should ask yourself why they wouldn't do that

Cause then they couldn't use the money they're currently printing.

You have failed to explain anything about why my assertion is ridiculous. I think its because you don't know why. You're just asserting things yourself.

They will abandon fiat if bitcoin can scale. If you can send transactions quickly and at a low fee (I‚Äôm aware you can‚Äôt right now) anywhere in the world then people will use Bitcoin. Bitcoin is not taking shortcuts like other cryptos. It is trying to scale in a decentralized way while maintaining security. This is very difficult to do, thus it will not happen overnight. Bigger blocks is a band-aid solution. Side-chains seem to be promising but there are no guarantees, and it has to work the first time the devs cant afford to f*ck up. Again, the internet was not developed over night, it took many years to be user friendly. Bitcoin has similar problems and potential.;1;0;False;klebber;drq0o2f;2018: lets run for office;7lo56s;https://i.redd.it/oy1bmxd0on501.jpg
American tax system. I work in tax. President Trump pushed through a tax cut for the rich and called it a tax cut for everyone.

">People are buying as speculators because they hope that bitcoin tech will continue to develop with LN and atomic swaps

They're buying because they believe it will be worth more next month/year than it is this month/year.

Speculators don't care why that is, whether its because bitcoin is useful or will be useful, or whether its just valuable because of a speculative bubble.

If it was based on the potential long term success of bitcoin then you wouldn't see wild swings because that potential is the same now as it has always been.

>Of course today Bitcoin is not very useful. One day it could be a functioning worldwide currency

And one day it might be worthless. 

It's a mistake to confuse the price of a speculative asset for its future usefulness/success. There are no underlying indicators beyond price to indicate that bitcoin is improving. Market share is down. Transaction times are down. Merchant adoption in the top 500 US retailers is down. Fees are up. Volatility is up.

If it was simply as easy as picking the most valuable/rapidly appreciating assets then everyone would be rich.

It doesn't matter what happens to bitcoins price. Hyper-deflationary currencies don't work and no amount of speculation will change that.

>Employers will pay employees in bitcoin if bitcoin has mainstream usage. Customers will pay bitcoin , and employers wont bother to convert it to fiat or another currency because thats a waste of time.

This is circular logic. ""people will use bitcoin if people use bitcoin"".

Why would they ever abandon fiat? ""because its a store of value""

Okay so buy the store of value with fiat and then continue using fiat as a currency.

No one will try to spend a currency that appreciates when they have access to a currency that depreciates.

This is why gold coins are no longer used as currency but iron and copper based coins are still in use after thousands of years. It's not because Iron or copper are any more frangibile or portable than gold coins. It's because gold appreciates in value too rapidly to be useful as a currency.";1;1;False;suninabox;drpykr6;2018: lets run for office;7lo56s;https://i.redd.it/oy1bmxd0on501.jpg

The federal reserve doesn't print money, the US mint does that.

Because you don't even understand how the current system works, all of your assertions are stupid.

Bitcoin Cash is definitely a step in the right direction.  Idc which wins out as I have a very libertarian mindset for this sort of stuff.

"> Bitcoin absolutely does have the most predictable stable monetary policy of any currency that has ever existed. I challenge you to explain to me how I'm wrong in that assertion. Throwing those insults just embarasses yourself.

One it's not a monetary policy and its predictability is based on sliding difficulty to keep the average daily mining rate constant. If the US government wanted to set a finite amount of dollars it could also release 7200 dollars a day until May of 2140. You should ask yourself why they wouldn't do that and you'll possibly begin to understand how ridiculous you sound and what's wrong with your assertion.";1;1;False;Scared_of_stairs_LOL;drq1tax;2018: lets run for office;7lo56s;https://i.redd.it/oy1bmxd0on501.jpg

"Hi Pine¬† üçç, 
Hope you went through my comment which I emailed to you regarding screening some African based charities which are worth recommending and are definitely doing what they say they are doing in their communities ... As a social empowerment advocate for the past 8 years in Africa, I have personally witnessed so many so called charities and fraudsters take advantage of the misfortune and desperate state of innocent lives to detour and mismanage funds without providing sustainable solutions to the intended beneficiaries they claim to support.

There is need for thorough screening because informed giving is effective giving. Reason why I will like in my humble person, for you to strongly consider these organizations which are putting in the work to create real differences in the lives of their benefactors even with insufficient funds.
