Morality is meaningless. evil and good don't exist. the universe isn't worried about your consent. if allowing others to die because your worried about your property rights is good to you, your morality is flawed. if saving your own life at the cost of inconveniencing other's is good to you, your morality is flawed. taxation is thievery is as war is murder essentially correct but far over simplified to the point of loosing meaning, like an image that's been compressed far too many times.

"i've just read your reference about US military costs for germany. thanks for the link. i would like to point out some additional information that are not covered by this article but i think you should take them into consideration when evaluating the costs.

there are a couple of strategically very important US military facilities located in germany that basically have almost nothing todo with basic european defense or anything of this matter.

one of the most important overseas airbase is located in germany. it is mainly used to cover operations in the near/middle east. it is also used for the US drone programs for that region.

also one of the main military medical centers is located in germany. main usage currently is also for all near/middle east missions.

and last but not least we have the DECIX in germany which covers almost all european and most of arabic internet traffic. so, unfortunately, we also have some important intelligence units here.

another topic of the article is about excess military facilities in germany that are no longer in use because of troops reductions. what the article is missing is, that these facilities, buildings and the plots has been given to the US by germany at no cost in the 1950/60.

as i already said, the truth is most times complex.

"if you are paying taxes and are living here, than yes you are part of the 100% who have agreed to live this way. you just dont fall in the second group i mention of that most of those 100% think its the best way we have now. you think its not the best way. 

and i have answered. long ago at the founding of what we have now as our society the people decided on taxation and that it was how everyone who lived in our society would contribute to it. the majority of everyone agreed to this and it was made into law. as new people are born they also accept this way of living by simply staying here when they reach the age of majority and are considered full members of the society. they can choose not to live this way by moving away. if you dont move away you are in fact agreeing to all the rules set down by those who have come before us. its the same if i choose to visit another country, no where have i explicitly agreed to follow all their laws....except i have, by my simply being there and entering their borders i have agreed to follow all their laws. its the same situation with taxes and living in your home country, sure you havent signed a piece of paper saying you will follow the law but its taken as a fact that since you havent left, you agree to them all. 

you benefit from all this supposed theft and yet you still complain about it. you use the water system, the sewer system, you use govt subsidized facilities, you drive on govt funded roads, you use all that you complain about. if someone steals from you that does not make it right to then go and use other peoples stolen goods, yet you do. if you knowingly use stolen goods, you are no better than the thief yourself.

there is no changing your mind no this subject. you believe to your core that the government is doing something comparable to you as is they were physically raping you. you arent going to change from such an overwhelmingly strong opinion. 

lets just stop here since neither of us are going to change our minds. you think im a blind fool who is being taken advantage of by being lied to and stolen from by the govt. i think you are the greatest example of a hypocrite by using what you claim is stolen from you and others while still complaining about it and also that you are someone who does not grasp the fundamentals of how a proper society functions and who has been misled by large corporations that they can do it better and for cheaper than the govt can, all the while they continue to take more from you than they ever give back as evidenced of their ever growing bank accounts.

"> it has been a long time since i saw german tanks on US streets, so, could you please clarify how the american companies are forced to sell their medicine, pharmaceuticals, and biotechnology to germany?

They're not.  It's not the act of selling that's forced, it's the price they must sell AT that's forced.  They either cede international market share to competitors while taking a beating in the media (""*EVIL* AMERICAN PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY REFUSES TO SELL LIFESAVING DRUGS TO GERMANY""), or they suck it up and sell to these countries basically at cost.  They uniformly choose the latter, for obvious reasons.

And thank goodness they do, because the *vast* majority of pharmaceutical and biotechnology development takes place here, in the United States, which (coincidentally, I'm sure) is the only country that allows people to profit from developing medicinal implements.

>oh, and please provide a reference to any US health care company that made business with germany at a loss.

I didn't claim they operated at a loss.  They *wouldn't* operate in foreign markets if they did.

* You responded to me by setting a dichotomy of either staying with the current system where people pay exuberant prices for health care, or moving to a universal healthcare system (inferred. you might have suggested moving to Socialism and that's a whole other discussion)

* I responded to you by explaining my position of adopting other solutions to healthcare other than universal health care - agreeing the current system is flawed and suggesting we move to one where the government control less (not more) of healthcare.

"I don't know of any good single source, but it's been heavily discussed since the original sidechain paper in 2014. Although it's only briefly mentioned in the paper, one of the main use-cases for sidechains is that you'd do some crazy experimental thing on an SPV-security or federated sidechain -- confidential transactions, say --, and then once this sidechain has been proven stable, secure, and popular after a couple years, you can do a Bitcoin softfork to upgrade it from reduced security to full Bitcoin-security by having all full nodes hard-enforce the sidechain's rules rather than trusting miners or functionaries. (You can also skip the SPV-security/federated phase if you want.)

IIRC this was discussed in one of the talks at the first Scaling Bitcoin conference, but I didn't check.

Sidechains are like extensions onto Bitcoin blocks. After 20 years, a typical Bitcoin block could consist of a 2009-format block with just the coinbase transaction, plus a 2018-format sidechain block with another coinbase transaction and a few remaining other transactions, plus the then-current 2030-format sidechain block containing all of the normal transactions, built on top of the 2018-format sidechain. You could still spend never-spent BTC mined in 2009 by passing it through the 2018 sidechain on your way to the 2030 sidechain, and you can also move BTC in the other direction. Each block has its own coinbase transaction, but only for collecting fees on all sidechains: the subsidy can only be claimed once, of course. When a block is mined, it's mined on all sidechains at once.

After several years, a hardfork could remove the unused layers described above (without destroying any funds) in order to reduce complexity and overhead, but it's not a big deal.

Note that although you can increase the max block size this way, it doesn't offer any *scaling* benefits compared to a hardfork max-block-size increase, since all Bitcoin full nodes still need to process the sidechain blocks. It is good that it's a softfork, so once it's determined that an increase is safe, this may be a good way to do it, especially if we're in a hurry, since an ideally-safe hardfork needs *at least* a year of time-delay.";3;0;False;theymos;dmayk42;A glimpse into the future;6wpdei;https://i.redd.it/7dvqdd5lbmiz.jpg

"> There's tons of different crypto currencies that exist now. If everybody waits for a ""winner"" before they buy in, then none of them will ever get off the ground. But if people do buy in early, and that particular crypto currency loses out to a competitor, all of those people get screwed. Crypto currencies can pop up willy-nilly forever, and every time a new one pops up and gains some traction, old one's will crash. 

I think the cryptocurrencies that prioritise decentralisation above all else (small blocks, 2nd layer scaling, minimal scripting complexity) will be the one to eventually win people's confidence as a secure long-term store of value simply because they will be so hard to completely exterminate. Cryptocurrencies that do not stick to decentralisation principles will eventually have their proof-of-work datacenters or proof-of-stake owners be co-opted by local governments under threat of physical force. I think there is a huge potential for bypassing currencies like USD or EUR with [the version of bitcoin maintained by Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org/) (so long as guys like [Greg Maxwell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThD3_Ed5Bzc#t=38m52s) are in it).
