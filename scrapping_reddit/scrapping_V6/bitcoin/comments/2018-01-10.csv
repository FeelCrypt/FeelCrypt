"It’s a shame because *anybody* can understand *most* of it. 

[Here it is. ](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) 

People: At least read the abstract. 

[This video](https://youtu.be/bBC-nXj3Ng4)  by 3blue1brown is the best there is to beautifully explain “what is bitcoin?”. Share. ";2;0;False;Allways_Wrong;dsgb9ck;Everyone who's trading BTC right now;7olruz;http://cdn.mutually.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/08-19.jpg
"It’s *very odd* that a couple, or very, very few people have lost *large sums of money* using either a Trezor or a Ledger. 

There was some guy lost 250bch on a Trezor his first try. To me it sounds all very suspicious and frankly impossible. 

I am almost sure these are smear campaigns against the companies. ";1;1;False;Allways_Wrong;dsgalv8;Everyone who's trading BTC right now;7olruz;http://cdn.mutually.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/08-19.jpg

"It was a Ledger Nano on eBay where the seller printed a fake, legit-looking peel-off ""recovery seed"".

"Yeah, but if Bitcoin fixes its issues via second layer tech like Lightning, and then goes on to add what amounts to an “open world” programmable environment with side chains, then goodbye alt coins. 

Lightning is now in beta on MainNet and so is RootStock. And everything is looking very good. 

Bitcoin is the only battle-tested turtle in this race, with a massive head start. 

Alt coin fanboys saying bitcoin is dead might end up eating their words, just like everyone else that said that has. 

It’ll happen in 2018, and very suddenly. 

I don’t know tho. ";1;0;False;Allways_Wrong;dsgaxbp;Everyone who's trading BTC right now;7olruz;http://cdn.mutually.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/08-19.jpg

This is very true, a lot of people buy bitcoin and think they are some extremely clever geniuses because the price is going up.;1;0;False;thebezet;dsh5pak;Warren Buffet:;7o9zo1;https://i.redd.it/epko0verp7801.jpg
