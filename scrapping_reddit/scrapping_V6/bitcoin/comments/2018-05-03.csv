Credit unions tend be much smaller and limited to a particular area, at least they do in my country. Therefore you have many smaller points of aggregation, and even the catastrophic loss of one credit union wouldn't have much, if any, impact on others, whereas we allow mainstream banks to become too big to fail, even internationally. Centralisation isn't a binary metric. It's tiresome how many people ignorantly suggest it is, especially on this subreddit, where people ought to know better.;0;1;False;pepe_le_shoe;dyde8il;What a time to be alive!;8g8vqu;https://i.redd.it/rbt35cjw89v01.jpg
Bitcoin was crafted specifically to replace Central banks, not commercial banks. (Money issuers, not lenders.);1;0;False;Coinosphere;dycqrwc;What a time to be alive!;8g8vqu;https://i.redd.it/rbt35cjw89v01.jpg

What about a credit union isn’t centralized? The members deposit their money into a CENTRAL location that is the credit union. The credit union then loans that money out from the CENTRAL location to make money. Again, the only real difference between a bank and a credit union is a bank makes money by charging more for loans than it gives back to the people it’s borrowing from, while a credit union gives back more to cancel out those profits. It is no less centralized. Perhaps I shouldn’t explain this though, I wouldn’t want your head to explode...;1;1;False;bobsmithjohnson;dycpw5m;What a time to be alive!;8g8vqu;https://i.redd.it/rbt35cjw89v01.jpg

"No, I don't but I've been in crypto for six years.

>So bitcoins price will have hit a million dollars with just one order and for that one instant everybody's bitcoin would have been worth one million dollars

That's why they have average and close of day price etc. Anyway, you could argue the other way. Someone bought ETH for ten cents or something last autumn but that did not mean ETH's market cap was obliterated.

>Market cap doesn't equal total money supply bought in to the coin, market cap is the PAPER value of all the coins.


All things being equal you could say that about any money or asset. Gold has a trillion dollar market cap but using your logic if everyone decides to sell it all...

My original point still stand. I'm sure the banks are not happy that, to pick even one individual to avoid your obsession with market cap - one the Winklevosses or Tim Draper, say - that his/their assets are not being stored in a bank instead.";1;1;False;ebaley;dye4z5d;What a time to be alive!;8g8vqu;https://i.redd.it/rbt35cjw89v01.jpg

So you mean like a local bank? Again, your point has nothing to do with credit unions, and just with scale. It also has nothing to do with the original points made about bitcoin and how it in no way replaces the role of banks as lenders. Let’s just face facts, you made an asshole comment about credit unions that made no sense and had nothing to do with the comment chain, you were shown to be an ignorant asshole, and now you’re grasping at random other points to try and recover. ;0;0;False;bobsmithjohnson;dydng5k;What a time to be alive!;8g8vqu;https://i.redd.it/rbt35cjw89v01.jpg
"people can belive whatever they want but the facts remain bitcoin has never really had a bad year, the only real crash and bear market was mt gox. And even then... if you just hodled all the way since you'd still 20x at the ATH...

And even if you buy bitcoin you havent lost your money... you can buy dollars for it at online casinos, or just simply cash it out... its not like spending it on a resturant or something where your money is eaten

Who knows what bitcoins potential truly is, but just simply saying its a ponzi and disregard all possibilites of a new skyrocketing price seems so boring.";1;0;False;the_evil_priest;dycv0gt;What a time to be alive!;8g8vqu;https://i.redd.it/rbt35cjw89v01.jpg
