Hi, Our team has been working mostly passionately on the SEAing Breath project focused on ocean advocacy via virtual reality and deep breathing the past years. It has been presented for free at museums and public places to people all ages and background. Many learned about sea level rise, how to help the oceans and about breathing to lower stress, anxiety and depression for the first time. We would be incredibly grateful for any support! https://seaingbreath.com/2017/02/06/project-mission/ and @seaingbreath on insta. We also developed a breathing VR experience for deep breathing without funding this year: http://www.mishurenko.me/awere Thank you!;1;0;False;hannesbend;drkzelc;I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes!

I always wished there would be someone who donates small amounts to students because being a student can really suck (from a financial pov)â€¦ Also here in Germany it's not as expensive as it is in America, it still can bring you in troubleâ€¦;1;0;False;Fre3mind;drkh6ws;I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes!

"Have you considered donating toward mental health for the developmentally disabled?  It's a particularly forgotten realm in the charity space without much glamor, but given that they experience emotion on a spectrum beyond what we're capable of, mental health for them (and their families) is incredibly important.

I submitted an application for them a week ago and haven't heard back from you, though I think about it every day. Please see what you can do, and consider donating! The charity helps those with developmental disabilities achieve mental health through art and hands on workshops and has an amazing track record: http://www.beingstudio.ca/  I recommend spending a few minutes on some of the artist bios!  

Anything will help them really, but they're at a deficit every year now and could really use an endowment. Do you think you'll be donating?  Should I apply again?

PS: I didn't mention this in the application I made but the website is new (formerly H'Art of Ottawa, so if you google that it'll bring you to the new site as well), but the charity is still using H'Art of Ottawa email, and can't afford to have someone set up the new email yet, so don't use the being studio email address because we can't access it - use admin@hartofottawa.ca instead. 

Thank you for reading!

"My dog, [ollie](https://i.imgur.com/lSRqASG.jpg), is a rescue. I'm trying to keep an open mind, instead of jacking off on my adopted-pet high horse and crucifying anyone who isn't up here with me.

Totally true! In my area, most of the shelters are filled with senile or sick doggoes. I found [ollie](https://i.imgur.com/lSRqASG.jpg) at a stroke of luck in one of 'em, but I am always cognizant that there are risks associated with adopting (just as there are risks when buying from a breeder).;2;0;False;Anaklu;drkx7ha;Sold some bitcoin to buy my new best bud ðŸ¤—;7kqq1j;https://i.redd.it/16bgn309ys401.jpg
