I figured that was what was happening, but was wondering if there was some alternate reasoning.

"Enough that it's worth selling, and thus I've found out how inconvenient it is to turn it into USD. The fact that it is hard to spend saved me from cashing half of it out back when it was in the $2,000 to $2,500 range.

By the time I got my act together and started doing something with it, the price had gone well past $3,000. I still have about 80% of what I mined. I'm still spending what I can directly and looking to turn small chunks to USD as I go. Every transaction ends up being smaller than the one before (smaller in BTC for the same amount of USD I pull out).

Hopefully it keeps going up. I'll hold a bit in reserve in case it just never stops going up in value. No idea what would make me sell the reserve portion. I suppose if the reserve got too high in value I'd reduce the amount of BTC in the reserve in that same way (smaller chunks of BTC to get a fixed size chunk of USD).";1;0;False;dhanson865;dqqcqkk;Lily Allen turned down 200K in Bitcoins for a gig in 2009 which is worth $1,426,199,000 as of this writing;7aq0fx;https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/lily-allen-calls-herself-an-idiot-for-declining-bitcoin-payment-now-worth-millions-9046211.html
