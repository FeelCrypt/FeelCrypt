"Your original comment. 

>They make 1 battery bank type and when you pay extra you get more kwh unlocked. Its logical to manufacture only minimum differences in components, all car manufacturers do similar things.

Tesla does indeed make more than one pack .. ( I believe you conceded this point already ) 

Next we look at the second point. **all** car manufactures do ""similar things"" 


The ""things"" that tesla did , was to have a software lock that degrades both range and performance. 

I concede that most ( if not all ) automakers will use similar , if not identical parts across various lines. I just do not agree that using the same steering rack for all your lines is anywhere near the same 'thing' as having a software lock ( that you can pay to have removed ) that degrades range and performance. 


Next , lets look at the word ""similar"" for a moment. Because I believe this may be where we are having the biggest difference of opinion. 

From https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/similar

>1 :having characteristics in common :strictly comparable

>2 :alike in substance or essentials :corresponding
no two animal habitats are exactly similar —W. H. Dowdeswell

>3 :not differing in shape but only in size or position similar triangles similar polygon

What tesla did with these two specific models is to have a software lock that degrades both range and performance. 

GM making 4 versions of its LS1 with various internal parts and or different induction systems does not fit the definition of similar 

GM de-tuning a 700 HP version of its LS1 for use with a 'less strong' transmission does not fit the definition of similar. 

What would be similar ( even though it doesn't degrade range )  would be requiring ( or giving the option to ) a hellcat buyer to pay an additional fee to get the red key. for reference https://artofgears.com/2015/11/10/this-is-why-the-srt-hellcat-has-two-keys

GM doesn't sell a version of the hellcat without the red key. 

To side track for a bit , you compare a battery pack to a gas tank. Close , but not quite.  The size of the battery pack is the bottleneck for two major things. The range ( which makes it similar to the gas tank in that respect ) however it also determines the peak current output of the pack. A battery technology and construction method determines a batteries ""C"" rating. To figure out the peak current the pack can provide , you multiply the C rating by the size of the pack.  a 60kwh pack would be c X 60 as the peak , a 70 would be 70 X C.  Tesla did not software limit just the range , they also limited the peak current. The software lock causes the larger pack to perform exactly the same ( similarly to ) a physically different pack.

"No, the correct term is an OEM Options dealer. Once I am home I can happily scan to you the brochure of a factory commodore from Holden listing the options from Walkinshaw, a list in the same brochure as Holden's options. Also they don't purely rebuild vehicles they can do option packages coinciding with options from Holden. So unfortunately you're incorrect in that part.

Regarding my original statement, of course they do seperate sized Amp/hr packs for their range of vehicle classes. But for a single vehicle model, a single battery package is the most cost effective option. No car manufacturer installs 4 different types of fuel tanks for 4 different options levels on vehicles, so why being battery packs are fuel tanks for electric cars would Tesla do any different?

To continue with the discussion points I have brought in every single comment thus far. Show me another all electric vehicle that is semi autonomous and highly computerized? I know for a fact many Mercedes models, BMW models both have many options that a simple software install will allow use. Even most lower value cars have options that software will allow the upgrade to be used. Sat Nav is an obvious upgrade. Most vehicles have the facilities from the middle models up, some require a simple software update to access it. 

You speak of changing goal posts yet in your last paragraph you talk about going from a base package to a top of the line. Even in ICE powered cars this is clutching at straws. Nowhere have I spoken about going from a 30,000 base model car to a 70000 top of the line car. Tesla's upgrade option is not like going from a 2ltr 4cyl to a 7ltr 600hp v8. You seem to be creating strawmen to simply attack my valid point without ever countering the argument with your own. So i return the question, what is your issue in a free global market of a manufacturer with hundreds of millions of cost in RnD, creating a system of ease of install and a simple process for those willing to pay to be able to ascertain an upgrade? 

My personal favourite part of this whole discussion is yourself saying ""Tesla would actually install a larger pack and software limit it to a lower capacity as Its cheaper to produce one battery pack and software lock it , than to produce and install a lower capacity pack."". So now we have proven your simply being argumentative for some petty reason beyond comprehension I think our discussion is done.

The correct term is ""remanufacturer"" The car gets a COMPLETELY  new vin number ( not just a few digits changed for option packages ) , it's in no way OEM. its no longer a holden. OEM is ford's SVT or subaru's STI or toyota's TRD or mercedes AMG. Walkinshaw is the same thing thats done here in the states with saleen and their mustangs.  You don't go buy a holden , give it to them , and they give you back an upgraded holden. THEY go buy a holden , and build you a walkinshaw. 

>My original statement and logic is coherent throughout our discussion.

I agree that its legal , I can not agree that its regular.

"When it gets too easy to make money, that’s when u may want to park some of your cash elsewhere.  The FANGS are steady but boring, so u make 50% in year? Boring, but steady.  

We are still in the early stages of a Bitcoin bubble, think lots more to go. But don’t expect a steady ride. Sorry to say there are people out here that are out for blood, they’re called traders. Most of them go by the name of C++.  They have no mercy.  

So diversify.   Just a tip. :-)

And do your yoga of course.  But I digress from the topic at hand.
