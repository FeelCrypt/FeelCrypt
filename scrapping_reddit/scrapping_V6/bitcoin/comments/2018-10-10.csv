"Ok, I'm digging this up for you, ignorant ungrateful SOB.

What is the required reserve ratio in the US?

Effective April 2, 1992, the 12 percent required reserve ratio against net transaction deposits above the low reserve tranche level was reduced to 10 percent.

"I'm afraid not.

The Chinese mining farms found out the hard way that they don't have power courtesy of the UASF. They are toothless now.

Devs can only propose changes. It's up to the community to adopt them. Criminals have no special power in such a system beyond the same tools everyone else has - persuasion and participation in establishing concensus.";0;0;False;ebliever;e7ha8dm;"Upvote to get this to the top search result for ""Bitcoin CEO.""";9mggze;https://i.redd.it/h2dla06uozq11.png
"No, you are. What you said was banks can lend 10x the amount of money they have available which is patently untrue.

What you have shown is the percentage of cash on hand banks are required to hold of their total deposits, not even counting what they are insured for by the FDIC in the case of a serious bank run.";1;1;False;ProWaterboarder;e7hyg2q;"Upvote to get this to the top search result for ""Bitcoin CEO.""";9mggze;https://i.redd.it/h2dla06uozq11.png

"With Bitcoin, there is 3 possible kinds of ""upgrades"", each with a different difficulty of being realized. In all cases multiple people are involved, anyone can propose changes, anyone is free to accept or refuse changes.

* \[EASY\] non-consensus based upgrades: these do not require to change the underlying rules of the network, and rather just build other layers on top of the existing infrastructure. A few people can accept to use it and it'll work without needing approval from everyone. (example: Lightning Network)
* \[MODERATE/HARD\] consensus upgrades with backward compatibility: you need to have a majority of users to agree to the change. But reaching that majority can be progressive since it's backwards compatible and won't affect users that do not upgrade immediately. (example: Segwit)
* \[NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE\]: non backward compatible consensus upgrades: aside from a few bug fixes in the early days (when barely a handful of geeks used Bitcoin), these have never been successfully achieved on the grown up Bitcoin network as it is today. These require everyone to agree at the same time to the new rules.

"It is true.
Anyway it doesn't even matter as the old banking system is going down.  Not sure what you are doing here defending it.  My guess is, judging by your handle, your political affiliations are probably such that you are upset about everything else happening in the world (Kavanaugh, etc) and carry a chip on your shoulder.

Even if I was wrong, it is a real shame we cannot even have a civilized debate.";2;0;False;BigJim05;e7j14b9;"Upvote to get this to the top search result for ""Bitcoin CEO.""";9mggze;https://i.redd.it/h2dla06uozq11.png
