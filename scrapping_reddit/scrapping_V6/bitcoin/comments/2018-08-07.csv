"As I always say, most people seem to forget about the utility of ""immutable ledger""...

Take in the case of land grabbing... land grabbing by the rich is often done by making a newly created title and faking all the supporting records (through buying them out), then buying the court so ur title becomes the ""fake"" one... 

An immutable ledger won't allow u to ""fake"" or alter the records (theoretically)...

This is what happens in our country... if this doesn't happen to urs, then u likely live in a first world..but ur country is not the majority in this planet...

Which brings me to the conclusion, its not the first world that will spread adoption...

"The value of insurance is the sum of thousands of unlikely situations in which it may become useful one day.

* How likely is it that i get stuck in a foreign country without cash?
* How likely is it that Visa goes down for 2 days and your credit card stops working? (Like it did in the UK just last month)
* How likely is it that you may want to withdraw more cash from an ATM than your bank will allow in 1 day (for some people, this limit is literally $500?
* How likely is it that your bank makes a mistake and accidentally locks/freezes your credit card?
* How likely is it that you become a victim of identity theft, and your bank freezes all your bank accounts? Similarly: Do you think it will get resolved in <1 week?  What if it doesn't, yet you need to pay rent? Buy food?
* How likely is it that the UW government starts printing more money?

And yes, many of these scenarios *could* be satisfied with cash. (disclosure I also have $500 in cash in my house for this exact reason). However, you can't store that in your brain and transport it on planes without questions.  It can be confiscated, stolen, burnt, etc.  Storing $100,000 in your house? Riskier.

Lastly: I don't think *that* many people living in India thought that it was *likely* that their government would spontaneously decree that **all cash-bills over $20 would become illegal** **overnight.**  But it happened. and it caused a massive 2-month-long run-on the banks to exchange their now illegal $100 bills for cash. That happened less than 1 year ago.

People in America probably didn't think it was likely that the government would make owning gold illegal and confiscate your stash of gold.  But it happened.

Nothing seems likely untill it occurs, then you're shit out of luck.

"Well, it's not very likely at all, but you said ""I see no scenario,"" so here's a scenario: A way of deriving ECDSA private keys from public keys is discovered specifically for secp256k1. There is no way to hard fork to a new signature scheme to fix this, because fundamentally the only thing distinguishing the owner of some bitcoins from non-owners is that the owner knows the private key and the non-owners don't.

You can't hard-fork by having a new transaction type that is ""okay, I'm transitioning over to this new key for a non-broken signature scheme"" because then it's just a goldrush to issue those transactions to scoop up all the coins, and the people who hear about this first and automate that process will end up scooping up all the coins.

Wrong.

A) Bitcoin cannot be a viable alternative to fiat if the total market cap is too low. there needs to be enough liquidity to make a currency viable.

B) Wanting something to become a currency (medium of exchange) is not mutual exclusive or in conflict with viewing something as a speculative investment. The first reason for this is that there are transitional stages. Bitcoin may become a currency and become stable, but in the mean-time there is speculation potential. Secondly, the economic reasoning underpinning Bitcoin is that medium of exchange and store of value are not mutually exclusive.

"I've gained knowledge of this over time while doing massive amounts of research. It took several awakenings and eye opening scenarios to get to this point. I'm able to take a step back and observe where we are headed if we do not change. The warnings are all around us. Our Earth is begging us to wake up and make a change. We are being severely lied to and unknowingly enslaved by our own governments. We need to wake up and take back our true freedom. I believe that it's time for love to conquer evil, as evil has reighned for what seems like almost 3,000 years, but primarily in the past 100 years have been the most sickening.

 Adding chemicals to our food and water, letting millions die when there is plenty of money and food, lieing about our history, making us feel weak, small and powerless. It's all bullshit. If we don't wake up our true selves, we are looking at a global massacre/extinction in the next few years. The government is already prepared for this event, there are hundreds of FEMA camps with Billions of coffins in them all over the USA alone. We do not WANT this to happen...even the government does not want this, but they see no other way, they do not understand how they can fix the problem. They ate afftaid, just as we are. But luckily I KNOW how to solve the problem and so do a few others. I'm working as fast as I can with the knowledge I have to help make this change. It starts with spreading the words of the truth in every way I can, to everyone I see.

We all know in our hearts that we need to do something but we are easily distracted by life. A life that does not need to be the way we've been made to believe. We are all slaving away to the system that they've creating and we are the ones feeding it. There is so much more. We must open our hearts and minds to the truth. We must stop feeding the system and giving them what they want. We need to eliminate fear from our thought processes. As fear dissapates, amazing things begin happening in your life. 

We are much like magnets in that we attract what we think about, we must learn to think positive at all times regardless of circumstance, and believe it or not this is possible. I am living proof. I have not retained a negative thought for at least a couple weeks. One still slips through every now and again but that's going to change. I plan on being a main player in this global paradigm shift. Right now I'm just trying to wake as many people up as possible and get people to begin researching the truth. Because you CAN do something. You are not just one little powerless person. You are in fact very powerful, we just need to learn how to harness this power that we all have. I am getting extremely close to a massive breakthrough for history to write about.

Stay positive and always seek the truth. Question EVERYTHING. Everything you currently believe about life is a lie, it does not need to be the way it is right now. There's so much more to life than you can even currently fathom. Much love

Work will no longer be necessary, trade will no longer be necessary, therefore currency will not be necessary. Just lives of pure creation and inner development. Anything you can ever imagine will be done with your mind and your mind alone. The power to Materialize or dematerialize any object ever in existence throughout every universe at the power of your fingertips. Lives of pure creation, love and bliss.

We are currently headed down a dark path if things do not change. Luckily good will prevail this time around. So until everyone, or at least most of us are at this new level of understanding that is already inherent within us, we will always be forced to feel the need to exchange instead of simply give. Everyone naturally loves to help others, but instead we go against our intuitive feelings and actions in order to take from others or be better/more powerful than others. These behaviors have been taught to us by whoever is running the show in order to dull our true selves and the god given power we all have, that we are completely unaware of because it has been very well hidden from us by governments and whoever/whatever runs them. We have lost ourselves, luckily we can say it's not our own fault because we've been so severely lied to. But now that the truth is actually out there, it is our responsibility to take control once again, which is happening slowly but surely. We cannot let them win and destroy ourselves.

There will be many alt cryptos that spring up at first but eventually they will merge when the people recognize that they are only being created in order to make some type of profit off the less fortunate which is exactly what we are trying to combat. We need everyone to be on the same level equally, that needs to be globally recognized. We need to simplify things and eliminate excess information and junk that doesn't need to be there and the best way to do that will be to merge cryptos eventually in to one globally accepted currency. It just makes the most sense for everyone once we eliminate thoughts of the need to profit, because profit will not be necessary, all will be nearly equally rich at this time. We are basically going to distribute all currency evenly to every human being who was willing to adopt this new evolutionary state of mind of equality. Those who choose to keep their greedy and primitive level of consciousness will just eventually get sick and die off very quickly. But that choice would be completely up to them. Greed or be equal, live or die? I'd choose equality and so would any other good person. 

This is just the way things will unfold as we undergo this global paradigm shift in the upcoming years, it needs to happen this way for mankind to realize the truth and to take our next huge positive step in evolution. We have actually been going backwards in evolution due to our primitive mindset that has been instilled in the minds of the people by the few greedy trillionares who run the planet. There is clearly something severely wrong with them. So power hungry that they allow millions of human beings to starve to death or die of poverty every year. It's very sick. We need to change our thinking, and it's surely happening";1;1;False;Noophatuated;e3qvwjy;How To Invest In Bitcoin;953ays;https://i.redd.it/cd9zqif6die11.jpg

When the currency you are working with is suffering from hyperdeflation, an exchange is taking a serious risk buying such a volatile asset.

"In 2010 Julian Assange started accepting Bitcoin. I remember this happening and I knew Bitcoin was a thing. It was basically a way to jump through a LOT of hoops to give an alleged rapist some money.

Silk Road lasted from 2011-2013. At that time, Bitcoin was absolutely known as a thing. Again itwas used as a way to pay for shady things.

The idea of buying Bitcoin for Silk Road was incredibly unappealing - to get it, you either had to trust some weirdos on the internet and send them actual money, or you had to spend time ""mining"" on your own GPU. (And remember the bitcoins weren't worth much so you'd have to mine a lot of them to get enough to pay for drugs.) Then you'd get into the ""Dark Web"" and hope that a different weirdo didn't cheat you or rat you out and then MAIL YOU drugs, which raises the risk that a dog at customs or USPS will find the drugs and then you'll get arrested.

In short it made no fucking sense at all to get Bitcoin back then. If you wanted drugs, the smart thing to do was, you asked your stoner friend to get some for you and you gave him a little extra for his trouble.

There is absolutely no reason that Bitcoin deserves a high valuation other than as a form of speculation. Yeah, sure the banks might get together and make cryptocurrency a thing, but why would they do it with Bitcoin instead of making a new cryptocurrency?

Bitcoin is about consensus. That's what satoshi wrote in his paper. But bcash ignored consensus and forked in open rebellion to bitcoin. Since then, the money behind it has posted misleading things about bcash being the real bitcoin, etc.

"""none of the scenarios above are stopping you from purchasing bitcoin when you need it.""

Think critically about what I typed. Don't just think ""how can I prove this guy wrong"" - because you can't read my post and then logically say that.

Your reply is like saying: ""Why do you store emergency drinking water in your house?  When the water gets shut-off during a hurricane, you can just run to the store and buy drinking water when you need it."" - it doesn't make sense. You must have the stash in-place *before* the need arises.

\- If your bank account is frozen, bitcoin would only help you if you *already* had a stash of them. You can't buy bitcoin if your bank account is frozen.

\- If you're trapped in a foreign country and someone steals your wallet. Bitcoin would help you.  How are you going to buy bitcoin in a foreign country at that point ""now that you need it""?

\- If the IRS wrongly seized your assets (this happens all the time), then takes 3-months of lawsuits to clear-up, how are you going to pay for things?  How are you going to pay for $40,000 in legal expenses? Buying bitcoin at this point would not only be impossible (considering your frozen assets), but it also wouldn't solve anything to use your small remaining cash to buy bitcoin.

\- If you really want it, there was a great article written by a blogger and computer-science teacher.  He accepted Adsense advertisements on his blog from some online casino banner-ad.  Little did he know, that one of the advertisements was paid for by a Russian which had ties with the mafia.  The FBI raided his house, seized his computer, and accused him of accepting funds from the mafia, and pegged him as a cohort.   The article describes how helpless he was in this scenario.

They froze his bank account and seized the assets in his home.  They gave him a plea-bargain of 1-year in prison.  He hired a lawyer, but couldn't afford the 6-month legal battle. He literally almost took the plea bargain because he didn't have access to his money.  He cashed-out his bitcoin to pay for his lawyers. He was found innocent.   I can find the article if you want, but will take some time.

"LOL. 

It's now ""crashed"" and come back from the dead to shatter records and people's perception at least three times. How many more times does it need to happen before people understand that it's a pattern that will repeat itself over and over and over again? 

Bitcoin is an investment, that's true. You must be pretty young but most people hold their investments for years. I do think bitcoin is relatively useless as a currency, it's a problem that I don't think even needs to be solved, we don't need a new form of currency we just need a place to put our money that will appreciate in value over time without being tied to something extra like the stock market or real-estate. A lot like what gold used to be but digital, something anybody with a smartphone could purchase in an instant without having to go to a place to buy gold, figure out exactly how much to shave off a gold bar, and then finding someplace to store that gold. Nobody has time for that anymore. Bitcoin is like gold 2.0 but on a global scale and it will be seen as the world's store of wealth. 

but that's completely off topic. 

I think eventually bitcoin will make its way into people's 401K's and at that point, it'll moon again. Now tell me, which one do you think the financial institutions will implement for 401K adoption? Bitcoin? Tron? Monero? I think bitcoin's a pretty good bet. ";2;1;False;;e3q6rz7;How To Invest In Bitcoin;953ays;https://i.redd.it/cd9zqif6die11.jpg

"I'm not so sure. 5 years sitting in a 529 in their ""aggressive growth"" portfolio I think had an IRR of around 6% less fees. About half of what it would have been in the market. 

Its only about 1/2 a BTC so its not a big deal but I have more faith in emerging tech than I do in account managers. I also don't trust the 529's. They are managed by states...same as pension funds and some bonds etc. We see very well how all of those accounts work out!

"I first heard of BTC somewhere in late 2009. It looked fun, so I tried to mine it but after reading a few things it looked like too much of a hassle.

I believe I created a wallet and had perhaps a few btc or maybe 0.5 btc or so thanks to these free faucets. But you know, it was worth only a few cents or so back then so I didn't care too much.

Then again in 2010 I saw that it went up, and I believe it was back then that I read that story about someone buying one pizza for 10K BTC. But I was studying in Japan, and had better things to do than to be interested in this kind of stuff.

Reading this thread, there are many people who think about ""WHAT IF"" and I think this is a really bad mentality. What is done, is done. You can't change the past, you can only change the future.

So, is BTC worth investing? I don't know. I'd wager to say yes. Only time will tell how much it will be worth.

"**HOW TO INVEST IN BITCOIN IN 2018!**

1. Search for bad news and DIPs like crazy. If possible, get an app that alerts you when the price drops to a particularly low level.
2. Buy a lot of Bitcoin when there is a DIP (the best time to go into a market is when people are pulling out and the best time to pull out is when a lot of people starts buying into the market).
3. Wait for the prices to go up, then sell as soon as it reaches a set target or as soon as a hack or bad news that usually scares off investors occurs and make EASY money.

Imagine you bought 1 btc for 6.9k right now, then before the end of the month, it reaches 9k and you sell, then wait for the next dip (at say 6.5k) and buy in again, you will be making about $2400 in august alone.

**P.S- You could start lower than this or even buy higher than 1 btc**";1;1;False;bitcoin_simon;e3r1cgb;How To Invest In Bitcoin;953ays;https://i.redd.it/cd9zqif6die11.jpg

"I've thought about this one a lot and I've always wondered what the MOST profitable thing you could do would be if you could go back in time.

The most obvious things seem to be stuff like investing in Apple, but with how many times the stock has been diluted there's no telling how much your shares would actually be worth.  There's also the looming threat of you being investigated for insider trading if you somehow manage to have the foresight to sell at the perfect time to maximize your profit.

That makes bitcoin seem like the best option.  You could buy tons of it without upsetting the market in the early days and then slowly sell it over time since you'd know exactly when the dips are coming.  Obviously you wouldn't want to dump your whole stash at once because that fucks the market but if you were strategic about when you sold I feel like you could milk billions out of it with almost no effort.  You could make hundreds of millions just selling right before the huge China crash when they were going for like 15K a piece.

So people always talk about Bitcoin mining in the sense of strapping a whole bunch of gpus to a computer and destroying your electric bill in the hopes that you'll gain a few pennies. Is anyone out there ACTUALLY mining Bitcoin? Like going down to the dump, digging up old computers, and checking the hard drives to see if there's any coin in them. At this point, that method actually seems more profitable than simply hoping to god it doesn't tank, or you sell it the right time without investing all of it again two weeks later only to lose bigger than you won in the initial sale. All it would take is one hard drive with about a hundred Bitcoin on it stuck in Granny's computer that she threw away to make it way more than worth it.
