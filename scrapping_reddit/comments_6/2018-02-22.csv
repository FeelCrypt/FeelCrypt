You cant. A crucial aspect of PoW is that the work being done is pointless. If it was not pointless, it would significantly reduce the cost for a 51% attack as one could use the hardware for other useful things and thus it would retain value. The whole point is that miners are financially invested and want the best for bitcoin as their investment relies on it. As soon as the miners dont care for bitcoin's future they could use their hashing power for malicious purposes.

Very grown-up response. Have a penny to go buy a sweet.

The majority *do* choose the way for BTC. This is demonstrated by transaction count, output, market cap, hashrate, and every other metric you could possibly use to determine decentralised selection of a crypto.

You do kind of have to argue that it's Bitcoin, because it isn't. It's Bitcoin Cash. If it's Bitcoin, why is it called Bitcoin Cash? You're somehow letting this very basic concept fly straight over your head. If it was Bitcoin, the world would call it Bitcoin.

Feel free to give Satoshi a call and ask for his opinion on scaling. While you're at it, call Carl Benz and ask whether he thinks modern cars are an improvement on his design or not.

If Ferrari took their Ferrari, took out one of the front wheels and centralised (ouch for BCH, almost too relevant there) the other, removed all electronics, took off the roof, removed the suspension and all the other mod cons and called it a ""Car Vehicle"".. well, there you've got the perfect analogy of what Ver's done in comparison to Bitcoin. Funnily enough, just like BCH, only a gullible fool would buy it.

"Imagine the insane opportunity established banks are missing at the moment. For those people that want bitcoin but are scared to adopt bc they are scared they will get hacked (my parents, although I did get my dad to buy some).

The banks could simply say, “We will insure Bitcoin deposits from theft” They could even charge a small premium for this service. You send your BTC to them and know that once they receive it, a hacker can’t get it and you are insured against. 

Purists say, “then you don’t own your money”. The Bank could put 95% of them on cold storage. Just having the option in the world would help adoption. "
This may be a necessary evil. It may scare the public if they feel they will be robbed and there is nothing they can do about it. Adoption would accelerate the moment an established and trusted bank says they will insure bitcoin deposits. 
He's talking about the concept described in the white paper dude. Forget about the implementation of specific coins. 
"Grow up mate. BTC is a decentralised concept, and equals the consensus of the people that use it.

The majority chose the way for BTC. BCH is a hard fork, and is as much bitcoin as bitcoin gold, segwit2x, or Namecoin. If a majority had called it BTC, it would be bitcoin. But they didn't, so it's not. Easy concept to understand really.

By all means, argue that Bitcoin Cash is superior to Bitcoin, but don't humiliate yourself by arguing that it IS bitcoin. You go to an exchange to buy bitcoin, you get BTC. You go to buy bitcoin cash, you get BCH. Attempts to blur the lines show no faith in the merits of BCH.

Would you also argue that a Ferrari is not a car? I mean, all you have to do is ask [Carl Benz](https://www.daimler.com/company/tradition/company-history/1885-1886.html) right?

"> We've only recently been able to see output tallies.

I've only just recently figured out that this has existed on blockchair for awhile now. You can query many different things on the bottom. Also there's a permalink box so you can link the exact view with all the columns.

For example, here's all the BTC blocks with over 5K inputs and 7K outputs:

https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/blocks?q=input_count(5000..),output_count(7000..)#f=id,time,guessed_miner,transaction_count,input_count,output_count,input_total,output_total,fee_total,fee_total_usd,fee_per_kb,fee_per_kb_usd,size

And here's the same thing with BCH:

https://blockchair.com/bitcoin-cash/blocks?q=input_count(5000..),output_count(7000..)#f=id,time,guessed_miner,transaction_count,input_count,output_count,input_total,output_total,fee_total,fee_total_usd,fee_per_kb,fee_per_kb_usd,size

Which is mostly just the flood test from mid-January. But it's proof that BCH can handle **much** bigger blocks, say, [40K inputs and 60K outputs!](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin-cash/blocks?q=input_count\(40000..\),output_count\(60000..\)#f=id,hash,time,guessed_miner,miner_votes,transaction_count,input_count,output_count,output_total,output_total_usd,fee_total,fee_total_usd,fee_per_kb_usd,size)"
"That would fit your narrative nicely if it were true wouldn't it? The fact is, these huge consolidations of dust accounts have always happened on the Bitcoin network, and there's really no evidence outside of people assuming correlation=causation that this explains the recent spike in large size transactions. Go back and look at when the mempool was at it's peak, many blocks were only getting a few hundred transactions due to dust consolidation. Regardless though, the fact is, nobody REALLY knows why the transaction size has spiked for a 2-3 month period of time, outside of speculation. BCH has the same problem on a much larger scale - go compare the average transaction size of a bitcoin transaction to a BCH transaction. BCH fits in way less transactions per 1mb block and the transaction sizes are huge. My best guess is that when you have cheap fees, people are decentivized to use the network efficiently, and you get a bunch of ""spam"" transactions (although I don't think there's such thing as spam)."

"Oh, you misunderstood me.

Satoshi didn't implement fees at all.

A ""fee"" is a price posted by a vendor which, if met, will guarantee the performance of the service.  We don't have that.

What we have is a *bounty*: an amount of money attached to a transaction like bait in the hopes that it's a sufficient lure to get the transaction seen.

I was just wondering why you thought Satoshi implemented bounties, if what he was really after was a market of fees.  Anyone that's studied markets can tell you that a bounty market and a fee market are two radically different kinds of markets (one stable and predictable, one unstable and unpredictable).  Satoshi seemed pretty smart in areas of economics, but this seems like an afterthought at best."

Good. Whatever you do, DONT BUY BTC. it will definitely fail.
"> you were saying we need a fee market NOW.

Said no one ever. The point was to not go down a route that's unsustainable (because we need a fee market *eventually*).

At the time (FUD and misinformation campaigns aside), SegWit offered a superior alternative to a hard forking blocksize increase with much upside and no downside except a small increase in network bandwidth. Miners and service providers didn't seem to care much about the additional capacity. Many mining pools / much hashrate didn't signal support and service providers didn't adopt it once it was activated. This wasn't because SegWit was bad. (We know it works, it just has to be utilized.)

Presumably, some influential miners were worried about what SegWit would do to their income. Certain secretive mining optimizations that may or may not have provided a competitive advantage to some miners were incompatible with the changes. Additionally, Layer 2 applications enabled by SegWit could bring down fees dramatically. So some miners campaigned against it.

Businesses prefered to forward any scaling costs to the network users. SegWit required them to adapt and improve their processes, while a simple blocksize would've have been free for them to the detriment of the network as a whole. So some businesses campaigned against it.

Some of that transaction volume that now seems to be missing was a coordinated spam attack. There's plenty evidence pointing in that direction (some interesting @LaurentMT tweets come to mind). Another portion can be accounted for by acknowledging that some businesses have adopted batching of transactions where one transaction pays several people at once. Yet another factor is that we're in the aftermath of a bubble, where less excitement and use is to be expected.

And of course, $30 fees have had their effect too. But it isn't core's job to support and accomodate ridiculously inefficient usage of the bitcoin network. Users should blame the companies that wastefully use a precious resource and vote with their feet when this results in higher fees for them."
So you look at a few days of info and then draw wild conclusions and you expect me to be able to forsee the future. Good one.

"> In an ideal world that’ll bring about roughly a 20-25% capacity increase.

O_o"
To nibble the bait a bit here. BTC argument is that low fee spam is no problem, just pay a slightly higher fee than the spam and the spam is ignored in preference to the higher fee. BTC logic encourages a fee market to secure the network when block rewards dwindle. With BCH you would need a metric fucktonne of low fee transactions to secure the network on fees alone. But if it's very successful that would happen.
">Maybe remind them that BCH has so far not proven vulnerable to this sort of attack and ask them why that might be.

Good point."
"Fees need to be extremely high to pay for the PoW on small blocks.

How come none of you have an answer to that question? When it suited you guys to choke adoption, then you were saying we need a fee market NOW.

Now that you've successfully driven demand off, you're saying you need a fee market *eventually*.

It's time to tell us when the transition to fees needs to happen because otherwise someone might just get the unfortunate idea that you were making shit up as you go along, just to suit your narrative."
Right. There's a lot of efficient use of space now so counting txs is not a useful metric in that regard. So the website above shows the counts of outputs. (Ex., If you pack payments to ten people into one transaction instead of ten transactions, you'll still have ten outputs to the wallets of the ten people.) We've only recently been able to see output tallies.

I started crypto mid 2017... BTC is a shitcoin to me. I'd prefer to not touch it at all.

"> If the flippening occurred now then Bitcoin Cash would have higher fees than Bitcoin

This makes no sense."
Why do you think it should have flipped by now, do you have any evidence? Because if BCH increased in price, say in a month or two, it will surely take over 50% of the hashrate from BTC, it has done this (albeit briefly) in the past. Also, do you have any evidence that BCH would have higher fees? It can, and historically has, processed >2 MB blocks. I don't see the possibility of fees rising. Also, those who switch to BCH will have no incentive to go back to BTC, because BCH will always have 0 fee transactions and BTC will always have RBF, Segwit, LN, and all of the irreversible problems and complexities that are like a cancer on what used to be a pure and efficient network before the banks got involved.
BTC lost 150 billion USD. BCH lost 40 billion USD. Both saw a dip, but one hurt a whole lot more, especially since it had 5 years to solve the issues that still has not solved.
"Well, BCH is basically starting from scratch as all the business already moved over to other platforms.

I would agree with you then 100%, i just think in the far future, with enough adoption, people adding on would be marginal adoption and thus marginal prospects for speculators and thus there would eventually be more usage than speculation.

Is that even possible?

What kind of news can demonstrate such claim?

I didn’t say BCH was adopted faster than BTC but certainly BTC adoption is going down.. the Transactions rate demonstrates it (and yeah even the outputs per blocks are dropping so no, it is not due to batching)

I think the December fees event make everyone realize that they have to avoid Bitcoin for transactions.. BTC is only good for hoarding.

Isn’t ETH got something like 3x the BTC thoughput already?

I said some time ago that it will be the beginning of the end for BTC if fees start dropping, BTC security rely heavily on fee competition for its security model (PoW), w’ll see how this will play out."

I expect that you will now be compelled by intellectual honesty to go do internet battle with all the people claiming that a fee market will necessarily exist absent a blocksize limit due to this factor.

You could clearly see there were several mb of transactions in the mempool, but they were _not_ being mined despite the 8mb max size. 

Just because you _can_ have large blocks, doesn't mean they will be mined up to that size, for the same reason the argument is that the transactions may not be mined for [insert reason]. 

People here saying things like ""transactions should always be 1sar/byte"" or""transactions should always cost under 1c"", but the reality is you have no control over the network, since bch users don't need to run nodes, its purely down to the miners to control the network and decide the rules. "
Doesn't it have an 8mb block limit? And why are people paying fees if a 0 fee transaction is guaranteed to get in the next block?

No it does not. Artificially limited blocksizes even incentivise the miners to spam the network temselves and raise fees (an thus their income). This strategy also enables big miners to gain more market share, as small miners will leave the network because fees are to high for them to spend their mining rewards. Effectively centralizing Bitcoin BTC mining. This strategy does not work when block are NOT full. Which is one of the reasons Bitcoin Cash is so progressive when it comes to blocksize.
"Except when people actually use it, like from all this ""spam"" these last 3 months."
Did you miss the fact that BCH has mined an 8MB block? Has BTC ever done that?
"It has an 8mb limit, but it's not artificially holding back BCH, and it will eventually be 32mb, hopefully. Some wallets make you pay a fee, so that could be part of it, also if you look at the stats usually 0-fee is fine, sometimes you might need to wait 2-3 blocks, so for good measure you might choose to pay a small fee.

"would you care to specify further about your chosen metrics? i don't see how any of the following would be in BCH's favor:

The same does not go for Bitcoin Cash because it has no artificial block size which forces competition to be the highest fee payer for block inclusion. Even zero fee transactions in BCH will get confirmed very quickly, no matter what others are paying.
"A full node can only guarantee that you follow the heaviest-work/strongest chain which adheres to the consensus rules that your node is programmed to validate according to. It cannot guarantee that your transaction(s) will be included in any given block, that is correct.

The market vote is always an ongoing vote.
"The mistake is assuming that the market for crypto right now has much to do with actual utility as opposed to speculation on future utility. The recent rise in BTC is because some exchanges implemented Segwit, making the Segwit+LN roadmap for BTC seem more plausible.

The market ""voted"" in the sense that they said ""Segwit+LN looks a little more likely to succeed now that Coinbase has implemented Segwit,"" but not in the sense that people were like ""wow, I love buying stuff with BTC."""
Looks like it went from ~10% to ~5%. Much of this was because Coinbase gifted BTC users with their corresponding BCH which lead to a lot of users selling and driving down use. BCH is so young as a currency that it is difficult to make such comparisons.

"Oh, ok. Well, just to make sure you understand, transaction censorship is an example of ""transactions or blocks that would have been valid under the old rules are no longer valid under the new rules"" which is the definition of a ""soft fork.""

"> So, assuming he doesn't want inflation, that talk ist just a long winded admission of defeat?

No, not at all.

His background is science. He states the assumptions that went into his research. This is just how you do this properly. Really, ask anyone who does or ever did this for a living. Ask someone who's outside the BTC sphere. They'll confirm.

And if you want to show that something holds, you look for extra conditions you might want to introduce to show that this something holds *under these extra conditions*.

And that is what he did. It is a *partial result*. But an important one. 

You might be a paid troll and so I might waste my time here. But I remember your nick coming up repeatedly during the blocksize debate, so let me assume you are not.

So, if you would have an ounce of honesty left and are indeed looking for answers, you would stop and think now about what I just said, instead of trying to be derisive.

Think about it. Maybe just for a moment at least. Also, I don't even know where you want to drive with this. I lost my anger since the 2X failure. We simply parted ways then. If you do not like what Peter R. showed, if you think he's all for perpetual inflation, even though I have shown you that he is and was not, well then by all means stick with BTC.

I object. BU is not at all *his* pet project. He's certainly a very important, prominent and productive member, but there's a lot more folks involved, myself included.

We also never wanted to stick it to Core. That is rather a reaction. We want the original scaling plan from Satoshi. We get it in BCH now and not anymore in BTC. So where is the problem?"
If you want to be absolutely sure yout transaction is included in the next block, you still have to use 1000 sat/B fee...
Less people are using BTC than before, which means adoption has halted. The large block size of BCH does allow for more usability. It is absolutely logical to think this way. The most difficult problem that I currently see is that those Blockstream employees will need to re-cork their champaign now, since the fees are so low.
"The interpretation is that BTC just had reputation damage in November/December/January due to the high fees, and now adoption is falling. If they had increased block size limit back in, say, October, then today there would be a lot economic activity on BTC.

Imagine you're Joe Normie just starting to get into crypto and you get told that your transaction won't confirm for two weeks (or more) because you didn't pay $30.

I'm sure the users will start to trickle back into BTC eventually but they will eventually hit that same brick wall -- everyone has to fit into 1 MB (unless the Lightning Network somehow really takes off).

Yep, and I'm one of those who believe that someone was spamming the network on that first weekend of last December. It was pretty obvious. I'm not sure it was 1 person like Ver but it was definitely a spam attack tied with timing on difficulty change and a bunch of BCH shilling for all miners to move to BCH. Call it coincidence or whatever dude, but seemed like an obvious attack to me. That's from my own observations.

I don't get it, were you expecting something else? I mean, the subreddit is r/btc
There is no censorship here, you can talk about all bitcoin implementations...
It's like a holding tank where all transactions are held prior to being mined, ie officially added to the global ledger. BTCs low capacity network cannot process many transactions at one time, so this *mempool* gets backlogged which causes fees and wait times to become extreme. BCH does not have this problem because it can process many times more transactions which keeps the mempool relatively empty.
Unconfirmed transactions 
"The point is: your characterization that we won't have to worry about this stuff for another hundred years or so is blatantly false.

Just upping the limit whenever it is hit doesn't work without subsidizing miners.

"And don't forget also to look at # of transactions being processed. It's way down.
Core killed merchant adoption. Core shills will tell you that fewer transactions are done because outputs are being batched. But even if you look at number of outputs, they are still way down.... Yep they killed the eco-system. I'm sorry there's no other way to say it.

And they'll tell you - LOOK FEES ARE DOWN! and the bahhhhbah of the sheep continues."
"Daily volume, i.e. demand is going down..

You may check any source of daily transaction volume in number of BTC.
 
Fees are going down because of demand going down."
Muh growt! 2 months ago I had my transaction in limbo state for 2 weeks. End result was that I ended up paying with Visa.
And People still overpay fees because of shit wallets
Well done. Transaction fees is at their lowest in 18 months!
The users stopped spamming the network because they left to other Crypto like BCH and ETH.
So what's the argument this sub is sustaining against BTC now? lol
Hodl ?!?
Meaning we should be seeing lower fees now 
They think segwit will keep their backlog clear and cheap too. It's so weird. Another bull run and they'll clog up just like before. Probably later this year. 
"Looks like all those ""sell"" orders over the past few months have finally cleared. Usage is way down."
So the busiest thread in here today is about the btc mempool being cleared out .... presumably because everyone is worried ? 
Guys rejoice the spam attack is over! /S

Are they putting the champain away then?
time to get the blocks to 500kb then! 
"core developers and supporters saw the crash in the transactions volume, the mempool was getting empty and they decided to announce segwit adoption to claim this event as a victory when clearly is a huge declination in adoption

anyone could say ''mempools are getting clear because you killed bitcoin with your high fees and calling it digital gold, store of value, etc''
they are preventing this argument adopting segwit as an excuse making it look like is a victory, you actually can see A LOT of bitcoin core supporters claiming victory in twitter ignoring the number of transactions"
"So what is their explanation for the SPAM attack stopping?

I loved to hear their last twisted logic/paranoia delirium:)"
"This could be the result of fewer people using BTC. The free market is allowing people to switch to better alternatives with lower fees. This is what one would expect to happen.

I would have hoped, this would come from some technical improvements such as the extra kilobytes from the segwit change or some other improvement I had missed. But looking at different charts, the capacity of the network is basically the same as ever, so this just comes from less use it seems... so, even if someone might want to try to spin this as a success, I guess it might be the exact opposite. 
"You're right of course.

That's actually something I've never thought about. BTC only had bigger blocks because it was still working through the backlog. This is gonna be interesting.

That's because of ripple :D

You guys are soooo stupid! If BTC fails then BCH is dead. Why can you idiots NOT see that? Have you not been following the whole market? If BTC goes down it's taking BCH with it you morons.
"If use was continuing to fall, then how come the blocks have been full until today? Maybe just the transactions were larger, therefore the blockspace was being used in a different, and arguably more efficient, manner?

I was expecting bcash discussion at the top as this is a bcash sub.  Just interesting to see how bitcoin is a hotter topic in here than bcash. 
BCH is approaching 15% transaction volume of BTC and is more than DASH, Monero and DOGE combined.  BCH is equal to LTC in transaction volume and not even breaking a sweat.  Likely accepted in more places, too.
">A lot of real demand from users should drive down volatility.

Why do you think this?

(i ask, because maybe you have a valid reason, and i'll reconsider my own view)

I put to you that in fact the opposite would happen, volatility would spike massively as the demand from users would attract businesses and new users who would start ""buying in"", driving up the value and thus spiking volatility.

The ""volatility"" of the last 8 years is nothing compared to when we get proper ""mainstream"" adoption going, we are still a drop in the river."
Interestingly enough I have more use case with BCH than Bcore right now. 
Rather be growing rather than shrinking.  BTC had a 9 year head start with adoption. 
haha
"Learned to use exchanges? What are you talking about? 

Regarding Layer 2 - that are no shops or merchants that use Lightning yet (whether it will gain any significant adoption remains to be seen - right now it is buggy and overly complicated), except for Blockstreams webshop and it is highly experimental.

ho snap.  I stand corrected.  I guess I neglected to check it that week.

"You can never be absolutely sure. If someone sends tens of thousand of transactions with 1100 sat/byte at the same time you will also not be in the next block.

But the same goes for Bitcoin Cash ;-)"
"If you want to be absolutely sure, you have to mine a block and include the transaction yourself. There's no other way to guarantee that a particular transaction gets included, and even if you mine the block yourself the other miners could still collectively decide to orphan your block with your transaction

The transaction fee is only an *incentive*, and by itself it guarantees nothing at all"

And what exactly is the difference between a spam attack and people using the network? Oh right... there isn't any difference.
Even DOGE has about 30% more txs than BCH. https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/transactions-btc-ltc-bch-doge.html#log&3m

More than that even! I think even further than that. Do you do so, too?"
The fee market is meant to replace the mining rewards eventually. Not yet. The fees have mostly been a rather small fraction of total btc rewards.
"Why did anyone think it was a good idea to copypaste gen 1 crypto in 2017?

"What percentage of those December transactions do you think were 'spam' ones? A huge amount of money was earned from fees during the peak so if the spam transactions were a big fraction, this would have cost a lot.

Understanding the interaction with fees and the blocksize limit is a bit complex. It depends how the non-spam userbase responds to increased fees:

* Do they see the big fees and decide to put off making their transaction?
* Do they just *need* to make the transaction right now, and so they proceed as normal, paying big fees?

We can make an analogy of users as a fluid -- compressible or incompressible. The fixed block size is like a fixed-volume chamber, and transaction fees are like 'pressure'.

If users reduce their footprint in response to high fees, that is analogous to a compressible gas --- if you cram more and more users into a fixed volume, the fees rise gradually since each responds by taking up less block space. I think this is what small blockers picture when they think of the fee market.

However my worry is that actually users follow the incompressible case: when they need to transact, they need to transact. They cannot just reduce their footprint. It is extremely dangerous to force incompressible fluids into a fixed volume, since once full, the pressure rises *extremely rapidly* from each small new addition.

If the users are rigid, then no spam was needed to cause that spike in fees. There were simply a bit too many users and so the system ruptured. It's possible someone could have done a small spam attack to push the system over the edge, however, it likely was not even necessary."

It is just because of dip, isn't it?
boycott wallets! They are an attack on bitcoin! 
rapid? we are talking about halvenings. 2016 blocks is perfectly adequate 
"If anyone cares to continue trying to argue logically with BTC supporters this could be a useful thing to fire back at them even though it's pretty silly to believe it in the first place. They're basically admitting that their blockchain is vulnerable to this form of ""attack"" and can be successfully crippled by flooding its transaction limit. One could ask them how they plan to fix this vulnerability in the future. Maybe remind them that BCH has so far not proven vulnerable to this sort of attack and ask them why that might be.

Or just ignore them, probably the more useful approach IMO."
The all time low since 2013 was only about 10 days ago, you might want to zoom out.
"Nano is just bouncing back after everyone shorted/panic sold the Bitgrail fiasco.

It’s still only averaging about 0.5 tps and is too small for any major impact on BTC..... yet."
"so are we gonna see ""bitcoin cash is the real ethereum and its Vitalik Buterin's true vision"" shills or roger's new Ethereum Cash coin soon? :)"
So you're saying that fees already hit parity with the block reward fourteen years from now.  Ok, what's the point, other than it appears you guys are getting seriously ripped off by miners, by your own strategies.
"The cop out that was to get everyone on board with Bitcoin and then bailing out on all that adoption surely must have been devastating across all crypto.

It is important to heal those wounds and tell the people who have been dropping it left and right since 2 years back that Bitcoin (BCH) is the same and is still around.

"I think people have learned to use exchanges rather than blockchain. 

Layer 2 is good for everyone."
A lot of real demand from users should drive down volatility. Traders would then predict demand from either side of the currency pair and smooth volatility further.
"It pains me to see people brainwashed that hard.

Outputs per block is still in that low 3K to 4K range.

Schnorr signatures are the main thing they’re working on that will impact on-chain scaling. In an ideal world that’ll bring about roughly a 20-25% capacity increase.
"Microsoft and Steam left last year while *BTC was at all time highs* That says all that needs to be said about the state of the ecosystem.

I guess Steam/Valve realized that you can't really sell $5 games when there is a $30 network fee to use BTC as a payment. 

The dapp developers are now ETH developers or started their own chains. Any business that mattered gave up on it. Projects like Counterparty were abandoned. The original Bitcoin community exists here now behind the vision of the coin we started with. 
"
"even though 2 months ago they were celebrating high fees and the big bosses were toasting ""champaign""  ... 😂

"
"""fees are down""

You know what THAT means, right ? Now, miners are actually _more_ incentivized to mine BCH, when it becomes more profitable, with fees at parity with BTC."
The major benefit is that you can fit more transactions per block so fees will be lower for everyone.  But yes, legacy will still cost more because it takes up more space in the block.

"> SegWit did exactly nothing to scale Bitcoin

In fairness, that's premature with adoption below 20%. Coinbase and major exchanges are only just beginning to roll it out. Bitcoin has mined a few 2+meg blocks recently. Segwit has plenty of room to grow."
and bch also saw a big dip recently...
"Interesting thought, 

I doubt any significant SPAMMING ever happened, no SPAMMERS in its right mind would go through $0.5 constant tx fees without having significant direct gain to make out of it."
Segwit is a 75% discount. And yes, it so still doesn't make them price competitive with BCH.
"I am still not clear on one thing: If segwit adoption is 99% , will there still be a discount vs legacy txs? 

Or there is only a discount when compared to legacy being majority of txs? "

"That's only for hot servers. Archival servers cost almost 50x less. 

And even then $250k/year is NOTHING if you're a miner or business that relies on full nodes. And petabytes is only needed for GLOBAL adoption. The block reward TODAY on Bitcoin (BTC) is half that already. They can cover that cost by mining TWO blocks. That's how dirt cheap it is."
Yeah, optimizations are a must. Thank you for the article. I'll give it a read that as I'm on my way to with and probably should be reading. Let you know my thoughts in a bit! 
"It's not ""just"" big blocks. Scaling to billions of people with big blocks will need a lot of optimizations. But it's not something that can principally not be done. 

I found this article from openbazaar dev Chris Pacia as a good summary of my position: https://www.yours.org/content/can-bitcoin-cash-scale-on-chain--4c977e7218cb"
I feel our definitions of dirt cheap is very different,but whatever suits your agenda :-)
Cheap is relative. Compare storage prices in the past, and you'll say the prices today ARE cheap.
as far as I know, AWS charges more than 250k USD a year for petabyte storage, so yeah its dirt cheap. 
"You need the block data in case of reorgs. So let's say your current last block gets wiped out by two other blocks that are connected to the block before your current last block. But I'd say with e.g. 2000MB so the last ~13 days of the blockchain you're safe.

PS: so let's say we have gigabyte blocks. With a 2 TB HDD you could store the last ~13.8 days of that chain. That's more than you need."
But how long will that last? Idk, it just seems like too trivial of a solution to have everyone on the planet and even the iot using the bitcoin blockchain. I understand your side and i don't necessarily think it's wrong or it won't work, I'm just skeptical of big blocks is all. 
"> A network is no good without users

That's exactly right!!!!! That's why you should support larger blocks! Geezus. Don't you see it? You can't see what has been happening? Look. I'm getting tired of this back and forth. I'm not really trying to convince you to support BCH because I know that's futile. People set in their ways are set in their ways. Fine. As you say, each camp got what it wanted, to try their own version of the right way forward. The market will do the rest. I'm cool with that. I just hate for people to have the wrong opinion/information on something if I see it and think I can show them something of benefit. So, this is the last point I'll make (besides saying, no, Nick Szabo is def not Satoshi - and also 2X was a solution ultimately nobody wanted/needed as it was a hedge, something between Maxwell and Gavin, the smallest increase v. an unlimited size, but that's not good enough as the two camps really needed to consolidate as they have between tiny blocks(Core) and huge blocks(BCH) - so that's the factual likely logic why Garzik, Voorhees etc called it off which makes sense, plus the fact Garzik has ALWAYS said he didn't want to be a lead Bitcoin Dev (you were around long enough that you should know that..) ) and the last point is LOOK at how much marketshare BTC is losing to alts! Bitcoin was once 95% of the market! Altcoins were a joke! Okay, so some altcoins might have offered cool experimental things of value like anonymity features etc, and Bitcoin dropped a bit and hovered right above 50% of marketshare. That remained for the longest time. Then as the scalability debate worsened and no block size increase occurred what happened? We saw Bitcoin's marketshare PLUMMET even quicker. I think at one point BTC was in danger of going below 30%. Now it has bounced back a bit, but is still in the 30% range because things take time as I said above, but even you shouldn't be able to ignore the fact that 50 is a lower number than 95 and 30 is lower number than 50...? So in closing I totally agree with you:  A network is no good without users. Best of luck."
