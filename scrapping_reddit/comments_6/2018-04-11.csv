They talk about this in the article. The blockchain would scale, but the sheer logistics of verifying the transactions and storing the blockchain would become impractical even considering a 1000x increase in computer power and storage capabilities in the next 10 years. The only reason it's survived so long is because it is hardly used. The current infrastructure couldn't even handle 0.1% of all online transactions.

What happened to the Bitcoin Cash marketing fund? I'd like to see this idea of spending in a cartoon video. Buy A + B, Spend B, Buy C, Spend C, Buy D, Spend D....  Eventually, A's purchasing power grows over time. Especially if B, C and D go to new adopters, all doing the same. Easy concept, but a cartoon, like the old weusecoins video would do it.

"Has anyone here ever heard of gresham's law?

Greshams law basically states ""bad money drives out good"". Meaning when two types of currency/money are used in circulation the bad money is naturally spent first and the good money is kept/saved/hoarded.

This is a natural phenomenon that has been happening again and again throughout history. From gold coins vs copper coins in ancient Rome, to the pre 1960s silver penny vs the post 1960s nickel plated penny.

There is nothing wrong with wanting to spend fiat and hoard bitcoin until fiat is no longer in circulation. This is a very natural phenomenon that cannot be avoided. Especially now with banks and countries around the world restricting crypto purchases on a massive scale by way of blockading exchanges or outright banning it. You cannot expect people to spend their crypto in the hopes they can buy it back.

Bitcoin, no matter how good it is at making payments will still continue to be hoarded until fiat is no longer in circulation. Gresham's law in action. No amount of screaming will ever change this.

Just something to ponder.."

"> except bch tries to maximize it's use of the word bitcoin and minimize it for btc and in many unscrupulous ways. 

As I said in my other response, I haven’t seen this happening. Perhaps due to my own bias. I can only speak for myself when I say I only shorten Bitcoin Core to Core for brevity and I do the same thing for Cash.

> when you think about it, why didn't it just start a new coin like LTC using the same software? 

The answer to this is simple but requires a knowledge of Bitcoin history, which you clearly don’t posess. Bitcoin is a community. A subset of the Bitcoin community determined that the Bitcoin Core developers had “gone rogue” or at the very least were not acting in the best interests of the community as a whole. If you know the history of Bitcoin, you know that it has always been commonly accepted in the Bitcoin community that in the event of rogue developers or miners, the response would be a hard fork.

The Bitcoin Cash community still considers itself part of the Bitcoin community. We’re not Litecoiners. We’re not Ethers. We’re not alt-coiners. We’re Bitcoiners. We always have been, and we still are.

Bitcoin Cash is not “something new” here to capitalize on the Bitcoin brand. Bitcoin Cash IS Bitcoin. It’s developed by Bitcoiners, for Bitcoiners, and for the entire world.

Incidentally, the idea that forking away from rogue developers or miners is one of the reasons I support the idea of Bitcoin Core changing the PoW. If the Bitcoin Core community honestly believe the miners have gone rogue, they absolutely should fork. I think they’re wrong. I don’t think the miners have gone rogue. But I won’t try to dissuade Core from forking. Of course, if they do fork, the beneficiary of that fork will be Bitcoin Cash. All those billions of dollars invested in mining infrastructure aren’t just going to give up and go away.

Won’t happen though. Bitcoin Core’s only claim to being the “one true Bitcoin” is that the fork they did was a “soft” fork maintaining backwards compatibility (a lie, but commonly accepted within the Core community) and that they have the majority of hash-power. They’re not going to give that up.
"
"> Bitcoin core is not a fork. It has always maintained it's own path. It didn't change direction or codebase. BCH forked and split into a different direction. It is an offshoot of btc.

The only thing true about this statement is that BCH is a fork of BTC. Nobody denies that.

However, BTC today is also a fork of the original BTC, in more ways than one. For starters, the original Bitcoin codebase was maintained by a completely different team. The current developers forced out the original team, changed the name of the project (from Bitcoin to Bitcoin Core), and dramatically altered the roadmap. The original roadmap was all about the blockchain, including scaling. The Bitcoin Core developers are the ones who decided to de-prioritize the blockchain itself and decided development should focus on “layer two” technologies. None of this was part of the original Bitcoin.

That’s just the strategic changes that have been made. But on August 24th, the protocol itself was forked when Segwit activated. From that date forward, all full nodes (and by full I mean including mining not just validating) are required by a change in the consensus rules to upgrade and validate Segwit differently than before. Failure to upgrade and acknowledge Segwit will result in getting kicked off the network by other miners and validating nodes. That’s the textbook definition of a fork. You can call it soft or hard, but a fork by any other name is still a fork.
 
> Obviously btc is synonymous with the coin

I said Bitcoin Core is synonymous with the coin. It’s also synonymous with the ticker (BTC).
 
> This is why no real company can claim the name ""coke different"" or ""coke blue"" or whatever. 

There are many “coke forks”. Coke, Coke Classic, Coke Zero, Diet Coke, Caffeine-Free Coke, Caffein-Free Diet Coke, Cherry Coke, Vanilla Coke, Lemon Coke, some version of Coke that uses cane sugar that comes in a green can. There is no legal concern here because the Coca-Cola company owns all the Coke brand and all the fork brands too.

The Bitcoin brand has no owner, except maybe Satoshi Nakamoto, and he has yet to weigh in on the branding debate. You might also make the argument that the brand belongs to the Bitcoin community. In that case, remember that the Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Core communities are each subsets of the larger Bitcoin community. The thought leaders of each community were all thought leaders of the community long before the split. Those of us on the Bitcoin Cash side ALL consider ourselves Bitcoin supporters, regardless of our opinions of Bitcoin Core. And we do not appreciate attempts from the Bitcoin Core community to take that away from us.
 
> BCH tries to minimize using the word bitcoin when referring to btc and maximize the word when referencing bch. 

If that’s the case, I haven’t noticed it. Speaking only for myself, I only refer to Bitcoin Core as Core for the sake of brevity. I do the same for Bitcoin Cash. I never refer to either coin as bcore or bcash, and I’ve only ever seen the Cash supporters do that in retaliation against a troll screaming “bcash btrash” at the top of his lungs.
 
> To be clear, I don't mind both sharing the name but it should be seperate and clear to the market. 

If you sincerely want to be clear, you should refer to BTC as Bitcoin Core. “Bitcoin” should be used only when referring to the community at large or the Bitcoin family of coins. Bitcoin Cash supporters will often state that “Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin”. We never state that “Bitcoin is only Bitcoin Cash”, and we always clarify which Bitcoin we’re talking about when there’s any room for doubt. I have NEVER seen someone use only the name “Bitcoin” when referrring specifically to Bitcoin Cash. Only Bitcoin Core supporters are so arrogant.
 
> be clear that it is now and forever more a different, distinct and separate product.

We are very clear on that. We don’t want to be confused with Bitcoin Core as we consider it an inferior product.
 
> ""You're advocating censorship?"" 

You indicated you were in favor of silencing the “Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin” narrative. Given that this narrative is a widely held opinion within the Bitcoin Cash community, and even extends outside of the community, then you are in favor of silencing a significant group. That’s textbook censorship.
 
> I'm advocating truth and honesty not ""fake news."" 

So be honest. Bitcoin Core has a new team of developers. Bitcoin Core has diverged from the original Bitcoin roadmap. Bitcoin Core has gone through an irreversible fork. Bitcoin Core is a distinct coin. Just because Bitcoin Core has the majority of miners and users does not make it the original Bitcoin.

There’s another way to look at this. “History is written by the victors”. We are still very much entrenched in a conflict that doesn’t yet have a clear winner. The Bitcoin Core camp have their narrative. The Bitcoin Cash camp has theirs. Until one side concedes to the other (or is wiped out), each side has its own version of the truth.
 
> There is a difference. There is a reason websites get taken away when they don't belong to the real world business. 

This doesn’t actually happen arbitrarily. If you want proof of this, look no further than nissan.com. What does happen is companies get into civil disputes, go to court, and let the legal system sort it out. When a “rightful owner” is established, that entity gets the domain. And usually there will be some court ordered payment of fair market value.
 
> Being first to take the website name or twitter or any social media doesn't mean it was first to use the name in the real world.

Bitcoin Core were not the first to use the Bitcoin brand. The @bitcoin twitter handle was registered in 2011, long before the current Bitcoin Core developers took over the project and renamed it. If Twitter is going to seize the handle, who do they give it to? Who is the rightful owner of the Bitcoin brand? Who gets to decide?
 
> It's deceptive to take the name and pretend to be the real bitcoin currency and disparage it for the benefit of an alt coin. 

You keep coming back to this complete falsehood that someone “took the name”. The same person who has always controlled the @bitoin twitter account is still in control. He just disagrees with the Bitcoin Core narrative. It’s as simple as that.
 
> I --am-- advocating seizure so the rightful owners of the twitter handle get the name that should belong and does belong to them. 

Ok. What individual is the rightful owner of the Bitcoin brand? You can’t exactly turn a twitter handle over to a community. Do you turn it over to known fraud and censor Theymos? His right-hand man Bashco? Greg Maxwell? Luke Dashjr? Blockstream? Satoshi Nakamoto is the only individual who has a valid claim on the brand, and the only individual who has a valid claim on the handle. Conceivably you could turn it over to the ONE PERSON Satoshi named as his successor. That would be Gavin Andreson. And guess what. He supports Bitcoin Cash.
Who knows, maybe it’s Gavin Andreson that already owns the handle. According to Roger Ver (and I’m not stating this as fact, only hearsay), the person who owns the @bitcoin Twitter handle has been an active participant in the Bitcoin community since 2009, went away for awhile, and is once again active and (quite obviously) a Bitcoin Cash supporter. That sounds an awful lot like Gavin Andreson.
 
> According to your words, since it wasn't purchased, the person the handle was seized from deserves no money as compensation for him having the handle and then it getting seized.

Would you mind quoting those words? Doesn’t sound at all like something I would have said.
 
>It's analogous to you going in public and saying your a cop to intimidate people.

No. It’s analogous to actually being a cop and telling you you’re breaking the law when you jaywalk. He’s a Bitcoin supporter. He’s just not a Bitcoin Core supporter. He’s calling out the Bitcoin Core community for being full of crap. He’s calling out the Bitcoin Core community for having diverged from the original roadmap and then falsely claiming they are the “one true Bitcoin”.
