Never really heard that, I'm 4 years, other much much longer than that. I do also keep my brokerage with them so they aren't feeling too used and I only take out the max amount. They literally end up crediting 20-100 bucks every month. Fidelity and StateFarm also have the same deal and the exact same amazing rates (tried them all at the same time). So if it did go away I have backup plans, which of course don't include BTC, lol.
"No, but anything can be justified if necessary for defense of ones people and culture. To eradicate a foreign enemy that has reduced your own people to penury and is slowly and insidiously destroying your culture. 

It’s really all about who the enemy is and what they’re doing. People don’t understand the egregiously sneaky and underhanded means that Jews resorted to in undermining the German nation and culture. 

The propaganda myth that Hitler simply hypnotized a whole nation with baseless lies about Jews is laughable. Would Americans want to expel all Catholics for zero reason?  No. There was a reason. There was a reason every single one of the hundreds and hundreds of times Jews have been expelled from European countries throughout history. "
"On paper, Fidelity has a 1% foreign transaction fees. In practice, they apparently don't charge it for ATM withdrawals. But if you ask them, they claim they do charge it. lol. 

State Farm is a nice option. But they denied me for too many Chex inquiries. :( I should have called them to reconsider. I do buy their insurance. So maybe I could have bargained. 

TD premier checking is also an option. It's unlikely they'll nerf the free international ATM deal since they require a $2,500 minimum balance to keep the account fee free."

where can i read more about how segwit could be a trojan horse?
He wasn't saying use bank instead of Bitcoin. He was saying use another (better) bank instead.
CSW never claimed to be the voice of Satoshi, just the main part of Satoshi. He claims he had a lot of writing help, mainly from Dave Kleiman. Check out the papers they have co-authored.
"Yet another example of Core's lack of understanding of basic economics:

>[Freicoin] is an alt chain with the design goal that holders of the coin will have negative interest rates, as a means to increase the velocity of money by reducing the incentive to save. Fees are taken for holding coins and distributed to miners.

>The design of Freicoin specifies that during the initial money creation period (approximately 3 years), 80% of the generated Freicoins are to be distributed by the Freicoin Foundation via donations and only 20% are awarded to miners. This differs significantly from Bitcoin, in which 100% of issued Bitcoins are awarded to miners. At the time of writing this, the exact methods and procedures describing how the Freicoin Foundation would direct its donations, were not available yet.

"r/bitcoin silently removed my posts and they censor almost everything resulting in an awkward subreddit where you should be very careful what you say.
And don't you dare even **mentioning** an altcoin. That's just how I experience r/bitcoin"
"Segwit can segregate witness data and people won't need to download it 'if they don't want to verify the chain'. So, if people are not validating their own data then how do they know a bad actor isn't manipulating the blockchain and inserting invalid transactions?

This is a pretty powerful tool for some hackers, much smarter than me, to manipulate to try and pull off some heists.

The whole point of the blockchain is to not need to trust a third party. Why do you think this is worth the minimal improvements in fixing transaction id malleability which is not an issue as long as you don't track transactions simply by their ID (which was shown to be a bad idea in 2014).

But core is connected to Blockstream AXA who are connected to the big banks.

So let's put two and two together.

Big banks want...

Bitcoin to establish Segwit where people 'trust' third parties to validate transactions for them to 'save bandwidth'. 

Bitcoin to be too expensive to spend 'on chain' (settlement layer lol) so you are forced to....use lightning networks run by centralized banks who have absolute control over any transactions that go through it...

Do you think bankers want a decentralized system of money that has a limited number of coins and all transactions can be publicly accounted for? 

Or do you think the miners are just super greedy and they want to get rich off doing exactly what Bitcoin designed them to do? 

Also, whenever anyone had an idea that diverged with Bitcoin's original strategy they were forced to create a new coin. 

But core/AXA decided to abolish the white paper and change Bitcoin into a very very VERY different coin with a VERY different function, and got away with it by censorship and propaganda.

Trust who you will."
"The Bitcoin whitepaper defines Bitcoin as a chain of digital signatures. The ability to produce a signature for a given output is what makes it so people can't just steal bitcoins without gaining access to the private key. Segwit coins rely on a kludge called ""Anyone Can Spend,"" and they are only secure on BTC under the assumption that everyone else is running segwit-compatible software as well (which is currently true). 

If someone made a fork of Bitcoin that removed Segwit, all coins stored in segwit addresses could be spent by any miner who wanted to, even though they don't have the private key. "
"Seems reasonable. The poor arent fucking with bitcoin, in the slightest. By any metric.

"Remitly usually has the best rates for India. Not sure how the rates compare for the Philippines. You can check it out. 

Also the crypto to fiat exchange rates are consistently higher in India. For example, on https://ethexindia.com/, the current rate is 24,200 INR (372.16 USD) per ETH. But you can buy ETH for 360 USD in the US. So you might end up getting a better value. Things may change in the future though. "
"He's one of the main developers of Bitcoin Core. Many people in this subreddit feel that Bitcoin Core hijacked the Bitcoin project and are trying to turn it into a high-fee network for ""settlement transactions"" ([which they openly admit is what they are trying to do](https://www.docdroid.net/NG1sbVq/pantera-march-2017.pdf)). That resulted in a splinter faction creating a fork of BTC called Bitcoin Cash, which is trying to be [peer to peer electronic cash](https://bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf)."
"I keep hearing that but about Fidelity but I can confirm personally that the rates on all 3 cards were exactly what they should have been.  You know what's weird is, State Farm denied me too for ChexSystems but I called, or somehow they issued it anyway, it was weird, almost like it was an error. I ended up getting it. So try again and then def call, the denial might not even be real.

Now USAA they definitely charge the 1%."
"*cunts

Just say it."
For now they are, but the second cryptocurrency technology becomes scalable and widespread, should a coin get corrupted it will be easy to move to a new one. Bitcoin becomes slow and unusable? Well, shit Bitcoin but I need my money today and I don't want to pay high fees so I'll be using something else thanks. That's the whole idea of decentralisation. It can't be contained anymore, centralised entities don't need to be relied on, thus they don't have concentrated power. People really really *REALLY* underestimate how much this is going to change everything. Andreas has a great talk about a kooky individual in 19th century san fran cisco who decided to make his own money because he disagreed with how the US fed was conducting itself, his kook-bucks actually gained some traction and began to be accepted at stores as part of a social rebellion against the US fed policies. You could literally tank an entire economic system by refusing to engage in commerce using its money. This type of money boycott will be so much easier in the future thanks to crypto. Atomic swaps for instance.

If by Bitcoin you mean both sides of the fork, yes. They can control one side but we can just fork away. We can even *provisionally* fork away as an insurance policy, like with Bitcoin Cash, as a way to ensure Bitcoin slips more and more out of their grasp the more they tighten their grip.
AXA, for starters. 
I think at this point bitcoin is too young to disrupt banking and finance on a level to create real wages. I don’t think any bitcoin owner wants that until later when the price is closer to the hopefully realized fantasy of 6figures. Which means fund money will be in. Funds have power and a voice that will help battle banks. Right now if bitcoin were to go toe to toe with banks and the fed it would lose in my opinion. My bitcoin knowledge is small but growing, however that doesn’t change that we know the US and every other financial system are rigged and outsiders better have real power and leverage to go toe to toe.

"In September 2015 (yes it's been going on that long), the head moderator of r/bitcoin put a sticky saying he was going to censor all posts that disagree with him on the direction of Bitcoin development. The censorship there is not a secret or conspiracy, he explicitly said it's his policy. He famously said that even if 90% of all users disagreed with him, he'd still do it.

At the time r/bitcoin was the only bitcoin subreddit and arguably the most important communication channel for the community. There was a huge backlash among engaged users and r/btc was eventually born, but most casual or new users have no idea what's going on.

For more than 2 years now r/bitcoin has been a highly censored propaganda machine for one narrow view and is not at all representative of the community at large.

This not only split the community, sowed distrust and bad blood, it also continues to mislead the massive influx of new users who have no idea that r/bitcoin is a propaganda machine and who just take it all at face value.

Part of the reason bitcoin has precipitously lost market share in the cryptocurrency space this year is because of these kinds of bad actors in the bitcoin space. Tons of talented devs and major businesses have simply left bitcoin and are now working on other cryptocurrency projects."

"As a member of the other sub, the post was probably deleted because they don't like people calling for BCH ""Bitcoin"". It confuses a lot of people, and leads to them investing in BCH instead of Bitcoin. If it was titled something like ""Bitcoin cash could be a viable alternative to BTC because it helps the poor more, people probably wouldn't have cared""

We're also pissed because Craig Wright basically went on a transaction spree, increasing traffic to BCH for about four days and driving down the price of BTC relative to BCH. As soon as he stopped, BCH crashed and BTC popped right back up to a new ATH. A lot of people panicked though and sold when it dropped below $5000, which meant his BS cost a lot of people a lot of money. There is literally a video on there of a guy who lost *everything* by investing in BCH because Wright's BS maneuver made him thing BCH was about to skyrocket and he wanted to be on the train.

What it will be used for doesn't really matter in the short term - it needs to get its hooks in and grab the financial world by its balls for it to succeed as a store of value and global payment mechanism.

Our company www.sci.ph is different, though. We now support only Bitcoin, but will soon support Ether, LTC, XRP, and even allow our BTC holders to access their Bitcoin Cash. Our business aims to be as agnostic as possible. We wont discriminate and will provide services based on demand. We are using cryptocurrencies primarily as a transfer mechanism, so Bitcoin at $200 and Bitcoin at $8000 is the same thing for us. We use it to settle our business transactions, and end users don't even need to understand it.

I actually know some people from the Core team and they are the most competent group of people in the crypt industry hands down. I believe that 18 months is not a long time for this kind of undertaking - you cannot rush this. We have built simple apps for our services and those things take months and months to test, and are still a work in progress. Imagine Bitcoin, where $120B in value relies on your code to be bulletproof? The recent incompetence shown by Segwit2x and the untested nature of the BCash software and development team does not exactly inspire confidence. "

Its so awesome how it forces you to keep it because it is too expensive and slow to move, just like Satoshi wanted
But all that investment money was just made up out of thin air too!

Dude, that's 19 cent too much if it wasn't for blockstream !
There can only be one.
I've been playing with the transaction fee setting at the Blockchain and Electrum wallets. Just to see what happens. Was surprised to see transactions with cheapskate fees getting through quite fast at times. But other times it took almost 24 hours.
"$0.20 just to exchange some cash P2P is ""totally reasonable"" to you."
Source? You linked this post
Sorry, grandma has to run a cryptocurrency hub to use Lightning? That's completely impractical.
And then 18 more! But hey no worries, just pay the fee and you only need to wait 20 hours !
It think it's also dead with Cash as well since all BCH cares about is taking that Bitcoin name and taking down BTC. Bitcoin and Cash is all about speculation and striking it rich.
*It's alive and kicking with LTC

No I'm here for more altruistic reasons. A faster transfer of value, betterment of lives through blockchain tech. Sadly, this greedy Bitcoin and Cash drama doesn't help it, and certainly, the outdated Bitcoin technology isn't the answer.
i didn't say otherwise, my comment is merely meant to point out that speaking about fees in USD is a little bit problematic since fees will always be sat/byte and will always rise if the USD price of BTC rises...
Do you run a node?
"Please explain why?

But also note that not ""most people"" come here. At the time of writing this, /r/bitcoin has ~13k online users while /r/btc only has ~3k. I know this is only at this moment in time, but I often check both subs. Furthermore /r/btc still only has about a fifth of total subscribers /r/bitcoin has.

Not taking sides, just posting numbers and asking a question."

If you prefer paying far more for transfers and having bankers dictate your technical direction you go right ahead and stick to bitcoin core. I'm not going to stop you.
hence more control of the currency, lul.
Woosh
"Why I mention it is because it's silly to bitch and complain about transaction fees when 99%+ of every penny you spend daily has a higher fee attached to it :P  

So sorry, but until people get that through their thick skull, crypto won't take off as much as it should. The thing keeping it down is ignorance by people thinking it costs too much to use, so instead of using it, they use fiat which in reality, is much more costly to use. 

So yeah, you kinda SHOULD compare the two because the two are actually competing for the entire planet's population. 

Not to insult you cause I believe you're smart as hell simply by being here, but to dismiss the comparison is to me, ignorant. "
It's horrific and truly shameful what the time and the people did to the original idea of satoshi.

"So? Even if that was true, who cares? It's about the code, the economics, the libertarian principles.

Your facts don't show that at all. It shows they would be fun to hang with.
"By one central group? 
Please check who mines the bch blocks at 

https://blockchair.com/bitcoin-cash/blocks

All blocks are being mined by different pools. Care to elaborate why you spread fud about it being mined by one central group?"
"I'm not the majority of mining, and I'm not part of any majority, but my mining power is mining on one of the pools you think is in control. I can move my mining hash power any time.  

Then there is the reality, Bitcoin mining is secured by financial incentives, and +51% of miners will never have an incentive to change the rules in a way that would degrade the value of money. 

If you think limiting transaction capacity gives money value you may feel threatened that the majority of BCH miners myself included believe the opposite and respect the fact that there is no empirical justification to limit the transaction capacity on chain at this scale.  "
Wrong lol
Nothing wrong with that either. But many of us have loftier ideas and intend to see them through.
You didn't answer my question, what is Bcash? I've never heard of it.
"> Lol.

Hi Lolly. 
Bitcoin is - per definition - a Peer-To-Peer Electronic Cash System.
Bcore is a settlement system and therefore not Bitcoin anymore. "
No, this is the name we chose. Bcash copied it's name from their future fork of Zcash.
"Could be both. I’m referring to this paper.

https://luke.dashjr.org/tmp/science/GEOCENTRIC_ANSWERS.doc"
"> BCash on the other hand has scum all over its creation.

I don't know what this means."
Okay now you are just stupid. theymos is working with the Corecoin devs. He is cancer to the Bitcoin community.
You say you didn't do that and then again use the wrong term bcash... Idiot.
"https://blockchain.info/blocks
Same shit "
It is because of fact checking that you are downvoted.
Except all the evidence there publically on the blockchain says otherwise. Why spread FUD that is so easily seen as lies?
"Yeah that sounds like a well informed neutral opinion. Thank you for your input.

I especially like the ""if you don't agree you're jealous"" attitude. Brings me back to my school years, thanks for the nostalgia!"
Difference is we come up with FACTS to educate people. Facts that get removed in rbitcoin.
How are we jealous? I use BTC weekly and have done for 5 or so years. I am disappointed, not jealous.
"Yea, I don't even run my own node now since it takes so fucking long and costs so fucking much to move my coins to/from the exchange. I'm a bad person who just leaves the coins at Coinbase now. However, since I'm so nervous about it, I means I end up buying way less than I would like and dumping earlier than I like.

The fees have really killed Bitcoin for me. I was 100% HODL before (except for things I bought with BTC directly)."

"You're not making any point... You're still simply showing that most of the mining is being completed by Ver, Wu & Co entities.

For example: BTC.com is owned by Bitmain. (go through to the about section).

BCH is a centrally mined cryptocurrency."
Have fun being a Blockstream cockholster
I can articulate why cobra bitcoin and theymos are bad for bitcoin. If you're just going to throw around words like scum you're not going to change minds. How about actually providing an argument instead of insults?
😂
"Do you even look at the info? No mining centralisation at all.

Corecoin on the other hand isn't just centralised under the Core devs. They even want further centralisation b y using off chain scaling using LN. You can not have decentralisation with LN. By definition it is  a set of centralised payment hubs."
"You do realize that by using bitcoins name it hurts bcash more?

It will always be the step child people look down on because of that choice.

Have fun with your insult wallet!"
It's also a base element that will survive whatever mankind cooks up.  Crypto will mostly lock up if there's ever a war with nukes or EMPs.
Are you not embarrassed writing that? Are you so blind you can't see the problem with it?
Gold always has transportation, and most importantly, storage costs
[deleted]
The mining doesn't matter because we can check and validate the work and transactions. I don't know what your point is. 
Calling it 'bcash' huh? Nice objective opinion you've got on the matter there.
Right now fees are comparatively low actually. But twice I paid over $10 in fees last week. Right now a dollar or under will do. Still high, not absurd though.
You can exchange gold without losing any of the value, in person. Your gold token will never become more expensive to exchange than it is worth, which has happened to over 50% of UTXO's now.
The difference is that gold can be used to make many different things which gives it intrinsic value.  
Except actual gold has a ten thousand year track record and will survive WW3.
Gold has properties that will make sure it's always in demand. That won't necessary be the case with bitcoin as with gold there is no metal that can replace it, with bitcoin this is different. If bitcoin looses network effect and usability it will be a  store of value because it's a  store of value. That goes very well in dreams, not so in real life. Bitcoin prices are powered by  belief, now that's the same as anything in life that people invests in. But at some point there has to be something a bit more tangible then a dream for a dream to stay a dream.  But maybe core can  expend on the religious nature of Bitcoin. You know, us vs them. Kill the infidel coin. That kind of stuff. Might work for a while. 
Nothing to do with fiat. Fiat is legally enforced debt. I owe people thousands each month in fiat to survive. That gives it tremendous value until I can start paying for everything with cryptocurrency. 
Fiat has real value because you have to pay your taxes in fiat or you go to jail.  It's value is a more complicated get out of jail card.
Hyperinflation after hyperinflation through centuries
"No it doesn't, it's clogged up, the blocks are full and the fees are far too high and it will get worse.

LN is based on taking transactions off chain, but to make sure your coins aren't stolen you still have to be able to make on-chain transactions. If Bitcoin continues to grow these kind of transactions will get far too expensive for an individual to pay.

For example: Someone steals 10$ from you, you want to get your coins back but the fee is 20$ for an on-chain transaction (That also has to clear in 24 hours or you lose your claim!). You either waste money or you can't do anything but take the loss.

Now imagine if Bitcoin use goes through the roof, LN is still based on the blockchain, so fees may get extremely high, think 100-1000$ per on-chain transaction, which only companies and large LN hubs can afford. We're back to a system similar to current banks.

This whole system is doomed.

For LN to work (Without fucking everyone over) you still need cheap on-chain transactions :-/"
Thanks for your reply. I especially like the part where you make a constructive comme.... Oh wait
Ok, I guess my point is that if this post that you linked got upvoted enough, it would be deleted. It only got 21 upvotes.
I'm just here to spectate on his childish tit-for-tat fight between Core and Cash over hedge-fund money. It's primarily for entertainment purposes.
So does other crypto with better technology. Btc bch fight is just a greedy fight for the bitcoin name and grandpa's retirement funds.

"But you don't lose all credibility using the name of another project that you forked from?

Its Bcash, never will be bitcoin. 


"
Only a little bit, because I see that the technology they are developing and implementing is from a realistic standpoint, far better that what BTC or BCH has to offer. Ripple is actually improving the system and making people's lives better, not squabbling like BTC/BCH.
Thanks! Great summary.
"Agreed!!!

But complaining about fees is NOT the way to do it. If anything, it detracts from the purpose because people will be reluctant to invest and use crypto.... which means their money will be in fiat, not crypto :)"

">But I'll give you a hint, if you want more people to believe your side and if you really think you have the moral high ground, maybe calling other people names, assigning carpet negative terms, and generally acting like a child isn't the best way to get people to believe you right?

"Miners: Antpool, Viabtc, Bitcoin.com and a bunch of ????

My point stands."
"Point noted. I disagree with your opinion but I appreciate the level headed response. 

The fact remains that the OP link is very alarming. I don't think people should blindingly downvote something that they haven't checked."
Mining definitely matters, in fact it's probably one of the most important aspects of a decentralized cryptocurrency. If most your mining is being operated / controlled by a few, then your currency isn't decentralized. BCH is being mined mostly by Ver, Wu & Co (i.e. Antpool, ViaBTC, Bitcoin.com, et al)

We don't want Litecoin nor Bitcoin segwit. We want a fully functioning Bitcoin, we want to realise Satoshis dream, which currently holds the name BITCOIN Cash.
Yeah and last time I tried to buy something with BTC (Steam game) I waited close to 24 hours despite a fee of around 2€. Fuck core and their damn 1 MB blocks. You can't build a second system like lightning onto it without the base system still working flawlessly.
Quote him some Satoshi or a link to nakamotoinstitute.org and see what happens. 
"yeah 2016 was one hell of a tough year for bitcoin. Good thing 2017 has been an absolute blessing for bitcoin with the current transaction fees and backlog and lets not forget the glorious failure of segwit 2x

source:
https://blockchain.info/unconfirmed-transactions

also Litecoin is a viable alternative in my experience too ;)"
That's why we need peer-to-peer like lightning. 
LOL
"For low fees people should use bcash.
I am currently using bcash for daily transaction & i am loving bcash because of its low fees."
"We already have Segwit which is confirming 10sat/byte fees in 1-2 blocks. Any transaction over $8 has a lower fee with BTC than any credit card. Transactions under $8 costs a couple cents more with BTC. 
  
>All the poor are only ever paying fees  
  
Our current payment system has higher fees, and they're paid by the merchants, not the people. Be smart and use SegWit, stop using wallets that force 500+ sat/byte fees. The idea that you HAVE to pay $10 in fees every time you want to send BTC is FUD."
Anyone shopping with Bitcoin right now doesn’t understand Bitcoin. If you want to buy coffee, use the balance on your Starbucks app. I’m not knocking the alt coin Bcash, I’m just saying maybe you should read Satoshi’s white paper again.
"btc is the new gold. have fun with your coins though (:

You should be happy about it "
And bitcoin is 8000 while bch is crashing. No one cares about the poor ur dreams got hijacked and used to scamm ppl of real money pyramidal.
How do you guys reconcile that the only reason fees are high is because of the repeated spam attacks? Jihan, Ver, et al are purposely sabotaging the Bitcoin network to shill their altcoin that exists solely to let them keep using ASIC Boost.
I feel the need to remind everyone of the memo from the bitcoin cash disorganisation CEO.
If you think couple dollars is expensive then buy and use BCH bro. All you broke ppl out there complain so much about the fees but don’t do anything about it. No ones asking you to use bitcoin 
"I only use btc as a store of value. 

There are far superior day to day cryptos. 

This is not to say that btc will not solve that problem, hence why I still hold, that and it's the best return investment you can get with a long term track record. No other crypto has this track record of stability and growth in a chaotic market.

Suggestion, just hodl btc and use Ltc to transact. "
[deleted]
"I was helping someone send bcash to dump on an exchange today for btc and the tx fees with bcash were 1.48 usd for standard and 0.99 cents usd for slow economy priority. This cannot compete with a credit card that gives the clients cash back.

Lightning payment channels solution might solve this problem but onchain cannot"
"Eh, beats the hell out of the $100+ in interest you'll get charged by your credit card for that same transaction over the life of paying off that balance.

Vendors get charged usually a MINIMUM of 2.45% for credit card / debit card transactions... so again, these are peanuts in fees. because vendors usually build those fees into prices to offset it if it becomes enough of a burden for them."
Funny thing, after Bcash fell from 2800 to  below a thousand, I️ didn’t hear much about it for a few days. Apparently the fan boys are back at it again!
Hey another idiot finding it's not all that practical to settle your coffee purchase across a global decentralized ledger. Shocking!

Converting BTC to LTC requires an onchain transaction, so you're still fucked.

All the originals vision for Bitcoin is dead. Now it's just a speculative vehicle for greedy people who wants to strike it rich.

Sure, you can do like it’s hovering, but thats not the damn Hoverboard, we know and the same is this.

"> Welcome to the new normal. You'll soon get people telling you how Bitcoin was never meant to be a peer to peer currency and your transaction isn't worthy of being on the ledger.

"A mainstream news article I read recently described it best.

>And if you believe bitcoin might one day become a “long-term store of value, like gold or silver,” it is nothing short of preposterous to claim it as such at this stage. It has only existed for a few years, and it is one of the most volatile financial assets in the world."
"Ok, so. Im not part of either Bitcoin community but I understand how bitcoins block chain works (though I don't understand the deferred ledger thing that caused the fork)

But it seems to me that bitcoins protocol as it's designed could not support the world's transactions. The blockchain is already large and that is from relatively niche use. If it was used for mainstream transactions and the protocol modified so it had enough bandwidth for said transactions. The blockchain would get fuuuuuck off huge. And it would grow every day.

It would hardly be egalitarian if mining required multi millions in investment to get into it. While I think /r/Bitcoin going full censorship is pathetic and dishonest, I agree with them in that small time transactions just can't really be the future, can it? I would expect it to cost a great deal to get a transaction on a global public ledger. Particularly one that is verified by monstrous computing power.

I'm not current on the state of the debate here and I'm open to having my mind changed on this. 

One other thing I'd mention is that visa costs an average of 2.10 per transaction, and cash through logistical overhead costs vendors 0.30. Bitcoin I think ebs and flows at the whims of the market, and I can't imagine transaction costs getting larger than visas for this reason. "

"Yep. I used to read /r/bitcoin to inform myself when I was new to the experience. Dissent and criticism were common and (at one point) addressed respectfully and intelligently. Now, asking the wrong question or having the wrong attitude results in a ban from the /r/bitcoin nobility and a canned response like ""FUD"" or ""hodl"" from the meme-breathing rabble. As Bitcoin attracts more and more mainstream investment, people who just want the growth and don't care about the project dominate the community, and /r/bitcoin more and more resembles the sports bar of the crypto world."

"I understand the skepticism, but I went to all those links in the post, and it actually made me solidify my stance in favor of BitCoin Cash. That post is just a major ad hominem attack, nothing against the protocol itself.

And call me crazy, but shouldn’t it actually be a *good* thing to know that the thought leaders are in favor of BitCoin Cash over BitCoin Classic? Gavin, Vitalik, Roger, Craig Wright (whether he is fake or real Satoshi), John McAfee (even if he is a crazy guy). Whether you hate or love all those people, they are simply supporters of BitCoin Cash over BitCoin, not developers of it. So it’s not being “run” by them, and even if it were, I don’t think that’s a bad thing. 

At this point, r/bitcoin is looking like a bunch of people with sunk cost fallacy, which is kinda sad if you think about it. A bunch of people who probably became millionaires virtually overnight, and they don’t know how to sustain their wealth without constantly going on the defensive.

"A list of naughty things could be written about anyone.  Bitcoin Cash is not Roger, Jihan, or any single individual.  It is about fixing a problem that Core is actively choosing not to fix.

But the militant refusal to do so, is telling.  As is the ***deletion of threads saying Bitcoin is for the poor.

There are plenty of people involved in Bitcoin Cash that have major influence over it who have a squeaky clean record and reputation, but you opt not to focus on them, because it doesn't suit your agenda.  I don't care about individuals. I care about saving Bitcoin.  And whether Core.... Bitcoin Cash.... or Bitcoin XXXX ..... gets us there, does not matter to me.  Bitcoin is software.  Its Math.

Seriously read the LN spec yourself independently without allowing yourself to be influenced by others. Then ask yourself how likely it is that such a system will become a viable general payments layer (and not just a micropayment system). 
LN isn't peer-to-peer. It's peer-to-hub-to-peer. Nobody is able to afford to open channels with each counterparty, hubs would get immense power

But you have lighting that has already been working flawless in testing now and everyone and their Grandma can run their own hub and set fees as low as they want,  So things are looking good for the fee market.

You're being downvoted but if people just took a look...

In reality, I believe that BTC and BCH are just two sides of the same coin: they are coins that were created to PnD each other. Major holders in BCH make a move, pump BCH price, BTC flows into BCH, BCH pumps even more, Major BCH holder sell off to buy a lower BTC price, BCH price falls, buyback into BCH, rinse and repeat."

This is a pretty funny thread, let's list a lot of people and tell bad things about them. Even if every single thing that is written there is true (which isn't the case) the most important thing is the technology itself, not personalities.
"Your understanding is mostly correct but you're falling for the idea that there isn't still a lot of space to scale on chain. Sure the blockchain will get bigger and it will require more power to mine, but in time the cost of harddrive space and computing power goes down so as long as we scale intelligently there is still a lot of room to grow.

Most people don't have a problem with side chains, most people have an issue with limiting the blocksize in order to push people to side chains. That's why 8mb + segwit and other solutions have been talked about a lot, but unfortunately certain players will not move forward unless they have 100% of the voice on how to proceed and this means squashing things like segwit 2x which was seen as a compromise."
"Mining like almost any industry naturally evolves to require large capital investments. That was predicted from the [very beginning](http://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/emails/cryptography/2/) by Satoshi, was always part of the plan, investors knew what they were signing on for.

Bitcoin can and will scale to millions of transactions per second.

">I agree with them in that small time transactions just can't really be the future, can it? I would expect it to cost a great deal to get a transaction on a global public ledger. Particularly one that is verified by monstrous computing power.

Miners are also paid from the system itself. Personally I think it was a mistake to limit the number of Bitcoins and have miners get paid only from fees eventually, but that is another discussion.

At 8MB blocks, which is a little less than 8x the Bitcoin blocksize, the chain only grows 4TB every 10 years. Very affordable, but you have to remember that rBitcoin saying that everyone needs to run their own node is a meme and that Satoshi envisioned nodes only being on server farms eventually anyway."
"It’s not a Store of value either. Right now it’s value is still all hype and speculation.

"> It seems to me that people conflate two very different forms of price deflation: debt deflation (less money chasing the same amount of goods) and deflation caused by economic growth (the same amount of money chasing more goods). The latter, by definition, isn't terrible for economies.

You can measure monetary deflation separately from price deflation. I've never seen a case where significant contraction in the supply of money didn't cause a recession. In either case price deflation also seems to be pretty bad for economies (or bad economies lead to price deflation).

The most successful economies in the world tend to have a moderate amount of inflation. Japan is notable as one of the only nations with consistent deflation and their economic growth has been stagnant for nearly 30 years, in fact their GDP per capita is lower than it was 30 years ago.

>By this logic, you don't have any incentive to spend your inflationary currency on anything other than buying the deflationary currency.

How is that the logic?

People already have inflationary currency and access to deflationary assets, we don't have to speculate on what they would do with it. The whole point is that saving and spending are two different things. Money doesn't need to be a good ""store of value"" because money has no value except for helping exchange value. Money under a matress for 20 years is not generating value regardless of whether the money supply is inflating or deflating.

People use money for consumption, not savings. When people want to save they use money to buy things that appreciate like property or stocks.

A currency that people don't want to spend and just hoard isn't a good currency, its a deflationary asset, of which there are already many that have lots of other uses.

There is a strange, unexamined circular logic behind bitcoin proponents that says all the problems with bitcoins adoption as a functional currency because it was never intended to be a currency and its narrow minded to think that's all bitcoin can be. Then when asked to justify why its actually valuable, and why what we're seeing isn't just a spiral of speculators looking to profit from increasing price rises caused by , then it suddenly becomes a currency again, even though all the arguments for why bitcoin isn't a good currency were dismissed with ""well yeah its not meant to be a currency"".

>It seems to me that the idea that Bitcoin should be a currency today is the error. Currency requires currentness. Currentness requires that it be generally accepted. It is way, way too early to expect that. Great (now-4-year-old) comment expanding on this point here

That argument doesn't address the points I'm making about why inflationary currencies displace deflationary ones. It simply asserts that we don't have to worry about bitcoin not being a currency now because it will be a currency in future, and that somehow with enough speculation it will somehow transform into a functional currency, and that all its value is coming from unrealized future value as a currency, not simply speculation on a deflationary asset.

It does no work to prove this, and the 5 supposed ""pre-requisites"" that bitcoin will need to become a useful currency all apply to previous speculative bubbles in deflationary assets that never turned into a currency. Deflationary assets don't turn into currencies just because they hit a certain market cap.
"
"> You can have inflation of the supply without moving around relative value. For example like with a stock split. If everyones shares are split in two, everyone still owns the same amount of value its just diluted into a larger number of shares.

Theoretically, sure, you could imagine increasing the nominal supply of money in such a way that the newly-created money is distributed to existing holders in exact proportion to their current holdings.  Basically, have everyone take out all the paper currency they have and, at the exact same moment, add a '0' on the end -- so a $1 bill would become a $10, and a $5 would become a $50, etc.  And similarly, everyone's bank account balances would get multiplied by ten. If this plan were announced way in advance such that all contracts could take its effects into account when they were being drafted, then you could have nominal price inflation without affecting anyone's purchasing power.  But that's obviously not how new money is created and distributed in the real world.  https://wiki.mises.org/wiki/Richard_Cantillon#Cantillon_effects

>aside from ignoring the real world evidence that monetary deflation is terrible for economies

It seems to me that people conflate two very different forms of price deflation: debt deflation (less money chasing the same amount of goods) and deflation caused by economic growth (the same amount of money chasing more goods). The latter, by definition, isn't terrible for economies.  

>and the very immediate evidence that deflation is killing bitcoins use as currency

I don't see that at all. It seems to me that the idea that Bitcoin should be a currency today is the error. Currency requires currentness.  Currentness requires that it be generally accepted. It is way, way too early to expect that.  Great (now-4-year-old) comment expanding on this point [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mb27q/bitcoins_vast_overvaluation_appears_caused_by/cc7i6y8/)

>If you have access to both deflationary and inflationary currency you never have any incentive to spend deflationary currency over the inflationary one.

By this logic, you don't have any incentive to spend your inflationary currency on anything other than buying the deflationary currency.  

>This is why we don't have any deflationary currencies anymore. It's why the entire world got off the gold standard. 

I don't think so. It seems to me that gold's fatal flaw as a currency was its high transactional friction which necessitated reliance on ""second-layer solutions"" aka banking. The gold *standard* failed because the temptation of a central backer to issue more IOUs than they had gold to back it up is always going to prove irresistible, leading inevitably to default.

>All the pro-deflationist arguments still apply to gold but gold will never be a currency again because no one wants to spend it when you can spend other things that don't increase in value.

No, gold will never be a currency again because of its massive transactional inefficiency.

>Currency doesn't need to be a store of value. 

I disagree.  I think that historically currencies could get away with being relatively poor stores of value because they didn't face competition from something like crypto. But that's obviously changed.

"> Your only reason for being here is to troll

No, not true. I enjoy this sub, and the tone seems to be reaching to be informative and intelligent. I respect that. I simply disagree with the attitude you guys have towards BTC (and your subreddit name is highly ironic, in that regard, but I don't see this community laughing at that irony). It's important for us to be supporting the ENTIRE ecosystem, where no harm is being done to actively undermine other cryptos. I see many cases where BCH has been used as a tool to undermine BTC, for not reason other than to elevate BCH. Basic tribalism. 

I don't care who ""wins"", that's why you calling me a troll is tiresome. I want the internet of ideas to win. I want the IDEA of exchanging all the values of humanity (including all varieties of financials) over a global, digital framework to succeed, and succeed boldly. I don't like the petty fights between these two subreddits (and they are petty, very petty). There is so much more at stake in this ecosystem than the damn block size, can't you guys see that? This shit will undermine world governments...we should be more united. Division only helps the powerful collect more of what they know they can game out of us. "
">And pulling bitcoin transactions off chain into centralized, for profit, single point of failure lightning hubs, does the exact same fucking thing. Centralizes bitcoin. 

Simply untrue: LN will be a layer 2 protocol. All the security and decentralization of bitcoin (BTC) remains. Block size is intrinsic to bitcoin itself: the runaway effect of focusing on the block size will inevitably lead to centralization (because how many computers on this planet, now or in 10 years, can process block sizes of 1GB, which is what would be needed to allow fast, easy, and cheap transactions for millions of users, every day).

Bitcoin isn't a religion, by the way. I don't need to wake up: I just need to invest and continue to learn. I hope you do the same, because this cultish view of ANY crypto is just bizarre as hell. It's the IDEA of cryptocurrencies that will change the world, not the technical details that /r/btc and /r/bitcoin have been psychotically fighting for months on end, now. It needs to stop, starting with folks like yourself. I wish you well.  "
">No, it doesn't, but given the context (BTC first mover advantage and name acceptance is reflected by its &lt;50% of the market market cap) I don't see how it can be argued that BCH is in an advantageous position AT THIS MOMENT. 

They are not comparable, apple and orange.

Store of value against the original roadmap.

BCH is still useful even with a small market cap but BTC is supposed to be a store of value, so if its value drop below BCH Its only value proportion will be dead."
"No, it doesn't, but given the context (BTC first mover advantage and name acceptance is reflected by its <50% of the market market cap) I don't see how it can be argued that BCH is in an advantageous position AT THIS MOMENT. 

That may change, or it may not, but until BCH is as recognizable a name as BTC it's the underdog, and one metric for measuring that is market cap."
It's true. You think there's no possibility that price can return to that peak level because you ascribe the entire move to a manipulated pump and dump. You're an idiot. 
Victory? False claims now? Your still not willing to acknowledge that the spinning top candle might be merely a simple pullback from a too fast run up that self corrected. You're a clown. 
"You are the one struggling. Goal post moved to personal attacks now :D

Lol, you're a legend in your own mind. What's with you devs? 
"Nice Straw man you got there bro.

The price will eventually reach 2800 again but it will take longer. And there will be more pump and dumps in the future that will take it higher as well.

I mean seriously, you have been destroyed this entire time. Why are you still bothering to talk to me? Is it because I'm ""A game developer"" hahaha"
Nice argument you have there bro. 
*yawn*
"> one from fake manipulation as you're implying and the other from real demand

800 to 2800 back to 1200 is not real demand.

800 to 1200 sure that can happen. 800 to 2800 no fucking way. Zero chance that was organic."
Facepalm. Your problem is that there are two reasons to explain the moves, one from fake manipulation as you're implying and the other from real demand. Somehow you think you know it's the first and in saying you have no way of knowing which. Certainly you're a dev with the typical hubris, no doubt. 
"The action in and of itself implies motive. If I punch someone I am committing an act where you can assume I had mal intent. 

That's the problem with your points so far. I don't even fully believe you are arguing in good faith."
Are you dense? How many times do I have to explain my argument? You're the one claiming to know motive behind the price moves, hence your description of them as manipulated pump and dumps and or fake buy walls. Describe how you think you know so. 
"Actually you are the one that has yet to really say anything that shows how there was no motive. Also we know Roger Ver has an agenda.

Explain your damn argument please."
