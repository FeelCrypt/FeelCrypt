Never really heard that, I'm 4 years, other much much longer than that. I do also keep my brokerage with them so they aren't feeling too used and I only take out the max amount. They literally end up crediting 20-100 bucks every month. Fidelity and StateFarm also have the same deal and the exact same amazing rates (tried them all at the same time). So if it did go away I have backup plans, which of course don't include BTC, lol.
"No, but anything can be justified if necessary for defense of ones people and culture. To eradicate a foreign enemy that has reduced your own people to penury and is slowly and insidiously destroying your culture. 

It’s really all about who the enemy is and what they’re doing. People don’t understand the egregiously sneaky and underhanded means that Jews resorted to in undermining the German nation and culture. 

The propaganda myth that Hitler simply hypnotized a whole nation with baseless lies about Jews is laughable. Would Americans want to expel all Catholics for zero reason?  No. There was a reason. There was a reason every single one of the hundreds and hundreds of times Jews have been expelled from European countries throughout history. "
"On paper, Fidelity has a 1% foreign transaction fees. In practice, they apparently don't charge it for ATM withdrawals. But if you ask them, they claim they do charge it. lol. 

State Farm is a nice option. But they denied me for too many Chex inquiries. :( I should have called them to reconsider. I do buy their insurance. So maybe I could have bargained. 

TD premier checking is also an option. It's unlikely they'll nerf the free international ATM deal since they require a $2,500 minimum balance to keep the account fee free."

where can i read more about how segwit could be a trojan horse?
He wasn't saying use bank instead of Bitcoin. He was saying use another (better) bank instead.
CSW never claimed to be the voice of Satoshi, just the main part of Satoshi. He claims he had a lot of writing help, mainly from Dave Kleiman. Check out the papers they have co-authored.
"Yet another example of Core's lack of understanding of basic economics:

>[Freicoin] is an alt chain with the design goal that holders of the coin will have negative interest rates, as a means to increase the velocity of money by reducing the incentive to save. Fees are taken for holding coins and distributed to miners.

>The design of Freicoin specifies that during the initial money creation period (approximately 3 years), 80% of the generated Freicoins are to be distributed by the Freicoin Foundation via donations and only 20% are awarded to miners. This differs significantly from Bitcoin, in which 100% of issued Bitcoins are awarded to miners. At the time of writing this, the exact methods and procedures describing how the Freicoin Foundation would direct its donations, were not available yet.

I don't necessarily agree with your premise, but this is an informative comment.
What is the purpose of a non mining node? Also, how many nodes do you think should be on the network?
"r/bitcoin silently removed my posts and they censor almost everything resulting in an awkward subreddit where you should be very careful what you say.
And don't you dare even **mentioning** an altcoin. That's just how I experience r/bitcoin"
"Segwit can segregate witness data and people won't need to download it 'if they don't want to verify the chain'. So, if people are not validating their own data then how do they know a bad actor isn't manipulating the blockchain and inserting invalid transactions?

This is a pretty powerful tool for some hackers, much smarter than me, to manipulate to try and pull off some heists.

The whole point of the blockchain is to not need to trust a third party. Why do you think this is worth the minimal improvements in fixing transaction id malleability which is not an issue as long as you don't track transactions simply by their ID (which was shown to be a bad idea in 2014).

But core is connected to Blockstream AXA who are connected to the big banks.

So let's put two and two together.

Big banks want...

Bitcoin to establish Segwit where people 'trust' third parties to validate transactions for them to 'save bandwidth'. 

Bitcoin to be too expensive to spend 'on chain' (settlement layer lol) so you are forced to....use lightning networks run by centralized banks who have absolute control over any transactions that go through it...

Do you think bankers want a decentralized system of money that has a limited number of coins and all transactions can be publicly accounted for? 

Or do you think the miners are just super greedy and they want to get rich off doing exactly what Bitcoin designed them to do? 

Also, whenever anyone had an idea that diverged with Bitcoin's original strategy they were forced to create a new coin. 

But core/AXA decided to abolish the white paper and change Bitcoin into a very very VERY different coin with a VERY different function, and got away with it by censorship and propaganda.

Trust who you will."
"The Bitcoin whitepaper defines Bitcoin as a chain of digital signatures. The ability to produce a signature for a given output is what makes it so people can't just steal bitcoins without gaining access to the private key. Segwit coins rely on a kludge called ""Anyone Can Spend,"" and they are only secure on BTC under the assumption that everyone else is running segwit-compatible software as well (which is currently true). 

If someone made a fork of Bitcoin that removed Segwit, all coins stored in segwit addresses could be spent by any miner who wanted to, even though they don't have the private key. "
"Seems reasonable. The poor arent fucking with bitcoin, in the slightest. By any metric.

Its a speculative investment bubble for people with disposable income. Dress it up however."

"Remitly usually has the best rates for India. Not sure how the rates compare for the Philippines. You can check it out. 

Also the crypto to fiat exchange rates are consistently higher in India. For example, on https://ethexindia.com/, the current rate is 24,200 INR (372.16 USD) per ETH. But you can buy ETH for 360 USD in the US. So you might end up getting a better value. Things may change in the future though. "
"He's one of the main developers of Bitcoin Core. Many people in this subreddit feel that Bitcoin Core hijacked the Bitcoin project and are trying to turn it into a high-fee network for ""settlement transactions"" ([which they openly admit is what they are trying to do](https://www.docdroid.net/NG1sbVq/pantera-march-2017.pdf)). That resulted in a splinter faction creating a fork of BTC called Bitcoin Cash, which is trying to be [peer to peer electronic cash](https://bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf)."
"I keep hearing that but about Fidelity but I can confirm personally that the rates on all 3 cards were exactly what they should have been.  You know what's weird is, State Farm denied me too for ChexSystems but I called, or somehow they issued it anyway, it was weird, almost like it was an error. I ended up getting it. So try again and then def call, the denial might not even be real.

Now USAA they definitely charge the 1%."
"*cunts

Just say it."
For now they are, but the second cryptocurrency technology becomes scalable and widespread, should a coin get corrupted it will be easy to move to a new one. Bitcoin becomes slow and unusable? Well, shit Bitcoin but I need my money today and I don't want to pay high fees so I'll be using something else thanks. That's the whole idea of decentralisation. It can't be contained anymore, centralised entities don't need to be relied on, thus they don't have concentrated power. People really really *REALLY* underestimate how much this is going to change everything. Andreas has a great talk about a kooky individual in 19th century san fran cisco who decided to make his own money because he disagreed with how the US fed was conducting itself, his kook-bucks actually gained some traction and began to be accepted at stores as part of a social rebellion against the US fed policies. You could literally tank an entire economic system by refusing to engage in commerce using its money. This type of money boycott will be so much easier in the future thanks to crypto. Atomic swaps for instance.

Can you explain why the extra quote about pacifists is relevant to rbitcoin?

The point wasn't that Bitcoin is for the poor and to hell with the wealthy. The point is that the wealthy aren't anywhere near as impacted by lack of methods to move money around as the poor are. The poor & unbanked of have a lot more utility to gain from bitcoin (cash) than the wealthy do.

If by Bitcoin you mean both sides of the fork, yes. They can control one side but we can just fork away. We can even *provisionally* fork away as an insurance policy, like with Bitcoin Cash, as a way to ensure Bitcoin slips more and more out of their grasp the more they tighten their grip.
AXA, for starters. 
I think at this point bitcoin is too young to disrupt banking and finance on a level to create real wages. I don’t think any bitcoin owner wants that until later when the price is closer to the hopefully realized fantasy of 6figures. Which means fund money will be in. Funds have power and a voice that will help battle banks. Right now if bitcoin were to go toe to toe with banks and the fed it would lose in my opinion. My bitcoin knowledge is small but growing, however that doesn’t change that we know the US and every other financial system are rigged and outsiders better have real power and leverage to go toe to toe.

"In September 2015 (yes it's been going on that long), the head moderator of r/bitcoin put a sticky saying he was going to censor all posts that disagree with him on the direction of Bitcoin development. The censorship there is not a secret or conspiracy, he explicitly said it's his policy. He famously said that even if 90% of all users disagreed with him, he'd still do it.

At the time r/bitcoin was the only bitcoin subreddit and arguably the most important communication channel for the community. There was a huge backlash among engaged users and r/btc was eventually born, but most casual or new users have no idea what's going on.

For more than 2 years now r/bitcoin has been a highly censored propaganda machine for one narrow view and is not at all representative of the community at large.

This not only split the community, sowed distrust and bad blood, it also continues to mislead the massive influx of new users who have no idea that r/bitcoin is a propaganda machine and who just take it all at face value.

Part of the reason bitcoin has precipitously lost market share in the cryptocurrency space this year is because of these kinds of bad actors in the bitcoin space. Tons of talented devs and major businesses have simply left bitcoin and are now working on other cryptocurrency projects."
