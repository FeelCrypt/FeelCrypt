That's fucking insane. I totally agree with you. 
Mmh I know what it is in minecraft but I'm not sure this is what they're talking about 
"> How much?

From one channel (costing around 2-4 onchain txes), you can get almost limitless transfers, afair the upper bound is: infinite in 1-directional channel,


and for bidir chan (you can both spend money, and as well earn money, all without touching the chain at all) limit is either also infinite, or:  number of times the direction changes must be <= blocks in the set channel lifetime, e.g.: around 3000 direction changes (so e.g. 3000 txes in worst case) for 30 day long channel."
oh that's easy you just email the keys to the buyer:)
lol yeah right
Sorry, just added sarcasm tag. I'm Canadian, not Venezuelan.  I've heard they're going to use altcoins, yes. 
"Haha bunch of idiots who are buying the wrong bitcoin!

lmao"
I'm truly sorry for their loss. 
I suppose we'll be waiting around another 3-5+ years for this fairy tale solution.
send a fucking raven
I can never remember to use the hamburger crypto when I buy food or the fuel crypto when I buy gasoline.  One time I accidentally sent the mid-term-store-of-value coin when I meant to send the long-term-store-of-value coin   Wouldn't it be easier to just have peer to peer cash? 
I don't want to transfer back and forth with one person only. And I don't want to use liquidity providers.
"> bitcoin is the ""gold standard"" of cryptos

It is supposed to be ""digital"" gold.

Like digital music: the same thing that was on your physical CD, only it can be transported instantly anywhere and exchanged for free.

That's what makes it both ""gold"" and ""cash."""
Fascinating! How do you know that?

Guy using this tech, yesterday: https://twitter.com/simonebronzini/status/900545862690107392

Disclosure: it was not a full LN yet, that is, he could pay to/from just this one ""merchant"" for the price of few on-chain transactions he could send thousands to this guy.

For another merchant he would open another channel.

This works today (needs polish of course, I expect adoption in 2018). That's why had no worries dumping BCH, there are better solutions to scaling."
have a look at /r/bitcoincash too
Because the price was 0 that whole year, there were no merchants accepting it then, and fewer than a couple thousand people worldwide had even heard of Bitcoin. You're 100% full of shit.

Your timeline and story is a complete lie. You did not discover bitcoin in 2009 and onboard merchants.
Gongrats on frontpage /u/increaseblocks I know you post a lot of content on /r/btc so it's nice to see.
How much?
Txs are not feature for a store, get it :)
Ok I'll see myself out. /r/NEO master race!

">  which will be permissioned. 

This is not true.   It's trustless and permissionless by design, at the protocol level.  Go read LN and BOLS specs.
"
"How many people are entitled to open/close channels, if they want to open and close a channel each month?

Because that limit still exists... :("
how do you know it would be 1500 tx and what can i do with it then?
This sub is like /r/the_donald of bitcoin :/
On top of that, the protocol aims to average 1 page every 10 minutes so if the pages are too small, only a few transactions can get through 
I'm a NEO shill myself... good job on that hardware wallet :)
"> You can do billions worth of transactions on Paypal.

PayPal can steal (""freeze"" forever) your money, Lighting Network can not
(and you choose the worst case scenario how long money will be frozen if other party would stop cooperating).

Also I like holding and then spending Bitcoin, as it's undervalued and will grow in value long term, compared to fiat.

> unless you are a large firm/private entity providing liquidity for opening payment channels then it helps 

Some dudes just opened a channel for few bucks.

Is this the new FUD that Roger Ver ordered from his birds? (birds.bitcoin.com - payed propaganda services) - that the LN is only for large corps?

Here dude pays bucks: https://twitter.com/simonebronzini/status/900545862690107392

Also note at the end that idiot who complains ""you need twitter to use LN"" - like he can't understand you can send the TX over anything, even give it on USB (no need to publish it into network before it's time to redeem back - it's 100% secure).






"
Good thing you have your own altcoin bcash with empty blocks! 
ETH ftw
"> Bitcoin is, regardless of branch, running on borrowed time due to the technical limitations in its protocol imho.

No other coin actually has it figured out. Monero has privacy but won't scale. Ethereum will not scale if people ever use it for its intended purpose. Dash might scale better but is very sketchy in architecture. Etc."
sorry to hear, so venezuelans will switch to bitcoin cash then
let the memes flow!
+10 iota
It absolutely is digital gold... There is fuck all to spend crypto on. 95% of people are here to make more $s. Deal with it. 
Fun fact, a dramatic decrease in the liquidity of a currency will cause its value to drop.
How many tx's per second can you imagine on-chain will handle? How big will  the block be if say 2000 tx's need to be handled within one second?
"I'm just throwing numbers out of my ass. Some core shills are actually excited to see $1000 fees in the near future, though.... 😒🔫

What can you do then? You can look at your wallet balances and shed a tear. "
thanks!
Thx!
"Venezuelans seem to disagree
https://coin.dance/volume/localbitcoins/VEF"
its the gold standard, not everyday transactions
Is there a reason Monero won't scale? Hadn't heard that before.
"Yeah um... Something was up with that link. ""Ski4Free It will just cost you your life."" Which I thought was a joke. It doesn't look like anything happened but, I'm scanning my comp ATM for Virus/Malware anyway..."
Now Bitcoin Cash needs to be implemented by shops, payment providers and so on.
"This whole post reminds me of people who get mad when you say ""xmas"" instead of ""Christmas"" because it's taking the word Christ out of it. Lol insecure much?"
Bitcoin Segwit or Bitcoin Cash?
"I could argue you were the one unwilling to compromise... That's the problem with coming to an agreement, no matter what you can always rationalize your position and say the other position is unreasonable.  I applaud you for moving on with something you believe in, i really do. Even though I don't agree with your positions and I think these other implementations are bad for bitcoin (atm) you still do far more for this space than most. However, you have to see the other side of things. What you (and others) saw as reasonable, most of the core devs didn't. That's what happened.. this whole debate in a nutshell.. 

This isn't the first disagreement, it won't be the last. The easy thing (for our emotional little brains)  is to brand everyone else as unreasonable, or too stubborn.. most of the time, everyone is to blame, and in that, in a shared humility, you have to try to find common ground. 

Again, I appreciate your work and I hope you don't think I'm being unfair to your position. Best of luck."

How many years did that take?

"Twitter ""throttles"" tweets by ""known bad actors"" (anyone Twitter themselves deems ""controversial""). It's not censorship, per say, since all the tweets still exist on the person's profile, but it's definitely controlling communication."
"""hashcash (used in Bitcoin mining)"" is still clearly a lie as well

> To implement a distributed timestamp server on a peer-to-peer basis, we will need to use a proof-of-work
system **similar to** Adam Back's Hashcash

Hashcash is not used in bitcoin mining. Bitcoin is not hashcash extended with inflation control.
"
"It's tragic, really. Some few of us here are old enough to remember when Dr. Back was the *enfant terrible*, who rendered the RSA algorithm in three lines of PERL that could be printed on a t-shirt or tattooed onto an arm, thereby enabling the export of military-grade munitions, as hard encryption was classified in the early 1990s.

It seems that he's been trying to regain the glory of his youth ever since.

Hashcash was universally rejected, he had no part in the creation of eCash, and now this most recent pathetic spectacle with Blockstream and his merry band of misfits.

He insists on acting up like a B-list actress who refuses to acknowledge that she is not as captivating as she was in her heyday, rather than comporting himself as the elder statesman of our industry that he *should* have been."
Over 3 years: https://web.archive.org/web/20140325194946/https://twitter.com/adam3us
Thats the one
Agreed.
"Correct.

Hashcash was not even invented by Adam Back, but two academic researchers Dwork and Naor. Adam just created an implementation of it about 5 years later to use with email that ultimately went nowhere, so his claims to have ""invented"" hashcash are 100% a lie too. Bitcoin was unleashed about 12 years after Adam's version of Hashcash.

Bitcoin doesn't use Hashcash at all, just the idea of Proof of Work that Hashcash introduced which Adam Back had nothing at to do with.

The man is a fucking leech who can only ape the work of others and has not done one single relevant thing his entire ""career"""
Ouch!
That's a fucking ridiculous amount of time to lie
He's pretty good at propaganda though, maybe not good enough however.
he used that stupendous lie as his personal tagline for so long that he completely destroyed any credibility he had, in my opinion
It got so bad that even Princeton University couldn't help themselves by mocking him. It just goes to show you how screwed up these BSCore guys are. 
source? I'd love to see that
I can't say here.
He's a guy who made t-shirts as a publicity stunt, and specializes in sticking his nose in everybody else's business.
Yes Past cypherpunk, you actually have to be one to be one.
"Adam: ""details details"". "
It's even more obvious and simple than this. No CP would ever accept $76M in fiat funding from banks. 
"I would like to point out. That Adam thought bitcoin wasn't going anywhere and wanted nothing to do with it for years in the begging. Many of us have been in bitcoin longer than he has. He can sing any tune he wants now. But the only connection it has to him is that hashcash inspired only one part of cryptocurrency. There was gaping holes in it's use, satoshi solved the riddle via use of a blockchain and game theory with the miners.

that's it : u/adam3us is not a cypherpunk , just a lousy president \ individual \ president \ ceo of a company with an improbable business plan .
