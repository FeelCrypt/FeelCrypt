This is good for bitcoin.
Its ok. I think i will just use bitstamp once they verify me
sorry for my late answer. But true, they dont have USD. If you really need that then its not for you. Hope you find the perfect one for you :)
I’ll add a mirthful laugh. Nice username 
Coming from a user named SegWitFailed it’s clear you’re talking from experience hahahaha
Peak 15% adoption, currently at 8% adoption. Even core's own in house wallet doesn't use segwit. Do you have something to add?
Thanks mate
Da fuq has this reddit come to?
i don't think it actually is
Oh man I love to see this stuff

"I’m the delusional one? Sure, you could do the same type of off chain tipping with regular bitcoin, the difference is that you could never transfer your tips to your own wallet because of the fees. I mean even if I collected $10 in tips I wouldn’t actually get to spend any of that bitcoin....

I have posted a lot in both the bitcoin and btc subreddit. I have received a lot of tips of bitcoin cash but I never even really seen bitcoin tips happen for anyone, and it’s obvious why...

Tips in regular bitcoin would just be a reminder of how it’s failing as a currency. No one tips “a store of value”"
Thanks Santa!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Merry Christmas!  u/tippr $5  The fun and innovation are back, now that we promise cheap fees and ample block space.  This really *can* grow, despite the uncertainty the Grinch has been creating.
"I would almost take offense to that, but it is great to be needed, just the same!  Who doesn't want Santa as a hero?  Really?  He can have better gadgets than James Bond (he has an entire workforce of elves, after all, that can make anything).  He can get anywhere in an instant (just like Bitcoin Cash).  And he knows if people are naughty or nice, so it takes the guesswork out of it.

So, personally, I think I would make an incredible hero.  Except when I need a nap.

u/tippr $5 Merry Christmas!

"A magic robotic elf called tippr listens across Reddit for mentions of his name.  He figures out the amount and transfers the amount of Bitcoin Cash from the sender to the recipient.  The tips can be transferred to a Bitcoin Cash wallet or tipped to other Reddit users as you've noticed here.

u/tippr $5

"Santa thinks so, but that's my opinion.  Read, search, ask.  Most people on r/btc are very helpful.

edit: Woops!  Forgot something! u/tippr $5  Merry Christmas!"
"Even Santa has lost track.  There were some very nice people sending me tips as I was sending them out, so it is hard to tell.  I am going to guess that there will be a post on r/btc in the next day or two from the author of the tippr bot.

I spent several hours using r/random and looking for people giving good Christmas wishes.  This has been great fun!

Merry Christmas!  u/tippr $5  Exactly!  Grow awareness.  I visited many subreddits tonight and tipped some of the top posters that had Christmas messages.  Many of them have already responded quite favorably.  This has been fun and rewarding for me, as well!

Santa will work on delivering a BCH exchange.  There are many elves trying to build services for Bitcoin Cash, so hopefully they will deliver soon."
Sure!  u/tippr $5 Merry Christmas!

"Santa is magic, so why shouldn't he use magic internet money?  Na... actually tippr is a bot that tracks balances and transfers of tips between Reddit users.

u/tippr $5

That tells it to move $5 worth of Bitcoin Cash from Santa's tip jar to yours.  Now you can tip others on most Reddit forums (there are a few Grinch's still out there).  Check r/tippr for information and assistance, or ask about Bitcoin Cash in r/btc

Merry Christmas!  "
Thanks!  And a very Merry Christmas!  u/tippr $5
Santa thanks you for the kind words!  Merry Christmas!  u/tippr $5
Merry Christmas!  u/tippr $5  The spirit of Christmas is alive and well!
"Yes, they've killed off so many incredible uses for Bitcoin by creating the fee market and limited space.  Just incredible how they have hurt this space. An effort like this helps to make people aware of Bitcoin Cash, and that it is not the same as Bitcoin.  And that Bitcoin Cash has uses and capabilities most people were not aware of.

If we can make this distinction clearer for normal people (not into crypto), then if Bitcoin eventually crashes, it won't take everyone else down with it.

Merry Christmas!  u/tippr $5"
Santa is giving out Bitcoin Cash. u/tippr $5  Merry Christmas!
"don't know about the others, but i am by myself, just inspired by their kindness. gave away $200 already today, mostly to hot girls in a NSFW subreddit. I suppose I'm the bad Santa (best Christmas movie of all time, btw). Loading up more now!

 tippr and BCH and santas are awesome!"
"It certainly should not hurt adoption.  Even if many don't ever move it, they own some BCH how.  That puts it in their mind, and when they hear about Bitcoin Cash, hopefully they will remember that they have a little stashed away.

HO! HO! HO!"
Magic!  Merry Christmas! u/tippr $5
Whoa, that's awesome. Thank you!
Finally it worked, I did not see I had a space in between the dollar sign and the zero, that is why it failed twice.

Merry Christmas you wonderful person. I'm not asking for anything but just want to wish a giving person a Merry Christmas! 
Merry Christmas! I actually need a couple bucks in bch, so if I get some, that'd be amazing!
You don’t have to tip me. I’m just here to say Merry Christmas for everyone. And BCH +1000 kudos for you. You are doing an awesome job! Very inspiring. I wish I could do the same, maybe next year when my 0,5 bch will have a greater value 👍🍻

"I can tell you for certain that it *is* making a difference!  Many people here and in the other forums have heard about Bitcoin Cash, but never thought they would own some.  

Then when they hear the intent of the project is to help those who earn only $2 a day, it brings out the Christmas spirit.  

I've only had a few people indicate they don't like BCH, but they get a tip anyway (until we can get tippr to send lumps of coal).  They can't do this.  We can.  We will continue to be able to.

"Santa had a little Bitcoin that rose in value, and it just seems important right now to get Bitcoin Cash into people's hands.  Everyone has been hearing about Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, and now that they have a little, they have more reason to learn more about it.

This is entirely self-funded, although several wonderful helpers have contributed today.  It is great to see the r/btc community work together!  Welcome!

Merry Christmas! u/tippr $5"

Excellent!  Anyone can be a Santa and the size of the presents doesn't matter.  Merry Christmas!  Happy New Year!
"It takes much practice to be able to boil it down without getting too technical.  

Santa admires Andreas for his skills at making complex ideas understandable.  Bitcoin Cash also has Roger Ver, who is great at explaining the reasons why Bitcoin Cash has such enthusiasm: We are trying to allow every one of every income level to secure their money.  Both of them are very good at what they do.  Santa is glad they can speak well.

Start with a high level overview to get them using a wallet, sending Bitcoin Cash back and forth to each other.  That is fun and gives them initial skills. 
 When they get a glazed look, just leave it alone for awhile.  They'll approach you with questions when they are ready.  If they don't ask for a week, then invite their questions.  If they went right to the glazed look, don't worry.  Gice them a break and allow yourself to start over.  The concepts often need repeated a few times.  Get them just to what they need, without diving into the details.  It's hard to do!

I love your enthusiasm!  It is exciting to see it returning to Bitcoin in the form of Bitcoin Cash.  Keep up the good work.  

Merry Christmas!"

Merry Christmas! u/tippr $5 HO! HO! HO!
"This Santa hasn't been able to keep track, as kind people have been tipping me, too!  It has been an absolute blast to be able to make so many people happy.  It's $5, not a huge amount, but enough to be meaningful.  Many tell me this is their first crypto, and they never thought they could/would ever get some.  Now they are interested in Bitcoin Cash and have a reason to learn more.

The goal is to let everyone on the globe, even those earning just $2 each day, control their own money and to be able to transact outside their village.  Several years ago, the mPesa system in Kenya handled 43% of the country's GDP.  Over little flip-phones!  If they can do that in Kenya, Bitcoin Cash is possible, too. There is a service, bitPesa, I believe, that lets people buy mPesa with crypto!

Now you can be Santa, too!  All the tips, the big and the small, make a difference to those who receive them!  And it feels *so* good giving them, too!"
"Not the goal to get rich.  The goal is to have a global payment system with such low fees and barrier-to-entry so it can be used even by people making just $2 a day.  

The value going up is a (very) pleasant side-effect.  Santa wants to spread awareness of Bitcoin Cash and this reason for it.  Like remembering the *real* reason for Christmas has little to do with the gifts.

edit: Almost forgot u/tippr $5  Merry Christmas!  Remember the real spirit of Christmas and the real reason for Bitcoin Cash!"

A better excuse than most!  Have fun!  Search first, since many people have the same questions.  Read the responses.  Ask if you can't find the answer.  The elves in r/btc are very helpful, but even they get tired and grouchy answering the same things sometimes several times each day.
"Yes!  I spent hours visiting r/random subreddits, tipping posters of Christmas wishes.  It was great fun and attracted quite a few new people who never ever thought they would own cryptocurrency!

The best presents are often the gifts we didn't think we needed."
Wow BCH is so much faster and cheaper to spend then bitcoins. This is amazing. Merry xmas @u/BCHSanta 🎅🏻🎄

This guy is seriously awesome, I'm not asking Santa for a hand out, just hoping others will recognize!
CRAP! I think i messed it up! GDAX says i need atleast .01 bch to transfer in! Just got the tippr confirmation maybe it will go through. Oh well, Merry Christmas! This is fun. Go BCH!

This will only have value if it has a purpose.  Otherwise it's just sitting around taking up otherwise useful space, like some of the old Christmas gifts you have no use for.  Keeping them for sentimental value, but nothing more.

Excellent!  The best gifts are the ones you may not even know you wanted.  Enjoy!  Search, read, and ask.  The r/btc forum has some very helpful elves (of course, a few that misbehave, too, but elves will be elves).  Merry Christmas!
HO! HO! HO! That's funny!  Yeah, it is a fun side-effect of the ticker symbol.  Now we can bch-slap someone.  Calling them a 'big bch' seems like a good thing, eh? u/tippr $5 and a Merry Christmas!

It's great to celebrate the holiday and help Bitcoin Cash adoption.  Dropping into a subreddit at random and tipping would be treated like spam any other day.  On Christmas, everyone is more open to the random acts of kindness. HO! HO! HO!

NO NO NO. It's spend and replace! Spend and replace! Then more and more people are holding an appreciating asset. You get all the benefits of HODL without the HODLING!
No, just personal money. I was lucky with it this year, and made enough that I thought I could use it to help promote Bitcoin Cash to more people.  Christmas is a perfect time to give.  u/tippr $5  Merry Christmas!
Not bottomless, but others have been tipping me, too.  That just helps the fun keep going.  I will be taking a break for a few hours soon.  And this has been great fun and it has received some great reactions.  Who knew $5 could make someone's day?!  HO! HO! HO!

Good bot
Just as real as Bitcoin Cash!  All forms of exchange of value are a matter of trust and belief.  So, yes! u/tippr $5
"I am hoping by next Christmas we can have a more robust network of Santas. Maybe a routing network between them so they don't tip the same people.  Maybe we will add hubs.

I am going to cuddle up to Mrs Claus before I start working on that.  It might be awhile.  It's pretty cold up here at the North Pole and warm weather doesn't get here until June.

Have a great Christmas!"

[Here's a guide](https://np.reddit.com/r/tippr/wiki/reddit-usage).
Omg that was not necessary but thank you. Merry Christmas to you and yours.
Thats really nice.
Awesome!
This is so nice. Whether /u/bchsanta sees this or not, this has been shaping up to be a very special Christmas for my family. Unexpected snow on Christmas Eve, and my 3.5 year old twins really getting into it for the first time has been magical. All in for BCH!
Some people are awesome. Merry Christmas all! 
It's good to see people like this. Merry Christmas everybody 
/u/bchsanta will it cover packaging and shipping cost?
Well that's nice. Not sure how that works on Reddit still. But merry Christmas.
u/bchsanta - you deserve some Puerto Rican coquito!
"Such a fun idea...If only I had back the money that me and Katherine sent that tv preacher that was screwin the hockey players ;)
"
This is so quintessentially reddit! Kudos to the BCH santa, truly the hero we needed yet don't deserve. 
"Wow BCH keeps getting more awesome. Even with the small dips, I feel cryto has a real chance in overtaking the system. I was giving up on btc with so many altcoins having more advantages, but bch reinvigorated my hope in ""vanilla"" btc. "
Love the generosity and Christmas spirit! Merry Christmas🎉🎁!!
Wow, did I really see someone get tipped $50 in bch? That's amazing! Happy holidays everyone.
Merry Christmas and a happy 2018 - the year of Bitcoin Cash!
i'd like to receive some of that! still tippin out BCH?
Merry christmas - fantastic  to see people doing good deeds with crypto!
I love this sub so much more than /r/bitcoin 
This is an awesome post. Warms my heart on a night that has nothing but bad memories. Thank you for my renewed faith in people and their intentions :)
Santa can’t hodl onto all those cookies he collects, he has to share them with all the good boys and girls out there!
How awesome! Never actually seen someone using bchike this. 
Great job Crypto Santa.. May the coins be with us all. Merry Christmas to all of you. 
Makes me really happy to see how positive and supportive this sub is of each other
Keep spreading that holiday cheer! (:
"This sub and coin are a total eye opener. 

Merry Christmas team!! 

There’s ily one way forward. "
Wow, Merry Christmas! What a nice gesture :)
Amazing stuff! Reddit IS the internet! Best place to be Xmas Eve! Merry Xmas everyone!

That's the BCH spirit!
Oh shit! The amount of money they've given away is incredible! Best way to make someones Xmas.
he gave me, a ETHTARD a little taste Earlier, AWESOME!
Is this subreddit always this friendly :o
Merry Christmas, i hope next year will be even better for crypto world. Have fun this Christmas and be grateful for the infinite opportunities we had in this year :)
Aha this is actually really cool! I'll be fully honest, I've been checking out both communities a bunch. I have BTC and BCH. This is really really damn cool guys, wow. 
"Is this real or some prank? 
Never knew we have such awesome people in the community.

Merry xmas to everyone!"
Merry Christmas everybody! :-)
Incredible how BCH is changing the landscape of online transactions. I hope this technology is used beneficiall to aid all people, especially the people who are most in need. Happy holidays!
I have to sleep in the same bed as 4 people tonight, but nothing can stop my christmas spirit! Merry Christmas y'all!
I believe in bch and santa
This person is amazing, love people who help others. Merry Christmas to all 🎅
Merry Christmas everyone :) Just took an L recently after BTC fell, wholesome posts like these help keep the faith!
hahaha I love it
What a legend
wow, this is pretty awesome.
What about moi
I only recently got into crypto and this reminds me of the wholesomeness of  Dogecoin but with useful practicality. I love this subreddit. 
"Merry Christmas to you all! 

Please remember those who may be alone this Christmas, if you have elderly neighbours who are alone spend some time with them too, it will mean the world to them."
Do the BCH Santa 🎅 live in the north pole too 
Interesting way to get people involved with BCH
Santa comes to life 🎊
Awesome job! Merry Christmas 
This sort of stuff is a great way to promote BCH as well as spread good cheer. Merry Christmas to everyone who does a good deed over the holidays! 
Plzzzz tip me Santa :)
I’m generally very grinchy, but seeing this kind of generosity and fun completely flips my mood. It’s great to see Santa coming through.  
Yeah! BCH santa, showing gym the power of pushing the Gold Coast. Way to go!
"Happy holidays everyone!

This year has been great for bch, here’s to another great year!"
Its a Christmas miracle!!!!
Oh wow really great for this guy.. I mean Santa! He's making a lot of people's days merrier! I wish he could open an exchange to BCH, because where I'm from we don't have a choice but to go through BTC first :/ 
Can I haz come BCH too? 
"Man this is awesome.
Merry Christmas."
What is this trickory? 
This thread is the true Christmas spirit. So nice to see technology actually helping people.

If this thread is all real life, this is so uplifting to read! Such a generous way to make people feel a little bit better.
"This is beautiful.

Good way to promote Bitcoin cash 🎅
I got a part of the giving.. so much love for the reddit community for being so cool!!!
That is honestly better than being gilded, cheers to those of you giving out money and double cheers to this guy!
You guys are great, merry christmas :)

Wow, that is awesome. Warms my heart to see this on this cold, cold Christmas Eve!
Merry Christmas. 🎄  let's change the world
Thanks team BCH for spreading some love this year :D 
"Well, if I didn't believe in BCH before, I do now.

BCH Santa is awesome."
Stuff like these restores my faith in humanity. Great stuff guys. 👌👌
Can anyone explain to me what this is? Lol sorry I assume this person is donating or something?
I love bitcoincashes community. Especially around Christmas
BCHSanta is the best Santa. Merry Christmas everyone.
This is what makes this sub amazing! 
Wow /u/bchsanta such an amazing thing you are doing!!! I ran out of all my bch on tippr :( do you think you can help fill me up so I can spread the tips around too?! Merry Christmas!!! 
Wow. What an awesome thing to do. Thank you for making everyone's christmas better santa :D
Merry Christmas Santa! Rock on.
I’ve missed seeing this type of stuff. Glad there’s a tip bot again. Merry Christmas everyone!
Not the hero we wanted but the one we needed! 
Merry Christmas! Or happy holidays! Whichever you are comfortable with 
"Amazing, I’m really stoked on this whole community!!
Merry Christmas!!"
So nice to see all the holiday cheer. Merry Christmas, happy Hanukkah, or whatever it may be you celebrate. 
This is so damn cool! Been an ETH fan boy but traded some in for BCH! That tip bot is cool but how do the recipients claim it?
"I'll match any tip I get with a donation of my own, Merry Christmas! 

Cheers,"
Peace and love to all. Merry Christmas!
Pretty neat that there are folks out there like this. Merry Crimbus.
Merry Christmas and a happy new year!

"A true internet bad ass. Merry Christmas everybody!

What an awesome idea! The future seems grim at times, but then technology pops up with things like reddit and ridesharing and cryptos. Love it. Merry Christmas!

I love you Santa. Bitcoin Cash is much faster with cheaper transaction fee than Bitcoin. Merry Christmas

"This thread is like coming down the stairs and seeing all the presents under the tree. Gotta love BCH the real Bitcoin.
BTC used to be like this in the early days. 

Merry christmas! Enjoy the time with your loved ones"
Merry Christmas reddit :) 
He is? (I didn't get anything....)
So how does u/tipper work?
I am a simple man. I see nice post I upboat
What a great guy/gal spreading holiday cheer!
Been having a tough time getting this into my wallet. Instructions seem so easy, but money isn’t moving. I can get the balance check to work but not the withdrawal. 
This really makes me happy to see 
Wow that is so awesome! Merry Christmas! Glad I still believe in Santa! 
I believe!! The spirit is thriving in the thread! Merry Christmas!
This is what different between BTC and BCH - great community! Just awesome
How is this possible? I can’t even get verified to make a purchase. Thanks for doing this. Happy Christmas 
How can I set my BCH address on reddit for tippr?
Imagine if Bitcoin were Christmas presents. You'd have to wait until March to open them and then give back your presents as a transaction fee, leaving you with just the shitty wrapping paper. Now compare that to Bitcoin Cash. Merry Christmas. 
"I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

u/tippr $5 Merry Christmas to you, too!
Merry Christmas to everyone !
I haven't done any digging into bitcoin, could someone expalin how the tipping works, and how it would work with someone who doesn't have a bitcoin account?
This would have never been possible with Bitcoin without the fork of bitcoinCash, which brings the most important thing to bitcoin, not only low fees or fast tx, but shared love again and again ! 
"Well, I wish you all a happy Yule! May the coming days be brighter again.


"
Someone convince me to sell my LTC for BCH.
Huh. I was wrong about this sub. Good on him and merry Christmas to all
"can i have some too?
/u/tippr "
Yes! What an amazing idea. Ho Ho Ho!
Merry Christmas too all and all a goodnight!
"As someone just starting out in crypto, of course I joined r/bitcoin. I quickly found out that it wasn’t a place for advice or a place to learn from until I saw a post that referenced r/btc.
This subreddit opened my eyes and explained the problems I was seeing with bitcoin and introduced me to other cryptos, in particular bch.
Seeing wonderful people like this trying to create a sense of community with a wonderful altruistic spirit especially at this time of year is a joy to behold. One day I hope to be able to return the favour of all the help and advice that I’ve read and do something similar, rather then just press the orange up arrow.
Merry Christmas and happy holidays everyone!"
I love seeing this, makes me nostalgic for the pre-MtGox days when people were tipping BTC all over reddit. I remember the evangelists explaining how this great currency confirmed in minutes and was almost fee-free, and how the blocks would just be increased in size as needed. Thanks for being the cool community I remember from back then guys.
Such great Christmas cheer :D merry Christmas!
Hi Santa, the holidays are really hard for me emotionally, any chance you could help make it a little better?
Hey Santa, can I have some? Merry Christmas to all!

We gave each other physical presents too, but it was definitely fun being my family's crypto Santa this year.

This is how Christmas will be for all the good little boys and girls in the future!
You are a good, nay, great person this one. 
That’s awesome! Plus it’s bch so it won’t cost you $20 to move $5. 
This guy must be a millionaire or something
Thanks /u/bchsanta you made my husband’s year! He has been quite gloomy but you sent him some BCH and he is over the moon!
Still nice to see stuff like this.

"Here I am, 2am wrapping up the night playing Santa for my kids.  I think everything's finally ready for the morning mayhem.   Not used to Reddit crypto communities being heartwarming,  but this whole thread was a great way to wind down and end my night.  This all was cool to see. 
"
How many Santas are there in this thread? I'm very overwhelmed by how strong is the spirit of christmas and giving in this subreddit! Merry christmas!! 
This whole thread is magical.
This is amazing 
Merry Christmas to all BCH holders and spenders. I got into BTC before the fork so I didn't get any BCH for free. But Exchanged some of my BTC for BCH. 
[deleted]
"That's amazing. Always nice to see this sort of stuff in the community 🙂

Merry Christmas everyone. Cheers to a great 2018"
There is only one sub I constantly refresh on New as opposed to Hot, and it’s because of spicy posts such as this. What a great member of the sub. Happy holidays cryptofamily.
"I recently converted 100% of my BTC to Bitcoin Cash.

Now I just have to figure out how to get my bitcoin cash from when it forked.  And then I'll figure out how to setup tipper and I'll be good to go!"
Who is the real santa and who is the divergent fork santa? u/bchsanta u/ImSantaClausBCH
Hows everyone doing?  I freakin love this community!
can’t believe this! Santa is, after all, real! 🎅🏼
This tipping bot is awesome! And the people spreading the word about BCH through it too! Merry xmas everyone :)
Man I'm still trying to figure all this Bitcoin out. This guy is awesome even if I still don't get how it all works 
[deleted]
merry christmas to all and to all BCH
What about me :)
I don't have BCH yet but I think it'll be my next crypto. Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas! I'm coming from the btc community and this is just amazing to see the difference in attitudes over here. You guys are awesome :-)
What the Hell! BCH is on Santa's Good List! I love this place!!! Tis a Merry Christmas!
u/itiputipwetip too! Got my first tip from him/her! Thank you. This community is generous and doing a good job spreading knowledge and awareness.
Keep up the great work dude.
Thank you /u/bchsanta. This is why mass adoption of cryptocurrencies is inevitable.
So cool to see stuff like this!
Merry christmas from a wintery Sweden u/bchsanta and u/ImSantaClausBCH.

"And here I am waiting for verification because of backlog. Wanted to join the movement before bch gets too expensive. 

Merry Christmas to all!"
This is amazing lol
[deleted]
lol the boss hahaha
"All I want for Christmas is low transaction fees, low transaction fees;
Then I could afford to buy a coffee "
This makes my heart warm! Makes me so happy to see the legitimate and kind uses of crypto currency!! My heart to you, kind sir!
"well, seems BCHristmas time is here, happiness and cheer ;)

"This guy is awesome doing this !

Merry Christmas!!

Do you get even more from santa if you’re banned from /r/bitcoin?
"I hope santa gets some good karma for his efforts ;)

https://www.reddit.com/user/bchsanta/comments/"
How is Santa so rich I wonder? Elon Musk is that you?
So much BCH flying around in this thread! I guess you can do that when you have a low fee currency. Haha
[deleted]
"Ha, I love this sub. It's so wholesome, really considering BCH now as my first crypto to start. Glad there's people like this in the world left still. 

Thanks for being a swell person /u/bchsanta!"
This is so great. Just that little bit of holiday cheer. Not all hero’s wear capes. 
Love seeing people spreading the holiday cheer. A huge thanks to all the BCH gifters out there! Helping those in need is what crypto is all about!
Is this your way of trying to get him to give you bch
Been sort of missing home and family during the holidays. But being a part of this community is something special. Let's make Bitcoin great again! 2018!
Wow. Merry Christmas bitcoin Santa.
[deleted]
Merry Christmas 🌲🎉✨
Imagine if Bitcoin were Christmas presents. You'd have to wait until March to open them and then give back your presents as a transaction fee, leaving you with just the shitty wrapping paper. Now compare that to Bitcoin Cash. Merry Christmas. 
These guys seem really generous and cool. 
"Not gonna lie, this is pretty amazing. Been tipping with Redd coin and I might have to get some BCH to do so with this. Can I use just $?? like: ""tip $.50""?"
"/u/BchSanta gave me $5 and all I did to be a good boy was eat sushi! 

I appreciate Santoshi Nativimoto!"
Wow I don't think I'll ever see something so generous like this over at r/Bitcoin .... Way can't we have more people like this in this world.
Lol this is great!
"This is honestly one of the reasons why I started loving bitcoin cash, the community is generous and more welcoming.
I feel like a system like this would be impossible for bitcoin due to the low speed and fees. Which really shows how bitcoin cash is the true currency for everyday use."
This is what Christmas is all about. Merry Christmas guys!
This guy too: https://www.reddit.com/user/IMSANTACLAUSBCH
"I bought BTC right after the BCH fork (so didn't get any freebies) and heard from that r/bitcoin to stay away from this sub! But after BCH went live, I picked some up and have to say, for the most part this sub seems more reasonable and kind :) 

Happy Xmas ya'll.
"
Superb stuff, bchsanta tipped me $5 earlier. It's 4 minutes to Christmas and I've already had a fantastic present. Thank you so much bch Reddit santa. Making Christmas special. 
$2 /u/tippr 
Yeah, SantaClausBCH made my day!
I love how he stays in character for every comment. He really makes peoples days.
I started with nothing. Ended up with $10+ in BCH in my wallet. Thanks to all the tippers! Merry Christmas! 
I learned about this sub yesterday because a kind stranger tipped me in another sub. Since then, I've been glued to my screen reading up on cryptocurrencies and learning the benefits of Bitcoin Cash. Without that tip, I never would have found out about it.  Merry Christmas to all who are giving tips this holiday. 
"All of the ones that do this are so awesome. 
bchsanta tipped me 5$, thank you so much!"
"**TO ALL:  MERRY CHRISTMAS TO ALL!  IT'S BEEN FUN HEARING FROM SO MANY PEOPLE!**

You've given or received Bitcoin Cash tonight.  You can do with it whatever you like.  If you hold onto it, or tip it to others, or even convert it to fiat or another cryptocurrency... it is yours.  It is a gift from Santa.  

You have the opportunity, even though it is just a small amount, to do something fun with this cryptocurrency.  The r/btc community is very welcoming to those with the curiosity to ask questions.  Sometimes we hear the same questions many times a day, so please try to search for an answer before asking.

You can read the [whitepaper that started the Bitcoin phenomenon](https://bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf). It is only a few pages, and only a small portion of it gets into crazy math stuff, but the rest is very easy to read and it will give you a great understanding of the goals of the Bitcoin Cash project.
  
The goal of Bitcoin Cash is to give everyone on the planet the capability to secure their own funds, and to transact with whomever they want, whenever they want, and wherever they may be.  The technology to let this happen is here.  Now it is up to each of us to urge merchants to accept Bitcoin Cash, to use crypto if the merchant accepts it.

We're tired of credit card breaches.  We're tired of identify fraud.  There is a long list of other features we can get by using cryptocurrencies.  We've got the technology, it is just a matter of letting people learn about the future.

Thanks for coming here to thank/beg/plead.  I am sorry I can't Bitcoin Cash into everyone's hands.  But this has been an incredible start.  This Christmas, on Reddit, I've sent tips to Norway, Austria, Australia, Japan, China, and the tips have ended up in other countries I will never know.  This is a global project for everyone.  

**This technology is an incredible gift.  And Christmas is all about sharing gifts.  Thanks for letting me share my passion with you.  Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!**

P.S.  Some of the payments didn't make it through (Santa forgot to restock) so several tips (about 20) did not get delivered.  I will try to identify these and fix them over the next few days.  Sorry for the inconvenience!"
[deleted]
This subredit is amazing. Merry Christmas 
Been holding BTC since March 2013, but sold them all for BCH in Aug and never regretted it.
Yea I was testing the bot, I don't think you can choose your fees for withdrawing but Bitcoin cash is still low enough so its worth it :) 
I am afraid I was on the naughty list. But very cool to do.
Not all hero’s wear capes!
Merry Christmas everyone. Here’s to breaking records and kicking ass in 2018!
This is the best Christmas surprise I’ve ever seen.  Love this.  
What a great concept. Merry Cryptomas! 
Some people are good in the heart and are all giving, hope everyone has a great Christmas !
What a great guy. Keep it up! 
"Love to see r/bitcoin try the tip bot thing. They would have to use Litecoin heh

Happy Xmas :P"
Merry Christmas to all and I hope everyone on here receives BCH from Santa this year!
That is awesome! Good to see some people spreading the holiday spirit and in this thread too!
All the people getting tipped makes me jealous! Merry Christmas guys
Our very own Santa 🎅
lol bleak time to be a btc boi. no choice but to take on the role of Grinch.
Let’s all do this with Christmas crypto themed accounts!
"Why can't we have someone go around and tip $50 in Bitcoin core? 
Wait, oh yeah, you'd have pay another $50 in transaction fees.
"
Thanks Santa!!! How can I send him a tip to help refill his bag? /u/ImSantaClausBCH
The tippr bot is putting in the Overtime tonight!
My parents told me santa wasn’t real when I was in first grade. I think this is the closest I’ve been to believing in santa since then. 
Someone was donating 25 cents in btc to everyone who commented on his thread earlier, he was pretty great too!
Things like this make me glad to be a redditor. 
Merry Christmas everyone! glad there are good people helping others :D
You guys are a fun bunch of maniacs :)
That's pretty boss, very boss in fact
All I want for Christmas is bch!!!
Haha that is awesome. With the state of affairs In the world today, it really is awesome to see a group of people find such an awesome technology to rally around, and build a great community. Keep spreading the kindness Santa!
Wow. Awesome. I need to get on this u/tippr stuff. Im just waiting for NXT's igni's drop on the 28th and will convert it to BCH tippr
Reddit is the best, Merry Christmas everyone!
Wtf.. BCH Santa?? Wtf is going on here
"Lol 

4 for u/tippr,

You go u/tippr!"
why tho? :D
This is wonderful! Merry Christmas everyone 
Finally a Santa kids can look up to!
That's the spirit!
merry everyone!
This is awesome! Tips are like the fastest way to get someone to look into a project, as they start pondering over if they should just sell it or hodl. This is exactly how I discovered SmartCah and still hodling it.
Tis the season. This kinda stuff makes me smile
Well I'm never that lucky 🙂
This is awesome!!
"I've been interested in crypto for a long time, and I'm glad to see the community growing quickly!

Edit: Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays!"
"Wait a reddit bot can just send you Bch?
It ask you for a wallet address or something? But more than that im in a reddit thread where everyones nice to eachother that isnt about puppies? Dont get me wrong puppies are cool but learnig about cyrpto has been a treat too"
This is awesome! Merry Christmas!
Awesome people
You mean I can tip and not pay $50 fee and wait until next Xmas for it to arrive?
Merry Bitcoin..
Hahaha this is awesome! Keep up the good work bchsanta hope people are leaving you digital cookies and milk. :)
This is awesome. Keep up the good work, whoever you are.
I don't get it, he's just throwing money at people?  
This is awesome! Love this community
I think I prefer this Santa to pretty much any other version. Ho ho ho, merry crypto!
RIP your inbox Santa, super fun to see so many stoked redditors receiving your Christmas Cheer!!! Hope you get what you want for Christmas too!
No way is this real..
That's one heck of a Christmas present. I wish he would swing my way.
Awesome stuff coming out of this sub. Keep it up next year all.
Whaaaaat that's great, I wish I had the money to join and help out if it's real, but I still haven't even bought any BCH yet because and only because of funds or any time it's has been below 2,3-2,5 on the really high end dips I would have grabbed some. Another example that crypto is finally making some of the right people on this planet well off enough to make other people happy, if only a small number of the actual top top people on this planet financially did this I wonder what the honest difference across the world would really be. I'm blabbering now....just my Highidea. Merry Xmas all.
"Amazing deed with positive impact!!!
 "
God bless you BCH Santa!
That's pretty fantastic, reminds me of all the old Dogecoin tip bots and giveaways you used to see. Hope BCH can bring that spirit back to Crypto.
Really cool
Thanks Santa ! This shall be my starting point for bitcoin
"This guy needs more kudos!
"
This makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside
It is so promising/awesome/weird to see how much money people give away in the cryptocurrency subreddits.
"Not really a fan of bch, but I really find this gesture kind and warming 


Edit: (if you tip me I swear I’ll spank you!)"
thanks /u/BchSanta ahead of time.
Good thing he is using Bitcoin cash! Or else he would spend millions of fees!
Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas!
Santa, did an elf have to help you set up your bch wallet? Or are you just that good? 
Merry Christmas, from the tiny island of Dominica, :D.
Thanks Santa made my night. 
Wow. That's ridiculously cool. It's great that people spread the cheer even though they really don't get much out of it. I sure don't know much about bitcoin, but people are great. 
BCH Santa's are the best Santa! Great to see some people giving back to the group at large. 
u/bchsanta thanks Santa! And Wow yeah someone gave me a tip about a month ago and I had no idea what it was. The Generosity around here is amazing. Thank you all who take time to answer questions for noobs like me!
I'm glad that there's still people who give gift or donate just because to give good to somebody else instead of just for upvotes. Makes me still have faith in this world
We are the future !!
"Let's not forget the guy who made the tippr bot, both of which helped brought a lot of kindness today. Thanks for doing what I wish I had the money to do.

Merry Christmas everyone. "
Santa where ya at? Been looking for ya for while now. 
This is better than Snoop Doggy Dogg’s song Santa is coming to the ghetto.
Wow, that is super awesome! I love to see crypto changing the lives or brightening peoples lives! Kudos /u/BCHSanta and /u/ImSantaClausBCH !
"This is so nice of you, SCBCH! Imagine doing this with BTC; BCH is the what I signed up for when I got into crypto."
I don't know what this is but it makes me smile.
This is pretty cool. BCH is still something I'm learning more about, but I'm glad to see it's getting wider acceptance, and people like this are helping!
"*Starts a slow clap*

Merry Christmas folks!"
Cool
Jeez what a nice dude, I wish I had enough money to be able to do that kind of nice stuff.
Seeing this kinda stuff in the cryto community is really heartwarming, like seeing everyone coming together 
Some people are just awesome. They don't need the attention, they just spread joy. It can be a bit of cryptocurrency or feeding homeless but it doesn't really matter if it's big or small. Doing something just to be nice should always be applauded 
Where the hoes at santa?
It seems like BCH is where it’s at! 
This is awesome and what bitcoin should be!
[deleted]
Outstanding!!
"How do these tip bots work? I remember using one a few years ago to collect/send doge tips, but i can't recall how the wallet is set up / how to access it.

Merry Christmas, everyone. Keep up the good work /u/ImSantaClausBCH.

"
How does Santa deliver crypto?  
I've never owned bch before can I try?
"It’s so wonderful to see that there is a sub on reddit that is so wonderful to everyone!

Gonna see this crypto go far!"
[deleted]
Merry Christmas fellow BCH friends!! ^^
[deleted]
Glad to see some of you who made a blast with crypto sharing with others. That’s the spirit :) Merry Christmas!
That’s awesome to see this time of year. I have to go close the bar and open it tomorrow. Hopefully the customers are as nice u/bchsanta and u/imsantaclausbch
[deleted]
I always new santa was real! Merry Xmas!
Anyone tracked the total amount gifted? 
"Merry Crpto Christmas everyone
"
Dang I'm in. I can't resist. I have to get in on Bitcoin cash now.
Merry Christmas!
And here I thought humanity was doomed.  This guy/gal/whoever gives me faith in humanity again.  Seriously awesome!
What a pleasant surprise to see someone spreading cheer. Lately the crypto communities have felt very discouraging. Nice to see someone rise above all that 
[deleted]
Merry Christmas!
You are boss. Merry Christmas
Ho does that work how can someone send currency over Reddit??
This is amazing! That guy get it. 
"Absolutely amazing. Kudos to you fine sir or madam. 
"
Lol, this is perfect! Go get em bchSanta
Santa tipper can I get some love? A little something to get into some of these alts :(
Great job whoever is doing this. 
Happy holidays, everybody! I love seeing the good cheer. 
Merry Christmas!
"jesus christ really making me go for btc instead,

community seems much, much better."
"Damn yo some people truly get in the spirit!

Quick question does tippr work similarly to Changetip back before they shutdown?"
Lord santa BCH improving everyone Christmas a BCH at the time.
woohoo!
Darn! And just when I made my first purchase or BCH! 
This is really nice to see #faithinhumanity
This totally beats Bitcoin Harry
Need more people like this around the world. Now we need a hold bot too. Now you have some crypto leave it alone. 
Wow that’s incredible it’s really good to see some positivity 
"Am I too late for the love? :c :0
"
This is awesome! Merry Christmas y'all!
Stuff like this brings me back to the good old days of bitcoin
Merey Christmas everyone!!!
I’m not trying to get in on this. Just confused as to how the system knows where to send the tip or how it’s confirmed. He doesn’t have the wallet number.
Awesome 
That’s very generous. Merry Christmas! 
This community is so giving it's amazing.
Cool stuff! Merry Christmas!
Merry christmas! Any love for latecomers?
I'm so configuring my tippr and giving out some love. 
Oh wow, the generosity of absolute strangers continues to amaze me in every sub I end up in, you guys are great
Today alot of people seem to tipp via bch. Bitcoin Cash is going to be used more an more. It's time to move forward. 
About a week until the year of the Cashening!
There are some seriously generous people around here. I hope you all have a great holiday break.
"This guy shows that Christmas is all about giving.
Keep up the good work man.
Merry Christmas. :)"
Aww man Xmas has come... today I guess 
"u/itssantabch u/bchsanta u/imsantaclausbch u/hdctd will the real Saint Nick, please stand up! Just wondering, is it one guy behind all the names/some of them, or ?

Also, is there a wallet I can use with desktop or web and android support/syncing? What do you guys recommend?

Good looking out all around by the santa team. Merry Christmas to all.

P.S. you guys have ignited the christmas spirit in me, so I am spending this free time trying to release some not quite finished small open source projects. Not quite the same level of giving, but it is the best way for me currently =) Merry Christmas"
If you scroll down his post history, its just pages and pageeees of him giving money away... Damn, dude mustve given away $1000-2000 only today!

I started with nothing 3 months ago and now because of tippr and yours.org and Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash going up in value I owe crypto worth of about 200 USD. That's pretty cool hey! Now I am going to do my best not to make the same mistake with Bitcoin tips I made 4 years ago ... 
Merry Christmas pal. Here’s another /u/tippr $2 
"But what about /u/BitcoinCashSatan? 

What does HE tip? "
So wait, those tips are real? I thought they were just fun reddit things.... Cause how do they send to your wallet?

Merry xmas"
"I am not Santa but I do have some Bitcoin Cash (although not much) 

$0.1 /u/tippr 


Oh and all my Bitcoin Cash I got from redditors and other people on the internet. (yours.org is a nice place to get some Bitcoin Cash for your content). So far the last couple of months I have received tips from people that are now worth about 200 dollars all together. (I converted some to Ethereum) 

Merry Christmas!!!!! 
"
[deleted]
It brings a very special cheer to see you sharing the experience!  Thanks!
It's absolutely awesome how you're spreading awareness for Bitcoin Cash! Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas!  I’ve been nice most of the year! May I have some BCH?!
"Thanks you for being the crypto Santa we need! It reminds me of the early days of Bitcoin where everyone tipped each other. 

> Now it is up to each of us to urge merchants to accept Bitcoin Cash, to use crypto if the merchant accepts it.  

This should be our motto for the new year :)"
Legend!
 Thanks for spreading holiday cheer. Merry Christmas to all and look foward to the new year.
Thanks bitcoin Santa. The hereo every doge needs. 
Thanks for everything you have done to help spread the kindness and awareness. Merry Christmas!
"HO! HO! HO!  Santa read for months about this and is thrilled to hear that people are excited about it!  As you know, I am all about the *giving*, and having a way that anyone in the world can transact with someone on the other side of the globe is incredible!  I've sent tips today to Tokyo, Austria, Norway (some unfortunate NFL fans cheering for the Cleveland Browns with an 0-15 season). 

BCH makes all this possible, with lots of magic from tippr !!

u/tippr $5 Merry Christmas!"
HO! HO! HO!  That's the spirit!  u/tippr $5 Merry Christmas.  It *can* be Christmas every day!
Two Santa's are move decentralized than one! u/tippr $5

There's still time to change to the Good list!  Santa knows you can! u/tippr $5 for encouragement!  Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas to you, too!  u/tippr $5
The tippr bot works quite well, and fees aren't a problem for BCH.  Since it is Christmas, Santa's been spreading cheer.  u/tippr $5
"Merry Christmas!

/u/tippr $5"
"Someone is on Santa's nice list! Thank you for everything you've done for Bitcoin Cash, /u/zquestz!

/u/tippr $50"
"Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas!

/u/tippr $5"
Yes!  Bitcoin Cash has the fundamentals and the scaling plans to keep fees low for the long term.  Magic.  Just like Christmas!  HO! HO! HO! u/tippr $5
Merry Christmas to you, as well!  u/tippr $5
"/r/bitcoin use to have a tippr bot called changetip .. .but this was before bitcoin made some people very wealthy. Some of those people then started to aggressively protect their wealth and some other who had worked out but missed out on that wealth joined in. This lead to bitcoin (and crypto in general) becoming an over-9000-lets-all-get-rich-quick meme.  

And Bitcoin only has a real chance of changing the world (not necessarily for the better) if it becomes a money. And for it to become a money, transactions and tips and buying stuff with it and paying for internet services  for it are essential. And so we tip, one tip at a time. There are no shortcuts when it comes to user adoption, unlike getting-rich-quick where you have cheats like Tether and other fraudulent douchebagery going on. (and that will make many many victims in the near  future).

"
"Do some research.  Search, read, and ask.  The r/btc forum is very helpful and can discuss everything about either the BTC or BCH flavor of Bitcoin, as they share the same history.  Just different ideas on what it should be: a storage unit, or a cash that you can also store.  Having a use is what gives something value.  If you can't enjoy it, then it might as well be an old toy you've grown tired of, but don't want to throw out for sentimental reasons.

Merry Christmas!  u/tippr $5 and a HO! HO! HO!"
"Merry Christmas!

/u/tippr $5"
Merry Christmas!  Have some BCHeer!! u/tippr $5
"Ho ho ho! This makes Santa jolly!

/u/tippr $5"
Santa's da man, if I say so myself (which I do).  Merry Christmas!  Have some Bitcoin Cash cheer!  u/tippr $5
What's red coin?
/u/tippr $5
What an awesome person. I hope you get lots of good karma and blessings your way.
Ha!  I like the name!  If I get a chance to visit Tokyo, I will contact you!  
There was the pineapple fund, but I think he's on our side now lol
The reasons are very much one and the same as the scaling debate.  Bad elves are trying to limit how you can use your money.  Christmas is for giving, and for learning humility in receiving.  u/tippr $5 for a Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas!  u/tippr $5  Pass it on and you can be a Santa, too!  HO! HO! HO!
It's getting better but we still suffer from some kind of stockholm syndrome. Hopefully we all collectively forget about /r/bitcoin and bitcoin core .. and leave them do whatever they want ... so we can all move on and become a community in good standing with everybody on reddit.  
Merry Christmas! u/tippr $5 and spread the Christmas cheer, no matter what day it is!
"Instant delivery that even Amazon can't beat!  Ho! Ho! Ho!  These Bitcoin Cash elves are really on the ball!  Merry Christmas!  u/tippr $5

Giving everyone control of their own money, combined with the ability to send it to anyone on the planet is simply a gift to the entire world."
There are lots of Santas!  You can be one, too!  u/tippr $5  Merry Christmas!

It’s like a cryptohug :) that’s awesome though /u/tippr
Still giving? 
"Hello Santa, I'm a bit late but you're doing such a heartwarming thing. Merry xmas! u/bchsanta

Just found out about this this reddit, so happy to be here."

Wow. I'm always impressed by the generosity shown by people in the crypto currency world. 
The generosity of people is amazing. /r/btc is definitely one of the nicest most giving communities.
[deleted]
How can we get a tip? I would love one 😊
Happy Xmas and get ready for the new year! u/bchsanta
Hah! reminds me of u/bitcoinbillionaire but there's actually a reason!
Whoelsome :)
While I'm not a fan of Bcash, I will say that it's nice to see someone spreading the joy of cryptocurrency and seeing it evolve. I love the fact that someone is taking time out of their day to spread the cheer. Merry Christmas everyone!
Is this real. If so thanks santa babe. 
I love this Santa, IT show how easy And fast Can be to tip Also small amout of money in BCH. 
Merry Christmas 🤶🏾 🎅🏿! 
Just wanna say Merry Christmas to my fellow HODLers! Started crypto mining 4 months ago and thought i was late to the game. In fact I realized I am just getting started.  Made a decent profit and today I'm hosting a Christmas party at home for all my friends that is completely paid for from my earnings of Bitcoin Cash.  🍻!
santa must have a great mining rig in the north pole
BCH Santa is totally a millionaire

"Santa shows the usability of BCH!  <3 ""Those who truly believe are always rewarded with the truth"" --  Happy Holidays everyone!!!  --"
It's a Christmas miracle!
Merry christmas everyone! 😀
This guy is such a generous person!
Kermit is fucking awesome.

Same, this is awesome! 
These are some of the first times I've seen someone give money to a stranger on the internet as a gift... I love this sub!
This is insane, such a great cause! Please don't tip me you already did!
All the love! What a great community. 
"Merry xmas /u/tippr usd $2

Thanks for this dank robot "
$2 /u/tippr
Thanks for spreading the cheer u/bchsanta
"Thanks for making it possible!  This is great fun.  Like /u/ImSantaClausBCH , it is just a way to spread cheer.

I've been using the r/random link to fly all over Reddit, finding top stories in each subreddit where someone is spreading Christmas wishes and/or humor to others.

Some great comments come back from people (much more interesting than the usual letters they send to me).  They've heard of BCH and can't wait to tell their friends, or they are already using crypto in their city or country.

Merry Christmas to all!  And spread the good BCHeer!!!  HO! HO! HO!"
could i get a gift too? :D

Merry Christmas everyone!
I mean, it's not much of a question if you did exactly that, is it?
How does one get bch by u/bchsanta?
"Is this just a big thread filled with handouts? :) Nice to see tippr in other subreddits, and all the ""what's this now?"""
"/u/bchsanta is doing an amazing job!

Hopefully it will increase adoption :)
"
I gave away most of my BCH tipping and shilling BCH on Facebook. For sure if I'm doing this right. 
Didn’t know you could receive crypto through reddit. Amazing and keep spreading the love!
First experienced tipping with Dogecoin. Glad to see the Reddit tradition still going w other coins.

You got it!  u/tippr $5 and a Merry Christmas!
You think I'm a maniac, you should see Mrs Santa!  Oh! About the tipping.  How else to share the magic of Christmas than magic internet money??
"Someone wrote a bot called 'tippr' that simply tracks what you've received or tipped.  You can add more Bitcoin Cash to your account, or withdraw it to a wallet program.  There is a help link on the message or you can check r/tippr for more information and get assistance.

Oh! and tippr also works on Twitter (it is a separate account from the one on Reddit).

u/tippr $5  Merry Christmas!  Enjoy!  Ask questions.  The r/btc crowd is very helpful."
Thanks!  Now you do, too! u/tippr $5 Merry Christmas!
Because it's Christmas!  Santa wants to make people aware of Bitcoin Cash and some of the things it can do!  u/tippr $5  Now you have some you can tip others with, or you can read the instructions to withdraw it to a Bitcoin Cash wallet.  Merry Christmas!  Sometimes the best gifts are the ones we didn't know we wanted.
"u/tippr $5

Merry Christmas!"
"Yep.  Santa is giving out Bitcoin Cash tips.  u/tippr $5  Merry Christmas!  Now you can tip others or hold onto it.  Check out the help link on the message from tippr or visit the r/tippr subreddit for information and assistance!

Santa feels that Bitcoin Cash is a gift.  Read more about it here on r/btc and ask questions!  There are some very helpful elves here.  Have fun!"
Good for you!  Yes, this is what we expected and wanted Bitcoin to be.  Oh well, we're back on track and gaining speed.  So much innovation and merchant support is going on.  It's even hard for Santa to keep up with!  u/tippr $5 HO! HO! HO!  
Thanks, and a Merry Christmas to you, too! u/tippr $5  There are incredible people here!
HO! HO! HO! u/tippr $5  Spread the Christmas cheer!
"There seem to be a few!  We're decentralized!  u/tippr $5 Merry Christmas!  Just tonight, I have tipped people in Norway, Japan, China, Austria, and now the 'other' Austria <grin>, sorry, Australia.  Very cool!  Santa can do this from his living room.

HO! HO! HO! Merry Cryptmas to you, too!"
1-2-3. Yep!  The test works!  u/tippr $5 Merry Christmas to you, too!
Merry Christmas to you, too!  u/tippr $5
Thanks!  Merry Christmas to you, too!  u/tippr $5
"This is an exciting community, as there is lots of innovation because the fees are planned to be very low.  Our goal is to allow it to be usable by those who only earn $2 a day.  Look around r/btc and ask questions!

Now you have some, too!  u/tippr $5  Merry Christmas!"
It's got me smiling, too!  It is fun to give.  The reactions are great!  u/tippr $5 Merry Christmas!
"u/tippr $5  Now you have some you can use to tip, as well!  Merry Christmas!  Enjoy playing with this.  You can hold it, spend it, send it to a Bitcoin Cash wallet you control, or tip small amounts to people.  Even a few pennies is an appreciated gesture.

You too, can be Santa!  Enjoy! Search, read, ask!  r/btc has very helpful elves."
And a Merry Christmas to you, too!  u/tippr $5  Good for Bitcoin Cash, too.  Enjoy and have fun!

"Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas!

/u/tippr $20"
Yes!  Magic Internet Money.  From Santa.  What could be more fun?? (well, lots of things, but still...)  u/tippr $5  Merry Christmas.  Get used to being amazed, because Bitcoin Cash has a very bright future.
"Check the 'about' link on the replies from tippr or check out the r/tippr subreddit for information and assistance.  It's pretty simple.  Just PM the 'tippr' user a subject and message of 'help' for information.

u/tippr $5  Now you have Bitcoin Cash to tip with! It's that simple.  You can deposit more BCH or withdraw to a BCH wallet of your own.  Low fees, so even small amounts work.  Everything is managed internally by tippr until you withdraw, and then it becomes an on-chain transaction.

Merry Christmas!  Search, read, and ask!  The r/btc elves are very helpful!"
HO! HO! HO! u/tippr $5 
And there's some Bitcoin Cash for you, too! Merry Christmas! u/tippr $5
Santa will buy you a coffee.  Maybe not a triple expresso, but at least a nice cup of coffee.  Merry Christmas! u/tippr $5 and HO! HO! HO!
"This is about Christmas, but also about spreading awareness of Bitcoin Cash.  People have been hearing about it, and Bitcoin, in the news lately, but they've never seen it or had any experience with it.  A simple tip is an easy introduction.  Once people own even a small amount, they have incentive to learn about it.  This amount is sufficient to tip others or perhaps the value will grow and they could buy items or services over the internet with it.

Search for information, read what you can, and ask questions!  Most of us are interested in Bitcoin Cash because it plans to be a means of exchange even for people who only earn $2 a day and have no access to banks or merchants they can't walk up to.  This changes everything, and it is secure.

Read more on r/btc 

u/tippr $5 HO! HO! HO!"
"They say the gift is in the giving.  If this helps Bitcoin Cash gain visibility and attracts people from various subreddits, that will grow support and adoption. I don't know who anyone is here, but they may be merchants, or they may tell their friends.  It will grow organically.  Not by speculators, but by being useful.  The first step is for people to see this and get a little amount they can play with. 

u/tippr $5 and a very Merry Christmas!"
"Merry Christmas!

/u/tippr $5"
"Ho ho ho! 

/u/tippr $5"
"Santa uses an robotic elf called tipper.  When it sees its name mentioned it scans the message for an amount.  It tracks the tips for the recipient (you) and you can then tip or withdraw the funds to your own Bitcoin Cash wallet.

Check out the r/tippr subreddit for information or ask for assistance!

u/tippr $5

Merry Christmas!"
"With the tippr bot. 

/u/tippr $5"
"Sure can! 
u/tippr $5
Merry Christmas!  You can start tipping others, if you'd like!  Search for answers, read, and ask questions on r/btc.  The elves here are very helpful.  Have fun!"
Santa has been having lots of fun!  This will only get better now that we can innovate with cheap transactions and a solid plan for growth!  u/tippr $5 and a Merry Christmas!
"Ho ho ho!

/u/tippr $5"
"I agree! Merry Christmas. 

/u/tippr $5"
Yes!  Santa loves giving out Bitcoin Cash for Christmas!  u/tippr $5 HO! HO! HO!
Merry Christmas! u/tippr $5
And Merry Christmas to you! u/tippr $5  Certainly the r/btc community has been great!  2018 should be exciting!
"And Merry Christmas to you, too!  u/tippr $5

Spread the message of Bitcoin Cash!"
"Well have a Merry Christmas, and some Bitcoin Cash, too!  u/tippr $5

May all your customers be happy and also tip well!"
HO! HO! HO! and a Merry Christmas to you, too!  u/tippr $5
"You don't need to wait!  Once I tip you, you can start tipping, too!

u/tippr $5

There ya go!  Merry Christmas!  Check out r/tippr for information and assistance.  Be the Santa!  People greatly appreciate even $0.01 tips, as the gesture means quite a lot.  Have fun! Ask questions!"
"No, but I fully expect someone will give us a report tomorrow.  This Santa is giving out u/tippr $5, but others were giving out much larger sums.  None of us coordinated this, we just all came to the idea on our own.  The reactions have been enthusiastic from all over the subreddits I visited earler via /r/Random_ 

Christmas is for giving, and I can't think of a better thing to give (and receive).  HO! HO! HO!"
And a Merry Crypto Christmas to you!  u/tippr $5

Santa is *very* glad for all the support and excitement this has achieved.  I did not expect this level of enthusiasm.  The future is bright, indeed."
"Merry Christmas!

/u/tippr $5"
"Santa is having fun!  There is so much innovation and support coming from everywhere for Bitcoin Cash.  Most of us are interested in this being a way for even those who earn just $2 a day to safely keep there money and use to to transact globally.  Today, most of the people in that category can only interact face-to-face.  We've solved the problem, now we need to let people know about it.

Santa is all about giving, so I just thought this was a great way to promote Bitcoin Cash and have fun at the same time!

u/tippr $5 and a Merry Christmas."
And a Merry Christmas to you!  u/tippr $5 of super cool Bitcoin Cash!  Have fun!

Santa doesn't need a cape.  Have a Merry Christmas! u/tippr $5

Merry Cryptomas, and Christmas, to you!  u/tippr $5  We can do this with Bitcoin Cash, and I just want to show that it is possible.  Have a very merry holiday!
Santa's busy tonight!  u/tippr $5  Pass it on!  Tip others.  People even appreciate $0.01 since it is 'the thought that counts'.  HO! HO! HO! Merry Christmas!
"Where I'm from, we think 'Xmas' is a dirty word.  We like it to be called 'Christmas'  (LOL).  Bitcoin Cash can do it because on-chain fees are cheap, and will stay cheap by design.  The entire intention of the whitepaper is to be an electronic cash for everyone, even those who only make $2 a day.  They have every right to be able to secure their money, too.

Like Bitcoin Cash, Christmas is for sharing with others.  u/tippr $5  Have a great Christmas!"
They actually tried to tip people but the wait time is now 4 days to get it. 
And a very Merry Christmas to you, as well!  Santa is working on it.  So much fun to see the reactions across Reddit!  u/tippr $5 HO! HO! HO!
"Yep! Santa Claus loves his BCH!

"Yes, the 'bad elves' over there have made it impractical for use as cash.  Even if their mempool shrivels up, people are learning that they simply don't want the same peer-to-peer cash that Bitcoin started with.  u/tippr $5 for a Merry Christmas and a bright future!

"You can PM the user 'tippr' and use a subject and message of 'help'.  Also, r/tippr has additional information and assistance.  u/tippr $5 Merry Christmas!

You can now tip all or part of that to someone on any thread.  Plenty of examples in this thread.

Magic tips for Christmas!  How appropriate!  HO! HO! HO!"

We are all Santa.  We are all Satoshi.  u/tippr $5 so you can be Santa, too.  Merry Christmas!

Makes Santa very glad his a redditor, too!  Great communities!  Even the ones I found through r/random have been incredibly happy to receive the small gift.  u/tippr $5  Merry Christmas!  
"Everyone can be a Santa.  There are those that will help.  They are the ones keeping things from flying apart at the seams and degenerating into chaos.  They are the ones pulling people back together when times are rough.

Christmas is about being a helper when you have those opportunities.  u/tippr $5 Merry Christmas, to you, too!"
Me too :D
Santa is just using tippr.  You can find out more at r/tippr or PM the 'tippr' user with a subject a message 'help'.  The tippr bot works with Bitcoin Cash.  I am not sure of the other bot provided.  Either way, people enjoy the gift.  Both giving and receiving.  u/tippr $5 and Merry Christmas!
"Gotta try and make it look like people are using it huh.

Let's just ignore the fact its off chain and exactly the same thing could be done with BTC.

Fucking delusional..."

Santa knows who's on their naughty list, and it does not match mine.  u/tippr $5   Merry Christmas!
Thanks.  Santa is not in this for the Reddit karma, but the other existential karma is great to have and to give.  Merry Christmas, and thanks for all the great work you do for Bitcoin Cash.  We're all Santa.  u/tippr $5 HO! HO! HO!
Hardly.  This Santa is just someone who appeared tonight to spread cheer around various corners of Reddit.  u/tippr $5 to wish you a Merry Christmas!  You can hold onto this, or tip others small amounts.  The thought is what matters. HO! HO! HO!

It is an amazing community.  The innovation and excitement since August 1 has been incredible,  This is what it felt like in 2013 before this scaling debate tore down the fun use-cases like tippr and yours.org.  We're getting our mojo back, stronger than ever.  This is a Christmas to remember!
Here's another for you! u/tippr $5 for a Merry Christmas!

Love seeing this. It’s almost 8am on my Christmas Day. Sitting on the floor at our airport gate for the last 3 hours. My partner is napping beside me while we wait for the plane to begin boarding. Thanks for the extra smiles.

So awesome!! Merry Christmas bchsanta!!
"God bless this u/bchsanta. I’m fairly new to this subreddit, but the honest, open discussion is just so much more welcoming than other certain subreddits. As somewhat of a noob, I almost feel afraid to comment on other cryptocurrency subreddits with the fear of being ridiculed, but this is a place where people are eager to help each other, and for that I’m thankful. MERRY CHRISTMAS!

Edit: tagged the jolly man himself"
"The spirit of Christmas is alive and well :) 
I'm currently living in Japan so the Christmas spirit was a little low here.. Also had to work on Christmas.
MERRY CHRISTMAS EVERYONE!"
I always get to see this kind of things too late, but I am happy that there are still good people out there, who are still non-toxic on the internet and try to do good things to random people on the internet! I wish I could see more people like you in the internet and in irl. Merry Christmas! 
That’s so sweet of him 
Lol try doing this with Bitcoin core.
It's awesome to see this community come together during the holidays! Happy holidays everyone :^)
Faith in humanity restored 
Merry Christmas from Canada!
Im late to the tipping party I guess. But merry xmaas everybody! 
"Honestly, this shows there's still humanity in this world, even when 2017 has had some harsh events.

I've realized this more and more on Reddit, and although Santa hasn't visited me on Reddit, I'm thankful he's visited others."
Merry x-mas to everybody! To me xmas is a cultural event, rather than religious. So this goes to everybody!
How is he doing it?!
I guess I was bad this year or was just overlooked again. Merry Christmas anyways. :)
What a absolute legend :-)
No way is this still going on.

if this was taking place on the dark side,  you'd probably get banned for spamming the network and be told to wait for lightning which wouldn't work anyway... long live bch, it's bitcoin resurected!
Glad to see folks spreading some Christmas cheer! 
"Love it! Utipper got me into crypto and love the way it helps spread awareness! Merry Christmas all ;) "

Now just think... if this were Core, you'd have to tip $50 for your recipient to even see $5 ;)"
Wish Everyone a Merry Xmas and Santa does exist :)
Merry Christmas tot all of the btc subreddit users! We've come a long way, but there is so much more we are able to achieve next year.
Who said it's a guy? 
Awesome, he should get more recognition. Love seeing people randomly make people's day😀
"Santaaaaaa, I don't have any BCH left to tip you But I left you all the best crispy chewy chocolate chip cookies!
Merry Christmas! :)
 /u/bchsanta /u/ImSantaClausBCH"
Hope for humanity restored. Thank you fren.
Have a nice holiday 
Dear Santa, I just want good will to all men and peace on the blockchain. 
This reminds me of earlier days in Bitcoin when there was so much hope and optimism in the community. Tipping on social media has to be the coolest and most effective way to promote BCH, or any cryptocurrency for that matter.
Haha, amazing Reddit Christmas here!! :)
A huge thanks to everyone tipping and spreading joy! This is what sets This community apart from others! Truly wonderful people!! (I've already been tipped $5) I am just showing my appreciation to the Santa's and the community! Stay close friends! 
I've been a good boy this year, return to crypto after 2 years away, so maybe I deserve at least a ho-ho-ho
Man this is so cool, this community is full of incredible people, kudos to all of you guys!
Can I get some btc?
"More comments than likes, shame! 

Merry Christmas regardless "
A true Christmas miracle :-).
"This is what p2p money is all about. No borders or constrictions. Thanks to the r/btc community and thanks to all those who have tipped and spread knowledge this year. Merry Christmas BCH

"
/u/bchsanta is it too late to get some of that Christmas BCH? Regardless have a Merry Christmas!
Get our Bch Chanta on Mass Media around the world, fund our Santa on his mission. Great news, happy times!
That’s some amazing generosity!
now I wish I had BCH to give others :(
I love this guy
Wow, someones definitely spreading some Christmas cheer around. Thanks for all you're doing! 
"Man, it is wonderful and will encourage a lot of people to learn about Bitcoin Cash and how the Wallet works, i wish both of you a Merry Christmas /u/bchsanta 
Edit: Thanks, you made my day :)"
Damn that's awesome what a boss

That’s really neat
True Christmas spirit for good!
This is a really cool thing to do. Thanks BCH Santa for spreading holiday cheer.
What a gem of a fictional character
Hello Santa I don’t have any bch and didn’t get any for Christmas :( 
Merry Christmas to y'all!!! Hodl on and in the blockchain we trust! Let's make a great exchange using tippr bot!
Merry Christmas Santa. You’re amazing for this 
Seeing all the fellowship and giving is pretty awesome. Haapy to be part of a great community. 🍻<-- spiked egg nog. :)
This is amazing...lol. Merry Christmas to all...I'll be at work for 13 hours today! Next year I'll be at home!

Merrry Christmas all the way from Dominica /u/bchsanta!
Great job, also a good way to spread the encouragement to use bch coin. Cheers santa. Have a fun day 
Way to get the word Bch santa, merry Christmas
Merry Christmas everyone!   🎄
Let’s make it an extra merry Christmas! I will match any gift today that /u/bchsanta gives 
Wait where was he when I need it.
Wow I could really use some of that this Christmas. 
/u/Bchsanta what I really want for holidays  is 2 grand  in BCH
Well I usually think that's the case when my debating partner gets in a huff and refuses to continue with any valid counter-arguments. 
"If you wish to interpret it that way to suit your narrative, power to you.

"
Precious.  You just keep on thinking that.
"I saw your post about your friend, went through your post history and gave you a test.

Welcome to reality."
I'm glad you've seen that you were incorrect. 
"Oh I'm just stating facts. It's interesting that you don't have actually have a counter-point though.

I value constructive debates, so I'm going to not reply to you anymore, unless you make a worthwhile point. "
"I've seen enough, you have fun with your ""store of value"". "
"You mean the thread where I talked about how my friend was turned away from crypto because of the toxic nature of /r/btc and /r/bitcoin?

I fail to see how this has any relevance to Bitcoin being a store of value, but I'm sure you're enlightened in ways no-one can understand. "
"Art has no utility.
Gold, in its majoratively invested form, has no utility. 

The market for gold is $6 trillion+, and still operates as an excellent store of value, despite having no practically used utility. 

I'm not saying you're incorrect in that Bitcoin could follow the paths of Tulips, however, it could also not.

This is how you view Bitcoin's future:

- Bitcoin keeps increasing in value.
- Sudden selling.
- People keep selling.
- It doesn't stop.
- Bitcoin dies.

However, this could happen:

- Bitcoin keeps increasing in value.
- Bitcoin acts as a store of value and is only used for very large purchases (houses, cars, etc.).
- Bitcoin experiences dips and highs.
- Bitcoin plateaus at a market cap, above that of gold, since it's much more transactionable than gold.
"
No, just you can't understand.  
Lmao ok this one got me
Sure thing, buddy. Keep going with your mysterious tests - at least you know how a store of value works now. 
"So, what you're saying is; BTC is going the way of seashells and tulips."
If you wish to interpret it that way to suit your narrative, power to you. 
It isn't. But as I said, if you want to interpret it that way, that's fine. 
"See, you're making up your own argument now - probably to gain some face which you lost when you realised you misunderstood how a store of value works (when you thought a store of value needed to have utility).

I'm not talking about BTC vs BCH. I'm not talking about cryptocurrency. I'm not talking about the feud between the two. I'm correcting you on your initial post:

>How does a store of value even work when there is no utility

As discussed, you were wrong. A store of value doesn't need to have any utility, just consensus (look at gold, art, sea shells, etc.). By the way, I happen to agree with you that BCH is more practical to use than BTC. However, that wasn't what we were discussing.

Just chalk it up to your misunderstanding. It's fine - learn and move on. BTC, at the moment, is a good store of value. 
"
Ya, you can cut the attitude. I disagree with you. BCH does everything BTC does *and* is usable. This difference will make more sense to you as you watch the prices continue to grow together. 
So cute, you still think you're correct.  
It's the only way to interpret it.  
This wasn't a debate.  It was a test.
Things once perceived as a store of value with no utility fail.  Present another way.
"Sure. You weren't sure how a store of value without much utility could not fail, I posed examples, and even drew up a scenario for you. You got into a huff and failed to respond. 

Great test you have there. Seemed like a debate about store of value and BTC. Guess I was wrong. "
"Oh my god.

The author thinks that all altcoins are forks of bitcoin.  [facepalm]"
"> But 100 coins offer that..

Well, the market seems to think otherwise. Why do you think that is? Perhaps you're missing something that ""the mindless people in here"" are not?

> 0 coins offer the store of value BTC does.

""Store of value"" is a myth and joke, with the volatility that BTC is experiencing. Have people who bought bitcoin at 16k, 17k, 18k, or 19k experienced this wonderful ""store of value""? No. 

But now you'll say ""what about the people who bought below 13k? To which my answer is ""they saw a great appreciation in their **investment**. Bitcoin has proven to be a great **investment asset**, but as far as financial instruments go, you [(and the people you get your information from)](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7m1got/not_long_ago_btc_dominance_of_the_total_market/drqu2rm/?context=3) need to understand that they're on the other end of the spectrum from ""reliable store of value instruments"". 

BTC is not a SoV. No cryptocurrency is at this stage, in fact. But when on top of that you add such a massive unreliability so as to become increasingly unusable for most the time at this point, you have an instrument that's approaching 100% of pure speculatory value.

The efficient Market Hypothesis is false; such assets inevitably fall down in value to zero in time. And the champaign-corking people in charge of BTC don't seem like they're about to do anything about BTC's status quo anytime soon.

So for christmas I wish for you to think about the inner consistency of the things you're defending.
"
If someone wanted store of value why wouldn't they just buy real gold?at least everytime you move your gold it doesn't lose some of its value
Something can only act as a store of value if it itself has value. I'm gonna guess that the longer BTC has these high fees and high turnaround times people will move away from it and its value will decline. However, I'm not really invested emotionally or monetarily (okay i got $10 in BCH from the xmas tipfest that's been happening but in reality i'm not really invested monetarily) in it and am mainly interested from an empirical standpoint.
"Store of value is a result of ability to exchange value with someone else at a later date. Higher transaction fees on BTC impede the ability to exchange hence the birth of low transaction fee BCH.

Water built up behind a hydro-electric dam is a store of value because that water can later be converted into electricity."
What makes bitcoin valuable? Also with how much the price fluctuates how can you call bitcoin a store of value?
[Watch this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjRoQYsVIY4). BTC is *not* a store of value. Any rebuttals post them on the video.
Have some Bitcoin Cash to play with the transaction fees. I'm pretty sure you can get very low fees, though it can take a while (30 mins to 1 hour) for the transaction to come through. $1 u/tippr
How are you moving your BCH? Whatever exchange or wallet you’re using is overcharging. I’m able to move mine around with my Ledger wallet using fees that are fractions of a cent.
Less than one cent
[deleted]
Because hardware will stop improving?
While I agree with the idea that there are other currencies that do currency better than BCH, ripple is a terrible example for that. Ripple is a centralized coin which was pretty much the entire premise behind why Bitcoin was created.
If we are looking for the most useful blockchain then ethereum has both beat, smart contracts and decentralized apps are the future. 
Have some Bitcoin Cash to buy an African cherry. $0.1 u/tippr
"> BTC offers something nothing else does

Such as? High fees and unreliable confirmations? You're damn right."
BCH is BTC as far as I'm concerned. 
What's that then? 
porting the infrastracture to bch is MUCH easier than any other coin. 
Why would you carry a store of value across a border, its not as if your gonna transact with it. 
With segregated witness it's too late, even if they increase the blocksize at this point they are still seriously hampered with all future development 
Yes, I'm giving it time right now and hedging my bets with holding both.

"> It’s the only coin that doesn’t have a “team of people” building it / working on the network.

Not sure if you're familiar with open source technology, but there's only the one github repo and the core Dev team have exclusive commit access. Also, I'm not sure what kind of blockchain knowledge you have (or your buddy in Wall Street) but you may want to look into Blockstream and their ""Lightning Network"" before putting any real money into BTC"
"So you'll take the challenge, then? I'll summon the bot again as it seems to not have worked:

RemindMe! 3 days, ""can /u/scoobycrypto get away with 200sat/B now? Or maybe bitcoin is broken and people aren't 'just fudding'?"""
"so you had to spend $250 because you were afraid you'd have to spend a lot more later on due to network conditions

you know, I completely understand, I did the same not long ago. Then not much later I realized how messed up that was and I gradually sold all of my BTC for cryptocurrencies that just work"
Most of the people here aren't Dutch I reckon xD
number of inputs matters a lot. If you are trying to move something that has been consolidated with a lot of small increments (people who can only afford to buy a small amount of btc and sending it to a wallet) vs someone who can buy 1 whole btc and sending it to a wallet. satoshi per byte gets more expensive as bytes (increased inputs). Also I just checked my copay wallet for my scrap btc (about $9 worth, which only had like 2-3 inputs) and average fee is 955 sat/byte at 30 min confirmation. That is fee set to normal... Super economy is at 646 sat /byte at 4 hours. Can't see the average confirmation time for 200 sat/byte but it would probably take at least a day 
BCH shares the same history. You're left with the market cap only. For now.
You can pay less than a tenth of that
There is no problem.. what IF’s are not a concern. We might as well not use bitcoin now because what if the government finds a way to hack it!! We have to continue doing what Bitcoin has done for the last 8 years.. this is proven to work.. it has the history. Why change that structure to cause artificially high fees because WHAT IF!! 
That's the most tautological statement I've ever heard. How can you possibly think that makes any sense? 
"Well sure but if the price drops because it's chronically not usable for anything other than speculation by large institutional investors and HODLers, then eventually even the people storing value in it will get burned and they'll withdraw from the market.

EDIT and to expand segwit apparently can only raise the block size once, to 2 MB, punting the problem just a little down the road, and if Lightning Network is deployed its structure will naturally empower well-connected financial players who will then become structurally embedded in the circulation side of the network. They will be middlemen extracting rents from bitcoin users while hollowing bitcoin of its differentiation from the traditional financial markets.

Not only must it be usable as a means of exchange it must be outside the control of traditional state and big financial interests in order to offer something over and above traditional currencies in order to remain valuable. Rent-seeking financiers standing between you and a conceptually somewhat ingenious payment system gets in the way of its value. Raising the block size is the simplest and most straightforward way to keep the network at least open."
"Bch not only shares the same history as btc, it actually is a closer to the historical implementation than btc is. 

I'd rather keep the classical secure implementation of bitcoin because I don't trust smart contracts, evidence of why can be found with etherium. If bitcoin cash can solve the problem, why bother with segwit? "
Wow, really?! Anyone else had this experience because I don't know anyone else who has and I certainly haven't? 
XRP is centrally mined and issued by ripple labs. They could shut it down overnight, not for me.
"Calling BS - plus (and sorry but you would do what I'm about to do as well)... your account appears new.  I realize that you seem to be a lisker, and that'd great in my book (probably not a socket puppet)... but still, there are a lot of these and I don't know you :-( 

Ok the meat of my post:

Bitcoin (Legacy) transactions haven't been as cheap as you claim for the typical user, running typical softwares for a loooong time.  Can you roll your own transaction?  Sure. Can you set your own fee? Sure.  Do we see transactions that are basically free in current blocks?  Sure.  

If you need a transaction to happen in under a day, then we are seeing insanely high fees - for the typical person.  What is insanely high - tens of dollars (currently ~50USD).   You can check this yourself: https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactionfees.html

Look.  I eat like crap - but I'm thin.  For every person that this statement is true, there are orders of magnitude more where this statement fails.  Hence why we ask everyone to eat healthy...(Please, eat healthy everyone - its good for you; like low fees.)

Lastly (bringing this back to fees) - high fees are a turn off to a lot of people.  Hell even Cobra is questioning the great path forward.  That says a lot.

Not regulary but because i started in june with hot wallets and exchanges i made a lot of transactions then i got into Paper wallets and had 1 Bitcoin 1 one wallet then split in 10 then again in 4 then split in 100 x 0.01 then again in 1 metal wallet and again in 100x 0.1 i know crazy Cant make up my mind ,but it made me an good user making over 250x transactions in 6 months and average cost would be 2usd .but again i agree the fees are way to high but you can easy pay 200-300 sats to get it thrue 
Not happy about that but had to centralize my Paper wallets to 1 wallet just in case the fee would outrun my value per 0.01 wallet but i was fine with 200sats per byte ,i hold bch and btc but btc is my store of value or toilet Paper but i keep it but not cut up in small pieces anymore

BTC ANS BCH ARE NOT ENEMIES."
Was playing devils advocate. I'd never buy ripple, but a great example that BCH does not hold some unique tech, infact it would have the exact same issues as BTC. It is not a solution to the issues that everyone here mindlessly spouts.
The problem is that you're relying on that. What if hardware capacity does not increase at the same rate as block size increases? You'll end up with blocks that can only be mined by whales, ie more centralization, then we're back at square one. You wouldn't put a bandaid on the Hoover Dam if it were cracked.
You need much more than Moore on your side in order to scale for mass adoption. Storing data is nor the only concern, you need connectivity and low latency otherwise forget about buying your coffee with any of these big blockers coins.

This raises an excellent question. What initially set BCHs price? And why did it not match BTC at the fork? In my  uninformed view it should be worth roughly the same no?
If one is uncertain which way to go then waiting seems like a valid strategy. Even if he waits until BCH is at 100% of BTC price he'll end up with double the coin he had before the fork, which is not too shabby. Not considering fees, of course. And 1-1 price may not be a stable situation.
Segwit actually decreases fungibility of BTC even with a blocksize increase. That's bad for a money. 
Exactly. Bcore has burned too many bridges and miners shouldn't ever want to stay with Bcore over the long term. 
So you spent $250 on transactions where you could have spent $0.05 instead? Congratulations
"The fees have come down after an unusually long weekend + christmas, and the network has been able to eat throught the largest fee'd transactions. 

This will not hold true come tomorrow. 

Do you use bitcoin regularly? Because it doesn't sound like you do. If you do, though, would you care to share your experiences on, say, thrusday, again, and see if the same experience holds? 

RemindMe! 3 days, ""can /u/scoobycrypto get away with 200sat/B now? Or maybe bitcoin is broken and people aren't 'just fudding'?"""
This is what I'm seeing too. Only people having troubles with tx is day traders. Haven't seen these 30-500$ transactions yet. 1 sat/byte is key to calculating seems to be the standard.

Don't wait too long. About every two weeks (Btcs difficulty updates) Bch makes a move, and it's always been a push up in price. In a week or so, we might see bch jump to 5k while btc is still around 15k. This would put it at 30% of BTC. Right now it's holding at 20% of BTCs price. 
But not you. No you're an expert
sounds like a true story :)
I love that you idiots come with a bell
You are a bit sour over Bitcoin Cash aren't you? $0.01 u/tippr
Fork is a common term in computer software. Litecoin and Namecoin were both early forks of Bitcoin. Using clone like you are I think is more confusing since you clone the code to work on it. 
The term fork has been used in open source to mean a fork of the code since years before Bitcoin was invented. So it's not so wrong of WSJ to do the same...
whatever makes you feel better sir.. is not ok to hijack the project.  He could start from start. avoid confusion and maintain a healthy ecosystem 
Elementary technical blockchain knowledge and common sense? I mean you don’t really need one, it’s quite simple if you think about it. It wasn’t an article, it was a statement from my buddy who is part of Wall Street. It’s the only coin that doesn’t have a “team of people” building it / working on the network. It’s not a DAO... it’s the only coin that is truly 100% governed by the miners, which makes it even more so decentralized and “for the people by the people” considering there are more BTC miners than any miners of any other coin out there, which would make the consensus pool even larger and more variable (harder to plan a 51% attack)... doesn’t this make BTC the most trusted place to store your money out of any other coin on the blockchain ?
"How so? Please show me a situation in which BCH does not currently and readily solve BTC's problem (as described in the quotation of the OP) of an average tx cost of $30. 

*EDIT: I see you've countered my argument with a slick downvote, well done m8.
"
This is exactly why I'm still holding both. If the bizarre bloody-mindedness of the small blockers insisting on keeping the system crippled finally ends, BTC still has a major systemic advantage.
it depends who you are...
It's highly unlikely. Just the other day Greg was uncorking champagne to celebrate the high fees. His maliciousness is either intentional or stupid, doesn't really matter which. 
"Perhaps. Are you surprised people who bought something a week ago, might see a decline in what they bought it for? I am not. Lived through a lot of time ""in the red"" with BTC. "
"I bought in well before 13. I didn't say BTC is going to make everyone rich.

Edit: misread. Market agrees, XRP. Offers what BCH does, and has shown much more growth (last 2 months) 

If you want to say BCH is somehow better than BTC (and honestly, idgaf, I own both) at least create your arguments on merit. Saying ""but BTC is XYZ, so it can't work"" is mindless. Point out what BCH does best.. unfortunately, that's nothing."
I don't understand.  I just sent the equivalent of $100 in BTC to an online merchant from my hardware wallet, and my transaction fee was equivalent to $4.00.  I could have lowered it to the equivalent of $0.40, but I didn't want to risk having the transaction take up to 14 hours to be confirmed.  At $4.00, it was confirmed within 5 minutes.
"Why not invest in African cherries? Or figs? You think you're making a point, but you're not.

The fact is, BTC offers something nothing else does. BCH offers something 1000 coins do. Why not ripple? Faster and cheaper than BCH."
Bigger blocks is only a short term solution. 
I didnt propose the If statement. I was replying to the comment that implied that block size increase wouldn't be a problem IF hardware capacity increases. Whereas Bitcoin Core devs are working on ways for Bitcoin to be feasible now, and not relying on IF's. Bitcoin Core will work no matter the case, as it has thus far. 
Stating the obvious once again......
What would be considered a large transaction?  4 digits or more?
Why aren't bitcoin cash transactions free? There is so much room in the blocks yet they're charging >5cents
"But 100 coins offer that.. 0 coins offer the store of value BTC does.

Not talking badly about BCH, honestly, just the echoing rhetoric in here seems mindless. "
"Every argument here is but BTC isn't as good. Yes, I am aware. However, I think the majority of people posting here, have no (real) grasp of crypto historically. Time is the most important element.

BCH isn't bad. Neither is BTC. But if you want to claim BCH is somehow the chosen one, at least back it up. So many coins can offer what BCH does. The only thing BTC offers is history."
"Got nothing to gain here to lie some of the transaction batches i did 10 wallets at a time had a first confirmation in 15min 3 afther 45min-60min 
So really don't understand why somebody would pay 50usd"
Better not 😂 this f**bitcoin cost 300usd to get off the Paper wallets but just now i Discovered the concept of multiple inputs 🤔 result my transaction to get them all to 1 wallet cost a whopping 850usd i almost fell of my chair ,wil never recommend Bitcoin to anyone anymore but wel keep my decimated 1 euh 0.91 Bitcoin to burn death or to sell for 1 million with a 200k transaction fee 😂😂😱not funny

"you can't just upgrade to 2mb blocks or anything like that since that will require a hardfork by the miners and will cause another chain split like was going to happen with segwit1x / segwit2x. 

Since miners have been vilified and many are openly supporting Bitcoin Cash, it is VERY unlikely they will bow down and take orders from Core/blockstream like that.

‪I heard recently the idea that because of the governance “issues” behind bitcoin, it makes it truly decentralized even more so compared to any coin. And that being this is the case, Bitcoin could eventually just be used as a “store of value” for the cryptocurrencies. Fed reserve. Imagine the label:: “BCH... XVG... LTC... etc. , Backed by Bitcoin” - thoughts on this?
I have a good amount of knowledge in this space... I’ve read good things about lightning though...?

Or is it truly “forever” like people say? If I can get a solid answer and explanation for this, it will answer a lot of my fundamental crypto questions.

"I absolutely love the concept of crypto and what its roots stand for.

Perhaps a bit off-topic, but how are we supposed to distribute cryptos to those whom cannot afford to purchase high-end mining equipment, and then an environment to run that equipment in?  It keeps on getting more and more expensive to procure.  If we are to create a new ecosystem from which we separate ourselves from the current banking system, there needs to be alternatives to only supporting one algorithm and perhaps also increasing the total supply.  This would most likely help in preventing a hashogopoly, as some have been saying. We need more people minting currency and not just a select few. How are those in poor countries going to do this by using the SHA algorithm? They can't afford to mine."

"""If the network were to get that big, it would take several years, and by then, sending 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a big deal."" - Satoshi

As CPU power increased then the network should scale as users used more send to each other transactions while the miners mined new coins at greater hash rates. Using moores law would dictate that the capacity in the future would allow for greater transactions that are here today. So far the network has worked without a bottleneck - which as occurred at the transaction points like coinbase who don't have the proper systems in place. Send btc to btc via peer to peer is quick but the send to cash is the fixed point where the bottleneck occurs on the exchanges. To build a 9 year old system that can outrun the big boys even years later is a major accomplishment by itself. 6 days to mine the first block. That test was extrapolated and based on the bandwidth available became the data point for the calculations we see today. Then Satoshi took into consideration the future of increased CPU and capacity of the data center and realized the network was scalable - up an down - He seemed to know a bit about bandwidth also and the mention of it as a component in the equation lets us see his ""Pure Genius"" in a multitude of areas. As multiple versions come into play the best version will converge into the best system available at the time until something better comes along. Satoshi created a financial neuron network."

The government agencies do a simple traceroute on the existing nodes, check which ones haven't been ""upgraded"" to comply, phone up the datacenter (probably like Hetzner, OVH Joe's datacenter and Wholesale internet will cover 98% of the hosters) and tell them their customers are breaking the law and to shut them down immediately. 

POOF! No more ""pseudonimity"" in Bitcoin cash. You have fast and cheap payments that are written in the blockchain for eternity and each and everyone of them is completely traceable back to you with the press of a government agent's button.

Technically possible at the cost of centralizing mining nodes, in a blockchain system where only mining nodes count (full non-mining nodes don't add much in terms of securing the network).
"Devs that are willing to increase the blocksize?

The only reason for Core degenerating is Adam, Greg, Luke, et al, completely against any sort of block increase. If Bitcoin has 2Mb blocks it would be way better off right now. There wouldn’t be *over 200 blocks worth of transactions waiting*.

IIRC, The Bitcoin Cash devs intend to implement an adjustable blocksize setting, so each future increase won’t require a separate hardfork (it’ll allow increases within a “sane” limit. You wouldn’t be able to jump straight to 100Mb blocks or anything crazy like that). That would remove the ability for devs to stall blocksize increases like Core has been doing for years."

You do know that the internet you are currently using depends on infrastructure far more expensive than that right? It's an achievable number.

You do know that miners don't even need the full block they are mining against right? Just the block header of a few kilobytes.

You do know that users don't need full nodes, they don't even need pruned nodes. They just need their private keys of a few kilobytes.
"
His point is that even at this scale, the cost to run the node is still small compared to the cost (equipment + electricity) needed to find proof-of-works to extend the blockchain.  So it does would not really further centralize mining.

"""Go ahead and down-vote me"" is pretty much vote begging."
"Ethereum [has very short block interval - 15sec](https://etherscan.io/chart/blocktime). Bitcoin Cash has  600 sec .
That means Ethereum needs propagate every new block instantly to all miners or competing blocks will be created and network needs to reject all but one. Repeat every 15sec instead of every 600s - thats where inefficiency is.  
Eth can't have to big blocks or orphan chains will skyrocket clogging network even more.

1) Therefore Bitcoin Cash has 600/15 = 40 times more time to grow blockchain.

2) BCH has no huge smartcontracts in blockchain => more space for transactions

BCHs opts to make 0-conf reliable and reasonably secure instead of shorter block interval. 

Today only huge, lucky miner (and with big cost) can **maybe** remove 0-conf tx from block. "
"""Leaving it as last resort"" has in this case meant not doing anything to fix the overfilled blocks for years (except a minor raise by SegWit which is not even near enough or well functioning) and thus crippling it as a currency because this raises fees and transaction times by thousands of percent.

That is making the chain less accessible, ie not open but effectively even closed for a lot of people.

If by ""preserving"" you mean not making any changes to the chain at all, then that would be against the white paper and Satoshis own plans to scale. In the beginning there hadn't even been a limit to how full the blocks could get at all, but this was introduced by Satoshi later as a preventive meassure to stop a potential attack. The plan was thus to make sure the blocks still increased in size, but instead by constantly raising the limit either manually or, as Satoshi himself suggested, automatically in good time before the blocks got anywhere near full."
First we need to fill 32 MB before we need to go bigger. The current limit of 8MB can be raised to 32 MB without a fork.
Then nobody will ever have to pay any fee. Wallets will be programmed to split the coins into amounts which are free from fees

BTC is simply a departure from that, even small blocker agree.

I mean, probably. Smart contracts were a very early idea in bitcoin and that's pretty much what LN is - it's hardly a complex and revolutionary idea. We have been using LN-like systems with fiat for decades now. The first example that pops to my head is digital store fronts where you can add x amount of money and buy things, then cash out the money if you wish show - which is the very same logic that is the lighning network based on.

Not to mention that debit card model is also extremely similar to LN. So really, to say that no one even had an idea of a system like LN in 2009 is pretty silly."

"Centralized would mean running in **one** massive datacenter, or multiple datacenters controlled by **one** organization.
"
I’m curious as to what you think would happen if I wrote a coded a reddit alternative where it’s USP was that each comment made by a user was hashed and stored in a nice free BCH transaction, the aim of which was the prove immutability. The cost to me would be zero, but I potentially might take all available space in your 32MB or even larger blocks, and I am just one website. How does BCH function then? It doesn’t sound particularly scalable to me, except for running more and more users out from running full nodes.
If they're leaving it as a last resort, then what are they waiting for? It isn't getting much worse than this.

Roger is not involved unless you're an idiot
WHO IS THEYMOS
"Why would you think he would want bitcoin to run in massive data centers? Then it isn't decentralized.

It seems a lot of people are losing the point. If it is centralized it loses what gave it its value. The idea was to give a currency to the masses, that was controlled by the masses.

Anyone could easily run their own node and vote on the future of bitcoin. If the blockchain becomes massive, running a full node will be out of reach for anyone without a server farm. And then it becomes a currency for those who had enough money to build the mining farms and nodes. It becomes centralized and then they get to control bitcoins future. Do you think that is what the goal was?

From the whitepaper

""We started with
the   usual   framework   of   coins   made   from   digital   signatures,   which   provides   strong   control   of
ownership,   but   is   incomplete   without   a   way   to   prevent   double-spending.     To   solve   this,   we
proposed a peer-to-peer network using proof-of-work to record a public history of transactions
that   quickly   becomes   computationally   impractical   for   an   attacker   to   change   if   honest   nodes
control a majority of CPU power.""

It says peer to peer, it says it maintains its integrity by honest nodes controlling the majority of the network. They remain honest by remaining decentralized. Once they are centralized, the nodes are no longer honest. Because the owner could force the nodes to accept forged blocks. And then you are left with a centralized currency open to manipulation just like every other fiat.

So if centralization is okay with what you think bitcoin should be, then what the fuck is the purpose of bitcoin? It is just another currency owned and controlled by the rich. "
lol no
"This.

Why do humans crave godlike personalities so much? Satoshi, whilst brilliant, was just a person who, like us all, was not always correct.

hahaha you guys just can't accept and believe that sn whitepaper is not a final version and that he or they realized things change along the way
It sounds like it's not a lot but imagine every bigger company and bank world wide running a mining node. That's gonna be millions of nodes and that's way more than we have now. I'd say that's pretty decentralised.
"How did you even come up with that conclusion?  
I'm just saying that a claim that ""people had no idea of X before now"" is a borderline-retarded claim every time it's made.

People quite often dream and discuss models that are not available right now.   

Also coming back to LN - it's hardly a new concept, we've been using currency contracts for decades in terms of debit cards and digital storefronts."

Fees used to be entirely optional, right? Or am I remembering incorrectly? I think when I sent and received bitcoin in 2011-2012, I had the option to include a fee of my choice to speed up transactions, but most transactions were verified near-instantly even with the fee set to zero.

Nick Szabo is a computer scientist, legal scholar and cryptographer known for his research in digital contracts and digital currency. He graduated from the University of Washington in 1989 with a degree in computer science. He holds an honorary professorship at the Universidad Francisco Marroquín.

The phrase and concept of ""smart contracts"" was developed by Szabo with the goal of bringing what he calls the ""highly evolved"" practices of contract law and practice to the design of electronic commerce protocols between strangers on the Internet.

>Long story short: Ver started falsely quoting Andreas, saying that BTC will crash due to lack of 'scaleability,' which is not what was said at all. I happened to listen to the talk Andrea held where he said there will be a shake out incoming, but it will be due to the mass of ponzi schemes and general bullshitters in the scene, impending lawsuits and people who are sold down the river by these fraudsters. Nowhere did Andreas even remotely mention this 'scaleability' malarkey Ver was spouting.

This is what I mean, it's sad there can't be an honest discussion on these two chains.  It seems the only place it's remotely possible currently is on twitter.  I may not agree with this subreddit currently (I'm open minded) but the hypocrisy here I felt needed to be called out.  

Edit:  Lets be honest here, Andreas obviously supports the lightning network, he spoke of it in numerous video's and envisions micro transactions where you can, for example, pay as you watch youtube video's or movies on netflix.  Radical possibilities that currently aren't possible.  I honestly don't think he minds bitcoin cash, I think he believes it will work itself out and he's not in it for the money or to take any sides, but Roger Ver is out of line for even hinting that Andreas believes bitcoin will crash.  "
Hmm that doesn't make a lot of sense to me. Couldn't huge transactions just be divided into multiple smaller transactions? 
"I didn't say to upvote me, I'm just trying to emphasize that downvoting people with deferring opinions into the negatives is not all inclusive, nor is it an open discussion, it's just another circle jerk.  If you point the finger at another subreddit while continuing to do the same for your subreddit, what's the difference? 

I don't have all the answers, but I would love to see an honest open discussion on the differences between the two scaling paths.  By downvoting which posts you ""initially"" don't agree with, you're pushing the other side of the argument under the rug, or off to the side, in effect muzzling the other side of the argument while claiming to be better than that.  Initially, I'm sure everyone here just heard of bitcoin and not bitcoin cash, and are probably just as frustrated with bitcoin ""core"" supporters trying to muzzle your voice. "
I suppose you're right. The it'll be safer to increase the blocksize in increments . So far 8MB is more than enough - LTC is doing great right now with 4MB (in 10 minutes 4 X 1MB). BCH could scale today X100 without any 2nd layer or at any compromise in mining.
I could be wrong but there's a question of whether miners would want to include transactions that jeopardizes the economic success of the coin. I mean we have seen with bitcoin how full blocks make an impact on the price of bitcoin on the exchanges so ultimately speaking insane usecases could simply be blocked to ensure the sending/receiving money capabilities of the project. Then again, much of the point of bitcoin cash would be that we have much more to go off of... There's also the question of whether the devs will ever have /free/ transactions or if anyone sees the utility of such a system too.

- https://hooktube.com/watch?v=UYHFrf5ci_g 

Blockstream crippled Bitcoin BTC with high fees, so that people will have to use the Lightning Network (a Blockstream project) for everyday transactions.

Result:  The Bilderberg Group, the Federal Reserve central bank, MasterCard, and traditional banking sector have taken over Bitcoin BTC, crippled it, to turn it into a currency system that they control & profit from.

Analysis:  Bitcoin BTC has been compromised.  Time to switch to another cryptocurrency.

Um how does what you just said make any sense? How is being on a chain any sort of centralization? Wouldn't that only make sense if the blockchain was stored and maintained in a central location?
"The point of view of BCH and satoshi is that there's no spam. All transactions are included in the blockchain because that's the economic freedom this is all about. 

(Except for a brief period at the beginning when the network was so frail it needed a 1MB limit just in case someone would want to scare it to shit, so it was in a way like a baby with diapers and pacifier. But the baby is a grown child now. And at least BCH is at last leaving the diapers and the pacifier behind by increasing the blocksize.)

The decision of not increasing the blocksize is what breaks BTC in many ways, making it extremely vulnerable to normal operations. They are choosing to ignore that, and their only justifications are resorting to extreme paranoia, and shift blame, ridiculous. The only doubt is if they are doing it by interest or by incompetence.

*IF* we believe there can be spam and it can be so 'powerful' against bitcoin, then the technology would not be so great of an idea, not so resilient, not so intelligent, it definitely would not be worth so much, it wouldn't be the *honey badger of money*, and in summary it would be fucking broken, like it is.

Satoshi designed the system taking into account situations like this. Bitcoin Core just keep ignoring that and everything that happens to them is of their own doing, because those are the effects of their decisions."
"Define ""spam."""
This person paid a lot of money to have the transactions included, they deserve it.
"Hey man, we agree with you. Bigger blocks might not be THE solution. But, it is THE solution today.

How can you have more merchant adoption, more users joining us, if you deliver a non-working product?

We need to scale NOW to TODAYS NEEDS. We don't need gb blocks today. Maybe we will never need them. Maybe we will add 2nd layer, maybe we will have bigger blocks, maybe we will invent t something revolutionary. We don't know.

What is important is to have a functioning product TODAY. And today, bigger blocks is the solution.

Edit: don't forget, a floppy disk from the 80's is 1.44mb big. Most web pages today are 3-5mb big. Where is the logic to keep 10min blocks at 1mb? The traffic you use in 10mins of normal browsing is exponentially bigger than 1mb."

Mining incentives are based on coin price.

To get the miners to swallow your poison you must sustain price until the poison has been fully ingested.

If you can set price this way it is quite expensive, but you can always profit later by dumping which is the death blow to the poisoned coin. Even if you lose some money on Bitcoin you're still making trillions running the fiat banking system that you've made safe by killing the disruptor."
"From their own wiki page:

The Lightning Network is a proposed solution to the bitcoin scalability problem. The network would use an off-chain protocol and is currently under development. It would feature a P2P system for making ...

Preview release: 1.0 RC / 6 December 2017; 11 days ago

Development status: Under development

Developer(s): Elements Project (Blockstream); Lightning Labs; ACINQ

Elements projects, the main dev team, is from BS. Lightning Labs is secondary dev team, not the main team.

Adam admitted on Twitter that all side chains are BS projects, created so BS can be the sole profiter of those side chains."
"A new coin would be a way to keep the p2p scenario available to the public.
If Satoshi wanted to increase the block there damn well better be records of this, hell I'm with Satoshi on this one.

Then again this civil war that's broken out could be the result of funding from both sides as the banking industry likes to do. Banks closing would represent that they are more on the defensive side to prevent a major loss.

Small blocks seem like a gain for miners, so all banks have to do is outspend the population to keep all miners on one coin by paying higher fees than the average joe, this would really be a direct attack as they incentivice miners which are to secure the network."
Because the development and repo is controlled by a different team.  Who are these big players funding Bitcoin Cash?  I'm not aware of any.

"If it is incompetence, it's caused by greed. With the high transaction fees, few people want to sell because they don't want to pay the transaction fees. So the price goes up, and it keeps going up because people see the price going up more, and want to get in on the action, so you have more and more people buying into it (even with high transaction fees) but few users want to sell. So the price keeps going up, and they think ""hey, the price keeps going up, it's not broken, so why fix it?"" 

BTC has been in a cycle like that for the last year. Possibly something has changed now with the rise of BCH, with the price way down on the highs from earlier this month. Many people who were HODLing are starting to flip to BCH, because BCH is much closer to the Bitcoin they originally got into back in 11, 12, 13."

"That’s a very good read, but the commenter is incorrect. A 51% attack is only valid for the duration of the attack, and at most can only double spend their coins. Once they stop the attack the network goes back to functioning normally. 

However, if you remove all non-mining full nodes, the attack vector increases substantially for a well funded attacker (maybe state actor) to attack and destroy the network. 

Basically by removing all non-mining peers from the network, you create a de facto Paypal that is taken down by a DOS attack from China or Russia. "
Maybe in storage, but definitely not bandwidth 
I think you might be underestimating how important non mining full nodes are to the stability of the network. 
"We are following Satoshi Scaling method see this;

Server farms: ""Long before the network gets anywhere near as large as that, it would be safe for users to use Simplified Payment Verification (section 8) to check for double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or about 12KB per day. Only people trying to create new coins would need to run network nodes. At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to specialists with server farms of specialized hardware. A server farm would only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with that one node.

*""The bandwidth might not be as prohibitive as you think. A typical transaction would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact). Each transaction has to be broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction. Visa processed 37 billion transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day.

That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or 2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices.*

""If the network were to get that big, it would take several years, and by then, sending 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a big deal.""

">The point of view of BCH and satoshi is that there's no spam. All transactions are included in the blockchain because that's the economic freedom this is all about.

Sure. And that's a wreckless view. All it takes is one megarich individual that doesn't like Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash or any simple blockchain storage to fill it up with shitty spam transactions. Being blasé about it opens you up to attacks and ends your currency. Bitcoin is under attack simply because far more people use it than Bitcoin Cash, but make no mistake: Bitcoin Cash is vulnerable to the same attack.

>The decision of not increasing the blocksize is what breaks BTC in many ways

When Bitcoin had a huge blocksize it was more vulnerable to spam storage; when Satoshi reduced the blocksize limit, it was still subject to spam attack, but at least it mitigated the damage of storing so much spam.

>we believe there can be spam and it can be so 'powerful' against bitcoin, then the technology would not be so great of an idea

There is spam but luckily it hasn't broken a currency... yet. For Bitcoin is has become slow and expensive. The exact thing could happen to Bitcoin Cash, and Bitcoin Cash would suffer more because it would store more spam per unit time. Basically blindly talking about blocksize doesn't defend against this attack. We need more intelligent solutions. That goes for Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash."

We can do 8x the amount of level of btc since we have 8MB blocks and BTC 1MB and next year we are upgrading to 32MB
No, always enough capacity is the plan
"No, if it reaches the same use level it will still have very low or free transaction fees, because it's 8x (easily expandable to 32x) larger, see http://txhighway.com 

Depending on how you measure it BCH already has larger volumes sometimes than BTC, because on BCH people are able to collect their dust again (putting together tiny balances like 0.00000123 into larger amounts). 

BTC has high fees because they imposed an unnecessary artificial limit on transaction throughput for no practical reason. It's an entirely self-inflicted wound. "

I'll bite, what's the central location the BCH blockchain is stored at?
I'm sick of answering this stupid question over and over again. Spam only becomes effective when blocks are almost full from true economic tx's, like at 995kB today. This is what we have seen in practice. Spam attacks only regularly started July 2015 when blocks started to be full. This is because attackers don't have to pay anything because the spam rolls off the mempool when it's never confirmed thus costing the attacker NOTHING. If instead the limit was removed, the spam WOULD be processed, the attacker would pay a minfee, and eventuality would go bankrupt if they try to sustain the attack. It would be like trying to fill a bottomless well with pennies. Attackers would hate that uncertainty of cost. Miners in the meantime would be enriched from the failed attacks.

"Unfortunately Bitcoin is under attack with spam transactions like these: https://twitter.com/JordanTuwiner/status/944736336396812294

Spam attacks are why Satoshi originally reduced the blocksize limit from around 32 MB down to 1 MB:

https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/a30b56ebe76ffff9f9cc8a6667186179413c6349

Spam attacks aren't going away any time soon and you don't wanna be storing just piles of shit on-chain. Simply increasing the blocksize limit just means that you are storing more shit on the blockchain. We need more intelligent solutions than blindly increasing blocksize."
"> what likelihood is there that the current extreme rise in price was pumped by them?

Unlikely. The biggest whales won't bet unless they're dead sure they won. Blockstream was an attempt. My guess that $18k+ price is a combination of hyped by futures and Coinbase Americans, Chinese Bitcoin industries and Japan/Korea positivity towards Bitcoin and maybe something of Tether. The rest of open blockchains' tokens are booming primarily cos Bitcoin Core is overloaded (it used to have 95%+ market share before overloads) - it's leaking all over the place

$600 bln is nothing in world's finances. Real whales are yet to come in

And Bitcoin Core semi-crashes aren't whales pulling out, just sped up wealth transfers to other tokens which started since overloads and happen iteratively. Bitcoin Cash is the fittest to pick up the slack in my estimation"

And in print:

[Digital Currency Group](http://dcg.co/who-we-are/) owns (in part) and directs [Blockstream](http://dcg.co/portfolio/) (go to ""B"" and look 13 down). Guess who runs Digital Currency Group:
 
1. Glenn Hutchins: Former Advisor to President Clinton. Hutchins sits on the board of **The Federal Reserve Bank of New York**, where he was reelected as a Class B director for a three-year term ending December 31, 2018.
 
2. Barry Silbert: CEO of Digital Currency Group, (**funded by Mastercard**) who is also an Ex investment Banker at Houlihan Lokey. This is the guy who thought SW2x was a good idea.
 
3. Lawrence H. Summers: ""Board Advisor""
""**Chief Economist at the World Bank from 1991 to 1993**. In 1993, Summers was appointed **Undersecretary for International Affairs of the United States Department of the Treasury under the Clinton Administration**. In 1995, he was promoted to **Deputy Secretary of the Treasury** under his long-time political mentor Robert Rubin. In 1999, he succeeded Rubin as **Secretary of the Treasury**. While working for the Clinton administration Summers played a leading role in the American response to the 1994 economic crisis in Mexico, the 1997 Asian financial crisis, and the Russian financial crisis. He was also **influential in the American advised privatization of the economies of the post-Soviet states [a massive FUD campaign that caused Russian citizens to sell their shares in public companies - these shares were purchased by Oligarch bankers with ties to Western Banks and most Russian people had their national resources stolen from them]**, and in the **deregulation of the U.S financial system, including the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act**.""
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Summers
 
4. Blythe Masters: ""Former executive at JPMorgan Chase.[1] She is currently the CEO of Digital Asset Holdings,[2] a financial technology firm developing distributed ledger technology for wholesale financial services.[3] Masters is **widely credited as the creator of the credit default swap as a financial instrument**. She is also Chairman of the Governing Board of the Linux Foundation’s open source Hyperledger Project, member of the **International Advisory Board of Santander Group**, and **Advisory Board Member of the US Chamber of Digital Commerce**.""
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blythe_Masters
 
DCG is also an investor in BitGo (See ""How it works""). See also: Money map
BitGo aims to become a ""service"" which prevents double spending. I thought Bitcoin had that built in. Well this service is only useful if transactions aren't being confirmed in the blockchain (rather, confirmed in, say, a side-chain, like Lightning--Blockstream's developing technology). Surprise, surprise. SegWit2x would literally take power out of the hands of the miners and gives it to central bankers and MasterCard. Interesting that after the decision to ""suspend"" (does not mean cancel) SegWit2x, Bitcoin gets held hostage by ridiculous transaction times.
 
edit: also worth watching this video from MasterCard before they invested in DCG. Notice this guy is just reading a damn script, too. Smh. Probably doesn't even know what he's saying.

"Interesting... Only 10 donations in December(with 2 still not confirmed, probably never will be), while getting at least 1 donation nearly every day during October(before the monster fees started appearing).

XMR is a fork of Bytecoin that had a clearer development path, and what do you know? The market preferred it. This is exactly what we're attempting to do with BCH, in fact; what's with your originalist claim?

>  Xmr doesnt scale and praises L2

XMR has dynamic blocksizes and have explicitly stated that while they're open to L2, they won't be depending on them for their scaling roadmap. In the next HF they'll be releasing a huge-ass on-chain scaling improvement to the protocol, in fact.

> Xmr devs are pro core/segshit

I've explicitly read XMR devs condemn the censorship, and speak about ""not wanting Monero to become like Bitcoin Core"". But since this is your claim, I'll put the burden of proof to source **your** claim first.

Actually I did, I replied to every counterpoint. You are showing your affiliation with this comment though, thanks.
no idea its origin but its in english with lots of content 
And this reduces the size and fees to* roughly 1/4.
I wasn't comparing anything to BTC. But since you did are there really that many nodes that aren't current on the BTC network?
It's interesting that LTC has double the transaction volume. But it's had 7 years of adoption to reach that point. BCH has been around just 4 months.

The best indication we have is node count. Last I looked a little less than half were on Alibaba servers based in China. Though we don't know who is using those servers it is likely that it is 1 major player. 
I'm not a blockstream expert but I assume it's VC money. I assume some banking-type people are funding blockstream in the hopes that they can work their way into centralizing Bitcoin. A huge threat to decentralized currency. If we believe in decentralized currency we should condemn efforts by anyone to turn Bitcoin into Paypal like BCH is trying to do. 
Have an invite to a site? I'm in need. 
Didn't TPB just complain a few months back about how much money they spent to consolidate the donations due to high TX fees? Or was that Wikileaks?
Bitcoiners are rich, they can send thousands in one output.
Not true, TPB has segwit. 😛

"That's not ""sauce"". Try and rebute some of the counterpoints on that thread, before going around sharing as if it were some sort of expose. It all amounts to bullshit, and some outright lies, lol."
I use xmr.  Never used btc or bch.
It doesn't reduce the size for resource requirements. Only with how transactions are calculated FYI. It would reduce costs, but in this environment, it doesn't mean a whole bunch.
I think that solves all the problems then.
Aye caramba! reduced by a quarter? $30 instead if $40. What a deal!
They spent some
I've gotten 2 piracy emails from downloading torrents from them recently so either my ISP suddenly cares for some reason or something changed with them.
I feel like BCH is where BTC was 3 years ago 
One + XMR fees is enough to stay away and wait for better fungibility of BCH. Fungibility is a scale, u only need so much of it

"It's clearly intentional though.

If they don't want to support Bitcoin Cash, they can just not put the name there. The decision that was made to include Bitcoin Cash in a mocking way (""bcash lol"") without even including an address to send money to. 

I'm not saying ""humiliate"" is 100% correct, but their aim is certainly malicious."
Well, bch is pro L2 as well. I'm going to ask on monero Reddit if they are pro segwit/blockstream
Can confirm. Look at my post history if interested. I give it less than 12 months for a fork to happen, because the situation will get unsustainable like what happened to bitcoin.
Pirate Bay is now irrelevant and we can let it die. 
"Well, it's christmas and I find you as the interested party wanting me to dig these for you a little bit lazy, with all due respect. Anyway, I pretty much have been doing nothing on reddit other than trying to educate the monero community regarding the fee issue. You can easily in <4 minutes find a lot of info lurking my posts.

I am very tired of this subject, and I am certain a fork will happen since the lead developer/merger/public person of monero is extremely close to blockstream, and behaves like blockstream people too.

By the way, he recently said blockstream guys he knows are nice people and only want bitcoin to succeed a few days ago. [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/7k704x/bitcoin_lightning_network_explained_does_this/drcgvbi/) you can take your own conclusions from there if you have been following the debacle of bitcoin core.

In short, as it's christmas and I am tired of this after months fighting to improve monero and only getting attacked, and you downvoted me even, monero is currently the second most expensive coin per average transaction. Naturally, only behind bitcoin core and its artificial problems. This is not a problem to the large part of the community and developers, so they fail to see/ignore the economic issue, like blockstream on bitcoin core. This happens in part due to the monero's average transaction size being very large since confidential transaction range proof (something needed to verify nobody creates coins out of thin air) but the main problem is that users are not able to freely choose their fee. The blocks are 99% of the time far from full! The argument is that if users were able to choose fees, then their transactions would stand out.

Now you wanna know what really does not add up? 1) ring size is freely able to be chosen (above 5), and this makes a transaction stand out much more easily than fee 2) the fee actually CAN BE CHOSEN, so long as pay more than the minimum 3) fluffypony's wallet site mymonero.com actually makes their transaction stand out since **only** they charge 0.02/0.026 fees instead of the low priority 0.0033 and standard 0.012 everyone has to choose. Monero can scale on chain. Monero should be able to embrace any technology that makes it scale better, as long as it does not force users to transact only on sidechains. This is exactly what is happening to bitcoin core and why bitcoincash had to appear. This is exactly what is going to happen to monero.

I find it extremely hypocritical of fluffypony when he says ""he doesn't like things being pushed forcibly to him"" but he's trying to push LN to us. [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/7k704x/bitcoin_lightning_network_explained_does_this/drcgvbi/) notice how on that very same post he says 2x was a stupid idea, so yeah we had to await for LN to fix the issue no matter how many years it is going to take without simply fixing it instantly by doubling the blocksize **while LN isn't available**

The **only** thing that appeared now (ironically proposed by blockstream and other cryptographers I have to be honest) is the bulletproof protocol that will make transaction size reduce by 80%, but you know what? I can bet the transaction fee will not reduce by 80%. Instead they will up the fee per byte to make it up for it. So, even if tx size decreases 82% the fee would for example decrease 30% so that LN (which does not even exist yet) can be kept being pushed on monero.

Now I will be downvoted and attacked after wasting a long time writing all of this, thus the reason I got tired of trying to help. Monero is the best coin and if chooses to walk bitcoin core's path I know it will just eventually be forked anyway."
yea its a fucking honeypot that's why
Joke on them.
Not that they have been relevant for years, but what a brilliant move to turn themselves even more irrelevant. Seriously, 10/10 business decision. WTG PB.
Can you provide the highlights? Asking to review one's every menial comment is a bit of a presumptuous thing, for someone making some bold claims.
Thanks, I'll look into it later. 
who even uses them lol talk about making yourself obsolete....
"Why would you donate to TPB? Like I get its where you pirate, but the site became kind of crappy in the last 6-10 years. Used to be full of anything you could ask for from old as hell games to brand new movies.


Now I rarely find anything Id WANT to download. "
You mean they won't take my money - Oh man, what a burn!
Dragons' den member? 
"TL;DR BCH: Bacsh. Lol"
Not a surprise. Pirate Bay is against centralized authority. BCH is a centrally-controlled currency by design. The 2 are philosophically incompatible. 
I see you get upvoted and I wonder what happened to skepticism on this sub. Can you source **anything** of what you're claiming?
Woah. There is a giant opportunity for competitors here
Consider [donating to the Internet Archive](https://archive.org/donate/bitcoin.php) instead.
Don't forget these are the same guys who secretly mined Monero using your browser.
Well, if they don't like money, that's their problem lol
This reflects poorly on them. Why bother? All this does is result in less donations for them. 
As a person who uses TPB a lot when torrenting games to decide whether to buy em or nah, what other sites are good? 
LUL!
That’s pretty funny, you guys needs to stop taking this all so seriously 😂 
lol
"Great job Pirate Bay!

I'll make sure and send them some money."
Maybe we should create a pirate version of the pirate bay that does what they do better and accepts bch?
"Does anybody still use TPB? My stance was always:
Give me good streaming for music and videos and I'll gladly pay for it. I still use some invite-only torrent trackers, but TBP is shit."
"thepiratebay.. LOL

Who cares?  It's their right to be trolls.  Fuck 'em.  I don't think I've used their site at all in the last 10 years anyway. They're irrelevant anyway.  Screw them
"
"The site is compromised, or it is run by some idiots trying to make BCH haters donate to them to support the trolling (clever!?).

Rutracker.ru has literally everything piratebay has, it is out of jurisdiction (can't be taken down or have FBI running it) and does not attempt to mine crypto using your browser (like piratebay does).

In sum, dead cat bounce attempt, nothing else."
Not a smart move tho 
It may be a sign that their site was compromised. Thinking about it for a while I realized that it happened several times so far...
"Merry Christmas!

Good luck accepting btc donations lol. There's a donation from a month and a half ago that's unconfirmed.

"Will Bitcoin Cash is a big threat to pirated products! When bitcoin cash will be accessible to almost all the people around the globe, maybe mostly they will purchase the genuine product instead of pirated products. Most people only download pirated product because some don't have access of visa and bank accounts.



the product company will create a blockchain that cannot be pirate or counterfeited :) did you know that piratebay hate blockchain? Find it for yourself..Blockchain is big threat to does pirates and they know it..."
"How can one disallow BCH donations?

They removed their Bitcoin addresses?"

"who cares?
struggle for 177 trillion dollar market. probably al the wars ever been waged for far less and ppl get all upset about very little."
"Less money for them. Let them choose Feecoin in peace :D

Merry Christmas!"
The brainwashing is real.  Economics will serve a hard lesson to those who can’t figure it out for themselves.   
"https://blockchain.info/address/129TQVAroeehD9fZpzK51NdZGQT4TqifbG

I happen to have a bot that monitors their uploads. For a few years now, every single new release or blockbuster that is uploaded is removed from their website. Makes you wonder...
[deleted]
I think it's run by some shitheads now, judging by the recent attempts to mine bitcoin in users' browsers... So no wonder.
"It looks like they do Blockstream coins exclusively: BTC, XMR, LTC

Should rename to ""The Blockstream Bay"""
That's the free market at work baby. They'll add a BCH address when they get their heads out of their ass. rarbg is better nowadays anyways.
As an outsider, all this infighting gives me an aversion to both BTC and BCH. There's just as much mud being thrown by both sides.
"If they don't want donations, I suppose it is entirely a ""Pirate Bay""-problem. Defo not a me-problem. LOL."
You will just be attacked/confronted by users with red letters next to their names displaying their superiority. Anyway, I mean xmr devs are pro layer 2 as main way to scale. There is no on chain scaling possibilities with xmr. Now try and explain what the fuck on chain mixers are for? Mixed settlements? Xmr is highfeecoin/failcoin 2.0. It's also likely it was designed to work as a honeypot anyway. 
[deleted]
Didn’t all the original people involved in the Pirate Bay get sent to prison? Who actually is operating that site anymore anyway?
True, let's focus about the positive aspects. Let these people do what they want, they will learn sooner or later.
Forget the tech! Why would you mock people who potentially want to donate money?
Extremely disappointed in what they are doing, particularly I would consider them tech savvy people and should have known better. In any case, the best form of revenge is massive success. Let's make Bitcoin Cash massive successful and focus on merchant adoption.
"Yep.  My thoughts 100% exactly.
"
Not holding any of those listed on their site. Don't see any reason for them to take sides though. Just making more enemies in a world with few friends. 
They accept Monero, so that's even better if you value privacy.   If I were to donate to Pirate Bay I would want to do so privately.
"**Isn't it fascinating that the Pirate Bay ends up [on the side of censorship](https://medium.com/@johnblocke/a-brief-and-incomplete-history-of-censorship-in-r-bitcoin-c85a290fe43)?**

Who runs that site these days, anyway?

They must have an awful lot of money already to just outright refuse money like that.

Since they have so much money already I suggest donating to any other, more worthy cause."
Blockstream controls XMR as well?  The fuck?
Wheres the humiliation? I only see a btc adress..
What do you use instead?  I struggle with alternatives.
Good luck receiving donations in BTC.
Less donations for them. People won't be sending BTC with high fees so let them learn the hard way.
"Merry Christmas! Not all of us are salty!

"I read a couple of years ago that TPB got a piddly $9 in bitcoin donations per day.  That was when transactions cost 2 cents.

http://uk.businessinsider.com/the-pirate-bay-only-gets-9-in-donations-a-day-2016-5

You can call bitcoiners a lot of things,  but generous isn't one of them."
They are worried about Chinese government control of Jihan Wu.  
"Humiliate? *Really?* Come on, people...

Besides, how much traction are you going to give this when their [their mobile page](https://m.thepiratebay.org) uses camel caps in ""BitCoin""?

The Bay is really losing their edge in tech. No reactive site. Separate mobile site. Design is showing its age. Search is getting more difficult instead of maturing. If they can't keep up with that when it's their main business, why would we expect them to keep up with any other latest tech?

"
"https://cashshuffle.com/

I appreciate your opinion on this."
Ppl can still send ltc and xmr too
Actually I'm sure they will get a lot more donations now from this publicity stunt. Bitcoin lovers will donate just because they are doing this.
"Not sure why this is downvoted.     
It's very true. Knowledge from research, experience, etc. is all way more important than using how two communities interact with each other to determine whether you support something.     
Keep in mind the people over at r/Bitcoin are the ones who stray away from this research, and decide with emotions.      
Let's imagine some doomsday  scenario for a moment, where BCH is the new #1, and has a lot of flaws, while a new #2 is rising. Do you want to be the person who decides using emotions, and sticks with the failing system, or do you want to be part of the group who researched and thought logically, who realised the #2 would overtake the broken system?  "
That’s a very good point. I’m sticking with BCH because I can actually use it to buy things. 
Sentiment plays a large role in all crypto's success and growth rates.
"There is no mystery in that!
"
"Hmm. Good point. It's probably because those in controll of btc are influenced by bankers now.  So they act like them.

I posted in North Koreal reddit when i was new. I noticed they acted like bankers and snobby.  And they told me to get out of crypto. 

Im happy for the r/btc community. Very friendly. "
That means we are on the right side.
How about you base your opinions of a coin on the objective pros and cons rather than the attitudes of what amounts to a fan base?
Dang, good call! It's so true.
