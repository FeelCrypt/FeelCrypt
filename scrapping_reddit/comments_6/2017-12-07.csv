"Sorry I don't really understand what you're asking. I should probably clarify that I am NOT in favor of cryptos.

Not sure what you mean by ""fixing deflation"". Do you mean how would you pay? If the crypto deflates enough, I guess you could create a fork that's of a lower denomination."
"I mean that it's much more convenient to pay in money that fluctuates very little compared to something that fluctuates a lot.

"
But the point is we at least have the option to carry cash.
I would never use such a system. It's bad enough now that we are forced to use this worthless fiat monopoly money, but at least they can't confiscate your cash or remove your ability to use it (even though they steal from us by devaluating said cash with inflation). 
Was all good until the last paragraph about leaving steam because of btc
"Yeah sure that's the point if you're a dreamer.

But the reality is that bitcoin isn't recognized as a currency except by specific services that will essentially cash out your bitcoin and pay whoever you're trying to pay.

If I'm Steam why would I ever accept bitcoin when all of the things I want to buy can't be purchased with bitcoin and must first be turned into a legitimate currency?

Not to mention the fact that if I'm Steam there's virtually no reason for me to accept Bitcoin itself as a payment option because my revenue sees almost no relevant increase if I do."
"Sounds like something, that someone would say, who invested in a coin and then a few years later had to change their mind about, what it is to be peer to peer digital currency.

"These ""whale hoarders"" havent done anything wrong. It is the free market. If they want to buy an asset they can do so. If they want to sell it, they can do so as well. They can only dump their coins once. As time goes by, if people adopt bitcoin and are paid in bitcoin, the coin distribution will be much more level and the volatility in the price will be reduced greatly. These are growing pains right now
"
"The issue you are talking about is more for companies that want to engage in speculative activities. Most companies today (like Steam) aren’t interested in playing that game.

A typical US based retail company would more than likely convert to USD immediately and record it as such on their financial statements at the time of transaction. They must also account for the gain or loss from foreign currency transactions (which Bitcoin is) that occurred as a result of exchange rate fluctuations between the time the sale was recorded and payment was received, modern accounting systems automatically do this for established currencies and it’s usually relatively small fluctuations (per transaction) due to price stability. Not the case with Bitcoin.

"You are assuming the currency will be growing 10,000%. This is unrealistic. If a currency became widely adopted, everyone would be transacting in it for all purchases. The value would only increase as much as society value increases as well.

Another point, If everyone was using the deflationary currency, you wouldn't be measuring value in another currency's units either. You would be talking about the dollar value of pizza, you would be talking about how many bits instead."

"Don't listen to these keynesians and their horror stories of the deflationary boogeyman. We used commodities as money for thousands of years, gold and silver, which essentially have fixed supply.

Their argument of ""no one would be willing to spend money because it is going to be more valuable"" is bullshit. If that were true, then people wouldn't be buying new electronics today as they could get them in 6 months or a year for cheaper. People will still spend money, they just will be making a conscious choice that it may be more valuable in the future so they might not be spending wastefully. When you have an inflationary currency, people will try to exit that currency as soon as possible. This leads to malinvestment and bubbles in asset classes. People are being forced to spend their currency for fear that it will be worth less and less each passing moment. That is not the type of money that rational people choose to use. It is the type of money that an authoritarian government will force you to use."
I'm not a trader, I think that's a gamble really. I could just as easily sell now and the price will rally tomorrow.
Yeah, but your clarification is kinda beside the point. It’s implied that one wouldn’t sell for negligible profits under normal circumstances.

Yeah, BTC isn't a usable currency for typical transactions due to its exorbitant fees, so what use does it have? Yet the price keeps going up. There's no question that it's a bubble due to speculation. I don't think I've ever seen such an obvious foreshadowing of an impending BTC crash.
"> It's not even finished yet and you're calling it broken.

"Not OP, but can help -

Currency ultimately is a tool for exchanging stuff that's hard to exchange. I want my house painted today, you want five massages next month. Those might be equal value right now, but it's a lot easier if I can just hand you $100 and then you can hand me back $20 five times.

Money supply increasing is generally good because it incentives you to use it. If I gave you a dollar and told you that you had to give me 1 cent a day until you were out of money, you'd go spend it today, not wait ten weeks until you only have 30 cents left. Inflation is less severe, but the same idea.

Deflationary currency has the problem that once someone has money, they don't want to spend it, and it's really really hard to convince them to spend it. In that situation, I buy that house painting and you never buy the massages from me. Now the town just has $100 less money going around, and money gets even more valuable, because even fewer people are spending money, so money gets more valuable.....

Currency management is largely about making sure money is growing a little, but not a looooot and definitely not shrinking.

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies generally take the position that money management is bad, and are built to 'avoid manipulation'. The problem is, that doesn't actually make them difficult to manipulate. In fact, it makes it impossible to PREVENT manipulation.

If someone tried to do with the dollar what is happening with bitcoin right now, the government could just print more, and once the person manipulating it gives up, they could take the excess back out of circulation. But nobody can make more bitcoin - at least not very quickly at all. So there's nothing anyone can do if someone manipulates it."

"Maybe I didn't word what I meant to say correctly but wtf are you talking about? 

I'm saying if I had Bitcoin and it was increasing in value rapidly I'd probably still spend some of it while keeping some in savings to grow, or burst.. 

I haven't been investing in cryptocurrency, but I have followed the Bitcoin over the last 5 years, unfortunately more recently than in the past but alas.. 

I see why you would want my business, but I guess my thinking was, if someone is willing to part with a thing that only becomes more valuable the longer you hold it (temporarily) as I doubt the btc keeps going up and never down again, I'd probably rather be taking that currency than refusing it.

Idk now that I'm not also at work and I'm thinking this out, I can see where it's not really a good move for a business to accept them.

 At the same time I think if I had say, paid for $100 of btc early on, and left it alone until now, I'd have way more. Duh. There's products I want that can be bought with btc and you even usually get a sweet discount. I'd be really psyched right now to spend some btc assuming I bought in and my 100 bucks was now worth, idk $1000+ at this point? 

I'd absolutely use them sparingly but damn if there's not stuff I'd be buying if I had btc from buying in cheap. Even buying in high I think I'd be spending at this point I'm not confident that it's gonna stay above 10k, but I don't think I know anything so if I'm totally off base with my thinking, I wouldn't mind constructive criticism. I would like to get a better understanding of the cryptocurrency market, especially if I come off as knowing nothing bout nothing. "

Yeah it's all on record but it's more like a cash exchange where you need to know the code for the transaction or else you can't trace it and that code is something that only the two people making the transaction should have access to. So they can tell others about it and then they can check which I guess is good for court but realistically I can't just go into some block chain and find some transaction you made buying a pound of weed from Canada without something else to go on. The problem up until now was that it was very hard to get money onto the internet without first going through a bank because companies really only accept credit or debit cards and sometimes bank wires. So buying drugs when your bank has a record of every transaction that courts can then demand from the bank isn't a super safe way to do things. This lead to the stolen credit/debit card market since you essentially had to impersonate someone else and pray they didnt trace it back to you. So yeah it can be traced but it's value comes from the fact that it can only be traced if one of the two party members wants it to be, or I guess if someone put a virus on your computer to track it. Or I should say initial value as the value that bitcoin currently has is way more than it should be for some drug currency, which was my whole point anyway.

"> BTC, unlike fiat currencies under control of central authorities, does not have any inherent stabilizing features

I believe this to be incorrect.  since its adoption is limited by the number of humans on the planet and the total amount of wealth needed to be represented, it naturally reaches a state where it can no longer be adopted exponentially, at which point we would expect its price (perceived value) to stabilize.

Perhaps BTC isn't the crypto which is ultimately mass-adopted.  There are so many competing cryptos out there, it's very hard to predict.  Maybe it will be Bitcoin Cash, maybe Monero.

You seem to be well informed.  You're looking at this from the supply side and that's a great start.  Let's look at the demand side.

Tell me, if an opt-in money *wasn't* deflationary, why would anyone want to possess it in the first place?

And provided that there is an opt-in deflationary money, why wouldn't some people prefer to hold onto some of it, instead of holding onto money which is guaranteed to lose value by design?

> That's not going to change. Quote me on that. Come back in the future and enjoy your ""I told you so"" if BTC ever amounts to anything (it won't).

I first heard that in 2011.   Since then cryptocurrency has only grown in adoption.  It is still very marginal: I expect global crypto adoption to require generations of humans and possibly some wars unfortunately.  But as long as people foresee a future in it, then they will continue to devote additional wealth to it.  And as long as it is super-easy and cheap to transact (definitely not always the case, see my earlier points) then sooner or later people heavy in it will want to spend it.  And there will be others eager to accept it in exchange, because it will be widely understood to have value."

"> BCore devs are essentially committing suicide because ""gigabyte blocks are unfeasible."" Well, okay. But that doesn't mean 32MB is unfeasible. Or 8MB. Or even just 2MB.

Each one of those options gives more power to people who aren't holding the majority of BCore coins, and stabilizes the cost of the coin. 

The people who are holding the majority of coins don't want people other than themselves to have power, because they won't see insane speculative returns on their ""investment"". 

BCore wants the coin to be an investment. It's a get-rich-quick scheme. They'll never be convinced otherwise. Right now it works, because there's an endless number of rubes entering the system as the price hype-train continues to grow exponentially. 

The minute a non-trivial number of people attempt to realise those gains, though... the entire thing will collapse in hours.

Change never comes until it's too late and it's forced upon us. Bitcoin is unusable as a currency, but because all the new people got into it because of the hype, that doesn't even matter to them. So maybe it will just keep rising for a long time... and these people will cash out with a profit and pat themselves on the back. But someone, some group of people will get the timing wrong, and it will plummet for them.

 I think it will take another, better crypto to become the new 'useful' digital currency, with mass media hype and a price rise itself, before BTC really collapses and the new buyers realise BTC is slow and pointless as a day to day currency, like it was originally intended to be. It might take so long for this to happen that they are conditioned into thinking BTC is how crypto is supposed to be, a speculative investment for life, that is inconvenient to use, just like online now no one cares that 18 months of browsing history is kept on a GCHQ server. 'Nothing to hide, nothing to fear' and all of the problems that come from that line of thinking. We've been conditioned to think that it's acceptable for a government to do that without any asking or public debate, for 'national security'. 

Maybe the next generation of people won't even think it's an issue that crypto is slow, heavily regulated and centralised on sidechains. They bought BTC and it went up, and now they can finally spend it. Fuck man, who knows what's going to happen. Strap in!"

Customers make many small payments.  These small payments clutter up the merchant's wallet.  When the time comes to pay bills or to consolidate his wallet, the  merchant will pay a large fee.  The fee will depend on the number of custo er payments received, not the total amount of fees.  Many small payments will be expensive for the merchant to process.
I don't disagree at all, I'm just stating what we're all seeing happen. 
Institutional hedge-fund level money is pouring in now, probably sovereign wealth funds as well. This is just the beginning. The only thing keeping it from spiking higher and faster is the limited channels to pour in huge levels of capital that are sitting on the sidelines.
It's the same from a purely economic perspective, but many studies in behavioral economics show that people don't act purely rationally when it comes to money, and in fact often act completely *irrationally*. People just don't act that way in practice. BTCs rapid appreciation makes people not want to spend it, even on things they are just buying with USD that they could have bought BTC with.

"> I believe this to be incorrect. since its adoption is limited by the number of humans on the planet and the total amount of wealth needed to be represented, it naturally reaches a state where it can no longer be adopted exponentially, at which point we would expect its price (perceived value) to stabilize.

This is not an **inherent** stabilizing feature.

This is stabilization based on adoption.

You're still caught in the same problem where no major retailer adopts currency because it isn't stable, and the currency requires adoption to achieve stability, so therefore it never reaches stability.

>Tell me, if an opt-in money wasn't deflationary, why would anyone want to possess it in the first place?

To spend it. Cryptocurrencies provide secure international transactions at no cost. There is no middle-man bank that collects wire fees. People would happily use an inflationary cryptocurrency for this alone.

Seriously, how is this even a question?

The problem is that the deflationary nature of BTC *disincentivizes* spending, and that means BTC fails at literally the #1 function of a currency.

>And provided that there is an opt-in deflationary money, why wouldn't some people prefer to hold onto some of it, instead of holding onto money which is guaranteed to lose value by design?

Sure, they might prefer that.

But what you're describing here is not a currency. It's an *investment device*.

>I first heard that in 2011. Since then cryptocurrency has only grown in adoption.

**As an investment device.**

Do you understand the distinction?

People don't buy BTC to spend it. People buy BTC to park their money and profit from the speculative booms.

It's a nice speculative investment device. It is not, however, a currency. And it will never become a currency, because it has no *inherent* stabilizing features that are necessary to promote retail adoption. There is nothing there to trigger the positive feedback loop, so it is caught up in a negative one instead."

This is also *more* in line with Gresham's law than than not spending Bitcoin, because you get rid of fiat as soon as you receive it.

Uh yes it is.  it grows until it saturates.  like any tech adoption / saturation curve.

There's always cost at the intersection of fiat and crypto.  So you have to pay the cost to get the crypto to send for free.

Cryptocurrencies only ""provide secure international transactions at no cost"" if you were *already holding them anyway.*

Get it??

> There is nothing there to trigger the positive feedback loop, so it is caught up in a negative one instead.

I do not see a negative adoption feedback loop represented [here](https://bitcoinwisdom.com/markets/bitstamp/btcusd) over any significant time period, adoption only seems to go up.

It might one day become caught in a negative adoption feedback loop but I can't find any evidence of that.  You'll need evidence if you want to keep making assertions like that.  It's fairly demonstrable that over time, more and more people hold more and more crypto.

Yes, as a speculative investment device.   It's still in the speculative phase.  Of course I understand the distinction, I've held crypto for many years, and spent very few of them.  That's because it's rather obvious to me that its incredibly undervalued.  There are many reasons to believe that a global cryptocurrency will in fact become the next ""reserve currency.""  Will that be Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash or Ethereum or some other?  No way to know for sure.  Sooner or later, one of these will however hit the magic formula, and adoption will look exactly like that chart I just showed you, because all cryptos get adopted in hype cycles like Bitcoin.

> People buy BTC to park their money and profit from the speculative booms.

Yes, more and more people do this.  Eventually, almost anyone investing money is doing at least some of this, if only as a hedge.  And eventually when enough people are doing this, then over time the risk and reward will go down, and the variability will go down, and people will see it less as a get-rich-quick scheme and more as a sensible long term thing to hold.

And when enough people are heavy in crypto they'll want to spend them, like I enjoy spending mine, and they'll seek out ways to do that.  And as this crypto becomes globally recognized and desired, merchants will offer discounts to get it, because it costs less to transact and hold.

Traders buy and sell.  You seem focused on these.  But with every wave of adoption there are more people that buy and hold.  These are not boom speculators.  What causes these people to stop buying and holding?

I guess lastly: why are you in this sub to begin with :)"

"Every traded item has variable value, whether it’s a physical good, a service, a stock, a bond, a currency, etc.

That’s not the issue.

The issue is that in order to function well, currency has to have a *relatively stable value*, *high adoption,* *high scalability*, and *very high transactional volume.*

Bitcoin currently has none of these. What it has instead is a rapidly increasing value, low adoption, limited scalability, and very low transactional volume, just like a penny stock in a bubble before it bursts.

That’s why Bitcoin is about to fail unless they can somehow magically address all of these issues right the fuck now."
"Literally everything you said about how ""BTC should do this and that if such and such happens"" is the same ridiculous fantasy that BTC apologists have been saying since its inception.

BTC will not be ""sufficiently adopted"" until major businesses are convinced that its value with respect to other assets has permanently stabilized. And its value with respect to other assets will not stabilize unless it is ""sufficiently adopted"". 

It's caught in a vicious cycle because BTC, unlike fiat currencies under control of central authorities, does not have any inherent stabilizing features. There are no monetary levers that a government can pull to combat volatility. It is entirely at the mercy of speculation, which is why it is stuck in this limbo of never becoming a legitimate currency ever.

That's not going to change. Quote me on that. Come back in the future and enjoy your ""I told you so"" if BTC ever amounts to anything (it won't)."

I don't think it would be the accounting that is the issue here but rather the fact you would need a consultant to determine if you should cash out the bitcoins and when. A lot of opportunity cost and stuff like that with holding a currency like bitcoin.
If you read the steam announcement, it mentions transaction fees being absurdly high, and BTC being so volatile. Sometimes they get more money, so they have to issue a partial refund, sometimes they get less, so they have to serve another invoice for the remaining funds.

"Deflation is bad for borrowers, but good for savers. So in a consumerist economy like we have in the western world, people would not be able to run up debts purchasing useless consumer goods. They wouldn't be able to pay back the debts.

"
That's because most economies use fractional-reserve debt money.
"Believe me, I am a big fan of blockchain tech and am very bullish on it's adoption into many industries. What I am not a fan of is speculative bubbles. Here are my thoughts:
Bitcoins have value due to the ability to trade them. They gain inherent value when more people use them. More people use them when it has a stable price. Speculation makes people who want to use it as a currency, very uneasy, hence why steam is not supporting bitcoin payments anymore. People who use it as a currency, sell it to avoid volatile prices, the people who buy are speculators. The current trajectory of bit coin makes it into a speculative medium where most bitcoins are owned by people trying to make money and not actually use it. When the drop happens, there will be less and less people using bitcoins as currency and it's inherent value will be pretty small. What rises in it's ashes may be a stabler currency, but by them an alt coin will probably take the lime light as the next hot thing. Also by that time, block chain trading of country currencies will probably be a thing.  "
The only correct choice is not to buy at all.

"> he world has played around with decentralized limited-supply currencies before. It was called the gold standard

I thought the gold standard was the start of fractional reserve banking? ie gold became paper money, and then it was realised that they could print more paper money without people actually claiming the gold. 

Bitcoin acts nothing like this....
From the wiki article 'Gold Standard'

Disadvantages
-
The unequal distribution of gold deposits makes the gold standard more advantageous for those countries that produce gold. - **Not an issue for crypto. Anyone can mine.**

Some economists believe that the gold standard acts as a limit on economic growth.""As an economy's productive capacity grows, then so should its money supply. Because a gold standard requires that money be backed in the metal, then the scarcity of the metal constrains the ability of the economy to produce more capital and grow."" - **not sure how this applies when BTC or any crypto could be infinitely divided up mathematically.**

The rest of the points seem to centre around money as debt, which is exactly what bitcoin and crypto aims to avoid. I'm not saying I don't believe what you're saying, I just can't see it yet. Can you help me understand? I don't see how money made from IOUs of gold, that add up to more than the total of real gold, is a limited-supply.
"
"> Use the bitcoin then immediately buy the bitcoin back with the easily acquired country currency. No money lost except for small amount of transaction fee.

Or just use the regular money and pay no fee and don't go through a ridiculous multi-step process just to pay for something.

It will never end with anything other than a burst.   I guarantee it.
True, but it always has been. After this bubble there will be another one even bigger etc... it has been like that since 2010.
Hmm. I had heard of this - any recommendations?
And Ethereum is better than both because it can also provide a service while being a currency and store of value
I wasn't quite asking for an ELI5, just pointing out that the previous comment was a big fail. Thanks for putting one out there though.
As a holder and believer in Ethereum I can’t wait for BTC to fall and be replaced
As bitcoin has grown from $0.01 to $14,000 the volatility has decreased. When the market cap is big enough, say as big as gold, the volatility will be similar as well. It is only during this initial growth phase where there is high volatility. How is bitcoin ever supposed to get to this large market cap if it isn't for these speculative bubbles? If you look at the history of bitcoin, it has had these bubbles over and over again. It will continue to do this until it is either replaced by a different cryptocurrency, or until the market is fully saturated and the market cap is sufficient to allow all trade.
"> Thats why BTC is not a good currency... Nobody wants to spend it.

There might be an interesting analogy to metal-based currencies of the past. Whenever a government (e.g. Rome) started reducing the silver/gold content of its coinage, the previous coins would quickly disappear from circulation as people hoarded them and spent only the cheaper coins whenever possible.

What that means for Bitcoin, I'm not sure. Maybe people will start spending it once there are vendors that *only* take Bitcoin."
"> Deflation is bad for borrowers

Thus interest rates are invented.  In an inflationary economy, borrowers pay back slightly more than they borrowed. In a deflationary economy, borrowers pay back slightly less than they borrowed. It all works out in the end.

I could pay you in Venezuelan dollars, which are rapidly going down in value. If I paid you $100(US) equivalent, next week it might be worth $50(US)

Or I could pay you in Bitcoin, which is rapidly going up in value. If I paid you $100(US) equivalent, next week it might be worth $150(US).

Which would you prefer to be paid in?

Obviously this is an extreme example.

The real reason to avoid Bitcoin isn't because it is appreciating, it's instability and risk. Because the biggest fear is that the money or investment you are holding is suddenly worth much less, people avoid anything prone to rapid fluctuations in value or boom/bust cycles -- like Bitcoin.

Right now it might be a moon rocket, but if the bubble bursts next week and the value drops in half or less, Steam doesn't want to be holding a bunch of Bitcoin and still need to pay publishers twice as much as they're worth in dollars. If the increase in value were slower or relatively stable, they'd be happy to take it."

Honest answer: money was backed by gold for decades, then silver, but since about 1970 it has been backed by nothing at all except a government ""promise"" that it has value.  A promise that has been broken, as you can see from inflation rates since that time.

The appeal of digital money like bitcoin is that the supply is determined by a mathematical formula and central authorities cannot simply create new ""money"" arbitrarily and dilute the value of existing money."

But yes, I'm not trying to be obtuse, b/c I get what you mean. So w/ the colloquial understanding in mine, BTC *does* have intrinsic value, as it's pseudo-anonymity and blockchain tech are incredibly valuable.

It's not. 
No I mean with it being speculative. The market cap tells you more about how over inflated the price is than the single units of currency.
"you want transactions *processed* in your country, easy: subsidize mining.  China seems to have figured that out long ago.

you want to *censor* transactions, you're going to have a hard time with that unless you can direct 51% of the hashpower.  So I guess the USG needs to buy a lot of miners.  but even then, China can't do it undetected, and when it's detected, then all of their miners instantly turn into very inefficient space heaters."
Oh, sorry, I misunderstood. After rereading it became clear you were talking about currency, not gold.
I agree, although I never said that it would be easy, or that even Bitcoin is slightly stable. It isn't. It's entirely speculation, not an official form of currency or payment, and isn't backed by anything trusted. There will be drops, and there will be a crash. Whether or not it will disappear, I couldn't tell you.
"Because a currency isn't valued by how much is put into it by consumer assets or people's investments, its value is based on other currencies and the countries economy, and banks that are backing it (and also backed by other things themselves). Think of it like a very well built house of cards. It ensures, that way, that at the slightest sign of hesitation or failure, that a currency doesn't just collapse and cause a whole country to go up in ruin overnight.

To the point that nearly every major country has a central national bank that isn't for day to day loans and accounts like banks are, that is there as a ""failsafe"" in case banks fall short on their amounts or interest rates or overnight payments, etc. And basically pays the deficit so things like inflation, interest rates, currency strength, etc. Don't start changing drastically.

€: Just to be clear, here, there is *some* value put into currency through investments. I.e. Forex. It's just not navigated or treated as, say, a stock would or a corporation. The influence on a currencies well being via investments is minimal, and treated to be a lot less than what it would be through other investments. Reason for that is no one wants currencies to be backed and invested upon, solely on people's investment's and buying power, versus leaving it in the hands of the financial system and mortgaged backed securities, or banks."

"> a currency that penalizes spending (which is literally the #1 function of a currency) is not actually a currency

I can see no way in which BTC penalizes spending *in the long term* provided that the fees to perform ""spending-type"" transactions are ""spending-type"" costs.

Yes it is deflationary, which is why we would expect it to eventually adopt a sigmoid adoption curve like all globally-adopted technologies, at which point its value WRT other assets should stabilize.

>  none of this stuff is ever going to become anything more than a speculative ""investment"" device.

until sufficiently adopted"
The most ironic thing here is that Eth is actually going all-in on tons of different scaling options that can work together, whereas Bitcoin is floundering to implement a single one. Yet, because Ethereum processes so many more transactions than Bitcoin between all of its dApps (including cryptokitties), it looks like it's equally bad at fast transactions.
Granted iota's future scaling seems quite bright in regards to infinite scalability without the consistent miner pool. 
"While we can’t say scaling as a whole has been a success, its at least understood in other currencies that scaling is necessary. It’s also being more widely tested. 

Bitcoin has degenerated into a community that wants to remain small and exclusive. "
eth network did more TX today than all other blockchain combined. hard to say it scales any worse than the competition 
"Yeah, for different things. Silver is used when it can be fully enclosed by another material, and copper is used when you don't need a great conductor. But when you need a highly conductive material that's exposed to air (such as in various connector pins) then gold is your only option.

"You need more {HDD space/CPU power/bandwidth} to {store/verify/download} each block. The core devs consider it important that a computer than can do that today should be able to do that just as well 20 years from now.

They consider the most important part of ""decentralized peer-to-peer digital money"" to be the decentralized part (unless you're talking about decentralizing development and code) and think that increasing the technology cost to {store/verify/download} will cause Bitcoin to become centralized."
Increasing the blocksize makes the cost of running a full node (i.e. mining) more expensive because it takes more bandwidth, more storage space, and more processing power to run the servers.  This might cause some smaller mining operations to stop mining, which results in a less decentralized network, which is more prone to attack or takeover.  In theory... 
but futures trading!

"Bitcoin needs an upgrade to allow for more transactions per second. There was/is an extremely wide-ranging propaganda and information-control conspiracy, centering around the company Blockstream and the /r/bitcoin mod /u/theymos, to prevent this upgrade from occurring.

There's no real discussion of what the motive behind this information control is, or what any of it has to do with BTC's rapid value increase, but I guess the implication is that these conspirators are likely manipulating Bitcoin markets in any way that they can and at the expense of its usability as a currency."
I always thought of it the opposite way: RBF is the justification for not scaling the block size, which results in network congestion and thus high fees.

"**Octopus card**

The Octopus card (Chinese: 八達通) is a reusable contactless stored value smart card for making electronic payments in online or offline systems in Hong Kong. Launched in September 1997 to collect fares for the territory's mass transit system, the Octopus card system is the second contactless smart card system in the world, after the Korean Upass, and has since grown into a widely used payment system for all public transport in Hong Kong, leading to the development of Oyster Card in London.

The Octopus card has also grown to be used for payment in many retail shops in Hong Kong, from convenience stores, supermarkets, fast-food restaurants, on-street parking meters, car parks, to other point-of-sale applications such as service stations and vending machines.

The Octopus card won the Chairman's Award of the World Information Technology and Services Alliance's 2006 Global IT Excellence Award for, among other things, being the world's leading complex automatic fare collection and contactless smartcard payment system.

Maybe steamcoin can become more mainstream, but my opinion is that in general, once cryptocurrency reaches mass adoption, businesses will only accept the two main cryptocurrencies (because more than that wouldn't be worth the additional effort). For example, most businesses accept MasterCard and Visa, but American Express support is much more rare. If steamcoin becomes one of the main ones, then I could see it being adopted by other businesses, but otherwise it will be used for a niche market.

"The whole point of a central bank controlling the monetary supply is supposedly to help borrowers so that the economy can always keep going. If you borrow money (which thanks to US consumer culture pretty much everyone has some agreement to pay x amount of dollars in the future with a lender) inflation helps you because what you pay in the future is less than what you agreed to borrow.

I don't think there's some sinister plot to steal from the people by inflating the currency, I think that the idea is intrinsically flawed and big banks ultimately end up winning. You only have to look at the housing crisis in 07-08 to find an example of the central banks policy creating a bubble which banks knowingly abused and mostly came out winning."

Because the idea is the adoption continues down the scope, such that if steam accepts it, steam then may be able to use it to purchase its OWN services such as CDN space, server space, developers, etc.  And this would in theory continue down the line where everyone could trade and make use of it with as little fiat conversion as possible.  Then it becomes more efficient.

"**Civil forfeiture in the United States**

Civil forfeiture in the United States, also called civil asset forfeiture or civil judicial forfeiture or occasionally civil seizure, is a controversial legal process in which law enforcement officers take assets from persons suspected of involvement with crime or illegal activity without necessarily charging the owners with wrongdoing. While civil procedure, as opposed to criminal procedure, generally involves a dispute between two private citizens, civil forfeiture involves a dispute between law enforcement and property such as a pile of cash or a house or a boat, such that the thing is suspected of being involved in a crime. To get back the seized property, owners must prove it was not involved in criminal activity. Sometimes it can mean a threat to seize property as well as the act of seizure itself.

With bitcoin, I have the known pseudo anonymity because it was widely publicized as an untraceable, anonymous currency that was safe to buy drugs with when it was first created. So we know its 'anonymous' -- we can trace transactions through the blockchain but cannot map who or what is in control of the wallets at teh destinations. Anyone could have a million wallets or 1; but we cannot be sure. Therefore, given that many people think higher transactions is better for bitcoin, I would definitely create a bot army to continuously create new wallets, dump random BTC into them, and continue on AND NOBODY WOULD KNOW IF THEY WERE BOTS OR PEOPLE.

It has to have some value proposition over the existing options. For Bitcoin up to the blocks filling up there were considerable gains in usability over existing options in many areas.

Black and grey markets are another and are still mostly Bitcoin or cash (USD, not BCH) land. Other coins have better features but none have BTC's network effect yet.

Likewise to the black market uses, bitcoin's pseudonymous nature gives it an edge in many sectors where people may not want it known that they're transacting. If you don't want your porn subscription showing up on your bank statement then something like bitcoin is very attractive. Essentially anything that you'd prefer to use cash for over a credit card if you were physically present is a use case for something with properties like Bitcoin that can be exchanged with some level of identity protection and without needing to use a third party."

"You completely misunderstand what we're discussing here.

To borrow terminology from the redditor I responded, the ""Lightning Network"" is trying to address the issue of ""vertical"" scalability. It is essentially just layering some abstraction on top of BTC to address a network bottleneck problem. This is nothing. This is small time. It's just a band-aid. It does nothing to solve the core fundamental ideological problem that dooms BTC to failure.

What he and I are trying to argue, and agree on, is that ideological problem -- ""horizontal"" scalability. That is, the money supply is finite, and therefore the currency is inherently *deflationary*. This promotes hoarding and saving, and penalizes spending. And a currency that penalizes spending (which is literally the #1 function of a currency) is not actually a currency.

The Lightning Network does nothing to address that problem. They can add a bazillion abstraction layers to this, and BTC (and any secondary or tertiary currency based on the BTC) is still going to be deflationary in nature. Consequently, none of this stuff is ever going to become anything more than a speculative ""investment"" device."
">The unequal distribution of gold deposits makes the gold standard more advantageous for those countries that produce gold. - Not an issue for crypto. Anyone can mine.

It doesn't matter that anyone can mine when the total amount of BTC available to be mined is a limited, finite quantity. Consequently, BTC is *deflationary* in nature, which promotes hoarding/saving rather than spending. And that inherently takes a big steaming dump on the most important function that a *currency* needs to perform.

>Some economists believe that the gold standard acts as a limit on economic growth.""As an economy's productive capacity grows, then so should its money supply. Because a gold standard requires that money be backed in the metal, then the scarcity of the metal constrains the ability of the economy to produce more capital and grow."" - not sure how this applies when BTC or any crypto could be infinitely divided up mathematically.

A paper currency that is gold backed is equally as infinitely divisible as BTC is. After all, there is nothing stopping the US government from stamping new coins or printing new paper that has smaller denominations than 1 cent. In fact this was one of the key reasons why the world transitioned into paper notes that were backed by precious metals. The notes could be any denomination necessary, while still being indexed to a finite commodity. That didn't stop the gold standard from being depressive on economic growth.

Ultimately, the limit on economic growth is a function of the penalty that *deflationary* currencies place on spending.  This is unavoidable. It's very basic economics. And it's why deflationary currencies can't actually be useful currencies.

I really want to stress this point: BTC is not a currency. It never was, and it never will be. It has lived its entire existence as a wildly speculative ""investment"" device. People don't buy BTC in order to spend it. They buy it to hold, and profit from the speculative booms."

I don't consider BTC to be thriving.  When less and less places are accepting it as a payment method, that is not thriving.

It's the volatility that is scaring merchants from accepting it. Imagine acquiring. Say $100,000 worth of BTC over the course of a year. It's possible that value increases intrinsically if BTC value increases, but what if it doesn't? What if it decreases by 25%? Then they're losing profit margin simply because the currency isn't stable. Their point about transaction fees is also incredibly justified, both as a recipient or refunder. 
"The only way to fix it is if the already integrated payment processors offer BCH, ETH, or other cryptos suitable for transactions. I don't get why they're dragging their feet, as it certainly is a matter of their survival.

For the merchant, the switch could be almost transparent."
I just sold earlier today. It's getting to the point that I'm starting to get on edge and I already more than doubled what I put in and I'm not going to miss on the already more than expected profit margin I made. I'm probably just going to use what I made to diversify more, leave a little in btc for a while for shits and giggles and move everything else around. I might regret it down the line but right now I feel like there's a pop on the horizon and it's scaring the shit out of me. There's just no way it can keep going up like it is.

Wrong.  You are blindly assuming Steam's ability to represent a significant amount of Bitcoin processing, both in a vaccuum and relative to China, illicit deals, the extreme trading frenzy which grows every day.  This doesn't show speculation, it shows you can't dent Bitcoin with something so small.  Steam is barely a blip compared to Silk Road and Mt Gox and look where we are now.

It's never been either. It's been a commodity like gold or frozen concentrated orange juice. Just because people call it a currency or if its creator made it as a currency, doesn't mean it's ever acted like one. And since its trading isn't regulated in any way, its price is being manipulated for profit by those with the means to do so.

Sorry, I was working and couldn't reply before.

Don't think I am trying to be condescending, I am just simplifying everything so you would understand the situation with whatever knowledge you have.

Bitcoins idea was proposed around 10 years ago in [this whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf), which specifically states Bitcoin is to be a decentralized currency. Both r/bitcoin and r/btc have been around for a long time and used to be very similar to eachother. Around 2 years ago two differently thinking camps emerged around Bitcoin, having different ideas for the future:

- (camp1) One wanting Bitcoin to scale on-chain, by making blocks in the blockchain bigger. This would mean that the currency could handle loads of transactions on the network and no organization or one group would have control over the network to profit from it (the users control the system = decentralization) and every transaction would be visible to others. This is exactly what the original idea in the whitepaper has in mind. The problem is however that the blockchain would get bigger more quickly and the nodes on the network (not ordinary users, but rather miners) would need Terabytes of storage space.

- (camp2) The other camp wants to keep blocks on Bitcoin 1MB size. This would mean limited transaction rates and thus high fees and waiting times to get your transaction through. The idea is supposedly to keep the blockchain itself small so everyone can store the data on their own devices if they want to. And moving most of transactions off of the chain onto sidechannels and something called the Lightning Network, where transactions are fast and cheap again. This move can however easily lead to companies facilitating these transactions and also benefiting off of these transactions. This is not the decentralization that the original idea had in mind and would almost be the same as nowadays banks profiting off of and controling the transactions that people make. Most people who understand the blockchain tech and want to get rid of banks hate this idea, but somehow the Core developers of Bitcoin are supporting it. A lot of conspiracies around, but people have been sniffing out some major banks and investment organizations are linked to funding the Core developers and might be pushing for Lightning Network to control Bitcoin and profit out of transactions.

This August, Bitcoin finally split into two: Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin backed by the Core developers (camp2) and Bitcoin Cash backed by pretty much the rest of the community (camp1). The moderators of r/bitcoin subreddit are mostly Bitcoin developers and have been heavily censoring the subreddit towards their liking and ideas. The r/btc does not censor and thus here you can see the community hatred towards Bitcoin and support of Bitcoin Cash.

[Bitcoin network constantly clogging up because of the 1MB block sizes seen live here.](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#2w) The upper graph shows how many transactions are waiting on the network currently to go through. Right now there are around 160k pending transactions. The average transaction fee right now is around $7. Bitcoin can never work with 1MB blocks on the chain and be a decentralized currency with low fees. The only thing it has is really at the moment, that it is ""digital gold""; ""store of value"". Bitcoin Cash with bigger block could transact much more transactions per/day, but it does not have the recognition of the average public member and not many people use it.


**TLDR**: Bitcoin split into Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash a few months ago. Bitcoin just got the name, because the original developers went that way. Bitcoin Cash follows much closer to the original idea of Bitcoin. This subreddit is pro Bitcoin Cash. We here believe it is far superior to Bitcoin."

"I lost all my dogecoin (20k? Maybe less)  when my wallet got hacked when one of the big sites went down that I used and connected wallets were emptied. Ah well. I could have had upwards of $20. 

I liked dogecoin because it was worthless. "
check out bitcoin.tax
Bitcoin Cash (BCH) fixed that. It's money again.
Kraken. Bitfinex too, maybe?
Obviously good for bitcoin.
/r/bitcoin is one of the most heavily censored subreddits on this site. You will not see anything there except full-throated enthusiasm for BTC because everything else is deleted. It's T_D of cryptocurrency.
It makes a kind of selfish sense. No one wants to spend their BTC, but they want other people to spend theirs and drive adoption, thus increasing the value of the hodlr's stash.
I'm not overly educated on bitcoin but I always thought the darknet markets supported the need for btc more than anything.
Sure gonna hurts if the only way to spend bitcoins are through heavy regulated exchanges.
It’s the mainstream effect
Apparently they all made it here to upvote their own kind. Sad!
"If you have to pay lots of taxes without any actual changes to the tax laws, you're winning.

I'd gladly pay millions in income tax, as long as I have the income that goes with it.

Likewise, having to pay an income or fringe benefis style tax on your income doesn't really affect it. You're still getting 70% of something as opposed to nothing at all."
Capital Assets are barely taxed, why would this be an issue? 
Dude clearly we would pick ethereum or/and litecoin. They are far superior coins, besides the undervalued price!
What  bitcoin cash exchange does this sub usually recommend? I am new here. 
Yeah tether volume is at 1.3 billion today.  They've printed 100s of millions of new ones over the last month or so.  Something doesn't seem right.
With the tax break coming rich. people are investing in alternative formats to stocks and bonds. 
Consider pulling out of crypto. If bitcoin bursts it’ll cryptos will fall. I doubt any crypto will rebound to usability or value again. Definitely diversify, but not all into the same market
I think federally backed crypto is the only way to go. I think crypto-currency is the next evolution of currency. But if there is no authority to back it up, then there is no reason to believe it's value. And there is no one there to catch it when it falls.
I'd even go so far as to say btc was created by govt and pumped by the media to get us to embrace the idea of a crypto cashless economy, so we readily accept it when they come out with their official govt crypto and harm non-govt cryptos with regulation.
They *did* open tabs. You could do just that
You just made it inconvenient by adding an extra step.
In my eyes, it's more the problem of volatility than anything.
That doesn’t need to be difficult. The merchant doesn’t need to be adjusting prices of items because only conversion rate changes. So if a game is $20, the merchant just needs to advertise $20 as the price. The buyer will pay the equivalent in bitcoin according to the current conversion rate. In that sense it is not unlike paying with other foreign currency. The difference here is that the conversion rate changes happen too fast for bitcoin and by the time the merchant receives the funds, the value may be way off from the time the buyer made the payment. There is no way for merchant to be able to predict what the conversion rate will be when he receives the funds. The high fees are making it impractical to use bitcoin in retail, and that is too bad — bitcoin was not supposed to be a get-rich-quick scheme.
Agreed

No, they've pivoted to a store of value rather than a way to actually buy things on a regular basis. The transaction times and fees are way too high for any sensible peer to peer use (vs other coins)
Market don't care
I think many are forgetting how long it'll take to get out of large positions... Many exchanges limit withdrawals.
Hm, that's why it just hit 14,000 dollars.
Eh it's a toy currency

Because there is no point in terms of fees or time to use it anymore. 
Why don't they embrace an alternate like etherium or monero?  
Do they except gold? Why would they accept digital gold? They should use litecoin or Iota.
Didn't even know steam accepted Bitcoin
RIP my now non-existent wallet. I️ deposited in BTC a lot.
I just started buying games this way. I only got one.
Maybe we should have accepted the move to Segwit2x? That would have probably helped?

This is SteamDB, not Steam. Still, it's sad.
People who believe in the technology will carry on carrying on. Doesn't have to be btc, personally I prefer the team behind Litecoin but that's just my opinion in this speculative world of crypto.
Want to talk about a scary market that could be taking place if retailers start rejecting BTC. 
Guess peer to peer remains btc’s focus.
interesting
the main problem with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin is that aren't enough marketmakers to stabilize the price for transactions to complete. Add to that there aren't derivative devices like options to narrow the bid/ask price & lower transactional costs.
I didn't know it was an option to begin with.
Ruh roh raggy
Where can I get a short position?? 
SHORT SHORT SHORT
Shit. I just bought a game for BTC two days ago. 
Short Bitcoin
I think Bitcoin will become more of a storage of money at this point. Some other coin will become the spending of said money. I kind of thought that's how Litecoin would work out, or maybe DASH. Who knows, it all feels very wrong and not like how Bitcoin was supposed to be
Unless bitcoin drops off the #1 spot it's going potentially delay crypto adoption by years. Bitcoin Cash will never be the solution, it'll always cause confusion by living in the shadow of the original bitcoin.

I presume most people here knew about this already.

The TL;DR is the IRS considers BTC property and is taxed as such. 

Due to its soaring price merchants are ditching it because of the potential tax burden."
Sounds like Bitcoin Core is finally losing Steam.
Waiting for the BTC bubble to burst is like waiting for the new season of Thrones. It's been a long wait, but it's gonna be one hell of a ride once it starts up.
This news basically shook my last bit of hope for btc. Just bought a ton of Bitcoin Cash and bought some precious metals with the rest of it
"> As of today, Steam will no longer support Bitcoin as a payment method on our platform due to high fees and volatility in the value of Bitcoin.
> 
> In the past few months we've seen an increase in the volatility in the value of Bitcoin and a significant increase in the fees to process transactions on the Bitcoin network. For example, transaction fees that are charged to the customer by the Bitcoin network have skyrocketed this year, topping out at close to $20 a transaction last week (compared to roughly $0.20 when we initially enabled Bitcoin). Unfortunately, Valve has no control over the amount of the fee. These fees result in unreasonably high costs for purchasing games when paying with Bitcoin. The high transaction fees cause even greater problems when the value of Bitcoin itself drops dramatically.
> 
> Historically, the value of Bitcoin has been volatile, but the degree of volatility has become extreme in the last few months, losing as much as 25% in value over a period of days. This creates a problem for customers trying to purchase games with Bitcoin. When checking out on Steam, a customer will transfer x amount of Bitcoin for the cost of the game, plus y amount of Bitcoin to cover the transaction fee charged by the Bitcoin network. The value of Bitcoin is only guaranteed for a certain period of time so if the transaction doesn’t complete within that window of time, then the amount of Bitcoin needed to cover the transaction can change. The amount it can change has been increasing recently to a point where it can be significantly different.
>
> The normal resolution for this is to either refund the original payment to the user, or ask the user to transfer additional funds to cover the remaining balance. In both these cases, the user is hit with the Bitcoin network transaction fee again. This year, we’ve seen increasing number of customers get into this state. With the transaction fee being so high right now, it is not feasible to refund or ask the customer to transfer the missing balance (which itself runs the risk of underpayment again, depending on how much the value of Bitcoin changes while the Bitcoin network processes the additional transfer).
> 
> At this point, it has become untenable to support Bitcoin as a payment option. We may re-evaluate whether Bitcoin makes sense for us and for the Steam community at a later date.
> 
> We will continue working to resolve any pending issues for customers who are impacted by existing underpayments or transaction fees.

"Ask them on Steam to support Bitcoin Cash instead since it has low TX fees:

"Honestly they are right

Even Satoshi said the system was about low fees

But what happened is the number for fees remained the same as the price increased whereas the mining fee should’ve decreased.

I guess they may adopt Bitcoin Cash? Living the real concept"
I wonder how many other merchant will look at things like this and be less likely to look into crypto as a means of payment as a result.
"> Less than two years after adopting Bitcoin as a payment option on Steam, Valve has announced that it is dropping support for the virtual currency. The decision to eliminate the option comes as a result of both the extremely high transaction fees charged by Bitcoin, and recent, also-extremely-high levels of instability in its value.

emphasis on:

>The decision to eliminate the option comes as a result of both the **extremely high transaction fees** charged by Bitcoin, and recent, **also-extremely-high levels of instability in its value**.""

See what you've done, Blockstream Core?"
Can't blame them, currencies are supposed to be stable and bitcoin is currently anything but stable. 
I mean...I wouldn’t take it as currency either. It’s too volatile. If the price goes down tomorrow then it loses half its value or whatever. It will go down, just how much is the question. 
Funny- literally just saw news of this elsewhere.  Had a feeling this would be on r/btc ... came right over here to check my premonition..... TOP NEWS?!?! Sad.  Bitcoin-hate is the top news in a BCH-driven subreddit?  SMH

Fix the transaction fee problem and the hemorrhaging will stop.
"Tax plan passed which increased the debt by a trillion and in turn weakens the dollar.

BTC has more value than a USD as demonstrated by the upwards surge. Its scarce because theres a finite amount where our shit US govt keeps printing money. When you have more and more of something the value spreads out accordingly.

If enough people places value on something ...it can be traded. It has value.

This is stupid. Bitcoin is a currency. You wouldn't change the amount of £ the game costs because the USD conversion rate changes from day to day. They should just charge an exact number of satoshi, and hold until they can cash out to their preferred currency at a profit. "
"Haha - fools. They are stopping for different reasons. 

I just transferred Bcash today and it takes for fucking ever!

Steam is not using bitcoin any longer, because it's too volatile for their business.

"Can someone tell me what is the point of using cryptocurrency on Steam? No one gives a fuck what games you'll play. The currency should be used on stuff you dont want the government to know. Paying for normal shit like games or coffee is just...stupid. The irony here is that cryptocurrency showed us that real currency is better for normal use. Cryptocurrency is only used by investors, and they dont do anything with it but sit on it.

Btw, I love text on the right.

""There is no government, company, or bank in charge of Bitcoin. As such, it is more resistant to **wild inflation** and corrupt banks.""

Yeah, but not to wild deflation, which is just as damaging. Who would wanna put any serious money into a system with such fluctuation? And look at whats happening now. Sure, no corrupt banks, instead the value is decided not by anything real, like changes on the market, but instead by investors wanting to make a quick buck."
Further proof that bitcoin is more of a scam/pyramid scheme/false construct than an actual valuable entity.  Its use should be banned everywhere.  
Use Litecoin
"I guess they realized anybody can make a shitcoin  
And worst of all: people will adopt it"
Converting BTC to LTC
Its sad that both sides are freaking out right now... The btc trolls and bch trolls cant control themselves over tiny changes... How about waiting and seeing what will happen since NOBODY KNOWS..
Probably smart since it's fake money
who cares ?!
Steam has had their throats cut by the world Government
The divide is amazing because many are upset that it is not being adopted and others are upset that people are not HODLing. I wonder why Steam is no longer accepting it though. Perhaps the fees and wait times are an issue. 
What’s the conversion rate of BTC to Schrute Bucks? 
every time a service stops accepting btc, price rises because there's less sellers.

This post has also a huge amount of upvotes on r/bitcoin.
You're all fanatics, you're all also fucking pathetic. Why can't you have both? Shit, Valve might event adopt a different cryptocurrency, this is not politics. 
Thread was hijacked by a bunch of morons who don't understand cryptocurrency. Muh tulips, muh.bubble, muh Bitcoin is dead,  same rhetoric for years. Wake up you fucking zombies. Time to make peace that the old system you worship in fiate is nonsense. Your dollars are losing value and most people who own are not going to give them up especially at these low prices. Omg he said bitcoins price is low?!?!!?? Reeeeeeee
How can you mine BCH?
They don't like how unstable the currency is. 
I’m not advocating one or way or another I’m just asking how deflationary currency would be handled. 
Steam should support btc!
What bubble ?? - I wish I have bought more bitcoin if it wasn't for the dam bank and the exchange dragging their foot and put a hold on my money.  I would have bought more bitcoins and gained equity on my investment...instead, my usd money is seating on the exchange (finally) and the Bitcoin price is at $14,300, which is more than $2,300 higher than 24 hours ago...
Looking forward to the BTC dip. Then we can already play fallout 5 on our pc's, while paying in BTCs
"So let me get this straight: (purely looking for education)

1. How does adoption of accepting a crypto help the asset BCH grow?"
The major reason is because bitcoin price is far from stable, and can change thousands in 1 single day.
SODL - what you would call the equivalent of HODL in selling mode? 
We still accept bitcoin at www.Negash83.com
No Bitcoin no game
Good, they were overcharging. 
you can't walk into Walmart and pay with a bar of Gold. Same logic.
Traitors! Long live Core! /s
ENJINCOIN the crypto for gaming.
why is blocksize a public debate? Bitcoin can add 2nd layers. Is bitcoin like a Swiss bank account for moving large sums of money or for micro transactions like buying coffee? What about rootstock, side chains, atomic swaps? 
Get the fuck out of Bitcoin while you still have any money at all.
LOL! So this is reddit bitcoin and you guys actually hate bitcoin? You should open a tulip subreddit and talk about tulips all day.
Should they use BCash instead?
Well, they never accepted gold, so I guess that makes it pretty clear which direction BTC is headed. 
But my currency of the future!??!?!?
Steam is rightfully worried, exchange risk is a major problem. Wonder what exchange CME will settle bitcoin futures through.. 
makes sense since BTC is no longer made for payments
So, It might be true that the central planners will short Bitcoin. I don't care. I luv Monero!
"I'm not surprised.

If Bitcoin transaction fees don't come down to 2% - 3% to compete with major payment processing services then it will never see mass market adoption for payment processing.  The last Bitcoin payment I sent today had TX fees over 10%, 4x higher than my other payment processing services - it's fucking ridiculous and I'm losing interest in using it for business.

Bitcoin developers and miners had better start figuring out how to compete with mainstream payment processors."
Who would have thought that a wildly unstable and unpredictable currency doesn’t inspire confidence in vendors?
the way BTC is you don't want to be in the middle either, because the exchanged will hold you up at gun point. they make their money of trades not the currency itself, if it pops a a big number, they just don't have enough to pay people out.
"Well the price is still increasing. And there still seem to be people that want to buy bitcoin.

However if bitcoin keeps losing acceptance as a currency (which is likely as few people will want to pay with something that rapidly increases in value) then it's really just a matter of time before everything collapses."
Everyone is waiting for the burst...
*you have been banned from /r/bitcoin*

No idea what any of that meant.
/u/tippr gild the truth
You'd still need 10TB blocks to have 3 billion people use the block chain each making 1-2 transactions a day for 0 fees and that doesn't include all the junk and spam and business transactions, you need layer 2 solutions. At even 1gb blocks youd have like only data center nodes, easily coopted by the government, it's about censorship resistant money on the base layer.
Nobody seems to care about the environmental issues of mining cryptocurrency.... 
I mean, I agree that 1MB is too small, but it's ludicrous to claim that 1GB blocks are feasible. How many people can download and validate 144GB a day?
Meh, or you change the network topology like DASH did. Let's not pretend gigabyte blocks are a real solution, there's a lot of hand-waving involved like assuming SSD sizes and network speeds going up indefinitely. And of course, massive block-size increases lead to centralization.
Yikes .09 now. Hahahahahahaha
My close friend has a vpn business. Unyil several months ago they had about 5% of their sales paid in bitcoins. For the last 3 weeks, zero bitcoin payments. Ita just not useful as a currency anymore. Unless a solution is found bitcoin will never become a payment system.
">Why in the world would you waste something that is going up in value as a payment method if you have other forms of payment.

And this is going to be the death or at least severe wounding of bitcoin. 

If the price is going up why spend it and if the price is going down why accept it as payment"
"If you are buying with $ that you could be using to buy bitcoin it's the same exact thing.

Pay $10 for game is the same as pay $10 for btc then pay btc for game. "
Ironic
"When spelled out like that it seems that there's little utility to cryptocurrencies as a whole.

In the beginning there's was this idea that it would be big for international transfers and would dethrone Paypal at least, but the dreamers were aiming for Visa levels. That hasn't happened at all. On Ebay, Etsy, Ali, etc there are almost no merchants taking cryptos. The shops taking cryptos are limited to bitcoin, the others haven't seen almost any adopton.

On paper cryptos sound so nice. What's the problem? Are they hard to use? Hard to understand? The volatility of the exchange rate? Politics?"

Today's [**blitzkrieg for BCH merchant adoption** is (sensibly) targeted at Steam](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7i0ml8/bitcoin_cash_merchant_adoption_blitzkrieg_day_3_6/). It's something constructive that you can do which takes but a minute.
That has never been a factor in using bitcoin on steam. People still used it.
This is the internet. Nobody knows econ 101 here.
"Well no shit. Some of these people literally became millionaires simply because they ran their computer over night mining Bitcoins after they heard about it on 4chan, using electricity that mummy and daddy paid for.

Of COURSE they want it to be used as a store of value because that guarantees scarceness which makes them rich.

Hell, if I held a bunch of Bitcoin I wouldn't want it to become a proper currency either! Real currencies need to remain stable and not jump up 25% one day and drop 15% the next. 

What pisses me off is I bought my first BTC and ETH in January this year. I heard about BTC for years and always regretted not getting in earlier and finally decided this year I'd dip my toes in and learn about it properly.

Later on I made a larger investment when all the alts were exploding and the $14 AUD ETH I bought was now worth $250 AUD.

I traded all my BTC for alts that sounded promising after learning about BTC's scaling issues and where has that gotten me? Stratis tanked and finally recovering slowly, Eth has gone up a bit, BAT has gone sideways... I'm probably 1.5X's more initial investment. Nothing to cry about but I would have made more investing that back into my business.

Meanwhile, if I left my entire investment in a shitcoin with no scaling, no use cases, a divided community I would have made like 5X profit. Now I'm looking to buy in again so I can diversify even more but there's no fucking way I'm gonna FOMO again and watch the prices tank 60% 24 hours later."
Time to sell the beanie baby collection.....
"Their level of cognitive dissonance is mind blowing, I can't even believe it's happening at all.  And I still hold BTC but I know it's shit, I'm only staying in because I don't need it... and maybe these crazies will continue to drive the 'gold price' up.

All I want is a usable crypto again that's widely accepted, scaled, and stable like BCH so I can go back to things like paying for steam games/VPN/donations/etc with it.

I feel like I'm taking crazy pills for wanting that after reading r/bitcoin these days."
Honestly, I am so excited for when the whole thing crashes one day.
You are stuck on v1 of crypto. Ride the wave but remember to get onboard with v3 cough Iota cough
"An ""on-chain"" transaction is just a normal transaction, it uses the block chain for validation.  This is what people mean by ""transaction"" 99% of the time.

An ""off-chain"" transaction is something that bypasses the block chain and uses some other way to validate the transaction.  Example would be the Lightning Network that Bitcoin Core is working on.

Block size refers to how much data can be included in a single ""block"" on the block chain.  Bitcoin has a 1MB hard-coded limit in the block size, which means there is a limit to how many transactions can be processed, and that doesn't scale well.  This is a problem today as evidenced by high transaction fees and slow confirmation times with Bitcoin.  

Bitcoin Cash's solution was to increase this block size.  Bitcoin's solution is to do some things separately from the block chain (""off-chain"").  One (of many) problems with this is that the technology doesn't exist to do this yet, so for now Bitcoin Cash works and Bitcoin doesn't - that's why Steam dropped support for Bitcoin."

"everyone accepts it in exchange for any other digital currency.... like gold to fiat.

You can even trade it for BCASH on every single exchange that lists BCASH if you're gullible enough to get scammed."
At $10,000 or $12,000 a unit, even getting out now will get you a tidy profit. Unless... you were the sucker who bought it at those prices. 
"I'm not sure if they have came out and said it but Namecheap is basically unusable now for the same reasons as Steam. I want to buy a $0.49 domain but I'm not spending $10+ in TX fees to do that. That's even worse than a gift card if you're trying to stay anonymous.

Same with using a cloud server and paying them in BTC, like Vultr. I expect they will eventually offer something else or turn off Bitcoin as well.

All of these are symptoms of the same root problem which is the inability to provide utility in the $5 - $10 range."
"That's not such a problem it's just an issue of people have problems with decimal places.

The other point is entirely true though."
What you need to look at is the market cap. Which is still stupid big.
Depends on the user base. The EUR certainly is. The whole argument is fundamentally flawed by comparing national currencies or GDP's with something trans-national.
Confusing total currency in circulation with face value... but still not a currency.

No. 
BCH is meant to be a currency.
Maybe
He means that there wasn't an actual reason behind it, other than people putting money into it. People putting money into it isn't an economic reason. When people put money into a currency, it doesn't spike and start doubling in value. Bubbles and values based on speculation and no actual backing behind it does that, making it not a real currency or form of payment, and making it even more volatile.. that when you have invested in it, and get the news that there's a drop, you may not even make it to a computer before what you have is worth zero.
That's because it hasn't popped yet. It will, because people are speculating, not using it for transactions. 
Why do people get so offended by the idea of BTC being a bubble? There's no real room for debate at this point, you have people pouring money into it with no clue what it actually is, because they think it's some sort of money printing scheme. There's plenty of money to be made in a bubble if you're smart.

 Some people think it's around the corner, some people think they'll see $100k by the end of 2018, some might even think it'll never stop in their lifetime. So they dine exclusively on good news and make plans for how they're gonna spend their fortune.

"> Is there a simple guide that explains how bitcoin has actual worth?

[speculation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/speculation.asp)"
A good point, well made!
"People are speculating that the block chain is a revolutionary concept and disruptive technology. Saying it's just a speculative bubble is like saying cell phones and internet is just a fad
 Crypto is here to stay and things are just starting to heat up. Couple that with a GLOBAL market and you're going to see a specialist bubble like you've never seen. Cheers!"
What it is: market that can be manipulated by biggies (Kim dot com) without any pesky regulatory agencies crying foul. 
"Did you read their statement?

>they sell something and get 50$ in bitcoins. Bitcoins getting more expensive only gives them more money, 60$ for example

That assumes the price is only ever going up. If it is a bubble, and the bubble pops, they may lose all the gains. Generally, businesses don't like added risk. It's why they buy insurance. They'd prefer less volatility, even if they get a little bit less for it.

And the quickly moving price makes it a pain in the ass to deal with when it comes to slow transaction times and high transaction fees. You buy a game, but the transaction takes a long time, and the price drops 8% in that time. Now what? Pay another transaction fee and send the rest? Cancel the sale and have them send the money back to you? Who pays that transaction cost? Pay the rest with a credit card? That defeats the purpose in the first place
"
They probably liquidate it into cash ASAP. Companies would rather invest in themselves than an external asset.
"> Bitcoins getting more expensive only gives them more money, 60$ for example

yeah, and then tomorrow bitcoin loses 80+% of it's value, like it has before, and suddenly that $50 in coins is worth $10"
"There is no guarantee of that. Bitcoin can all go up in smoke in a second. You don't truly believe something only rapidly moves in one direction do you?

It's too volatile to be used as currency. And if you're a large business, that means you can lose a lot of money too if you rake in a bunch of bitcoin. 

But the likely reason is the government taking issue with it and Valve just doesn't want to deal with this. 

There is no upside. If they wanted to make money from bitcoin jumping in value it makes more sense to just convert the regular cash payments to bitcoin if that's something they wanted to do. "
It absolutely can be traced that is a huge common misconception. The whole point of bitcoin is there is an immutable record of every transaction and each coin is cryptographically unique.

BTC is really going to hit unconfirmed tx ATH soon. I don't know if the general public will understand anything about it. They just probably buy off of Coinbase and leave it there.

I don't think you understand taxes.   If I held 20k in bitcoin and it goes up to 30k before i liquidate,  i pay .. let's say $3k in taxes on that $10k gain.   My total net benefit is the $20k payment +$7k gain net of taxes = $27k.  If someone had paid in USD, i would only have the $20k payment.

If BTC is raising in price pretty quick then wouldn't it be kind of silly to spend it on something like a game? Of course it does need to be spent to become a currency but what reason is there to spend it?

I disagree. There might be a few different coins for different niche markets, but I still think there will be one or two main ones for general-purpose purchases.

how do you solve for deflation if there is a fixed amount? the inherent problem with finite supply is you inevitably end up with whale hoarders who essentially become a sudo mafia and can control the market..which i think is the case with BTC at this point.

"If you think it's only good for buying things then it's no better than Paypal.

Keeping your money safe from governments seems a much better use than buying games - which you can do with cash or a credit card already."
Wasn't the point of cryptocurrencies to get *rid* of middlemen and extra steps?  Payment processors have been known to screw people over and censor/freeze funds of people they don't agree with.  Just look at what paypal did to VPN providers.  Cryptocurrency was supposed to be an end to this and a direct transfer of value to pay people for services and whatnot.  It's literally the bitcoin whitepaper title.
I stand corrected!
But isn’t that the same with any currency? You would hold it only if you think its value will not diminish. BTC is not unique in that regard. The one advantage non-crypto currency has is that you can easily buy milk and things you need everyday with it. The advantage BC has is that a big government or a bank can’t easily manipulate it. The crypto-currency will certainly continue to evolve and will probably get wider adoption. (I wouldn’t be surprised if ApplePay was already working on it.j

That is what Satoshi claimed but it doesn't necessarily mean those were the true intentions. The way I see it, if it was really a threat to the central banking system, they would have regulated it in several ways by now. The fact that nothing was done to manage this ""threat"" tells me it was a part of the plan.

>That's like an Illuminati level conspiracy theory with people thinking decades ahead

Yes that is what I'm alleging, if we define the ""Illuminati"" as being the central banking cartel that all govts in the world are indebted to.

I think there was a plan to introduce a cashless economy for a while now and Bitcoin was a part of the psyop to get people onboard with the idea. When the next economic crash inevitably comes and makes us even more miserable than we are now, people will beg the govt for a fix and crypto will be right there, likely doing very well during this crash.

Now, you buy coffee every day to the tune of $50 a week + some online shopping for another $50.  Load $100 to BTC and spend as you go.  When your spend wallet gets low, you top up with another $100.  In this way, your coffee isn't $5 its really $3 because your coin appreciates.

Because really, lets look at the logic of never spending any of your BTC.  You buy $100 worth of coffee every month.  You could have not bought coffee and bought $100 more in BTC.  Oh, wait, movies? dinner? dress for the wife? toy for the kid?  No, don't buy anything, put it all in BTC.  Saying that you can't spend any BTC, even for transactions makes as much sense as that logic.

But, you can only do that if BTC transfers for pennies.  Now, you top up with BCH or ETH.  Oh, wait, kitties are here, BCH only."

Kraken and Bitstamp both support BCH. Coinbase is expected to add BCH support by January 1, 2018. Those are the three biggest exchanges AFAIK.
"""Cryptocurrencies are not supposed be used as a currency"""
"The Bitcoin (BTC) network can handle about 3 people making a transaction each second.

Each transaction pays a (small) fee to whichever miner adds it to the ledger called the blockchain.

When there are more transactions than a miner can fit into the block that he is adding to the ledger (which in BTC has a maximum size), he chooses the transactions that make him the most money.

Because there are consistently more than 3 people per second wanting to make a transaction with BTC, they all are bidding up the fee that makes they're transaction more desirable to a miner.

So all of this means that the small fee from before is now a fairly sizable fee. While Steam isn't directly paying that fee, any time they process a refund they have to pay that fee, and they've been running into issues where they've had to do more refunds than average on specifically BTC purchases - customers would send Steam BTC but would get outbid on their fee and thus their transaction would get ""stuck"". Because Steam hasn't received money yet they don't consider the sale complete and don't give the customer the game they want, so the customer asks for a refund.

All of this costs Steam more money and hassle (which is money because you have to train employees in how to handle it) than it gains them, so they've stopped accepting BTC."
It's much smaller than the impact of all the efforts to keep the petrodollar afloat.

Due to this change in direction, Bitcoin is no longer suitable for use as a currency, which is why Steam just dropped it.

I think the misunderstanding here is that people buying bitcoin are actually looking at it as a currency. IMO to probably 90% of people, if not more, bitcoin is an investment not a currency. To some bitcoin is currency and they think they everyone should use it and USD is satan. However I think that the true value of bitcoin is more like gold. No one actually uses gold as a currency anymore, however it is seen as like the fallback currency or an investment which is why it is worth so much. I don't know if it will continue to grow until it catches up to gold or if it will fall but no one really does. In reality most people putting money into bitcoin are doing so expecting that it will continue to grow and so long as more and more people start to think that it is a good investment the more it will grow. It does have some inherent value as a currency sure, as it is kind of like online cash that can't really be traced outside of the two people who exchanged the money which is great for things like drugs, however we're well past that point.
And the fact that hackers can just take your bitcoin. There’s no backup. The community can’t/won’t save you if you are hacked. It’s too risky. There is a bubble and it will burst as more larger holders get hacked. The hackers are idiots bc they don’t realize that the more hacking of bitcoin becomes rampant the less value it holds and soon it’s just useless math. 
"People want to pay with a current like that. It's business that don't want to take a currency that's rapidly growing in worth. 

Edit: I think I just have a different mind about investing. Probably because I don't do it hardly ever and I haven't yet with btc. The amount it is at right now would definitely have me cleaning out some but obviously not all of it. "
"> Also, do you want the metaphoric bubble to burst? 

First of all, metaphoric? What?  
  
Second of all, yes, yes you do want it to burst. If the currency is legitimate, it will fall to reasonable trading levels. There is a reason we don't use commodities with essentially fixed supplies as currency, which is what you have now with btc. The value in btc comes from it being used, not from holding onto it. The bubble bursting would be the best thing to happen to btc at this point."

*When* it fails, cryptocurrency will reset like the video game industry.  The next biggest player will invest in a regulatory process to ensure the currency is difficult to use for illicit transactions and money laundering, and when that happens, cryptos will start growing again, but only slower.

"> (camp1) One wanting Bitcoin to scale on-chain

Let's take a note of something.  This was always the plan for Bitcoin.  [The project's creator was quite clear about that](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1347.msg15366#msg15366) and until 2011 or so nobody would have questioned that it would be removed long before it was an economic factor.  [The change was foisted on us.](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3h9cq4/its_time_for_a_break_about_the_recent_mess/)

Now understand, one of the main reasons someone holds a crypto - any consensus (blockchain) crypto -  is the idea that ""nobody controls your currency, nobody can inflate or arbitrarily change the economics of the system without your consent.""  ""Even the devs?"" you might ask.  ""no not even the devs, if they do something you don't like, we can always fork.""

Well, the economics of the system **were** changed without our consent (this is what a soft fork does), so we hard-forked to BCH.

BTC might or might not grow up to be something one day.  Who knows.  But the system appears unusable now and in the foreseeable future.  The point is quite simple: BCH (the original plan) is still *just the better plan.*

Now maybe us libertarians are the minority now and the rest of the noobs jumping into Bitcoin BTC to get rich quick don't care about privacy or AML or ever spending them on anything but US Dollars but I think that the original idea of making onchain Bitcoin into a global currency or bringing financial sovereignty to 3 billion unbanked was pretty hip and *way* more disruptive than anything proposed from the BTC camp, which seems much more like ""banking enablement technology"" to me.

BCH is BTC with the training wheels taken off.  I'm really excited to see what it's about to do.  There are no barriers to entry, unlike with BTC, or competing objectives, unlike with ETH.  It's like a Petri dish with $22B of agar in it."

What other companies have disappeared from Bitcoin?
Well considering crypto is designed in part to take power away from the state and central banks that seems like a stretch. That's like an Illuminati level conspiracy theory with people thinking decades ahead. It is however reasonable to believe that governments might eventually concede to the idea of a digital blockchain currency but force their way into the system so that they can still control the monetary supply. Obviously the biggest hurdle would be that this would likely mean that the same government that decided big banks were too big to fail a decade ago will now think that big banks are completely unnecessary. I remain skeptical of how it'll get done but my cynicism tells me that we'll end up with the convenience of Bitcoin minus the convenience of physical cash and minus the economic benefits of crypto

Assessment on where we are with the transaction fees and adoption rate. As well prices. 
"Fair enough.  We reassess where we are in 2018.  Of course my statement is that the banks have infiltrated and corrupted BlockStream/Core.  Not sure we will see that being completely unveiled by then.

So what then are the parameters of this?  How do we determine who is right or wrong? And about what?"
"You go shopping for shoes.  You don't know anyone who has a open channel with the store, so you need to open a channel with the store.  Are you going to pay a low fee and wait hours for confirmation?  Or, are you going to pay the median fee of $3.85?  Then when you close the channel, you pay another $3.85.  By the time you're using Lightning next year, the on-chain BTC fee will be a lot higher than $3.85.

Exchanges will be regulated by the IRS or FinCen.  Which means censorship-resistance is out the window.  Also, money gets lost at exchanges every year.  You'll need to provide KYC to the exchange you'll use.  How many people are going to go through this hassle, instead of just using Visa, Paypal, cash or another crypto?

Banks and exchanges get hacked every year.  Hackers steal funds or databases of identities every year."
This is great and entertaining idea. WhAt do you mean btc isn’t a currency nutzo 
Just avoid SegWit and I am set for what? Transaction fees in tens, hundreds and thousands as more and more people need to transact? That is MENTAL. Bitcoin BTC is use-less... and getting more use-less as time passes by. So no thanks. Bitcoin Cash is the one real Bitcoin only.
Absolutely!  It just gets in the way on the idea that people are going to use it for 'coffee'.

No, you open the wallet and import the keys to your wallet, it stays in your wallet on your iPhone or computer.

"What percentage of people use segwit right now? About 10%.

So using segwit transactions actually would have been the misleading thing to do because the average person does not use it. If use were 90%, then the demonstration using non-segwit transactions would have been misleading.

> RBF allows you to manually input incredibly low fees of 10 sats a byte and than if the mempool gets congested you can easily bump the fees to 40-50 sats a byte to get a quicker conf.

Is this really what you recommend a customer do? It needs to just work, every time."

Or....use BCH. 
"Nope, most here hold bitcoin but remember the good old days when it actually worked even with 0 fees.

This is a subprime bubble reloaded. Subprime Bitcoin bubbles while the prme Bitcoin Peer To Peer Cash doesn't. 
No, the name was stolen when they added Segwit, RBF and stopped increasing the block size. The coin currently called Bitcoin is closer to stock in Blockstream than it is a cryptocurrency
"> This sub hates Bitcoin. $15,000 and rising and all of you guys sold for an altcoin 

What makes you think you know what I did with my holdings?"
"Fundamentally there is a tremendous value to an honest ledger that anyone can use -- and it's more valuable the less that ledger costs to use, and the more people it supports. Bitcoin has lost its use due to artificial constraints placed on capacity, and it's therefore worth a lot less than the market is pricing it at currently.


This is coming from someone (and from a lot of people) who have made a lot of money by correctly buying Bitcoin years ago and predicting the price increase, back when Bitcoin was intended to scale. Now that it isn't intended to scale anymore, I'm really curious why people still think it's worth something.

The market is wrong all the time, and I'm fairly confident it's wrong right now. But it will figure things out eventually. Traders make money by correctly betting against the market during times when the market is wrong.
"
"Segwit isn't required for 2nd layer. The fact you believe this to be the only way 2nd layer is possible conveys your lack of understanding. The fact that you have to use a shitcoin to ""save on fees"" also conveys a level of delusion. You shouldn't have to use anything else in a functional crypto aside from your crypto of choice. Being forced to use dogecoin shows weakness... "

"""Right around the corner"" just another ""18 months"".

Is there literally nobody that recognizes the problems LN is facing in its network integration? It faces all the problems that have always faced mesh networks, all the very same problems that Bitcoin solved by *not being a mesh network*.

The developers that solve these age-old problems will be all over the media with their great achievement, other devs would be drooling over the beautiful victory made in providing real solutions after so many years.

Instead we get yet another pre-alpha ""release candidate"" with absolutely nothing under the hood, and not a single peep as to how these problems are being solved. If I weren't so fully aware how blind all of this FOMO money can be, I absolutely wouldn't be able to believe they fooled a single person with this latest PR stunt."

"It's not just network integration. LN has serious scaling problems, and all the ""solutions"" they've proposed points to centralization. It's literally Bankster 2.0: Electric Boogaloo. "
Interesting read, thank you
Good point, thanks, it's something I hadn't fully considered and the data backs it up. I guess it, as always, comes down to whether you think bitcoin is primarily a store  of value, or a means of exchange (and a little deeper than that, whether good money starts out as a store of value, or a means of exchange, before becoming the other). But you're right there, it appears at the time Bitcoin closed the door to being a convenient means of exchange at present time, other alts rose in response. 
"True! Ha. :)

Although to manipulate the mempool infinitely you do need deep pockets. Because some of those phony tx's with exorbitant fees WILL confirm so you gotta keep pumping them out.

But you're using the bitcoin currency, and putting a third party application onto it which is also de-centralized, i fail to understand how thats centralizing it, you're simply improving the underlying application.
"If that happens than most of the miners will switch, maybe except Slush(trator)pool. Than BCH will think, ""ohh there are too many of us, I have to rise the difficulty high so we will mine a block in 6 hours, not 6 minutes"". Than the dance of the difficulties will start drawing the spiral but still far from the deadlock. The only drastic thing what is about to happen is the PR impact where the confused crowd loses their faith and trust against the cryptoworld. And that will be hard to regain."
"Who says the ""customer"" is going to pay for the LN ramps? The way I see it, your bank will have your Bitcoins for you, and they will have LN channels open with companies (Amazon, whatever) for a monthly fee + limiting LN usage to small businesses not controlled by Wall Street.

Customers won't pay fees, would have a very convenient way of securing their Bitcoins and both banks and big comanies would be benefited.

I think that's Blockstream end game, and 99% of people would be ok with it.

The problem is... we are back where we started.

I hope we can still create an alternative economy soon enough... I'll do my best."

Because BTC is where everyone wants to make money. Look at the chart.  I bought and sold some yesterday just take make an easy couple percent gain. 
"The point is few people heard of bitcoin. Fewer people heard of ethereum. And even fewer people heard of litecoin and other cryptos. You know how you call tissues by the name kleenex? Brand name is extremely important when it comes to (mass)adoption. When you try to explain litecoin or dogecoin to someone their first question is likely to be ""oh is that like a bitcoin?"". Thats precisely why youre more likely to use bitcoin in favor of the others: brand name.

Technologically speaking BCH, ETH, DASH are all better at the moment. But they were not the pioneers. Bitcoin was. And that is why the legacy chain is more valuable."
"Because there is not enough liquidity in smaller coins to be able to buy and sell large amounts without moving the market too much and thus losing on the spread. $10 for fees is low if you save thousands of avoiding a spread loss.

BTC is for large values. Alts are for small values. ETH is for cats. ;)"
"The meme pool was quite full at 9k, weak support for current levels, great outlook at 42k again with ""meaning of life"" memes coming in."
Hmmm... .... .... Nope.  They've hosed it badly.  Despite all the warnings.
Do you believe this new printing of tether is influencing the rise of bitcoin? 
"> I also think that a more reasoned and calm approach to resolve the issue is a better way to proceed, rather than hurry to find solutions that could appear good today, but that may cause bigger issues tomorrow.

I think this is the wrong attitude for this time.

I think that the first cryptocurrency to scale to visa level transactions and merchant adoption will win in the long term, but also those cryptocurrencies that show the most progress to these goals in the medium term will do the best.

So ""throw everything at the wall and see what sticks"" is a better approach than ""choose one that plays it safe, and then hope it figures things out in the future"""
That's exactly the kind of thoughtful answer a paid shill would offer to avoid suspicion.
History before Blockstream came into the game.
">I believe the Bitcoin will be the coin that will emerge in the end, because its history have proven that it can sustain any attack.

That proof is not final. The [major attack is still underway](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3h9cq4/its_time_for_a_break_about_the_recent_mess) and frankly it's winning, and *you're helping the attackers*, sir."
"Fine. Agree to everything, except you ignore the fact that the development of what you call ""the Bitcoin"" (which is an insult to the Bitcoin concept and philosphy, to be honest) is monopolized by a single company who has bankers as investors. If this doesn't ring your alarm bells, frankly, you must not understand the Bitcoin concept and are likely just an investor/trader."
"About that attack are you speaking?  
Could you explain that attack to me?  "
"https://blockchain.info/charts/transactions-per-second?timespan=1year&daysAverageString=7

Yes there are more.

What do you mean it will clean as the  buzz will calm. You think people are going to use bitcoin less? Why so? Why would you want that?"
Potentially stupid question, how do you know what transactions are spam and what ones aren't ? (I don't know what the numbers on the charts mean)
Something is wrong with that graph as it does not correlate to reality.
If you look at https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#8h you can clearly see the upper tranches grow quickest. There are more 140+ s/b added to the mempool than the network can process in the last 8 hours. If it were cheap spam transaction the upper tranches would not grow because then those tranches would fit inside the blocks.  
https://pushtx.btc.com/#/ - not necessarily a recommendation, but they take BCH last I checked. 
"As someone who’s never tried to sell, and hold my BTC on a local wallet.

Can you explain to me why I’m retarded?

Honest question, I assumed that when it came time that I wanted to sell, I’d setup an exchange account, transfer to it, then sell.

Given how sketchy some exchanges have turned out to be, isn’t the safest long term plan to hold it on your own local wallet? "

This sub hates Bitcoin. $15,000 and rising and all of you guys sold for an altcoin and tried to steal the name bitcoin. On chain scaling is a bad idea. Literally you can use dogecoin and save on fees, and it has no mempool backlog too! Second layer for bitcoin transactions will be here soon and you guys can’t implement it because you blocked Segwit. SMFH. Buy actual bitcoin while you still can. Dump your altcoin before it only buys .01 BTC. The market is speaking.
I think it's also because we know lightening network is right around the corner

Can you provide a source for your statistics? I fail to believe that a crypto with a quarter trillion market cap and a value of $16k USD ($21k CAD) is declining. I’m not here to debate Lightening network but it has gained a lot of attention and the initial testing is going well. I don’t think bitcoins market share is going down anytime soon. 
"I hear this said all the time but it's never really made any sense to me. Of course its ""marketshare"" is declining when it once had 90%+, and when there are hundreds of new and valuable projects entering the space every few months. Do you think there's a company in the world that would pass on a 10x increase in their valuation if it meant losing 40% of their marketshare?

Also Bitcoin's marketshare is an inherently flawed measure as the ""market"" in this case is every single coin and token lumped together, even though many of them are in no way in competition with Bitcoin. It's like in the early days of the internet, if the world's first popular website gained 10x, but people were trying to say it was in decline because people are visiting other cool websites too. "
"Would be funny.  Some currency pegged to the BTC mempool.

I guess you could theoretically make a futures market..

Lightning Network.
"I guess that will be Karma in the form of Lightning Networks, MAST, Rootstock, Drivechain and dozens of extensions more that Bitcoin is getting, while Bcash has nothing but bigger blocks. I'm looking forward to it.
"
Yeah... all of us that hold BTC are really broken up about all of that obviously.  I'll take whatever group you're pointing to over Joel Osteen Ver any day of the week.

I think it was pretty low, I just used the default value when I transferred out of my wallet as I didn't realise the network was so congested and it said it should take ~60m which I was fine with. Fee was 0.00056376 BTC (currently $10 USD but sure that could be $100 tomorrow the way things are going)

If the price gets high enough, why would anyone mine anything else?
Your argument: If it can't be achieved in a short period of time then it's impossible. That's ugly.
"That’s obviously true, but the people on *that* sub are not posting/discussing/upvoting transaction backlog posts for exactly the same reason people on *this* sub are making posts like this one. It’s a negative story in the midst of an insane all-time-high.

If bitcoin cash were shooting up like a rocket and someone posted a negative story about some exchange dropping support, or some country banning its use, everyone here would tell them to fuck off with the concern trolling. "

What would you guess how much percentage do you represent your community?
Attaching to decentralised network in one point makes it centralised ... central...point.
"I know it won't cause an issue for BCH.  What I mean is if we see a mass crash of say 50% of BTC price and half the miners switch, block time for BTC would basically double and have no difficulty adjustment for days. 

I mean, I guess fees would increase almost exponentially as people try and bail... "
Yes, I need to get some coins off some exchanges too, but $2,000 daily withdrawal limits, on some exchanges, as I am not verified, as I am trying not to tag every bit with my ID, is painfully slow.  
">turn the blame back on BCH like shills always do. 

Shill? I have a bunch of BCH, thats how it works. 

BCH is useless, every major altcoin is better."
"Yep. Very good YSK here.

Hopefully it wont take 18 months
"That's a good theory only trumped by the fact that the LN will still need on-off ramps, and everyone will still need to transact. They might just do it a lot less ifthey plan on doing a lot of microtransactions. 

1mb isn't enough for having a functional LN. Neither is 2mb, or 8."
That's exactly what is means and why they introduced the lightning network, basically a bank between you and the blockchain of BTC. You pay less fees but you are not paying peer to peer and we will still need middlemen to take care of transactions. That means that the only one who will truly benefit from the lightning network will be blockstream and financial institutions who will still act as middlemen. 
That is not what I signed up for.
If you are willing to pay fees like that you might as well use WU and save yourself the trouble of converting anything to btc.
"The question is why the fuck would you want to?

Why not just use a different crypto? Why not just use Euro or USD or Yen?

Why not just send a shipment of gold across the Pacific?

"
I remember it was X40 ..not sure if 240K or 340K .. I will give a look.
It may not increase that much, because the market learns. The better indicator is the fee price, currently 360 sat/B. It can go to new records, even with a smaller queue.
Back in May it was over 200K
231k was the ATH in May.
It'll help Segwit adoption. There is enough space for those who care about low fees, most don't seem to bother.
"I believe the Bitcoin will be the coin that will emerge in the end, because its history have proven that it can sustain any attack.

I also think that a more reasoned and calm approach to resolve the issue is a better way to proceed, rather than hurry to find solutions that could appear good today, but that may cause bigger issues tomorrow.

I own several crypto-currencies (and actually a bigger amount of BCH than Bitcoins) because I learned to diversify my investment and not having both the foots in a single ship, but If I would be forced to put all my money in a single basket, it will be the Bitcoin.

Why?
Seriously, Greg isn't a prophet. Everything he says isn't meant to be interpreted literally.
"True words. With the ""visionaries"" in rbitcoin predicting a value of multiple millions per BTC, one has to stop and wonder why exactly we should make early adopters that invested 10$ millionaires. "
I have to make decisions based on what is credible and as to what you have said, I haven't read any plans about that, I have read plans of connecting the world to a new frontier of banking. Out with the old system, in with the new, everyone has access to money, the way life needs to be.
"First of all if you showed me wrong information I would absolutely change my mind. I'm not a theist.

However, your example only works if you are adding 1s not if 1s already existed in the mempool. "
"It's possible and it will be done, but we have to be careful not to bloat the blockchain or we will end up like Ethereum which grew so fast it's already much larger than bitcoin's even though it's a much newer coin. You can run a pruned version, but it's not an archival quality full blockchain anymore: http://bc.daniel.net.nz/

The worry is that as the blockchain grows too large less people will run full nodes, but I'm unsure if this is true. For example in case of Eth the number of nodes are growing not dropping: https://www.ethernodes.org/network/1 Having said that, BTC has appr. 4x as many as ETH nodes, which may be due to a smaller more affordable blockchain size, which translates to a much more decentralized and safe network.

The fast and cheap transactions will likely only be realized on sidechains and second and third layers of Bitcoin, because those don't require all the hundreds of millions of transactions per day (that we expect in a year or two) to be all archived on the main chain bloating it to become a monster. The main chain would only provide security for these other layers to work safely in extremely fast, like Ethereum or literally instantly. No more waiting for confirmations or looking up things on explorers. While you are not transacting on the main chain directly (only indirectly), you're enjoying virtually the same level of security, and dramatically improved user experience."

"Because if the number of small value transaction was increasing, the average mean would go down.

See:

1+1+1+1+5+1+7+8/8=3.125

7+7+7+7+7+7+7+7/8=7

You throw more ones in that second one, the average comes down.

I know this probably does not help.  They say when a person has accepted wrong information, that merely showing them that information is wrong, will not help them change their mind.  One has to be willing to accept that what they know might be incorrect.  I understand that you might not buy into the negative painting of these facts, and I would accept that.  But denying what mean and median represent is not something I will accept, even if their growing means little to nothing.

From my perspective, no transaction with a fee is SPAM.  If your blockchain cannot handle a lot of low fee transaction without blowing the rest of the transactions' fees out of the water, your blockchain is broken.

Yup. Easy to get lost when the bait-and-switch is so obvious.

"I would agree that the mempool alone or fees alone or price alone, are not a good metrics for measuring whether Bitcoin is succeeding or not.

In the end, a lot depends on what you see Bitcoin as.  If you are one of the recent ""Store of Value"" converts, then only one of those metrics matters to you.  It would be nice, if they took time to get educated and understand what makes Bitcoin valuable, but none of us can make anyone else do anything.

If you, as I do, see Bitcoin as peer to peer cash that would enable you to transact without banks or other third parties, then the first two metrics are very important. They are measuring the health of the blockchain, though I would say that the percentage of (nearly) full blocks is also important.

So I guess, one's perspective on whether BTC is good or bad, is partly or largely based on how one intends to (not) use it.  I feel that the issues surrounding the Core developers, the censorship of the rBitcoin sub and the coercion and general ugliness of the whole lot, also speaks to how broken it is."
"You are correct that the number of unconfirmed transactions is not a measurment of the health of the network per se. But people are exited because it is growing rapidly at the upper bands and fees are rising. Nobody cares about low fee transactions. They are irrelevant in deciding which transactions are included in the next block. Only the higest paid fees are. 

You seem to be under the the impression that there are multiple reasons for high fees and that people are acting emotionally driving the price up. This is very very wrong!

The height of the fee is decided 100% rationally by the market. If the influx of transactions (at the top) is higher than the output (fits in a block), more competition, fees will go up. If the output is higher, less competition, fees will go down.

"Look the only point I was trying to make is that you get guys on this sub constantly talking about the size of the mempool measured in unconfirmed transactions. I see non stop posts and threads about it.

I dont have any beliefs about tiny transactions being the cause of this. I said there are lots of reasons why the mempool being high could cause fees to be increasing. I have personally looked at the mempool in the past and said ""shit I guess I need a high fee"" and thus paid a higher fee to get into the next block where it may not have been needed. All I am claiming is you cant use the size of the mempool to talk about how bad Bitcoin is. Its foolish.

"
If you go into a restaurant. Do you ignore the Menu and just let them throw anything in front of you and ask for any amount of money? That is a really dumb way to live.
I believe Craig is Satoshi and showed a false proof (knowing what would happen) in order to get off the spotlight. That guy is very intelligent. I'm in the dark regarding what hapened with roger and mtgox, i'll give you that.
"A good strategy is to test and look at the fundamentals.

That would help you avoid pyramid scheme."
"But if the SPAM transaction are low fee, they are not competing in the marketplace and they would not be pushing the fees up.  They might be growing the mempool, but then they would be growing the 1s in the pool and that would invalidate your claim that the 1s already existed and negate your answer for why the average transaction value is increasing.

As for my douche questions, it is because you hand waved away the idea that letting go of incorrect beliefs was hard, by saying you are not a theist, but it is not a problem of just theist or atheists, it is a human problem.  

Here you have, what I feel is very obviously, an incorrect belief.  That SPAM is blocking up the mempool and causing it to look ""scary"".  All of the available data does not support this belief.  So you have claimed that the data is flawed.  Then claimed that the means of analyzing the data are flawed.  You have the blockchain downloaded?  You can do the analysis yourself, you can see with your very own eyes that SPAM (whatever ones definition of that is today) is not the issue.  It is that transactions are coming into the mempool at over the ~2200/block that they are going out and SPAM has nothing to do with it.  That the fees are increasing, to try and compete to get into the next block.  That the increase in value of Bitcoin is driving up the value of the transactions and that the little to non-existent SPAM is doing nothing.

Another person who had similar beliefs to you, claimed the SPAM attacks stopped once Bitcoin Cash forked.  Of course no one has any evidence of any SPAM attack, they just have a belief.  So fine, you are not a theist, but you have silly beliefs, just as they do.  Just like them, you do not believe that your beliefs are silly.  I get it, just because none of the facts support your belief, does not mean you can just let it go.  You have identified with the belief, it is part of you.  Letting go is hard."
"Part of the statement:

""...our goal has always been a smooth upgrade for Bitcoin. Although we strongly believe in the need for a larger blocksize, there is something we believe is even more important: keeping the community together.” ... “it is clear that we have not built sufficient consensus for a clean blocksize upgrade at this time. Continuing on the current path could divide the community and be a setback to Bitcoin’s growth. This was never the goal of Segwit2x.”

...following the announcement the Bitcoin went up. What other signals do you need to understand that the vast majority of the adopters were contrarily to Segwit2X? The agreement was decided by miners at closed doors... not by the community, and it failed.

It's not about safety.. it's about spending my time into idiocy. Good luck with it.
"I think this argument has been discussed already zillions of time:

- Roger Ver, someone that was caught to lie with the MtGox affair, trying to recycle his image, he's know only to be attached to his money (see his arrogance when he talks about his money). People here seems to have completely forgot.

All you need to do is dig. Their employees have said that their jobs were dependent on the outcome of the block debate. If you go read what they are planning to do side chains are necessary. For example for FIAT sidechains with banks. They've censored posts on rBitcoin about taking down banks and governments. One of the core developers said the state has authority from god to govern.
For their own interests? Jihan maybe, who knows. Craig? Roger? the guy is trying to found the first libertarian country, come on man.
"You would have knowingly invest in a broken cryptocurrency.

Yeah.  He also said SegWit was a scaling solution.  It is, just a lousy one.
"Yes, but the mempool transactions are dropped, are they not?

As of .12, it was said they drop after 72 hours of not being confirmed. 

From Peter himself:
https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/43155/do-unconfirmed-transactions-expire-after-some-time

So, someone would have to be resending them, to keep them in the mempool, which is possible.

But to the point of your issue, the median value is also increasing.  If the number of 1s stayed stagnant and the 8s were not increasing, this would not move upwardly, as it is. Further, these are the confirmed transactions, the one that were not left to rot in the mempool, so the 1s are not even factoring in to it.

And fine, you are not a theist, but are you political? Are you human?"
I'm basing it on the fact that Segwit2X plans have been cancelled for that exact reason (official statement). But for you it's another conspiracy.. right?
"That is the reason of why I diversificate my investment.

It's another reason the decimal point should be moved. A bitcoin should be selling right now for 10 bucks or so, whatever, it's arbitrary. It doesn't' feel like currency right now, not when a ""coin"" is almost 20k.

"99% of people don't give a fuck about decentralisation. They say they hate banks because is trendy to do so, but use them happily anyway because ""something else would be dangerous"".

They don't know anyithing about Bitcoin's properties, the ""digital currency"" category is their understanding of the technology.

They will see this as: ""oh so all banks are finally using this Bitcoin digital cash system, and my fees are lower and I can pay a soda can with my phone. Oh that's great!""

But nothing fundamentally will change.

Today is a very sad day for Satoshi. He created the tool the enemy is going to use for enslaving us all."
That's the only chance we have.
I'm with you, I was just estating what they're doing with Bitcoin.
"""Be your own bank"" so you can beg bankers to let you use things from your bank."
"No, that's not what I'm saying.

In order to have 10 million (more realistic than billion) dollars in dogecoin: approximately 3 billion. That's roughly average daily volume traded.

Because you're buying up all the liquidity of doge on the market the price will move the market up by 5-50%, because traders will think there is a pump going on. Now, once the other party wants to sell, it goes the other way around. The market will think it's crashing and thus the price moves down. Thus your spread between buying and selling could be 10+%. Thus you lose millions in the spread to move 10 million. This is shared cost between the two parties, but still creates a problem for large transactions. The fact that you used $0.01 instead of $10 to send the doge is negligible.

With BTC the liquidity is so high it would virtually not move the price in any direction. You can get 650 BTC relatively easily. The spread will be well below 1%.

With larger volume coins, the spread is lower, but still high. So the large the amount the more beneficial to use BTC.

Now, you may ask, why do you need to buy it or sell it at all? Well, the reality is large purchases usually include at least a partial buy or sell on one side. It's unlikely / rare that both parties have the available coins and willing to keep them fully, especially not alt coins. Usually there is a seller who wants crypto for his stuff, and thus willing to give a deal to receive it, but the buyer doesn't have it yet, so he has to buy it on an exchange. Or the buyer has crypto, but the buyer needs to cover some other cost from the incoming coins, so they have to sell at least some for dollars."
It's called astroturfing. Trying to make it seem like there is grassroots support for something nobody wants. I've been to a few bitcoin conferences, and you never meet small-block proponents in real life. They're only online. Which makes me think they're fake and/or paid.

">  a currency created by someone for its own personal interests, exploiting the excuse that suddenly the Bitcoin wasn't the Bitcoin anymore, trying to divide the community.

So...the end goal was to divide the community?

No. The answer is very simple, it is to scale Bitcoin according to the white paper. 

The end goal was always to make a profit by creating a peer to peer cash system that scales on chain to reach billions of users. The coins on that network will be worth millions. That is the reason for scaling to make Bitcoin Cash and scaling on chain. Not to ""divide the community."" You've been listening to too much core propaganda..."

BTC currently stands against everything cryptos were made for they censor their reddit and have a centralized development of the code base. http://www.ofnumbers.com/2017/11/13/bitcoin-is-now-just-a-ticker-symbol-and-stopped-being-permissionless-years-ago/

"You've drunk too much kool aid.  I helped create bitcoin cash.  So did a lot of other people.  It wasn't some pyramid hierarchy with 1 guy duping all of us.  I volunteered my time as did a lot of others.  

We'd been waiting for years for Core to DO SOMETHING.  The network has been broken for 2 years now.  All we got are lies and excuses.

An entire army of people were fed up with Core's excuses and lies and we finally got together and did something about it.

The only interests we all served is OUR OWN.  We want to be free from the shackles of banks and we want a crypto that works TODAY.

Bitcion adoption is just about dead.  Merchants are jumping ship.  

We shall see if this ""store of value"" thing works out -- it just may.  In which case, great.

If it doesn't -- ETH and other cryptos will eat our lunch.

Bitcoin Cash was created to hedge against that so that an actual bitcoin can still exist that is in line with Satoshi's original vision of a global ON CHAIN world crypto.
"
"Lol...  
Core before:  
1. Miners doesn't matter.  
2. If you don't like what we do fork off.  
Core now:
1. Miners still doesn't matter but if they switch then its an attack.  
2. Forking is a scam but we believe Bitcoin Gold is really good.  

I read you want regulated markets ( What isn't market then anymore but socialist BS ).  
So guess wont waste much time with you, I started to use Bitcoin in 2011 to get rid of statists BS.  
Try ripple, sounds more like the coin of your choice."
You're assuming people care about using it. They don't. That's why all this unconfirmed stuff means nothing. BTC is a buy and hold. Utility means nothing unfortunately. 
"And by lose market share we don't mean some abstract notion either.  ETH started to shoot up and eat our lunch as did a bunch of other alts.

Bitcoin dominance was like 85% back then.  Hitting the tx cap basically strangled bitcoin starting then.
"
Got it! Makes sense!
Isn't r/bitcoin is heavly censored?
People are so blinded by the price.  
Now it is, right?
"> https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#all

anybody know what caused the record high on may 19th?"
"it is definitely already a record when you consider the dollar value of the transaction fees

12th of November 18:53 UTC: 227.6 BTC @ ~6200 USD = **1,411,120 USD**

7th of December 16:51 UTC: 98.4 BTC @ ~16,600 USD = **1,633,440 USD**

and this time they can't even blame the BCH EDA for it

(I used the coinmarketcap average for the price)

Best pseudo-sarcasm I've read this week
217k right now. We'll reach ATH way before weekend.
How long does it usually take for all transactions to reset? 
Over 200k now....
"Bitcoin (BTC) is very popular right now
"
Weekend? Any minute now lol
Reached 225k earlier today
[deleted]
The question is how many txs at what fee rate. How many are unconfirmed even at >200 sats/byte, for example. A billion txs at 0.01 sat/byte wouldn't really affect usability. 
194k!
Tonight it seems.
Weekend??? What about before the end of the Day???
Probably before! It's already past 180k :D
Serious question.. If the ATH is 231k unconfirmed transactions and it did *nothing* to damage or slow down Bitcoin in the long term, why is anyone expecting a different result this time?
Isnt it great to see such high demand for the network!
"*Invest in ATHcoin!! It's skyrocketing!!!*

*I don't know how crypto works but high numbers = good right??*"
"To the mooooon!

I'm bullish on the mempool.  We broke out and are about to hit an ATH!

YAY!
"
Yawn. Nobody cares. Go play with your worthless Bcash.
"Enough with the fee and unconfirmed tx  already...nobody fucking care assholes !! 

Bitcoin is more than doubled since November, get it though your thick skulls idiots !!"
"Get it through your thick Skulls that, there's the time and place.  Nobody stupid enough to use bitcoin as a mean to make purchasing Of any kind !!   

Bitcoin right now is just simply a store of value.  They look forward into the future to Lightning Network when it get implemented, then you can buy whatever the heck you want for next to nothing in fee.. we have been through this debate long time ago..,accepted your ignorance and move on ! Don't be such a sore looser !!"
Does anyone on rbitcoin actually hold coins in a wallet they control?
It's because it happened in the past on a larger scale before.. (240K or 340K...). Then it cleared. Probably some concerns may start at 500K unconfirmed transactions.
We all care. But thanks for assuming!
Umm cause everyone there has already moved on to SegWit
Eh, the buying and selling is happening on exchanges, not from wallet to wallet.
"On one hand I feel sorry for those who bought 1 BTC as an investment for 10$k+ hard earned dollars, but when I see them laughing about how they're already up 300$ in one day and how rich they're going to be... yeah no. 

Some people have to work for money, you can't just buy into BTC and be sure it will still rise in value despite the problems."
"Yeah, in that case all you can do is pay a very high price (1000 satoshis) and perhaps even use an accelerator on top of that, and bribe your way past some of the queue.

https://pushtx.btc.com/#/ for instance."
"Been there, done that.  It is anxiety producing, but they will eventually confirm or get dropped.  Sure, by then the current price might be a tenth of what you were hoping to exit at.  Honestly, if you are just in BTC for the gains, you should just keep your coins on an exchange.  Forget being your own bank, ignore the risk of such an action, just keep them there and hope that the Exchange does not also lose the ability to withdraw to USD.

That or just send a $50 fee with your coins and pray that is enough to confirm today."
"These kind of statements sound like Pump and Dump.

I feel sorry for anyone who thought BCH was going to work. I learned my lesson early on with the 50 forks I've delt with over the last 9 years."
With more forks and futures coming up idk if that's a good idea.  I'd wait until the end of the month
Can you explain what you mean about flipping Bitcoin to bitcoin cash? And why that's so great?
"Shit.  I'm wondering if I should transfer all my coins into GDAX today and let them sit there on some sort of stop loss order (I forget if GDAX even supports this, but given the shady USDT shit, it's the only exchange I'll use now)...
"
Hi, I'm trying to wrap my mind around all the bitcoin vs bch pros and cons, i do see why BCH is better than BTC in its current form but when the lightning network comes out wont that make them much more equal? Also, just had this article shared with me today about the lightning network - https://www.coindesk.com/lightning-last-test-shows-bitcoin-scaling-solution-almost-ready/ seems like its coming out sooner than expected, I'd love to hear some opinions on this
But isn't the lightning network also decentralized?
Fuckin A right
I'm astonished by the situation. I'm expecting the same, but it will hurt all coins. Luckily the hodler mentality is less present in BCH, making the butthurting less painful.
Can someone fucking explain what's going on. I'm holding Bitcoin to grow my money not transact. Is this bad why are you guys shitting on it.
"There are limits on the mempool size which are set by each node.  Also, each node can set minimum fee levels below which it won't accept entries into its mempool.  If a node is correctly configured with regard to the hardware it's running on it should not crash when the mempool fills up.  (But this assumes the code handling the limits isn't buggy, and I wouldn't trust this.)  There is no single limit on the size of the mempool, since there are thousands of nodes each with their own limits.

As to transaction rates.  If the network can clear 5 transactions per second and transactions arrive at 6 transactions per second, then the number of transactions will grow by 1 transaction every second (on average).  This would go on to infinity, with no more increase the the transaction rate required provided reality didn't set in.  Reality would set in two ways:  the limits set by nodes are reached, or customers quit making transactions.   As an example of how this works, assume each user will limit himself to a single outstanding transaction.  Under this assumption the number of transactions in the mempool will be limited by the number of customers, ..."
so LN claims that transactions will be fast, but it wont fix the fees right?
Buut LN will be able to process 150k in 1 second and we're saved right? How could it possibly not work.
"People aged 5 have no proper concept of money, much less fees.

Dang, people aged 25 don't."
If you want to move your bitcoins from a wallet to another (not on an exchange) itll take a while and/or youll have to pay a slightly big fee for the transaction to confirm asap. It might be around $5 to $15. Obviously if youre looking to pay for coffee, that transaction cost is not good. But if youre looking to transact $50000 overseas and cash out in a foreign currency then you dont need to bother with a $5-$15 fee and a few hours delay.
Bitcoin was never designed to be this congested.  The mempool is kept in RAM.  As the unconfirmed transactions rise the cost of running a node goes up sharply since RAM is expensive.  Either that or your raspberry pi node crashes. No explicit protections via code.
As I understand, there's no limit to the mempool. However, after some time (4-5 weeks if I'm not mistaken), the transaction will just be dropped from the mempool.
"> meme pool

lol"
"I'm not aware of any limit. Unprocessed transactions however will be dropped by the network.
""Actually in Bitcoin core 0.12 the ""-mempoolexpiry"" parameter was introduced which is set to 72 hours by default. So majority of 0.12 users will drop the transaction after 72 hours. Though anyone can re-broadcast the transaction so I can't see the use of this parameter.""
"
All the Bitcoins freshly bought for 15k are sitting on exchanges now. When Tether situation explodes or any other possible issue, those will be gone forever. So does the trust towards to the crypto world for a while.
"bitcoin is popular right now  with a lot of new users buying as you can see from 27% rise in last day, the mempool will clear in due time. 
"
"The future of bitcoin is going to be through exchanges and banks, just like USD.(at least until technological solutions come)

Alt coins will be completed over the blockchain. The demand right now should be finding the alt-coin that does this best.

"
"""It's used as a currency""

""People are paying for goods with it worldwide""


Yeah.. no."
I can't wait for LN. Instead of paying a $20 fee on my transaction, I'll pay $20 to open a LN channel, and then another $20 to close it. Such progress! Much innovation!
They can't.

Holy sh... 200k.
Incredible we don't even know IF its gonna work
Haha because people actually buy it. 
Ha. The one Canadian trying to cash out. 
When is the last time someone received a confirmation for a recent transaction. I submitted my 2.5 hours ago and still none. Just wondering how long the wait is. 
So, ether should hit 10k if we can get the pending pool up 5x?
"I knew it! I was bullish on the bitcoin mempool!  ATH baby!

184k+ now
Cool, at this rate, by next week bitcoin will be worth $25,000 each and we'll have 250,000 unconfirmed transactions.
How does that map get generated??  The transactions don't have any sort of location information attached, do they?  Or are they only transactions originated at blockchain.info and they're pairing up transaction ids with IP addresses?
96% of all miners (Scroll down -> https://fork.lol/pow/hashrate) are working on BTC at the moment, and the pool of transactions is growing > 173k. Do you think a shop can serve customers if the queue is constantly growing? Who is going to stay in the line for days? Do you accept that poor people have to stay at the end of the queue, watch it growing from the back and actually never be served?

"Imagine holding 10-15 coins in a USB wallet and trying to send it to an exchange to cash out

"1 BTC > 10 BCH, Christmas came early this year! Time to flip some more BTC for BCH. 

You know the euphoria is real when money is just pouring in BTC, despite 150k+ unconfirmed transactions, businesses (ex. Steam) dropping BTC left and right, and promises of LN ""just around the corner"" after years of development. 

Yeah, I'm firing up the popcorn, this will get ugly when reality strikes back. Meanwhile, enjoy the ride!  "
"I went to sleep at 130k, as I type this now it's almost 180k.  Im a noob so excuse me if this is a dumb question, but has the steady state transaction rate on core gotten to the point where it will keep increasing and never clear?  

If I'm interpreting some stats from blockchain.info correctly, the last time it hit these levels in November, it looks like it was affected by a drop in hashing power, but this time it seems to be driven purely by transaction rate and that doesn't seem to be going down enough to let the unconfirmed pool start to shrink .   The number of unconfirmed has been a straight line up over the last 24 hours.  "
haha and people still buy this hoping LN will save the day. I cant believe
What does this mean? ELI5 please
No history until 231k+ unconfirmed transactions (June, 2017).
Can the mempool grow indefinetly, or is there a size limit for how many unconfirmed transactions you can have?
How is this thing not broken yet? I no longer seem to share reality with whatever is at the other end of my ethernet cable.
The fact that nobody at r/bitcoin gives a shit about this is beyond me.

Up to 175K now. The most I saw was ~230K around summer time. 
Simply false. Not history. [ATH is around 230k unconfirmed](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#all). Maybe we'll reach ATH within the weekend. Yikes.

17 hours later and not a single confirmation, so is my bitcoin just locked up until the transaction expires after 72 hours? I can't do anything to cancel it and try again with a higher fee?
So if I have 10 bitcoins, how do I get cash for them?
Lightening network lol 
"https://blockchain.info/unconfirmed-transactions down.

https://i.imgur.com/J9wQRMu.png

Memepool exploded!"
I don't understand, the reason why there are so many unconfirmed is because not enough people are mining right?
Ok I'm out of my depth here, my friend gave me a paper wallet a few years ago with like .05btc and I've been passively watching this. How can I can i hauck it before the crash?
"190k.

Death spiral time?"
But the price keeps rocketing ..all logic gone
"But fees aren't that high (calculating 2.511 * 15500 = > 38920 / 150119 = 0,26 cents on average fees.  Some here may still consider this high. and for some countries this is high (countries that live by the 1 dollar a day standard). But most people aren't really concerned by paying 26 cents. 

I don't know if my calculations are off, or the fees are gonna rise later on. but seeing the situation now. People are only waiting longer (which by itself is not good) but aren't paying high fees (which people will feel harsher than a few hours of waiting). "
"Dont worry, is spam ;)"
Bch is going to EXPLODE on this btc consolidation / reversal.

The record is 231k and yet here we are with BTC around ATHs. Stop this noise around unconfirmed txns meaning anything. History has proven it means absolutely nothing.
"I think the record is 240K .. (or 340K .. I don't remember atm).

Come on - its 3 transactions a second.  No technology can handle that right?
This is not going to end well
200k now
Welp
Transactions take about 1 hour as of now
"Nearly up to 200k now. 

Question, if the price starts crashing and its not cost effective to mine Bitcoin vs Bitcoin Cash and a huge percentage of miners switch over, can we hit a feedback loop of bitcoin being really not functional for a couple days until a new difficulty adjustment? "
And don't forget Tether.
That's a bannin'
"Was 230k May 19th.

The last big one was Nov 12th - it got to 178k, had 222BTC in fees worth $1.4m at the time.

If you look at https://fork.lol/pow/hashrate you can see that it was likely caused by a migration of over 60% of hashrate to BitcoinCash.

Today the mempool is just about to hit the same level as november in transaction count - its already bigger in MB terms and has about $1.2m in fees.

However this time around the bitcoin chain is operating at its typical max hashrate. (about 90% of total)

This could easily force the same situation as May 19th. Its not looking good."
Real answer: /r/bitcoin censors any and all conversations the mods there don’t like. 
Probably not!
I do.
"shhhh they all run nodes on their PI's  
Thats important so they can verify their own transactions they can't make! :-p"
You must be retarded to hodl BTC in a wallet. What should you do if you need to sell and blocks are full again?
Yes. This is why.
Yea and when that lambo ticker changes to fee/lambo instead of btc/lambo and it reaches 1:1 parity,  they're as happy as any bitcoiner can ever be
So true, now excuse me while I wipe away my tears with this stack of banknotes 
That was the first time BTC hit 1MB blocks. After that it started losing marketshare and the tx/s dropped, so it managed to clear the backlog. 
Well usually a block takes a few thousand and it takes roughly 10 minutes to get a block. So clearing this up might take a while, even if no new transactions come in.
Kinda enjoy the live ticker, saves me the hassle to check every time. Thanks! :)
"That's why we have this: https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#8h

Currently there are over 111k at 100 sat/byte and above. There is basically none under 1 sat/byte."
I was trying to make a moderate estimate, if this keeps up we might see 1 million soon.
190k in 44 minutes from your comment. This is going to be the most intense asset bubble maybe of all time. 
"Yeah the map is basically bogus.. or at least very very error-prone (low signal to noise ratio).

I actually don't know how they do it but if I were to design a system I would do the following: have a bunch of 'feeler' nodes connected to a bunch of different nodes located in all the regions around the world (location based on IP) and have all the feeler nodes listen for TX's.  The nodes communicate with each other using some extra sidechannel protocol so they can figure out who saw which TX first. 

Sort of like triangulating the TX's origin point based on how fast it propagated and in which directions.

This is unreliable though unless you try and connect to EVERY node on the network -- because if you miss a node a tx may appear to come from say China when really it came from a node in Australia that the China node was connected to.  Add to that --lots of tx's come in from TOR networks which are anyone's guess about actual location.

So yeah, it's mostly bogus... but makes for a pretty picture.
"
"Because last time it hit 190k it was due to the BCH EDA that miners left the BTC pool temporarily. And the Time it hit 231k it was because blocks were full for the first time and it only cleared because people moved away from BTC. 

This time BTC has 95% of the network hashrate from the get go."
"It did damage Bitcoin... In case you didn't realize before, Bitcoin had over 90% marketshare and it was unnecessary to buy any altcoins. Today Bitcoin has around 50% marketshare and its marketshare has been declining year after year. This kind of impact is not instant because there are always new dumb people.

Give it another 2 years and its marketshare may erode down to less than 15%."
"I bet if BCH would reach that kind of demand they would complain that the 8MB blocks are only filled to 4MB and that we're incapable of actually filling them.

So yeah more power to them! I guess they're winning after all! /s"
somebody should release mempool's currency

"So has BCH, so... 

215000 unconfirmed transactions and growing uncontrollably is pretty bad. No matter how much of a BTC zealot you are."
97.82% of all miners (Scroll down -> https://fork.lol/pow/hashrate) are working on BTC at the moment, and the pool of transactions is growing > 200k. Do you think a shop can serve customers if the queue is constantly growing? Who is going to stay in the line for days? Do you accept that poor people have to stay at the end of the queue, watch it growing in front of them and actually never being served? Please answer for my last question. Can you read at all? by the way how did you do linebreak in your comment?
Giusus, I have a legit question for you. Why do you allways defend core's bullshit so strongly? It would only make sense if you couldn't see beyond your own nose, or if you were a paid forum shill.
With LN you are inviting a 3rd party and chain yourself to it. You are giving up your freedom over the money and decentralisation for a promise from a group who DOES NOT DELIVER.
"> Probably some concerns may start at 500K unconfirmed transactions.

Isn't the ATH around 160k? It just hit 158k at the time of writing this.

Edit: ATH was 191,000 on the 5th of December this year. We just hit 161,000 at the time of writing this."
Is there anywhere to see where the most Tether transactions have been occurring? I'm assuming Bitfinnex is the place. The issue of them being able to create hundreds of millions of dollars Tether out of thin air that are supposedly back by USD with no proof, and then convert them to BTC is baffling. 
bitcoin cash has a 6-month hard fork cycle now, so anything is possible
Surely blockstream monopolizing its development, a company backed by bankers, makes it trustworthy.
It's pretty clear you shouldn't be involved in Bitcoin (concept) at all.
Oh woops, thought we were on r/bitcoin for a second
Not only not functional but a number of folks who suddenly want to cash out will realize they're trapped.
The Auto Difficulty Adjustment of BCH won't let it. BTC just reached an artifical bottleneck, it was not ready for mass adoption at the current state.
I just got done withdrawing .4 BTC at a time from bittrex. 0/10 would not recommending.
">  Exchange does not also lose the ability to withdraw

*stresses*"
"No, they are facts about BTCs mempool being a disaster. I feel bad for you if you are investing and don't know what a mempool is.

Don't you dare try and turn the blame back on BCH like shills always do. Focus on your own coin and try to argue backed up transactions are good"
"These guys in this sub are following the cult of Roger ""I'm a millionaire what are you"" Ver.   This guy has gotten his cult all worked up thinking that one day bcash will be worth more than bitcoin and will overtake bitcoin in total market cap.  Hence the term ""the flippening"" .  Funny thing is that Ethereum folks were praising the flippening not too long ago when they thought ETH would overtake BTC, and it got pretty close for a moment.

So yeah, just as this stupid sub stole the idea of bitcoin and are trying to still the name of bitcoin, they also took ETHs flippening thing and adopted it for themselves.

I mean that whole article is based on a fundamental lie, its kind of incredible the balls they have to even think they can get away with saying that. Also coindesk is the buzzfeed clickspam blog of bitcoin so I wouldnt bother reading anything they publish"
No, it won't. LN changes game-theoretical security model for the worse
Haha. Sounds ridiculous. Will lightning be used when moving in and out of exchanges? If that's still gonna be on chain, cant wait to see how backlog will increase. Backlog is 90 % funds moving back on forth from exchanges atm. 
Then you get to be a pioneer in microtransactions when you go to pay taxes.
inside the lightning network the fees will depend on the number of hops you have to take but in general will be so low that even 0,01$ transactions are feasible. Assuimng that adoption of LN will grow the number of transactions on the main chain will decrease and thus lower the fees again. So far the theory
If LN can offer off-chain transactions this will free space on the chain for standard transactions. If there's less competition for transactions then the average fee per transaction will decrease.
It will probably work if it's mostly centralized I think.  So it's good and bad :/

I paid huge amounts of fiat to move my btc to bch, shit was crazy high...
Wouldn't the OS page it out to the hard drive? Lucky that only have 1mb blocks so magnetic media can cope.
which happened in the past, what a shame. a thing like that can never happen with bitcoin cash. not because not enough people use it right now, but because even if number of transactions reached parity with btc, even 0 fee transactions would get confirmed.
Crap :D
I am pretty sure this got increased to 2 weeks.
If Tether explodes why would Bitcoin on, say, GDAX, disappear forever?
Largest previous mempool that I can  find is ~230k txs. We're almost at that right now, and it's still climbing.
They hate bitcoin here. They want bitcoin cash to be bitcoin and they're salty about it.  I appreciate where there thoughts are, but I'm not trying to buy coffee, I'm trying to buy retirement.

No spiral will start to happening just yet till the price rises. The price is a crucial part of the mining profitability. As soon as it drops or starts rising, that will make it less profitable so hashpower would go to BCH. At that point spiral would only start if people are trying to withdraw BTC from the exchanges, generating much more TXs. This will be a long run.

Attaching 3rd party technology(service) will kill the decentralised state. You are giving away your freedom over your money for what exactly? For a broken promise.
There are services where you can give them your TX id, and pay in BCH so they can handle your TX with priority.
"Instead of panic selling, you can also just sit this one out. BTC will continue to go up in 2018. Well, unless it totally crashes and becomes a second class currency but that's not super likely.

"Depends on how much you paid.

Consider using an accelerator service if you really need it to move."
175k+ and counting...
This is bad. 97% of miners and the tx keep flying up of unconfirmed.  
You can sell the private key and sign a contract that you wont use it. Or you pay a HUGE fee and wait a lot while it is being processed towards an unreliable exchange or to someone else's wallet.

The tech I was working with was handling 30-160k/sec/geolocation. It is possible. I appreciate sarcasm though.
Did anything happen to the price when it got that high?
It's 200k right now. An hour later.
Really? It just renders BTC useless. Can't confirm any transaction and over the top fees. The only thing BTC has going on for it are noobs and people who follow the hype.

Do you think a shop can serve customers if the queue is constantly growing? Who is going to stay in the line for days? Do you accept that poor people have to stay at the end of the queue, watch it growing from the back and actually never be served?
"If this would be true, the fee pr transaction graph would not be going up.

Nope, the whole market will tank.
No, it's because even with everyone mining, the amount of transfers is so high they can't keep up. The mining difficulty also went up 18% just yesterday, and it's been growing ever since. All the hash rate is online and mining, it's just not enough.

"Like the other poster commented, it is not about the fees in the pool, it is the transactions that get confirmed and that is pretty high:
https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactionfees.html#3m"
This is the bottleneck of the technology. Core developer team designed this so they can implement a 3rd party solution which would compromise decentralisation. This is the debate between BTC and BCH. BCH implemented the solution which does not make you rely on a 3rd party hence the propaganda hates it.

97.82% of all miners (Scroll down -> https://fork.lol/pow/hashrate) are working on BTC at the moment, and the pool of transactions is growing > 200k. Do you think a shop can serve customers if the queue is constantly growing? Who is going to stay in the line for days? Do you accept that poor people have to stay at the end of the queue, watch it growing in front of them and actually never being served? Please answer for my last question.

"You're including transactions that will never confirm (or confirm in a couple of weeks at best) in your average, that's not very representative.

https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/ shows a more accurate story: 121-130 satoshis per byte is the lower end of what will confirm in approximately one day (assuming fees don't increase further). For an average transaction, that's $10 USD.

The average fee doesn't matter (for people who want timely confirmation), the marginal fee that lets you get high enough in the queue is."

I hope...
No, not really - i'm saying its not economically logical to do so for small amounts, though some may still choose to use it for other reasons (political/emotional).  For large transactions, i think it works great.
I don't think a lambo is even big enough of a purchase to justify the fee.  And you'd have to put the lambo on a tab before they'll let you drive off with it.
It implies that bitcoin would have a place in their basket of reserved currency.
Mad your shitcoin isn't even worth $2000? 
I've been dumping the last of my holdings for bitcoin cash. It actually works.
I think they want to get this pig as fat as possible before they slaughter it (possibly via futures). This cow will get milked. The sharks are approaching. Bears have been hiding for over a year now and I am starting to hear angry growls from the woods.
Is LN not considered scaling?  I'm sure we can agree that it may not be the best way to scale, but it will at least help *some*, right?
No. This growth in price is NOT natural. It's all fake because if tethers and banks. If Bitcoin wasn't hijacked a d actually had a natural grow, it wouldn't be so volatile so fast and would be working perfectly for commercial use. Blockstream and banks just did their best to cripple segwit1x

"Everyone is being greedy, don't feel bad. The problem is getting out just before the top. Only 1% do, the rest free-fall to 30%, 50%, 80% less profit (or loss).

There's a saying (Warren Buffett?) that applies: when everyone is greedy, be fearful. Or in other words, sell until you stop worrying about what you still have in  BTC and see the reduced anxiety as part of the profit taking.

I for one, am protected by Kraken and its inability to meet demand. Trying to aim for the 1% is like trying to hit a fly with a broad sword. So I don't even try :). "
"> to think legacy bitcoin will survive 2 years without scaling is hilarious

just 18 months (TM) ;-)"
What's not wrong with segwit? It is a change imposed on every node and they have no way to reject it, it is a typical adware or trojan behavior, added thousands of lines of code and totally changed how bitcoin works under the hood, in fact turn bitcoin into an altcoin
lmfao, that is patently false. And no one is going to use it as a reserve. At most they will replace gold as the hedge in their portfolio making up 5% of the portfolio at most.
Of course it's not enough, no one ever said this was the one silver bullet. And I support a blocksize increase (only to like 8 mb max) so no argument here on that one. 
"> You do realize it has helped and most exchanges/wallets still need to adopt it, right?

No exchange/wallet implementation changes needed for simple blocksize increase.

> Still increasing: http://segwit.party/charts/#

Currently about 1.1 MB equivalent block size (https://coin.dance/blocks). Going for 1.7MB if 100% adoption, but does that sound enough to you?"
Of course not. Bitcoin Cash is actually pretty awesome.
I meant that it's easier to focus on one technology (or currency) for ease of use.

Wait what - the fee is like a few dollars unless you have a ridiculous number of Utxos being spent.  As a % of the purchase price that isn't even noticeable...
That is right, but in case you don't apply your thinking to the case at hand there is little use for logic.

"> Much bigger market caps as a reserve currency.

this implies there's more wealth stored in reserves than there is productive wealth in the world

Until Blockstream took over that wasn't the goal of Bitcoin.
Maybe you got downvoted because of Lambo
Bitpay better try to be the largest LN Hub instead of f*cking around with shitcoins or somebody else will and eat all their lunch
What about gold? Or bonds? Or stocks? This is dumb.
I thought it was clear they want it to be a reserve currency, not a shopping currency. Much bigger market caps as a reserve currency.
"But you can engage in commerce!  As soon as BTC fees as a % of your purchase drops below using other methods, like a credit card, then it makes perfect sense to use the coins.

Of course, this is not ideal and results in the ""minimum economic transaction"" value consistently increasing over time (as fees increase).

My point is that if you used BTC to buy a Lambo tomorrow, i doubt you would even look twice at the Tx fee because its a drop in the bucket - **but** if you were using a Credit Card it would be a sizeable amount (~$1K?)

Edit:  Do you guys just downvote when you don't agree slash don't like what someone says?  That's odd because i typically just ignore the voting arrows and instead engage in a discussion.  Wish some people would grow up :/"

"Exactly; there are so many better stores of value than Bitcoin if that’s all you want it to be. For one, a store of value is not supposed to be volatile lol."
Ah, yes, why would anyone ever use anything else than dollars (gold, diamonds, stocks, bitcoin) as a store of value when they can't engage in commerce with it. Priceless. What an idiot.
Because I'm constantly conducting commerce with my stocks, bonds, gold, real estate, etc. Yup, can't think of any reason something you don't normally conduct commerce in would be valuable.
Tell this to the people storing their wealth in PMs.
BTC as store of value and thats not bad at all. Right now the us dollar is still the transactional currency of choice. The day that Amazon or Walmart starts accepting BCH is the day the game changes.

To get rich?
A tip to all you bcash suckers and roger ver: If you want to grow bcash focus on making it good and STOP focus on negative news for bitcoin. Negativity no matter in what form will spread into your own coin which is unproductive. 
No need to imagine, they're doing it anyway. 
when did he say this ?
Bitpay will be one of the biggest hubs in the lightning network and will become a huge money maker by collecting fees for routing as well as for facilitating millions of commercial sales every day.
They should start supporting Bitcoin Tabs.
Yes, Stephen Pair, it's hard to imagine why you are doing this. /u/spair
In other words, nobody is using BitPay because nobody is using Bitcoin
"The reason for people to buy Bitcoin now is ""I want to get rich"". This is stated under the euphemism ""It's a store of value"". You know it's a euphemism because Bitcoin as it is, is terrible as a store of value. You never know how much value you can get out of the ""store"" on any given day. ""But it generally goes up in the long run"" - aha, so you're not storing value, you're making a speculative investment. Historically other things went up over time until all of a sudden they didn't.

Getting in to get rich is fundamentally unsustainable. Everyone is just hoping that other people do the same, but it requires larger amounts of $$ the bigger it gets. It has to have some basis of utility or it all ends badly when the market finally turns. ""Store of Value"" is not inherent utility, because it's relying on an unsustainable premise, that there will always be someone willing to pay more than the last person, perpetually, and sufficient to cover fees and inflation."
It's easy to imagine. They want to get rich and sell them to someone else.
Stephen, shut the f up and implement BCH.
Big words for a guy who is the CEO of a company currently only offering BTC integration to commerce.
"If Bitpay want to make money by facilitating people engaging in commerce, it's  hard to imagine why they haven't added other coins to their payment software already.

Steam may not have packed it in if the $$$ were still rolling in from purchases made in crypto."
"BitPay should integrate Bitcoin Cash in their POS solutions. 

And, just as important, they should stop supporting BTC.

It's just better UX to have 1 currency."
"""Greater fool theory"". Investing in overvalued assets, hoping someone will buy it for a higher price. When enough people realise it's shit, panic selling starts.."
Repeating my comment from lower down for more visibility: they're working on it per https://hypepotamus.com/news/bitpay-30m-series-b/
Segwit is too little too late, and seems its role was to stall increasing the transaction throughput. LN seems to be the same thing: a reason to stall. No reason that I can think of not to increase the blocksize while waiting for other better scaling alternatives. If LN turns out to be a great solution, that's fine, but it is sad to see that so many have been convinced of stalling being an ok solution.
If they were bitcoin maximalists, they would not have enabled alts. They would just have switched to bitcoin cash and disabled the most overpriced alt around...

You might be right. You might also be wrong, and one plausible explanation is that new investors do not have a clue about the underlying problems, and that there is a working solution already gaining adoption.

Better sell all your Bitcoins, and buy more Bitcoin Cash. For the inevitable crash and flippening.
"I agree that we should have doubled block size while waiting for LN, I really don't see a good reason why not other than the whole ""slippery slope"" blocksize argument which isn't great. 

Also I really do think LN will help, but again it's not the only solution we need (and Roasbeef will tell you that himself). "
Irrational exuberance with rapidly deteriorating fundamentals. Yep. I'm out.
So I’m wondering the same thing.  If BTC is so useless (and I think it’s usefulness diminishes as its price increases), why are people still buying it up?

Pretty sure a lot of the upwards price of Core coin is from banks trying to keep their investment from dying a chain death.
