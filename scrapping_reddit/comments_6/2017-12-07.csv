"Sorry I don't really understand what you're asking. I should probably clarify that I am NOT in favor of cryptos.

Not sure what you mean by ""fixing deflation"". Do you mean how would you pay? If the crypto deflates enough, I guess you could create a fork that's of a lower denomination."
"I mean that it's much more convenient to pay in money that fluctuates very little compared to something that fluctuates a lot.

"
But the point is we at least have the option to carry cash.
I would never use such a system. It's bad enough now that we are forced to use this worthless fiat monopoly money, but at least they can't confiscate your cash or remove your ability to use it (even though they steal from us by devaluating said cash with inflation). 
Was all good until the last paragraph about leaving steam because of btc
"Yeah sure that's the point if you're a dreamer.

But the reality is that bitcoin isn't recognized as a currency except by specific services that will essentially cash out your bitcoin and pay whoever you're trying to pay.

If I'm Steam why would I ever accept bitcoin when all of the things I want to buy can't be purchased with bitcoin and must first be turned into a legitimate currency?

Not to mention the fact that if I'm Steam there's virtually no reason for me to accept Bitcoin itself as a payment option because my revenue sees almost no relevant increase if I do."
"Sounds like something, that someone would say, who invested in a coin and then a few years later had to change their mind about, what it is to be peer to peer digital currency.

"These ""whale hoarders"" havent done anything wrong. It is the free market. If they want to buy an asset they can do so. If they want to sell it, they can do so as well. They can only dump their coins once. As time goes by, if people adopt bitcoin and are paid in bitcoin, the coin distribution will be much more level and the volatility in the price will be reduced greatly. These are growing pains right now
"
"The issue you are talking about is more for companies that want to engage in speculative activities. Most companies today (like Steam) aren’t interested in playing that game.

A typical US based retail company would more than likely convert to USD immediately and record it as such on their financial statements at the time of transaction. They must also account for the gain or loss from foreign currency transactions (which Bitcoin is) that occurred as a result of exchange rate fluctuations between the time the sale was recorded and payment was received, modern accounting systems automatically do this for established currencies and it’s usually relatively small fluctuations (per transaction) due to price stability. Not the case with Bitcoin.

"You are assuming the currency will be growing 10,000%. This is unrealistic. If a currency became widely adopted, everyone would be transacting in it for all purchases. The value would only increase as much as society value increases as well.

Another point, If everyone was using the deflationary currency, you wouldn't be measuring value in another currency's units either. You would be talking about the dollar value of pizza, you would be talking about how many bits instead."

"Don't listen to these keynesians and their horror stories of the deflationary boogeyman. We used commodities as money for thousands of years, gold and silver, which essentially have fixed supply.

Their argument of ""no one would be willing to spend money because it is going to be more valuable"" is bullshit. If that were true, then people wouldn't be buying new electronics today as they could get them in 6 months or a year for cheaper. People will still spend money, they just will be making a conscious choice that it may be more valuable in the future so they might not be spending wastefully. When you have an inflationary currency, people will try to exit that currency as soon as possible. This leads to malinvestment and bubbles in asset classes. People are being forced to spend their currency for fear that it will be worth less and less each passing moment. That is not the type of money that rational people choose to use. It is the type of money that an authoritarian government will force you to use."
I'm not a trader, I think that's a gamble really. I could just as easily sell now and the price will rally tomorrow.
Yeah, but your clarification is kinda beside the point. It’s implied that one wouldn’t sell for negligible profits under normal circumstances.

Yeah, BTC isn't a usable currency for typical transactions due to its exorbitant fees, so what use does it have? Yet the price keeps going up. There's no question that it's a bubble due to speculation. I don't think I've ever seen such an obvious foreshadowing of an impending BTC crash.
"> It's not even finished yet and you're calling it broken.

"Not OP, but can help -

Currency ultimately is a tool for exchanging stuff that's hard to exchange. I want my house painted today, you want five massages next month. Those might be equal value right now, but it's a lot easier if I can just hand you $100 and then you can hand me back $20 five times.

Money supply increasing is generally good because it incentives you to use it. If I gave you a dollar and told you that you had to give me 1 cent a day until you were out of money, you'd go spend it today, not wait ten weeks until you only have 30 cents left. Inflation is less severe, but the same idea.

Deflationary currency has the problem that once someone has money, they don't want to spend it, and it's really really hard to convince them to spend it. In that situation, I buy that house painting and you never buy the massages from me. Now the town just has $100 less money going around, and money gets even more valuable, because even fewer people are spending money, so money gets more valuable.....

Currency management is largely about making sure money is growing a little, but not a looooot and definitely not shrinking.

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies generally take the position that money management is bad, and are built to 'avoid manipulation'. The problem is, that doesn't actually make them difficult to manipulate. In fact, it makes it impossible to PREVENT manipulation.

If someone tried to do with the dollar what is happening with bitcoin right now, the government could just print more, and once the person manipulating it gives up, they could take the excess back out of circulation. But nobody can make more bitcoin - at least not very quickly at all. So there's nothing anyone can do if someone manipulates it."

"Maybe I didn't word what I meant to say correctly but wtf are you talking about? 

I'm saying if I had Bitcoin and it was increasing in value rapidly I'd probably still spend some of it while keeping some in savings to grow, or burst.. 

I haven't been investing in cryptocurrency, but I have followed the Bitcoin over the last 5 years, unfortunately more recently than in the past but alas.. 

I see why you would want my business, but I guess my thinking was, if someone is willing to part with a thing that only becomes more valuable the longer you hold it (temporarily) as I doubt the btc keeps going up and never down again, I'd probably rather be taking that currency than refusing it.

Idk now that I'm not also at work and I'm thinking this out, I can see where it's not really a good move for a business to accept them.

 At the same time I think if I had say, paid for $100 of btc early on, and left it alone until now, I'd have way more. Duh. There's products I want that can be bought with btc and you even usually get a sweet discount. I'd be really psyched right now to spend some btc assuming I bought in and my 100 bucks was now worth, idk $1000+ at this point? 

I'd absolutely use them sparingly but damn if there's not stuff I'd be buying if I had btc from buying in cheap. Even buying in high I think I'd be spending at this point I'm not confident that it's gonna stay above 10k, but I don't think I know anything so if I'm totally off base with my thinking, I wouldn't mind constructive criticism. I would like to get a better understanding of the cryptocurrency market, especially if I come off as knowing nothing bout nothing. "

Yeah it's all on record but it's more like a cash exchange where you need to know the code for the transaction or else you can't trace it and that code is something that only the two people making the transaction should have access to. So they can tell others about it and then they can check which I guess is good for court but realistically I can't just go into some block chain and find some transaction you made buying a pound of weed from Canada without something else to go on. The problem up until now was that it was very hard to get money onto the internet without first going through a bank because companies really only accept credit or debit cards and sometimes bank wires. So buying drugs when your bank has a record of every transaction that courts can then demand from the bank isn't a super safe way to do things. This lead to the stolen credit/debit card market since you essentially had to impersonate someone else and pray they didnt trace it back to you. So yeah it can be traced but it's value comes from the fact that it can only be traced if one of the two party members wants it to be, or I guess if someone put a virus on your computer to track it. Or I should say initial value as the value that bitcoin currently has is way more than it should be for some drug currency, which was my whole point anyway.

"> BTC, unlike fiat currencies under control of central authorities, does not have any inherent stabilizing features

I believe this to be incorrect.  since its adoption is limited by the number of humans on the planet and the total amount of wealth needed to be represented, it naturally reaches a state where it can no longer be adopted exponentially, at which point we would expect its price (perceived value) to stabilize.

Perhaps BTC isn't the crypto which is ultimately mass-adopted.  There are so many competing cryptos out there, it's very hard to predict.  Maybe it will be Bitcoin Cash, maybe Monero.

You seem to be well informed.  You're looking at this from the supply side and that's a great start.  Let's look at the demand side.

Tell me, if an opt-in money *wasn't* deflationary, why would anyone want to possess it in the first place?

And provided that there is an opt-in deflationary money, why wouldn't some people prefer to hold onto some of it, instead of holding onto money which is guaranteed to lose value by design?

> That's not going to change. Quote me on that. Come back in the future and enjoy your ""I told you so"" if BTC ever amounts to anything (it won't).

I first heard that in 2011.   Since then cryptocurrency has only grown in adoption.  It is still very marginal: I expect global crypto adoption to require generations of humans and possibly some wars unfortunately.  But as long as people foresee a future in it, then they will continue to devote additional wealth to it.  And as long as it is super-easy and cheap to transact (definitely not always the case, see my earlier points) then sooner or later people heavy in it will want to spend it.  And there will be others eager to accept it in exchange, because it will be widely understood to have value."

"> BCore devs are essentially committing suicide because ""gigabyte blocks are unfeasible."" Well, okay. But that doesn't mean 32MB is unfeasible. Or 8MB. Or even just 2MB.

Each one of those options gives more power to people who aren't holding the majority of BCore coins, and stabilizes the cost of the coin. 

The people who are holding the majority of coins don't want people other than themselves to have power, because they won't see insane speculative returns on their ""investment"". 

BCore wants the coin to be an investment. It's a get-rich-quick scheme. They'll never be convinced otherwise. Right now it works, because there's an endless number of rubes entering the system as the price hype-train continues to grow exponentially. 

The minute a non-trivial number of people attempt to realise those gains, though... the entire thing will collapse in hours.

Change never comes until it's too late and it's forced upon us. Bitcoin is unusable as a currency, but because all the new people got into it because of the hype, that doesn't even matter to them. So maybe it will just keep rising for a long time... and these people will cash out with a profit and pat themselves on the back. But someone, some group of people will get the timing wrong, and it will plummet for them.

 I think it will take another, better crypto to become the new 'useful' digital currency, with mass media hype and a price rise itself, before BTC really collapses and the new buyers realise BTC is slow and pointless as a day to day currency, like it was originally intended to be. It might take so long for this to happen that they are conditioned into thinking BTC is how crypto is supposed to be, a speculative investment for life, that is inconvenient to use, just like online now no one cares that 18 months of browsing history is kept on a GCHQ server. 'Nothing to hide, nothing to fear' and all of the problems that come from that line of thinking. We've been conditioned to think that it's acceptable for a government to do that without any asking or public debate, for 'national security'. 

Maybe the next generation of people won't even think it's an issue that crypto is slow, heavily regulated and centralised on sidechains. They bought BTC and it went up, and now they can finally spend it. Fuck man, who knows what's going to happen. Strap in!"

Customers make many small payments.  These small payments clutter up the merchant's wallet.  When the time comes to pay bills or to consolidate his wallet, the  merchant will pay a large fee.  The fee will depend on the number of custo er payments received, not the total amount of fees.  Many small payments will be expensive for the merchant to process.
I don't disagree at all, I'm just stating what we're all seeing happen. 
Institutional hedge-fund level money is pouring in now, probably sovereign wealth funds as well. This is just the beginning. The only thing keeping it from spiking higher and faster is the limited channels to pour in huge levels of capital that are sitting on the sidelines.
It's the same from a purely economic perspective, but many studies in behavioral economics show that people don't act purely rationally when it comes to money, and in fact often act completely *irrationally*. People just don't act that way in practice. BTCs rapid appreciation makes people not want to spend it, even on things they are just buying with USD that they could have bought BTC with.

"> I believe this to be incorrect. since its adoption is limited by the number of humans on the planet and the total amount of wealth needed to be represented, it naturally reaches a state where it can no longer be adopted exponentially, at which point we would expect its price (perceived value) to stabilize.

This is not an **inherent** stabilizing feature.

This is stabilization based on adoption.

You're still caught in the same problem where no major retailer adopts currency because it isn't stable, and the currency requires adoption to achieve stability, so therefore it never reaches stability.

>Tell me, if an opt-in money wasn't deflationary, why would anyone want to possess it in the first place?

To spend it. Cryptocurrencies provide secure international transactions at no cost. There is no middle-man bank that collects wire fees. People would happily use an inflationary cryptocurrency for this alone.

Seriously, how is this even a question?

The problem is that the deflationary nature of BTC *disincentivizes* spending, and that means BTC fails at literally the #1 function of a currency.

>And provided that there is an opt-in deflationary money, why wouldn't some people prefer to hold onto some of it, instead of holding onto money which is guaranteed to lose value by design?

Sure, they might prefer that.

But what you're describing here is not a currency. It's an *investment device*.

>I first heard that in 2011. Since then cryptocurrency has only grown in adoption.

**As an investment device.**

Do you understand the distinction?

People don't buy BTC to spend it. People buy BTC to park their money and profit from the speculative booms.

It's a nice speculative investment device. It is not, however, a currency. And it will never become a currency, because it has no *inherent* stabilizing features that are necessary to promote retail adoption. There is nothing there to trigger the positive feedback loop, so it is caught up in a negative one instead."

This is also *more* in line with Gresham's law than than not spending Bitcoin, because you get rid of fiat as soon as you receive it.

Uh yes it is.  it grows until it saturates.  like any tech adoption / saturation curve.

There's always cost at the intersection of fiat and crypto.  So you have to pay the cost to get the crypto to send for free.

Cryptocurrencies only ""provide secure international transactions at no cost"" if you were *already holding them anyway.*

Get it??

> There is nothing there to trigger the positive feedback loop, so it is caught up in a negative one instead.

I do not see a negative adoption feedback loop represented [here](https://bitcoinwisdom.com/markets/bitstamp/btcusd) over any significant time period, adoption only seems to go up.

It might one day become caught in a negative adoption feedback loop but I can't find any evidence of that.  You'll need evidence if you want to keep making assertions like that.  It's fairly demonstrable that over time, more and more people hold more and more crypto.

Yes, as a speculative investment device.   It's still in the speculative phase.  Of course I understand the distinction, I've held crypto for many years, and spent very few of them.  That's because it's rather obvious to me that its incredibly undervalued.  There are many reasons to believe that a global cryptocurrency will in fact become the next ""reserve currency.""  Will that be Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash or Ethereum or some other?  No way to know for sure.  Sooner or later, one of these will however hit the magic formula, and adoption will look exactly like that chart I just showed you, because all cryptos get adopted in hype cycles like Bitcoin.

> People buy BTC to park their money and profit from the speculative booms.

Yes, more and more people do this.  Eventually, almost anyone investing money is doing at least some of this, if only as a hedge.  And eventually when enough people are doing this, then over time the risk and reward will go down, and the variability will go down, and people will see it less as a get-rich-quick scheme and more as a sensible long term thing to hold.

And when enough people are heavy in crypto they'll want to spend them, like I enjoy spending mine, and they'll seek out ways to do that.  And as this crypto becomes globally recognized and desired, merchants will offer discounts to get it, because it costs less to transact and hold.

Traders buy and sell.  You seem focused on these.  But with every wave of adoption there are more people that buy and hold.  These are not boom speculators.  What causes these people to stop buying and holding?

I guess lastly: why are you in this sub to begin with :)"

"Every traded item has variable value, whether it’s a physical good, a service, a stock, a bond, a currency, etc.

That’s not the issue.

The issue is that in order to function well, currency has to have a *relatively stable value*, *high adoption,* *high scalability*, and *very high transactional volume.*

Bitcoin currently has none of these. What it has instead is a rapidly increasing value, low adoption, limited scalability, and very low transactional volume, just like a penny stock in a bubble before it bursts.

That’s why Bitcoin is about to fail unless they can somehow magically address all of these issues right the fuck now."
"Literally everything you said about how ""BTC should do this and that if such and such happens"" is the same ridiculous fantasy that BTC apologists have been saying since its inception.

BTC will not be ""sufficiently adopted"" until major businesses are convinced that its value with respect to other assets has permanently stabilized. And its value with respect to other assets will not stabilize unless it is ""sufficiently adopted"". 

It's caught in a vicious cycle because BTC, unlike fiat currencies under control of central authorities, does not have any inherent stabilizing features. There are no monetary levers that a government can pull to combat volatility. It is entirely at the mercy of speculation, which is why it is stuck in this limbo of never becoming a legitimate currency ever.

That's not going to change. Quote me on that. Come back in the future and enjoy your ""I told you so"" if BTC ever amounts to anything (it won't)."

I don't think it would be the accounting that is the issue here but rather the fact you would need a consultant to determine if you should cash out the bitcoins and when. A lot of opportunity cost and stuff like that with holding a currency like bitcoin.
If you read the steam announcement, it mentions transaction fees being absurdly high, and BTC being so volatile. Sometimes they get more money, so they have to issue a partial refund, sometimes they get less, so they have to serve another invoice for the remaining funds.

"Deflation is bad for borrowers, but good for savers. So in a consumerist economy like we have in the western world, people would not be able to run up debts purchasing useless consumer goods. They wouldn't be able to pay back the debts.

"
That's because most economies use fractional-reserve debt money.
"Believe me, I am a big fan of blockchain tech and am very bullish on it's adoption into many industries. What I am not a fan of is speculative bubbles. Here are my thoughts:
Bitcoins have value due to the ability to trade them. They gain inherent value when more people use them. More people use them when it has a stable price. Speculation makes people who want to use it as a currency, very uneasy, hence why steam is not supporting bitcoin payments anymore. People who use it as a currency, sell it to avoid volatile prices, the people who buy are speculators. The current trajectory of bit coin makes it into a speculative medium where most bitcoins are owned by people trying to make money and not actually use it. When the drop happens, there will be less and less people using bitcoins as currency and it's inherent value will be pretty small. What rises in it's ashes may be a stabler currency, but by them an alt coin will probably take the lime light as the next hot thing. Also by that time, block chain trading of country currencies will probably be a thing.  "
The only correct choice is not to buy at all.

"> he world has played around with decentralized limited-supply currencies before. It was called the gold standard

I thought the gold standard was the start of fractional reserve banking? ie gold became paper money, and then it was realised that they could print more paper money without people actually claiming the gold. 

Bitcoin acts nothing like this....
From the wiki article 'Gold Standard'

Disadvantages
-
The unequal distribution of gold deposits makes the gold standard more advantageous for those countries that produce gold. - **Not an issue for crypto. Anyone can mine.**

Some economists believe that the gold standard acts as a limit on economic growth.""As an economy's productive capacity grows, then so should its money supply. Because a gold standard requires that money be backed in the metal, then the scarcity of the metal constrains the ability of the economy to produce more capital and grow."" - **not sure how this applies when BTC or any crypto could be infinitely divided up mathematically.**

The rest of the points seem to centre around money as debt, which is exactly what bitcoin and crypto aims to avoid. I'm not saying I don't believe what you're saying, I just can't see it yet. Can you help me understand? I don't see how money made from IOUs of gold, that add up to more than the total of real gold, is a limited-supply.
"
"> Use the bitcoin then immediately buy the bitcoin back with the easily acquired country currency. No money lost except for small amount of transaction fee.

Or just use the regular money and pay no fee and don't go through a ridiculous multi-step process just to pay for something.

It will never end with anything other than a burst.   I guarantee it.
True, but it always has been. After this bubble there will be another one even bigger etc... it has been like that since 2010.
Hmm. I had heard of this - any recommendations?
And Ethereum is better than both because it can also provide a service while being a currency and store of value
I wasn't quite asking for an ELI5, just pointing out that the previous comment was a big fail. Thanks for putting one out there though.
As a holder and believer in Ethereum I can’t wait for BTC to fall and be replaced
As bitcoin has grown from $0.01 to $14,000 the volatility has decreased. When the market cap is big enough, say as big as gold, the volatility will be similar as well. It is only during this initial growth phase where there is high volatility. How is bitcoin ever supposed to get to this large market cap if it isn't for these speculative bubbles? If you look at the history of bitcoin, it has had these bubbles over and over again. It will continue to do this until it is either replaced by a different cryptocurrency, or until the market is fully saturated and the market cap is sufficient to allow all trade.
"> Thats why BTC is not a good currency... Nobody wants to spend it.

There might be an interesting analogy to metal-based currencies of the past. Whenever a government (e.g. Rome) started reducing the silver/gold content of its coinage, the previous coins would quickly disappear from circulation as people hoarded them and spent only the cheaper coins whenever possible.

What that means for Bitcoin, I'm not sure. Maybe people will start spending it once there are vendors that *only* take Bitcoin."
"> Deflation is bad for borrowers

Thus interest rates are invented.  In an inflationary economy, borrowers pay back slightly more than they borrowed. In a deflationary economy, borrowers pay back slightly less than they borrowed. It all works out in the end.

I could pay you in Venezuelan dollars, which are rapidly going down in value. If I paid you $100(US) equivalent, next week it might be worth $50(US)

Or I could pay you in Bitcoin, which is rapidly going up in value. If I paid you $100(US) equivalent, next week it might be worth $150(US).

Which would you prefer to be paid in?

Obviously this is an extreme example.

The real reason to avoid Bitcoin isn't because it is appreciating, it's instability and risk. Because the biggest fear is that the money or investment you are holding is suddenly worth much less, people avoid anything prone to rapid fluctuations in value or boom/bust cycles -- like Bitcoin.

Right now it might be a moon rocket, but if the bubble bursts next week and the value drops in half or less, Steam doesn't want to be holding a bunch of Bitcoin and still need to pay publishers twice as much as they're worth in dollars. If the increase in value were slower or relatively stable, they'd be happy to take it."

Honest answer: money was backed by gold for decades, then silver, but since about 1970 it has been backed by nothing at all except a government ""promise"" that it has value.  A promise that has been broken, as you can see from inflation rates since that time.

The appeal of digital money like bitcoin is that the supply is determined by a mathematical formula and central authorities cannot simply create new ""money"" arbitrarily and dilute the value of existing money."

But yes, I'm not trying to be obtuse, b/c I get what you mean. So w/ the colloquial understanding in mine, BTC *does* have intrinsic value, as it's pseudo-anonymity and blockchain tech are incredibly valuable.

It's not. 
No I mean with it being speculative. The market cap tells you more about how over inflated the price is than the single units of currency.
"you want transactions *processed* in your country, easy: subsidize mining.  China seems to have figured that out long ago.

you want to *censor* transactions, you're going to have a hard time with that unless you can direct 51% of the hashpower.  So I guess the USG needs to buy a lot of miners.  but even then, China can't do it undetected, and when it's detected, then all of their miners instantly turn into very inefficient space heaters."
Oh, sorry, I misunderstood. After rereading it became clear you were talking about currency, not gold.
I agree, although I never said that it would be easy, or that even Bitcoin is slightly stable. It isn't. It's entirely speculation, not an official form of currency or payment, and isn't backed by anything trusted. There will be drops, and there will be a crash. Whether or not it will disappear, I couldn't tell you.
"Because a currency isn't valued by how much is put into it by consumer assets or people's investments, its value is based on other currencies and the countries economy, and banks that are backing it (and also backed by other things themselves). Think of it like a very well built house of cards. It ensures, that way, that at the slightest sign of hesitation or failure, that a currency doesn't just collapse and cause a whole country to go up in ruin overnight.

To the point that nearly every major country has a central national bank that isn't for day to day loans and accounts like banks are, that is there as a ""failsafe"" in case banks fall short on their amounts or interest rates or overnight payments, etc. And basically pays the deficit so things like inflation, interest rates, currency strength, etc. Don't start changing drastically.

€: Just to be clear, here, there is *some* value put into currency through investments. I.e. Forex. It's just not navigated or treated as, say, a stock would or a corporation. The influence on a currencies well being via investments is minimal, and treated to be a lot less than what it would be through other investments. Reason for that is no one wants currencies to be backed and invested upon, solely on people's investment's and buying power, versus leaving it in the hands of the financial system and mortgaged backed securities, or banks."

"> a currency that penalizes spending (which is literally the #1 function of a currency) is not actually a currency

I can see no way in which BTC penalizes spending *in the long term* provided that the fees to perform ""spending-type"" transactions are ""spending-type"" costs.

Yes it is deflationary, which is why we would expect it to eventually adopt a sigmoid adoption curve like all globally-adopted technologies, at which point its value WRT other assets should stabilize.

>  none of this stuff is ever going to become anything more than a speculative ""investment"" device.

until sufficiently adopted"
The most ironic thing here is that Eth is actually going all-in on tons of different scaling options that can work together, whereas Bitcoin is floundering to implement a single one. Yet, because Ethereum processes so many more transactions than Bitcoin between all of its dApps (including cryptokitties), it looks like it's equally bad at fast transactions.
Granted iota's future scaling seems quite bright in regards to infinite scalability without the consistent miner pool. 
"While we can’t say scaling as a whole has been a success, its at least understood in other currencies that scaling is necessary. It’s also being more widely tested. 

Bitcoin has degenerated into a community that wants to remain small and exclusive. "
eth network did more TX today than all other blockchain combined. hard to say it scales any worse than the competition 
"Yeah, for different things. Silver is used when it can be fully enclosed by another material, and copper is used when you don't need a great conductor. But when you need a highly conductive material that's exposed to air (such as in various connector pins) then gold is your only option.

"You need more {HDD space/CPU power/bandwidth} to {store/verify/download} each block. The core devs consider it important that a computer than can do that today should be able to do that just as well 20 years from now.

They consider the most important part of ""decentralized peer-to-peer digital money"" to be the decentralized part (unless you're talking about decentralizing development and code) and think that increasing the technology cost to {store/verify/download} will cause Bitcoin to become centralized."
Increasing the blocksize makes the cost of running a full node (i.e. mining) more expensive because it takes more bandwidth, more storage space, and more processing power to run the servers.  This might cause some smaller mining operations to stop mining, which results in a less decentralized network, which is more prone to attack or takeover.  In theory... 
but futures trading!

"Bitcoin needs an upgrade to allow for more transactions per second. There was/is an extremely wide-ranging propaganda and information-control conspiracy, centering around the company Blockstream and the /r/bitcoin mod /u/theymos, to prevent this upgrade from occurring.

There's no real discussion of what the motive behind this information control is, or what any of it has to do with BTC's rapid value increase, but I guess the implication is that these conspirators are likely manipulating Bitcoin markets in any way that they can and at the expense of its usability as a currency."
I always thought of it the opposite way: RBF is the justification for not scaling the block size, which results in network congestion and thus high fees.

"**Octopus card**

The Octopus card (Chinese: 八達通) is a reusable contactless stored value smart card for making electronic payments in online or offline systems in Hong Kong. Launched in September 1997 to collect fares for the territory's mass transit system, the Octopus card system is the second contactless smart card system in the world, after the Korean Upass, and has since grown into a widely used payment system for all public transport in Hong Kong, leading to the development of Oyster Card in London.

The Octopus card has also grown to be used for payment in many retail shops in Hong Kong, from convenience stores, supermarkets, fast-food restaurants, on-street parking meters, car parks, to other point-of-sale applications such as service stations and vending machines.

The Octopus card won the Chairman's Award of the World Information Technology and Services Alliance's 2006 Global IT Excellence Award for, among other things, being the world's leading complex automatic fare collection and contactless smartcard payment system.

Maybe steamcoin can become more mainstream, but my opinion is that in general, once cryptocurrency reaches mass adoption, businesses will only accept the two main cryptocurrencies (because more than that wouldn't be worth the additional effort). For example, most businesses accept MasterCard and Visa, but American Express support is much more rare. If steamcoin becomes one of the main ones, then I could see it being adopted by other businesses, but otherwise it will be used for a niche market.

"The whole point of a central bank controlling the monetary supply is supposedly to help borrowers so that the economy can always keep going. If you borrow money (which thanks to US consumer culture pretty much everyone has some agreement to pay x amount of dollars in the future with a lender) inflation helps you because what you pay in the future is less than what you agreed to borrow.

I don't think there's some sinister plot to steal from the people by inflating the currency, I think that the idea is intrinsically flawed and big banks ultimately end up winning. You only have to look at the housing crisis in 07-08 to find an example of the central banks policy creating a bubble which banks knowingly abused and mostly came out winning."

Because the idea is the adoption continues down the scope, such that if steam accepts it, steam then may be able to use it to purchase its OWN services such as CDN space, server space, developers, etc.  And this would in theory continue down the line where everyone could trade and make use of it with as little fiat conversion as possible.  Then it becomes more efficient.

"**Civil forfeiture in the United States**

Civil forfeiture in the United States, also called civil asset forfeiture or civil judicial forfeiture or occasionally civil seizure, is a controversial legal process in which law enforcement officers take assets from persons suspected of involvement with crime or illegal activity without necessarily charging the owners with wrongdoing. While civil procedure, as opposed to criminal procedure, generally involves a dispute between two private citizens, civil forfeiture involves a dispute between law enforcement and property such as a pile of cash or a house or a boat, such that the thing is suspected of being involved in a crime. To get back the seized property, owners must prove it was not involved in criminal activity. Sometimes it can mean a threat to seize property as well as the act of seizure itself.

With bitcoin, I have the known pseudo anonymity because it was widely publicized as an untraceable, anonymous currency that was safe to buy drugs with when it was first created. So we know its 'anonymous' -- we can trace transactions through the blockchain but cannot map who or what is in control of the wallets at teh destinations. Anyone could have a million wallets or 1; but we cannot be sure. Therefore, given that many people think higher transactions is better for bitcoin, I would definitely create a bot army to continuously create new wallets, dump random BTC into them, and continue on AND NOBODY WOULD KNOW IF THEY WERE BOTS OR PEOPLE.

It has to have some value proposition over the existing options. For Bitcoin up to the blocks filling up there were considerable gains in usability over existing options in many areas.

Black and grey markets are another and are still mostly Bitcoin or cash (USD, not BCH) land. Other coins have better features but none have BTC's network effect yet.

Likewise to the black market uses, bitcoin's pseudonymous nature gives it an edge in many sectors where people may not want it known that they're transacting. If you don't want your porn subscription showing up on your bank statement then something like bitcoin is very attractive. Essentially anything that you'd prefer to use cash for over a credit card if you were physically present is a use case for something with properties like Bitcoin that can be exchanged with some level of identity protection and without needing to use a third party."

"You completely misunderstand what we're discussing here.

To borrow terminology from the redditor I responded, the ""Lightning Network"" is trying to address the issue of ""vertical"" scalability. It is essentially just layering some abstraction on top of BTC to address a network bottleneck problem. This is nothing. This is small time. It's just a band-aid. It does nothing to solve the core fundamental ideological problem that dooms BTC to failure.

What he and I are trying to argue, and agree on, is that ideological problem -- ""horizontal"" scalability. That is, the money supply is finite, and therefore the currency is inherently *deflationary*. This promotes hoarding and saving, and penalizes spending. And a currency that penalizes spending (which is literally the #1 function of a currency) is not actually a currency.

The Lightning Network does nothing to address that problem. They can add a bazillion abstraction layers to this, and BTC (and any secondary or tertiary currency based on the BTC) is still going to be deflationary in nature. Consequently, none of this stuff is ever going to become anything more than a speculative ""investment"" device."
">The unequal distribution of gold deposits makes the gold standard more advantageous for those countries that produce gold. - Not an issue for crypto. Anyone can mine.

It doesn't matter that anyone can mine when the total amount of BTC available to be mined is a limited, finite quantity. Consequently, BTC is *deflationary* in nature, which promotes hoarding/saving rather than spending. And that inherently takes a big steaming dump on the most important function that a *currency* needs to perform.

>Some economists believe that the gold standard acts as a limit on economic growth.""As an economy's productive capacity grows, then so should its money supply. Because a gold standard requires that money be backed in the metal, then the scarcity of the metal constrains the ability of the economy to produce more capital and grow."" - not sure how this applies when BTC or any crypto could be infinitely divided up mathematically.

A paper currency that is gold backed is equally as infinitely divisible as BTC is. After all, there is nothing stopping the US government from stamping new coins or printing new paper that has smaller denominations than 1 cent. In fact this was one of the key reasons why the world transitioned into paper notes that were backed by precious metals. The notes could be any denomination necessary, while still being indexed to a finite commodity. That didn't stop the gold standard from being depressive on economic growth.

Ultimately, the limit on economic growth is a function of the penalty that *deflationary* currencies place on spending.  This is unavoidable. It's very basic economics. And it's why deflationary currencies can't actually be useful currencies.

I really want to stress this point: BTC is not a currency. It never was, and it never will be. It has lived its entire existence as a wildly speculative ""investment"" device. People don't buy BTC in order to spend it. They buy it to hold, and profit from the speculative booms."

I don't consider BTC to be thriving.  When less and less places are accepting it as a payment method, that is not thriving.

It's the volatility that is scaring merchants from accepting it. Imagine acquiring. Say $100,000 worth of BTC over the course of a year. It's possible that value increases intrinsically if BTC value increases, but what if it doesn't? What if it decreases by 25%? Then they're losing profit margin simply because the currency isn't stable. Their point about transaction fees is also incredibly justified, both as a recipient or refunder. 
"The only way to fix it is if the already integrated payment processors offer BCH, ETH, or other cryptos suitable for transactions. I don't get why they're dragging their feet, as it certainly is a matter of their survival.

For the merchant, the switch could be almost transparent."
I just sold earlier today. It's getting to the point that I'm starting to get on edge and I already more than doubled what I put in and I'm not going to miss on the already more than expected profit margin I made. I'm probably just going to use what I made to diversify more, leave a little in btc for a while for shits and giggles and move everything else around. I might regret it down the line but right now I feel like there's a pop on the horizon and it's scaring the shit out of me. There's just no way it can keep going up like it is.

Wrong.  You are blindly assuming Steam's ability to represent a significant amount of Bitcoin processing, both in a vaccuum and relative to China, illicit deals, the extreme trading frenzy which grows every day.  This doesn't show speculation, it shows you can't dent Bitcoin with something so small.  Steam is barely a blip compared to Silk Road and Mt Gox and look where we are now.

It's never been either. It's been a commodity like gold or frozen concentrated orange juice. Just because people call it a currency or if its creator made it as a currency, doesn't mean it's ever acted like one. And since its trading isn't regulated in any way, its price is being manipulated for profit by those with the means to do so.

Sorry, I was working and couldn't reply before.

Don't think I am trying to be condescending, I am just simplifying everything so you would understand the situation with whatever knowledge you have.

Bitcoins idea was proposed around 10 years ago in [this whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf), which specifically states Bitcoin is to be a decentralized currency. Both r/bitcoin and r/btc have been around for a long time and used to be very similar to eachother. Around 2 years ago two differently thinking camps emerged around Bitcoin, having different ideas for the future:

- (camp1) One wanting Bitcoin to scale on-chain, by making blocks in the blockchain bigger. This would mean that the currency could handle loads of transactions on the network and no organization or one group would have control over the network to profit from it (the users control the system = decentralization) and every transaction would be visible to others. This is exactly what the original idea in the whitepaper has in mind. The problem is however that the blockchain would get bigger more quickly and the nodes on the network (not ordinary users, but rather miners) would need Terabytes of storage space.

- (camp2) The other camp wants to keep blocks on Bitcoin 1MB size. This would mean limited transaction rates and thus high fees and waiting times to get your transaction through. The idea is supposedly to keep the blockchain itself small so everyone can store the data on their own devices if they want to. And moving most of transactions off of the chain onto sidechannels and something called the Lightning Network, where transactions are fast and cheap again. This move can however easily lead to companies facilitating these transactions and also benefiting off of these transactions. This is not the decentralization that the original idea had in mind and would almost be the same as nowadays banks profiting off of and controling the transactions that people make. Most people who understand the blockchain tech and want to get rid of banks hate this idea, but somehow the Core developers of Bitcoin are supporting it. A lot of conspiracies around, but people have been sniffing out some major banks and investment organizations are linked to funding the Core developers and might be pushing for Lightning Network to control Bitcoin and profit out of transactions.

This August, Bitcoin finally split into two: Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin backed by the Core developers (camp2) and Bitcoin Cash backed by pretty much the rest of the community (camp1). The moderators of r/bitcoin subreddit are mostly Bitcoin developers and have been heavily censoring the subreddit towards their liking and ideas. The r/btc does not censor and thus here you can see the community hatred towards Bitcoin and support of Bitcoin Cash.

[Bitcoin network constantly clogging up because of the 1MB block sizes seen live here.](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#2w) The upper graph shows how many transactions are waiting on the network currently to go through. Right now there are around 160k pending transactions. The average transaction fee right now is around $7. Bitcoin can never work with 1MB blocks on the chain and be a decentralized currency with low fees. The only thing it has is really at the moment, that it is ""digital gold""; ""store of value"". Bitcoin Cash with bigger block could transact much more transactions per/day, but it does not have the recognition of the average public member and not many people use it.


**TLDR**: Bitcoin split into Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash a few months ago. Bitcoin just got the name, because the original developers went that way. Bitcoin Cash follows much closer to the original idea of Bitcoin. This subreddit is pro Bitcoin Cash. We here believe it is far superior to Bitcoin."

"I lost all my dogecoin (20k? Maybe less)  when my wallet got hacked when one of the big sites went down that I used and connected wallets were emptied. Ah well. I could have had upwards of $20. 

I liked dogecoin because it was worthless. "
check out bitcoin.tax
Bitcoin Cash (BCH) fixed that. It's money again.
Kraken. Bitfinex too, maybe?
Obviously good for bitcoin.
/r/bitcoin is one of the most heavily censored subreddits on this site. You will not see anything there except full-throated enthusiasm for BTC because everything else is deleted. It's T_D of cryptocurrency.
It makes a kind of selfish sense. No one wants to spend their BTC, but they want other people to spend theirs and drive adoption, thus increasing the value of the hodlr's stash.
I'm not overly educated on bitcoin but I always thought the darknet markets supported the need for btc more than anything.
Sure gonna hurts if the only way to spend bitcoins are through heavy regulated exchanges.
It’s the mainstream effect
Apparently they all made it here to upvote their own kind. Sad!
"If you have to pay lots of taxes without any actual changes to the tax laws, you're winning.

I'd gladly pay millions in income tax, as long as I have the income that goes with it.

Likewise, having to pay an income or fringe benefis style tax on your income doesn't really affect it. You're still getting 70% of something as opposed to nothing at all."
Capital Assets are barely taxed, why would this be an issue? 
Dude clearly we would pick ethereum or/and litecoin. They are far superior coins, besides the undervalued price!
What  bitcoin cash exchange does this sub usually recommend? I am new here. 
Yeah tether volume is at 1.3 billion today.  They've printed 100s of millions of new ones over the last month or so.  Something doesn't seem right.
With the tax break coming rich. people are investing in alternative formats to stocks and bonds. 
Consider pulling out of crypto. If bitcoin bursts it’ll cryptos will fall. I doubt any crypto will rebound to usability or value again. Definitely diversify, but not all into the same market
I think federally backed crypto is the only way to go. I think crypto-currency is the next evolution of currency. But if there is no authority to back it up, then there is no reason to believe it's value. And there is no one there to catch it when it falls.
I'd even go so far as to say btc was created by govt and pumped by the media to get us to embrace the idea of a crypto cashless economy, so we readily accept it when they come out with their official govt crypto and harm non-govt cryptos with regulation.
They *did* open tabs. You could do just that
You just made it inconvenient by adding an extra step.
In my eyes, it's more the problem of volatility than anything.
That doesn’t need to be difficult. The merchant doesn’t need to be adjusting prices of items because only conversion rate changes. So if a game is $20, the merchant just needs to advertise $20 as the price. The buyer will pay the equivalent in bitcoin according to the current conversion rate. In that sense it is not unlike paying with other foreign currency. The difference here is that the conversion rate changes happen too fast for bitcoin and by the time the merchant receives the funds, the value may be way off from the time the buyer made the payment. There is no way for merchant to be able to predict what the conversion rate will be when he receives the funds. The high fees are making it impractical to use bitcoin in retail, and that is too bad — bitcoin was not supposed to be a get-rich-quick scheme.
Agreed

No, they've pivoted to a store of value rather than a way to actually buy things on a regular basis. The transaction times and fees are way too high for any sensible peer to peer use (vs other coins)
Market don't care
I think many are forgetting how long it'll take to get out of large positions... Many exchanges limit withdrawals.
Hm, that's why it just hit 14,000 dollars.
Eh it's a toy currency

Because there is no point in terms of fees or time to use it anymore. 
Why don't they embrace an alternate like etherium or monero?  
Do they except gold? Why would they accept digital gold? They should use litecoin or Iota.
Didn't even know steam accepted Bitcoin
RIP my now non-existent wallet. I️ deposited in BTC a lot.
I just started buying games this way. I only got one.
Maybe we should have accepted the move to Segwit2x? That would have probably helped?

This is SteamDB, not Steam. Still, it's sad.
People who believe in the technology will carry on carrying on. Doesn't have to be btc, personally I prefer the team behind Litecoin but that's just my opinion in this speculative world of crypto.
Want to talk about a scary market that could be taking place if retailers start rejecting BTC. 
Guess peer to peer remains btc’s focus.
interesting
the main problem with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin is that aren't enough marketmakers to stabilize the price for transactions to complete. Add to that there aren't derivative devices like options to narrow the bid/ask price & lower transactional costs.
I didn't know it was an option to begin with.
Ruh roh raggy
Where can I get a short position?? 
SHORT SHORT SHORT
Shit. I just bought a game for BTC two days ago. 
Short Bitcoin
I think Bitcoin will become more of a storage of money at this point. Some other coin will become the spending of said money. I kind of thought that's how Litecoin would work out, or maybe DASH. Who knows, it all feels very wrong and not like how Bitcoin was supposed to be
Unless bitcoin drops off the #1 spot it's going potentially delay crypto adoption by years. Bitcoin Cash will never be the solution, it'll always cause confusion by living in the shadow of the original bitcoin.

I presume most people here knew about this already.

The TL;DR is the IRS considers BTC property and is taxed as such. 

Due to its soaring price merchants are ditching it because of the potential tax burden."
Sounds like Bitcoin Core is finally losing Steam.
Waiting for the BTC bubble to burst is like waiting for the new season of Thrones. It's been a long wait, but it's gonna be one hell of a ride once it starts up.
This news basically shook my last bit of hope for btc. Just bought a ton of Bitcoin Cash and bought some precious metals with the rest of it
"> As of today, Steam will no longer support Bitcoin as a payment method on our platform due to high fees and volatility in the value of Bitcoin.
> 
> In the past few months we've seen an increase in the volatility in the value of Bitcoin and a significant increase in the fees to process transactions on the Bitcoin network. For example, transaction fees that are charged to the customer by the Bitcoin network have skyrocketed this year, topping out at close to $20 a transaction last week (compared to roughly $0.20 when we initially enabled Bitcoin). Unfortunately, Valve has no control over the amount of the fee. These fees result in unreasonably high costs for purchasing games when paying with Bitcoin. The high transaction fees cause even greater problems when the value of Bitcoin itself drops dramatically.
> 
> Historically, the value of Bitcoin has been volatile, but the degree of volatility has become extreme in the last few months, losing as much as 25% in value over a period of days. This creates a problem for customers trying to purchase games with Bitcoin. When checking out on Steam, a customer will transfer x amount of Bitcoin for the cost of the game, plus y amount of Bitcoin to cover the transaction fee charged by the Bitcoin network. The value of Bitcoin is only guaranteed for a certain period of time so if the transaction doesn’t complete within that window of time, then the amount of Bitcoin needed to cover the transaction can change. The amount it can change has been increasing recently to a point where it can be significantly different.
>
> The normal resolution for this is to either refund the original payment to the user, or ask the user to transfer additional funds to cover the remaining balance. In both these cases, the user is hit with the Bitcoin network transaction fee again. This year, we’ve seen increasing number of customers get into this state. With the transaction fee being so high right now, it is not feasible to refund or ask the customer to transfer the missing balance (which itself runs the risk of underpayment again, depending on how much the value of Bitcoin changes while the Bitcoin network processes the additional transfer).
> 
> At this point, it has become untenable to support Bitcoin as a payment option. We may re-evaluate whether Bitcoin makes sense for us and for the Steam community at a later date.
> 
> We will continue working to resolve any pending issues for customers who are impacted by existing underpayments or transaction fees.

"Ask them on Steam to support Bitcoin Cash instead since it has low TX fees:

"Honestly they are right

Even Satoshi said the system was about low fees

But what happened is the number for fees remained the same as the price increased whereas the mining fee should’ve decreased.

I guess they may adopt Bitcoin Cash? Living the real concept"
I wonder how many other merchant will look at things like this and be less likely to look into crypto as a means of payment as a result.
"> Less than two years after adopting Bitcoin as a payment option on Steam, Valve has announced that it is dropping support for the virtual currency. The decision to eliminate the option comes as a result of both the extremely high transaction fees charged by Bitcoin, and recent, also-extremely-high levels of instability in its value.

emphasis on:

>The decision to eliminate the option comes as a result of both the **extremely high transaction fees** charged by Bitcoin, and recent, **also-extremely-high levels of instability in its value**.""

See what you've done, Blockstream Core?"
Can't blame them, currencies are supposed to be stable and bitcoin is currently anything but stable. 
I mean...I wouldn’t take it as currency either. It’s too volatile. If the price goes down tomorrow then it loses half its value or whatever. It will go down, just how much is the question. 
Funny- literally just saw news of this elsewhere.  Had a feeling this would be on r/btc ... came right over here to check my premonition..... TOP NEWS?!?! Sad.  Bitcoin-hate is the top news in a BCH-driven subreddit?  SMH

Fix the transaction fee problem and the hemorrhaging will stop.
"Tax plan passed which increased the debt by a trillion and in turn weakens the dollar.

BTC has more value than a USD as demonstrated by the upwards surge. Its scarce because theres a finite amount where our shit US govt keeps printing money. When you have more and more of something the value spreads out accordingly.

If enough people places value on something ...it can be traded. It has value.

This is stupid. Bitcoin is a currency. You wouldn't change the amount of £ the game costs because the USD conversion rate changes from day to day. They should just charge an exact number of satoshi, and hold until they can cash out to their preferred currency at a profit. "
"Haha - fools. They are stopping for different reasons. 

I just transferred Bcash today and it takes for fucking ever!

Steam is not using bitcoin any longer, because it's too volatile for their business.

"Can someone tell me what is the point of using cryptocurrency on Steam? No one gives a fuck what games you'll play. The currency should be used on stuff you dont want the government to know. Paying for normal shit like games or coffee is just...stupid. The irony here is that cryptocurrency showed us that real currency is better for normal use. Cryptocurrency is only used by investors, and they dont do anything with it but sit on it.

Btw, I love text on the right.

""There is no government, company, or bank in charge of Bitcoin. As such, it is more resistant to **wild inflation** and corrupt banks.""

Yeah, but not to wild deflation, which is just as damaging. Who would wanna put any serious money into a system with such fluctuation? And look at whats happening now. Sure, no corrupt banks, instead the value is decided not by anything real, like changes on the market, but instead by investors wanting to make a quick buck."
Further proof that bitcoin is more of a scam/pyramid scheme/false construct than an actual valuable entity.  Its use should be banned everywhere.  
Use Litecoin
"I guess they realized anybody can make a shitcoin  
And worst of all: people will adopt it"
Converting BTC to LTC
Its sad that both sides are freaking out right now... The btc trolls and bch trolls cant control themselves over tiny changes... How about waiting and seeing what will happen since NOBODY KNOWS..
Probably smart since it's fake money
who cares ?!
Steam has had their throats cut by the world Government
The divide is amazing because many are upset that it is not being adopted and others are upset that people are not HODLing. I wonder why Steam is no longer accepting it though. Perhaps the fees and wait times are an issue. 
What’s the conversion rate of BTC to Schrute Bucks? 
every time a service stops accepting btc, price rises because there's less sellers.

This post has also a huge amount of upvotes on r/bitcoin.
You're all fanatics, you're all also fucking pathetic. Why can't you have both? Shit, Valve might event adopt a different cryptocurrency, this is not politics. 
Thread was hijacked by a bunch of morons who don't understand cryptocurrency. Muh tulips, muh.bubble, muh Bitcoin is dead,  same rhetoric for years. Wake up you fucking zombies. Time to make peace that the old system you worship in fiate is nonsense. Your dollars are losing value and most people who own are not going to give them up especially at these low prices. Omg he said bitcoins price is low?!?!!?? Reeeeeeee
How can you mine BCH?
They don't like how unstable the currency is. 
I’m not advocating one or way or another I’m just asking how deflationary currency would be handled. 
Steam should support btc!
What bubble ?? - I wish I have bought more bitcoin if it wasn't for the dam bank and the exchange dragging their foot and put a hold on my money.  I would have bought more bitcoins and gained equity on my investment...instead, my usd money is seating on the exchange (finally) and the Bitcoin price is at $14,300, which is more than $2,300 higher than 24 hours ago...
Looking forward to the BTC dip. Then we can already play fallout 5 on our pc's, while paying in BTCs
"So let me get this straight: (purely looking for education)

1. How does adoption of accepting a crypto help the asset BCH grow?"
The major reason is because bitcoin price is far from stable, and can change thousands in 1 single day.
SODL - what you would call the equivalent of HODL in selling mode? 
We still accept bitcoin at www.Negash83.com
No Bitcoin no game
Good, they were overcharging. 
you can't walk into Walmart and pay with a bar of Gold. Same logic.
Traitors! Long live Core! /s
ENJINCOIN the crypto for gaming.
why is blocksize a public debate? Bitcoin can add 2nd layers. Is bitcoin like a Swiss bank account for moving large sums of money or for micro transactions like buying coffee? What about rootstock, side chains, atomic swaps? 
Get the fuck out of Bitcoin while you still have any money at all.
LOL! So this is reddit bitcoin and you guys actually hate bitcoin? You should open a tulip subreddit and talk about tulips all day.
Should they use BCash instead?
Well, they never accepted gold, so I guess that makes it pretty clear which direction BTC is headed. 
But my currency of the future!??!?!?
Steam is rightfully worried, exchange risk is a major problem. Wonder what exchange CME will settle bitcoin futures through.. 
makes sense since BTC is no longer made for payments
So, It might be true that the central planners will short Bitcoin. I don't care. I luv Monero!
"I'm not surprised.

If Bitcoin transaction fees don't come down to 2% - 3% to compete with major payment processing services then it will never see mass market adoption for payment processing.  The last Bitcoin payment I sent today had TX fees over 10%, 4x higher than my other payment processing services - it's fucking ridiculous and I'm losing interest in using it for business.

Bitcoin developers and miners had better start figuring out how to compete with mainstream payment processors."
Who would have thought that a wildly unstable and unpredictable currency doesn’t inspire confidence in vendors?
the way BTC is you don't want to be in the middle either, because the exchanged will hold you up at gun point. they make their money of trades not the currency itself, if it pops a a big number, they just don't have enough to pay people out.
"Well the price is still increasing. And there still seem to be people that want to buy bitcoin.

However if bitcoin keeps losing acceptance as a currency (which is likely as few people will want to pay with something that rapidly increases in value) then it's really just a matter of time before everything collapses."
Everyone is waiting for the burst...
*you have been banned from /r/bitcoin*

No idea what any of that meant.
/u/tippr gild the truth
You'd still need 10TB blocks to have 3 billion people use the block chain each making 1-2 transactions a day for 0 fees and that doesn't include all the junk and spam and business transactions, you need layer 2 solutions. At even 1gb blocks youd have like only data center nodes, easily coopted by the government, it's about censorship resistant money on the base layer.
Nobody seems to care about the environmental issues of mining cryptocurrency.... 
I mean, I agree that 1MB is too small, but it's ludicrous to claim that 1GB blocks are feasible. How many people can download and validate 144GB a day?
Meh, or you change the network topology like DASH did. Let's not pretend gigabyte blocks are a real solution, there's a lot of hand-waving involved like assuming SSD sizes and network speeds going up indefinitely. And of course, massive block-size increases lead to centralization.
Yikes .09 now. Hahahahahahaha
My close friend has a vpn business. Unyil several months ago they had about 5% of their sales paid in bitcoins. For the last 3 weeks, zero bitcoin payments. Ita just not useful as a currency anymore. Unless a solution is found bitcoin will never become a payment system.
">Why in the world would you waste something that is going up in value as a payment method if you have other forms of payment.

And this is going to be the death or at least severe wounding of bitcoin. 

If the price is going up why spend it and if the price is going down why accept it as payment"
"If you are buying with $ that you could be using to buy bitcoin it's the same exact thing.

Pay $10 for game is the same as pay $10 for btc then pay btc for game. "
Ironic
"When spelled out like that it seems that there's little utility to cryptocurrencies as a whole.

In the beginning there's was this idea that it would be big for international transfers and would dethrone Paypal at least, but the dreamers were aiming for Visa levels. That hasn't happened at all. On Ebay, Etsy, Ali, etc there are almost no merchants taking cryptos. The shops taking cryptos are limited to bitcoin, the others haven't seen almost any adopton.

On paper cryptos sound so nice. What's the problem? Are they hard to use? Hard to understand? The volatility of the exchange rate? Politics?"

Today's [**blitzkrieg for BCH merchant adoption** is (sensibly) targeted at Steam](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7i0ml8/bitcoin_cash_merchant_adoption_blitzkrieg_day_3_6/). It's something constructive that you can do which takes but a minute.
That has never been a factor in using bitcoin on steam. People still used it.
This is the internet. Nobody knows econ 101 here.
"Well no shit. Some of these people literally became millionaires simply because they ran their computer over night mining Bitcoins after they heard about it on 4chan, using electricity that mummy and daddy paid for.

Of COURSE they want it to be used as a store of value because that guarantees scarceness which makes them rich.

Hell, if I held a bunch of Bitcoin I wouldn't want it to become a proper currency either! Real currencies need to remain stable and not jump up 25% one day and drop 15% the next. 

What pisses me off is I bought my first BTC and ETH in January this year. I heard about BTC for years and always regretted not getting in earlier and finally decided this year I'd dip my toes in and learn about it properly.

Later on I made a larger investment when all the alts were exploding and the $14 AUD ETH I bought was now worth $250 AUD.

I traded all my BTC for alts that sounded promising after learning about BTC's scaling issues and where has that gotten me? Stratis tanked and finally recovering slowly, Eth has gone up a bit, BAT has gone sideways... I'm probably 1.5X's more initial investment. Nothing to cry about but I would have made more investing that back into my business.

Meanwhile, if I left my entire investment in a shitcoin with no scaling, no use cases, a divided community I would have made like 5X profit. Now I'm looking to buy in again so I can diversify even more but there's no fucking way I'm gonna FOMO again and watch the prices tank 60% 24 hours later."
Time to sell the beanie baby collection.....
"Their level of cognitive dissonance is mind blowing, I can't even believe it's happening at all.  And I still hold BTC but I know it's shit, I'm only staying in because I don't need it... and maybe these crazies will continue to drive the 'gold price' up.

All I want is a usable crypto again that's widely accepted, scaled, and stable like BCH so I can go back to things like paying for steam games/VPN/donations/etc with it.

I feel like I'm taking crazy pills for wanting that after reading r/bitcoin these days."
Honestly, I am so excited for when the whole thing crashes one day.
You are stuck on v1 of crypto. Ride the wave but remember to get onboard with v3 cough Iota cough
"An ""on-chain"" transaction is just a normal transaction, it uses the block chain for validation.  This is what people mean by ""transaction"" 99% of the time.

An ""off-chain"" transaction is something that bypasses the block chain and uses some other way to validate the transaction.  Example would be the Lightning Network that Bitcoin Core is working on.

Block size refers to how much data can be included in a single ""block"" on the block chain.  Bitcoin has a 1MB hard-coded limit in the block size, which means there is a limit to how many transactions can be processed, and that doesn't scale well.  This is a problem today as evidenced by high transaction fees and slow confirmation times with Bitcoin.  

Bitcoin Cash's solution was to increase this block size.  Bitcoin's solution is to do some things separately from the block chain (""off-chain"").  One (of many) problems with this is that the technology doesn't exist to do this yet, so for now Bitcoin Cash works and Bitcoin doesn't - that's why Steam dropped support for Bitcoin."

"everyone accepts it in exchange for any other digital currency.... like gold to fiat.

You can even trade it for BCASH on every single exchange that lists BCASH if you're gullible enough to get scammed."
At $10,000 or $12,000 a unit, even getting out now will get you a tidy profit. Unless... you were the sucker who bought it at those prices. 
"I'm not sure if they have came out and said it but Namecheap is basically unusable now for the same reasons as Steam. I want to buy a $0.49 domain but I'm not spending $10+ in TX fees to do that. That's even worse than a gift card if you're trying to stay anonymous.

Same with using a cloud server and paying them in BTC, like Vultr. I expect they will eventually offer something else or turn off Bitcoin as well.

All of these are symptoms of the same root problem which is the inability to provide utility in the $5 - $10 range."
"That's not such a problem it's just an issue of people have problems with decimal places.

The other point is entirely true though."
What you need to look at is the market cap. Which is still stupid big.
Depends on the user base. The EUR certainly is. The whole argument is fundamentally flawed by comparing national currencies or GDP's with something trans-national.
Confusing total currency in circulation with face value... but still not a currency.

No. 
BCH is meant to be a currency.
Maybe
He means that there wasn't an actual reason behind it, other than people putting money into it. People putting money into it isn't an economic reason. When people put money into a currency, it doesn't spike and start doubling in value. Bubbles and values based on speculation and no actual backing behind it does that, making it not a real currency or form of payment, and making it even more volatile.. that when you have invested in it, and get the news that there's a drop, you may not even make it to a computer before what you have is worth zero.
That's because it hasn't popped yet. It will, because people are speculating, not using it for transactions. 
Why do people get so offended by the idea of BTC being a bubble? There's no real room for debate at this point, you have people pouring money into it with no clue what it actually is, because they think it's some sort of money printing scheme. There's plenty of money to be made in a bubble if you're smart.

 Some people think it's around the corner, some people think they'll see $100k by the end of 2018, some might even think it'll never stop in their lifetime. So they dine exclusively on good news and make plans for how they're gonna spend their fortune.

"> Is there a simple guide that explains how bitcoin has actual worth?

[speculation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/speculation.asp)"
A good point, well made!
"People are speculating that the block chain is a revolutionary concept and disruptive technology. Saying it's just a speculative bubble is like saying cell phones and internet is just a fad
 Crypto is here to stay and things are just starting to heat up. Couple that with a GLOBAL market and you're going to see a specialist bubble like you've never seen. Cheers!"
What it is: market that can be manipulated by biggies (Kim dot com) without any pesky regulatory agencies crying foul. 
"Did you read their statement?

>they sell something and get 50$ in bitcoins. Bitcoins getting more expensive only gives them more money, 60$ for example

That assumes the price is only ever going up. If it is a bubble, and the bubble pops, they may lose all the gains. Generally, businesses don't like added risk. It's why they buy insurance. They'd prefer less volatility, even if they get a little bit less for it.

And the quickly moving price makes it a pain in the ass to deal with when it comes to slow transaction times and high transaction fees. You buy a game, but the transaction takes a long time, and the price drops 8% in that time. Now what? Pay another transaction fee and send the rest? Cancel the sale and have them send the money back to you? Who pays that transaction cost? Pay the rest with a credit card? That defeats the purpose in the first place
"
They probably liquidate it into cash ASAP. Companies would rather invest in themselves than an external asset.
"> Bitcoins getting more expensive only gives them more money, 60$ for example

yeah, and then tomorrow bitcoin loses 80+% of it's value, like it has before, and suddenly that $50 in coins is worth $10"
"There is no guarantee of that. Bitcoin can all go up in smoke in a second. You don't truly believe something only rapidly moves in one direction do you?

It's too volatile to be used as currency. And if you're a large business, that means you can lose a lot of money too if you rake in a bunch of bitcoin. 

But the likely reason is the government taking issue with it and Valve just doesn't want to deal with this. 

There is no upside. If they wanted to make money from bitcoin jumping in value it makes more sense to just convert the regular cash payments to bitcoin if that's something they wanted to do. "
It absolutely can be traced that is a huge common misconception. The whole point of bitcoin is there is an immutable record of every transaction and each coin is cryptographically unique.

BTC is really going to hit unconfirmed tx ATH soon. I don't know if the general public will understand anything about it. They just probably buy off of Coinbase and leave it there.

I sold right after I found out this news. This is the writing on the wall for Bitcoin. Selling at $12k and watching it go up to $19k in 12 hours was disheartening, but after thinking it over, I'm glad I did. I believe the next few months to be very interesting for the price.

I don't think you understand taxes.   If I held 20k in bitcoin and it goes up to 30k before i liquidate,  i pay .. let's say $3k in taxes on that $10k gain.   My total net benefit is the $20k payment +$7k gain net of taxes = $27k.  If someone had paid in USD, i would only have the $20k payment.

If BTC is raising in price pretty quick then wouldn't it be kind of silly to spend it on something like a game? Of course it does need to be spent to become a currency but what reason is there to spend it?

I disagree. There might be a few different coins for different niche markets, but I still think there will be one or two main ones for general-purpose purchases.

how do you solve for deflation if there is a fixed amount? the inherent problem with finite supply is you inevitably end up with whale hoarders who essentially become a sudo mafia and can control the market..which i think is the case with BTC at this point.

"If you think it's only good for buying things then it's no better than Paypal.

Keeping your money safe from governments seems a much better use than buying games - which you can do with cash or a credit card already."
Wasn't the point of cryptocurrencies to get *rid* of middlemen and extra steps?  Payment processors have been known to screw people over and censor/freeze funds of people they don't agree with.  Just look at what paypal did to VPN providers.  Cryptocurrency was supposed to be an end to this and a direct transfer of value to pay people for services and whatnot.  It's literally the bitcoin whitepaper title.
I stand corrected!
But isn’t that the same with any currency? You would hold it only if you think its value will not diminish. BTC is not unique in that regard. The one advantage non-crypto currency has is that you can easily buy milk and things you need everyday with it. The advantage BC has is that a big government or a bank can’t easily manipulate it. The crypto-currency will certainly continue to evolve and will probably get wider adoption. (I wouldn’t be surprised if ApplePay was already working on it.j

That is what Satoshi claimed but it doesn't necessarily mean those were the true intentions. The way I see it, if it was really a threat to the central banking system, they would have regulated it in several ways by now. The fact that nothing was done to manage this ""threat"" tells me it was a part of the plan.

>That's like an Illuminati level conspiracy theory with people thinking decades ahead

Yes that is what I'm alleging, if we define the ""Illuminati"" as being the central banking cartel that all govts in the world are indebted to.

I think there was a plan to introduce a cashless economy for a while now and Bitcoin was a part of the psyop to get people onboard with the idea. When the next economic crash inevitably comes and makes us even more miserable than we are now, people will beg the govt for a fix and crypto will be right there, likely doing very well during this crash.

Now, you buy coffee every day to the tune of $50 a week + some online shopping for another $50.  Load $100 to BTC and spend as you go.  When your spend wallet gets low, you top up with another $100.  In this way, your coffee isn't $5 its really $3 because your coin appreciates.

Because really, lets look at the logic of never spending any of your BTC.  You buy $100 worth of coffee every month.  You could have not bought coffee and bought $100 more in BTC.  Oh, wait, movies? dinner? dress for the wife? toy for the kid?  No, don't buy anything, put it all in BTC.  Saying that you can't spend any BTC, even for transactions makes as much sense as that logic.

But, you can only do that if BTC transfers for pennies.  Now, you top up with BCH or ETH.  Oh, wait, kitties are here, BCH only."

Kraken and Bitstamp both support BCH. Coinbase is expected to add BCH support by January 1, 2018. Those are the three biggest exchanges AFAIK.
"""Cryptocurrencies are not supposed be used as a currency"""
"The Bitcoin (BTC) network can handle about 3 people making a transaction each second.

Each transaction pays a (small) fee to whichever miner adds it to the ledger called the blockchain.

When there are more transactions than a miner can fit into the block that he is adding to the ledger (which in BTC has a maximum size), he chooses the transactions that make him the most money.

Because there are consistently more than 3 people per second wanting to make a transaction with BTC, they all are bidding up the fee that makes they're transaction more desirable to a miner.

So all of this means that the small fee from before is now a fairly sizable fee. While Steam isn't directly paying that fee, any time they process a refund they have to pay that fee, and they've been running into issues where they've had to do more refunds than average on specifically BTC purchases - customers would send Steam BTC but would get outbid on their fee and thus their transaction would get ""stuck"". Because Steam hasn't received money yet they don't consider the sale complete and don't give the customer the game they want, so the customer asks for a refund.

All of this costs Steam more money and hassle (which is money because you have to train employees in how to handle it) than it gains them, so they've stopped accepting BTC."
It's much smaller than the impact of all the efforts to keep the petrodollar afloat.

Due to this change in direction, Bitcoin is no longer suitable for use as a currency, which is why Steam just dropped it.

I think the misunderstanding here is that people buying bitcoin are actually looking at it as a currency. IMO to probably 90% of people, if not more, bitcoin is an investment not a currency. To some bitcoin is currency and they think they everyone should use it and USD is satan. However I think that the true value of bitcoin is more like gold. No one actually uses gold as a currency anymore, however it is seen as like the fallback currency or an investment which is why it is worth so much. I don't know if it will continue to grow until it catches up to gold or if it will fall but no one really does. In reality most people putting money into bitcoin are doing so expecting that it will continue to grow and so long as more and more people start to think that it is a good investment the more it will grow. It does have some inherent value as a currency sure, as it is kind of like online cash that can't really be traced outside of the two people who exchanged the money which is great for things like drugs, however we're well past that point.
And the fact that hackers can just take your bitcoin. There’s no backup. The community can’t/won’t save you if you are hacked. It’s too risky. There is a bubble and it will burst as more larger holders get hacked. The hackers are idiots bc they don’t realize that the more hacking of bitcoin becomes rampant the less value it holds and soon it’s just useless math. 
"People want to pay with a current like that. It's business that don't want to take a currency that's rapidly growing in worth. 

Edit: I think I just have a different mind about investing. Probably because I don't do it hardly ever and I haven't yet with btc. The amount it is at right now would definitely have me cleaning out some but obviously not all of it. "
"> Also, do you want the metaphoric bubble to burst? 

First of all, metaphoric? What?  
  
Second of all, yes, yes you do want it to burst. If the currency is legitimate, it will fall to reasonable trading levels. There is a reason we don't use commodities with essentially fixed supplies as currency, which is what you have now with btc. The value in btc comes from it being used, not from holding onto it. The bubble bursting would be the best thing to happen to btc at this point."

*When* it fails, cryptocurrency will reset like the video game industry.  The next biggest player will invest in a regulatory process to ensure the currency is difficult to use for illicit transactions and money laundering, and when that happens, cryptos will start growing again, but only slower.

"> (camp1) One wanting Bitcoin to scale on-chain

Let's take a note of something.  This was always the plan for Bitcoin.  [The project's creator was quite clear about that](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1347.msg15366#msg15366) and until 2011 or so nobody would have questioned that it would be removed long before it was an economic factor.  [The change was foisted on us.](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3h9cq4/its_time_for_a_break_about_the_recent_mess/)

Now understand, one of the main reasons someone holds a crypto - any consensus (blockchain) crypto -  is the idea that ""nobody controls your currency, nobody can inflate or arbitrarily change the economics of the system without your consent.""  ""Even the devs?"" you might ask.  ""no not even the devs, if they do something you don't like, we can always fork.""

Well, the economics of the system **were** changed without our consent (this is what a soft fork does), so we hard-forked to BCH.

BTC might or might not grow up to be something one day.  Who knows.  But the system appears unusable now and in the foreseeable future.  The point is quite simple: BCH (the original plan) is still *just the better plan.*

Now maybe us libertarians are the minority now and the rest of the noobs jumping into Bitcoin BTC to get rich quick don't care about privacy or AML or ever spending them on anything but US Dollars but I think that the original idea of making onchain Bitcoin into a global currency or bringing financial sovereignty to 3 billion unbanked was pretty hip and *way* more disruptive than anything proposed from the BTC camp, which seems much more like ""banking enablement technology"" to me.

BCH is BTC with the training wheels taken off.  I'm really excited to see what it's about to do.  There are no barriers to entry, unlike with BTC, or competing objectives, unlike with ETH.  It's like a Petri dish with $22B of agar in it."

What other companies have disappeared from Bitcoin?
Well considering crypto is designed in part to take power away from the state and central banks that seems like a stretch. That's like an Illuminati level conspiracy theory with people thinking decades ahead. It is however reasonable to believe that governments might eventually concede to the idea of a digital blockchain currency but force their way into the system so that they can still control the monetary supply. Obviously the biggest hurdle would be that this would likely mean that the same government that decided big banks were too big to fail a decade ago will now think that big banks are completely unnecessary. I remain skeptical of how it'll get done but my cynicism tells me that we'll end up with the convenience of Bitcoin minus the convenience of physical cash and minus the economic benefits of crypto
