"Although there are technical nitpicks about SegWit itself, that's not what split the community. It's three things about SegWit that caused all this...

 1. Core prioritized SegWit before a ""base"" blocksize increase. This was done knowing that the blocks would become full, and fees would rise as is happening now. It was judged to be worth it to battle centralization, force adoption of off chain technology, and purposely create a fee market. The other side (mostly) was not against segregating witness data or adopting second layers, they just wanted Bitcoin to operate like normal until those things came along naturally. They were either ok with, or disagreed with, the arguments about centralization risk and fee markets.

 2. SegWit was done as a soft fork and only had around 30-something% of signalled support at its peak (without 2X). A soft fork is a way to change the Bitcoin protocol in a way that old nodes won't be able to tell that anything is different and won't reject the changes. In software, whether or not something is backwards compatible is often pretty random and often not related to the complexity or scope of change. SegWit is an example of that. SegWit is a drastic change to the code and economics of Bitcoin, and many people felt a soft fork was a way to trick nodes into accepting controversial changes and that it would create unnecessary technical debt and problems during adoption compared to a hard fork.

 3. Many people saw SegWit as a stepping stone towards goals they disagreed with, such as artificially creating a fee market, turning on chain into a settlement layer, and making Bitcoin's primary use into a digital gold rather than peer to peer cash.

"
"If you are willing to do a hard fork, you can get all the benefits of Segwit (bigger blocks & malleability fixes) with just a few tiny, low-risk changes. Since the Bitcoin Cash chain is happy to do hard forks, this is the way forward.

Segwit gets these same two benefits, but in a horribly convoluted way that requires all software to be re-written. This complexity is completely pointless, *unless* your goal is to avoid a hard fork at all costs. That's why the segwit2x concept was completely retarded. If you are willing to hard-fork to 2x, you don't need segwit in the first place."

Lack?  There are more segwit txs than all of Bitcoin Cash.  If there's a ""lack"" of segwit usage, what do you call Bitcoin Cash's usage then?  Lol...

> This is how the maxblocksize came into being. It was a hard-coded variable that was not part of the protocol

I actually agree.  The 1mb blocksize wasn't initially a consensus rule.  I believe it was originally limited to 32mb.  It was softforked down to 1mb to fight spam attacks.  There were likely better solutions to this.  Had he initially made it 2mb, we may have never had a community split..  But this is the situation we're in now, like it or not."

That's correct.  Soft forks would be very messy without at least a simple majority.

> I still think it is basically semantics. Segwit changed the rules. So did Cash.

I don't think it's semantics.  There is a definable, nuanced difference.  Yes, they both changed the rules, but segwit doesn't break any existing rules.  Bitcoin Cash breaks 2 existing rules (blocksize and difficulty adjustment algorithm).

> They are both just as valid Bitcoin chains

I disagree.  Breaking rules makes it a new altcoin entirely.  For instance, based on your logic, a future hard fork can break the 21 million coin supply limit (something very fundamental to what Bitcoin is), and you would still define that as ""Bitcoin"".  I would not."
"> Actually, it changed everything and was widely reported in the industry press and social networks. It locked-in Segwit irrevocably.

My point is that ""lock-in"" doesn't change or upgrade anything.  Yes, I agree it was an emotional day.  I was very excited, but anything could have happened between lock-in and activation.  It was by no means a guarantee.  The segwit rules weren't activated on lock-in day.

> Well if that's the case then increasing the block size and changing the DA also did not break the consensus rules either because they were just upgrades and still compatible with the main chain.

What?  Yes they did break rules.  The consensus rule said that blocks must be less than 1mb.  Bitcoin Cash explicitly *broke* that rule.  Any bitcoin miner or node running at that time would *reject* all Bitcoin Cash blocks.  They are entirely incompatible with the network.  Are you aware of how consensus networks work?

> Already did with v0.3.20

I believe there was an inadvertent bug in 2013 that split the chain and forced a community decision.  The resulting chain was likely be incompatible with the original client.

Each node can charge as many satoshis as they want to relay a hop (default to 10 satoshis).  When you make a payment, your client will find the cheapest route, with the fewest hops and fewest aggregate fee.

They don't seem to be that far off actually, slightly above 10% of the core branch total. That's underwhelming for segwit especially after the whole USAF NO2X circus. The cash branch network will take time to recapture the adoption the core branch is ostracizing because people follow leadership and trust other people. They had to follow the branch they perceive to have the most support (a self reinforcing state). 

> agreeing 

So you see how calling an alt to the cash branch because it ""hard forked"" is unjustified since hard forks can be shoved unto users via soft forks enforcing non-protocol stuff.

"Yes a future fork could do anything. But if it doesn't make sense, then not enough of the ecosystem will support it to keep it alive.

"What if a future soft fork removed the block reward entirely, would you still call that Bitcoin? 

What if a future softfork made the block size 0 bytes and created a new, extension block which could be up to 1GB in size? Would you still call that Bitcoin?

My point is that we should not be judging changes to rules based on if they are 'soft' or 'hard' forks, but instead based on what they change. They type of fork (soft or hard) is just a deployment technicality."
"> Breaking rules makes it a new altcoin entirely.

Hard-forks make for cleaner upgrades. Soft-forks allow a minority to push unpopular changes.

A soft-fork can increase the 21million coin limited by introducing ""segregated coins"" that get up to 8MB of block-space. Sure you can stick with the old limit: but you also have to make-do with 1MB blocs.

">Are you aware of how consensus networks work?

Yep, unlike many of the r/bitcoiners, network consensus is based on mining hash power consensus and not on what non-mining nodes or developers want.  This is why Bitcoin Cash was created in the first place, to take away control from the Core developers and place it back in the hands of miners who have the most skin in the game and wanted to continue with the original vision of Bitcoin.

>Version 0.3 was not from 2017. It was likely from 2011 or 2010. It's not compatible with anything.

Me neither! I am looking forward to all sorts of second layers once adoption is huge and people can't flee the Bitcoin network without exposing themselves to the volatility of the smaller alts.

I also don't think it is realistic to expect Bitcoin to become resilient to future governmental attack and to become a non-volatile asset by wrecking the hard work so many people like me had at getting real adoption (outside of exchange speculation). 

I also don't expect the mining costs to be competitive with so few transactions.

"Fair enough. I disagree with the limitations you state, especially that Rasperry Pi's should be able to process *every* payment on this planet (there is simply no need), and also the ""instant"" part, as Bitcoin Cash enables 0-confirmation payments, but we have both models now.

There are a couple issues I still have with your position:

a) Don't you agree that the Lightning UX is very problematic in many ways? On chain transactions are easier by far, much more robust, much easier to implement for businesses and are much easier to onboard new users. See this [comment](https://np.reddit.com/r/OpenBazaar/comments/7q65y3/will_ob_implement_lighting_network_features/dstii7r/) for a more elaborate breakdown.

b) You state you want to keep the network decentralized. Yet lightning [can't be decentralized by nature](https://medium.com/@jonaldfyookball/mathematical-proof-that-the-lightning-network-cannot-be-a-decentralized-bitcoin-scaling-solution-1b8147650800).

c) Do you support censoring dissenting opinions? Why do you spent so much time supporting these censored forums? Don't you agree that the community should be allowed to discuss issues openly without moderator intervention?

d) Why do you use terms like ""bcash""? They are very clearly [negatively connotated](https://medium.com/@jonaldfyookball/why-some-people-call-bitcoin-cash-bcash-this-will-be-shocking-to-new-readers-956558da12fb) and you still use the term. It weakens your argument."

All I can say is that there will always be changes as the coins develop in what is a changing environment. The intention was to vote upon important changes with the proviso that the coin remained backwards compatible. If it wasn't, then a hard fork is called for and a brand new coin.

"> This is not what Core proposes with Lightning, in which case Bitcoin is being reduced to become a settlement layer. 

Satoshi was a genius, but even geniuses can't predict the future.

I don't believe it's realistic to put every coffee purchase and every micro transaction on the blockchain, to be stored forever, by thousands of node operators.  I believe that we must keep the base layer as decentralized as possible, so that anyone can run a node on a raspberry pi without much effort.

But we can easily add the cash layer on top of this decentralized, protected base layer.  With Lightning, there is no ""transactions per second"" limit at all, and all transactions are secured *instantly*.  No waiting for 10 or 20 minutes for a block.  This is *much better* than what transactions on the blockchain can do.  Even with GB sized blocks, there is still a ""transactions per second"" limit that will eventually be hit.  So raising the blocksize isn't a solution.  It only addresses the symptoms, not the problem.

If we make the base layer more centralized with larger blocks, where only giant corporations can afford to run nodes, we can never get that decentralized property back on a second layer.

So, as a developer, my opinion is to protect the base layer, and keep it as decentralized as possible, with as many nodes as possible.  Then we scale with 2nd layer payment solutions like Lightning.

I believe this is the best way forward, so I'll continue to support that model."

Utter bullshit. The lack of segwit usage proves there were no **U**sers. It was all a few loud mouths, some of them who don't use crypto and are just speculators (like Tone Vays and a few of his talk partners who can't even generate an address on the fly) and lots of hats.

The only reason they pushed the voting over the ACTIVATION THRESHOLD was because they didn't want to split the community (the same with the majority which was afraid and the same reason so many went with segwit even calling it ""bitcoin"" at first) and were promised 2MB later. 

Also realize this: you can have a lot of things ossifying in the protocol via softfork before you start throwing ""alt"" around. You can have a reduction of blocksize being implemented as a softfork, old clients accept the smaller size. Once you have enough clients using the smaller size, you can force the old clients to have to hard fork if they want blocks bigger than the pre reduction. Would the old clients be following an alt then? No! Because the bloody limit was not part of the protocol! 

This is how the maxblocksize came into being. It was a hard-coded variable that was not part of the protocol, introduced as minor and temporary thing trivially increasable later on (and not part of the old client). 

"
If Satoshi used the original signature hash method, then it is Bitcoin Segwit, because they didn't upgrade the signature hash algorithm with a hard fork. They also have to process signatures that have quadratic scaling issues for number of inputs and consider them valid. Bitcoin Cash no longer considers those valid. 
Yes, I suppose so. Also, hard forks (not backwards compatible) are required to update the protocol. BTC has had several already and will either die or have more in the future. 
"Good explanation thank you. I didn't realize they looked like ""anyone can spend"" transactions to old software. This requires most nodes to upgrade in to be secure. Otherwise they would functionally be anyone can spend.

That is true, Bitcoin Cash blinked first. However, who forked off first really doesn't matter in the slightest, there would still be Bitcoin SegWit and Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin Cash had to act first because it was the only way and last chance to preserve a pre-SegWit branch. 

Politically, Bitcoin Cash was a reaction to Blockstream's hostile takeover of the original Bitcoin Core code repository and largest Bitcoin communities at the time, and gross mismanagement for the past 4 years. Without Blockstream and SegWit's activation, there may have been no need for Bitcoin Cash if the original roadmap was followed by Bitcoin Core developers. They did not. In this, SegWit *did cause a hardfork* as a political and ideological reaction to Blockstream's vision that is entirely contrary to what Bitcoin was founded on.

The introduction of SegWit instead of a block size increase triggered the creation of BCH. That's a simple fact. There were other causes, but that event (or rather, that event being locked in, not the actual date of activation) was the trigger."

"/r/bitcoin are authoritarians who can't think for themselves and prefer to have Core do it for them. They think that Bitcoin can't work they way it was invented, so they've capped the block size and forced everyone to use complex upgrades like Segwit and Lightning Network out of necessity. 

Now /r/bitcoin is full of assholes, shills, and authoritarians who lack the economic understanding that people will flee to cheaper and simpler solutions. They also lack the understanding of open source software or they wouldn't be surprised or mad that we can simply opt out of the curated, censored, and crippled version of Bitcoin.

Over 2 years ago /r/bitcoin started banning people for resisting these changes. They banned anyone who even wanted to discuss non Core proposals. Now they're mad that we left. https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3h9cq4/its_time_for_a_break_about_the_recent_mess/"

I wouldn't call it a cheap knock-off, the segwit fork can be a reasonable settlement layer (with LN, banking, etc) for a small community in an extremely memory deprived World if some Apocalypse happens. It just isn't bitcoin.
Right. The report needs to be corrected. Maybe you should post about that in /r/bitcoin...? Oh wait...you can't. I guess all the people who are most likely to want to complain about this have had their records 'set straight' so they'll never hear about it. How can this be solved then? It's a paradox. The record can't be set straight as long as the record is already being 'set straight'. How did this impossible situation come to pass? Mathematicians should study this.
"> the original report wasn't true. bcash isn't a continuation of the original chain.

But Bitcoin Cash is, while the blegacy coin of the bcore implementation is a non-cash system and therefore - by definition - not Bitcoin."
"> segregated witness caused the split in the chain

Segwit ""caused"" the chain split in the same way that an abused wife's dirty dishes ""caused"" her husband to beat her.

You're making an emotional argument, not a logical one.  Technically, Bitcoin Cash hard forked off from Bitcoin on August 1st, 3 weeks before segwit activated.  I'm not interested in what emotions the Bitcoin Cash supporters had, or what they were feeling when they voluntarily chose to split off from Bitcoin.  That's irrelevant."
"> If a pre-august bitcoin node spends an anyone-can-spend transaction, they get banned from the segwit network

No, their transaction will simply never be mined, because you need a miner to include that tx in a block, and miners are enforcing segwit, so that tx will be invalid, and never get mined.

You may lose some peers though."
"> If a pre-august bitcoin node spends an anyone-can-spend transaction, they get banned from the segwit network.

False. The transaction is rejected, they aren't banned from the network. They *may* get banned by the peers they're connected to, if they repeatedly try to perform invalid actions."

"Bingo. In hindsight, Segwit has done basically nothing for scaling. Even the Core wallet doesn't support Segwit from the GUI, and hardly anybody has begun the insane task of rewriting wallets to support it. Not to mention, the main developer of Segwit (G Maxwell) is no longer working for Blockstream. 

Supporting Segwit seems to be mostly pointless as it doesn't do anything other than horribly bastardize the transaction format. ""Fixing malleability"" was a big strawman created by Core minions - malleability was just an excuse used by Mark Karpeles for Gox's loss of millions of BTC. There really haven't been significant losses from malleability. "

Not sure how you came to this conclusion. I say ""Different"", you can say ""inferior"" all you want, but you're going to need to to do better than that to convince me that Bitcoin (RIP) SegWit, or BitcoinCash are better than Eth."
">  Then through the original consensus method some changes were made and only blocks with versions of 2 were valid. This was a hard fork

You're incorrect.  You can make a block with any version you want.  There are no consensus rules that dictate that.  The block version is mostly used for signaling soft fork upgrades."
"You're right.  My bad.

Then yes, that would still be bitcoin.  No rules are being broken, and nothing can stop the miners from voluntarily deciding to stop claiming the block reward.  If a miner broke the agreement, claimed a reward, and split the chain, the market would decide which fork is more valuable, but old nodes would see both chains as valid (this is the important part).  So we'd be in a ""longest valid chain"" scenario."

Lol.  Thanks for proving my point.  No one accepts 0-conf because they'd be stupid to do so.  0-conf txs can easily be double spent.  Are you really not aware of that?  There is no security in 0-conf txs.

On top of that, you ignored my point that Bitcoin has 0-conf txs too.  RBF is *optional* and must be marked in advance.  So regular non-RBF txs with zero confirmations in Bitcoin have the exact same security as in Bitcoin Cash (which is none).  0-conf is essentially a gentleman's agreement.  It's nonsense."

It's spelled 'Ethereum'.

RipplePay was pre-bitcoin (that was what Hearn was referencing) and later became Ripple in 2012.

The only reason why people buy eth or ripple is because they don't understand the supply and demand effects of high supply coins.  They just think ""oh this is cheaper, I can get rich quicker"".  New altcoins can be created every day, so they will always eat into Bitcoin's total market dominance, because there's always a newb looking for the next ""get rich quick scheme"".

Ethereum is centralized, period.  Whatever Vitalik dictates becomes the new consensus rules.  It's not a competitor to Bitcoin.  I wish eth well, because I own a lot of them, but it's not bitcoin.  It can never be bitcoin. It has inferior characteristics."
You're right, but some of the infrastructure was being developed before Bitcoin and I think is important to acknowledge from a historical perspective. Saying that Bitcoin created Ripple is simply not true, some of the earliest Bitcoin developers were inspired by Ripplepay.
"The rules for new block versions were when 750 of the previous 1000 blocks had the new version the hard fork was activated and when 950 of the previous 1000 blocks had the new version then the previous version was no longer valid and the new rules were in effect.

Version 2 added a new requirement of having the block height in the coinbase input.

Version 3 added the requirement of strict DER signature encoding.

Version 4 added the OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY op code.


https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0034.mediawiki
> 75% rule: If 750 of the last 1,000 blocks are version 2 or greater, reject invalid version 2 blocks. (testnet3: 51 of last 100)

> 95% rule (""Point of no return""): If 950 of the last 1,000 blocks are version 2 or greater, reject all version 1 blocks. (testnet3: 75 of last 100)

https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#block-versions"
"I think we are just arguing semantics now.

I am a software developer and to me a hard fork is a change that requires clients to update software in order to continue functioning. I am sure it depends on the industry and type of software though.

I gave you that link to the developer guide in a previous comment and I have read it. Sure the actual block versions could be considered a ""stricter"" rule update, but they had actual protocol updates tied to them as well, some of which ""loosened"" rules.

Here is the definition by [bitcoin.it](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Hardfork).
> A hardfork is a change to the bitcoin protocol that makes previously invalid blocks/transactions valid, and therefore requires all users to upgrade.

The block 3 version upgrade made the OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY op code valid. So prior to the fork, transactions with that op code were not valid and after it they are. And any user validating blocks would have to update to accept these new transactions or they would no longer be able to validate the chain. Isn't that by definition a hard fork? It is not making rules stricter, like you are saying the definition is."
"No, here's what happened.  The version field in the block header is a 32 byte integer.  Initially, as long as it was a valid 32 byte integer, it was valid.

Since then, they have been slowly softforking additional restrictions.  They started rejected v1, then rejected v2, and so on.  Each time that happens, it's a soft fork, because it doesn't break any rule, it just makes the rule stricter each time.

So we went from a scenario where anything was valid, to a scenario where anything above 1 was valid, to a scenario where anything above 2 was valid and so on.  Each time, the rule gets stricter and stricter, but it never breaks any previous rule.  This is why all of these are soft forks.

It would be the equivalent of making a new rule that says the block size is now 999kb, then a new rule that says the block size is now 998kb, then 997kb.  Each time, the blocksize rule gets stricter, but they are all still under 1mb, so they never broke a consensus rule.

[You can read more in the developer guide](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#block-versions)"
"You too.  I've enjoyed our discussion, and I will at least admit that I acknowledge /r/bitcoin's censorship, and I don't approve of it.

However, from a purely technical point of view, I still believe that segwit + Lightning is the best way forward.

Have a good one."
"Okay, so maybe version 2 was a soft fork by that definition. I am pretty sure all blocks before that had version 1. But what about 3, 4, and BIP 9? They all required miners to update the version field and protocol to remain valid. 

edit - I think maybe you are thinking of transaction version, which is a different thing. All blocks before the first BIP 34 version 2 block had a version of 1."
"This is fair. I understand your position here, and don't really have much more to add. 

It has been an interesting debate, and something that I don't think could have happened on that other forum. The pro-segwit position is not popular here, and that tends to also shut down discussion. I expect that most of that unpopularity comes from being tied so directly to the censorship that has been occurring in the other forum over the years, not to mention the astroturfing. I know it has _certainly_ biased yours truly. 

I got into the cryptospace because as a nerd, I thought it was technologically brilliant. I have been very much soured on the entire ecosystem once the politics started, and the censorship sure didn't help. I miss the days of _consensus_, but I do not expect that to ever happen again.

Have a nice morning, afternoon, evening or night, wherever you are! (this goes for anyone else who has read this far as well!)"
"But it is backwards compatible.

What it looks like is that there was no previous rule.  The block version previously could have been anything.  They created a softfork, that simply said block versions must be at least v2 or higher.

Since block version v2 was previously valid, enforcing v2 blocks didn't break any existing consensus rule, which is why it's a soft fork.

For instance, before this was enforced, you were free to make a block with a v2 version number or higher.  However after this rule went into effect, you were required to.  That's a classic soft fork scenario.

The rule of thumb for soft fork vs hard fork is, ""Does this change break an existing consensus rule?""  If so, it's a hard fork.  If not, it's a soft fork.

This change did not break any existing consensus rules."
"I believe there is a difference between a bug that alters the protocol to behave differently than designed, and a bug in a user-developed smart contract implemented on top of the protocol layer.

Bitcoin's coin supply was known in advance (never more than 21,000,000).  A bug allowed more than that.  This affected the core protocol, and was not what was agreed upon.  Without a bug fix, Bitcoin is dead.

The DAO was a user-developed smart contract that had nothing to do with the ethereum protocol.  The protocol itself was fine.  You can't claim ""censorship resistant smart contracts"", then say, ""But except for this one.. We need to censor this one because I lost a lot of money!""  The very first paragraph on ethereum.org says, ""applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third-party interference.""  Lol.  The DAO hard fork broke this promise."
Yeah, I don't understand why it says that. If the definition of hard fork is a change that is not backwards compatible, then requiring a new block version is a hard fork. 
Yeah absolutely, there is discussion about this for the same reason. Mike Hearn though is one of the most respected bitcoin experts in the world, so his confirmation is just about the next best thing after confirmation from satoshi himself.
That's why it's so important to pay attention to the other person's attitude yourself before correcting them: otherwise we scold someone who is already repentant.
Easy solution for you then: Go Away.
"Thank you for expanding on that.

Just like BTC/BCH, we have ETH and ETC. Unlike BTC/BCH, it's quite clear to me that ETC is a dead-end with ETH maintaining momentum. BTC/BCH is as i said above, simply bickering over the corpse of bitcoin.

I hope you also lost all respect for bitcoin when it did the exact same rollback. Remember the rollback of the accidental 92 million bitcoin in  2010? How bout the accidental fork in 2013 due to a database layer change? New technology is hard, and mistakes happen. It gets much harder when censorship and politics get involved."
"So it seems we were both wrong.  Yes, the version number is a consensus rule (I was wrong about that).  But it was not a hard fork (You were wrong about that).  It was a soft fork.  It says it right in the spec:

>   BIP: 34

>  Layer: Consensus (soft fork)

> All older clients are compatible with this change. Users and merchants should not be impacted."
"> Yes, your stupid answers flip flop. 

Nothing I said is a ""flip flop"".  Nothing I said is contradictory.  Channels still open and close.  That happens on the main blockchain, which requires miners.  While your channels are opened, you can do an unlimited number of off-chain secure, instant txs on Lightning.

You just sound really confused, and instead of making logical arguments, you're resorting to petty personal attacks.  

> Your stupidity is amazing.

No need for this childish nonsense.  Make arguments.  Your cheap naming calling is immature and only makes you look foolish.

> You know very well that 0-conf txs for a beer and other small payments had zero double spend problems. 

Yes, because it's a gentleman's agreement with absolutely no security.  I acknowledged that.  This also works on Bitcoin just as well.  I explained this multiple times, and you ignore it each time because it doesn't fit your narrative."
Again, not saying you are wrong, but I am still skeptical since Satoshi isn't around to also confirm.
Apologies, I'm not trying to troll: but I do feel it's important to point out the fact that you're accidentally spreading misinformation
"I fully agree with you that the smear campaign (from both sides) is ridiculous. 

A couple other questions for you, would you be opposed to a blocksize limit increase? What are your thoughts on the “Segwit bullying” ie like with Coinbase. Shouldn’t it be up to Coinbase to decide if they want to use Segwit? After all it was a fork created with the intent of being optional. If you have a soft fork that is expected to have everyone use it, wouldn’t it be far better to implement this as a hard fork after achieving consensus?"
[deleted]
Dood! you just replied to a bot!
"Have a look at my post history, I'm a bot ;)"
"Vitalik unilaterally decided to censor a smart contract in order to reverse a legitimate transcation (remember the DAO?)

I lost respect for Ethereum then.  It is not censorship resistant.  It is not immutable.  It is centrally controlled.

Like I said.  I still own ethereum because I know it will increase in value in the future.  But it can never lead be the blockchain revolution.  "
"> I claimed each channel allows me to make infinite Bitcoin txs. But I said that opening and closing channels happen on chain.

Honestly.

Bankster?  You're very confused..  This goes a step further than Bitcoin, and keeps tx details private.  The banks won't like that.  Alos, ""no one"" will use it?  It's not even out of beta, and there are hundreds of users.  By the end of the year, I predict there will be more Lightning usage than Bitcoin Cash usage.  Instant, secure, dirt cheap txs on Lightning will destroy the only talking point that Bitcoin Cash has.  Also, how does Lightning destroy mining when channels need to be opened and closed on the Bitcoin blockchain?  Those txs require miners.  You don't seem to even understand the nonsense you're spewing.  It's comical.

> They always did, you ignoramus.

You don't have a clue what you're talking about.  Give me some examples then.  I know shapeshift isn't stupid enough to accept 0-conf on Bitcoin Cash.  Are there even any other merchants that accept Bitcoin Cash at all?

Again 0-conf is 0-security.  This isn't a model to rely on, and it's not unique to Bitcoin Cash."
"> Bitcoin Cash enables 0-confirmation payments, but we have both models now.

0-conf txs means 0 security.  A non-confirmed tx can be double-spent, and may never confirm for a number of reasons.  This isn't a ""model"" at all, and you'd be hard pressed to find a business dumb enough to accept 0-conf txs.

> Don't you agree that the Lightning UX is very problematic in many ways?

In the same way that the Bitcoin UX was problematic when it first came out, 9 years ago.  Developers will make it easier with time.  Take a look at the [Zap wallet](https://github.com/LN-Zap).  Their primary focus is ease of use.  So it's not a long term problem at all in my eyes.

> You state you want to keep the network decentralized. Yet lightning can't be decentralized by nature.

Yet reality proves that article wrong.  Check out the [Lightning network topology](https://lnmainnet.gaben.win/?100=) on mainnet.  A network is centralized if you pick 2 random nodes, and there is only 1 path between them.  A network is decentralzied if there are many paths between them.  The more nodes, the more channels, the more decentralized.  Right now there are many paths between me and most other nodes.  This will be a sliding scale over time.  Regardless though, the more important thing is that the base layer remains as decentralized as possible.  Even if Lightning became more centralized, there is still no third party custodial trust.

> Do you support censoring dissenting opinions? 

Not at all, and I hate that /r/bitcoin engages in it.  

> Why do you spent so much time supporting these censored forums? 

Because Lightning cannot be discussed here.  It's downvoted to oblivion in seconds.  There are never any legitimate discussions about the benefits here.  Maybe I won't get banned, but I can't start a legitimate discussion.  It will never go above ""1"" upvote.

> Why do you use terms like ""bcash""?

For the same reason I call McDonalds ""Mickey D's"" and Jennifer Lopez ""J-Lo"".  It's a short nickname composed of the first letter of ""Bitcoin"" followed by the word ""cash"".  it also helps differentiate legitimate Bitcoin from the altcoin.  Many people are likely confused by all the Bitcoin forks like Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Diamond, etc).  It's dangerous, and the names should be unique to avoid confusion.."
Just to complete my analogy in the second paragraph. Note that most   Chinese know there is censorship. They just think it's for the greater good or not that bad. They will never notice that whatever happened in that town in Taiwan was hidden from them. 
"As someone who created this account for rbitcoin and got perma-banned from rbitcoin a year back due to demonstrating (having a guy asking about censorship post keywords and seeing the posts showing normal to him but not showing in a browser he wasn't logged in with the keywords back then being ""classic censorship AXA /r/btc/"") the silent-hiding bot to a guy asking about it in an empty thread when the mods were saying there was no censorship even though mass bans went down a year before that (two years ago) coupled with mass removal of comments (including the most upvoted comments of its time), the silent-hiding I mentioned, and the targetted BS that goes down now-a-days (can't outright ban and hide things that got too big such as /r/btc/ anymore), I beg to differ.
 
Also, have you ever experienced the  great firewall of China? Search in ""tank man"" in front of a chinese guy claiming there is no censorship, it shows images of tank man. Google it again after a while: nothing. Google some town's name that also happens to exist in Taiwan. Nothing that day because some shit that makes communist china look bad happened there that day. Your chinese friend would not even register the latter as suspicious.

It's only after Bitcoin that the idea of using a consensus based cryptographic mechanism was brought in, and Ripple was developed entirely separately to Ripplepay.

They share a name, a small amount of the community, and an idea... but they're completely different things. The Ripplepay developer was basically not involved in Ripple's development

The whole ""Ripple was created in 2004/5"" is basically nonsense from the XRP community: they're two completely different systems that share a name."

Right, go to the censored sub instead.
Don't forget that the signatures all start to disappear and no one can verify anything.

Thanks for answering. To clarify, if Segwit, or something similar were implemented with a hard fork, without all of the “convoluted code” to make old nodes work, would you be more inclined to accept it? After all it is intended to be an increase in efficiency, correct?
"> So by your account their must have been a hard fork

There was an unintentional bug sometime in 2013.  Fixing the bug made it incompatible with previous version.
 
> even though it's blockchain is backward compatible all the way to the genesis block?

Bitcoin Cash's blockchain is not compatible with anything before August 1st.  You keep proving that you don't understand how consensus works.

Bitcoin Cash broke 2 consensus rules when it forked from the Bitcoin network.  That means it is *not* backwards compatible.  It was a hard fork.  What aren't you understanding about this?  What I'm saying isn't controversial.  It's a fact.

Segwit on the other hand (like CSV, P2SH, CLTV, and RBF) were all designed as softforks, which means that they are fully compatible with the existing consensus rules.  None of those upgrades broke any Bitcoin consensus rules.

So again, if you take Bitcoin software from before August 1st, 2017, and turn it on, it will *reject* Bitcoin Cash blocks, but it will *fully sync* with the segwit chain.  This is indisputable proof that Segwit continues the Bitcoin blockchain."
"The inadvertent orphaned blocks from a bug is not what I am talking about.

Originally blocks were only valid if their version field's value equalled 1. Then through the original consensus method some changes were made and only blocks with versions of 2 were valid. This was a hard fork. It happened through version 4, and now only valid BIP 9 values are valid in the block version field.

So if hard forks create alt coins you should only be supporting a chain with version 1 blocks. "
"> Hard-forks make for cleaner upgrades.

That's your opinion.  I have the exact opposite opinion, for the reasons I stated above.  Messy hard fork chain splits are *not* cleaner, and more developers agree with me.

> Soft-forks allow a minority to push unpopular changes.

False.  With a soft fork, you need a majority to enforce the new rules, otherwise a chain split can occur.  It would have been very messy if only a minority of nodes or miners tried to push through segwit.  The reality is that a majoirty of the nodes, and 100% of the miners enforce segwit."
"> What if a future soft fork removed the block reward entirely, would you still call that Bitcoin? 

That would be a hard fork, not a soft fork.  The coin distribution algorithm is already set in stone.  The reward halves every 210,000 blocks.  If you change that algorithm, it's a hard fork."
"Segwit (No2x) only had about 30% support.

The Hong Kong and New York agreements got around 90% (miner) support. They proposed Segwit activation, followed by 2X 3 months later.

We now have Segwit, but NO2X. A vocal minority, with lots of funding, was able to push the Bitcoin community in their preferred direction. High fees and dwindling market share are now the result.
"
The messy chain split was due to a vocal minority dictating how the coin should scale.
"> There was an unintentional bug sometime in 2013. Fixing the bug made it incompatible with previous version.

I think that's a hard fork (intentional or unintentional) by your definition since the old software was rejecting blocks unless the users upgraded their software, correct? 

However, I think you are also saying that since there was consensus among the miners to upgrade their software back then it was not really a hard fork, but a soft fork even though previous versions could not accept the new blocks.

So Bitcoin Cash is not the first hard fork/upgrade, as I always suspected.  The only difference is that there is split in the main chain where one group of miners mine the legacy chain with the new Segwit consensus rule, and another group of miners (some of them are mining both chains) also mine the legacy chain with a modified set of consensus rules (Bitcoin Cash) requiring users to upgrade their software in order to benefit from the new features. I think that clarifies it."
"> By the end of the year, I predict there will be more Lightning usage than Bitcoin Cash usage

Yes, Ripple was an inspiration to the very first bitcoin developers, at least Mike Hearn. Parts of ripplepay infrastructure later turned into the Ripple we know today. Emails between Hearn and Satoshi Nakamoto confirming: https://pastebin.com/Na5FwkQ4

I stand corrected. I saw that somewhere and nobody said otherwise till your post. 
My opinion is that if it is backwards compatible and is an improvement it's OK. If it is not backwards compatible and not an improvement it is not ok. 
True enough, but some subs spend more time on promoting their coin than trying to pull down other coins. The degree in which this does or does not happen alludes to the level of propergander of that sub.  R/btc shit talks Bitcoin to a silly degree. 
At least without Segwit everything would be compatible after any further forks/changes. At this point BTC has painted itself into a corner.
"No. Segwit makes efficiency worse in all real-world metrics. It is only more ""efficient"" in terms of needing less of that precious 1MB block space.

If you want to validate incoming transactions, you need witness data anyhow, and can just throw away old transactions entirely. If you are a full archiving node (like an explorer), you will want to keep everything anyhow. I don't see the use case for keeping the entire chain but throwing away the witness data. Even if you had such a use-case, you can just trim the witness data client-side with no protocol changes needed."
"But you are not watching. You are actively antagonizing. If you don't like this place and find it ""annoying and shitty"" then just go away. Troll somewhere else."
"Nice selective quote there.

> A hard fork would have been cleaner and honest, but politics and censorship got in the way of that and killed bitcoin.

The entire point of a protocol change is that all the nodes agree to follow the new protocol, as has been demonstrated multiple times, _including_ bitcoin cash. Instead censorship and politics threw out the simple solution. Now you have the technical baggage of watching for old nodes doing something that is now forbidden whereas a proper hard fork would have left them out of the new protocol all together. 

These politics and censorship successfully fractured the network, and now the technically superior Etherium, _AND_ inferior ripple have both walked into the schism. Good job blockstream!"
"Not at all. 

You think reddit is public owned? LOL"
"I meant to write a ""site-wide ban"", meaning all of reddit.  I was quoting a reddit rule, which has nothing to do with the r/bitcoin mods.  Like I said.  I don't care, I was just giving you a heads up.

But still, segwit usage is higher than Bitcoin Cash usage.  That's like making fun of someone for being poor when you have less money than they do.  It's hypocritical.

> hard forks can be shoved unto users via soft forks enforcing non-protocol stuff.

I honestly don't follow this."
Then that means that Satoshi made bitcoin into an altcoin when he launched the first hard fork
"> Do you realize Bitcoin Segwit is already an alt coin by your definition?

There were no planned hard forks.  Yes, a hard fork inadvertently occurred due to a bug, and decisions had to be made.  But whenever that hard fork happened (2013 i think?), the community moved forward on a single chain.  That single chain was Bitcoin.  That chain is now the segwit chain, and segwit doesn't break any of the protocol rules.

> Also, the original block size limit was not 1 MB.

Again, blocksize reductions are a soft fork."
"Actually the minority broke away to form the altcoin bch. That's why they did it, they had no support.

That's fine, it's the rewrite of history and the twisted logic that is weird. "

NIST has a terrible reputation, though. Just look at how terrible their 9/11 reporting was.
"Actually, it said Segwit ""caused"" a hard fork. This is technically true, in the sense that knowing it was impending led to people *creating* a hard fork. But, if you're in the stated target audience, you wouldn't know the history, and might interpret it to mean Segwit itself created the hard fork directly."

Censoring it? There's like 100 threads over there right now talking about it. They're actively disputing the claim made in the NIST report. They're not censoring it.
"To be clear, Core and Cash both forked. Core soft forked and Cash hard forked. The difference between a hard fork and soft fork is that hard fork are not backwards compatible. Whether or not software changes are backwards compatible is often ""accidents"" of how the code is written and unrelated to the scope of change. That is definitely the case with here. Core's changes are ""invisible"" to old nodes but they drastically change how Bitcoin works both technically and economically. So in the general sense that a fork is a change in how software works, Core would be more of a fork than Cash."
">  segwit forked activated 

If you were around back then you remember the mining voting and the thresholds people were following for that voting. You also remember that the voting and corresponding activation for segwit were done following the segwitx2x compromise that never came to fruition as the most cynical (and most correct) back then were saying would happen.

The cash branch of Bitcoin was a life raft thrown just before that became obvious to everyone else a few months after and who is a moderate like me who believes real World adoption shouldn't be dropping left and right at this moment over what was obviously a temporary limit, never defined as part of the protocol and promised repeatedly and since its inception to be raised years ago. 

You can almost call it an ""user activated fork"" if will, of Bitcoin, responding to a central activated fork followed by a community over eager to prevent a schism (schism which was guaranteed 2 something years back after some people decided to play dirty).
"
How can Segwit activation not have forked the chain? Segwit transactions were not valid before it was activated and now they are. That is the same as saying bigger blocks were not valid and now they are. Both Segwit and Cash forked.

I agree with this post. This sub does not have anything to fear from factual information and truth. We have no reason to lie. The original Bitcoin is no more. The community split. The software forked. The blockchain was duplicated and the two chains are incompatible with each other. 

So neither Bitcoin Core or Bitcoin Cash can claim that their chain is the original. The original is dead. However the original IDEA is not. And I believe that Bitcoin Cash is more in line with the original idea. Bitcoin Core does not like the original idea, they would like to change the original idea. 

And now they get go their separate way. There are now two witnesses to the original idea and they are segregated.  "

The blockstream propaganda brainwashed people to think hard forks are something dangerous, irresponsible, etc, while their soft fork is less democratic, leaves no options to users if it needs to work out and it is a complete failure if it is not adopted.

Why they did it? To keep the bogus claim that they are the original bitcoin. A hard fork would have immediately have made them an altcoin."

"I agree, also regardless of anyone's stance on the topic, saying that Segwit ""caused a hardfork"" is either wrong or misleading (yes maybe from a political/social standpoint it caused a hardfork, but is that what we are talking about?). 

Bitcoin Cash purposely changed the block size limit and added replay protection and this requires any node or client to update their software to use Bitcoin Cash and receive Bitcoin Cash blocks and verify transactions. The same (regardless of whether you like it or not) is not true for Segwit as clients could stay on their legacy software and still receive blocks (perhaps as some would argue with degraded security).

I see now that they have allowed ones through that disparage the Bitcoin Cash name why censoring the ones with post titles that don't. Go figure. 
It does. NIST job is 'measurement science, standards and technology'. Bitcoin is one of many technologies they evaluate. Bitcoin implementations measured relative to the foundational specification, (the whitpaper), and comments on adherance and genesis of variations is all.

>In 2017, Bitcoin users adopted an improvement proposal for Segregated Witness (known as SegWit, where transactions are split into two segments: transactional data, and signature data) through a soft fork. SegWit made it possible to store transactional data in a more compact form while maintaining backwards compatibility.  However, a group of users had different opinions on how Bitcoin should evolve – and developed a hard fork of the Bitcoin blockchain titled Bitcoin Cash. Rather than implementing the SegWit changes, the developers of Bitcoin Cash decided to simply increase the blocksize. When the hard fork occurred, people had access to the same amount of coins on Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.

"The report is factually incorrect.  It claims that the segwit forked activated *before* the Bitcoin Cash fork, which is wrong.  Bitcoin Cash forked off from Bitcoin on August 1st, when a block greater than 1mb was mined.  Segwit activated three weeks later, continuing the original chain.

It also incorrectly claims that Bitcoin Cash is the continuation of the original chain.  It isn't, because Bitcoin Cash changed two separate consensus rules.  It changed the blocksize, which makes it incompatible with the pre-August Bitcoin network, and it also changed the difficulty adjustment algorim, which also makes it fully incompatible with the pre-August Bitcoin network.

The segwit soft fork didn't split the chain at all when it activated (again 3 weeks after Bitcoin Cash forked).  Segwit is fully compatible with the pre-August Bitcoin network, and is the only continuation of the original chain.

"> How can Segwit activation not have forked the chain?

You have to understand the difference between a soft fork and a hard fork.  A soft fork doesn't break any existing rules.  It simply adds new rules to the network.  For instance, if the existing rule says that blocks must be under 1mb, and a new rule says that blocks must be under 800kb, that is a soft fork.  Technically, the new blocks (under 800kb) are still compatible with the previous rules.  Even if your node is not upgraded, you will still see the new 800kb blocks as valid.  There is no network split.

That brings us to a hard fork.  A hard fork *breaks* existing rules.  So if the existing rule says that blocks must be under 1mb, and a new rules says that blocks must be under 2mb, then a 1.5mb block would split the network in two.  Non-upgraded nodes will reject the 1.5mb block, but upgraded nodes would say it's perfectly fine.

Segwit was designed as a soft fork.  Segwit txs and blocks are valid to old, non-upgraded nodes.  There are just some new rules that went into effect, mainly dealing with how to verify the signatures, which the old nodes don't see.

> Segwit transactions were not valid before it was activated and now they are.

Technically segwit txs were valid before segwit activated, they would have just been seen as ""anyone can spend"" txs back then.  But they would have been perfectly valid and happily mined into blocks.  No nodes would have rejected them."
"In my opinion, based upon the actual history, the NIST draft gets it wrong.  They say:

""NISTIR 8202 (DRAFT) BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY OVERVIEW
41

1055 8.1.2 Bitcoin Cash (BCC)

1056 In July 2017, approximately 80 to 90 percent of the Bitcoin computing power voted to

1057 incorporate Segregated Witness (SegWit, where transactions are split into two segments:

1058 transactional data, and signature data), which made it possible to reduce the amount of data being

1059 verified in each block. Signature data can account for up to 65 percent of a transaction block, so

1060 a change in how signatures are implemented could be useful. When SegWit was activated, it

1061 caused a hard fork, and all the mining nodes and users who did not want to change started calling

1062 the original Bitcoin blockchain Bitcoin Cash (BCC). Technically, Bitcoin is a fork and Bitcoin

1063 Cash is the original blockchain. When the hard fork occurred, people had access to the same

1064 amount of coins on Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.""


Bitcoin Cash is a fork.  Bitcoin Segwit is a fork.  Neither is the true legacy chain.

Edit:  Format fixes"
"Paging /u/bitcoinxio

Waiting for your reply, truth is out there."
"I just got banned the other day for suggesting Bitcoin Cash or Litecoin in the thread about Starbucks picking a crypto.

The message was like ""Bcash is an altcoin not appropriate for this sub blah blah""

I replied to the ban message with ""this is literally a thread about which alternative to bitcoin Starbucks might choose...come on""

I've contributed several articles and technical discussions over there, I'm not a troll. But I guess for them anyone with a different opinion is dangerous."
"The original description was factually inaccurate. It described Segwit as a hard fork, which is false, and failed to explain that BCH was in fact a hard fork.

Whether you think Bitcoin Cash is ideologically the contination of the Bitcoin white paper or not, the original NIST report was FALSE and the corrected report is at least a lot more accurate."
"> Segwit2x and BIP91 lock-in date was Block 476768 

Segwit2x never activated and is irrelevant.  BIP91 lock-in also changed nothing.  Segwit (BIP141) activated on [block 481,824](https://www.coindesk.com/50-blocks-segwit-bitcoins-coming-upgrade-blockchain-game-changer/), on August 24th, 2017.  That's three weeks after Bitcoin Cash forked.  This is an indisputable fact.

> In order to preserve the main chain free of both segwit and RBF transactions, the Bitcoin hard fork had to occur prior to segwit activation at Block 481,824.

The Bitcoin Cash hard fork didn't ""have"" to be any time.  A few developers chose to fork off of the Bitcoin network on August 1st, and create their own altcoin, which broke at least two Bitcoin consensus rules, making it fully incompatible with the Bitcoin network.  This happened three weeks before segwit activated.

> Consensus rules were changed with the Segwit lock-in and the inclusion of RBF.

Not a single Bitcoin consensus rule was broken with the activation of segwit, RBF, CLTV, CSV, P2SH, or a number of other useful upgrades over the years.  These were all soft forks, designed to be compatible with the existing Bitcoin blockchain.  You're trying to blur the line between soft forks and hard forks.  Soft forks continue the existing chain, and break no consensus rules.  Hard forks split away from the existing chain, and break existing consensus rules.  You need to acknowledge this difference.

> changing the block size and the difficulty adjustment also changed these rules but were also backwards compatible (like Segwit) with the original chain

This is 100% false.  They were incompatible.  You have to download new software and re-import your keys to gain access to your coins on this new blockchain.  Just because they copied the existing ledger balances means nothing.  The software is incompatible.

Here's a test.  Take Bitcoin software that's really old, like 2014 or 2015.  Turn it on.  See which chain it syncs with.  It will explicitly *reject* Bitcoin Cash blocks, and it will happily *accept* segwit blocks.  It will sync fully with the Bitcoin network today.  This proves, without a shadow of a doubt, that the segwit chain is the continuation of the existing Bitcoin chain from before August.  Bitcoin Cash is an altcoin that is incompatible."

">It claims that Segwit activated before the BCH fork, which is wrong. BCH forked off from Bitcoin on August 1st, when a block greater than 1mb was mined. Segwit activated three weeks later, continuing the original chain.

Segwit2x and BIP91 lock-in date was Block 476768 (2017-07-21 00:06Z), which was 10-days prior to the August 1st Bitcoin fork at 12:20Z.  Segwit activation occurred at Block 481,824  (2017-08-24 01:57Z) with the 2 MB activation scheduled at Block 494,784 (which never happened). In order to preserve the main chain free of both segwit and RBF transactions, the Bitcoin hard fork had to occur prior to segwit activation at Block 481,824.

>It also incorrectly claims that BCH is the continuation of the original chain. It isn't, because BCH changed two separate consensus rules. It changed the block size, which makes it incompatible with the pre-August Bitcoin network, and it also changed the difficulty adjustment algorithm, which also makes it fully incompatible with the pre August Bitcoin network.

Consensus rules were changed with the Segwit lock-in and the inclusion of RBF. Changing the block size and the difficulty adjustment also changed these rules but were also backwards compatible (like Segwit) with the original chain otherwise people who had bitcoins before the August 1st would no longer have their bitcoins on the new chain.  Incompatibility with the existing bitcoin network only meant new transactions and block creation had to occur on the new chain.

>Segwit soft fork didn't split the chain at all when it activated (again 3 weeks after BCH forked). Segwit is fully compatible with the pre-August Bitcoin network, and is the only continuation of the original chain.

Think of the August 1st fork as an upgrade, like Microsoft occasionally did with MS Work and Excel where there are new features and perhaps a new file format, but you can still run your old docs and spreadsheets on the new upgrade because it’s backward compatible. Of course, one could reasonably assert,  as the NIST authors are doing, that Segwit is the new upgrade, and Cash is just returning to the original Bitcoin protocol changing only the maximum block size to improve network capacity and changing the difficulty adjustment so it can coexist with the new Bitcoin Segwit upgrade."
"I was thinking this, the government should have no business in crypto, but then again ""NIST"" is the ""better"" parts of the government.

I think they helped a lot with cryptography, and I think they keep a bug vulnerability database the https://nvd.nist.gov

So they have done some useful thing, this report is also particularly useful."
Sounds like r/politics 
Source of NIST report?
Btrash 
Perhaps we could just ask Satoshi to send some first coins to a new Bitcoin address, even a SegWit one. Guess which chain would be immediately compatible. 
Ah, if it is backwards compatible then the chain remains intact. If it is not, it is a fork, such as bch. Everything else is appropriation. 
"Do you still support the North Corean non-cash (non-Bitcoin) system? 
Crazy."
"If you want to be technical about it, at least get it correct. What it says exactly is that:

>When SegWit was activated, it caused a hard fork

Even if you wanted to claim that the Bitcoin Cash hard fork was caused by Segwit, it was definitely not caused by the activation of Segwit. Bitcoin Cash had already forked off by the time Segwit activated."

I've been around Bitcoin since mid-2011.  [My reddit history proves it](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/lb0qj/how_much_bitcoin_have_you_personally_mined/)

> You also remember that the voting and corresponding activation for segwit were done following the segwitx2x compromise that never came to fruition as the most cynical (and most correct) back then were saying would happen.

Revisionist history.  I remember that the UASF was scheduled to go into effect on August 1st, so the miners had a choice.  They could start signaling to activate segwit, or they could have their blocks rejected by the network.  Right before the UASF activated, 100% of the miners started signaling for segwit.  I predicted that the 2x portion would never go through, and the miners would back out before the November hard fork.  I was right.

> The cash branch of Bitcoin was a life raft thrown just before..

Yes, that's what I said.  Bitcoin Cash hard forked off of the Bitcoin network *before* segwit activated.  We're in agreement.  The reasons are just emotions.  The only thing that matters is the technicals.  The NIST report falsely claims that Segwit activated *before* Bitcoin Cash.  That is factually incorrect, as I pointed out. 

> You can almost call it an ""user activated fork"" if will, of Bitcoin

Sure, I'd call Bitcoin Cash ""user activated"".  A very small part of the users forked off from Bitcoin to create their own new altcoin, with new consensus rules."
"I appreciate the tip, but I do disagree with what you said.

> So neither Bitcoin Core or Bitcoin Cash can claim that their chain is the original.

If you take node software from a few years ago and start it up, it will fully sync with the segwit chain.  Segwit was designed to be fully compatible with the existing Bitcoin network.  It broke no consensus rules.

This is not true for Bitcoin Cash."
"> NIST have any authority in determining the true bitcoin?

They don't. But as a standards body, it's kinda their job to pick one for people that are into that sort of thing. Their reputation is their product.

Since core makes appealing to authority one of their core arguments, another significant authority disagreeing with them undermines their entire position.

Thank you! Finally I get a tip from these memes
I never supported the banning in r/bitcoin.

However, I don't like what I've seen from BCH proponents or in this subreddit. As if bitcoin has to die for bitcoin cash to succeed. This subreddit has become, totally ridiculous and basically a troll subreddit. I'm not here to troll this whole subreddit is like one massive troll.

Myself and my subjects are aware of the confusion. For instance you seem to think the whole world is on one page.

To ask that question about a forum about a permissionless ledger means that you do not understand bitcoin or are simply trolling. You seem intelligent enough, so I'm going to assume it is the later.

My username? It's a long story
For starters it doesn’t have the word “cash” in it... which is extremely cringeworthy in itself. 
You need to due some reading.
If you prefer some crypto over others based on their names, I think you're in for a ride. But besides this important point of having a specific name are there any other (technical) benefits to using Litecoin? 
Then just Bitcoin alone. Because that's what Bitcoin Cash is.
Not missing anything bud. BTC is king.
I've been lurking around here for years so I'm going based on first hand knowledge. Why don't you explain your view of the history of this sub? 
Of course I don't mind you commenting on any number of my posts and linking to the white paper, although I've read it several times. I know this subreddit was formed before BCH existed and that's sort of what I see as the problem. I think if you were to make it today you'd make it at r/bch. This has gone from a debate on blocksize to two different experiments with block size and with other innovations. These should just be separate attempts, I think. Everyone knows that BCH also has a history going back to the genesis block I just don't like seeing bitcoin criticized in r/btc and really I don't think BCH needs to criticize bitcoin at all. I don't think its good for either bitcoin or bitcoin cash. 
What do people here think the BTC ticker represents? 
Everyone?  I don't think so.
This doesn't mean they think Bitcoin cash is the true bitcoin. It means that bitcoin core is not working for their needs. Personally I don't get the silly fight over the name.
