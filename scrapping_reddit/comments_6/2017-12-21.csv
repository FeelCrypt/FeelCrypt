Yea what a time to be alive 🙌🏻
i was just thinking that lol i was like wait what?
Ah okay yeah just checked and I could do that! Also any faster ways to get more USD into Coinbase/GDAX? I currently have a $15k bank limit but it takes 7 goddamn days to send (according to their estimation). My instant buys have a $500 daily limit (to which suddenly became $300 today while I was checking prices earlier??). I want to be able to put like $1k-$2k that doesn't take years to get on there and add up with fees.
The price before coinbase was 3 when it hit coinbase it was just that but read the gdax status updates from yesterday. Trading enabled, than with in 25 mins it goes into post only mode and from there within an HR the price surge's due to that being the only amount available for you to buy so it 9-9,500 coinbase sees this goes oh shit shut it down. Price drops significantly no of this pictured on the graphs today. Here's the status updates https://status.gdax.com. Walks like a duck sounds like a duck. Shaddy..... Aftermath.
a few orders went in? just those doing insider trading right?
They will react like the always do. Attack every comment that's pro Bitcoin Cash and bring their troll-army. Just like the troll replying to your comment. Check their history and realise they never had an original thought.
Ah okay cool! I'll definitely look into that, thanks!
It's same history, different blockchain. As is the nature of a hard fork. 
"Awesome! I wasn’t watching cuz I am just in the habit of checking my coinbase acct and there is no binance app for iOS that I can find. 

Excellent timing. I just wish I had executed my plan to buy BCH when I saw the coinbase API call added but I missed the easy 50% gains. "
Bitstamp is so not garbage. 
Thanks, I'll try Gemini. I attempted to open an account with Bittrex but they're not taking new users. 
Yeah, they do seem great in some regards. IOTA is what made me (like most people) pay attention to them, and I do like how they support forks. I was considering moving some of my BTC to them in time for the remainder of this slew of upcoming forks for this reason, but the dust issues just put me off.
So you want to swap 1 BTC (that you have) for 1 BCH(that I have)?

the 9,500 was a glitch before trading was officially open. A few orders went through apparently but they weren't representative of actual market prices, just early birds who were somehow able to trade.
Unless they held....I mean you might be a tad annoyed if it played out differently, and you had sold all that BCH. You might hold on to some, just in case. It is what I would do anyway!
"You're right; I've heard good things about Bitstamp (although it'll take several weeks to get your account verified currently). Unfortunately they only offer BTC, ETH, LTC, and XRP trading."
one will be centralized and one won’t
and get the real one, not the cash one.
"Define very. If you don't mind ;-)"
Sad but true. 
"I saw it happen and missed the whole party thanks to the internet shitting itself. Thanks a lot FCC. Time to decentralize the internet.

If there were bitcoin cash pairs I wouldn't have needed to buy Bcore to daytrade in the first place."
"Is it correct that you still can't trade BCH on CoinBase? If so, is there an ETA for when this will happen?

Can't seem to find anything on their Twitter and the subreddit is a shit-show ATM."
"Since Coinbase currently disabled BCH buying could I then do this:

- Deposit USD on Coinbase

- Send to GDAX

- Set a limit order and buy BTC

- Use Shapeshift to BCH

- ???

- HODL"
What else is money good for if not to spend it?
"> Unfortunately they only offer BTC, ETH, LTC, and XRP trading.

yes, totally understand - but then again this was a question about getting or selling BCH. "
Yes me too. Was just reading up on install the wallet on my Linux rig. It's looking good this week... So is zcash!
Best comment I’ve seen in these subs
"I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

I believe that and have some Dash just in case.  It would also explain the consistent gains over the last few weeks.  I think Coinbase will list either Dash or Zcash.
How so? I've used bittrex for 6 months successfully, the only thing to watch out for is the slight fee when trading, make sure you factor it in before you calculate your trades.
"BCH was a hard fork meaning there were disagreements between miners on how to move forward and their code was built off of the original BTC chain. Yes BCH is ahead of the game in terms of fees and speed of transfers but the way BCH markets themself through Bitcoin.com and going on CNBC calling BCH the ""real bitcoin"" is confusing to new people and most definitely is ripping off BTC and trying to ride the BTC hype. It is not the original chain, and the CEO of bitcoin.com shouldn't market it as the ""real bitcoin""."
Pls upload your seppukku on liveleak.
Sell the news. Best time to sell Bitcoin Cash is when it is being pumped hard
The insider trading was done on exchanges outside of GDAX and Coinbase, assuming it happened at all.
Except you can’t buy or sell. 👌 nice. 
"I received BCH from Coinbase because I had BTC stored there on Aug 1st. There may be millions of customers like me who got ""free money"" (correct me if I'm wrong).

How does Coinbase back this with fiat?"
I want to switch to BCH from bitcoin. I only have 200$ worth of Btc in localbitcoins wallet, how much is it gonna cost me sending it to a exodus wallet and converting to bch? Or are there other wallets where its faster to send the Btc?

Yoooo how about that timing! Up to 0.93ish
"Wire.  Go into GDAX, goto ""Deposit"" and send a wire with the clear instructions.  It will arrive same day if you send it early enough in the day.   You'll pay your banks wire fee and GDAX's.  "
