You're angry because I made fun of your silly name before. You are the one who doesn't know how it works. Please read up.
If that true Miners blocking transactions will happen in centralized environments.... ahem .. like bitcoin cash.
Your arrogance is on display and your childishness. It will use a bgp variant. You might be able to find some youtube videos for non technical people like yourself.
"See? Dense. 

Take a hint."
"Almost correct. I don't believe Bitcoin Cash is centralized. I believe that my (and anyone elses) transactions will find a miner that is willing to mine it.

If you believe that Bitcoin (Cash or Legacy) is centralized, please note that it is much easier to take piece of the pie from the centralized miners (just add your own hash rate), than it is for those miners to keep their supermajority (they need to add much more hash power).

This is the reason why mining will never be centralized."
"Stop trying to put words in my mouth. It’s a fundamentally bigoted thing to do.

There are varying degrees of usefulness. There are not varying degrees of uselessness. However, even once you’ve backtracked to “not very useful”, your reasoning is still unsound.

I think you are simply unaware of the ways it is useful, which is why you are saying “it can’t be used for *this*, so I can’t see how it can be used for *anything*”.

My entire point here is to object to the idea that bitcoin is useless as a currency.

Just because I can’t use it doesn’t mean no one can."
"I'm not your buddy. You need to study up! I gave you a resource and you refuse to learn. A love of learning is normally instilled in people as children...

Research bgp"
"In regards to what?
Which part do you believe I don't understand?"
Did you do your research yet?
"> You use a LOT of words to say very little.


You’re dense and a bit of a prick.

I’m sorry for trying to explain this to you."
"> I gave you a resource to learn! 

Yes but the resource **does not contain an answer to the question** buddy.

You can rver and bcash and moron all you want, but the one thing you can't do, is answer the question :)"
I gave you a resource to learn! I'm not a shill for anything. You're such a moron - rver said he will use lighting for bcash
"1) Do you think Bitcoin fees are too high?

2) If so what do you think is the correct solution?

3) Do you think Bitcoin block size should ever be increased?

4) Do you think the high fees are hurting Bitcoin?"

"I studied networking at the graduate level in 1991

bgp does not answer the question

when you send a packet over the internet it does not exhaust a fixed scarce resource

you have to know the quantity of this resource to find a route

you are not allowed to disclose the quantity of the resource

the demoware that's available does not solve the problem"
