"See? Dense. 

Take a hint."
"Almost correct. I don't believe Bitcoin Cash is centralized. I believe that my (and anyone elses) transactions will find a miner that is willing to mine it.

If you believe that Bitcoin (Cash or Legacy) is centralized, please note that it is much easier to take piece of the pie from the centralized miners (just add your own hash rate), than it is for those miners to keep their supermajority (they need to add much more hash power).

This is the reason why mining will never be centralized."

That makes Bitcoin Chainge radical and revolutionary. Each Bitcoin=1 Million Bitcoin Chainge. Bitcoin Chainge is just over 1.3 cent each. Listed only on Waves DEX
Well thats certainly a worthwhile analysis I'll keep your ideas in mind as I go forward. 
As I said in the context of Bitcoin it is accurate. “If its inaccessible to the poor, Bitcoin is neither radical or revolutionary.” 
It should cost 2x28$ + 3$. Otherwise the seller is just receiving a dust amount.
Because it is DECENTRALIZED ! It is what the USERS WANT! ( sarcasm )
"Because the network is congested. There is a hard cap of 1MB per block, which works out to about three transactions per second. Every Bitcoin node stores all transactions in  the blockchain forever. The Core development team have been working on off-chain solutions to increase Bitcoin capacity rather than simply increase the blocksize.

But it backfired: Bitcoin became more popular (and valuable) than they expected, much sooner. There is a huge backlog of transactions. Since there is limited block space, people need to increase their transaction fees if they want to be included in one of the next blocks. And since all fee calculations are estimates, if the backlog is temporarily bigger and you don't realize it, even  a calculated fee may be temporarily too low and your transaction may not be verified for hours, even days....

Bitcoin Cash is a fork which, among other things, increased the block size so there is no backlog. Low fees, first confirmation in minutes: just like Bitcoin used to be."

My main issue is just how centralized it is and the lack of nodes. There are only 1200 nodes compared to bitcoins 10,000. Of those nodes just 5 groups hold a whopping 80% of them. If any of  three (or the two largest) of these groups decided to collaborate they could bring down the whole network. Last I checked the largest 5 control 54% of bitcoin. This would require all them all on board to bring down btc. There's also a large number of small groups that control a significant amount of nodes. All of this on top of what in my opinion was very clear insider trading with the coinbase/ver scandal and Roger vers large control of public opinion after multiple clear pr related pump and dumps.
Yup
lol exactly.  my BTC transactions are fast but to get transactions under 30 mins, I've paid $12, $50, $90, and $13 most recently.
around 25 USD.
Right. So it's not $28.
Not be rude or anything, but if you're bitching about tx fees, why are you championing bch if you're still payng a $1.25 fee? Wouldn't you rather use a currency with even less, or zero, tx fees? And the transaction you're bragging about on bch took double the transaction fee as mine, it's only lower once you value it in fiat .000249 vs .0005. In what world would you pay an extra $1.25 fee to buy a cup of coffee and then get on the internet and brag about how low that was? Get real. if you want to make up moronic things so you can try and tout bcash go use the bch subreddit.
I'm gonna decline to show the exact transaction, I don't really feel comfortable posting that. It was on block 497777, click around random transactions there if you really want. All the ones I clicked on were almost identical, with avg times between 5 mins and 20 minutes, and the avg tx fee between .0002 and .0005. 
Not that massive, I think... [current median fee is $18](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-median_transaction_fee.html#3m). How many inputs would tx need to have so that $40 is not enough for fast confirmation? 5, 6? Doesn't sound so massive to me...
Who is BHC? 
"BCH’s only advantage is larger block sizes.  BTC could raise its block size too, and poof, in an instant this entire forked coin becomes unnecessary. 

So why doesn’t BTC just do it?  One side of the story is that the Core devs are stubborn pricks who refuse to relinquish control.  

But the other side of the story is that the pressure created by the unusability of BTC currently is what’s going to encourage users, devs, & exchanges to adopt off-chain scaling solutions more rapidly.  

I view it similarly to rising gas prices incentivize people to start driving more fuel efficient vehicles.  If OPEC just keeps pushing oil prices down every time they creep up, the progress is much slower & nonexistent. "

No. The block sizes in Bitcoin cash can scale as large as needed. So fees should never rise as long as we continue to increase the block sizes. This is how regular Bitcoin worked until the development team was taken over by a corporation
Big is about exclusivity. It's only for those that can afford it.  Blockchains that can be used by everyone cheaply at scale are coming, but don't even exist yet.  The crypto currency that does eventually scale to meet everyone's need might be called Bitcoin or it might be something else. It might not even be a blockchain.  Bitcoin is currently the most secure distributed network which is why it is worth as much as it is.
It's number 12 right now, that's respectable, right? RIGHT?

Tip 0.001 BCH /u/tippr for conceptual imagery 
"Bitcoin Core never increased block sizes so your last sentence is just facetious.

This would only scale if technology scales at a faster pace; more computing power, increased storage capacity, increased network throughput, etc. It's highly unlikely that this will be the case.

Does BCH have a solution other than increasing the block size, i.e. a proper solution?"
How is it decided to increase block size?
"> The block sizes in Bitcoin cash can scale as large as needed.

Can they?

Can they scale to 555 MB per block, just to rival VISA’s current transaction per second volume?  That’s 80 GB per day being added to the blockchain. 

I know Moore’s law should keep our disk space costs decreasing, but even ISP bandwidth in rural areas couldn’t sustain that. "
Actually it was yesterday, 10 minutes, and <5$
"Why? that's basically what Mastercard and Visa are doing with their ledger... they add new harddrives when current ones get filled up with transaction history...

not everyone need to store the whole blockchain though, but you will be able to if you want to.

"My last 4 BCH transactions were free.  Not .00001 cents.  They were absolutely 100% free.

If a miner is mining a block for the reward and it can hold 8mb worth of data and the average block size is 100kb, what does he care if he runs an extra million transactions?  He gets paid the same.

THIS IS HOW BITCOIN IS SUPPOSED TO WORK.

This is how Bitcoin worked 3 years ago, 4 years ago, 5 years ago.  We only had a rise in fees when the blocks became full.

It took a LOT of banker FUD to convince the community that fees are normal."

Here, we have it out.  BTC fans explain how it is a store of value, Satoshi be damned, and ""screw the whitepaper,"" and then complain that someone stole the name.

"Nope.  Not how it works.

You broadcast a BCH transaction via the nodes and it gets to a miner in under a minute.  It is added to the next block without fail.  The process you're describing is BTC not BCH.

Looks like your last transaction was not this year, riiiiight?
"That only works with Ethereum. The reason is that Ethereum transactions are from accounts to accounts, and Bitcoin/most blockchains are from transaction to transaction. This means that:

under Ethereum

* Receiving 10x 1 ETH at the same address will put 10 ETH on it
* You can then use 10 ETH in a single transaction at the same cost it would be if you moved 1 ETH.
* ie: A dust amount is made only when all funds on an account are nearly gone.

under Bitcoin

* Receiving 10x 1 BTC  at the same address will put 10 BTC (transactions) on it
* You can then use 10 BTC in a single transaction, but to do so means you need to link to all 10 previous transactions, which increases the transaction size.
* ie: every transaction can have their own dust amounts.  You do not want to mine and be paid in BTC."
No idea. I was wondering that too

"currently costs $20.99 to get a tx confirmed within 1 hour. 

https://estimatefee.com/"
"I was going to push through a bitcoin transaction the other day and it was over 50 kB due to the inputs, the fee was 0.203 BTC, over $3k USD...

The same EXACT transaction on the BCH chain, 50 kB, was 0.0005 BCH, a $1.25 USD fee.

‘Nuff said"
Show the tx or it didn't happen.
not necessarily... if everyone stop using bitcoin-core, transaction costs will drop to ~0
It is indeed. How the hell does Tron get into these memes??
Any time you transact any amount of btc to anywhere, it requires a fee. 
Ah thanks
Could be
"To spend it you have to reference one or many ""inputs"", while it is behind the same keys you have to pay by the bytes and that will actually make the $3 coffee payment unspendable dust. If the coffee shop accepts the payment, can he then spend it even if he gets an extra transaction fee? If the next guy can't spend what he receives? The answer is quite worrisome: no. To the best of my understanding, transaction value must be much larger than the transaction fee in order to be useful.

For more details about transaction fee calculation see: https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/1195/how-to-calculate-transaction-size-before-sending-legacy-non-segwit-p2pkh-p2sh"
"Every Bitcoin transaction is separate (e.g. in contrast to Ethereum), regardless of which address it is to, and needs to be signed when consumed as an input to a new transaction. Whether you receive to the same address will not affect the cost of spending those transactions.
"
"Transaction fees are important but they will fluctuate with the demand for every blockchain.  You should really have other considerations.

How do transaction fees match up to actual blockchain usage?  With more transactions being transmitted on the network, can any of these coins maintain their lower fees?  6 months ago Ethereum transaction fees were at $0.25.  Now that Ethereum is processing more transactions per day than any other blockchain and has reached its current network limits, it's fees are starting to spike upwards.  How long before Ethereum transactions are $10? I give it 1-2 months.  How about BCH? If it does ever reach block capacity in between hard forks how high do you think it's transaction fees will spike? Tomorrow is way more important than today because today Bitcoin Cash has serviced 40,000 transactions while, Ethereum has serviced 1.2M transactions. We need transactional networks that can process billions or trillions of transactions per day.  Which networks will succeed in making that possible cheaply?

What are the security consideration for each coin?  What is the hash collision rate for each coin's hashing algorithm?  How easy/hard is it to guess a litecoin key vs an ethereum key vs btc or bch? 

What is the hashrate being allocated to the network?  If a POW coin depends on a % of non collusive actors to mine or secure the network?  How hard is it to spin up some servers and overtake the current miners?

I'm just scratching the surface of concerns that anyone putting their money into cryptocurrencies should have.
No amount of memes or shitposts is going to alter the trajectory of a bad currency.

Interesting I actually didn't know that. I wonder how or why anyone would setup a node to process transactions for free though? It costs electricity and power, it has the opportunity cost of not really being able to use the machine for anything else, and also has the opportunity cost of not mining other coins that have either rewards or transaction fees. Maybe some good Samaritan setting up machines for the good of the crypto environment? I'm not super confident in that lol.
At least in the US, it's illegal for them not to accept cash as a form of payment.
Yeah, back in the day you could use BTC in stores.
Good thing he doesn't pay his barber in BTC, because he doesn't have one!
"I mean if we say he paid 30$ for a fee, thats ~800-900 sat/bytes and that should get him in the next block 100%. But nevertheless, yes bitcoin at its current state is a shitshow. Firstly because exchanges don't implement segwit (not the big ones, looking at you coinbase) and secondly because segwit isn't even made accessible to the ""normal"" user via GUI because core didn't program it. I don't know why we have to wait to use a feature that could change the whole dilemma. Ofcourse one could get a segwit address, but it is not supported in most exchanges or websites I use bitcoin, or rather used bitcoin."
BCH, whatever (as if the acronym they I used in my original post changes anything of value within the post.) I'm just saying, I've been lurking here for a couple months and most of the posts are about how useless BTC is. Seems like that opinion has already been put out there on this sub...and then what? What makes BCH any better than the hundreds of other coins out there? It's just endless petty bitching IMO.
Can you help me find the word “coffee” in the whitepaper?

Thanks for your input, buddy.
"Incorrect. It takes 15 seconds to broadcast a transaction to nodes. Miners can choose to include or not include any signed transactions they choose. 

Furthermore you can also rebroadcast another transaction with the same money and have a miner pick that one up instead. This would allow you to spend as much bch/btc as you want before the transaction is accepted into the chain, even if the miners aren't colluding with you.

Until the transaction is in the blockchain it isn't permanent (and for a truly secure transaction a few blocks into the blockchain). "
It has a beer on the table instead of a coffee
"I'll check it.

Why do you avoid expressing fees in USD?

The fees you paid are still unacceptably high."
"You downloaded me without understanding or comprehension, that IS rude, so don’t try to hide behind a pathetic statement like “not trying to be rude”.  Seems you may have just blurted that out without really thinking about it.

This was a 50 kB transaction, it is massive in size (not necessarily “value“), made up of hundreds of input transactions.  It will be “expensive” on any network.  $3400 USD is way too much to pay to transfer ANY amount.  $1.25 could be quite reasonable.

Please stop with the name-calling, it doesn’t belong here.

Why? When the point is to maintain decentralization? 
It is though.
Maybe so. But the way to scale is to KISS. Allow what's worked to continue until offchain is needed.

"I do think that the btc tx fees are too high. I agree that $3 is unreasonable. It is a little bit misleading though, because the value of btc right now is so high it makes the the fees high as well. Take this exact example of my transaction but from January 2017 when the price was ~$1,000, and the transaction magically only cost me 20 cents. I actually did have a transaction from around then and the tx fee was 0.00035, that's like 25 cents in january 2017 . And that transaction took...about 12 minutes. Is that a problematic tx fee or wait time? I'm not sure, I think that's probably pretty fair. If we want to use your example of the family savings of $1500, it takes ~7500 transactions to wipe them out. I think they'll be ok. 

That's the main reason I prefer to make the discussion of tx fees in the relative coin instead of converting to fiat. The *only* reason anything is 'broken' at this point is because btc exploded 15x in a 12mo period, and the tx fees haven't found a way to reduce themselves by a factor of 15 or scale with the valuation swings. If it's creating this big of problems at $15k, how on earth will it be sustainable if btc really moons and it hits something insane like 100k? That's very worrying to me looking long term, and will for sure break the coin if it's not fixed.

What I don't like is how almost every thread now in this subreddit is people making up moronic things about btc and then just chanting about bch. I think both coins at the moment are kind of crap compared to other cryptos, but I'm hopeful that btc can figure this problem out. "

"Incorrect. 

New technologies such as [LEO internet satellite constellations](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/11/spacex-plans-worldwide-satellite-internet-with-low-latency-gigabit-speed/) supplying low latency, high capacity broadband will allow a full Bitcoin Cash node anywhere on the planet. Even Tone Vays will be able to enjoy a full node in the furthermost backwater he finds himself in. 

Edit: Also, Gigabyte blocks can be enormously compressed due to all the TXs already being present in the node's mempool.
"
What do you feel is missing from the roadmap presented above?
"Basically, BCH deliberately avoided including a feature called RBF (Replace by fee). What this does is allow a user to resend a transaction with a different fee. In theory, this could be used to cheat a recipient out of their payment and thus, get something for nothing.

BCH, however, can be spent and have a very solid case of being secure prior to the next block. In theory, someone *could* set up a huge network infrastructure to fork the network and fake the payment, but this is extremely computationally impractical. If they had those resources, they'd be better off just using them to mine."
bandwidth is the issue, not processing power.  ...and that will not scale at the same rate as transaction growth.
"That's cool, but all of these are things being discussed in the crypto community at large - they are not really BCH specific.

My point is only that block size is just one aspect of scaling, and we are a long way off from fixing scalability issue in general."
I don't know what that is
I've read up on it
Bcash is an altcoin btw. chanting that bch is the 'real' btc over and over doesn't make it so. 
"Centralizing force, to a point. Keeping in line with Moore's law like advancements is not going to be a centralizing force. If scaling greatly exceeds technical advancements, then yes.

It's going to be quite a while before I would worry though. 256 megs used to be a large USB key. Now 256 Gigs is a large USB key.

1 meg every 10 minutes is *so* far from hitting a technical limit, it's absurd to draw the line there. BCH block size currently has no meaningful centralization forces."
wrong.  inc the limit will cause worldwide adoption by every citizen on the planet.  what are gvts in the end?:  just an accumulation of those very same citizens.
When we need gigabyte blocks the stores will have $5, raspberry PI XXIVs with 500 cores making the block validation the same time as stores of today validating 8MB blocks.
[Subchains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CFwy_DC1OQ) is the current proposal being discussed that will allow faster assurance of payment.  There are many other changes on the [roadmap for BCH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0rplj8wSR4) that will allow for 1G or even 1T scaling.  This includes node synchronization, UTXO management, and other aspects of the software and protocol.

My point is that removing the blocksize limit is a centralising force. Do you want Bitcoin Cash banks? Because that's how you get Bitcoin Cash banks.
gigabyte blocks still do not reduce confirmation time to anything that can be used in a store.

"Actually compute power and storage in consumer grade systems is more than enough to handle massive blocks, enough to meet demand for *many* years to come (at which point the technology will have advanced once more). There is a slight issue with bandwidth for many users on domestic adsl lines, but much of the world has access to fibre now. Graphene can fix propagation delays etc. Are you new to this debate?

As for your last question, any scaleability solution found to work on core (lightning, Schnorr sigs etc) can be adopted for cash too. Point is, no need for high fees and slow confirmations today at all. Unless you have a motive to push alternative solutions for profit of course..."
Why are you running a node in a rural area? If you want to run your own node then rent a server somewhere where bandwidth is better.
By the time we have 555 MB blocks, we will have cheap exabyte drives. Second layer solutions aren't needed.
"> even ISP bandwidth in rural areas couldn’t sustain that. 

Today's couldn't, but why do we need people in rural areas across the world running full nodes in the first place? This is what Bitcoin's creator said about network configuration:

> Long before the network gets anywhere near as large as that, it would be safe for users to use Simplified Payment Verification (section 8) to check for double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or about 12KB per day. Only people trying to create new coins would need to run network nodes. At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to specialists with server farms of specialized hardware. A server farm would
only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with that one node. -- **Satoshi Nakamoto**

EDIT: Also from the same email:

> **The bandwidth might not be as prohibitive as you think.** A typical transaction would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact). Each transaction has to be broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction. Visa processed 37 billion transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day. That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or
2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices. **If the network were to get that big, it would take several years, and by then, sending 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a big deal.**"
You have to keep in mind 555 MB blocks won't happen anytime soon. We will scale blocks as long as needed or until viable second layer solutions are fully adopted. Meanwhile Moore's law will continue. Also, we don't need individual users to run full nodes.

"I looked through several pages of bch transactions from blocks mined today and most of them had tx fees between .00001bch and .0004bch. I don't doubt you at all, but it looks like most bch transactions will have a small fee. I could be wrong though, so please feel free to correct or point somewhere that says otherwise. 

I'm not sure it's a banker thing about adding tx fees. Blocks used to be easy to mine, and more btc as a reward were available at every block. Now it's the opposite. And soon, it'll be zero. How would you propose that transactions are verified when there is zero mining reward, zero transaction fees, and miners can otherwise switch to mining other coins for either fees or rewards? Even with massive block sizes, there would have to be tx fees eventually I think. Maybe they got here earlier than anyone guessed because the blocks are all full, but they were always coming."
"> You broadcast a BCH transaction via the nodes and it gets to a miner in under a minute. It is added to the next block without fail. The process you're describing is BTC not BCH.

That's how it works right now but there is no technical reason stopping miners from refusing a transaction or even choosing to include 0 transactions in a block. Rebroadcasting is also still a problem with bch.  "

"If you understand the incentive design of the Bitcoin protocol, this is not a problem.  Miners would damage the reputation of the coin(s) causing a loss of value, which means they won't be able to pay their bills.

All for a double-spend?  Because that is the only thing they could do.  All transactions unwound would be back in the mempool and would get confirmations once again.

The rest is all conspiracy bullshit that has no basis in reality."
What percentage of the transaction was that? $90 isn't much for a $10000 transaction
"There were soft limits miners used for many years until we hit the hard 1Mb limit.  [Here is an article](https://medium.com/@peter_r/on-the-emerging-consensus-regarding-bitcoins-block-size-limit-insights-from-my-visit-with-2348878a16d8) that was published by Peter Rizun, of BU, regarding fully configurable block sizes.  The included graph shows where the soft limits were being hit before miners would increase the limit.

Basically, the miners don't want to create blocks that other miners won't accept and validate.  They are conservative with the scaling.

Bitcoin Cash has the 8Mb limit and we're moving the hard limit to 32Mb in the hardfork scheduled for May 15.  There is much discussion on if a hard limit is even necessary at all.

edit: fixed the link"
Core blocks actually did grow for like 8 years. There was a temporary 1mb cap that was put there to prevent excess spam that Satoshi stated should be increased if blocks ever became near full. So no, the spam cap was never increased because there was literally no need to do so at the time, but block sizes did grow every single year until it reached the temporary spam cap. 
"> Does BCH have a solution other than increasing the block size, i.e. a proper solution?

A proper solution is one that works. LN doesn't work, segwit also doesn't work. Maybe one day LN will work but at the moment it isn't. Since raising the blocksize works whereas LN does not, I will repeat the same question back at you. Does core have a solution that works, ie a proper solution?"

Anything to suggest it will EVER change in the future?  No.

BTC has blown itself up because of a problem that has never occurred, but might occur in the future to the detriment of miners.

Rebroadcasting is NOT a problem with BCH right now.  I hit send and a minute later, I see on the receiving wallet that my funds are coming - this means that a mining node has registered receipt of the transaction and it will be in his next block.

I really do get a kick out of everyone splitting hairs here.  The chance of your BCH transaction getting double spent after you show it incoming to your wallet is so infinitesimally small as to be comical.  Now, compare to the average 1% charge-back for Visa and Mastercard."
No. Greg and Luke for years complained incessantly about not getting paid to maintain core dev.

"It changes how the block size is calculated, so more transactions can be fit, the change makes it equivalent to increasing block size to about 1.8MB.

It also fixed malleabillity which would be an issue with lightning network.

The catch is that to get the first benefit, both parties need to use segwit addresses.

The second requires lightning network which is not ready yet."

It really shouldn't
Why not?
You've been bamboozled!
I disagree. There several reasons that crashing the network could be good for miners. Temporary FUD leads to the price crashing, miners involved buy up coins, network goes back up. At the end of it you would have vers and others claiming it was just a hiccup in the system. 
"I have no idea what means....

I said it doesn't take $28 and all day to do a transaction. 

Is that not true?

Also. 1 input and 1 output is $11"
"This is a thread about a grossly exaggerated joke about someone trying to purchase a cup of coffee that took $28 in tx fees and had to wait overnight to confirm and receive their coffee. I countered this by saying 'not really accurate, my last one took 7 minutes and the fee was ~$3'. And you roll in with another purposefully exaggerated example of a large transaction with a $1.25 fee in bcash that would have taken $3k in btc. 

You're right, that's a problem that a btc transaction, regardless of how many inputs, could have that high of fees. But that's not really what we're talking about is it? Your example is a transaction that's completely different to someone using a software wallet on their phone to buy a cup of coffee, isn't it? That's why I was being rude and snarky because you're going out of your way to highlight an unusual and extreme example when I'm trying to tell people that this whole thread is full of exaggeration. "
Use a $ amount then if you prefer, it won't bother me at all. So the avg tx fees were $3-$7.50. Mine was a ~$3 fee on a ~$250 transaction. I don't think that's super unreasonable that the miners charge that. If I want penny or fractions of a penny or zero tx fees, I have other currencies that do that for me as well. 
"The mining reward cuts in half every 4 years.  It started at 50 coins per block and cut twice to the current value of 12.5 coins.  This is intended to offset miner expenses until the transaction volumes grow to replace the reward.

The cutting in half will go to zero in the year 2140.  The expectation is that a higher number of transactions paying a very small (1-cent) fee will be sufficient to reward the miners.

The current 'fee market' is celebrated by Blockstream while it pushes users and use-cases away from BTC.  The BCH fork plans to never have such a fee market.  Ever."
Ahahahaha, that's a good one! 
HashCash. I'm stealing this.
No, because the ultimate goal is to move to adaptive block sizes or remove the limit altogether. 
"If you were interested and technical enough to understand, you would already have found the references to planned technical solutions and progress made to date.  

As to the idiots, the people doing the ""fee market"" were warned the results of their ""fee market"" and are celebrating what they achieved with champagne. They are either idiots, fools, or corrupt bad guys trying to destroy BTC.  This is obvious to anyone with a rudimentary understanding of computer networking and computer systems performance, queuing theory, and economics."
Many people here believe judging by the repeated poor decisions made by Core, (myself included) that a big part of the reason BTC can't succeed is due to its leadership.
I think it was 7 btc.
Yes, they are constraining the one-lane highway. Then they want to build a multi-lane toll road next to it. But you still have to use the single lane road to get on and off the toll road.
The reason for bitcoin's slowness and high fees are not a result of bitcoin's size and it is **intentional**. Bitcoin developers want to keep fees high so that once the miner rewards run out and there are no more bitcoins being produced, mining will still be profitable. If you want a currency with low fees and fast transactions, use bitcoin cash
"> a fuck festival of bad decisions

That sums it up nicely.  "
No, it isn't that slow. I have been doing multiple BTC transactions over the last month. Every one of them was confirmed with 6 network confirmations within 2 hours.
It is not slow if the fee is high enough.  The trick is if people submit many transactions with fees higher than yours after you submit yours, your transaction will have to wait for them to clear.  When fees rise for hours (or days), yours may be stuck for a while.  
"why does it take so long? I don't know a lot about the inner workings of merchant processors, but it seems like it is pretty 'quick' for regular electronic transactions.

How is the process technically different with bitcoins as the currency, over , say VISA credit cards or EBT or even EWIC?"
People buy stuff with Bitcoin? I thought it was just buy-and-hodl. It's far to valuable to waste in buying stuff.
it's the same speed as BCH actually (20 minute blocks) but with BCH you can be quite certain you get into next block. however in real world when you make such small purchases the transaction is instantly broadcasted to the network and you can walk away with your coffee immediately because the seller can have great confidence it will go through when the fee was reasonable - and loosing 1 coffee in 100 is not a big deal. btw, ETH average transaction price is 3 dollars currently so it is not really any different to bitcoin in this regard - it is useless whether you pay 100% fee for coffee or a 1000% fee - you just don't use the system.
Why is there TRON? It don't work at this moment, it is only a white paper. Oh. I understand he must have invited Ethereum
What's the P?
Anyone know of an exchange that trades BCH pairs?
"It is and bch is at least 90% as bad with security issues to boot. This sub is dedicated to shilling for bch and shilling against btc. That's why they call it legacy btc.

Your transaction would need to be massive for $40 to take hours 
Now if only the vendor supports LN the transaction and sale would be in mill i seconds
I would change it so that it costs $1000 because the customer has to open a tab, and that's the minimum tab balance.  Then, it will take several hours and a massive fee to open the tab.  Then, after several days the customer can come back and buy their coffee.

What a waste of time posts like this are
Newbies won’t know the difference that is why I see no winner in this situation. 
I used to use a Bitcoin-only cafe. This is probably how it is there right now.
I have a theory: that the high transaction fees are permanent so that when the number of bitcoins reaches it's ceiling, there will be a large pool of decentralized miners that will continue without the bounty of receiving Bitcoin from mining.
Not necessarily, and the fact that Bitcoin even requires waiting for a block because core downgraded it with replace by fee is a distinct disadvantage also worth pointing out.

Oh! Is there a tutorial on this anywhere? I just got my ledger but haven't set it up.
Trezor has similar issues with their hardware. Their solution is to charge 20 euros per device surcharge (on top of normal shipping charges) for immediate shipping, or you can place an order and wait until February for shipping. 
Follow the setup instructions on the Ledger site.  Once you are set, transfer some small amount from your online account to your Ledger.  Confirm the amount shows on your Ledger wallet app for the appropriate coin you transferred, then look up the instructions to wipe your device (I think they can be found on the Ledger site as well), and then recover.  I found all the instructions relatively easily.
The idea is that they won’t know what they are - and they’re in a sealed self-addressed envelope that gets stored in a safe or filing cabinet.  My point is that there are ways to enable redundant storage of such essential resources (keys/seeds). 
The same applies to addresses, right? What if I generate a random ETH address, and it just so happens to already be someone else's address?

"**Infinite monkey theorem**

The infinite monkey theorem states that a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for an infinite amount of time will almost surely type a given text, such as the complete works of William Shakespeare. In fact the monkey would almost surely type every possible finite text an infinite number of times. However, the probability that monkeys filling the observable universe would type a complete work such as Shakespeare's Hamlet is so tiny that the chance of it occurring during a period of time hundreds of thousands of orders of magnitude longer than the age of the universe is extremely low (but technically not zero).

In this context, ""almost surely"" is a mathematical term with a precise meaning, and the ""monkey"" is not an actual monkey, but a metaphor for an abstract device that produces an endless random sequence of letters and symbols.

"It's not ethical to hope people lose money. If Ripple crashes, a lot of good people are going to lose money and the fallout will be catastrophic for mental health and families around the world. Ripple has become the ""villain"" of the crypto world and the narrative keeps going on, whereas more focus should be put in supporting ""real"" cryptos then trying to tear Ripple down. Ripple, despite popular belief, will not kill other cryptos. It is not a villain and should be allowed to grow or decrease as organically as it can without all the intentional FUD.

Let's face it. In this market we vote with our speculation. And our speculation is what drives this market, since blockchain is all about putting the power back in the hands of the people. It's up to the crypto community how they want to use that power, and I know for damn sure I'm not comfortable using it to try and tear down an investment people have just because it doesn't fit my ethics of 'what ought to be'.

Again, families invested in XRP will lose money, not just the business. "

"You won't have an ""opt out"" option when all your Bitcoin investment money is still coming from money that's being wired to your damn bank account because you live in the real world and have a JOB.

As you already know there are a few of those around too.
The truth is that most XRP owners are long Bitcoin as well.  Let’s be realistic here.  Most of us judge the success of certain crypto coins by how valuable it is based on USD, KRW, YEN, or other monetary values.  In fact, most of us get excited when the value of Bitcoin in USD terms goes up and the shout of “to the moon” is heard.  So, when the most of the members shout “To the moon” or other memes, you need to realize that you are basing the success of Bitcoin or XRP to USD terms.  USD, by the way, is printed and issued by the Federal Reserve, which is anything but federal, but that topic is another issue.   So, rather than talking about some crypto coin science project of attempting to build a wonderful world where Bitcoin replaces the entire banking system, the reality is we like Bitcoin because it brings us a lot of USD into our pockets.  So, rather than being obtuse and point fingers to certain coins for being “centralized” or less centralized, how about we become honest with ourselves and think about how we can make money through speculating on Bitcoin and other crypto currencies.  Also, if you think those vendors currently accepting Bitcoin are doing it to replace our banking system, my friend, you are beyond delusional.

"So I'll attempt a reasoned argument and suggest we leave out all the emotive comments on Blockstream, Satoshi' s true vision, Core's motives. Etc.

8MB blocks won't ever lead to a global low cost payment system. It's maths.

In order to allow 7 billion people (world's population) to make 2 transactions a day, you would need 24GB Blocks. This assumes 250 bytes/tx.

Now, Bitcoin Cash could keep increasing the block size as adoption increases but that's generally acknowledged to create centralisation in nodes and mining.

So what do you disagree with? The first (8MB is insufficient for mass adoption) or the latter (we cannot keep increasing block size)?"
The cash address format doesn't go well with this narrative.

"> So what do you disagree with? The first (8MB is insufficient for mass adoption) or the latter (we cannot keep increasing block size)?

Neither actually; what I disagree with are your premises. Allow me to explain:

> In order to allow 7 billion people (world's population) to make 2 transactions a day, you would need 24GB Blocks. This assumes 250 bytes/tx.

Here, you're making three fatal assumptions:

*  The first one is that bitcoin will ever become a single global payment network seeking to replace all currencies and forms of money transfer. This **may** come to pass, but from a realistic PoV it's highly, highly unlikely. I could go into the reasons for why if you desire, but I hope this notion is pretty self-explanatory.

* The second assumption is that, even if we were to assume that 1) will come true (and again, it's huge-honking *if*), that it will happen within the next 20 years, a time when technology (processing speed, network storage, and bandwidth) could be somewhat cautiously be argued to not necessarily being able to handle 24GB blocks. Bitcoin has grown inmensely in the last 9 years, but even if we assumed a continued exponential adoption rate (something that hasn't held true in the last couple of years); bitcoin would still fall waaaaaaaaay short from getting to the point of ""global financial network substituting every currency"". But 20 years down the road? All bets are fucking off. even 15 years ago nobody could foresee there being cheap, commonly avaiblable gigabit FTTH, and that's exactly the kind of connection I'm writing to you from. Moore's Law might not be an actual ""law"", but it sure as hell has been exceeded in all 3 commonly argued ""blottlenecks"" for bitcoin.

* The third fatal assumption is that, even if 1) and 2) were true (should we attempt to calculate the odds of this happening?) the bitcoin protocol will remain unchanged, and the same bottlenecks we're seeing today will remain so 20 years from now (or whenever assumption 1) is supposed to be achieved). This is also quite absurd, even in the stagnated ""immutable protocol"" legacy bitcoin, as I'm sure you're aware. 

> but that's generally acknowledged to create centralisation in nodes and mining.

This is something else that you're taking for granted, and it also includes the assumption that an ""uncensorable"" network topology must include some significant percentage of bitcoin users as ""full (non-mining) nodes"". This latter assumption is a huge one, and I haven't seen evidence to support it. I know you said you don't like Arguments From Satoshi (authority), but given that he designed the network layout, the very layout we're still using today, I hope you can forgive if I mention that the ""invention"" of ""full (non mining) nodes"" isn't something Satoshi designed. SPV wallets don't truly represent an adversarial increase in risk as compared to ""full (non-mining) nodes"", and a topology of miners (full nodes) - SPV nodes is exactly how the network was designed to run. The first assumption, that that ""it's generally acknowledged that increasing the blocksize increases centralisation"" isn't exactly untrue, but what little evidence we have doesn't really support that notion that it happens in any significant manner at blocksizes below several hundreds of MB, with today's hardware and protocol. But hey, I'm nothing if not open minded, so I'll gladly review evidence if you want to present it to me.

As a more general design philosophy for bitcoin, the real discrepancy between BTC and BCH is this notion of ""finding a natural technological limit for scalability when and **if** it is ever reached"", vs ""let's keep the limit artificially restricted to absurdly-low levels at the expense of literally everything else, and creating post-hoc rationalisations for it that might even be innerly-inconsistent""; and the latter is just a philosophy I can simply never get behind, precisely when we're talking about trying to create a universally accesible, censorship-resistant, peer-to-´peer electronic cash payment network. I just can't. I no longer complain about the BTC Core Devs seeking to do things in such a way because we finally have our fork where we can see our vision realised; so in general terms, and while I might enjoy debating the absurdity of the small-blocker mindset, I just couldn't care less what BTC does anymore. 

But I do think it's important to point out that the small-blocker argument (and to a T what you've laid out in this comment), can be boiled down to a slippery-slope fallacy. 

I do think we may eventually find a natural technological limit to Bitcoin scalability; but given that I don't know where its natural adoption curve will end up, or what market niche it'll end up occupying (I hope right now you agree that both BTC and BCH's value consist of > 99.99999% speculation), I'm not at all of the opinion that we should be artificially cornered into this or that, especially if it means restricting its natural adoption when we're orders of magnitude from reaching even **today's** natural technological scalability limits."

So yes, if Bitcoin is a name, like 'London', I can put it all over whatever I want.  But Bitcoin is an idea, and only the the thing that follows that idea should be called Bitcoin.  I cannot pull up a dollar bill and declare it to be Bitcoin, can I? That is basically what Core has done."

"Everything Crypto could tank tomorrow and I will be fine.  You never put in to any of this, any more than you could lose.  I have been around awhile.

It did occur to us, which is why most of us try to stop BTC from going down the path that a couple of developers forced it.  Mind you, the Big Financial Firms are most likely to blame for the path that it took.  The best way to destroy your enemy, is to infiltrate your enemy and change it from the inside.  Because of BTC, a bunch of miners gave up on it and hedge big time in other coins.  BTC is on life support, mainly because of what you speak of.  But kill it slowly, grind it down and maybe all of the crypto world won't collapse at once.

Or, do what we did, fix Bitcoin with a smart plan, remove the malware and non-features, work to restore Bitcoin back to what it was and hope we can supplant enough of the BTC economy before it implodes.  BCH is the real Bitcoin.  BTC is something else, it is sad that that cripple coin is killing the Bitcoin name, but hopefully from its ashes, crypto can be reborn, more indestructible than before."

Kind of deceptive, especially considering ""Bitcoin Legacy"" sounds like it's just a new fork.

The subject of this post is one example. Bitcoin.com is another. 
Yeah, there are a massive group of people who still aren't aware bitcoin is broken and heading toward failure.  I run into them daily in real life, and when they ask me about the situation, I have no choice but to tell them to avoid bitcoin and stick to usable cryptocurrencies instead (especially the ones who want to accept crypto as payment, like a real currency.)  The more this goes on with word of mouth, the lower bitcoin will be.
"Big money props up BTC with the intention of siphoning funds from small money. So this ""market"" you speak of like it's all mighty is quite figuratively bankers taking candy from babies. Unless Bitcoin does a 180, sooner than later no small money will be using bitcoin, and the big money no longer has willing contributors to their slush fund, they all try to leave, bitcoin crashes. So there's your almighty market for you. Disclaimer: It wasn't like this until Core intentionally broke Bitcoin."
"And I do not think you understand how cryptocurrency as a technology and ethos works, or what I'm trying to say.

I also don't think you understand how early adoption works, or how the long tail works, or what I'm trying to tell you and warn you about that a lot of mass of early adopters and, y'know, the people who were into it way before you were have long since cashed out and left BTC and won't touch it with a 50 foot pole.

We're all sitting over here watching it and waiting for the inevitable bottom to fall out, for Tether to collapse and for the bottom to fall out of the rest of the market.

Which means you don't actually know how the market works, either, even though you think you do - when you're really just tunnel-vision focused on speculative and/or increasing value.

That's a fine mindset for a trader, but you might as well be trading soybean futures or silver. That has nothing to do with cryptocurrency as an evolving technology, who is using it and where that value is coming from.

Cash market valuation is only one metric of value. And the trading/spec market is not actually the primary function of any of these cryptocurrencies. People have just turned it into that, and they might as well be trading tulip bulbs if they're not deploying or using the technology in the real world.

Seriously, some folks might as well be trading memes.

And some people care a lot more about actually being able to use a given blockchain or network than they are about what the arbitrary price of the coin in a given fiat if they're using that particular chain as a secure transmission conduit.

Yes, that might sound crazy to you but some people aren't actually interested in cryptocurrencies because they want to get rich, speculate or even hodl. That simplified hodl mentality is for scared, gullible sheep.

Simply ""hodling"" in the cult like way /r/bitcoin has promoted is what people tell you when the want to make money off of your gullibility. This has never not been true in trading, be it forex, commodities or listed blue chip stocks.

Because what some of us really care about is moving some value through the network in exchange for something else. If it's fiat going in and fiat going out at either end as fast as possible, they don't care what the value of the coin itself is.

They just care that the network is secure, fast and a low fee and that what goes in one end comes out the other side in some usable form.

Or that they're able to quickly and securely buy, say, a cup of fucking coffee.

If you think cash market value is the only real measurement or metric of a coin, you really don't understand cryptocurrency or blockchains at all.

This is a very, very simplistic and limited view to hold. It's emotional tunnel vision.

Sources: Involved in and interested in cryptocurrencies since 2009. Interested in cryptography since the early 90s.

I used to play with scripted forex and commodities back in the mid 90s when stale 15 minute old market data could still cost you a few grand USD a month, plus satellite data terminal leasing fees.

The hype around bitcoin and crypto isn't new to me.

So, maybe put aside what you think you know and think about the fact I'm trying to offer you a warning and tell you something:

BTC is in a bubble. BTC is vulnerable to Tether pegging. Most coins are overinflated in value due to hype and fresh blood, but BTC is especially hyped. Right now, most of the major coins follow BTCs USD value lead.

None of this is an indication of a healthy, functional, liquid or diversified market. The market is very, very brittle right now.

And you're and everyone else is a goddamn fool if you don't think that those chickens aren't coming home to roost for BTC and the fools trying to prop it up.

So yeah, buy in now near the trembling, wavering ATH. Ignore all those other shitcoins! Just hodl! It'll moon eventually, right?

Right? Guys? Hey, where'd everyone go?"
I've already been explaining the situation to people for 3 months now, back when I realized BCH was the real bitcoin.
"So Bitcoin as of block 478557 no longer exists

there are now two primary forks of it

one has forked Bitcoin to add Segwit (block 478,558)

one has forked Bitcoin to raise block size (block 481,824)

there were some other forks too but those didn't amount to much I think we can both agree"
"By definition of the word fork, both chains should be considered forks.

Fork, n.: *One of the parts into which anything is furcated or divided*"
"Look, we can have differences in opinion, but we should stay strictly factual. 

Fact: 

The first block in the Bitcoin Cash blockchain is the genesis block, mined by Satoshi Nakamoto on January 3rd, 2009. "
Tell me. Did humans fork off of gorillas or did gorillas fork off of humans?
"Why so angry?  Why an emotional response to something you claim to be all about logic and reasoning? Why no response to logic and reason?  

You still do not get the difference between a company and Bitcoin? Sad."
"You could, but that doesn't mean anyone would see value in that fork, use it at all, or hold the coins. 

Plus, you would need some hash power for that to survive. $$"
How does it fit the definition of having the most accumulated PoW? Wasn't that what we were talking about? 
Currently hodlin BCH in Bitfinex right now :D
"Again. Since you don't seem to be able to get beyond your own view of the issue.

The market currently favour's BTC. Favour may be going up, or down, or sideways. Doesn't change that the market currently favours BTC."
"I do not think you understand how the market works. The market votes with their money. The market currently believes BTC is worth 6x more than BCH. You can talk around it all you like, it doesn't change the numbers.

You can say it is headed towards a dead end and all that. But until the market values BCH more than BTC, the market disagrees with you. This is how the market functions. It's pretty basic."
[deleted]
"> I don't see a definition of can or can't fork in the above sentence.

That's exactly the point, you claim one can somehow ""change the consensus rules with a fork"". Such a thing was never part of the definition, this ten year old whitepaper you're so eager to quote.

However, what actually *is* in the whitepaper is the ""most work defines the valid chain"" rule, which bcash completely does away with, since obviously there exists a valid chain, that has much more accumulated difficulty than bcash has.

So obviously your ""we respect the original vision"" thing only applies when it's convenient for you, pretty selective reading you have here.

> Interesting point of view.

It's not really a ""point of view"" ANYONECANSPEND transactions are striclty valid from a protocol point of view, and do not require a signature. Whether someone decides to use fractions of Bitcoins to track rare pepes as smart property and adds context dependent rules to their use, has no bearing on Bitcoin itself.

> Even the chain pre 01.08.2017 would fail.

Which block precisely?"
A soft fork yes, not sure about the block
"Nothing happened to the original blockchain at August 1st... 

All Bitcoin nodes continued working like nothing happened, and they are still valid today, working on the ORIGINAL blockchain, BTC.

On that date, a new blockchain, with replay protection implemented (like any forked alt coin), was created and become invalid to the original nodes already running, creating the BCH blockchain."
"How fucking brainwashed are you? I'm gonna highlight my post again because now you've changed the subject ""when you copy something and claim it's the original and you try to sell it as being the original it's called scamming, google it"". The subject here is passing something that's a copy for the real thing, it's not about the fees. By your logic I can say that ""Nikes are too expensive and the customer service is shit, therefore if I register my company as Nike Fresh and claim it's better and cheaper I can put Nike out of business once everyone else starts calling me Nike and the original Nike Nike Legacy because I pay them too"" xD Are you just braindead or a paid shill?"
We can fork Bitcoin Cash in a year, give holders free coins then refer to it as legacy after even when it's still running.
We need some Korean investors, to shake hands with coinbase and tv stations behind the scenes then some big mining teams that want good profits but it should be possible. The plan is when it happens what we can do is have coinbase block sales of our fork during the channels hype and get the community to talk about a flip causing panic sells of bch while we make lots of bch micro transactions slowing it down and this should cause a nice pump in value rising it up the market cap charts.
"In practice it isn't...

If I want to fork from (and the keyword here is *from*) Bitcoin Cash tomorrow, I have the same right to call my alt coin ""Bitcoin Cash"" than the BCH blockchain that had nothing to do with the fork? Even if it would be my forked blockchain that would be invalid for BCH nodes?"

*no point in arguing with someone who pulls shit like this, I just pulled your own shit on you, changing the subject and ignoring your points, I get that it's difficult to argue pro for a scam but you should at least recognize that your own technique worked wonders on you :) you got pretty worked up there"
People bet with their $ not their number of addresses. You're discussing indicators within the market. Not how the current market actually is.
"I am not angry, I just realized that you are tiny and so ignorant.  And if you can point me to the emotional part, I would like to know.  Racist and sexist are intellectually inferior and emotionally stunted.  I guess, that might be why you want to claim that was an emotional response.  Someday, you might learn that humans are emotional beings and the logic is an afterthought.  Of course, your insecurity and fragility, makes you create beliefs about how A is better than B, and A is you, but you are not A and A is not superior to B.

But back on topic. Bitcoin is an idea and people who do not get that, do not get Bitcoin and yes, they believe it to be a name, because they do not know any better.  In your case, at least, that is likely because they lack the mental capabilities to conceive of what Bitcoin is, so they latch on to it, as a name, because that is all they can understand.  Further, they also create up claims of confusion by the naming of things, because, I assume, they are confused by them.  Of course you are emotionally invested in it all, as you are incapable of intellectually understanding any of it.  You appreciate that someone has spoon fed you little tidbits to get angry about, because you can not handle the larger, deeper topics and concepts.

I do not think crypto is for you.  You seem too easily confused and angry about it all.  Even your last response, I would expect in a COD game with 12 year olds, not in a serious discussion about the idea of Bitcoin."
Considering BTC legacy address creation is going down, and BCH address creation is skyrocketing, I would say people actually favor BCH, but if you use **only** the price of one coin it sure does skew things.
"> Why so angry? Why an emotional response to something you claim to be all about logic and reasoning? Why no response to logic and reason?

Oh shiet did I just use your own arguing tactic against you successfully? Holy shit I'm good :D *patting myself on the back"
That doesn't change that the current market favours BTC. It is simple numbers. You can throw in your opinions or feelings all you like. But the current market favours BTC.
"Sexist and dumb on top of it.  This is why your are where you are and cannot understand very simple concepts.  Explains a lot.

I did not make it about fees, I gave examples of Logic and Reason, so you could maybe, miraculously, pull something out of your ass that resembled it, since, clearly, your head is too empty to pull anything useful from.

So you go from name calling to stupidity and then say I am the one throwing random insults at you.  Please come back with more gibberish.  Might as well throw in some Racism, to suit the rest of your gross ignorance.  Red Pilling are you? Makes sense.

"Fact: Also Bitcoin Gold, and all other alt coins forked from BTC.
Also the original blockchain that didn't forked, BTC."
And notice how much traction has been made with BCH already.  I moved most of my btc into it when it was $500, and it has gone up massively in 2 months since then... it will continue to reach parity sooner rather than later.
"Nope, that mostly sums it up.  The brand went with the Segwit fork, at least so far that seems quite clear.

I would correct you that many of the BCH developers were already devs for BTC development teams, back when it seemed like BTC would have decentralized protocol development.  As you point out, that is no longer really the case: the Bitcoin protocol is the work product of one central team (Bitcoin Core) and has been all along, and they make no effort to be inclusive to other teams, but instead are openly hostile to competition.

I think decentralizing the administration of the protocol is arguably the most significant long term structural advantage BCH has vs BTC and frankly most other altcoins too but that will take time to play out."
"If the chain that hard forked loses the claim to the name Bitcoin than Bitcoin Core has lost that claim years ago when it hard forked.

Fact is that hard forks are a feature of Bitcoin which has been done in the past (before 01.08.2017) and the fork had not nullified the claim to the name Bitcoin.

Bitcoin Gold and all the other forks have a claim to the name but it is disputable because they deviate from the whitepaper (because they all have SegWit)."
"There are many forks of Bitcoin.

Only one is the Bitcoin described in the white paper though. It's not Bitcoin Diamond, Bitcoin Gold, or even Bitcoin Core at this point. 

The one described in the white paper is Bitcoin Cash. "
What logic and reason? You've just changed the subject to fees xD Are you female? because that's how girls argue, when they don't like the points that you're making because it makes them feel bad they start changing the subject or throw random insults at you. 
"That may be. But that doesn't change the fact, that as of now, the market favours BTC 6:1 

The market valuation is literally just the collective views of everyone involved who have ""voted"" with their money. Just like in a stock market."
"Okay. You can continue to go on with your personal opinions on BTC vs BCH.

But the market is a collective group conscious where the people involved ""vote"" on what they believe in with their money. Same as the stock market.

You can try to type walls of text to try to get around the fundamentals of what a market it. It won't change what the market fundamentally is. And the market supports BTC 6:1 to BCH."

"I guess there was a soft fork (BTC, ""Bitcoin"") which remained the chain with the most accumulated difficulty, retained the same ticker, same developer team and same wallet support that existed prior to August. This coin has the largest market cap and the most network activity. Most people call this Bitcoin.

There was a hard fork (BCH, ""Bitcoin Cash"") which resulted in a coin with new ticker, new developer team and new wallet support.

Correct me where i'm wrong. I have nothing against Bitcoin Cash or its supporters. We disagree on scaling solutions but that disagreemelt is great and welcomed in decentralised systems."
Bitcoin cash *is* bitcoin.  It's the same chain, genesis block, and data structures that were used for many years prior to blockstream taking over.  And it matches the whitepaper more closely, so yeah it should be called bitcoin cash.
"You have no logic or common sense man.  You are not using any of it here, anyway.  Or maybe you can try and show me where you did.

Logic = High fees are the sign of a broken system

Reason = LN has been in development for years and promises more than it can deliver.

Logic = Big blocks are the path to scaling for the near future, like a couple decades.

Reason = Bitcoin is a chain of signatures that have not been segregated."
Clearly? People have different interpretations of what is the real bitcoin. I welcome the debate. Is it the coin that is removing signatures or the coin that has removed the block size limit. Both are changes. 
"The market is Bitfinex and Tether. Until they get away with it, the price of whatever is most convenient to them will rise.

The real market is dumping BTC fast. Faster now than Bitfinex can pump it - and at some point it becomes uneconomical to pump the cadaver of the (un)dead horse, and they transition to pumping BCH (which would be bad), or go down with BTC (also bad).

Good outcomes only follow the great Tether crash of the future.

The market... lol."
Money changes people. He has received thousands of BTC in donations to 'improve' his forum. The forum still looks the same so I wouldn't be surprised if he is filthy rich right now.
"+1 for a very thorough response.

While I do disagree with you taking issue with the 7 billion figure (it's illustrative that eventually a large block size is required if all transactions are on change - feel free to take a fraction of it) and the rate of adoption  (I don't think mass adoption will take 20 years) you clearly have a researched and considered view.

I'm not against increasing blocks but I do envisage a secure, global, low fee and fast currency with mass adoption. Call me naive but Bitcoin with Lightning is better suited to this than Bitcoin Cash (without segwit).

Inevitably we no doubt disagree here. Ultimately the future will prove who is right or wrong."
How is this a trojan horse?
Simply works.  Bitcoin Cash.
If Litecoin advocates had there way they would call it Litecoin because it's wasn't Bitcoin in the first place it was a fork.
bitcoin is bitcoin.  bitcoin cash is bitcoin cash.  it is never going to be different.  but i do enjoy watching the insanity play out on this subreddit.  you're the flat-earth community of crypto.
"I hear you - both our interpretations could explain Bitcoin Cash advocates using Bitcoin.Com and the Bitcoin Twitter 

Although I don't think your interpretation is consistent with the fact that  Bitcoin Cash advocates use the BTC sub reddit. There is no ambiguity with the ticker code.

Logically, I consider the theory that is consistent most often, more likely true."
Um, that's not how forks work. 
"Except when the market is only framing that price in fiat. Which means they're really only interested in speculation, hodling and eventually dumping.

One prime value of a functioning crypto system is that you should be able to put any value of fiat (or anything else) in one side and it comes out roughly the same value on the other, even if you switching between different fiat currencies.

The real goal for a lot of people in this space isn't to get rich through speculation and dumping, but to build or support new economic systems that actually work.

Chasing coins down the fiat rabbit hole only strengthens fiat."
"Forking is a feature of Bitcoin it does not mean that the forked chain has no claim to the Bitcoin name.  
If that was the case than Bitcoin Core would have lost the claim a long time ago when it hard forked.



By the way BTC soft fork with SegWit."
"> Bitcoin Cash (BCH) forked from Bitcoin (BTC) at Block 478558.

So? Bitcoin Segwit forked at block 481,824. What's your point again?

We can't even agree on the currency code.  Many prefer to use XBT, since it is ISO 4217 compliant.

BCH is being forked to Bitcoin Candy, so ya, go hop on that if you think it has merit.  This is a free market, you can do what you want and call it what you want.  Scammers do abound and occasionally you will find the real deal.

Bitcoin was backed by Ver's capital, too, but I guess that was OK as long as it worked for you, right?

And no, Paris would not become Paris Legacy, though some people could choose to call it that and the people who started crying over it would have the same right to complain about it, as you do about this.  Probably, the same number of people would care.  Again, you only care because you have emotionally invested yourself, in something, that right now, looks like you might be on the losing side.  So your dissonance is causing you to behave in bizarro ways.  But do not think I am angry, I got out of BTC and that makes me very happy."
"It's not as simple as that. Other metrics to look at include volume, liquidity, and even more ethereal metrics like adoption and end use.

I don't think BTC/segwit will ever completely go away because there's too many speculators chasing and pumping for fiat value.

But at this point it's pretty clear that BTC/segwit is diving head first into a functional dead end, and it's going to be replaced by other chains.

Here's another indicator: Everyone that I personally know who has been around since at least 2010, everyone I know that used to mine BTC on GPUs and even CPUs back when you still could, and everyone I know and who used to hold BTC has liquidated it in the past few months and split it all out to either BCH, ETH, ZCash or other systems, with ETH and BCH holding the bulk of their fiat value.

Oh, and everyone who I know who is actually turning a profit in casual daytrading doesn't use BTC/Segwit at all. The fees are just too high, and they've been burnt too many times on trade speed due to how slow the network is.

So, yeah, fuck BTC. Most of us don't care any more and we're just laughing. We don't care about it mooning or nose-diving into the dirt.

At this point it's basically being entirely propped up by new speculation money by people who first heard about bitcoin in the last 2-3 years, or the last 3-6 months."

Interesting point of view.  
The problem with this argument is that SegWit transactions only look like ANYONECANSPEND but they should not be regarded as such. So a signature is implied but it does not exist in the chain.

> It is not so, I'll let you guess which chain would be accepted as the valid one, should it be submitted to the Bitcoin client saint Satoshi left us.

This argument is flawed.

It's the same price differential in ETH, if you want to frame it that way. Or in lambos.

"> +1 for a very thorough response.

Well, I bothered with it only because you seemed to make at the very least honest points. I'm always up for a give-and-take.  

> Call me naive but Bitcoin with Lightning is better suited to this 

I don't think you're naive; from an obssesive comp-sci's PoV, having to secure and store every single person's transactions in your personal computer seems incredibly wasteful, and I can absolutely see that. But that's the actual desgin of bitcoin, and indeed its earth-shattering innovation. It's the unavoidable solution to the Bizantine General Problem, and something that, I'm sorry, the Lightning Network doesn't provide. Something else the LN doesn't provide: a truly decentralised (which translated to **real** censorship resistance) routing algorithm, which would be the way to achieve the segregated network topology that the original LN protocol promised it would be allowed to do. If you don't know what I'm alluding to, please ask me for more information; I tend to assume well-spoken and calm people are super-well informed about all the intricacies of the different proposals, but unfortunately if /r/bitcoin is your main source of information, you won't find information on those kinds of limitations and underdeliverance of promises that has become the LN.

Plus, don't get me wrong; I'm not **against** L2 solutions such as the LN. The LN provides a very interesting scalability option that's bound to find a certain market usage **on its own merits**: for instance, true microtransactions (and the kinds of yet-nonexistent markets that they could enable) would be the ideal usecase for the LN. But I think ""LN maximalists"" fail to understand a couple of very important points:

* As I said **it is not truly censorship resistant**. Decentralisation is not a binary value, and the LN is no doubt a more decentralised option than, say, a tipping service (such as the one that's very popular for BCH); but it is not truly, completely, permissionless and decentralised, which means it should *never* be lauded as a main-chain alternative to trnsacting in bitcoin. 

* The LN is a clunky protocol that, depite vast improvements in UI from wallets, will forever be bound to its inherent UX limitations: mainly, being ""a separate"" way to transact from ""real"" bitcoin, the fact that you have to ""lock in"" funds, etc...

* On a philosophical level (and also a practical one, but this offends me less), **artificially restricting on-chain transactions to force users onto the LN, is wrong**, misguided, and ultimately, probably also infeasible (in the sense that this ""forced fee market"" is irreducibly unstable, and cannot allow ever for predictable fees, etc, that would offer on-ramps towards LN usage, even if we chose to ignore the previous 2 points.

The only aspect about which I think you could be considered naive, is in ignoring the network effect of the infrastructure already built around bitcoin; and furthermore how businesses left and right are adopting BCH precisely because of this network effect, and how not-a-hassle-at-all it is. This will not hold true for the LN (and it's not holding true for SegWit, even, which require far fewer adaptations).

> than Bitcoin Cash (without segwit).

The funniest part of it all, and something large portions of the community have been **lied to about**, is this notion that LN can't happen without SegWit. Go ahead, ask /u/nullc about it (he never dares to respond to me as of late, and I don't think he can claim I troll or otherwise harass him); a few months ago, when SegWit didn't seem like it was going to be activated (fun fact; it was only activated due to the NY agreement which the Core devs then built a huge massive campaign against fulfilling the second tenet of it) he cheerfully went around reminding everyone that SegWit isn't really necessary for the LN; it merely makes its implementation easier. And it's true. But more than that, what makes the LN implementation easier isn't some magical property of SegWit, it's merely a fix to transaction malleability, which is something the BCH teams are studying of introducing to the protocol in a future upgrade (just not for its own sake). 

> Ultimately the future will prove who is right or wrong.

The thing about ""the future"" as an indication of anything, is that we will never get there, and it will forever remain nebulous. Things are happening as we speak: Bitcoin's Market Dominance is at an All Time Low (and falling), and BCH is quickly gaining ground. Do you not believe trends are already visible?

I have plenty of more ideas regarding what an actual Crypto-dominated-financial-world would look like, but these comments are getting absurdly long as they are."

That's not me downvoting. I'm not a shill. Just pointing out the Bitcoin Cash website also acknowledges it forked. I'm surprised that's in question really. 
"Lelel, stupid troll is a disingenuous scammer enabler pushing lies to make money for his handlers

Not even the ""official decentralized teams of bcash developers"" dare to say what you just said

Thats why you always be a poor broke bum

Enjoy your shitcoin, and ver's juice in your mouth boy"
"You can argue what you like but as noted above, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) forked at Block 478558 and it's official website acknowledged this.

Serious changes is subjective. Both BCH and BTC have made changes that people will argue are serious."
In that case BTC could be “Bitcoin IE6”. Old and slow but everything still has to be made compatible with it or people will bitch. 
"A developer's job is to produce cleanly engineered, useful and re-usable code, design, documentation.

Gavin is very good at it.

You can't fight deliberate dirty design like Blockstream's with anything except a software fork. Gavin never opposed a fork. He even did the original attempt (XT) which could have been very good for Bitcoin if it had got the support of miners. Unfortunately it was ahead of its time and miner's didn't see or believe what the future would bring. 

Gavin is, or at least was, a visionary. I'm thrilled he still devotes time to improving Bitcoin."
Only the block headers are chained. The blockchain has never contained the transactions themselves.
Facetiousness has no place in this discussion.
Ha ! So it is unavoidable that BCH will surpass BTC when the blocksize of >1 MB maintains for a long enough time.
Hey I hold some Btc and if I wasn’t so broke maybe I’d have some bcash as well, anyway WTF DOES ANY OF THIS MEAN!?!? to the regular ass mofo like me?

"""MA FEES!"" if the price DOES drop, so will the fees. What will you FUD about then?"
This seems dumb. It plays into the narrative r/bitcoin has that Bitcoin Cash supporters are trying to cause brand confusion to pump Bitcoin Cash. If Bitcoin Cash has merit, it will succeed. This just looks petty to me.
This shit just gets more embarrassing day by day.  Its like saying I like the xbox controller better but prefer calling it a playstation. ITS STILL AN XBOX

"Did I miss the link?  Still says ""Bitcoin Cash"".  When is the change over date?

Ahh... found it: https://blockexplorer.com/  Not http://bitcoincash.blockexplorer.com/"
Why would bitcoin cash need a block explorer? People actually use it? 
"I thought Bitcoin legacy was already Bitcoin legacy. So now when people start a ledger nano s they will have to pick between Bitcoin legacy legacy, Bitcoin legacy segwit, and Bitcoin cash?

Can't see how that would confuse anyone."
It's great to see the industry adopting the real Bitcoin like this.
"I like how bcash supporters are so gullible they support a coin run by a guy who lied about being Satoshi (Craig), a guy who has zero credibility and is mentally unstable (Roger), and a guy ho want child pornography legalised.

"I wonder how much bribe they had to pay for blockexplorer.com

"The funny thing is, the masses still call Bitcoin, well, Bitcoin, and people know BCH as Bitcoin Cash. If you just start calling your altcoin ""Bitcoin"", it's actually bad for your coin. So, as someone who sold my BCH long ago, I'm all for them calling Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin."
Bitcoin core and bitcoin cash. Also start making that logo green. Distinguish ourselves.
This is stupid 
"I would prefer they call it ""Bitcoin Core"". I don't like the term bitcoin legacy. There's nothing 'legacy' about the BTC chain"
This will both confuse people and is technically wrong, in the whitepaper it clearly says Bitcoin is the chain with most accumulated work.
Yes, except IMO Bitcoin Core is better than Bitcoin Legacy/Segwit
So block chain systems don't exist? Because good luck finding all the transactions done inside exchanges on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain.

"Personally, it would be better if they had a period using Bitcoin Core (or Legacy or whatever) and Bitcoin Cash. So there is no Bitcoin, only Bitcoin Core/Legacy and Bitcoin Cash, that way there is no concussion.

Then after a transition period and after Core suicide is more evident in price and in everything, they can finally drop the Cash from Bitcoin Cash and call it only Bitcoin.

Having a transition period would avoid concussion and would allow other companies to join in on the same scheme easier."

It will obviously confuse people. This type of stuff is the wrong thing to focus on and will actually make you look like con men. 
I think the confusion will be beneficial because ppl will start asking questions. Though I feel like labeling it Bitcoin Core would be more appropriate, labeling it Bitcoin Legacy feels deserved after all their slimy tactics.
How bout keep calling it Bitcoin Cash and let time tell. Total supporter of BCH but you talk about BCH will insane confidence like you can predict the future. I don’t think were at the point yet to call Bitcoin Cash Bitcoin because it isn’t. Bitcoin will always be Bitcoin. 
"How about Bitcoin heads and Bitcoin tails? Because a fork does not create a dominant and subordinate chain, a fork is specific. Bch forked to accept 8mb blocks, BTC forked to implement.ent segregated witness allowing ""replace by fee"" tramsactions and ""anyone can spend"" coins by breaking the chain of signatures. These are both attempts to address scailing. Segwit enables sidechains like the lightning network and intends to pay for the sidechains with mining fees. Bitcoin cash seeks to meet the growing  demand for transactions by increasing the main chain capacity 8x making fees 8x lower, neither of these are the legacy Bitcoin with 1mb blocks and no Segwit. The Bitcoin core fork required wallet providers to make changes and required miners to make changes as well. The exosystem trusted core and ended up pointing their users at the highest fees ever paid in the history of Bitcoin with the total fees in some blocks nearly reaching the block reward itself. Bitcoin Segwit failed and should refactor itself back into bch and redouble everyone's holding on each chain, arriving at a block chain that is Segwit backwards compatible but not forward compatible. The problem is core won't even consider the possibility because they have been bought by blockstream, which has shareholders and profit motives like all Delaware corporations do. But Bitcoin has no organization. So omeone out in the wild will have to make the Bitcoin unified block validator and release it into the wild. But that's just  my ,02 bits"
And of course /r/Bitcoin is on their negative review brigade again...
Is blockchain.info planning the same? I am into crypto currency because I believe in removing central control, inflation, and political structures from our money system, however this process shows me we've traded central bankers for central programmers. Good or bad?
Well, this is nuts.  Talk about deliberately working to confuse noobs that come into this world, let alone those of us who are more seasoned.  But the pairings with BTC will continue, eh?  Or is BTC in pairings sneakily becoming Bitcoin Cash.  All I know is I sense a bully in the room.  I hate bullies.
"Same with cryptograffiti.info

I knew this day would come and thus I didn't bother to rename BTC to BCH, and I'm just referring to bitcoins everywhere on the site just as bitcoins while meaning Bitcoin Cash. Only at the payment area there is a glowing warning that says ""Bitcoin Core is REJECTED here"""

"I'd like this to be an endpoint for this ongoing battle, but please don't do this.

It's needlessly confusing and is as bad as the numpties on the other side using ""BCash"". There are already many variant coins with different suffixes. Don't make it seem like there is another one, and don't use a different naming from that which everyone else uses. The goal is to impress people sufficiently that we're better, not to trick them into using us.

One day bitcoin core will die all on its own, then you can unambiguously drop the ""cash"" suffix. Until then, for better or for worse we're called bitcoin cash.

One day you can do this, but not this day."

"It takes courage to stand up for the truth these days, much respected! I hope they are prepared to be attacked by gmaxwell's sockuppet army and theymos' r/bitcoin sheep.

For anyone still in doubt whether Bitcoin Cash is in fact Bitcoin, one look into the whitepaper should be enough. Bitcoin Legacy, this segwit/lightning mutant, that is promoted as 'digital gold' via censorized channels, has not much in common anymore with the Bitcoin developed by Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin Cash is and has always been Bitcoin."

"> In August 2017, Bitcoin forked into two variants. These have taken radically different paths.

> Looking at the situation one quarter later, it is clear to us that the Blockstream fork of bitcoin diverges so radically from the ideas presented in the Bitcoin white paper, that it is an evolutionary dead end. While it may still have high trading value, as a mere collectible of curiosity, the Blockstream fork of bitcoin is not part of building any future financial infrastructure, which is what Block Explorer is about.
A currency of the future has subcent optional usage fees and instant transactions. The Blockstream fork of Bitcoin (""Bitcoin Legacy"") is at $20 usage fees and rising, with no end in sight, and can take days to confirm, despite unfulfilled promises to the contrary on both points when Segwit activated in what can only be described as a community fistfight. We are therefore making the decision to consider the Blockstream fork deprecated, and support it as legacy technology only.

> Rather, we have made the decision to support the only bitcoin fork with a postive utility momentum, which is Bitcoin Cash. We took an early decision to deploy a Bitcoin Cash block explorer and will continue to roll out related services. We are also deploying tools for other cryptocurrencies we find on a positive momentum path, such as ZCash, which have increased privacy value.
We will not add future support for the Blockstream fork of bitcoin (""Bitcoin Legacy""), and will be deprecating it entirely at some future point in time to be determined. Developments have revealed it to be a dead end. At such a time, we will refer to Bitcoin Cash as Bitcoin only, but will make some effort to not break API calls by changing URLs of legacy automated systems.

Come to think of it, it's the same with pretty much every coin today.  The only practical difference in today's use between coins is the transaction fees and confirmation times when transferring coins from one exchange to another.

"> I hope they are prepared to be attacked by gmaxwell's sockuppet army and theymos' r/bitcoin sheep.

Tbh I think Blockstream are overwhelmed. Once their level of aggression is matched they don't stand a chance against the entire community."
A combination of the market and hash power decides which is the 'real bitcoin'. Regardless of functionality moves such as this are premature and confusing to the market especially newcomers. Until the world truly values bitcoin cash more than bitcoin you are wrong to call them bitcoin and bitcoin legacy and are doing a disservice to the community. People need to stop referring to the whitepaper like a bible/constitution that would anticipate the many complexities a decade ahead.
"If you want to argue about Satoshi's vision, you'd support a fork of Bitcoin that didn't have an EDA, or at the very least didn't have significant bugs build around and EDA increasing centralization and supply.

Not necessarily saying Bitcoin in it's current state is the best solution, but Bitcoin Cash has some glaring centralization issues and propaganda going on. I'm all for big blocks, but Bitcoin Cash is not a decentralized system anymore."
That's not how forks work.
"Technically speaking, the chain spawned from the original genesis block, and with the most computational power behind it should be the chain  referred to as bitcoin. The BCH chain has more blocks, but the blocks themselves have less POW difficulty for now. It doesn't take a genius to predict this will not be the case in the relatively near future.

I'm one of those people who finds simplicity to be underrated. I'd prefer one single line of code, over an entire page that accomplishes the same thing. This, IMHO is the true beauty of Bitcoin, it has everything it needs to succeed as a secure cryptocurrency and nothing it doesn't. Whatever core is trying to turn their fork into wouldn't even make it into the top 100 alts, without using the brand name. The scaling issue has already been fixed on the BCH fork, this is where the confidence in the inevitable BTC/BCH flippening is coming from."

Hey bro, I know you lost much money because of blegacy. No reason to be mad at bitcoin :\^) 
"Since we're being ""technical"", the whitepaper only refers to the longest *chain* when determining which chain is valid. The bitcoin cash chain is longer.

But if we're looking for serious discussion, and not just 'tit-for-tat' shenanigans...

The intent of the whitepaper is to talk about the longest proof of work from the point of view of a person looking to validate that proof of work. In order to validate a chain, you need to set out some rules as to what is valid and what is invalid. Since the whitepaper *is* clear about how a transaction is authenticated (the signature is in the transaction), it would follow that anyone validating bitcoin (as per the whitepaper) would find that blocks that have segwit transactions are invalid, and therefore the proof of work is actually proof of invalid work. This would mean what is currently known as the Bitcoin Cash blockchain is also the longest valid accumulated work (again, if you're validating against the bitcoin whitepaper)."
It's not about knowing the future. It's about restoring Bitcoin to what it was before Core decided they knew better than all of us and denied us the chance to see this experiment through.

"If I understand correctly they are not relabeling bitcoin cash as bitcoin. They are relabeling bitcoin to ""Bitcoin Legacy"" until the time they believe cash has taken over and development of legacy dies and only at that time will Bitcoin Cash be relabeled as Bitcoin. I do however disagree with you that people have to stop looking at the white paper. It is what everyone that matters agrees is the basic rulebook for bitcoin. No one has to follow the rules laid out by Satoshi. But to maintain bitcoin I think it is imperative to change as few of the main tenants as possible. Otherwise why not increase the blocks to 21 billion? Then everyone entering the market now would have a chance to buy full BTC and not a fraction? Why not change to a proof of stake algorithm? Why not do any variety of major changes?  Everyone is welcome to take the bitcoin source and make a new coin with those changes (and many have). But they are not bitcoin and do not share the same chain. The version of bitcoin we will have in 50 years  will probably look very different than today's but we should not throw away the white paper and all the great ideas it contains without some very deep thought.

Yes, my wisdom is that their users are going to be burnt by this. BTC will become legacy at some point it the future. When the last exchange drops BTC as the default pair it will be a glorious day. Just not yet. Patience my son.
Gavin Andresen is the most naive, push-over developer out there. I know, he's probably a genius compared to me, but at least I understand that sometimes you have to take of the gloves and fight dirty for what you believe in.
most accumulated proof of work in a block chain.  if the transactions are not inside the block itself, it's not a block chain.  only bitcoin cash fully meets the definition of a block chain system.  bitcoin cash is bitcoin.
"True but it's politics and semantics (language is powerful). However even when Bitcoin Cash has majority hashrate I don't want to go back to the Bitcoin name. Why? Because we as a community get to decide if we want to change the name of something that is FOSS. Bitcoin is suppose to be like Cash. That is why the Bitcoin and Cash are now married (let's put a ring on it)  and I don't ever want to see a divorce. Bitcoin Cash is now a name that is becoming known all over the internet because it's so fricking awesome. It's just like Bitcoin in 2011 but with a bigger group of people that have heard about it. At least this is one of the few good things about the market price of all crypto being so high (won't last forever, half of my friends are going to hate the other half). People now listen when I talk about Bitcoin but most people have now idea that Bitcoin is Cash. They just think they are buying stock. If only they knew ... so I make my content and share it here and on yours.org and then I go: Hey somebody send me money over the internet with a 0.6 cent fee and it took 30 seconds before I saw it on my computer screen.  This is the power of participating and then telling people about how awesome participating it. 

So let's stay with the Bitcoin Cash name. Core will become obsolete anyways so we should not worry about them anymore. They are done, you can see they are loosing grip and power.

But because Bitcoin is an idea, whatever best follows the idea, gets to be called Bitcoin.  That is BCH, not BTC.  BTC scrapped Bitcoin to become something else.  The developers made false claims to push the adherents to BTC down a path that is not Bitcoin.  They need to give their new idea a new name.  Legacy Bitcoin is not the best name either.

Roger can keep telling the companies he has a big stake in to say stuff like this, it just looks petty. "
I've seen this bot a few times this week. Is it actually functioning here and the follow-up is just hidden? 
Someone please help me understand how its 2018 and we live in a world where someone with PTSD can't take whatever the fuck they need to take to help them without someone else telling them what to do?

Good guy /u/Pineapplefund advising people to donate directly. That's classy! :)
Baby steps. Ending the war would be extraordinarily difficult. MDMA for PTSD is a small, achievable goal.
Nor open-mindedness, empathy, or raised consciousness.  Evil pursuits we must be protected from!
"Why? It has been so succesful: it has completely eliminated gang turf wars, availability is waaay down, quality too.

Latest case in point: The heroin ""epidemic"" is solidly under control (has been replaced with fentanyl, excellent way to get rid of the cockroaches).

obligatory (gosh I hate you guys): /s"
This. For some substances it's really ridiculous what work they are doing in order to keep them forbidden. But it's too much to ask for to give them to people who could actually need them.
That can be an interesting philosophical thought, but it sure as hell isn't true.
"Have you ever tried it personally? If not I would just keep my mouth shut on it. It's one of those experiences that must be felt to understand.

>MDMA is not the way to do things

Maybe not for you, but it is for many others."
could you look a war vet in the eye and make the same recommendation?

"This video proposes no solution at all.

All it says is ""we don't think mental illness has any scientific basis, nor do we agree any mental illnesses are real""... it also says ""there is no such thing as schizophrenia, they probably just have brain damage"".

So what solution do they propose? When some extreme schizophrenics are physically harming themselves or their young siblings, and some 'big pharma scam' medication is helping at least calm them down, what alternative is proposed? Literally nothing is proposed in this video.

I agree that whatever 'mental illness' is, is certainly in its infancy compared to physical illnesses - this is quite obvious. And I also agree that some medicines are completely unnecessary and being pushed for no other reason than profit-taking. But, shitting on current attempts to try to help people without proposing solutions makes you an even worse offender in my book."

"Is there not a bulk of today's ""science"" arrived at by means of people being studied for their experiences, i.e. anecdotal evidence?"

"someone who smokes feel great, ""relaxed"" ""less stressed"" etc but end up with cancer years later. 

Again you can follow anecdotal evidence, I will stick with science "
CBT might help someone quit smoking, but so could nicotine patches. Both together is what MAPS is trying to offer here. Being against the PTSD-equivalent of nicotine patches is counter productive when both together have proven 60+% effective in eliminating PTSD in Phase 2 trials. These people are beyond desperate for help, with many of them presently drinking themselves to death. (I work in the mental health/addiction field. Believe me... not all drugs are created the same. I’ve seen thousands for opiates and alcohol... never a single person for MDMA or psilocybin addiction). MDMA could become  – through MAPS – as Shulgin wanted it to be... the “empathy” cure (not “ecstasy” cure) that saves their life in a therapeutic session.

Personal experience is worth far more than simple anecdotal evidence. It's the most pure form of research one can engage in - primary research
"That's not a possible option in many, many cases though.

There are schizophrenic patients who have been doing cognitive behavioral therapy for decades, yet without medication they still pose danger to themselves and others.

I agree that CBT is a great approach (and is similarly in its infancy), and should always be the first-option when possible, but in some cases not only does it not help, its simply not an option.

Your arguments, and those in the video, are spoken like someone who has not lived with and/or experienced someone closely who has extreme forms of autism and/or schizophrenia."

[What's gonna happen to the arms industry when we figure out we're all one?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dE45bAde84I)
That's because there is massive profit incentive to keep them illegal and massive industries that have formed around the pretense of them being illegal. For instance, the DEA, a massive bureaucratic institution has to continue to legitimize its own existence, other police bodies make loads of money off of arrests and seizure of property in drug arrests, pharmaceutical companies have competing products for the aforementioned use case, private prisons have to continue to drive profit for their investors which means full cells, the vendors that deal in this economy need bigger contracts think food, bedding, clothing, etc. This is one of the examples of where the US brand of capitalism creates perverse incentive, similar to healthcare. In general, I think I can say the societal goal of a prison system would be generally speaking public safety and hopefully most would say rehabilitation is a main goal. The goal of a private prison is to make profit, which can be done by imprisoning more nonviolent citizens with inane drug laws, lobbying for harsher penalties, etc. Basically things that run counter to the societal goal.  
I dont follow anecdotal evidence. I use science. 
"He concluded with cognitive behavioral therapy which is the most widely used evidence-based practice for improving mental health. He also has other videos citing sources of other solutions. 

As far as that ""war vet"" comment. I would recommend it more strongly as everything about war is brutal and violent. Including the process of how it started. 


Drugs are not a solution. Distracting/slowing and in a lot of cases, destroying your brain with drugs, is just halting your brain from activity including the possibility of a real solution

Because you are living in a world that stopped listening to Ron Paul because of a f*cking newsletter he didn't even write. 
I think you're confused. There's no such thing as Bcash. There's a project by that name, but they haven't released anything yet. Did you mean Bitcoin Cash?
"I feel you, but we need to be careful. FDA procedures for approving a drug, unlike most bureaucratic procedures, are heavily scientifically based, and properly conducted clinical trials are essential to ascertain the effectiveness and safety of a treatment.

Drugs are easily prone to become popular faith targets, where people will blindly believe they are getting any benefit, while getting none (or getting worse). In Brazil, people would stop cancer treatment, and instead take a drug developed by a rogue chemistry university lab that distributed it for free (the substance is called phosphorylethanolamine).

The situation remained lawless for years, until brought to public attention in mass media, which prompted the university to prohibit the lab from producing and distributing the drug. Then followed a public outcry in favor of the allegedly cure of cancer, and the university was forced to continue the production of the drug by legal injuctions broght by users and even a federal law was enacted allowing the exceptional use of the substance for cancer treatment. That law, for obvious reasons, was extremely ill received by the scientific community which had the supreme court to deem it unconstitutional.

In between the political chaos, proper clinical trials were started, which failed to show any effectiveness of the drug for cancer treatment. The initial (bad) results had the inclusion of new patients suspended in the clinical trials, for ethical reasons (treating cancer patients with sugar pills poses indeed ethical concerns). Study is still ongoing for original patients that haven't died, but all indication shows it will never develop into a useful treatment."

"That this subreddit is talking about MDMA is amazing.

I am extremly involved with pharmacology and have been following it for a long time as well have written a few nice theories available [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/7ix66i/phenibut_significantly_increases_bdnf_and_vegf_in/dr2a46d/).

I am thankful that maps exists and it is highly likely that MDMA will become a legitimate medicine around 2020.

Some other extremly promising medicines are ketamine for depression (extremly effective), psilocybin mushrooms or Lysergic Acid Diethylamine (LSD) for depression/anxiety/ptsd, and Iboga for opioid addiction (something I have personally struggled with).

Also, not on maps but from me personally.  Kratom has saved my life from opioid addiction.  It also can treat depression / anxiety / pain problems / ADHD / Drinking or Addiction Problems and on top of that, has some health benefits.  Visit /r/Kratom if you want to learn more about it.

"I get to be a criminal every day for the past 2+ years due to taking my doctor prescribed medication as directed.  My medication has **completely** turned my life around from nearly giving up/almost being on disability due to my tremors/seizures making life nearly impossible.  After the military I was in the hospital a couple times and it would have been great to have a better/alternate treatments than anti-depressants that almost led me to kill myself (anti-depressants were the worst thing I have ever took in my life and I have never felt so horrific/been in such a horrible place).  My **only** problem was anxiety keeping me awake at night, which led to being **very** sleep deprived, not fucking depressed like they kept insisting and ignoring the anxiety problems I was actually telling the doctors

The war on people (drugs) is a complete and utter failure in every way possible, but somehow nothing is done to solve it since people are relentlessly lied to about substances and their effects and the source of violence/crime that is **entirely** due to it's illegality, not the substances themselves

Add to all that the crucifixion by my family full of drunks for taking my medication while they live their lives in a drunk stupor/drinking and driving not giving a shit about anybody

Perhaps the sidebar can be updated though to be more streamline though. I don't remember the sidebar having an overhaul in 2 years lol."
Did you read my comment? I just explained why the sub is called r/btc.
Bitcoin (aka Bitcoin Cash) is the longer chain, which according to the bitcoin whitepaper, makes it the real bitcoin. Blockstreamcore (aka segshit) is offloading transactions to a centralized off-chain network instead of scaling as specified in the whitepaper. This makes blockstreamcore the altcoin.
Yep and thanks. just couldn't figure out which sub was talking about which coin. It's annoying frankly. lol

Many other ways were tried. The fork was ultimately inevitable (as some of us stated early on) but many tried other less controversial options (even in the face of divisive actions from Core supporters).

exactly LOL
:-) !!! 
‘‘Tis true. Nobody is contesting that.
"Unfortunately there was a whole thing about BCH to be referred to as ""Bitcoin Cash"" and not ""Bcash"" or variants that omit the ""Bitcoin"" name (it's considered very offensive, god forbid).   I get some of the reasoning but there is lots of confusion being sowed intentionally by both groups thinking they are somehow gaining a point.  Unfortunately they have completely forgotten about the end users who are sending coins to the wrong addresses and so forth.  It's an awful situation and the only way to fix in my mind is to start afresh.

The best way to get a broader view on crypto technology is r/CryptoCurrency. "
There's also bitcoin.com, @bitcoin on twitter, etc.. so not just this sub.
The great thing about decentralization and consensus means bitcoin is whatever fork the majority agree upon. If the majority agree that BCH is bitcoin (and this is shown to be true by having majority hashing power), then BCH is bitcoin. Right now the (possible) majority think btc is bitcoin, so it remains as such 
"you only have to ask one single question. ""Do you have open mod log?"""
"Why is asking about the ""war"" a sign that you are a shill?

Here people ask regularly that same question and we just answer it."
Thanks for that. IMO both are doing good things and frankly competition will only make it all stronger. That said, calling BCH bitcoin, aside from the pedantic and petty reasons, is not helping. That was my point of confusion. It makes BCH seem like a pretender to the throne, at least IMO. The reverence is becoming on par with religion, which I suppose the best way to get rich is to start a religion, so there is that... I think all that road map is awesome and do hope it succeeds along with a lot of others as well including BTC.
"Thanks, although I was making reference to the community here which was the point of the original question.  It's good to see a roadmap but take a glance of the front page of r/btc and see what the community is actually focused on.  ""Bitcoin legacy"", ""Blockstream"" and North Korean Bitcoin memes are a constant theme.  Surely this gives some indication of what important developments are going on in the BCH world? 

It's a sad state of affairs and reflection of the BCH project.  Of course, r/Bitcoin is not much better. "
"It's a very good point about usage, however there are many new unanswered questions and uncertainty as I see it.  We just don't know how dirty this game is going to get.  If we were to believe the BCH refrain, large banks are invested it making Bitcoin a success and killing off Bitcoin Cash.  Why would you possibly risk your investment just so you can pay a bill or buy something in crypto?  The revolution is much more than that and I think BTC and BCH are getting left behind because of this obsession they have for ""winning"" against the other. "
Thanks for the reply.  My reservation is around the whole involvement of key people being used to promote and fight for dominance.  Who will win?  The guy who undermines the other the best?  Bitcoin was never built on a hostile movement like this and the risks of both projects becoming irrelevant are high. 
BCC symbol is used on some exchanges such as Binance. 
#INACCURATE
"Well, as others have said, we created r/btc as refugees expelled from r/bitcoin, and this became the home for those wanting on-chain scaling.  As a result, Bitcoin Cash is our coin of choice.

As soon as Bitcoin Cash forked, someone squatted on r/bch, so that wasn't an option.  There is r/bitcoincash, which is also focused on Bitcoin Cash.  For many of us, r/btc has been our home for many years.

The naming and confusion stuff is marketing, and we need to get better at that.  This will happen over time.  I agree that there is a large 'Bitcoin Cash *is* Bitcoin' camp, and while I understand the sentiment, it is not helping matters.

It is all going to come down to marketing and message.  We may have the message, we just need the marketing now.

"r/btc was actually created in 2015 in answer to the r/bitcoin mods being corrupt and has been the forum for the rebels and people in the know for years. I've been a rebel since before r/btc and have been here from the very beginning btw. I rage quit at one point and deleted my account, /u/PsyRev, you can find me in reddit archives arguing with the mods on r/bitcoin back in 2014. This goes way back, the takeover began late 2013 with developers who didn't follow the narrative silently getting phased out of the bitcoin core development team.

As for key people. It's really overstated what it's like from our side, guessing you've been hearing we all follow Roger Ver like a cult or something. We don't. Roger is just a regular guy here who's been a known name for his early adoption endevours, and he's promoting bitcoin cash as I would in his shoes. The only reason it appears this is being 'played' by key people is because fake accounts over at r/bitcoin are making fake discussions slandering Roger and trying to make it seem like he's somehow tied to bitcoin cash more than just being one of the most known of people promoting it.

"Ok I will admit I was being hyperbolic, but the ""intent"" of my comment still stands. There is an awful lot of talk about bitcoin, when they mean the white paper and then there are some who refer to BCH as bitcoin, which it is not, it is bitcoin cash, semantics and game playing aside. 

Everything says ""bitcoin"" with ZERO mention of BCH and while I get the semantic argument, most of the people this forum would want to bring on board are not going to get the semantics of it. I'm not a ""commoner"" and I even got confused, I can;t imagine the the confusion noobs must feel hitting this sub. So yea, I think most people would agree that even just a single friggin sentence on the sidebar could clear all this up for any noobs (to the sub at least). I dunno, I just see so much missed opportunity from a branding point of view by the BCH crowd that its actually quite disheartening. Instead opting for the simplistic road of trying to dominate an original brand (which almost never succeeds mind you) be it intentional or lazy, same result. "
I did, I get the alternate forum, but why are bitcoin cashers here instead of bitcoin core people? that's what doesn't make sense.  can't you use an alternate name that doesn't mean bitcoin core? it's the exact ticker for bitcoin core

"I am not a noob to crypto, mined in 2009 and ever since assorted cryptos. To this sub I am and frankly have been trying to figure out for a couple months WTF side this sub is one. Just look at the fucking header and sidebar of this sub. I know the difference between BTC and BCH. Ive been in crypto from the start. The problem is this sub is not being clear and frankly looks bad by being almost intentionally deceptive. Bitcoin is not BCH, and the group needs to move forward, stand on its own two feet and stop trying to acquire users by way of deception at worst, and just lazy confusion at best. I have a decent chunk of both, and will continue to, because I am not an idiot and understand the theories outside of crypto that drive the economic forces that create the value of crypto. 

And no, at least half of the posts here mention the word ""bitcoin"", not BCH. But if you want to drive people away by being a douche and make it a hostile environment, like /r/bitcoin/ is claimed to be, then go right ahead. See how that helps your long term adoption of a coin you obviously are invested in enough to want the growth, as I do of both. It's the wrong strategy and it will not serve you or the coin well in the long term. Marketing is a manipulation of perception, and that goes all the way to how people discuss it with others. You wanna win, be more clear and help people to see the ""why"" not the what or how."
"THANK YOU. lol. and brain donkey, is because smart ass was taken :)

That clears it up. Two different coins, in the end hoping and pushing for supremacy. FUD and opinions aside.

I will say, a bit fucked up to name the sub btc when it is the fork and is called BCC/BCH. That in and of itself is a massive source of confusion and frankly, is a bad plan that makes it seem very very subversive and ill-intended. But alas, /r/trees/ is about marijuana and /r/marijuana is about trees, so whatever I guess.   "
"I don't understand what you don't understand about that being biased.

Edit: also, I wasn't saying you should include the link, but that you think it's 'tinfoil hat' is laughable. It's not a question of whether it's biased or not. But I'd still like an explanation."
"I appreciate the response and explanation, but it also is an example of the (I hope unintended) deception and confusion that is being caused. I know the difference between BTC/BCH, the problem is people refusing to move on and call it by it's name. Bitcoin is the original core, bch is the fork. But to say /r/BTC is for Bitcoin, I get the semantics of it, but most won't, and it is not helping the cause (which I agree with in part). Just my opinion, and of course have no ability to fix it, which I why I asked ;) 

I 100% agree about differentiation. The WHY (to chose BCH over BTC) needs to be focused on, not the how or what. Crypto is at a tipping point. When grand parents start asking if they should buy some crypto, you know its time to put on the big boy pants and start acting like a real industry which means, stop muddying the waters with who is who.

"We are for Bitcoin.  The coin described in the whitepaper that got so many of us excited years ago.  The coin that had low fees and reliable transactions.  That coin is no longer the one with the BTC ticker.  It is the one called Bitcoin Cash.

There is certainly an us/them identity thing going on, but it is because every day we're still getting posts asking how BCH is different from BTC.  That's normal and will eventually quiet down.

We're in a period where we have to differentiate ourselves.  We have a roadmap that will let BCH grow and support features separately from BTC (as they will also support features BCH does not have).  Until those features are distinct and more apparent, the us/them will unfortunately continue.

The r/btc crowd is made up of enthusiasts for Bitcoin, just not the same vision that Blockstream and Core support."
"i put takeover in quotes as it's the idea in /r/bitcoin, i agree i should have stated that in my comment.

my last comment is not biased at all? i'm not sure what your issue is with it?

i did not include that link as it is very biased."
"Where's your brain, donkey. Lol :) r/btc is for bitcoin cash (BCH) and r/bitcoin is for bitcoin core (BTC). BTC also goes by the name of bitcoin legacy by some.

And of course, r/bitcoin call it just 'bitcoin' because they intentionally didn't get the memo that it has changed from what it once was and the name 'Bitcoin' is up for grabs by any coin that shares the ledger from years past. And right now it's up to the market to decide in the longterm."
Hmm... 99% of the posts here are about how great Bitcoin Cash is or about how the other sub has become a place for brain washed shills who must toe the party line or GTFO. Come to think of it yes we need to hang a giant sign up for Noobs. Dude read little. Google is ur friend.
"It is though. The pedantic argument that ""this is actually the 'real bitcoin'"" is lost on 99% of the people you actually want to start adopting BCH instead of BTC. saying bitcoin bitcoin bitcoin over and over again doesn't help frankly. That was my confusion with ZERO effort to reduce that confusion in the header graphic and the sidebar (which is what they are there for). If everyone would just say BCH and BTC, and then refer to ""the bitcoin white paper"" it would be a LOT less confusing to noobs. I am NOT a noob, and I got the ever-loving shit confused out of me, mostly because I dont live/breath this stuff I assume, which is not the ""bar"" we should as a crypto enthusiast group trying to make it grow. We need to bar to be set lower so noobs can come on board. my opinion at least, which counts for nothing unless you would know my biz history."
Bitcoin cash is a fork, and it's ticker is BCH not BTC, why don't you bitcoin cash guys use r/bch?

"Thanks and I get it now. I actually have been in crypto since 2009 a bit after BTC landed, but just as a novelty at the time. (yes like a lot of people wish I could find that old wallet....) Started investing in accumulating a few coins back when at $1500 ish. Got a bunch of BCC from the fork. etc. So, I play in both arenas and more. I mine BTC and BCC and a couple others because, I think many are going to win, especially for at least the next couple years.

I just couldn't figure out the simpler part, which was, which friggin coin each sub was actually talking about because this one insists on calling BCC bitcoin. 

Frankly I agree with the Gavin crowd, but the fork was not helpful (except to my portfolio value) IMO. There had to be a better way. Anyway, thanks for the info. I appreciate it."

Well, I didn't say they wouldn't be replaced, but 2030 seems pretty optimistic :)
yessuh
I love bch, and dont want to see btc dead...they can do whatever the f they want.
Perfect thanks! That is exactly the answer I was looking for. And I do research any crypto I get into, just these two subs are not really helping the whole BCC/BTC issue. The bickering and FUD is a bit annoying, but that is anywhere. The real issue I was having is people in this sub calling BCC bitcoin. It is confusing the conversation unnecessarily.
"ok that might explain a bit of the ""WTF is going on here"" I have experienced. Sometimes its BCH sometimes its BTC. but I got it now. thanks! And yea, echo chamber for real."

You will get down voted for being misinformed, there is a clear roadmap and you only need to dig just a little bit to find it.

Not only this, there are several different proposals. Let me help you a bit:

* 32 MB blocks (very soon)

* New address format (done)

* Zero knowledge proofs 

* Colored coins/tokens (very soon)

* Op codes/ smart contracts

* CashShuffle and ledger nano s in ElectronCash (done)

* Tippr bot integration everywhere (growing fast)

* 0-conf stronger with weak blocks

There were so many good news that ususally are a full roadmap of the majority of shitcoins that there is really not much else to say.

"> Bitcoin Cash is unfortunately a risky alternative since it is linked to major holders such as Roger Ver who would have no problem dumping his major holding on your head when you decide to buy-in (it's not illegal, after all).

I don't know much about the major holders of BCH, other than there are clearly more than Roger Ver, but I don't get the impression you know either. However, if the major risk you see is simply drop in market price because some one sells, then who cares? What is not risky, is the BCH is essentailly what the white paper described, and can, at least for some while, scale to accommodate *actual usage* which surely was the original intent of Bitcoin"
"> Bitcoin Cash is unfortunately a risky alternative since it is linked to major holders such as Roger Ver who would have no problem dumping his major holding on your head when you decide to buy-in (it's not illegal, after all)

20k coins really is not significant to the market. 700k BCH have already been dumped by GBTC and Xapo before and the market has held fine. Also I've seen far worse, like when the bearwhale sold 30k coins a few years back."
Perfect. You answered and I think you and I have similar views on the whole thing. I frankly agree with the Gavin camp, but the fork was a bad idea. So BCC is better, but BTC is entrenched and frankly should have been fixed, and probably will be somehow I am sure. But of course petty thinking and egos win, both sides being at fault. I am actually in quite a few coins, some a feel are trying to do interesting things, some I think are filling a potential need and then of course a couple flyers because why not when the price is right. Thanks for the info and the opinions. It's more of what is needed around these subs. More straight up even tempered conversation. not the neener neener crap that pushes the important stuff down. 
"Careful, don't say ""BCH/BCC"" - The ticker BCC is bitconnect, and bitconnect is... well, lets say that people have mixed opinions on bitconnect, but only one of the two has active and pending C&D orders...

"> The developers of BTC appear to be tainted in some way - there is no competent project team that would ever let the current situation linger as it has with Bitcoin's high fees and slow transfer times. It's extremely suspicious and it appears they are either trying to kill off Bitcoin or ransack users with fees well after the LN network horse comes riding in.

Well the thing is, they actually did do something about it. With segwit, btc has double the capacity, just sitting there, mostly unused by the main transaction producers.

So right now, the btc chain is like a 2 lane road, and Coinbase parked their truck in one of the lanes. So what's the solution? Do you create a new lane? Or do you ask Coinbase to stop being an dick and move their truck? If you do end up creating a new lane, why would Coinbase move their parked truck? What stops them from blocking the new lane with another truck?

That's pretty much what's going on, except it's not just Coinbase. A bunch of other big companies, like blockchain.info, are doing this type of stuff too. And there's no real technical reason for this, it seems to be political mostly. Migrating to segwit is pretty easy tbh. I mean a lot of wallets enabled segwit addresses immediately after it got activated.

I feel like there are some people with really shady motives getting rich off normal people. And to me, it really doesn't seem to the devs. Most of them seem to be legit old school free software and GNU/linux hackers. Do you really think they are that shady compared to other people? Most of the ones working on core have been working on the implementation for years, before this was worth any money."
lol thats where I have ended up. I have both. Hate/Love both for different reasons. It's the deception that was confusing the hell out of me, and based on the responses I am getting, I am not alone in thinking it is deceptive.

Yeah I get you :)
I disagree.  Even Bitcoin was no where there.  You forget that the system is easy to corrupt and ends up like the banking system it is trying to replace.  History will repeat itself unless there are new checks and measures in place.

">Nope I'm not talking about you singling out subs or not.

then your point is moot, my comment was not biased or singled out a sub or person, i used ""both sides"" which can encompass multiple platforms and areas. it was not based on opinion it is based on fact - which was the main whole idea of my comment. 

from your comments it's fair to say you are a BCH supporter, just because i do not like BCH myself does not mean i can make unbiased comments about the situation. "
"> You forget that the system is easy to corrupt and ends up like the banking system it is trying to replace.

Completely disagree. It's not easy to corrupt. The system is designed to be fueled by greed. The greed of a miner to maximize his profits. This is a very reliable mechanism. To bribe it you'd have to bribe a huge industry of hard to locate individuals who already earn more than enough money by just being honest participants. Even the attempt to do this would leak and make everyone look very very closely. Ultimately the system is not corruptible because users have a choice to simply use another currency (with another PoW). The sheer possibility of this makes miners ultimately play nice. They are in competition with the coins that use other PoW algorithms."

Id say most of it is just legitimate information that people should know about. Yes, some can be considered propaganda, but what do you expect when they are fighting against the blockstream propaganda machine for relevance? This will happen when you are fighting for truth.
"That's part of a meme because of things Adam Back said actually. And he pretty much is, considering he practically owns the Core development team. Although his investors own him, obviously.

And yeah a few of them will, and they'll be telling the truth. They've just sadly been deceived. I haven't seen many there as of late though."
"I do find that r/btc is more heavily focused on the technology than a lot of crypto subreddits. That's why I enjoy coming here. 

There are a few memes here and there, and it's just people making fun of r/bitcoin. I don't actually mind it. It isn't meant to be a completely professional forum. It's reddit for fucks sake."
">  just because i do not like BCH myself does not mean i can make unbiased comments about the situation.

What does that even have to do with anything? Hahahah

And I'm *not* talking about singling out a sub or not. I'm talking about just saying that the sub has tinfoil hat conspiracies."
Roger Ver has said lots of moronic things as well.  And so completes the never ending circular argument. 
">What does that even have to do with anything?

you're defending something, whether it be yourself/this sub or /r/btc when i haven't attacked anyone or anything. 

>that the sub has tinfoil hat conspiracies.

not sure what sub you mean, as i didnt specify any. "
The other side are fighting against blockstream propaganda as well? Good, then they aren't the other side, we are the same side!
"It can be regarded as such only if you forget the point of what is this supposed to be about. The idea in the whitepaper, the vision of a global cheap, nearly instant, secure, permissionless currency, to give financial freedom to anyone and everyone in the world.

This aligns at all levels with Bitcoin Cash purpose and trajectory, and attracts the same people felt in love with Bitcoin at the beginning.

The same can not be said about Bitcoin BTC, because it has derived so much from the vision that many of us believe it has completely lost its way. Either by incompetence, malice or a mixture of both. And everything else, like circumstancial evidence that can provide context to this scenario doesn't contradict that, quite in fact the opposite. Each day it passes is more clear what the real deal is, and what is not."
Roger Ver and Adam Back are not comparable in the slightest, Adam Back is an absolutely terrible person who is purposefully destroying a technology for his own benefit. He's paid by the Blockstream benefactors to sabotage and disrupt bitcoin and its community. Making memes about him is not comparable to Roger Ver who's just a regular guy with some low emotional intelligence in some areas.
"> not sure what sub you mean, as i didnt specify any.

???????????

Well, I have you tagged as a troll from before, when you were being more obvious about being a troll, I now seem to have that tag confirmed that you haven't changed."
And I could continue the argument by saying that BTC hasn't seen the same usage as BTC, doesn't have the same developer experience, can they handle critical issues, etc, etc.  All important points when betting on a crypto. 
One thing I love about being here is the amusing comments like this. 
"your point about my tinfoil comment makes no sense.

can you specify how i'm being a troll? is it because i like Bitcoin and tried to be unbiased?

on another note, this 10 minutes per comment limit is still v annoying. "
"Doesn't have the same developer experience?

And yes, they've been able to handle critical issues very well so far, like with the EDA."
?
Lol. Keep up the charade.
I'm trying to say I had a laugh with your comment (and not being sarcastic, either :) 
Why?
Again, the other side claims the same thing.  
"Two differently traded coins, BTC (Bitcoin) and BCH/BCC (Bitcoin Cash).  The two communities are entirely fractured and there is no hope of reconciliation.  The spirit of what brought Bitcoin alive is completely dead.  

The developers of BTC appear to be tainted in some way - there is no competent project team that would ever let the current situation linger as it has with Bitcoin's high fees and slow transfer times.  It's extremely suspicious and it appears they are either trying to kill off Bitcoin or ransack users with fees well after the LN network horse comes riding in. 

Bitcoin Cash is unfortunately a risky alternative since it is linked to major holders such as Roger Ver who would have no problem dumping his major holding on your head when you decide to buy-in (it's not illegal, after all).  If there is a development roadmap, they don't talk about it too much and instead post pictures like OP's (as amusing as it is) while lamenting the memes on r/Bitcoin. 

Anyway, you get the idea.  If you want the baggage, get into Bitcoin (and variants).  If you're here for a stable store of value or to invest in technology, then there's already viable, secure, cheap replacements in production with proven project teams (not just tech-heads, either). 

P.S. Note the censorship r/btc style. I might not get banned here but there's no love for people who don't tow the BCH line.

Awesome summary! $0.5 u/tippr
"This is great outlay of the problem. Stubbornness is hurting the understanding of what is being talked about on this sub. I fully understand and appreciate the details of the ""fight"" but when the same words are used by both sides to discuss different things, it just makes the conversation that much more confusing for new folks (which I am not, just this sub confused the hell outta me). And new folks are what any new product or service needs. Otherwise it's a hobby."
"Well said. 

I fell in love with bitcoin when it was $3. To me, Bitcoin Cash represents the true bitcoin. I hold 0 BTC since early last year. 

"
I think you shouldn't ignore the effords of the Bitcoin Cash community to improve that situation. See for example the new bitcoin cash address format that will launch this january. With that users will be saved from making mistakes.
"Thats what I am FINALLY understanding lol. Its a bit of a waste of effort and focusing on the wrong thing to be so butthurt and childish about the name. The name should be irrelevant. And because there is so much focus on ""it's the real bitcoin"" (which it may be the original intent, but it is NOT the original bitcoin in the wild) is doing nothing but harm by calling it ""bitcoin"". But coming from a technology marketing background for 15 years, I guess I see things from a different angle the the uber nerds who can't stand when someone calls their dog a good boy, when it is in fact a girl. Wrong thing to focus on, they like your dog..."
"oh of course, I think it's a terrible way to go about it. Marketing 101, differentiate your product. Coat tailing only gets so far. BCH could stand on its own I think with little to no issue. So just it just needs to grow the hell up and start acting like it's ""own man"" in a way. Just this sub was for some reason confusing the ever-loving hell out of me."
"The problem is, thats how you kill an industry. vagaries and confusion do not make consumers happy campers. I do understand the sentiment, completely now, but there has got to be a better path forward. Otherwise both BTC and BCH are going to die when another coin swoops in and markets better and more clearly. What I do like is that a lot of conversation has shifted to ""invest in blockchains"" instead of the past specific names. But tis the trials of cutting edge, which this still technically is regardless of many peoples insistence it is not. Thanks for the back and forth btw."
Looks like trying to start a flame war. I prefer BTC over Bitcoin because the community over here seems a little more mature.
"It has nothing to do with ""religion"", core minions throw these petty arguments everywhere. We are following a *scientific paper*, but we are not keeping it like a sacred monolith, we are improving things, while not changing what bitcoin is and was intended to be.

If we are rigorous about what bitcoin is and was intended to be, we conclude they are a rogue take over. Their roadmap doesn't exist apart from ""wait for the lightning network"" and creating patents to profit from their ""layer 2"" great ""$olution$"".

Believe me, the attacks started and were always from them, with very immoral tactics. Now the rebels strike back to reclaim the galaxy, grab the popcorn while an increase number of figures in the space drop them."
Not really a reflection of the bch project. We have every right to be mad, the last few years have been completely unreasonable beyond what I can express in words.
"I upvoted you. Even thought I don't agree with you. Your opinion has value and we don't need to suppress it but discuss it like adults. Too many people use the voting system on reddit to further their agendas instead of engaging in bipartisan discussion.

I would say that the health of the investment (in BCH, or BTC) is, in the long term, very much dependent on us being able to pay a bill or buy something with it - usability is a big part of the revolution for me. I agree BTC/BCH are at risk of getting left behind. But I do believe that BCH will have its day, since its usage is steadily increasing, and I believe it will scale well (on-chain) up to a point. Whether it lasts longer term is another matter.
agree. the petty bickering is a disservice to both solutions distracting from the goal which is to grow and sustain.
"Copy pasting what I just wrote in another comment I just made, I'm lazy and tired sorry haha:

It's really overstated what it's like from our side, guessing you've been hearing we all follow Roger Ver like a cult or something. We don't. Roger is just a regular guy here who's been a known name for his early adoption endevours, and he's promoting bitcoin cash as I would in his shoes. The only reason it appears this is being 'played' by key people is because fake accounts over at r/bitcoin are making fake discussions slandering Roger and trying to make it seem like he's somehow tied to bitcoin cash more than just being one of the most known of people promoting it."
Pointing out the emperor with no clothes is definitely a productive part in ensuring this situation does not happen again.
"You seriously don't understand how just saying the sub has tinfoil hat conspiracies is biased. How do I even explain this? LMAO

Alright, what fault from r/btc and BCH is there that's being devoided there? And which are the opinionated pieces and to what degree are they biased?"
Because bitcoin cash was created as a direct result of this community. Why would everybody move?
"straw man much?

I'm not comparing the degree of discomfort to those you compared to a murderous despotic regime.  I am merely saying that in both cases, someone is expressing their opinion."
"So someone else comparing people to murderous dictators is disgusting, but you comparing people to genocidal dictators is cute.

Thank you for proving my point. You’re a dogmatic nutjob.

Comparing people who express opinions contrary to yours (bitcoin core devs, you) to murderous despotic dictators (Kim Jong Un, Adolf Hitler) is idiotic.

Thank you.  I must say that I have previously had quite hostile responses when just trying to express an alternate view.  I know this whole thing is very charged but I think somehow there needs to be a refocus on the technology which is all that matters.  Politics will always try to pollute this because there is so much at stake. 
I'm guessing that there's lots of misinformation about BCH but as you can see from this post, it's perpetuated on both sides.  It's getting nowhere and many people have forgotten exactly what was appealing with the Bitcoin project to begin with (aside from the $$). 
">there are tinfoil hat conspiracies coming from both sides explaining why who did what and how.

I never singled out a sub, not sure what you mean.

There are opinionated posts and points, some accusations without proof only with opinion (not saying it's wrong) but that is biased opinion.

"Yep just voicing a point of confusion that I am sure (and sounds like from a few responses) that I am not alone.

fair enough.  it's just confusing is all.

I can say the same thing about bitcoin core. Truth is they both are bitcoin. In the long run it's just a question of how significant they are, or if we should call them alternatives/versions.

What do you mean by this?

"Bitcoin Core has been losing ground, it's been harder and harder for /r/Bitcoin to ignore the problems, and more time consuming to moderate than they can handle. They have more reasons then ever to continue banning people, but it's much more difficult now. From my short time using both subs this sub is pretty lax compared to r/bitcoin's heavy handed censorship. They might not allow every shitpost here, but they are basically fighting the censorship of r/bitcoin.

On a side note, I just discovered today how bad it is, I tried to move some mining rewards from nicehash, they let you send to coinbase for free so I did that, but I'm in a jurisdiction that can't use coinbase's GDAX exchange so $49.00 in bitcoin will cost me over $17.00 to move to an exchange I can use. 

It's $1.99 *total* for me to instead just use coinbase to convert my BTC to USD then send USD from my bank to Gemini where I can buy ETH then move to an exchange from there. Ridiculous."
"my personal opinion: ""just couldn't figure out which side was which"" i treat both sides with an equal amount of dislike/like. i understand and see the bias in both sides which is why i don't like one or the other as i believe both sides are terrible, but in saying that i dont hold any BCH and dont intend to in the future as i dont see it as ""Bitcoin"" as they are they are trying to claim."
I encourage anyone doubting whether this comment is correct or wrong, to go test it for themselves. Go to r/bitcoin and open a post asking about the censorship and Bitcoin Cash and see the results.

"This tiny tiny company MICROSOFT agrees with /r/bitcoin

Quality shitpost btw"
This sub is just as bad. That could be a pic of bitcoinxio.
"You realise this goes both ways? You could change the dude to Roger Ver, Change r/bitcoin to r/btc, change bcash to BCore, post it on r/Bitcoin, and it would work just as well.

[This](https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/6rxw7k/informative_btc_vs_bch_articles/dl8v4lp/?st=jaotbt8m&sh=222ce783) might help explain things.
/r/bitcoin is a heavily censored subreddit. You will literally get banned if you even question the direction of the core developers. A lot of the people on this sub including myself are no longer allowed to participate in that sub. This image points to the similarities between /r/bitcoin and North Korea. In both places anyone who expresses doubt is either murdered (NK) or banned (Reddit)
"r/bitcoin is a censorship propaganda machine. BTC's core development is entirely taken by a small group of people that crippled it to sell second layer ""solutions"", where they hold patents and will make money out of it. This is why you have ridiculous confirmation times and fees.

This sums up everything.

r/bitcoin is duping the noobs by censoring anyone asking questions about the fees, about bitcoin cash, or any criticism. They are duping the noobs by saying that satoshi was wrong!! And that the white paper is pretty bad and misleading. 

And many other things."
It's funny, because from the other side r/BTC looks exactly how you see r/bitcoin. Just with Roger or fake Satoshi on flag...

Are u brain-dead? Takes 5 mins reading both to figure it out
/r/btc supports bitcoin cash even though btc is actually the tracker for Bitcoin.  Makes no sense and is very deceiving, along with bitcoin.com, the @bitcoin twitter feed also both being very deceiving.  Imagine if bitcoin core supporters made a website called bitcoincash.com and promoted bitcoin core.  that's what's going on here.  Keep in mind that new comers aren't going to understand the difference between bitcoin and bitcoin cash.  those are the targets of the deception.

Yeah. BCH's true competition is not BTC, it is newer cryptocurrencies like XMR, XRB, etc. Time to stop beating the dead horse called BTC and move on.

">it’s not like how you guys make it to be


Totally and utterly false.  I have seen exact comments of zero concern result in people’s banning.  Many times.  

I was banned for saying that Bitcoin is supposed to be peer to peer cash akin to handing someone a dollar. Instant and “free” with no third party.  

I’ve been in this scene since Bitcoin was $59 and have poured the last 7 years of my life into promoting it.   The moderators all know who I am and I have corresponded with them and Greg Maxwell (shoot - and everyone else you’ve heard of) for years.  

I am banned and never allowed back for saying the above.  

The abuse of power is so egregious at this point that conspiracy theories seem to be the  only rational explanation.  I try not to go there, but I cannot explain it otherwise. "
"i'll be as objective as possible(most of the replies here have been very biased)

/r/bitcoin became very censored and controlled by some mods, so they made /r/btc to escape that. then we had a fork of bitcoin in august 2017 which split it into Bitcoin(BTC) and BitcoinCash(BCH), ones uses offchain transactions as a temporary solution and the other increased the blocksize (BTC has a blocksize of 1mb). BTC dev team think increasing blocksize too much and too fast is a bad idea, and the BCH dev teams think it's fine and doesn't compromise decentralization. BCH has/is being heavily advertised by Roger Ver (mod in this sub) in order to gain control and ""take over"" the name Bitcoin - it's common for /r/bitcoin to use ""Bcash"" and /r/btc to use BitcoinLegacy or names such as cripplecoin/segshit etc.this sub has become home to BCH and if your view differs from liking BCH you will downvoted and called a troll, while at /r/bitcoin you will most likely have your post removed and and possibly banned (i will note, i am frequent in both subs and have yet to be banned from there myself)

there are tinfoil hat conspiracies coming from both sides explaining why who did what and how."

"from one of the links in another comment, I now fully understand that part, and frankly the couple interviews I have seen with Gavin, at least make me ""feel"" he is actually trying to do right. I now just can't figure out, are both subs for ""bitcoin"" just pushing for different solutions to the ""issues""? "
thanks! That is helpful.
Thanks, and that is 100% what my opinion has been, just couldn't figure out which side was which. If the BCH crowd is so confident in their solution, why all the deception in the header and the side bar making it seem like this sub is for Bitcoin, when this sub is in fact for BCC/BCH. That makes it all suspect and tells me the growth potentially could have been built on ignorance, which is not a long term foundation... That said, I have BCC also because there can be multiple winners. 
"You say you're being as objective as possible, but..

> BCH has/is being heavily advertised by Roger Ver (mod in this sub) in order to gain control and ""take over"" the name Bitcoin

First off, he's talked about it on CNBC and he's added the section on bitcoin.com about BCH. Heavy advertising? As for the name.. The objective truth there is that the name is for whatever people consider bitcoin. I definitely consider bitcoin cash the true bitcoin, so to me it's 'bitcoin'. If you want to be objective when talking about the name you have to mention that they're both bitcoin and one may be insignificant in the future.

> there are tinfoil hat conspiracies coming from both sides explaining why who did what and how.

"I must be a fucking retard then, and that is quite helpful. :/

The problem is, that unless you live and breath this shit, which I sure as hell don't, it is not clear.

Which currency is /r/btc/ for and which currency is /r/bitcoin for. Lets make the question that simple."
"No it's not deceiving, first off, bitcoin cash is bitcoin too and it's deceiving you can only speak of bitcoin core at r/bitcoin if what you're saying is true. And here's a copypaste of another comment of mine addressing the name 'r/btc':

r/btc was actually created in 2015 in answer to the r/bitcoin mods being corrupt and has been the forum for the rebels and people in the know for years. I've been a rebel since before r/btc and have been here from the very beginning btw. I rage quit at one point and deleted my account, /u/PsyRev, you can find me in reddit archives arguing with the mods on r/bitcoin back in 2014. This goes way back, the takeover began late 2013 with developers who didn't follow the narrative silently getting phased out of the bitcoin core development team."
"Imagine if a bunch of Bitcoin Core supporters created a subreddit called r\/bcash then tried to push adoption of that name so they could misinform people looking for honest information about Bitcoin Cash.

Wait, you don't have to."
"EXACTLY. so I am not crazy. YEAY. lol 

And yes, that is the thing that has made me very suspicious of BCC from the start. Mind you I still hold a decent chunk, but deceptive and unethical imo. I just know how money works, and frankly unethical and deceptive usually wins... "
"lol yea. And now after reading the link posted by /u/dat1newb I get the sub difference now. Still not clear on the coins however. But I ""think"" both are for bitcoin, but /r/btc/ is for the simpler solution of increasing the transition limit (which I agree with as well). Basically camp Gavin and camp Thanos or whatever the fuck his name is. is that correct?"
pretty much what I am seeing from some responses. LOL Its like visa and Amex fighting.
THAT is where I am starting to arrive at. The vitriol and stupidity is just hurting each side. But then again, I shouldn't expect more from reddit. 
I've questioned their direction many times. They are ban-heavy but it's not how you guys make out at /btc

"Really?

You can’t envision what the difference is between a subreddit banning people and an oppressive regime torturing and murdering people?

Are the r/bitcoin mods literally Hitler?"
I agree, but when the first page is 90% memes its very counterproductive to anything

">no, segwit is still valid under old rules&gt;

No but we can both agree SF are coercive."
[deleted]
">it was a clever solution that put data outside the scope of the block as identified by old clients

Hidding data to old node allowed segwit to make change only possible via HF.

Same trick can be applied to break any protocol rule.

>it's not necessarily good or bad in and of itself, only how it is implemented (or to what end) can be judged that way

The problem is it allow a small group of people to relax some rules on the protocol.

Extremely dangerous.

>SFs are definitely permissionless

And that a bad thing.

Economic protocol change should require node approval (HF) for obvious reasons."
[deleted]
"> So how is BCH a peer-to-peer cash system and BTC is not??

It's simply a question of objectives.  BTC seeks to move end-user transactions offchain.  That's where the ""cash"" function will live.  Onchain will be the ""digital gold"" system used to settle accounts.  So they have fundamentally different objectives now.  Also, BTC has this strategy of 'anyone can validate' which necessitates very small blocks."
that's my point. Cap < demand = centralization. 
"No, it was not political at all. And simply posting the definition of political doesn't help your argument either.

 Miners are motivated by one thing: profit. 

They want bigger blocks so they can squeeze more transactions into a block and collect more fees. Plus, bigger blocks = more transactions = higher price for a Bitcoin. 

And since miners usually own lots of BTC, increasing price of a coin increases their net worth. So add that to the increase in fee revenue, and you've got adequate motivation to increase the block size for sure. 

And as the keepers of the blockchain, the people who have invested the most into it's security, they're more than qualified to make that decision. 

The people being ""political"" honestly are the small blockers, who have **not** invested into the security of the chain.

"You seem to believe that Bitcoin Core depository is some sort of Holy Grail.

But it is not, and it was corrupted by Segwit implementation, so it is not holy anymore in any case.

You should go back and re-read the white paper.

THAT is the holy grail, and it can not be corrupted.

You can always reimplement it back, because it's so [relativelly] simple.

Which Bitcoin Cash has done."
"> A Soft Fork can only add more rules.
> Hard Forks can remove rules.

This is true but misleading, since it's valid for the added rule to be: ""All blocks must be empty, and the coinbase string must contain a commitment to a different data structure"". At which point the new data structure can have whatever new rules you want it to have.

So sure, technically, we only constrained the rules further but that's no comfort to anyone if the net effect is coin confiscation, doubled inflation, or blacklists."
"I, and I'm sure many others, thought like you and held to the very end hoping for segwit2x to go through. 

All I saw through the years was the maxblocksize increase going from being a given agreed by all to 8 MB or higher to 2MB sometime to nothing. This followed by increased hostility and a change of opinions by those with the most influence. 

Segwit2x death was the time I had to go with the cash branch as being the successor of Bitcoin. Others like me took a bit longer to realize. That is why ltc fanatics and such are so confused, because they don't see that this is the Bitcoin network and community choosing a path (as usual: at first slowly and then all at once). "
">Core was in control all the time.

>If they merged the change: nothing would have changed, only by refusing to merge the change they took risk of being fired and splitting the currency *(over a 2MB blocks upgrade!! How crazy is that?)*

The Core client development is slow and careful, merging in changes quickly and changing their plans would go against those principles. Segwit2x even turned out to be bugged, so good thing they didn't.

>How B2X be a takeover if it only took Core a few line code change to stay in the game?

You're saying it wouldn't be a takeover because they could just go along with the changes. That's true, but it clearly means that they would be going along with someone else's decision in which they were not involved.

>>Even so, segwit increases the blocksize to roughly 2MB, 

>It certainly failed to deliver.

Because segwit isn't yet being used by most transactions.

>It shows to everyone that segwit never had consensus to begin with.

By r/btc's definition of consensus it did, because 80% of miners voted for it. 

It's an optional feature so it doesn't hurt those that don't want to use it.

>Well even Bitcoin core has fully implemented it.. manipulation? I agree.

It has supported it from command line since day 1, which is what matters. GUI support is nearly here but companies don't need GUI support to start using it.

>There is no spare capacity.. fees are well above $10 for the smallest tx.

Only 10% of transactions use segwit, there's still a lot of unused capacity. "
"I've recently had trouble finding great discussions of why ghash.io shot over 51% and the orphaned block problem that drove the need for the fibre thin block ""compression"" (really a referencing scheme). It's no accident though that after ghash.io, many core developers suddenly stopped talking about how easy block size increases can be implemented.

Yes, 2x would have been ""easy"". I think it should have happened (not just the 2x fork as it happened, but one driven and vetted by core developers). Then again, I think coinbase should have implemented segwit months ago, and miners should have implemented it back in 2016!

But who cares what I think?"
[deleted]
"> the rate of orphaned blocks increased significantly around 250MB per block

What is meant by this? What does the ""250MB"" number mean? Do you have a link where I can read about this?

> They had designed a soft fork upgrade that they considered less risky than a hard fork

Less risky than changing the economic properties of Bitcoin? Less risky than making merchants quit accepting Bitcoin transactions? Less risky than causing a fork of the main chain into BCH? The current set of Core developers unfortunately ignore any non-engineering risks. The developers that spoke to these risks were booted from the project or quit out of frustration - Gavin, Mike Hearn, Jeff Garzik, and I'm sure many lesser known devs. Good luck to such a cryptocoin project.

> items on the hard fork wish list

I think the odds of there being a hard fork of BTC that does not cause a chain split to be very low at this point. There will be a group of people that will try to keep the original chain alive either because they honestly believe ""Bitcoin should never hard fork"" or just to weaken BTC and strengthen a different coin (specifically BCH, but probably also Monero and others). If the Core dev team wanted a future hardfork to possibly make changes other than a blocksize increase, i think they have ruined the chance for that to not cause a chain split. The new hard-forked Core coin would most likely have to give up the ""BTC"" and ""Bitcoin"" monikers. Because of this, I don't think we'll ever see BTC attempt a hard fork. The Core devs kinda messed up if they really did want a future hard fork - a simple 2MB blocksize increase could have been so easy! :)"
"You didn't hear me.  I guess I'll try repeating myself.

If you want a coin with both Segwit and large blocks, you can

1. Fork BTC and increase block size, or

2. Fork BCH and add Segwit

\#1 will be much easier to code.  I'd suggest that route.

Core has made it abundantly clear for four years running right up until now that larger blocks are simply *not* the strategy.  **There was just a referendum on this and it failed.**

Learn from BCH.  Stop trying to impose your minority opinion on the BTC majority who do not wish larger blocks.  Mine a fork with the parameters you prefer.  Be free of this and have the coin you think is optimal.  Compete in the market."

It is true that it is a very complex decision.  Ultimately there can be only one coin with the most hashrate, only one coin with the biggest blocks, and one coin with the smallest blocks.  By definition, no coin can be the best at everything.

There is no value in personalized coins each mined individually with the parameters we choose, but not accepted by anyone else.  Unfortunately this means none of us is going to get the perfect coin.  Only a handful of truly viable coins will emerge and you gotta go with the one you want.

You could also say the same thing about a person who sees a friend hitting himself in the face with a hammer who says, ""hey, stop hitting yourself in the face with a hammer!""

Core was in control all the time.

It certainly failed to deliver.

It shows to everyone that segwit never had consensus to begin with.

Well even Bitcoin core has fully implemented it.. manipulation? I agree.

You can, segwit did just that.

Because restricting the rules change the characteristics of the currency.

"Exactly. Anyone who thinks LN ""solves"" scaling is crazy. First and foremost, you have to do two transactions on chain to process through a payment channel. At current blocksize, that means you can only process two or three payment channels a second, or ~100 million a year. That may sound like a lot, but at that pace the only way to give every human a payment channel would be to make one at birth and wait for everyone who doesn't have one to die (as it'd take about 75 years to process the 7.5 billion you need). Realistically, you'll need several channels per person, and you'll want to be able to process at least a billion people's worth of payment channels a year.

Long run, the blocksize will have to increase. Maybe we'll start quadrupling it every four years starting in 2024, ending in 2040 with 256MB blocks and the ability to process around a thousand payment channels a second."

>If it was just a technical change  most people would be ok with it. 

So why no 2MB hf since?"
If the blocksize limit was removed, miners would decide themselves how many transactions to put in each block. Each miner could make that decision for themselves instead of it being dictated to them by developers who think they know best
"Why is this getting downvoted?

Well, you can have both.  You can have on-chain TX be cheap, because of bigger blocks, and you can enable LN, so that people making recurrent or low-latency payments can have that as well.  In fact, LN works better with bigger blocks, cheaper to open and close channels, you just aren't REQUIRED to do it, like with Core's implementation.  If it saves blockspace, great, but it doesn't need to be prioritized over simple on-chain TX.
">Would have just liked it to be a Coke for the rest of its existence... as its inventor intended.

Satoshi also discussed payment channels and actually developed the first version of one. Sadly it was vulnerable to a miner colluding with a user but it was improved over time by other people until we reached the modern version used in LN. "

Can you imagine, that Coke spun off two divisions, Coke Classic and New Coke (Pepsi flavored coke) and all of the Pepsi-Coke stock holders are demanding that Coke Classic be called ""Classic Beverage"" but can't use the name Coke.  

Its ridiculous."
">the same trick can't be applied to break any protocol rule, though,

Yes you can, as long as the old node can’t see the new data you can relax any rules.

Even supply.


>you can't relax the rules without a hard fork, 

Again segwit did.

>you can only work around them if it's technically possible, as in the case w/ SW because it was possible to work around.  not all rules are the same.

It is possible to go work around the 21 millions limit too.

Hide the new supply to old nodes and enforce a soft fork that allow only transactions going to that new data structure.

To old it would appear that onlt transactions going to burn adress get validated.

That new data space can have any consensus rules.. even infinite supply.

this is what i mean dude, BTC is bitcoin & always will be. BCH is a fork called bitcoin cash and always will be. if you think otherwise you are delusional.
Great but that's not an argument, it's a plea to emotion based on nothing. If you're doing your investing based on semantics I feel really sorry for you.
*That when a SHA-256 walks in with 0-conf and a big block in you face you get strung! Bitcoin's back!*
">&gt;The rbitcoin propaganda campaign « Bitcoin cash is a scam » might explain why some still push for a block size increase on BTC instead of simply moving their investment.

>Just like Bitcoin Cash's propaganda of being the original Bitcoin even though it's not followed by any node that followed BTC before August 1st and it has a minority hashrate and smaller price (which means smaller demand since the supply is very similar).

BCH is a fork to recover Bitcoin original characteristics. 

It is BTC that changes.

>I'd respect it more if one of the hard-forks prevented covert ASIC Boost from being used, but that's clearly not in the interest of the guy that currently controls 50% of the hashrate of BCH.

Funny, segwit will be the only chain with ASICBOOST working.

Doesnt work like that. In order for mining to work and reach consensus everyone needs to have the same block size

And please use your brain for once: the price would be much higher than it is now if people are willing to pay more...

This is what they should have done: give users their BCH and notify them. Then announce trading will go live in 24 hours and allow people to start entering limit orders building up a real order book. Not this fake order book.

I can’t believe you’re still denying this.
Also, GDAX is shady as fuck. They have literally stolen $2,000 from me. I sent them a bank wire on 10/16/17 and they as of today have still not processed it and credited my GDAX balance. Been back and forth with their support but they won't tell me what the issue is, just to be more patient.

Not necessarily good.

"**Insider trading**

Insider trading is the trading of a public company's stock or other securities (such as bonds or stock options) by individuals with access to nonpublic information about the company. In various countries, some kinds of trading based on insider information is illegal. This is because it is seen as unfair to other investors who do not have access to the information, as the investor with insider information could potentially make larger profits than a typical investor could make.

The authors of one study claim that illegal insider trading raises the cost of capital for securities issuers, thus decreasing overall economic growth.

"> The fact that Satoshi Nakamoto has some view of what Bitcoin is and is not

Satoshi invented the original Bitcoin, which no longer exists.  He open sourced his code, and now many projects implement the Bitcoin idea and protocol as described in the white paper.  Some of them incorporate the name Bitcoin, some do not.

> He wrote the white paper. BTC is not what is described as Bitcoin. BCH is.

That is factually incorrect.

> straw man argument

That is not correct either.  You explicitly said that you found it acceptable to cause inconvenience and hassle to new users for the sake of the name.  Pointing out that you said that and then explaining why that's a bad thing is not remotely a straw man argument.

> Straight blockstream propaganda. Blockstream/core tell us that if you raise the block size today, Bitcoin is somehow doomed tomorrow because it can't compete on Visa level transactions today.

The white paper does not mention a block size.  That is a fact.  If you're going to use the white paper to defend your idea of what Bitcoin is, then I'm perfectly free to use it to counter your claims.

Just because something doesn't align with your views does not make it propaganda.  I never said that I agreed with keeping the blocksize small.  All I claimed is that a larger blocksize is not de facto ""more Bitcoin"" than a smaller block size.

> [Lots of Satoshi quotes about bandwidth and nodes]

There's a few points to bring up.  The first and most obvious one is that Satoshi's speculations about the future aren't technical specs and weren't implemented.  The white paper and the source code provide the defition of Bitcoin, and not even Satoshi himself gets to redefine what Bitcoin is.  If Satoshi came out of hiding tomorrow and said Bitcoin  should be more centralized and like Paypal and there should only be 2 nodes, run by governments, guess what... nobody would do that or call his vision Bitcoin.  Because it's no longer his to define.  Like art or any other work, once it's released, it's out of the author's control and hands.  ""Bitcoin"" is whatever the community defines it as.  Nobody, not even Satoshi, and not even you, gets to declare that their vision is the correct vision and Bitcoin is only what they say it is.

Second point: There are valid security concerns relating to blocksize -- all the standard things Core says may be tired and annoying to hear, but they are valid arguments.  It is also valid to claim that the blocksize is part of the scarcity of Bitcoin.  Just because your or I happen to disagree with all those arguments doesn't in itself negate them.  Those visions and views of what Bitcoin is are just as valid as yours.  If you're using the white paper as your definition, as you seem to be, then as I pointed out previously (numerous times), there's nothing that says 1mb blocks can't be Bitcoin.  They certainly have been for the first 8 years.

I forget what my third point was, but the above two will suffice.  The community defines what Bitcoin is, not you and not Satoshi.  And even if we go by the white paper, it doesn't mention any of the stuff you posted.  George Lucas may get to rewrite his works, but Satoshi does not."
No it's not BCH is bitcoins ticker. BTC is bitcoin core ticker.
Pragmatism =/= animosity
"> ~~The fact that you personally have some view of what Bitcoin is and is not, and what chain should and should not call themselves ""Bitcoin"" is entirely your own problem.~~

The fact that Satoshi Nakamoto has some view of what Bitcoin is and is not, and what chain should and should not call themselves ""Bitcoin"" is entirely his own problem.

fixed that for you

He wrote the white paper.
BTC is not what is described as Bitcoin.
BCH is.

that's all there is to it

> When somebody says ""fuck the users, we're doing things this way"",

straw man argument

No one is saying F the users.  You could make a valid case that by selling people BTC when they want to buy what Bitcoin was 3 years ago is misleading new investors.  Actually, that is happening on a huge scale and it happens every day.

> The Bitcoin of the white paper says nothing about block size,

Straight blockstream propaganda.  Blockstream/core tell us that if you raise the block size today, Bitcoin is somehow doomed tomorrow because it can't compete on Visa level transactions today.

""Long before the network gets anywhere near as large as that, it would be safe 
for users to use Simplified Payment Verification (section 8) to check for 
double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or 
about 12KB per day.  **Only people trying to create new coins would need to run 
network nodes.  At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the 
network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to 
specialists with server farms of specialized hardware.  A server farm would 
only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with 
that one node.**

""The bandwidth might not be as prohibitive as you think.  A typical transaction 
would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact).  Each transaction has to be 
broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction.  Visa processed 37 billion 
transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day.  
That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or 
2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices.

**""If the network were to get that big, it would take several years, and by then, 
sending 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a big deal.""**

i'm not a shill, seems to be a common thing to call anyone who likes BTC here a shill or troll.
">forced it to use the BCH/BCC ticker

not sure what you mean forced, this sub spent ages deciding between whether they wanted BCH or BCC. since using BTC would be incorrect as that is Bitcoins Ticker"
"> anyone fighting it is just trying to find ANY reason to preserve some BTC value
"
I care about the *users*.
"You're absolutely right that BCH is Bitcoin.

But so is the Legacy chain.

The fact that you personally have some view of what Bitcoin is and is not, and what chain should and should not call themselves ""Bitcoin"" is entirely your own problem.

The Bitcoin of the white paper says nothing about block size, or about extension protocols.  Your views on those topics is not some official cannon that everybody else must recognize.  Both BCH and BTC have just as much right to call themselves Bitcoin as any other coin does.  (Or rather, as much right as any other PoW coin does....)

> No one is demanding anything

It sure sounded like it when somebody said that calling the legacy chain Bitcoin was ""the wrong path"" and that ""the right thing"" was calling BCH Bitcoin, and we should do that even at the expense of users.

When somebody says ""fuck the users, we're doing things this way"", most people consider that pretty darned close to a demand."
"Ok, troll then.  If you go to r/bitcoin and say BTC is Corecoin, you'll get flat banned and your post deleted.

Here, we have freedom to speak our minds.  Posting leading troll statements makes your a troll or a shill.

Post like that, get called what you are.

Now, had you come along and said, ""In my opinion, Bitcoin cash is not Bitcoin and here is why,"" then we could have an intelligent conversation.  That's what reasonable people do.  

People who do what you did are shills or trolls."

Anyone calling bitcoin cash “bitcoin” is just trying to sow confusion.
[deleted]
I can't find one mention of this over at r/bitcoin. Am I blind or is the censorship that crazy now?
Bitcoin Cash? More like Chadcoin Cash - this coin fucks.
"Calling Bitcoin Cash just Bitcoin only serves to create confusion. If you really don't want Core to have the Bitcoin moniker, just use Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Legacy, or something like that.  But using just ""Bitcoin"" when everybody else in the world understands that to mean the Legacy chain, will only create confusion.  I know BCH wants to appropriate the Bitcoin name, but you just can't force social movements.  Call Core the legacy chain if you want, but don't needlessly create confusion."
That is one bold message. Incredibly incissive, love it
This made my month.  
Wow.
">we will refer to Bitcoin Cash as Bitcoin only.

but why? that's false information."
"It actually is a fork, because Core forked out many things that we had used for payments, designed for the payments development path.

It's not merely that Core failed to raise the blocksize, they ALSO forked out zero-config and forked in RBF, they forked out multiple op-codes and replaced them with nothing, and by refusing to fork they have allowed the fees to balloon out of control, in a way that bitcoin was never intended to be expensive to transact with. Satoshi applied the 1mb limit early on, it was NEVER meant to be a hard-limit never to be changed, and he expected the blocksize to be raised continually. To refuse to fork is to betray his intent and purpose in creating that limit in the first place."
If I understand this correctly, I need to buy some Bitcoin Cash. Would someone be so good as to suggest a reliable wallet? I would like a second opinion before I commit to one.
Huge sea change just started
Boom! Wow that’s an awesome message they posted. Roasted!!!
If they retire BItcoin support how are we going to make fun of the fees paid for transactions?

"Here is the message:

> In August 2017, Bitcoin forked into two variants. These have taken radically different paths.

> Looking at the situation one quarter later, it is clear to us that the Blockstream fork of bitcoin diverges so radically from the ideas presented in the Bitcoin white paper, that it is an evolutionary dead end. While it may still have high trading value, as a mere collectible of curiosity, the Blockstream fork of bitcoin is not part of building any future financial infrastructure, which is what Block Explorer is about.

> A currency of the future has subcent optional usage fees and instant transactions. The Blockstream fork of Bitcoin (""Bitcoin Legacy"") is at $20 usage fees and rising, with no end in sight, and can take days to confirm, despite unfulfilled promises to the contrary on both points when Segwit activated in what can only be described as a community fistfight. We are therefore making the decision to consider the Blockstream fork deprecated, and support it as legacy technology only.

> Rather, we have made the decision to support the only bitcoin fork with a postive utility momentum, which is Bitcoin Cash. We took an early decision to deploy a Bitcoin Cash block explorer and will continue to roll out related services. We are also deploying tools for other cryptocurrencies we find on a positive momentum path, such as ZCash, which have increased privacy value.

> We will not add future support for the Blockstream fork of bitcoin (""Bitcoin Legacy""), and will be deprecating it entirely at some future point in time to be determined. Developments have revealed it to be a dead end. At such a time, we will refer to Bitcoin Cash as Bitcoin only, but will make some effort to not break API calls by changing URLs of legacy automated systems.

I honestly agree with you here!! 
"but, its not

How is it false information? Why should 1 fork get the name over the other fork? It's an open source project.
"anyone fighting it is just trying to find ANY reason to preserve some BTC value

It will flip in time.  It is inevitable."
Confusing the real Bitcoin for the real Bitcoin? How does that work?
yup, right up there with cross breeding leprechauns and unicorns
"You're not blind. and it's not ""now"", it's been for a long time, now just so far past the point of unmistakable that it's absurd."
"Sure does!

Because something takes a little more work we should take the wrong path?  No.  You do the right thing.  If new folks have to do a little more reading, so be it.
Ya, the time to have done this was immediately post fork. Its too late now.
To clear up the confusion, BCH should be called Bitcoin and BTC should be called BSettle to better reflect the other chain’s new stated purpose. 
"The worst thing that could happen is that uneducated people using Block Explorer (really?) confuse the real Bitcoin for the real Bitcoin...

This comment reeks of concern trolling."
