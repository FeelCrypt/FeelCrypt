"dude. it already happened years ago. the admins even fomented a little rebellion using reddit's large base of toxic trolls against Pao to kick her out. the community self pwned. when the users now cry out to her to save the communities, she whispers ""no.""  Pao has last laugh. cue music."
"What the fuck are you talking about?   Do you know how stupid you sound?

"
"You don't get it.  Its not about ""being the real bitcoin"".  Geez, you are stupid.

Its about Bitcoin.  Bitcoin Cash.  Fuck.  You haven't caught up, have you?  You are ill-informed."
"> Perhaps the top priority for the Bitcoin Cash community should be to find a replacement for reddit. It doesn't have to be fully peer to peer or decentralised, but a forum which had a different approach to community moderation might be a help.

A system called Politeia is being built to replace Reddit.

Communication software suitable for serious open governance process must satisfy requirements I covered in detail [here](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/ZcashFoundation/issues/58#issuecomment-368159053), but briefly: protect integrity and authenticity of messages, resist (silent) censorship and prevent spam.

In short, Politeia is Git anchored to blockchain, hence expensive to rewrite, easy to replicate and verify. Moderation has provable censorship. For every post you get a ""censorship token"" that you can use to publicly prove you've been censored. Additional spam protection is done by requiring tiny payment to create account and post.

The design is not fully decentralized, only the critical bits. I find it quite pragmatic, it allows to get something working with minimum P2P challenges and is ""good enough"" to bootstrap governance process that is still a huge improvement over vanilla Reddit. End goal is to decentralize control of project fund and disburse according to holder vote.

Relevant for Bitcoin Cash is that it is coin-agnostic (Decred stuff is plugin). Further, parts can be reused to allow broader application of the concept of versioned and timestamped data.

Current state: storage and anchoring done, paywall in testing, coin voting in development. [Test version](https://test-proposals.decred.org/) is running with CLI and Reddit-looking GUI.

It amazing you literally identify the same issues that motivated btcsuite/Decred developers in 2013-2015."
this is everywhere haha but good it needs to be publicized
the sub exists, who knows why
"I'd say that because 12 years of indoctrination in government schools persuades many people that businesses and markets are a kind of evil bogeyman that we need to be ""protected"" from.

Even when they start to wake up to the injustices done by governments and their misleading propaganda efforts, that firmly-planted pin takes a while to fall. It is a false ""truth"" that they have been made to recant since they were very small.

That was the case for me, anyway."
I'm just bring up the fact that people like you who support btc-core tend to be very ignorant on the subjects you speak so loudly about. 
yes, i would hazard a guess that i am less ignorant than most.
