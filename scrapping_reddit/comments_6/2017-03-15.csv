"It does seem like a strange coincidence that the attack happens the day after a small group of core supporters went on overdrive to attack BU at r/bitcoin and twitter (as pointed out [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5z8ynv/does_this_mean_my_comment_was_deleted_at_rbitcoin/dew85zg/)).

nullc was very active in those threads, and today he's back at r/btc after a long break. Instead of distancing himself from such behavior, he's using it. I wouldn't be surprised if he orchestrated this attack on the Bitcoin network. 

Fortunately you can't attack a good idea."
Ultimately Peter's tweet served no purpose but to highlight the exploit before the hotfix was available. How is that not irresponsible? Sure you can argue that it was exposed in the dev branch of their Git, but just because its publicly *accessible*, doesnt make it a public *announcement*.

_On July 29 2010, it was discovered that block 71036 contained several transactions with a ton of OP_CHECKSIG commands. There should only ever be one such command. This caused every node to do extra unnecessary work, and it **could have been used as a denial-of-service attack**. A new version of Bitcoin was quickly released. The new version did not cause a fork on the main network, though it did cause one on the test network_

_On August 15 2010, it was discovered that block 74638 contained a transaction that created over 184 billion bitcoins for two different addresses._"
"How was I unclear?

The correction was put in the code, Peter noticed, decided to broadcast that BU was broken to the world **before the patch could be implemented**. How are developers supposed to fix something quietly when Peter is calling it out on Twitter quite loudly before they release the fix? 

Does Peter just watch BU commits for fun? He certainly didn't try to actually help fix the issue, and instead openly promoted an attack vector in the same hour it was being corrected, which is highly unethical. 

Doublethink/doublespeak never ends with you, does it. "
There is a war going on and the commonly used weapon is dirty tricks. Both sides are using them.  But Core is losing its power. Just look at Bitcoin Dominance on Coinmarketcap.com.  Core and BU will scorch the earth to the extent they can as Bitcoin withers. Regardless, Bitcoin is serial number one and serial number ones never survive.  They may be used for a time, but they always yield to exponentially superior invention. I am enjoying the view of the house burning while the people inside fight to the death. I am sick, I know.
Wrong.
Alternative implementations: BU, Classic, XT.
Yes, Core's fight against multiple implementations is doomed.
Bitcoin is no democracy where the majority overrules the minority
Democracy is a pretty terrible idea in most forms.
I don't think the public announcement of a bug in a client for a prospective Bitcoin network warrants legal action.  My comment was in regards to actions taken against the network as a whole.  Criminal action like theft should still be prosecuted.
"> criminals

that's a legal term depending on jurisdiction.

I think we should each apply our own moral standards (and live by them).

This misbehaviour (in my and probably your eyes and those of many others, I hope) is a chance to weaken these peoples standing with the community if played right (made transparent).

">What i would disapprove is to counter attack them and Bitcoin Core using the same methods.

if we're going to argue that law enforcement should not get involved (i agree) and that these types of attacks are ok (like ddos, TM attacks, and now this), then i think the same counterattacks against core should be fair game."
Because classic crashed for me too.
Completely agree. Running Bitcoin Unlimited is not something you *accidentally* do.
I'm sure I've seen some childish /r/btc ads recently lol.

"> This occurred way before Todds tweet , also you have to keep in mind that the attacker still needs to write the PoC exploit as well.

The PoC code looks super basic though, I think a decent coder could have written it within a few minutes."
"> This occurred way before Todds tweet

No those comments followed the first posting of PT's tweet by 2 hours."
Considering the BU devs themselves informed everyone on a public channel, I'm not sure this is a relevant question at all.
Quit playing dumb.
I was asking if BU was playing trump in his example. Not that they equated to each other. No need to read too far into things. 
"This error should not have made it into production (software has bugs but this one was sloppy). Go ahead and blame a Core supporter (or ""elements within Core"", whatever that means) for attacking BU if that makes you feel better. If you run a BU node, you should be more interested in seeing necessary changes to the peer review and big handling processes, not ranting about ""Core"" attacking BU. Ranting is a waste of energy (unless, I suppose, you have nothing else to offer)."

Attackers will always exist. Blaming them is like blaming the weather. They just need to be accepted as part of the environment. If you build a house where there are harsh winters, and don't sufficiently insulate it, you blame the builder, not the weather. The builder knew they were building in a hostile environment and if they missed a spot, fix it and learn from the mistake.
The issue is that the bugs were not caught during peer review. The BU and Classic teams are small and lack proper review. I am sure the coders are not bad, but without testing and review bugs will keep happening.
">So BU disclosing bugs in private, and not exploiting similar bugs

Just because many nodes went down at close to the same time doesnt mean that the nodes were in the same IP range. Its possible, but its equally possible that the attacker simply had a list of unrelated BU nodes that he had connected to in the past and was ready to target.
"Well, 8 nodes were mine.    And they're globally distributed.   But the fact that we have nodecounters to see how many nodes is exactly because they're all publicly accessible.   BU nodes which were not connecting directly to the network (as probably is the case with nodes used by large mining pools) would not be affected.   The hash rate of BU blocks didn't do what the (public) node count did.

This kind of thing is a nuisance.   Worse case you get a page in the middle of the night like I did and have to deal with it.  Some service disruption, but no direct financial loss.

If core ever has a bug like this, those nodes could be taken down just as quickly.
As for the 30%, likely they had restart scripts.    The person who ran the attack  may not have run it repeatedly.   And now that the fix is out I expect it to return to normal."
"Uh, no, you wouldn't have to loop through every possible IP. They're simply all listed here: [https://bitnodes.21.co/nodes/]

And the fact that some nodes didn't go down just means that they're either running a version which is old enough to not have this exploit, or they aren't running BU at all, and simply faked their user agent to report it as BU without actually running the BU code."
I am sorry that you think this. I run a BU node and am a hardcore BTC supporter and also holder since 2011, everytime I read something like this it makes me sad. Imho all the blocksize increase attempts are just expressions of (at least a part) the market who wants this. It sucks greatly that this needs a HF but if sucessfull we could be much better off (and crush some altcoins value).
"Y.. y.. you mean a voluntary network fork of dissatisfied users and miners as intended by the idea of a decentralized network?

How is this much cognitive dissonance possible, that there are now Bitcoiners who support **decentralisation** but think voluntarily choosing a different client is ""attacking"" the network?  This is literally 2+2=5 type thinking."
"It's true it does address the quadratic scaling, but only for the witness space. And as I understand it this is limited in size because the other part of it still can't exceed the 1MB limit (else it is not backward compatible anymore to old nodes). So there seems to be a ceiling to the way the space can be increased that way.

Afaik BU also has user configurable sigops limit and a limit on the max size of a transaction, maybe this is already enough to workaround this quadratic scaling issue.

I would be okay with it if segwit activates, I would make my node compatible with it. But I have to say I am pretty skeptical this is a good way to increase the blocksize. It has weird side effects, the max size is 4MB but can only use around 2MB, that seems strange. Also I really do not like switching to blockweight and having a 75% discount set as default on segwit transactions.

But it is up to the miners at the moment, and so far it seems they do not like it. In the bloomberg article the antpool guy said this:
>Wu added that miners like him have refused to adopt SegWit because he doesnâ€™t see his economic interests aligning with what is proposed by the technology.

I wish segwit would only segregate the transactions and signatures and not increase the blocksize in a strange way :) But maybe it could still activate like it is (with miners and not UASF) if the core devs would commit to a real blocksize increase asap afterwards, that maybe also removes the weird side effects again. But I have not much hope for this.

Sorry wall of text -_-"

"They didn't censor it. Everything (and I mean everything) is time-stamped. You are free to believe what you like, but your statement is simply not true.

Beyond that, however, Gavin Andresen has been encouraging devs to mount an attack against Core. Roger Ver and Jihan Wu are actively ""lobbying"" Chinese miners, and have called for the removal of Core. They have spent millions on this campaign. It is hostile, manipulative propaganda whose sole purpose is to create an OPEC-style oligopoly. It would destroy Bitcoin.

So who, exactly, has mounted an attack on whom? And even if Core did ""withhold"" information (which they didn't), how on earth can anyone blame them for defending themselves against the malicious hostility mounted by Gavin, Roger, and Jihan? And so many others.

Bitcoin Unlimited is dead, and this hypocrisy typifies why. You are in a boat full of incompetent devs and even less competent propagandists. My sincerest hope is that you all start another project (since you have numbers, quality, and momentum on your side, right?), or leave crypto en masse.

Usual disclaimer: I defy moderators to leave this post up so that the world can read and respond to it. Because r/btc doesn't ""censor."" Am I right?

Hell, let's face it: you guys can't even use the word ""censorship"" in its correct form. North Korea practices censorship. Reddit does not practice censorship. I know you think if you just keep repeating it, it will be true. But it won't.

To have diversity you have to have compatibility. BU is incompatible with other clients if used as intended.

"not saying about the robustness of having multiple clients, just take a look at the exploit script http://pastebin.com/xsZEnZJ3

To simulate the attack, one has to loop through every single IP. If they managed to take down so many nodes at once, it might mean one IP/ IP range hosted many nodes. which is why I said this looks centralized.

Unless all node IPs were exposed, which doesn't make sense as 30% still standing strong.

Correct me if I'm wrong. I'm neutral in this topic."

"uhm segwit addresses this issue and without it a blocksize increase is reckless

Linear scaling of sighash operations

A major problem with simple approaches to increasing the Bitcoin blocksize is that for certain transactions, signature-hashing scales quadratically rather than linearly.

Linear versus quadratic

In essence, doubling the size of a transaction increases can double both the number of signature operations, and the amount of data that has to be hashed for each of those signatures to be verified. This has been seen in the wild, where an individual block required 25 seconds to validate, and maliciously designed transactions could take over 3 minutes.

Segwit resolves this by changing the calculation of the transaction hash for signatures so that each byte of a transaction only needs to be hashed at most twice. This provides the same functionality more efficiently, so that large transactions can still be generated without running into problems due to signature hashing, even if they are generated maliciously or much larger blocks (and therefore larger transactions) are supported."

If you can't understand how drawing public attention to a bug before that bug has a patch available is irresponsible, I can't help your delusion. In response to Todd's BS, BU devs have posted evidence of them disclosing bugs responsibly to Core, not highlighting them on twitter and gloating, so no despite your claims, this destructive behavior is not mutual.
I'll second that - we do have some erudite people in this community.

2. Announce the bug to the world so that someone can exploit it before the fix is implemented.

He was surprised, as anyone rightfully should be, that such a serious bug existed in the BU system.  And then considering that this was pushed *live* onto the network over a year ago, if this situation is somehow ""irresponsible,"" then I can only expect the same excuse if this happened to the entire bitcoin system.  That excuses would be made, and it would be ""the community's fault"" for talking about when major problems are found in the code.  Discussion of Peter's tweet is an absolute dodge from talking about the actual bug, its consequences, and the reality that it reveals.  

If we are trying to call something ""irresponsible,"" How about publicly releasing untested code, berating and demeaning the core devs for ""untested SegWit,"" screaming endlessly about ""Core killing Bitcoin,"" repeating nonsense conspiracies of ""bank takeovers,"" throwing endless personal attacks, and then *blaming someone else* for network-shutdown level mistakes?

"Nodes were already crashing before the tweet was made. If BU devs cared about the exploit being used for a while before people updated they shouldn't have made the fixes public like they did.

>Imagine if Ford found a bug which allowed remote activation of airbags through a spoofable radio signal, and issues a recall. GM hears about it, and publicizes the exploit to all of its engineers and fanboys, so that they can make airbags pop in cars that have not yet been upgraded.

The analogy fails because BU devs themselves made the issue public. If Ford had talked about the issue and how to cause the crash in public, meaning potential exploiters already had access to it, I wouldn't blame GM for tweeting as a warning to people not to drive until updated."
"The consumer would see searching for who was more to blame for the exploitation of the exploit as futile, but also as less significant than the realization that no other company's products had comparable faults.

Thats why that never happens. Bc once your brand's car is the only one with the airbag problem, your brand becomes strongly associated with that problem. It doesn't matter who pointed out the problem any more than the identities of all the individuals who actually exploited the problem. What matters is if there are brands out there who's cars never allowed for this exploit bc maybe their airbags are mechanical or theres some kinda closed circuit dealy yada yada.

Not saying thats the way it *should* be. But that is indeed the way that that would play out.

Also anyone could easily obscure the source of the leak."
"This is par for the course in computer security. A constant struggle for patching windows is the fact that as soon as a patch is released that patch is reverse engineered and the unpatched systems are quickly exploited. Microsoft mitigates this by having known patch schedules so that people in charge of maintaining windows systems know when the patches are coming out and can get them installed quickly.

This issue did reveal that BU needs a better process for quickly releasing patches. And a private channel to discuss vulnerabilities before the fixes are publicly available on github.

Something like an announcement that a DOS vulnerability has been discovered and patched binaries and source code will be released simultaneously at a specific time. Then people running nodes can prepare for and install the updates as soon as attackers have the details of the exploit.

There are lessons to be learned here."

1MB block limit is a threat to the long term survival of bitcoin - removing it has been clouded in FUD - if you research every objection to removing the 1MB limit to its final conclusion you will realize it is not part of the bitcoin design.   

If you find a justification bring it to me I I've heard them all and with deductive reasoning you can see it's just FUD. 


actual it it comes downs risk, everyone has good points so you have to weight them according to desired properties.  the result is <1MB favors more centralized control - >1.1MB - more decentralized control.

It seems the enemies inside the bitcoin community are potentially more dangerous than those on the outside...
"The thing that Peter Todd linked to was the patch being posted by the BU developers that said _exactly_ what it did.

A quiet fix does not do that. 

Again, go find an example like that for the Bitcoin project-- there isn't one.

You cannot assume actually malicious people won't read your commits. You cannot assume that they will quietly hold their hand while you roll out a fix.  Every other major security critical open source project manages to do quiet fixes that don't immediately tip off attackers. 

Fortunately in this case it was just a clean assertion.

> Does Peter just watch BU commits for fun?

I assume he watches them on the off chance the find a vulnerability that effects something that matters. Several times in the past they have (incorrectly) believed they found vulnerabilities in Core and then failed to disclose them in a timely or reasonable manner, and instead attempted to ""weaponize"" them, then kept them quiet until pulling them out in an attack piece (that ultimately made them look stupid, because they were wrong about them...).

"
"Nope. Roger Ver and Jihan Wu have made concerted, expensive attacks on Bitcoin that have failed. You don't like it. You are ready to blame anyone but yourselves.

Bitcoin Unlimited is using 96% of Core's code. the 4% BU created has failed twice. We don't trust you with the network. You're irresponsible, petulant brats. You refuse to take responsibility for your mistakes. You have redefined and abused the word ""censorship"" to the point that it's a joke. 

You're mad. I get it. You wanted to steal the Bitcoin network. I get it. But you failed. Start your own project and leave the rest of us alone."
"Democracy can be defined as ""rule of the majority"". Miners vote on protocol changes in a majority takes all approach that is enforced by the code, so it is a democracy, at least mechanically if we're just talking about that aspect of Bitcoin alone. I am not sure what you mean?"
Oh yes, it was always my hope that blockchains will enable us to come up with something better, or at least create a democratic system that works better

"I don't think you actually know what the word ""exploit"" means in the context of information security.

An exploit is the *actual code* that's written to -- wait for it -- *exploit* a  vulnerability, not the simple disclosure (read: description) of a bug or vulnerability by itself."
Then why not switch to Classic?
"There's a difference between a script kiddy doing it for the lulz and a rival developer who spots the fix when it is merged but not yet released, and then tweets about it.

Imagine if Ford found a bug which allowed remote activation of airbags through a spoofable radio signal, and issues a recall. GM hears about it, and publicizes the exploit to all of its engineers and fanboys, so that they can make airbags pop in cars that have not yet been upgraded.

Would such a disclosure be responsible? Would it be futile to blame the attacker?

Excuse me for my terminology. But in this case its not like an exploit was difficult to derive after the vulnerability has been pointed out to you.
"i remember you paleh0rse from when i first joined

what you are saying is correct & the people downvoting and upvoting the opposite are doing only an emotional vote against any dissenting opinion.

but

people who proclaim loudly regarding a not-yet-patched software bug, know exactly the consequences invite an attack of the vulnerability.

the proper and professional way to handle a serious bug is to do it quietly.

[deleted]
A responsible person, upon detecting a vulnerability, keeps in mind users, not just the authors of the software.
I don't necessarily take it as far as the OP and think its criminal, I'm not a prosecutor so I don't know or care, but its at least ridiculously irresponsible. Obviously a mistake was made by not fixing the bug in a more private repo/more discreetly, but that doesn't excuse Peter Todd for exasperating the situation.
"Substituting the word nation with Bitcoin and this quote by Cicero is fitting:

*Bitcoin can survive its fools, and even the ambitious. But it cannot survive treason from within. An enemy at the gates is less formidable, for he is known and carries his banner openly. But the traitor moves amongst those within the gate freely, his sly whispers rustling through all the alleys, heard in the very halls of government itself. For the traitor appears not a traitor; he speaks in accents familiar to his victims, and he wears their face and their arguments, he appeals to the baseness that lies deep in the hearts of all men. He rots the soul of Bitcoin, he works secretly and unknown in the night to undermine the pillars of the city, he infects the body politic so that it can no longer resist. A murderer is less to fear.*"
"> I assume he watches them on the off chance the find a vulnerability that effects something that matters.

I don't actually; other people contact me when they find this stuff and think it should be publicized more widely. A lot of what I do these days is kinda like journalism actually."
"So because the BU team made a mistake, that excuses Peter from making the situation even worse? You're so disengenous...it's very sad.

No one is arguing that it should. 

>Go ahead and blame a Core supporter (or ""elements within Core"", whatever that means) for attacking BU if that makes you feel better.

I'd refer you to the OP's post.

>If you run a BU node, you should be more interested in seeing necessary changes to the peer review and big handling processes, not ranting about ""Core"" attacking BU.

Back in reality, we realize it's possible to ""rant"" about both. Both are issues that can and should be raised. "
They potentially are, as they have the advantage of peer access to the most current hidden knowledge in the ecosystem.  
The sudden increase in core nodes does seems suspicious...
"The BU devs noticed the attack occurring within 30 min of merge because reports and their test nodes were effected. Bitnodes stats wont be as accurate.

It is the policy of the BUtcoin development team to release their software to the WHOLE WORLD for review (not to just a few hundred reviewers like BlockstreamBacktothefuturePongyangNorthChickCorea.)

The BUtcoin reviewers caught the bug, and tested its vulnerability, which was then shown to potential users.

The system worked.  This was not an attack, it was a successful operation by the BUtcoin Unlimited Loyal Leadership Software Hackability Investigation Team.  "
"It was not an ""orchestrated attack"". Stop the lies, the FUD and the propaganda. When you publish code that was not properly reviewed and had bugs, it's not Core's fault."

"im not a fanboy by any means but the time line of your narrative is just wrong. loosen your tinfoil hat a bit.

 Rather than pointing fingers and getting into a mud slinging contest, it would be better for BU to quickly fix the bug (and test it ffs) and push it up to the proper repos/pkg management in a timely fashion. You want to be taken seriously, being agile, quality controled and efficient is how you do it. "
lol, of course it was orchestrated, 99% of bug exploits are orchestrated.
There was something to attack. Big surprise it got attacked. Lets fix the bug and move on.
the point is, this bug should never have appeared. you get it why? one second having this bug on real network would cause problems.
"Can you post the timings of the Twitter post and the node crash? Because I read yesterday that the attack on BU nodes started **before** Todd's Twitter post, which basically invalidates your entire argument.

Bitcoin has and will be attacked in orchestrated ways. It's just something we all have to live with.

Or another part of the orchestrated attack - to spin up new core nodes to make it *look like* nodes have switched...
Nothing, as long as reddit is making money off ads they don't care 
It is political dirty tricks.  Not criminal.
They overlooked that some people would switch to classic as well. If no people switched to classic, it is extremely unlikely that people genuinely switched to core. 
Any lawyers in the house? u/theymos better watch it. Perhaps a civil case might find him liable for damages. That would put a dent in his blockstream paycheck.
I'll take an open source digital war over *actual* war any day.  If this is what the future of seriously contentious arguments looks like then we are the luckiest generation to ever live :)
But Peter Todd only posted about it on Twitter _after_ the code was put on BU's github repo.
"I am not saying that in bad faith - I'm agnostic concerning the block size debate - but the why or who of the attack doesn't matter. In the real world you don't get to say that the exploit doesn't count because you found it first. The attack happened, it's all that matter. If BU was the reference client, it could have been bad.

Well they care about doxing because allowing it would make them liable.

If so, maybe they should start caring

They're confused. A threat to their control over the code base is not an attack on bitcoin."
"It's not a coincidence. When you post a fix with the most stupid comment ever ""Fixing exploit"" you can wait for it that someone will use it!
Besides that, the code should have been tested and that bug should never been in there. It's the second mayor bug on a short time. That's not good!"

To be fair, I don't see any exploit in the tweet from Todd.
"Interesting that [~200 BU nodes all switched to Core 0.14.0 simultaneously](https://i.imgur.com/QmhGwhE.png). A large Bitcoin-based business?

The attack starts at 5:30 (in the graph's timezone), knocking about 500 nodes off the network (labelled ""other""), then BU 1.0.1.1 nodes slowly start coming online, but at 9:30 there's a sudden 200 node increase in Core 0.14.0 without a decrease anywhere else - probably nodes that were knocked out by the attack and are controlled by one entity which switched to Core. 

([graph source](https://bitnodes.21.co/dashboard/) - resolution is every 30 minutes)"
I've said this before. They will lie, cheat and steal in order to stay in power.

Who cares if it was a coordinated attack?  The fact is the exploit was enabled by BU dev's incompetence -- this is what people should care about.  
Still, it was very naive of the BU developers to not expect such an attack.

"When you say ""orchestrated,"" do you mean ""orchestrated"" like Jihan Wu and Roger Ver throwing millions at the campaign to create an OPEC-style oligopoly? Roger even said to Bloomberg last week that he is ""lobbying"" in China.

There was no ""orchestrated"" attack against BU - by Core or anyone else. BU ""borrowed"" 96% of its codebase from Bitcoin Core. The 4% that BU added is so broken that it has failed twice - this time so badly it brought down all its nodes. But even if there was an ""attack,"" (which is easily disestablished), why would anyone in the BU camp complain, considering the resources that have been systematically spent to destroy Core? Bitcoin Unlimited has been running a calculated and malicious campaign from the beginning. This thread so elegantly typifies the hypocrisy that defines Bitcoin Unlimited.

BU sounds like the cult of Chavez / Maduro, blaming anyone but themselves for their own flawed ideas. Now, more than ever, Bitcoin Unlimited should fork and become an altcoin. If BU is so wonderful, and it has the numbers, and the tech is so far superior to Core's, then go. You will prove us all wrong, won't you?

Even with all the other stuff (segwit lightning etc etc) it would still be needed (opening/closing channels needs to work reliable). Why the holdup and not increase it now, I don't think it would get easier if we wait longer.

I wish segwit would concentrate on segregating the signatures and not trying to be a suboptimal blocksize increase workaround, then it would likely be activated already and we could have blocksize increase AND segwit.. But noooo lol.

It was the Bitcoin Unlimited code that was broken. How is that the fault of Core?
soooo....BU is Trump in your eyes?
BU had a pretty serious bug. Not sure what to tell you. Yes, it sucks that it was exploited _before being fixed_, but it was there and it could have been exploited yesterday or the day before or last week, etc. Blaming the attackers - or blaming the whole of the Core supporting community - is entirely the wrong reaction.

Why? Out concern of BU reputation?
"> No he didn't. He posted a link to BU's disclosure with a WTF.

Yes, with the pure intention of causing trouble. He knew BU devs were patching it at that moment because that is how he found out in the first place. He decided to then make a spectacle of it before the hotfix was released hours later. I cannot think of any reason to do this except being deliberately harmful to the heath of the whole network. 

 Pretty shady, and very unprofessional.

"It would be a waste of time. The whole thing would be very confusing to any investigator (who has what rights, what jurisdiction did things take place in, etc). Even if all that stuff got sorted out, the damages are pretty minor... 

Basically, it was an act of vandalism with hard-to-gauge damages across hundreds of anonymous victims in different jurisdictions. 

Anything criminal with this action itself is a non-starter. 

Now, if some communications could be uncovered that show Blockstream employees planning the attack together, then a charge of criminal conspiracy could possibly be made, in a single jurisdiction. "

"I disagree.  Private processes encourage centralization: who is allowed to see?  Who decides?  Open is best.  Sure, bad actors have the same access, but if we are to be decentralized, we must withhold judgement until they've proven to be bad actors, and then who decides?

If you want to gather a team that will make processes as private as possible, you have to be careful because the open process that suffers from bad actors may end up rejecting your results."
"> All you've demonstrated is that BU release announcements are in rbitcoin's automod; which they probably have been forever since posting it is against the rules there.

Are you saying it will be approved and allowed to be posted there once the mods see it?"
We live outside of their system to a large extent.  That cuts both ways.  My view is if it requires authority intervention, we're doing something wrong.

"As I understand it, Core's build system (inherited by BU) enables asserts in production, so this bug could have been introduced by anyone in either project who was not aware of that particular quirk[1]. To avoid this sort of problem, Core's strategy seems to be to do protracted reviews[2]. Hopefully this crisis will be an incentive for the BU build to diverge from the Core build to something more idiotproof.

I'm with you, a little more proof, a little less conjecture would be nice.
Exactly right, this simple exploit should never have been there to begin with. This is like the current [Struts exploit CVE-2017-5638](https://arstechnica.com/security/2017/03/in-the-wild-exploits-ramp-up-against-high-impact-sites-using-apache-struts/) plaguing the internet right now although the consequences not quite as malicious with the BU exploit. You might find it before anybody else does but unfortunately it takes significantly longer for the community to react and update than it does for others to take advantage of the bug. It should never have been there to begin with. It's unfortunate others within the community took advantage of the situation but it could have just as easily been third party actors and next time it could be outsiders with significantly more nefarious intentions. You can't go around blaming them for bad code that was supposed to be reviewed before the PR was approved. I wish I could blame bugs found in my production code on those who reported it but in reality not only is it my fault but also the fault of othersâ€‹ who missed the bug doing code review.

> you work for a venture capital funded startup called blockstream

I co-founded Blockstream.

> blockstream is funded in part from money, now with controlling interest, from the Bilderberg ""club""

No. Blockstream employees own a controlling interest in the company.  And the ""Bildererg"" connection that rbtc makes noise about is that the insurance company which is the parent company of the parent company of one of our investors, had a prior CEO that was involved with it. Connections to bilderberg apply to damn near [everything](http://i.imgur.com/qV3YJEX.jpg).

By the way, blathering on about Bilderberg just makes you sound like a racist, since it mostly goes with anti-jewish ranting.

> blockstream employs a large fraction, probably a majority of the now ""core"" bitcoin developers

Blockstream employs _TWO_ regular contributors to Bitcoin Core-- myself and another person, and a couple other people that contribute less frequently.  The last release of Bitcoin Core named 100 contributors, seven of whom work or have contracted for Blockstream. And sure, many of the hundred contributors made only one or two contributions that release but that is also true for many of the Blockstream people.

We created Blockstream in part because effectively no one was providing funding for Bitcoin infrastructure work... so I'm happy to say that we've been able to do some of that and help keep Bitcoin healthy and improving.

> the primary business of blockstream is to build an off-chain payment network called lightning network

No, we have absolutely no business plans for lightning on Bitcoin.  Lightning is a minor project currently supported by two employees because we know that in the long term we'll tools need high volume systems.  It's all open source, it was someone elses proposal that we contribute to. I have no idea how we could monetize it and we we don't have any plans to do so.

> which is a for-profit service that will generate private revenue to this company

Lightning is a fully peer to peer system that uses Bitcoin transactions, beyond tech support and things like that, I'm not aware of any way to monetize it.

> the only effective way LN systems work is to implement segwit

Lightning doesn't need segwit, though current implementations have been setup to expect it because segwit removes a lot of technical debt from Bitcoin and makes it much easier to work with. Segwit hadn't even been proposed when lightning was proposed.

> increasing block size now to 2, 4 or 8mb (or at all) reduces the need for a separate payment network like LN

It [does nothing to change the need for lightning](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/438hx0/a_trip_to_the_moon_requires_a_rocket_with/). 8MB or whatever doesn't even get within three orders of magnitude of the scale required for large scale retail usage of bitcoin.  Also, Lightning is not a separate payment network, lightning uses Bitcoin transactions for every operation.

Excessive increases in the blocksize may, however, destroy Bitcoin's decentralization and render it too insecure to build higher layer systems like lightning.

>  increasing to 2,4 or 8 mb is possible right now (many tests and data show this, I've seen them)

Then why don't you link them?  You are lying or confused-- no such test shows that or can show that. There are tests that show that over 4MB is not safe (toomim, cornell) and over 2MB is not safe (bitfury), while only considering a subset of concerns (e.g. block propagation, and ignoring synchronization impacts). No study shows a particular level is safe, nor can one-- and there is evidence that the current 1MB level is not particularly safe.

Segwit however, addresses some of the risks and ignores the rest and increases the effective blocksize to 2MB.

>  but core has not implemented larger blocks primarily because doing so conflicts with blockstream business priorities

This makes no sense, and opposition to cranking up the blocksize existed long before blockstream was ever imagined. Bitcoin Core is a community of a great many contributors, the vast majority of whom have nothing to do with blockstream, and _NONE_ of whom have ever said anything supporting your conspiracy theories.

Moreover, Core _has_ implemented larger blocks in a completely compatible and non-disruptive manner.

> moreover, segwit is inordinately complex, trying to solve for a problem we do not have, and will require all future implementations of bitcoin clients to carry with it the overhead of segwit implementations - which only makes sense if you buy into making off chain systems to process transactions

Segwit eliminates a lot of technical debt and makes Bitcoin much easier to deal with. Segwit itself is relatively simple, and it has been extensively tested and reviewed for roughly a year now.  The issues that it resolves are real issues that impact bitcoin's usage and degrade its scalablity.
