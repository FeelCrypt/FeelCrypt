Can someone with a lot of twitter followers post this link to bring attention to this gigantic display of petty insecurity from the mods?

The Nazis were using these techniques long before they started WWII or the concentration camps. The price of freedom is vigilance.
I agree. Core look more like a bunch of Bolshevicks.  
It's the same state of consciousness. The intolerance of the free will of others the attempt to control it the appeal to authority the denial of the individual. If the social environment was different and allowed for physical control and they had power to excersice it they would indeed have no qualms about doing that.

Fair enough!
What? That's why the BCH users are using bch. There's no secret btc destruction plan in there, or a statement of who I think is right, just an answer to your question
"Core have spread missinformation around centralization. Trying to make people believe the word means something it doesnt.

https://diglife.com/content/images/2017/08/network_types_simplified.png

there you can see, from left to right, a centralized, a decentralized, and a distributed network.

Keeping block size small keeps the network more DISTRIBUTED, not decentralized. bigger blocks means less people can run full nodes making the network look more like the image in the center, a DECENTRALIZED NETWORK. Those who can run full nodes keep the network decentralized. It would only be centralized if suddendly all nodes were controlled by one party, which is absurd when you have people all around the world running full BCH nodes, its impossible for one party to own the majority of them.

"
Yeah, I wonder why someone would do that...
I hate this conspiracy theory post-hoc rationalisation crap. If Craig Wright wanted people to think he wasn’t Satoshi Nakamoto, the simplest thing he could have done was **not publicly claim to be Satoshi Nakamoto**. No-one suspected him until he began trying to convince them. The idea that he was throwing people off his trail - after yelling and shouting “hey, come over here to this trail” - is retarded.
... and gone. With the entire thread. LoL
"Sorry. :(

[Just happened over on /r/leagueoflegends](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/7dlcis/vizicsacsi_hylissang_very_unlikely_to_join_optic/dpyl6hz/) where some weird American hate Subreddit decided to brigade.

Suddenly the narrative on the post (and hundreds of downvotes) flip to some weird sort of DAE America sucks shit."
"So, for more clarification, it's specifically following a link and commenting/upvoting in a linked thread from one subreddit to another, which a lot of people did.

You'll notice the /r/btc comments were removed if you look at it with ceddit.

One thread also ended with /u/frogolocalypse telling me that the 50% of the world that exists on $3.50 a day or less would have to be subsidised to open payment channels.
Do you disagree with the deleted thread? Poor people DO need Bitcoin more than the rich. 
Autocorrect refuses to accept that Bitcoin exists.
I agree
One of the original developers.
Agreed, and although it has no advantage over consumer banks for everyday transactions, it does have a place as a private means of transactions. But I just see bitcoin as being held as a completely speculative asset for many people, not even as a currency for transactions, and not even derived from anything. Far too risky for me but it's ROI has been insane that's for sure.
"Fiat shill, must be baghodling waiting for the next USD ""spike"""
agreed
Nothing stays good forever, that's for sure
They follow their techniques to the letter
"The argument that currencies MUST be stable is pretty falacious, every single country in the world has some sort of inflation due to the absurd laws of banking, some have moderate inflation, some have incredibly stupid high inflation, and people just change prices accordingly. Venezuela is an example, where the minimum wage was 40.000Bs in january and right now its 400.000Bs (which is less money than the 40k were in january lol), is this good? obviously not, but im just pointing out that people learn to deal with unstable inflationary currencies, dealing with an unstable DEFLATIONARY one is easier. 

But also, as time goes on Bitcoin gets less volatile, yeah people freak out when it hits 7k then drops to 4.5k then goes up to 7.5k buts thats pretty ""stable"" compared to the old days when it would go from 8$ to 30$ then go as low as 3$.  And as time goes on it will get less volatile, but still deflationary, at around 5-10% deflation per year it would be pretty ideal as a currency. 

The whole ""Store of value"" is pretty ridiculous, gold is a store of value but gold is pretty, and is also useful for several stuff, making jewellery, scientific studies of electromagnetism, building high quality audio cables, building high quality movable parts inside things like clocks etc, etc. Bitcoin is only pretty for us geeks who see the beauty in the genius of how it works, but if you cant use it to pay for stuff, its useless, its not a store of value because you cant do shit with it, its a ponzi."
The point is, it's the policy of toxic leadership, and Nazis just happen to be a good example of toxic leadership.
True.
"> No-one suspected him until he began trying to convince them

some actually did. and if it came from them then it could have been more believable. so if he didn't want it to be believable he could have made this public claim to appear as a liar instead."
"Look into the timeline and what he actually posted. It is clear what happened:

Craig made a deal to take on the moniker. He admits that Satoshi was a team of people, but ""mainly him"". Craig comes out and media shitstorm ensues. Gavin says CSW proved it in a private settings. Blockstream gets the Australian Tax Office to go after Craig. Craig sees full weight of what it means to publicly be Satoshi and decides he can't handle it. Craig apologizes to Gavin. Gavin still stands by that CSW is Satoshi.

It's very clear why Craig doesn't want to cryptographically prove it in public. I wouldn't either."
It’s actually super obvious he isn’t SN. All you have to do is read Satoshi’s original posts and then read CSW’s tweets. They are completely different on every way except for the fact they both use English words. CSW is not Satoshi. The fact that he claimed to be Satoshi at one point is what should make people think. 
So what did you say? Must've been a big thing if it got deleted.
"So where should we send our tax returns to prove whether we “need” the network or not?

Bitcoin is not an app, it is a platform upon which apps are developed. 

If you want cheap payments there are a ton of altcoins that have little volume and are identical to BCH in their utility (if not better)

BTC is the only Bitcoin"
If you are talking about Craigh Wright, then he is a conman, and never was a developer in the first place. I'm not saying that this particular quote is wrong. But don't give this man a legacy he does not deserve. 
So your best example of people dealing with an unstable currency is Venezuela which is undergoing mass printing of money and has daily rioting due to political instability. Try again. If it every gets to that stage maybe, i dont think it will be anytime soon.
[deleted]
the entire town did not convert, certain shops accepted it as payment. most of those shops directly converted the bitcoins to flat currency immediately avoiding any issues with change in value. until you can have an economy running solely on bitcoin this will never happen. a business doesnt want to wake up and see 20% of their cash vanish overnight.
Explain deeper, be specific.
"How exactly do you figure? Explain. 

IF I ""put a bunch of money into bitcoin"" like 5 billion .... then i have a bunch

Don't matter"
"It's just not how bitcoin works .

This is how bit coin works 

It's a digital object.  You can have one. You keep them in a digital wallet.

The network is very good at verifying who is holding the objects. 

Other people elsewhere unrelated honestly, can ""mine"" more of the objects. Bitcoins. 

That's it. 

That's the whole ""it""

WTF is there to ""control"" exactly? 

Maybe they mean banks are controlling everything AROUND bitcoin, like the legality, the acceptability in the market, public interest, and investment in the sector.

Stay woke!
Genuine question, where do you see bitcoin going?
Craig is not Satoshi. People quoting him like he was Satoshi. Pillocks
"Okay :’)

Bitcoin is great.
Bitcoin as a payment system for the general audience is shit."
Absolutely correct. He also fought communism tooth and nail.

well thats the point, with increased Bitcoin adoption worldwide, we can have a Bitcoin <-> Bitcoin ecosystem, without the need to exchange for fiat!

"And who is warning you constantly not to use a smartphone wallet?

I remember several years back there was a company looking to roll out Bitcoin over SMS services to serve exactly those people using $10 feature phones."
And in that case what they wanted was to promote healthy family values, stop the spread of degenerate sexualized media, get their people back to work, get their economy back on track and out from under a massive and unfair debt load imposed by international bankers, stop the spread of communism, and stop a small clique of people from controlling and nearly monopolizing important sectors of the economy.  
Lol. Thanks for the effort. I couldn't bring myself to do it. 
That's bullshit, back in 2015 [an entire town](https://news.bitcoin.com/discussion-arnhem-bitcoinstad/) converted to Bitcoin. A deflationary currency has an inherent appeal against inflationary one for acceptance, you just need to make it easy enough to use.
"Yes it can and it is. Look deeper...

It's comical really. Today I read posts that were highlighting the fact that fees are lower than the previous week (of course, it's Sunday, there are fewer transactions...). In the comments people were saying that it was because the spammer stopped clogging the network. LMFAO
"I have answers but i know already your loop or reasoning and we will debate for 3 hours and simply watching that video will adress that loop and save both time for us both.

Asians are more intelligent in average but they are more centered in the middle, not as many geniuses as the white race and they have lower testosterone which inhibits them for having eccentric geniuses. Asians are good optimizing already invented things but they are not as good inventing new unproven ideas, difference in race behaviour. More research are needed in this but since its taboo it will simply never happen, i hope you know race biology research was a real thing less than 50 years ago but was banned.

Having IQ tests and make people breed with a match is not feasible.. how is romantic feelings supposed to develop inside some lab?

I'm sure, he lost the plot but still want to have a say for bitcoin's future. Odd.
I know, he must have shared to much farty air with Lukejr. They both tell people not to use SWbitcoin more and more.

I own BCH and I still don't understand. Please explain? How does centralizing would fulfill Satoshi's vision and be against bankers? We would only create another bank.

Source?
Sweet sarcasm 
"> He has done his best to be one of the only people we can be pretty sure is not Satoshi...

That is the worst part. The fact that they will pretend it doesn't work so that they can force their own ideas which centralise the network while pretending they are saving it from decentralisation.
And that comment is...?
Stop using reason and logic here. 
">Specifically: *Forming or joining a group that votes together, either on a specific post, a user's posts, posts from a domain, etc.*

Did we form a group, or did we just always care about fees? I don't think of myself as an rbtc member, I'm a bitcoiner, and I've always upvoted things like this, whatever subreddit they're in. 

"
It also implies that they support Bitcoin not disrupting banking or the remittance market. Especially when the top voted comment by a Core Dev recommends people just use banks. There’s nothing else to say.
Weird that my comment is hours old, but you and silent Sam discovered it and commented simultaneously. Almost like it was coordinated?
>Bicton
Yeah it doesn’t take a whole lot of thought to tell what actually happens. 
Who said it? 
Severely. 
All you people who think bitcoin is a 'solution' to problems are delusional. Bitcoin will never get accepted as a form of currency and because of that it will never be usable in daily transactions. One reason is difficulty in daily use but that can be fixed through technical improvements. The bigger issue is the ridiculous volatility of the currency. A currency MUST be stable, which bitcoin is not. Bitcoin and all its clones are being held up by nothing but speculation. Nobody knows when or where it will hit its roof. All you investment 'experts' have had an easy time since its been mostly an uphill climb in price but that will end.
"lol wha?

It's a fact, if you understand the technical underpinnings of bitcoin, that banks are not ""in control of it""

It's a distributed network, it can't be controlled by anyone. "
yep. it's explained very well in [JFK to 911 Everything Is A Rich Man's Trick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1Qt6a-vaNM)
"Your arguments are not very strong.

The difficulty in daily use one you shoot down yourself.

As for the volatility...it's in its infancy. If the world adopted it it would be a hell of a lot more stable. And in time it will get more mature and more stable as more people invest in it and understand it. Right now we're in the manipulation early stages...and it's in a hostile environment where countries/governments/controlling banks etc all have a lot to lose if Bitcoin succeeds with regards to control over the people, industry etc. 

But that is not to suggest that should that battle sway into Bitcoins favour that we wouldn't see major stability in the market. As soon as funny money fiat collapses there won't be some giant bankers with printed money able to manipulate the system as easily as now.

A currency must transact. It doesn't have to be stable. Every currency eventually becomes unstable. Every currency has moments of instability. Geez, the Canadian dollar gained and lost like 33% of its value in a year multiple times. 

All currency is held up by nothing but speculation. Your currency itself does nothing. It's just a con. People have confidence that if they accept $5 for something they will be able to spend it somewhere else and get something with a similar value. The moment they lose that confidence you have runs on the bank, hyperinflation, depressions, you name it. Chaos. We've seen it happen many many many times in history.

The price will almost certainly crash. Some coins will certainly die out completely (go to $0).

But not for reasons that the technology or use as currency isn't functional. 

Mostly because it's under attack. So pick your side. Truth or deception.

Many people get rich on deception. Many people live better lives in truth though. "
"They also use the Big Lie technique a lot, like about Blockstream's ""purely coincidental"" profiting off how Bitcoin is suppressed and twisted. 

I don't see why pointing out that the Nazis did the same thing is supposed to be a low blow or some ""Godwin"" joke. I mean, if it were just ""these guys are mean and controlling and the Nazis were mean and controlling"" that would be silly, but if it's a technique the Nazis were especially known for it's fair game. If they don't want to be compared to Nazis and North Korea perhaps they should stop acting in a way that  evokes Nazi Germany and North Korea."
That's perfectly the best quote for any kind of censorship made by anyone.
The banks control the flow of information and Core/Blockstream.  It couldn't be more obvious.
It can be controlled quite well actually if you've got a lot of money in there. 
"It's controlled by two groups:

 * The miners
 * The people who run full nodes

Those groups both have control by selecting what software they run. This is democracy. They don't have *direct* power, they have the ability to delegate power. The people they delegate power to are dev teams. For BTC right now, there's only one of those."
"Uhhh do you not remember teh fork?

Exchanges came down and just gave the ticker away/

lol

What are you smoking? if the major players bow to core's wishes. They control the network "
I see where you’re coming from. The core developers are what have been taken over. These guys are being paid by bankers to cripple the bitcoin protocol by not raising the Block size above 1mb. This is why there has been a huge debate. Bitcoin can’t disrupt banking if it has high transaction fees.  
"It can be controlled by the majority, or am I
wrong?

Edit: I mean a colluding majority might break the system"
"You are wrong. And I do understand the technical underpinnings of Bitcoin.

I think you are failing to understand the social and political takeover that has occurred.

""free choice"" is  not free choice if you do not know your options. And censorship dictates what options you see."
Please list all the websites & social discussion areas that you believe are being controlled by theymos right now. Let's see if your list is complete.
Blockhead
I'm a bot so clearly cannot respond, however were I not a bot and a free thinking human I might say that bitcoin was never meant for the rich, bitcoin came about during the '07-'08 financial crisis where the rich got richer and the poor got poorer. Satoshi created a digital peer to peer Cash to cut out banks and stop the fuckery the get away with and this mainly benefits the poor by having a deflationary currency that costs pennies to send in the case of BCH, BTC is lost to the banks now. 
No, it hasn't. The people exerting control over Bitcoin development and large media outlets are attempting to change it's purpose. But the original goal remains unchanged.
"We don't want to know that Blockstream is owned and run by central bankers who have vowed to destroy bitcoin.  Core are considered ""useful idiots"" and every little idiosyncrasy is applauded until the costs of transfers will climb and climb and choke the coin at its core."
I know 99% of the people who will hate me for saying that and calling me dumb, stupid etc have literally done ZERO research themselves except what was forced down their throats in history class/tv.
And not a single one of those is an iPhone. We need the Android version of Bitcoin, not the Apple version.
A smart phone can't magically convert btc into the local currency. 
yeah and we are warned constantly to not use smart phone wallets. Besides the people who don't have bank accounts are not the people using smart phones, they are truly poor, use a $10 feature phone .
Like most people on every bitcoin sub
I mean, to be fair there definitely were similar incidents recently, where people commenting pro r/Bitcoin things were getting an instant 250 downvotes, and pro r/btc things were getting an instant 250 upvotes. It could've been done by someone from r/Bitcoin to discredit r/btc, but either way, the attacks are real, so he isn't being paranoid.
So what are you? Roger Ver boy and fake Satoshi boy? These 2 are the biggest knobs in the crypto space

All leaders on all sides in all countries all throughout history understood that fear can be used to motivate people to do what you want. Pointing out that this common strand of thought was shared by the nazi's is moot.
I get where you're coming from but the Nazis were responsible for the death of >50m people. And everyone knows about their horrific crimes. Blockstream maybe a pack of assholes and liars but they certainly don't play in the same league with the Nazis.

"They didn’t brainwash anyone. That’s just propaganda. 

The Germans knew what the Jews were doing. They saw it every day in their daily lives. They have been expelled from hundreds of countries throughout history for the same reasons. 

It’s people today who have been brainwashed to think that Jews can do nothing wrong, and never have. All you have to do to realize this is BS is to as one question:  why would anyone go to such trouble over Jews for no reason at all?  

Yep. There were actually reasons. "
"When measuring from an indivudual to an individual the correletion is there but not very much, it's better to take an IQ test. But when the brain size differce between races (now we talking millions, billions) there are a much stronger correlection between brainsize and intelligence which both the IQ tests proves and the kinds of societies they produce. Now take into account the lower IQ with higher testosterone and you get a different behaviour pattern, one that might not be good for building and maintaining western-like socieities... actually low intelligence and high testosterone is more likely to produce crime and violence which is exactly what all statstics point to. And no it's not because of ""racism"" of police and judges, the same statistics are there in black nations too... its a WORLD WIDE PHENOMENOM.

Now i know everyone will think this is about white supremacy but if i say ASIANS has the largest brains and score the highest in IQ test im sure no one objects right? So don't let emotions stand away of facts.

"Does that really make him a conman though? Isn't everyone a conman if all it takes is telling a lie to be one?

I'd say he lying. Not that he was conning anyone."
More or less. The theory behind proof of work is that to perform a 51% attack is deincetivized because an attacker must expend a significant amount of resources to attempt. So much so, that it makes more sense for the attacker to become a normal participant as they will have a high rate of coin generation. Also, in the process of attempting a 51% attack users can see the hashrate change and react accordingly.
"until they realize it doesn't impact bitcoin going mainstream at all.

"One of the worst thing you can say when having an online discussion is ""you have a lot to learn about this or that"" this is an exchange of ideas and you have remotely no idea of what I know or do not know, so my advice is to stop that behavior in order to keep the discussion healthy.

Now obviously deflation isn't always better, in the context where liquidity is required there's no better option than to inflate the currency but the average Joe pays the cost. For the avg person deflation is almost always a better scenario.

And also with the current state of bitcoin I doubt it'll ever be good for payments, but BCH might, and if not, some other crypto will, it is the future of payments."
"Oh yeah you're right, so it's actually possible in theory if there are entities with a lot of computing power.

"""Lightning Networks"""
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpfvhiqFw7A&t=6m45s

If the lightning network ends up being a hub network, then who else would run the central hubs?  Billy who lives in his mom's basement?  No, a financial institution.  Probably starting with something like coinbase until big banks play catch-up.    

But who knows, maybe it will be a massive mesh network with no fees.  Doubt it though.    

But maybe I'm missing something.  How would this not happen?

Edit: I think this guy in the comments of that video expresses my concerns with this fairly well    
""The big issue here is that the common hubs that the system will naturally gravitate towards are big business and financial institutions. Supermarket chains, Petrol Stations, Utility companys and similar will all be the hubs with the most edges and as a result our payments will end up going through them, probably without us even realising it. This seems counter intuitive towards the whole blockchain/ Bitcoin ideal, which from the whitepaper itself is supposed to be a peer to peer system without financial institutions."""
I will deny that because it's not true, man you trolls are low quality. What's wrong? You cannot refute my original point about the poor and the rich so make up an argument?
IQ test results reflects the different brainsize averages in races.

Oh got it thanks
"I think Gavin was duped by a conman. I also think the last he said on the matter was that he might have been bamboozled, so the correct tense would be “so you think Gavin *was* lying”.

The signature proof that Craig offered to the media outlets was matched to an early transaction hash. He made a “verification script” that would take any random input, ignore it, and output a signature hash linked to an early block. It was enough to pass cursory inspection but wouldn’t hold up to any real scrutiny. Probably very similar to what he did with Gavin and why it was necessary to fly him halfway round the world and give him nothing to take away for closer inspection."
"I’ll take that to mean you don’t have an answer, and you’ve decided to hide behind unsubstantiated claims in YouTube videos.

Here’s a hint, for future reference. Just because someone else is saying the claim, doesn’t mean it’s a source. If the person who you link to doesn’t provide evidence, it’s no different than you just saying it."
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1mgrTGeDPM&t=2563s

That will answer most of your questions."
"So you’re saying white people should go ahead and bow out, so that the superior Asian race can have free reign? Have you had any children?

Also, why is it relevant if intelligence is attractive? If that were true, humans would get more intelligent over time, even if interbreeding were rampant, so why are you concerned about it?

I also don’t see how it’s not feasible to use IQ tests. Most people have to take them at some point, and they aren’t exactly expensive. If we’re talking about the future of human kind, why not drop the cash?

And finally, white people have not made “more or less everything”. That is simply not accurate in any way. And even if they had, that would disprove your entire theory. Your theory would predict that Asians would have produced more than anyone."
"First of all i already stated Asians have the highest intelligence and brainsize to those who would accuse me of this being ""white power"".

Secondly you say why aren't white people super smart? Well white people have created more or less everything so far. I would say white people are indeed the pioneers of the human race.

To the argument why not just test mates for highest IQ and disregard race: This seems like the most efficient way to do it but its not really realistically feasable and i think just breeding with your own race is good enough to preserve our genetics nature has so far given us. Also we all are sexually attracted to intelligent people, no women or man will find stupid people attractive for their stupidity... no being intelligent is an attractive attribute so with no effort by ourselves we want the most intelligent mate we can find.

Im not saying intelligence is all we are attracted too, looks and social status all play a role. But things like humor, respect among peergroups, being successful are all signs of intelligence.

"
Who is running into anyone's arms? Doesn't matter what CW did in the past. It doesn't make what he said wrong. You can try to invalidate what he said, but I don't run into the arms of the Core devs.
"Right, but the same is true for white people. That doesn’t change my point. If all you knew about a person is their IQ, you would have a very hard time figuring out their race, and vice versa.

Also, you and I (two white people) have very different brain size, IQ, skin tone, bone density, muscle mass, testosterone, hair color, eye color, etc. Every human (except for identical twins) is genetically and environmentally different from every other human. That doesn’t imply one “race” is better than another.

I’m glad you brought up dogs, because they are such a good counter to race based eugenics.

Dog breads were artificially selected for by humans. People wanted dogs that looked or acted a certain way, so they bread the dogs that exhibited the characteristics they were looking for.

Now let’s compare that to race based eugenics. You claim to want the human race to become more intelligent. If this were truly your goal, we know exactly how to go about achieving that. Test everyone for intelligence, and breed those with the highest IQ. Instead, you are suggesting that we test for skin color, and breed the whitest people.

Think about that for a second. Surely you must acknowledge that there are in fact stupid white people. And you’ve already acknowledged that black people can be intelligent as well. If you’re breeding for intelligence, why are you going about in such as slow way?

White people have mostly in-group bred for thousands of years. Sure, there’s been some genetic drift into Europe from Africa and Asia, but clearly that wasn’t substantial, or else white people would already be a lost cause. After all, you seem quite convinced that any substantial interracial breeding would taint the white race passed redemption, right?

So, if white people haven’t bred too much with other races, why aren’t we super smart already? We’ve essentially had a whites only eugenics policy for millennia, yet none of the great leaps that you promise us have yet to come.

Why is that? Humans have used similar techniques to radically change dogs within a single human life time. Why won’t it work on us, and if it hasn’t yet, what is going to suddenly change that?"
Bitch, please. I call both out on the regular. I'm not going to shun one group of hucksters only to run to the arms of a conman. If I must choose between either I choose neither. Quit being a fucking stooge.

[Ask me in six months; I don't trust my own judgement right now after all the drama.](https://mobile.twitter.com/gavinandresen/status/728316830683639808)

Six months later he published this [blog post](http://gavinandresen.ninja/either-or-ignore): 

>Now that six months have gone past, I’m being asked if I still think Craig Wright was Satoshi.

> I think there are two possibilities.

> Either he was Satoshi, but really wants the world to think he isn’t, so he created an impossible-to-untangle web of truths, half-truths and lies. And ruined his reputation in the process.

> If he was Satoshi, we should respect his wish to remain anonymous, and ignore him.

> The other possibility is he is a master scammer/fraudster who managed to trick some pretty smart people over a period of several years.

> In which case everybody except the victims of his fraud and law enforcement working on behalf of those victims should ignore him.

> So, either he was or he wasn’t. In either case, we should ignore him. I regret ever getting involved in the “who was Satoshi” game, and am going to spend my time on more fun and productive pursuits.

Unless there is something more recent on the matter, I don’t think that qualifies as Gavin still believing Craig is Satoshi. I also think his advice to ignore Craig is very good, lots of people on this sub could benefit from that advice."

"lol? I will assume you just misunderstood what I said.

What I said was that no fiat currency is really stable, they're always getting inflated, some more than others, the ones that get less inflated are the most useful ones, but they're still not stable.

Bitcoin gets less volatile over time and the idea is that it would eventually get to the point where it has a DEFLATIONARY rate similar in magnitude to the INFLATIONARY rate of current fiat currencies.

And in the mean time the people who are using it right now have an easier time dealing with its high volatility going up, compared to the people dealing with high volatility going down on their fiat currencies."

But then that would also destroy fiat. So...

It works fine. And it won't be adopted any time soon so it will work even better in the future when we have even more technical acumen. 

In other words, as time goes on cryptocurrencies become MORE realistic. Not less. "

You should read more first-hand accounts of what it was actually like for German citizens to live under Nazi rule. They were the ones who were supposed to benefit from all these wonderful policies and their lives were still largely miserable.

But even if everything you said were true, it still wouldn't be worth the price of marching through occupied lands, stealing food, burning homes, killing families.

You want a dose of reality? Try reading SS officer August Hafner's first-hand account of the murder of nearly 100 children - most younger than 6 - in Byelaya Tserkow. You can also read Helmuth Groscurth's official report, in which he complains that the orphans should have been killed the instant that their parents were shot by the SS. Instead they were left unsupervised in a locked building on the outskirts of town without food or water. The plan was to starve them but the wailing was keeping the troops awake.

This was not an isolated incident. Nor was it considered out of line with National Socialist ideology. You can read hundreds of similar reports.

But please, link me to some shallow YouTube videos showering the Nazis with praise and claiming they were misunderstood. I'm sure they're very entertaining. "

He deserves far more respect than Core devs. He may have tried to falsely claim to be Satoshi, but he represents Satoshi's vision far better than those who abuse Bitcoin.
Hear, hear. CW is **Fake**Satoshi
See now that's a fair argument. What you're saying is that poor people should transact with a cheaper crypto. I can see the sense in that. 
Sometimes CSW doesn't even use words, some sort of similar gibberish.
He is still understands Bitcoin better than the corrupt Core devs.

">If full nodes won't relay your transactions, you can't make any.
>
>If full nodes won't relay your blocks, you can't mine any.

You forget that miners are also full nodes and the largest miners participate in a global ultrafast relay network.

If one miner mines a block, all miners get it, whether or not a bunch of UASF full nodes agree. 

If one miner receives a transaction, all miners receive that transaction, whether or not a bunch of UASF full nodes agree.

UASF nodes do have the ability to get in the way of users by launching Sybil attacks against the network; pretending to be an impartial relay, but in reality engaging in censorship of transactions and blocks produced by real users and real miners. If enough of these cheap UASF ""full"" nodes clog up the network, it can be harder for real users to find real mining nodes who can validate their tx and get it into a block. "
Miners are full nodes and will be more than happy to relay them.
""" the potential damage one could cause is small – though enough that it cause a panic that would seriously threaten bitcoin’s use as a currency. At current network mining difficulty levels, not even large-scale governments could easily mount a 51% attack.""

So... small damage and not even a large government could pull it off. 

And isn't the mining hash difficultly getting harder all the time ? so the possibility of this is declining over time right? (though I guess global computational power is also rising over time so maybe it's a balance)"
I think you are talking about a 51% attack, and that can only happen with mining hash rate, not by holding 50% of all BTC. 50% of currency would be hella expensive and do nothing more than to increase demand trying to get to that point.

"> some actually did.

No, they didn’t. Jon Matonis claims that he met Craig at some conference and couldn’t shake the feeling that he’d just met Satoshi. But that was almost certainly the start of Craig’s con. That’s what con artists *do*. They lead people down a path, telling them what they want to hear, making them feel like they are in the driving seat. Jon Matonis got scammed. Gavin got scammed. Anyone in this community who still gives Craig the benefit of the doubt is likely to pay for that naivety at some point in the future."
"Where in that timeline does Craig go to major media outlets with fake cryptographic proof that he was Satoshi? Because note that after Gavin had relayed the story of the convoluted “proof” Craig offered him, most people with common sense already suspected Craig was a fraud. There was no rational reason for the theatrics he had insisted on.

So does it go like this:  

* Craig provided his weirdly convoluted proof to Gavin.  

* Then realised he didn’t want the attention.  

* *Then* provided fake proof to the media to cement his status as an obvious conman.  

* Then went quiet for a while before coming back with a PR company, army of sockpuppets, and frequent more subtle hints that he still want people to believe he is Satoshi.

Or some other equally nonsensical series of events?"

This.
What do you mean, Satoshi's vision? Nowhere in the whitepaper does it say anything about some kind of vision.
Satoshi has amassed quite a fortune in Bitcoin.  Estimates are that he has a million bitcoins.  He could single handedly destroy his creation by dumping all his Bitcoins.  If he really thinks that BCH fulfills his vision, he could sell all hit BTC for BCH and it would probably be game over for most cryptocurrencies.
Pretty sure if somehow he re appeared core would use all their tools to disprove it and say that he is a scammer or hacker who took control of his mail addresses / accounts / keys.
This is very true.  The market for safe, low-cost transfer services through banks has been established for two decades, if not longer.  And even if there weren't and this was still the 90's, crypto-currencies would be competing with [Hawaladars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawala) who are established and trusted by whole communities who send money through them.

We will continue this atrocity propaganda, we will increase it until nobody will accept one good word from the Germans anymore, until everything is destroyed which might have upheld them sympathies in other countries, and until they will be so confused that they don’t know what to do anymore. When this is reached, when they begin to pollute their own nest, and this not reluctantly but with hasty willingness to obey the winners, only then the victory is complete. It will never be definite.

I this it is would be removed regardless who said it it. It just inconvenient fact for their propaganda of bitcoin being only store of value. 
See my other post. There are much chaeper and instant ways to send money to this poor country. Their economy depends on it so they literally have 100's of options. This moron was using a international wire transfer, the worst way to send money to any one. They don't have bank accounts because they are too complicated to use and serve no purpose when you can pick up your remittance from anywhere in the country. They would never fucking jump through the hoops I have to jump through to use crypto.

It's a false premise there are cheap and fast ways to send money both from outside of the Philippines and inside the Philippines. Very cheap and a hell of a lot more convenient the BCH/BTC whatever and no where near 40% fees. Total nonsense. I live in the Philippines (from America). The BTC/PHP rate given by the exchanges are shit anyway, even without fees. And yes, using a foreign ATM card from Charles Schwab is one of the best ways. No ATM fees (they refund them) and the exact Visa exchange rate which is very close to the wholesale, it doesn't get any better than this. www.transferwise.com is also great. Stop using supposedly disenfranchised poor people to promote crypto, it's nonsense. The people who don't have accounts here do so not because they can't, they just don't know any better and have no use for it often. They need education more than crypto fucking currency. Rookies. The idiot in that screenshot is using a standard wire transfer that's about the worst way to send money to anyone in any country. In the Philippines there are 100's of options better than this. In fact I don't even believe that poster really send money to his mother that way, EVERYONE here knows better ways than a freaking wire-transfer. Remittance is a way of life.

"I'm having trouble finding a good way of sending money back home from overseas. Does anyone know a good alternative?

The only problem is I live in China"
Hitler would be proud of r/bitcoin
Unsub from that place...
"Bitcoin took off because it was a good store of value. It protected people against insane money printing by the central banks.

Not because I could spend it on bs consumer products that are over priced for what they are. 

I don’t need to trade my bitcoin for coffee. I can use the dollar for that.

If you can’t solve that problem, then you don’t deserve to exist.

If you want to help the poor, buy stellar."
yea the poor person has to wait for the mem pool to clear now.  In a few months it will be instant and near feeless making bitcoin cash only for the elite that need their coffee purchases settled on chain
It's like sum1 hasn't heard of Paypal friends and family...0%
Oh that’s why the comments were yellow! When did I get gilded?
"you can join my sub reddit,  theres no censorship

"""The rich do not need Bitcoin"" That shit sounds like a populist speech of party communist left and Latin American socialist"
Ditch Bitcoin for alts. Asic resistant coins are the future of crypto. 
TOP LEVEL TROLLING :D:D
Omisego (omg) will solve this problem once it rolls out.
"I wrote this article back in July https://keepingstock.net/why-ecuador-should-lift-cryptocurrency-ban-5ff240fcbd4c

Everything I said is mooted by the stupidly high fees :("
"If you don't understand the value proposition of the single most secure store of value ever, look at this survey of 1000 Americans: https://lendedu.com/blog/investing-in-bitcoin

Only 8% of survey responders bought Bitcoin to use for transactions. 92% plan to HODL it as a long term investment.

You tell me where the economic majority will go. The markets are clear, BTC is the winner."
The market has decided that they rather want bitcoin to be a store of value.. I don't like it,  but that's just what it is.. But it is totally unacceptable to censor this sort of thing. 
The emotional reactions in the crypto currency community are so telling of why the market is insanely volatile. Great reason to not invest, thanks for clarifying!
they are cunts
actually this post isnt true. the rich need bitcoin as well. for now, they are allowed to make transfers. this may stop one day.
Wow.. that post sounded like it supported the fact that you can send funds for < $20...  That's pretty crazy censorship.
The solution to the problem of remittances is block chain which doesn’t require bitcoin, it can be solved with any international currency.
This is a use case that Ripple is working to solve with their technology and XRP.  They are already quite far down the line in this.   More competition in the space good, but BCH has a lot of catch up not only in this area but in speed as well. 
"Actually though what bank are they using that charges those fees?

Even using money gram you have to send a few thousand dollars to get that big a fee, and a few thousand USD in the Philippines goes a long way."
"Some banks started closing accounts of people withdrawing money from crypto-currency. They will not just do business with us. It's not just a rumor, they really do it and one of the banks is a big name: ING Bank.
Bankers are really pissed off."
I can't agree with this more. The crypto space is rife with unacknowledged privilege and it's depressing. Discussions of class and access have been silenced by many. That's why I applaud what maiden.global is doing

how is r/bitcoin still not removed by reddit admins?!
i just sent a 10 sat/b transaction though
Replying a mere 8 words in this thread got me banned.  They are getting more and more thin skinned.  There are a lot of people there who think things are seriously wrong and are doubting and they are getting more and more desperate.  The more BCH continues to flourish the more pressure builds on them.  I can't see how they can contain this much longer.
A few days ago many reddit accounts were hacked and used to mass downvote posts in r/bitcoin and upvote posts here. I would say the admins' attention is now more here than there.
Well, what we call censorship is perfectly fine by reddit rules, it is really not fine when it comes to an open source community, and that's why r/btc exists.
"Humans have been mostly breeding with their own race for generations and the results are nonexistent.

You’re just spouting bullshit at this point. Your theory is self contradictory, and you’re just hand waving that away, so you don’t have to consider the inconsistencies.

You make claims, and don’t even attempt to back them up, but in your mind this is tantamount to proof. You’ve constructed your entire belief system around confirmation bias and pseudoscience. You say things like “this has never been disproven”, but when the proof against the claim is presented, you just ignore it and go on claiming it’s never been disproven.

I don’t know if you do these things intentionally, but if you are at all interested in actually figuring out what’s true, you have to be willing to look for evidence, beyond the evidence that agrees with you. Don’t assume things that agree with you are true, and don’t assume things that disagree with you are false. If you can’t do that, you will never be right about anything. You’ll just go on believing whatever random bullshit you learned as a child."
the mods yes, the readers - misled brothers who we can only hope to share the light with
Is he a crypto supporter? I'm not subscribed and I saw the previous thread from r/all. In fact, I'm here from r/all this time too. 
"> Yep, how shitty for crypto supporter, err. And he got plenty upvotes.

It is complete insanity, i can't describe in any other way. He is a Core developer."
Because by and large the support base of bch are proceeding with bch as a seamless continuation of btc, from the point of the fork. Think Black Sabbath vs Heaven and Hell, a continuation of the familiar with a minor but contentious change. Going forward if the BCH guys were right and BTC goes the way of the dodo, they can simply retake the Bitcoin name.
Bitcoin cash arguably posses better technology than bitcoin (faster and cheaper), but still inferior capabilities to many other cryptocurrencies, thats true. But, technology is only one part of the value of a currency. Network size and potential may be even more important, and in that area Bitcoin cash does better than many others.
"> Let’s just say that you are correct. Of all the alt currencies out there, why Bitcoin Cash? There seems to be so many better alts to shill. I still do not understand the appeal of this one.

You would understand if you owned Bitcoin before August 1.  You would have BCH and realize it was just a continuation of your original investment in Bitcoin.

"
">  He could single handedly destroy his creation

The nice thing: No. Just postpone the development once again. **Bitcoin can't die**"
"No. They would make sure he outlived his purpose and had a great idea that just didn't work in practice.

Sounds more plausible.

But I am on their side on CSW. He has done his best to be one of the only people we can be pretty sure is not Satoshi... "
I dropped a comment...
"Actually, it's because it's Vote Manipulation.

Ironically, it's because [the thread was linked here](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7dzim0/craig_wright_quote_arguing_against_using_btc_in/) and was heavily manipulated with /r/BTC posters posting there.

As you see, they've flagged the post for Vote Manipulation.

You cannot directly link threads on one subreddit to another subreddit.

To further elaborate, [here's the reddit rules](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/what-constitutes-vote).

Specifically: *Forming or joining a group that votes together, either on a specific post, a user's posts, posts from a domain, etc.*

You can get suspended for doing this."
It's a CSW quote and it makes high fees look bad, both things r/Bitcoin want to control the narrative on. 
Wow.  You guys really are sick.  
"Quoting Bitcoin developers is now a ""social attack"" to the new thought police at r/Bitcoin."
Social attack? Against who? You must be new to Bitcoin if you disagree.
"It's a fucking vague opinion on who has more need for a thing, how can it be ""not true""?"
You probably take things for face value without contributing much thought.
Well it was true until Core became the central authority and decided to change Bitcoin onto something else.
It got removed because they figured out who said it. 
I've noticed this too since the days of IRC.
"He's not saying ""use banks instead"", he's saying that's using banks is a possibility. He's not favouring one option over the other, just explaining possibilities."
"> Because he's a voice of reason. Bitcoin isn't a religion but you guys sure treat it like one. People know the banking system, if I told my mom we're going to try this Bitcoin thing she wouldn't even want to hear it.

Bitcoin was created to bypass government's financial system, financial institutions and any other third part and so having full control and freedom over your money with the plus of cheap, fast and non reversible transactions. Sure if nothing of this is of your interest you should be using something else like a bank, not Bitcoin. His comment is weird, insane. He admitted Bitcoin was killed.  "
I guess I'm wondering what the suspicions of the mods at /r/bitcoin is. What agenda are they promoting? What agenda are they preventing?
We are all or at least try to be..
Yup, I don't even get it, it's not like these poor countries are magically gonna sprout up a bunch of affordable and easy to exchanges. I mean fuck, it's hard enough to even buy crypto in certain states in the USA. 
The goal/purpose of bitcoin has changed over time
Bitcoin Cash will make its own friends
"We're here to tell you about our lord and saviour Roger Ver and his massive mining pools that utilize asicboost to maximize and centralize our profitability.  Would you like to know more?

When you call someone a moron because they don't have the same knowledge as you do, it makes you look unkind and uncouth.  
"Go to liveleaks, type in ""man hit by car,"" or ""woman crashes moped"" with ANY 3rd world country and you'll see 25 people standing around with their smart phones filming away.

Look at smart phone active use in the world.  It's in the many billions
Oh, it was a planned attack of r/btc redditors on the r/Bitcoin? I think it's safe to say that you are paranoid and delusional.
i read ,not long ago, in there that bitcoin is not mean to use as currency
Don't project please Blockstream boy

No, Göring is one of the reference sources of nowaday propaganda tactics. This is (now) science, baby.
"**I concur**.


*They might share some similarities, but from time to time all of humanity does.*


We need to not blame **all of them**, for the acts of **but a mere few**; and we need to make **darned** sure that we do **not** follow in their footsteps.


u/tippr gild"
">**Göring:** Oh, that is all well and good, but, voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. **All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked** and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country.

http://www.snopes.com/quotes/goering.asp

The nazi make senses unfortunately, using « being under attack » to justify censorship."
It is Blockstream policy. And censorship is not the only Nazi card these people play, just one of many. The more I see what they do the more I think of that, it is like they read the manual
"> bitcoin being only store of value

That's kinda stupid. Isn't ""transferring money"" literally the same as ""storing money then withdrawing it somewhere else""?"
I'm not too familiar with Bitcoin, why is its use as poor-people currency such a negative thing to them? Isn't greater utility a positive?
I don't think he was playing the Nazi card, but rather referencing a famous propagandist whose name would be known by many.
And I'd say that's not even the best way to do it but still better than BTC.
"
Grow up and stop being a baby."

He lost his private keys...
This is pretty blatant evidence that banks are in control of Bitcoin right now.
"> Even the top upvoted comment is a Core Dev (maaku) suggesting people just use banks instead (?!)

I believe you misunderstood what he wrote. He isn't endorsing banks, just saying that even banks offer better prices."
Head on back to your censored echo chamber and post some memes. We’re trying to get stuff right over here. 
"Not sure why the downvote.

I would LOVE to see a pro-Blockstream, pro-Core, pro-big block, pro-""store of value"" sub without any censorship.

I think we should all welcome the idea."
Why do you approval of he removal?
"""Bitcoin - A Peer to Peer Electronic Cash""

Is cash only a store of value and not a payment method?..."
Name checks out. 
Exactly why is this a good job? 
Read the title of the white paper.
Because Bitcoin is a far more complex solution to the guy’s problem than just going to a different bank.
That isn't really the point. Are you missing that the beef is with /r/bitcoin censoring posts instead of just using reason against them.
"The problem with living in a bubble (r/bitcoin) is that you only hear self-accolading comments.  Pretty soon, you are oblivious to the outside world and you believe your own propaganda.

Sooner or later, there will be a flood of money out of BTC to cryptos that you can trade with and those guys are going to be genuinely surprised."
"re-read that comment to yourself a few times slowly and consider if that is something a decent human being would say no matter which side of the ""debate"" you are on."
