Can someone with a lot of twitter followers post this link to bring attention to this gigantic display of petty insecurity from the mods?

The Nazis were using these techniques long before they started WWII or the concentration camps. The price of freedom is vigilance.
I agree. Core look more like a bunch of Bolshevicks.  
It's the same state of consciousness. The intolerance of the free will of others the attempt to control it the appeal to authority the denial of the individual. If the social environment was different and allowed for physical control and they had power to excersice it they would indeed have no qualms about doing that.

Fair enough!
What? That's why the BCH users are using bch. There's no secret btc destruction plan in there, or a statement of who I think is right, just an answer to your question
"Core have spread missinformation around centralization. Trying to make people believe the word means something it doesnt.

https://diglife.com/content/images/2017/08/network_types_simplified.png

there you can see, from left to right, a centralized, a decentralized, and a distributed network.

Keeping block size small keeps the network more DISTRIBUTED, not decentralized. bigger blocks means less people can run full nodes making the network look more like the image in the center, a DECENTRALIZED NETWORK. Those who can run full nodes keep the network decentralized. It would only be centralized if suddendly all nodes were controlled by one party, which is absurd when you have people all around the world running full BCH nodes, its impossible for one party to own the majority of them.

"
Yeah, I wonder why someone would do that...
I hate this conspiracy theory post-hoc rationalisation crap. If Craig Wright wanted people to think he wasn’t Satoshi Nakamoto, the simplest thing he could have done was **not publicly claim to be Satoshi Nakamoto**. No-one suspected him until he began trying to convince them. The idea that he was throwing people off his trail - after yelling and shouting “hey, come over here to this trail” - is retarded.
... and gone. With the entire thread. LoL
"Sorry. :(

[Just happened over on /r/leagueoflegends](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/7dlcis/vizicsacsi_hylissang_very_unlikely_to_join_optic/dpyl6hz/) where some weird American hate Subreddit decided to brigade.

Suddenly the narrative on the post (and hundreds of downvotes) flip to some weird sort of DAE America sucks shit."
"So, for more clarification, it's specifically following a link and commenting/upvoting in a linked thread from one subreddit to another, which a lot of people did.

You'll notice the /r/btc comments were removed if you look at it with ceddit.

One thread also ended with /u/frogolocalypse telling me that the 50% of the world that exists on $3.50 a day or less would have to be subsidised to open payment channels.
Do you disagree with the deleted thread? Poor people DO need Bitcoin more than the rich. 
Autocorrect refuses to accept that Bitcoin exists.
I agree
One of the original developers.
Agreed, and although it has no advantage over consumer banks for everyday transactions, it does have a place as a private means of transactions. But I just see bitcoin as being held as a completely speculative asset for many people, not even as a currency for transactions, and not even derived from anything. Far too risky for me but it's ROI has been insane that's for sure.
"Fiat shill, must be baghodling waiting for the next USD ""spike"""
agreed
Nothing stays good forever, that's for sure
They follow their techniques to the letter
"The argument that currencies MUST be stable is pretty falacious, every single country in the world has some sort of inflation due to the absurd laws of banking, some have moderate inflation, some have incredibly stupid high inflation, and people just change prices accordingly. Venezuela is an example, where the minimum wage was 40.000Bs in january and right now its 400.000Bs (which is less money than the 40k were in january lol), is this good? obviously not, but im just pointing out that people learn to deal with unstable inflationary currencies, dealing with an unstable DEFLATIONARY one is easier. 

But also, as time goes on Bitcoin gets less volatile, yeah people freak out when it hits 7k then drops to 4.5k then goes up to 7.5k buts thats pretty ""stable"" compared to the old days when it would go from 8$ to 30$ then go as low as 3$.  And as time goes on it will get less volatile, but still deflationary, at around 5-10% deflation per year it would be pretty ideal as a currency. 

The whole ""Store of value"" is pretty ridiculous, gold is a store of value but gold is pretty, and is also useful for several stuff, making jewellery, scientific studies of electromagnetism, building high quality audio cables, building high quality movable parts inside things like clocks etc, etc. Bitcoin is only pretty for us geeks who see the beauty in the genius of how it works, but if you cant use it to pay for stuff, its useless, its not a store of value because you cant do shit with it, its a ponzi."
The point is, it's the policy of toxic leadership, and Nazis just happen to be a good example of toxic leadership.
True.
"> No-one suspected him until he began trying to convince them

some actually did. and if it came from them then it could have been more believable. so if he didn't want it to be believable he could have made this public claim to appear as a liar instead."
"Look into the timeline and what he actually posted. It is clear what happened:

Craig made a deal to take on the moniker. He admits that Satoshi was a team of people, but ""mainly him"". Craig comes out and media shitstorm ensues. Gavin says CSW proved it in a private settings. Blockstream gets the Australian Tax Office to go after Craig. Craig sees full weight of what it means to publicly be Satoshi and decides he can't handle it. Craig apologizes to Gavin. Gavin still stands by that CSW is Satoshi.

It's very clear why Craig doesn't want to cryptographically prove it in public. I wouldn't either."
It’s actually super obvious he isn’t SN. All you have to do is read Satoshi’s original posts and then read CSW’s tweets. They are completely different on every way except for the fact they both use English words. CSW is not Satoshi. The fact that he claimed to be Satoshi at one point is what should make people think. 
So what did you say? Must've been a big thing if it got deleted.
"So where should we send our tax returns to prove whether we “need” the network or not?

Bitcoin is not an app, it is a platform upon which apps are developed. 

If you want cheap payments there are a ton of altcoins that have little volume and are identical to BCH in their utility (if not better)

BTC is the only Bitcoin"
If you are talking about Craigh Wright, then he is a conman, and never was a developer in the first place. I'm not saying that this particular quote is wrong. But don't give this man a legacy he does not deserve. 
So your best example of people dealing with an unstable currency is Venezuela which is undergoing mass printing of money and has daily rioting due to political instability. Try again. If it every gets to that stage maybe, i dont think it will be anytime soon.
[deleted]
the entire town did not convert, certain shops accepted it as payment. most of those shops directly converted the bitcoins to flat currency immediately avoiding any issues with change in value. until you can have an economy running solely on bitcoin this will never happen. a business doesnt want to wake up and see 20% of their cash vanish overnight.
Explain deeper, be specific.
"How exactly do you figure? Explain. 

IF I ""put a bunch of money into bitcoin"" like 5 billion .... then i have a bunch

Don't matter"
"It's just not how bitcoin works .

This is how bit coin works 

It's a digital object.  You can have one. You keep them in a digital wallet.

The network is very good at verifying who is holding the objects. 

Other people elsewhere unrelated honestly, can ""mine"" more of the objects. Bitcoins. 

That's it. 

That's the whole ""it""

WTF is there to ""control"" exactly? 

Maybe they mean banks are controlling everything AROUND bitcoin, like the legality, the acceptability in the market, public interest, and investment in the sector.

Stay woke!
Genuine question, where do you see bitcoin going?
Craig is not Satoshi. People quoting him like he was Satoshi. Pillocks
"Okay :’)

Bitcoin is great.
Bitcoin as a payment system for the general audience is shit."
Absolutely correct. He also fought communism tooth and nail.

well thats the point, with increased Bitcoin adoption worldwide, we can have a Bitcoin <-> Bitcoin ecosystem, without the need to exchange for fiat!

"And who is warning you constantly not to use a smartphone wallet?

I remember several years back there was a company looking to roll out Bitcoin over SMS services to serve exactly those people using $10 feature phones."
And in that case what they wanted was to promote healthy family values, stop the spread of degenerate sexualized media, get their people back to work, get their economy back on track and out from under a massive and unfair debt load imposed by international bankers, stop the spread of communism, and stop a small clique of people from controlling and nearly monopolizing important sectors of the economy.  
Lol. Thanks for the effort. I couldn't bring myself to do it. 
That's bullshit, back in 2015 [an entire town](https://news.bitcoin.com/discussion-arnhem-bitcoinstad/) converted to Bitcoin. A deflationary currency has an inherent appeal against inflationary one for acceptance, you just need to make it easy enough to use.
"Yes it can and it is. Look deeper...

It's comical really. Today I read posts that were highlighting the fact that fees are lower than the previous week (of course, it's Sunday, there are fewer transactions...). In the comments people were saying that it was because the spammer stopped clogging the network. LMFAO
"I have answers but i know already your loop or reasoning and we will debate for 3 hours and simply watching that video will adress that loop and save both time for us both.

Asians are more intelligent in average but they are more centered in the middle, not as many geniuses as the white race and they have lower testosterone which inhibits them for having eccentric geniuses. Asians are good optimizing already invented things but they are not as good inventing new unproven ideas, difference in race behaviour. More research are needed in this but since its taboo it will simply never happen, i hope you know race biology research was a real thing less than 50 years ago but was banned.

Having IQ tests and make people breed with a match is not feasible.. how is romantic feelings supposed to develop inside some lab?

I'm sure, he lost the plot but still want to have a say for bitcoin's future. Odd.
I know, he must have shared to much farty air with Lukejr. They both tell people not to use SWbitcoin more and more.

I own BCH and I still don't understand. Please explain? How does centralizing would fulfill Satoshi's vision and be against bankers? We would only create another bank.

Source?
Sweet sarcasm 
"> He has done his best to be one of the only people we can be pretty sure is not Satoshi...

That is the worst part. The fact that they will pretend it doesn't work so that they can force their own ideas which centralise the network while pretending they are saving it from decentralisation.
And that comment is...?
Stop using reason and logic here. 
">Specifically: *Forming or joining a group that votes together, either on a specific post, a user's posts, posts from a domain, etc.*

Did we form a group, or did we just always care about fees? I don't think of myself as an rbtc member, I'm a bitcoiner, and I've always upvoted things like this, whatever subreddit they're in. 

"
It also implies that they support Bitcoin not disrupting banking or the remittance market. Especially when the top voted comment by a Core Dev recommends people just use banks. There’s nothing else to say.
Weird that my comment is hours old, but you and silent Sam discovered it and commented simultaneously. Almost like it was coordinated?
>Bicton
Yeah it doesn’t take a whole lot of thought to tell what actually happens. 
Who said it? 
Severely. 
All you people who think bitcoin is a 'solution' to problems are delusional. Bitcoin will never get accepted as a form of currency and because of that it will never be usable in daily transactions. One reason is difficulty in daily use but that can be fixed through technical improvements. The bigger issue is the ridiculous volatility of the currency. A currency MUST be stable, which bitcoin is not. Bitcoin and all its clones are being held up by nothing but speculation. Nobody knows when or where it will hit its roof. All you investment 'experts' have had an easy time since its been mostly an uphill climb in price but that will end.
"lol wha?

It's a fact, if you understand the technical underpinnings of bitcoin, that banks are not ""in control of it""

It's a distributed network, it can't be controlled by anyone. "
yep. it's explained very well in [JFK to 911 Everything Is A Rich Man's Trick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1Qt6a-vaNM)
"Your arguments are not very strong.

The difficulty in daily use one you shoot down yourself.

As for the volatility...it's in its infancy. If the world adopted it it would be a hell of a lot more stable. And in time it will get more mature and more stable as more people invest in it and understand it. Right now we're in the manipulation early stages...and it's in a hostile environment where countries/governments/controlling banks etc all have a lot to lose if Bitcoin succeeds with regards to control over the people, industry etc. 

But that is not to suggest that should that battle sway into Bitcoins favour that we wouldn't see major stability in the market. As soon as funny money fiat collapses there won't be some giant bankers with printed money able to manipulate the system as easily as now.

A currency must transact. It doesn't have to be stable. Every currency eventually becomes unstable. Every currency has moments of instability. Geez, the Canadian dollar gained and lost like 33% of its value in a year multiple times. 

All currency is held up by nothing but speculation. Your currency itself does nothing. It's just a con. People have confidence that if they accept $5 for something they will be able to spend it somewhere else and get something with a similar value. The moment they lose that confidence you have runs on the bank, hyperinflation, depressions, you name it. Chaos. We've seen it happen many many many times in history.

The price will almost certainly crash. Some coins will certainly die out completely (go to $0).

But not for reasons that the technology or use as currency isn't functional. 

Mostly because it's under attack. So pick your side. Truth or deception.

Many people get rich on deception. Many people live better lives in truth though. "
"They also use the Big Lie technique a lot, like about Blockstream's ""purely coincidental"" profiting off how Bitcoin is suppressed and twisted. 

I don't see why pointing out that the Nazis did the same thing is supposed to be a low blow or some ""Godwin"" joke. I mean, if it were just ""these guys are mean and controlling and the Nazis were mean and controlling"" that would be silly, but if it's a technique the Nazis were especially known for it's fair game. If they don't want to be compared to Nazis and North Korea perhaps they should stop acting in a way that  evokes Nazi Germany and North Korea."
That's perfectly the best quote for any kind of censorship made by anyone.
The banks control the flow of information and Core/Blockstream.  It couldn't be more obvious.
It can be controlled quite well actually if you've got a lot of money in there. 
"It's controlled by two groups:

 * The miners
 * The people who run full nodes

Those groups both have control by selecting what software they run. This is democracy. They don't have *direct* power, they have the ability to delegate power. The people they delegate power to are dev teams. For BTC right now, there's only one of those."
"Uhhh do you not remember teh fork?

Exchanges came down and just gave the ticker away/

lol

What are you smoking? if the major players bow to core's wishes. They control the network "
I see where you’re coming from. The core developers are what have been taken over. These guys are being paid by bankers to cripple the bitcoin protocol by not raising the Block size above 1mb. This is why there has been a huge debate. Bitcoin can’t disrupt banking if it has high transaction fees.  
"It can be controlled by the majority, or am I
wrong?

Edit: I mean a colluding majority might break the system"
"You are wrong. And I do understand the technical underpinnings of Bitcoin.

I think you are failing to understand the social and political takeover that has occurred.

""free choice"" is  not free choice if you do not know your options. And censorship dictates what options you see."
Please list all the websites & social discussion areas that you believe are being controlled by theymos right now. Let's see if your list is complete.
Blockhead
I'm a bot so clearly cannot respond, however were I not a bot and a free thinking human I might say that bitcoin was never meant for the rich, bitcoin came about during the '07-'08 financial crisis where the rich got richer and the poor got poorer. Satoshi created a digital peer to peer Cash to cut out banks and stop the fuckery the get away with and this mainly benefits the poor by having a deflationary currency that costs pennies to send in the case of BCH, BTC is lost to the banks now. 
No, it hasn't. The people exerting control over Bitcoin development and large media outlets are attempting to change it's purpose. But the original goal remains unchanged.
"We don't want to know that Blockstream is owned and run by central bankers who have vowed to destroy bitcoin.  Core are considered ""useful idiots"" and every little idiosyncrasy is applauded until the costs of transfers will climb and climb and choke the coin at its core."
I know 99% of the people who will hate me for saying that and calling me dumb, stupid etc have literally done ZERO research themselves except what was forced down their throats in history class/tv.
And not a single one of those is an iPhone. We need the Android version of Bitcoin, not the Apple version.
A smart phone can't magically convert btc into the local currency. 
yeah and we are warned constantly to not use smart phone wallets. Besides the people who don't have bank accounts are not the people using smart phones, they are truly poor, use a $10 feature phone .
Like most people on every bitcoin sub
I mean, to be fair there definitely were similar incidents recently, where people commenting pro r/Bitcoin things were getting an instant 250 downvotes, and pro r/btc things were getting an instant 250 upvotes. It could've been done by someone from r/Bitcoin to discredit r/btc, but either way, the attacks are real, so he isn't being paranoid.
So what are you? Roger Ver boy and fake Satoshi boy? These 2 are the biggest knobs in the crypto space

All leaders on all sides in all countries all throughout history understood that fear can be used to motivate people to do what you want. Pointing out that this common strand of thought was shared by the nazi's is moot.
I get where you're coming from but the Nazis were responsible for the death of >50m people. And everyone knows about their horrific crimes. Blockstream maybe a pack of assholes and liars but they certainly don't play in the same league with the Nazis.

"They didn’t brainwash anyone. That’s just propaganda. 

The Germans knew what the Jews were doing. They saw it every day in their daily lives. They have been expelled from hundreds of countries throughout history for the same reasons. 

It’s people today who have been brainwashed to think that Jews can do nothing wrong, and never have. All you have to do to realize this is BS is to as one question:  why would anyone go to such trouble over Jews for no reason at all?  

Yep. There were actually reasons. "
"When measuring from an indivudual to an individual the correletion is there but not very much, it's better to take an IQ test. But when the brain size differce between races (now we talking millions, billions) there are a much stronger correlection between brainsize and intelligence which both the IQ tests proves and the kinds of societies they produce. Now take into account the lower IQ with higher testosterone and you get a different behaviour pattern, one that might not be good for building and maintaining western-like socieities... actually low intelligence and high testosterone is more likely to produce crime and violence which is exactly what all statstics point to. And no it's not because of ""racism"" of police and judges, the same statistics are there in black nations too... its a WORLD WIDE PHENOMENOM.

Now i know everyone will think this is about white supremacy but if i say ASIANS has the largest brains and score the highest in IQ test im sure no one objects right? So don't let emotions stand away of facts.

"Does that really make him a conman though? Isn't everyone a conman if all it takes is telling a lie to be one?

I'd say he lying. Not that he was conning anyone."
More or less. The theory behind proof of work is that to perform a 51% attack is deincetivized because an attacker must expend a significant amount of resources to attempt. So much so, that it makes more sense for the attacker to become a normal participant as they will have a high rate of coin generation. Also, in the process of attempting a 51% attack users can see the hashrate change and react accordingly.
"until they realize it doesn't impact bitcoin going mainstream at all.

"One of the worst thing you can say when having an online discussion is ""you have a lot to learn about this or that"" this is an exchange of ideas and you have remotely no idea of what I know or do not know, so my advice is to stop that behavior in order to keep the discussion healthy.

Now obviously deflation isn't always better, in the context where liquidity is required there's no better option than to inflate the currency but the average Joe pays the cost. For the avg person deflation is almost always a better scenario.

And also with the current state of bitcoin I doubt it'll ever be good for payments, but BCH might, and if not, some other crypto will, it is the future of payments."
"Oh yeah you're right, so it's actually possible in theory if there are entities with a lot of computing power.

"""Lightning Networks"""
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpfvhiqFw7A&t=6m45s

If the lightning network ends up being a hub network, then who else would run the central hubs?  Billy who lives in his mom's basement?  No, a financial institution.  Probably starting with something like coinbase until big banks play catch-up.    

But who knows, maybe it will be a massive mesh network with no fees.  Doubt it though.    

But maybe I'm missing something.  How would this not happen?

Edit: I think this guy in the comments of that video expresses my concerns with this fairly well    
""The big issue here is that the common hubs that the system will naturally gravitate towards are big business and financial institutions. Supermarket chains, Petrol Stations, Utility companys and similar will all be the hubs with the most edges and as a result our payments will end up going through them, probably without us even realising it. This seems counter intuitive towards the whole blockchain/ Bitcoin ideal, which from the whitepaper itself is supposed to be a peer to peer system without financial institutions."""
I will deny that because it's not true, man you trolls are low quality. What's wrong? You cannot refute my original point about the poor and the rich so make up an argument?
IQ test results reflects the different brainsize averages in races.

Oh got it thanks
"I think Gavin was duped by a conman. I also think the last he said on the matter was that he might have been bamboozled, so the correct tense would be “so you think Gavin *was* lying”.

The signature proof that Craig offered to the media outlets was matched to an early transaction hash. He made a “verification script” that would take any random input, ignore it, and output a signature hash linked to an early block. It was enough to pass cursory inspection but wouldn’t hold up to any real scrutiny. Probably very similar to what he did with Gavin and why it was necessary to fly him halfway round the world and give him nothing to take away for closer inspection."
"I’ll take that to mean you don’t have an answer, and you’ve decided to hide behind unsubstantiated claims in YouTube videos.

Here’s a hint, for future reference. Just because someone else is saying the claim, doesn’t mean it’s a source. If the person who you link to doesn’t provide evidence, it’s no different than you just saying it."
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1mgrTGeDPM&t=2563s

That will answer most of your questions."
"So you’re saying white people should go ahead and bow out, so that the superior Asian race can have free reign? Have you had any children?

Also, why is it relevant if intelligence is attractive? If that were true, humans would get more intelligent over time, even if interbreeding were rampant, so why are you concerned about it?

I also don’t see how it’s not feasible to use IQ tests. Most people have to take them at some point, and they aren’t exactly expensive. If we’re talking about the future of human kind, why not drop the cash?

And finally, white people have not made “more or less everything”. That is simply not accurate in any way. And even if they had, that would disprove your entire theory. Your theory would predict that Asians would have produced more than anyone."
"First of all i already stated Asians have the highest intelligence and brainsize to those who would accuse me of this being ""white power"".

Secondly you say why aren't white people super smart? Well white people have created more or less everything so far. I would say white people are indeed the pioneers of the human race.

To the argument why not just test mates for highest IQ and disregard race: This seems like the most efficient way to do it but its not really realistically feasable and i think just breeding with your own race is good enough to preserve our genetics nature has so far given us. Also we all are sexually attracted to intelligent people, no women or man will find stupid people attractive for their stupidity... no being intelligent is an attractive attribute so with no effort by ourselves we want the most intelligent mate we can find.

Im not saying intelligence is all we are attracted too, looks and social status all play a role. But things like humor, respect among peergroups, being successful are all signs of intelligence.

"
Who is running into anyone's arms? Doesn't matter what CW did in the past. It doesn't make what he said wrong. You can try to invalidate what he said, but I don't run into the arms of the Core devs.
"Right, but the same is true for white people. That doesn’t change my point. If all you knew about a person is their IQ, you would have a very hard time figuring out their race, and vice versa.

Also, you and I (two white people) have very different brain size, IQ, skin tone, bone density, muscle mass, testosterone, hair color, eye color, etc. Every human (except for identical twins) is genetically and environmentally different from every other human. That doesn’t imply one “race” is better than another.

I’m glad you brought up dogs, because they are such a good counter to race based eugenics.

Dog breads were artificially selected for by humans. People wanted dogs that looked or acted a certain way, so they bread the dogs that exhibited the characteristics they were looking for.

Now let’s compare that to race based eugenics. You claim to want the human race to become more intelligent. If this were truly your goal, we know exactly how to go about achieving that. Test everyone for intelligence, and breed those with the highest IQ. Instead, you are suggesting that we test for skin color, and breed the whitest people.

Think about that for a second. Surely you must acknowledge that there are in fact stupid white people. And you’ve already acknowledged that black people can be intelligent as well. If you’re breeding for intelligence, why are you going about in such as slow way?

White people have mostly in-group bred for thousands of years. Sure, there’s been some genetic drift into Europe from Africa and Asia, but clearly that wasn’t substantial, or else white people would already be a lost cause. After all, you seem quite convinced that any substantial interracial breeding would taint the white race passed redemption, right?

So, if white people haven’t bred too much with other races, why aren’t we super smart already? We’ve essentially had a whites only eugenics policy for millennia, yet none of the great leaps that you promise us have yet to come.

Why is that? Humans have used similar techniques to radically change dogs within a single human life time. Why won’t it work on us, and if it hasn’t yet, what is going to suddenly change that?"
Bitch, please. I call both out on the regular. I'm not going to shun one group of hucksters only to run to the arms of a conman. If I must choose between either I choose neither. Quit being a fucking stooge.

[Ask me in six months; I don't trust my own judgement right now after all the drama.](https://mobile.twitter.com/gavinandresen/status/728316830683639808)

Six months later he published this [blog post](http://gavinandresen.ninja/either-or-ignore): 

>Now that six months have gone past, I’m being asked if I still think Craig Wright was Satoshi.

> I think there are two possibilities.

> Either he was Satoshi, but really wants the world to think he isn’t, so he created an impossible-to-untangle web of truths, half-truths and lies. And ruined his reputation in the process.

> If he was Satoshi, we should respect his wish to remain anonymous, and ignore him.

> The other possibility is he is a master scammer/fraudster who managed to trick some pretty smart people over a period of several years.

> In which case everybody except the victims of his fraud and law enforcement working on behalf of those victims should ignore him.

> So, either he was or he wasn’t. In either case, we should ignore him. I regret ever getting involved in the “who was Satoshi” game, and am going to spend my time on more fun and productive pursuits.

Unless there is something more recent on the matter, I don’t think that qualifies as Gavin still believing Craig is Satoshi. I also think his advice to ignore Craig is very good, lots of people on this sub could benefit from that advice."

"lol? I will assume you just misunderstood what I said.

What I said was that no fiat currency is really stable, they're always getting inflated, some more than others, the ones that get less inflated are the most useful ones, but they're still not stable.

Bitcoin gets less volatile over time and the idea is that it would eventually get to the point where it has a DEFLATIONARY rate similar in magnitude to the INFLATIONARY rate of current fiat currencies.

And in the mean time the people who are using it right now have an easier time dealing with its high volatility going up, compared to the people dealing with high volatility going down on their fiat currencies."

But then that would also destroy fiat. So...

It works fine. And it won't be adopted any time soon so it will work even better in the future when we have even more technical acumen. 

In other words, as time goes on cryptocurrencies become MORE realistic. Not less. "

You should read more first-hand accounts of what it was actually like for German citizens to live under Nazi rule. They were the ones who were supposed to benefit from all these wonderful policies and their lives were still largely miserable.

But even if everything you said were true, it still wouldn't be worth the price of marching through occupied lands, stealing food, burning homes, killing families.

You want a dose of reality? Try reading SS officer August Hafner's first-hand account of the murder of nearly 100 children - most younger than 6 - in Byelaya Tserkow. You can also read Helmuth Groscurth's official report, in which he complains that the orphans should have been killed the instant that their parents were shot by the SS. Instead they were left unsupervised in a locked building on the outskirts of town without food or water. The plan was to starve them but the wailing was keeping the troops awake.

This was not an isolated incident. Nor was it considered out of line with National Socialist ideology. You can read hundreds of similar reports.

But please, link me to some shallow YouTube videos showering the Nazis with praise and claiming they were misunderstood. I'm sure they're very entertaining. "

He deserves far more respect than Core devs. He may have tried to falsely claim to be Satoshi, but he represents Satoshi's vision far better than those who abuse Bitcoin.
Hear, hear. CW is **Fake**Satoshi
See now that's a fair argument. What you're saying is that poor people should transact with a cheaper crypto. I can see the sense in that. 
Sometimes CSW doesn't even use words, some sort of similar gibberish.
He is still understands Bitcoin better than the corrupt Core devs.

">If full nodes won't relay your transactions, you can't make any.
>
>If full nodes won't relay your blocks, you can't mine any.

You forget that miners are also full nodes and the largest miners participate in a global ultrafast relay network.

If one miner mines a block, all miners get it, whether or not a bunch of UASF full nodes agree. 

If one miner receives a transaction, all miners receive that transaction, whether or not a bunch of UASF full nodes agree.

UASF nodes do have the ability to get in the way of users by launching Sybil attacks against the network; pretending to be an impartial relay, but in reality engaging in censorship of transactions and blocks produced by real users and real miners. If enough of these cheap UASF ""full"" nodes clog up the network, it can be harder for real users to find real mining nodes who can validate their tx and get it into a block. "
Miners are full nodes and will be more than happy to relay them.
""" the potential damage one could cause is small – though enough that it cause a panic that would seriously threaten bitcoin’s use as a currency. At current network mining difficulty levels, not even large-scale governments could easily mount a 51% attack.""

So... small damage and not even a large government could pull it off. 

And isn't the mining hash difficultly getting harder all the time ? so the possibility of this is declining over time right? (though I guess global computational power is also rising over time so maybe it's a balance)"
I think you are talking about a 51% attack, and that can only happen with mining hash rate, not by holding 50% of all BTC. 50% of currency would be hella expensive and do nothing more than to increase demand trying to get to that point.

"> some actually did.

No, they didn’t. Jon Matonis claims that he met Craig at some conference and couldn’t shake the feeling that he’d just met Satoshi. But that was almost certainly the start of Craig’s con. That’s what con artists *do*. They lead people down a path, telling them what they want to hear, making them feel like they are in the driving seat. Jon Matonis got scammed. Gavin got scammed. Anyone in this community who still gives Craig the benefit of the doubt is likely to pay for that naivety at some point in the future."
"Where in that timeline does Craig go to major media outlets with fake cryptographic proof that he was Satoshi? Because note that after Gavin had relayed the story of the convoluted “proof” Craig offered him, most people with common sense already suspected Craig was a fraud. There was no rational reason for the theatrics he had insisted on.

So does it go like this:  

* Craig provided his weirdly convoluted proof to Gavin.  

* Then realised he didn’t want the attention.  

* *Then* provided fake proof to the media to cement his status as an obvious conman.  

* Then went quiet for a while before coming back with a PR company, army of sockpuppets, and frequent more subtle hints that he still want people to believe he is Satoshi.

Or some other equally nonsensical series of events?"

This.
What do you mean, Satoshi's vision? Nowhere in the whitepaper does it say anything about some kind of vision.
Satoshi has amassed quite a fortune in Bitcoin.  Estimates are that he has a million bitcoins.  He could single handedly destroy his creation by dumping all his Bitcoins.  If he really thinks that BCH fulfills his vision, he could sell all hit BTC for BCH and it would probably be game over for most cryptocurrencies.
Pretty sure if somehow he re appeared core would use all their tools to disprove it and say that he is a scammer or hacker who took control of his mail addresses / accounts / keys.
This is very true.  The market for safe, low-cost transfer services through banks has been established for two decades, if not longer.  And even if there weren't and this was still the 90's, crypto-currencies would be competing with [Hawaladars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawala) who are established and trusted by whole communities who send money through them.

We will continue this atrocity propaganda, we will increase it until nobody will accept one good word from the Germans anymore, until everything is destroyed which might have upheld them sympathies in other countries, and until they will be so confused that they don’t know what to do anymore. When this is reached, when they begin to pollute their own nest, and this not reluctantly but with hasty willingness to obey the winners, only then the victory is complete. It will never be definite.

I this it is would be removed regardless who said it it. It just inconvenient fact for their propaganda of bitcoin being only store of value. 
See my other post. There are much chaeper and instant ways to send money to this poor country. Their economy depends on it so they literally have 100's of options. This moron was using a international wire transfer, the worst way to send money to any one. They don't have bank accounts because they are too complicated to use and serve no purpose when you can pick up your remittance from anywhere in the country. They would never fucking jump through the hoops I have to jump through to use crypto.

It's a false premise there are cheap and fast ways to send money both from outside of the Philippines and inside the Philippines. Very cheap and a hell of a lot more convenient the BCH/BTC whatever and no where near 40% fees. Total nonsense. I live in the Philippines (from America). The BTC/PHP rate given by the exchanges are shit anyway, even without fees. And yes, using a foreign ATM card from Charles Schwab is one of the best ways. No ATM fees (they refund them) and the exact Visa exchange rate which is very close to the wholesale, it doesn't get any better than this. www.transferwise.com is also great. Stop using supposedly disenfranchised poor people to promote crypto, it's nonsense. The people who don't have accounts here do so not because they can't, they just don't know any better and have no use for it often. They need education more than crypto fucking currency. Rookies. The idiot in that screenshot is using a standard wire transfer that's about the worst way to send money to anyone in any country. In the Philippines there are 100's of options better than this. In fact I don't even believe that poster really send money to his mother that way, EVERYONE here knows better ways than a freaking wire-transfer. Remittance is a way of life.

"If you don't understand the value proposition of the single most secure store of value ever, look at this survey of 1000 Americans: https://lendedu.com/blog/investing-in-bitcoin

You tell me where the economic majority will go. The markets are clear, BTC is the winner."
The market has decided that they rather want bitcoin to be a store of value.. I don't like it,  but that's just what it is.. But it is totally unacceptable to censor this sort of thing. 
The emotional reactions in the crypto currency community are so telling of why the market is insanely volatile. Great reason to not invest, thanks for clarifying!
they are cunts
actually this post isnt true. the rich need bitcoin as well. for now, they are allowed to make transfers. this may stop one day.
Wow.. that post sounded like it supported the fact that you can send funds for < $20...  That's pretty crazy censorship.
The solution to the problem of remittances is block chain which doesn’t require bitcoin, it can be solved with any international currency.
This is a use case that Ripple is working to solve with their technology and XRP.  They are already quite far down the line in this.   More competition in the space good, but BCH has a lot of catch up not only in this area but in speed as well.

how is r/bitcoin still not removed by reddit admins?!
i just sent a 10 sat/b transaction though
Replying a mere 8 words in this thread got me banned.  They are getting more and more thin skinned.  There are a lot of people there who think things are seriously wrong and are doubting and they are getting more and more desperate.  The more BCH continues to flourish the more pressure builds on them.  I can't see how they can contain this much longer.
A few days ago many reddit accounts were hacked and used to mass downvote posts in r/bitcoin and upvote posts here. I would say the admins' attention is now more here than there.
Well, what we call censorship is perfectly fine by reddit rules, it is really not fine when it comes to an open source community, and that's why r/btc exists.
"Humans have been mostly breeding with their own race for generations and the results are nonexistent.

You’re just spouting bullshit at this point. Your theory is self contradictory, and you’re just hand waving that away, so you don’t have to consider the inconsistencies.

You make claims, and don’t even attempt to back them up, but in your mind this is tantamount to proof. You’ve constructed your entire belief system around confirmation bias and pseudoscience. You say things like “this has never been disproven”, but when the proof against the claim is presented, you just ignore it and go on claiming it’s never been disproven.

I don’t know if you do these things intentionally, but if you are at all interested in actually figuring out what’s true, you have to be willing to look for evidence, beyond the evidence that agrees with you. Don’t assume things that agree with you are true, and don’t assume things that disagree with you are false. If you can’t do that, you will never be right about anything. You’ll just go on believing whatever random bullshit you learned as a child."

Because by and large the support base of bch are proceeding with bch as a seamless continuation of btc, from the point of the fork. Think Black Sabbath vs Heaven and Hell, a continuation of the familiar with a minor but contentious change. Going forward if the BCH guys were right and BTC goes the way of the dodo, they can simply retake the Bitcoin name.
Bitcoin cash arguably posses better technology than bitcoin (faster and cheaper), but still inferior capabilities to many other cryptocurrencies, thats true. But, technology is only one part of the value of a currency. Network size and potential may be even more important, and in that area Bitcoin cash does better than many others.
"> Let’s just say that you are correct. Of all the alt currencies out there, why Bitcoin Cash? There seems to be so many better alts to shill. I still do not understand the appeal of this one.

You would understand if you owned Bitcoin before August 1.  You would have BCH and realize it was just a continuation of your original investment in Bitcoin.

"You can see many common, real-world Monero transactions on that page. It indicates typical (non-coinbase) transactions in Monero are currently about 13kB each when using a ring size of 5. Right now the median size of a Bitcoin transaction is 226 bytes, so 13,000 / 226 = 57.522.... This means that all the trouble Bitcoin (SegWit) is encountering with scaling right now could happen roughly 57.5x faster on the Monero network as usage grows.  

To be fair, though, Monero does not self-impose a ridiculous 1 MB block size limit, and they are not afraid of hard forks as they have them regularly scheduled every six months.  

So it boils down to how big a problem you think scaling is. In Bitcoin, Blockstream and Bitcoin Core will have you believe that it's a major incoming disaster. If that's true, then it's also about 57.5x worse for Monero.  

On the other hand, Ethereum, Monero, and Bitcoin Cash will all apparently permit on-chain scaling to grow much as Satoshi Nakamoto originally intended for Bitcoin. With the growth of technological capability over time, there might never be scaling problems for any of the three. But if transaction growth exceeds the increases from technological improvement and possible protocol innovations (and layer 2, etc.), scaling still could be a problem even with on-chain block size increases allowed. Of the three Bitcoin Cash has the leanest transaction sizes, followed by Ethereum (as it must include overhead to be a ""decentralized platform for applications"" rather than just ""A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System""), but Monero is significantly larger than either. Even on Ethereum, [data growth is starting to be a concern as compared to Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash](https://i.stack.imgur.com/W0DJu.png).  

e: corrected kb to kB  

e2: TL;DR: Bitcoin Cash currently has the best chance to scale on-chain (assuming there will ever be scaling difficulties, which may be facts not in evidence)."
These are fair examples though all of them, as you rightfully acknowledge are about petty cash. If the transaction fees are too high then these situations wouldn't exist at all.

Noob warning. U don't have to answer, but what in this link illustrates Monero's issue with scaling. I like that coin so I am curious. But I am not technical. Thanks! 
I wasn't aware of that.  Of course many coins could add that functionality, but most do not.   Bitcoin (core) can't even add larger block size, so can't see them ever doing anything else useful either.
I probably do focus on marketcap too much, but it does matter to some degree.  However I agree it is not the only significant metric for how successful a coin is, and far from it.
Ethereum is not an anonymous cryptocurrency, which is what we were discussing.
I don't disagree with that and XMR is my largest holding.  The anonymous crypto coins are still probably undervalued.  Governments will regulate and crack down more and more and blockchain analysis will be part of that so anonymous is the way to go.
"Thank you. Only productivity can solve inequality. Not ethical capitalism. Not redistribution (or re-redistribution as they call it). Crypto alone cannot be viewed as a panacea. It can act as a lubricant but without actual productivity, it cannot solve much in this respect.

One might want to note that, it is this kind of thinking that led to justification of taxes and when that wasn't enough another tax was invented by way of inflation. Crypto was built specifically to curb that shenanigans. 

Also, it says a lot that both theymos and memorydealers are both pro austrian school. At the end of the day, the real enemy is fiat and the  political elite/demagogues."

Privacy doesn't require anonymity. True anonymity offers no benefits that pseudonymity doesn't have. Besides, there is no anonymity if you are transacting with a person and if you are willing to send money to a completely anonymous entity, then you risk simply throwing money away anyway. I'm not saying there isn't some use case for anonymous value trading, but I haven't seen one.
"to prevent coercion from more powerful people/groups among other things, these examples are pretty hyperbolic but

"> Industry standard

There's your problem right there. And further reading turns up this gem:

>Though most banks offer this facility free of cost to encourage paperless payment system, ICICI bank and Axis bank charge for it as per their respective NEFT charges.

Again though, IMPS seems to be a system that, like all the Indian systems, relies on RTGS which is not 24/7?

So to be able to use IMPS, you are relying on the bank being able to access the other systems as well. It is a layer that requires trust to exist BETWEEN BANKS. If there's a crisis of some kind, and the banks refuse to deal with each other, IMPS will be one of the first services to get switched off.

Everything is layers on layers and different from bank to bank. There are fees and costs, it's just that in India with a BILLION possible customers, the banks can eat the fees in return for giving customers shit interest rates and nickel-and-dime-ing everying else.

Please don't be fooled by the banks. Bitcoin needs to address its costs and transaction times, but at least the TRUE COST is (almost) completely transparent (my understanding is that block rewards currently subsidise the small transactions anyway).

"Blocks must never be full. If they are, the network is broken/crippled. And thus miners do not get to pick and choose, they include as much tx as they can to get as much profit as possible in case they actually mine a block.

Cheers! *clink*
"A) True. The value transacted has no relevance. That's like saying if you pull $300 out of an ATM, the $5 transactions fee is only 1.66%.

B) We can see fees greater than $40 that are occurring literally right now: https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/transactions?q=fee_usd(40..)

C) That you had a transaction that cost $1.27 as something ok is weird. Even that ""small"" fee destroys a ton of blockchain business's models. These same models that grew the network triggering Metcalf's law.

>Even at the height of the first BCH pump, when the BTC mempool was absolutely jammed, the largest fee I had to pay was $18.

Again, this is just the beginning. Unless people aren't transacting (simply buying and keeping on exchanges which seems to be a reasonable thing for most recent ""investors"") this scenario is just going to go up, and by the narrative coming from core dev's and uncensored voices, is by design: higher is better.

>But the argument is made that this is the permanent, eternal fee, and that no one will be able to use Bitcoin at all without pay $40 in transaction fees and that's not true, and saying that obscures the real problem and the real debate.

I disagree. This is the inevitable result of full blocks. "

You folks really put a lot of faith in kludges.

"> Bitcoin Cash actually uses the BIP143 (quadratic hashing) fix for all transactions, so there! :P

Indeed, which is a very nice improvement but in Bitcoin since non-segwit txn are limited to 1MB by consensus (and 100KB by standardness rules) it doesn't make a critical difference.  (N^2 isn't a big deal when N is small).  Over time, most signatures in Bitcoin will eventually use segwit.  Bitcoin survived thus far with the quadratic stuff combined with the old limit, it'll be fine to phase it in over time.

The cost of that change is that they had to invalidate all timelocked transactions, which cost some people their coins on the fork.  That isn't something Bitcoin could have realistically done, at least not without a really long warning period."

"Jesus Christ the more I read up on this the more byzantine it becomes. RTGS seems to be the original system that got all this craziness rolling. 

As far as I can tell, India's problem is that along with its billion people it also seems to have about a billion banks! And these systems have become essential to keep the money moving around at all since without them it would get choked to death by bureaucracy (and we all know about India and bureaucracy!).

You seem fixated on whether or not a service is *truly* instant or is *really* available 24/7... me, I'd be more worried about how IMPS is operated and co-ordinated by a single corporation:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Payments_Corporation_of_India

I mean sure it's nationalised to some extent and it's not-for-profit (ha - I'm more interested in the ""owned by a consortium of major banks"" part) but just look at the mess of different systems: there's the ""National Automated Clearing House"" and the ""Aadhaar Payments Bridge System"" and the ""Cheque Truncation System"" and RuPay and the ""Unified Payments Interface""...

This last one appears to be the backbone of the government's push to make India a ""cashless society"" (presumably whether India wants to be or not), and this description of UPI should send shivers up the spine of anyone who is not a superfan of central banks:

>UPI is built over Immediate Payment Service (IMPS) for transferring funds. Being a digital payment system it is available 24*7 and across public holidays. Unlike traditional mobile wallets, which takes a specified amount of money from user and stores it in its own accounts, UPI withdraws and deposits funds directly from the bank account whenever a transaction is requested. It uses Virtual Payment Address (a unique ID provided by the bank), Account Number with IFS Code, Mobile Number with MMID (Mobile Money Identifier), Aadhaar Number, or a one-time use Virtual ID. An MPIN (Mobile banking Personal Identification number) is required to confirm each payment.

Fuck. That.

So once again, you the customer think you are getting real instant transfers of your money, but this only works because a ""consortium of major banks"" has agreed to be part of a central corporation that manages it all. It's like the surface-level functionality of crypto with a philosophy that is almost satirically antithetical to it.

Okay, *fine*, if it's important to you - I will allow that in India the push for a cashless society by the government (and I assume the banks) is so strong that the level of trust between the different banks has reached a level where the distinction between ""handing someone a bag of cash"" and using one of these ""instant"" transfer services is now so small that we might as well say these transactions truly are instant.

But it relies on banks being in a *consortium* to work. It relies on centralisation. And even if the NPCI is ""not for profit"", its members are *banks*..."

"**National Payments Corporation of India**

National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI, Hindi: भारतीय राष्ट्रीय भुगतान निगम) is the umbrella organisation for all retail payment systems in India, which aims to allow all Indian citizens to have unrestricted access to e-payment services.

Founded in 2008, NPCI is a not-for-profit organisation registered under section 8 of the Companies Act 2013. The organisation is owned by a consortium of major banks, and has been promoted by the country’s central bank, the Reserve Bank of India. Its recent work of developing Unified Payments Interface aims to move India to a cashless society with only digital transactions.

"Interesting.  Here we see Greg Maxwell backtracking on quadratic hashing. 

Prediction: Core decides to increase the block size limit for BTC from 1 MB to something greater in the next 12 months as BCH gains dominance, and Greg backtracks on the risks of bigger blocks in a similar fashion.

(Of course we all know that the network can indeed handle significantly bigger blocks, so I welcome this eventual capitulation to common sense by Mr. Maxwell). "
4M weight. If you want a size in bytes it's 4Mb but it would take a fairly contrived transaction mix to get close to this in practice.
Oh yes and my node still only gets 1MB blocks. 
"You can refuse to answer the question by pretending that every single transaction is a segwit transaction in some twisted illogical way, but it would be more beneficial to you if you didn't. So let's try this again in a way that you might be able to understand.

If the weight limit on the BTC blockchain was changed to 8 million units, and a 4 million weight limit chain no longer existed from today onwards, would you stop developing for bitcoin?"
"> I don't know what you mean by ""proposed fork title"" but maybe this blurb written a couple months after the Alpha launch (check the git history) would satisfy it?

Just look at the eyes on this code it's highly centralized and a non starter.

"
Really?  How big is it then?
"> stated the parameter change of 1MB maximum blocksize limit

There is no such parameter in Bitcoin. The blocksize limit was eliminated completely and replaced with a 4 million unit weight limit.

> Answer my question.

LOL."
"Yes, Elements Alpha is a fork of Core. Though to be clear, the blockchains are completely separate.

I have no idea how you can say ""I can't read code"" but then claim that the linked code for the segwit HF isn't what I said it is.

I don't know what you mean by ""proposed fork title"" but maybe [this blurb](https://github.com/ElementsProject/elementsproject.org/blob/master/source/elements/segregated-witness/index.md) written a couple months after the Alpha launch (check the git history) would satisfy it?
"
This prediction literally cannot come true because there is no 1Mb limit to increase from.
"He should change his name to Consensus, so in future when he says limited to one megabyte by Consensus he won't be obviously lying.

Nobody else in this entire debate makes me quite as annoyed as this guy. "
Sigh... bitcoin’s block size is already bigger than 1 MB.  Please don’t demagogue the issue. 
"You just lied by omitting the fact that I specifically stated the parameter change of 1MB maximum blocksize limit. Note how I did not say ""if blocks are bigger than 1MB"" or anything of the sort. Answer my question."

"It appears to be possible to recover your coins in those cases if you have all the needed information:

I agree that it is worrying that little things like that seem to get over-looked. (another annoying thing is Bitcoin ABC did not actually properly re-enable 0 fee transactions by default -> points to documentation problems).

"**Triple modular redundancy**

In computing, triple modular redundancy, sometimes called triple-mode redundancy, (TMR) is a fault-tolerant form of N-modular redundancy, in which three systems perform a process and that result is processed by a majority-voting system to produce a single output. If any one of the three systems fails, the other two systems can correct and mask the fault.

The TMR concept can be applied to many forms of redundancy, such as software redundancy in the form of N-version programming, and is commonly found in fault-tolerant computer systems.

Some ECC memory uses triple modular redundancy hardware (rather than the more common Hamming code), because triple modular redundancy hardware is faster than Hamming error correction software.

Ambitious, creative entrepreneurs need to tap into using Bitcoin to monetize user generated content.  For example, for every upvote, Reddit users could be earning a satoshi or two.
Oh yeah! I saw YouTube video on that.  The freedom is definitely exciting. I can only imagine how the future will be shaped by tech like crypto. 
Why are we discussing anonymous cryptocurrency?
"How about ring mixing contracts like this:

https://github.com/blackyblack/laundromat

Ethereum allows also anonymity, for the receiver."
"well i don't.  long term, market cap is everything, because market cap ultimately defines how much security and developer attention you're going to get.

the coin with the most users should get the most security from adoption-driven market gains, will attract the most attention, the most devs, and the most actual money utility through Metcalfe's law.

I agree that you can't judge a coin's future success on its historical market cap; I disagree that this somehow makes market cap unimportant.  It's arguably the single most important feature in a money, which is why the kneecapped and ball-gagged BTC continues to remain relevant to the point of sucking up most of the air in the room"
This is just wrong. Pseudonymity creates linkability and metadata about yourself. Sending money to an anonymous entity is different than being able to send it anonymously. Why would you be sending money to an anonymous entity? What purpose does that ever serve?

Good thing if people ever decide transaction malleability is an actual problem we can fix it in a nice clean hard fork and not a sloppy soft fork like the segregated witness that was wholly rejected on its own merits.
"yeah true its sort of cart before the horse; we'd need to address the current limitations to usability before we get into the problems of use

beyond the issues of fees/mempool glut we have to consider things like generally poor internet infrastructure & govts with extensive control over a country's internet that could make reliably connecting to the bitcoin network near-to-impossible too"
Bullshit. Give me numbers
"Very few people would need to be compromised to attempt to change bitcoin cash. This is good. This is by design. There is no core team that releases ""the"" single official release.

This makes the overall system better. With multiple teams writing multiple software variants, you get the benefits of system redundancy:

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_modular_redundancy

Having a core software team which releases the one and only version, may not be as safe as you think."
"IMPS is 24/7 but only because the other systems exist. 

Do you see what I'm getting at? That ""fast"" transfers bank-to-bank are essentially an *illusion*. Sure, you the customer get access to the money right away, but really you are spending money your bank has ""borrowed"" (or ""leant you"") on the expectation that the other bank will honour the transaction when the settlement occurs.

I will mea culpa on the fact that some of these system do settle more often than once per day. But, as far as I cant tell, it's still slower than even BTC (on the days BTC has not had 40% of its hashrate go to another coin).

There are two arguments against crypto generally that annoy me:

1. That VISA is much faster. Of course it is, it is a layer-on-a-layer.

2. That ""MY bank does free instant transfers"". No, it doesn't, not really. 

Because of the way crypto is designed, the transactions don't happen until they *really* happen. You are never going to find yourself in a situation where a single party says ""yeah... that 'instant' service... we're not doing that anymore because it's not profitable enough.""

The hated Core isn't deliberately *slowing down* transactions. At worst they are refusing to act quickly to speed them up.

Transaction times and costs will fluctuate according to real market forces. Unless we, in our rush to speed up and further cheapen txs, allow semi-centralisation.

The priority should NOT be ""faster cheaper transactions TODAY"". It should be ""ensure decentralisation and trustlessness is maintained at maximal possible values, at all times."""
Jihan would be enough.
Because someone brought up the topic and I responded to it and others did as well.   I know why we are discussing it, because it is interesting and valuable.  I don't know why you are discussing it.
"Ethereum's goal in life is not to be a money, but to enable ""distributed logic"" and if it achieves its goal in life, it's unclear how well its ""money use case"" will continue to work."
I'm not talking about some smart contract.  I'm talking sending ETH from one person to another, simple and it being anonymous.  And for both the sender and receiver of course.  That does sound interesting though.
There will always be linkabilty and metadata. We live in a surveillance society. You can't use technology by itself to solve social issues. Cryptocurrencies are not the goal, they are a step towards something better someday. Baby steps. No free society will want a completely anonymous currency. Sure, people want guns for protection, but should we allow private ownership of platform nuclear satellites? Maybe someday, but not yet.
What about Monero's forks like etn and I think dashcoin(DSH)? They are anon too right?
Ok, you know more than me and I really should research it more.  But yes XMR has had huge gains this year, but certainly room for more.
This is correct. For example, anonymity is optional in zcash, and only a tiny fraction of transactions use it. So the ones that do stick out. That is bad. 
"By who? For what? Who does it affect?

A decentralized payment system would allow me to send funds to my family, or the other way around l, instantly and cheap. To normal hardworking people.

"You know we wrote segwit as a hardfork first-- the version we went with is cleaner than the hardfork.   -- so much so that we changed elements to work in the same way, although there is no prior system to mandate that.

And as far as ""if"" -- half the changes in the latest BCH hardfork were importing more half-measure malleability fixes from Core,  pretty big admission that it's an actual issue; if viabtc shutting down deposit and withdraw weren't enough for you.

Sorry for the inconvenient truth."
i could be wrong on this but i assumed the majority of txs in the block would have been simple wallet to wallet daily use
"I'm sorry, you're moving goalposts faster than you type.

Anyways: If we ever reach 150m tx a day, adoption and thus demand would have increased dramatically. We'd probably have to start splitting up satoshis because the coin itself will be so expensive.
With increased coin value, miners also get increased fee value and reward value.

You were talking about ""zero fees"". Where did get the idea that small fees are zero fees?
1sat/byte is not equal to 0sat/byte.

Profitability compared to another coin is another topic which I'm not going to discuss with you as it is highly speculative.

We're not running 150m tx a day TODAY. But research showed even Gigabyte blocks are possible with current hardware.

Again, harddrives are your least problem if you're mining with gigawatts of ASIC miners. This is what Satoshi predicted (miners will have large datacenters)."
"You realize that Bitcoin Unlimited and nChain are currently testing 1GB blocks, right?

It is no problem for a mid-high end computer right now. It will be no problem for a low-end computer 10 years from now, when we actually need that much volume."

"Look up zero-conf. It's near-instant confirmation. Available in BCH but not BTC.

Also look up bitcoin ATMs and localbitcoins. These things *are* being done, but we're still in the early phases."
That's why I say your statements are factually inaccurate. IMPS is separate from RTGS/NEFT. And it is instantaneous.
I've been using my cards abroad for decades, so I don't think that's very likely...

"Ask 95% miner upgrade to Segwit version. Congestion n fee will drop:

What are the benefits of SegWit?

The most obvious benefit is a slight capacity increase. The elimination of unwanted transaction malleability is an important one. This was more of a nuisance bug as opposed to a critical bug. Other benefits include:

Weighting data based on how it affects node performanceSignature covers valueLinear scaling of sighash operationsIncreased security for multisigMore efficient almost-full-node securityScript versioningHow does it get implemented?

The way it gets “activated” is interesting. It requires 95% of miners to signal support for SegWit and for full nodes to upgrade to the latest version to include SegWit which is v0.13.1

The segwit soft fork has been designed to allow individuals in both groups to voluntarily decide whether or not they want to adopt segwit

For miners, there is a 1 year window starting from 15 November 2016 where miners can place a bit value of 1 in the blockheader version bits field.

The amount of support is constantly measured but will only activate if 95% of support is measured in a ~2 week period called the 2,016-block retarget period.

What is the current status?

There is a neat site called http://www.segwit.cowhere you can monitor the status. Currently there is about a 25% uptake since 15 November.

Summary

SegWit is a neat invention that the bitcoin core community put a lot of effort in because it provides positive fundamental changes to the bitcoin platform. It takes non-critical data out of the transaction to reduce the size (increasing throughput) along with other benefits.

The funny thing is all the money is going to miners whom Core despises so much
"I think sovereignty needs to be defined. You can imagine a coin where you have what seems to be full sovereignty, yet the wires are been pulled by big players. In this regard, remember that even current fiat money seems to present some sort of sovereignty, yet it is being controlled by the state. Therefore, it lacks what bitcoiners would want to see in a decentralized coin. 

What I mean to say by this is quite simple: low fees does not translate to sovereignty by definition. It is actually just a property of the coin. 

So you might argue that the most sovereignty-giving coin is the one where control is dispersed by as many actors as possible - to a level where no single entity can change fundamental properties of this coin. By fundamental properties you would not consider fees to be one of these fundamental properties. This is an important distinction! 

For some, and I fully understand why, it may seem that high fees means your sovereignty is being compromised. But I believe this is not the case. Sovereignty means that no part in the system can take away control (in any way) if your ownership. This is the fundamental property of the coin you would desire the most. 

Think about it in an historical perspective. People were most vulnerable when they lack the ability to hold onto their ownership. States used to defragment people's ownership in order to disenfranchise that group. 

One can illustrate this differentiation between fees and ownership in ownership of a house. Any change in ownership to the house is cumbersome and expensive - requires the collaboration of multiple entities and professionals (licensed by the state). This is because home ownership is one of the most important assets a person can own - and therefore any damage to this ownership erodes a person's ability to remain sovereign against outside forces. 

I think at the heart of the issue, then, is the question of which property of the coin is fundamental to ownership. True ownership - not fake one. Not masked ownership. 

It is my humble opinion that fees (meant to accommodate the transfer of ownership) are not a fundamental property of ownership.

"The transfer isn't really free. The bank pays a LOT of money to make a large transfer at the end of the day. It is an example of the most likely solution to crypto's scaling - a secondary layer.

With a bank, when you receive an ""instant free transfer"" from another account, then both banks (the sender and your bank) trust each other to ""settle"" that account at the end of the day.

They let you spend that money from your account, even though *the real money* has not yet moved from the payer to the payee.

Now I don't know every bank in India, maybe there are some banks that settle instantly, but the point is that you are relying on these banks to move your money around and they profit from this. They can change this deal at any time - maybe the day you finally need to move some big money, they introduce a 2% fee. You can't know! You have to trust them! *You have to trust banks!!*

The advantage of both BCH and BTC is that when a transaction is confirmed, that is it. The ""money"" is now at the new address, no more waiting, no third parties to settle."

"In fairness though, until merchants adopt crypto universally, or traders that swap cash for crypto become commonplace, cheap transaction fees arent going to make any difference.

A poor person still needs cash, so they need an infrastructure supporting crypto as well as cheap transaction costs (which they have anyway through ETH, LTC, BCH, etc, etc). 

What poor people need for remittance is a service like Western Union. "

And wtf are you talking about they are sending from the Philippines to their family abroad? That doesn't happen much. It's the rich person abroad making way more the $100 sending money to their family in PH which can be done for a very low cost and high speed. To send inside and between people in the Philippines is very cheap and instant. You are trying to solve a problem that doesn't exist here in the Philippines."
"> It can be $40... to send remittance... when they earn $100 a month

My issue with this whole debate is not the right or wrong of it, it's the constant exaggeration.

Even at the height of the first BCH pump, when the BTC mempool was absolutely jammed, the largest fee I had to pay was $18. 

Is $18 too much for poor people? Probably yes it is. Should something be done about this? Yes of course it should.

But exaggerating constantly and claiming fees are twice as high as they really are, just makes people dismiss your argument. Yes, you *can* absolutely send a tx with a $40  fee if you're mad enough and you demand your tx to be included in the next block. But why would a poor person need that transfer to be so fast? Why wouldn't they be happy to wait a day or two?

Because, also during that mempool ""crisis"" the other day, I also accidentally sent a tx with a ridiculously low fee of a little over a dollar. I sent that tx on a Saturday afternoon, and it was confirmed into my wallet by Monday morning.

That's slow for Bitcoin, but it's still faster than any bank in my country. Any tx sent via a bank on a Saturday would not clear until the following Tuesday.

There's an argument to be made about transaction costs and speed, but come on. Let's at least be honest about it."
I don't understand all those whines about BTC over price and rediculous fee. There are plenty available to replace same purpose. BCH, ETH, LTC, IOTA, RPX etc. All we need is less stubborn wired our brain fixed to BTC. Help spread those alternatives. 
Craig is clearly in it for the common good of mankind- NOT for the money. 
"I really like this sentiment, but as a rich person with a bank account and credit cards, tech education, easy access to the internet etc, it has been quite difficult for me to procure BCH.

Right now to buy it i have to go to a place online where I can buy a different crypto and exchange it for BCH. I don't even want to think about what it will take to enchange it for goods. I keep hearing ""Yes but that will change"" okay, How?

I am a religious Leader in Florida. I want to help the poor in Puerto Rico and Haiti. I know that creating paths to self sufficiency is more effective than handouts. I can afford to make some trips there and hire some people to do stuff. How do I get BCH access for these people?

"Actually ... isn't this is what Stellar was made for? Don't get me wrong I like Bitcoin (Cash) I am not a BTC fan at all, but for 3rd World usage it's all Stellar. A 45c transfer fee is 24% of the daily income of someone living on $1.90 per day. 

For Lumens the transfer fee is ~ 0.00002 XLM per transaction. Let's just say 0.0007c

That may not mean much to someone in the 1st world, but a world of difference to the 767 million people lived on less than $1.90 a day."
"Question:  Was Wright’s scheme of claiming to be Satoshi simply to try to poke the real Satoshi out of hiding?

I think we all agree on this. Just a noob's question: we now have coins that are even cheaper to move than BCH. In a world where what is important (in terms of remittance) is the cheapest way to send, aren't there better alternatives? Why is BCH even needed? 
Did you mean bitcoin has no fees an no border?  I guess I need some fees to get cash in my hands.

"Ok. A warning before reading my post. Crypto investment is always risky. Its a high risk, high reward type of investment. There is a small chance you will double or even triple your investment if you buy it right and there is a major chance that you will completely lose your money. 

So if you have a  long term view, then I recommend you diversify your investment in BTC, BCH, LSK, VTC, LTC, and some of those top 20 coins based on market value. 

Now, the important thing here is to get the very best rate for each of these coins. And have the will power to hold the currency when it is at a loss. 

Buy BTC for 50% of your total money. 25% of your investment on BCH and the rest on other coins. 

Now set aside half of your BTC budget and buy it at current market rates. And then set a buy order for BTC at  [Current BTC rate -10%] And again, set another BTC buy order for [current BTC rate-20%]

Keep in mind, crypto markets are extremely volatile so have a minimum of a month long view before doing a stop loss order. for example, I lost 70% of my investment for 10 days but it then rebounded back to 165% profit. I sold it during that time, but if I kept that for a few more days, it might be 250% profit. 

Get a trading basics book and learn how to read candlelight charts.

If you keep your long game as a main focus, you will end up profiting in the end. There are way too many noobs looking for get rick quick type investments so don't bother trying to compete with them.  

Also remember, this advice only applies to crypto currencies that has high volume in trading. Cryptocurrencies with less than $5 million volume are even more risky. In those investments, you lose a huge % of your money or make a huge profit occasionally, so its best to keep these investments to around $100 or something. "
"Correct. Also, bitcoin is neutral. The tech in no way is evil.

It could be argued that letting fees go up as they have is forgetting about those who used it for small values. In some places, bitcoin was superior to their local currency since their local currency was losing purchasing power quickly.

However, as fees increase that superiority is reduced. In fact it could be that dealing with low value bitcoin transactions is less economical than holding onto a currency that is losing 50% value in a year.

While technically ""permissionless"", right now you must pay to use it. Therefore it is no longer permissionless."

We know how to batch transactions and be as efficient as possible, as we have been doing this for almost four years now. The bulk of Rebit's volume is from the south korean corridor, where our customers don't even know they are using Bitcoin. Their receivers also don't know anything about Bitcoin, yet they save money on fees by using our service compared to Western Union or banks. 

Our transaction volumes are at an all-time high across the SCI platform. Bitcoin sales on Buybitcoin.ph are through the roof. That being said, we are working on supporting BCash for our Bitbit.ph wallet users who are holding BTC. You can use BCH on Rebit right now, but through Shapeshift. As much as I personally disagree with Bcash, our business is agnostic to the tech and will support whatever has demand.

"> bigger blocks is a scaling solution

Bigger blocks destroy the core feature of Bitcoin which is decentralization. Look at BCH: 1 miner (Jihan), 1 dev (deadalnix), 1 'entrepreneur' (Ver) and a the clown-car driver  (fakesatoshi)

Please understand: Bitcoin does not mean that YOU get what YOU think is right atm. "
"I'm not holding my breath for it. BCH works just fine now.

But, if LN does happen and it magically doesn't make it harder to use, and it is adopted well... hey, that's great! LN type 2nd layer could be added to BCH if it proves viable tech. If people choose to use it, or choose to use the main chain, that's up to them. I just don't want to see that choice be made for them by a substantial fee delta."
To add to that...  Pretty sure Blockstream has patents on LN with the malleabilty fix.  Yours.org has already created a sidechain network without the malleability fix.  I think it’s trivial in comparison, the issue is Blockstream cannot license it without the malleability “fix”.  And btw, it’s not really even a “fix”, nothing is broken...  has just been painted as a “fix” for obvious reasons.

Yes you're right. Haven't used them in years. Oh well, in that case WorldRemit will eat their lunch unless they adapt.
Not in this circumstance, the exchange rate was locked at time of tx initiation. 
"Again the point is ignored - fees are high, that is objectively true. But it does not cost $40 to send $100. It has never been that expensive*. And the longest I've had to wait for a transaction was 36 hours, in the middle of a giant fooferaw with BCH and ""stolen hash rate"" and other bullshit.

The last TX I did, even though Coinbase warned me of ""high fees and long transaction times"" cost $1.27 and took 8 minutes.

Is that too slow/expensive for day to day commerce? Yes. Does the ability for me to extract over $500 worth of Bitcoin from Coinbase into my own wallet where I now control it, worth $1.27 and eight minutes? 

I think it is.

*I will note that it is possible to set your fee to $40 to tx $100 and there have been times when such a fee would have guaranteed you a space in the next block because every other panicker was only paying $25. But the argument is made that this is the permanent, eternal fee, and that no one will be able to use Bitcoin at all without pay $40 in transaction fees and that's not true, and saying that obscures the real problem and the real debate."

Bitcoin is designed the way that miners decide if they want to put your transaction in a block. You can broadcast a transaction with 0 fees. With a network that processes 150m transactions per day, would you be happy to run a node for free? What will happen? Miners charge 1 cent? 2cent? 20cent? 1$?
"I just checked LocalBitcoins, and it shows 2.02 USD (0.00025004 BTC) outgoing fee. Still way too high, but nowhere near 40 USD. 

I agree that fees are too high, but it's important not to be deceptive or sensationalist. "
"...how?

Like buying crypto in the two thirds world for local currency?

1) How does one even go about that? I hand them cash after I look at their smartphone poised to transfer?

2) Where do I find crypto owners in the nations where crypto can neither be bought nor sold for their currency? Where did they get it from?"
"No my post is saying, if you want to make a point about high fees, which are high there is no debate about that, then you must be *honest* and give *actual* costs.

Not ""if things keep going the way they are..."" or ""it is possible that a situation could exist where..."".

It is not currently necessary to pay $40 to transact $100 worth of Bitcoin. That is *not true*.

You must explain your point about the cost of transactions, and you must listen to the opposing point which is that, in the vast majority of cases, transacting moderate to large sums of money, especially internationally, using Bitcoin, is much cheaper than almost any other method.

Yes, Bitcoin Cash is cheaper again - at the moment. But questions remain around the nature of the solution and around the decentralisation of BCH. You can't just angrily say that Core has betrayed the blah blah censorship etc. Reddit is not the world. 

To suggest that the world's most highly valued cryptocurrency should be *immediately destroyed* because a solution to high fees has not been implemented on a schedule that suits you, is... well, it's grotesque is what it is (I am not saying YOU the person who posted above me thinks this, but many do). 

Both systems should be considered and should find their appropriate uses. They should not be ""at war"". There's no need for it.

Something that people who cite ""VISA"" or ""muh bank transfers"" must accept that the ""free and instant"" bank transfers that their bank may offer are not really free or instant and you must rely on your bank AND the receiving bank to honour the transfer. 

Right now, the banks do honour transfers. But you are reliant on a third party.

As for VISA, it is a layer on top of a layer, and you should talk to merchants about how much VISA benefits their business. Some will say enormously, some will grit their teeth. Some will fold their arms and say ""CASH ONLY.""

Nothing real in the world can happen for free. The people operating the Bitcoin (and any crypto) network cannot be expected to work for free, and the block reward is not enough.

The question is to develop a system that, as many say, can scale to billions of people and remain cheap, but which does not make us reliant on a small group of hardware operators.

Whether you support BCH or BTC or are objective, you must see that it is UNACCEPTABLE that the question of ""will hash power go to X or to Y"" even exists.

The system should be built in such a way that no group can affect it to any significant or meaningful degree."
To be clear, I'm a believer in more ethical capitalism, where everyone's incentivized to make the best out of what they have but no one's left behind. For instance, making a great invention to raise the standard of living and making money off of it. I see cryptocurrency as a tool to enable this and break free from central control.

"Can't is a strong word. Can't directly compete with visa? Maybe.. But it's currently more scalable than BTC. BCH doesn't prevent layer 2 scaling, either BTW. So for now, 2.4M transactions a day at low fee sounds fine to me. 420Gigs a year? That is not beyond reason. I have many years worth of extra space collecting dust right now.. literally.

Bring LN into the mix, then that's a different story. But even if that happens for BTC, again, this wouldn't be impossible on BCH."
"The point is that there has been a constant push for a few market which shows massive spikes *before people are really even using it*. Doesn’t bode well for actual use cases (which is why the narrative is “store of value” with no other real utility).

"This is either some sophisticated trolling, or you've just been *really* indoctrinated by Corey talking points.

">The issue with the bucket analogy is that inflation isn't ""leaking"" any value its just diluting it.

The holder of an inflationary money has less value over time so I think the ""leaking"" analogy works. But it's true that the value that leaks away goes somewhere. So maybe we could imagine that the floor that everyone is walking on is sloped toward a central drain which feeds the leaked water to another bucket (this bucket being owned by the entity that has a monopoly on making the leaky buckets).

>A deflationary currency discourages trade, but an inflationary currency doesn't discourage investment, it only discourages trying to store value in money. Since money has no value unless its being traded this is what you want from a currency. If you want to make money from an inflationary currency you have to invest it in something that makes money, you can't just sit around and wait for other peoples work to increase the value of your currency.

Consider the following:

https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6yui3r/bitcoin_is_deflationary_in_nature_and_will_fail/dmqlcgo/"
"Are you an engineer ? Do you actually contribute to the code ? 
Do you ever wonder why no credible engineers contribute to these alts ?

I just don't understand how you can be so confident from a position of such profound ignorance. ""Sharding"" is just another one of those words used to placate the suckers, there is no technology there."
"You may end up being wrong on all points. Also, sharding solves the ""you don't have to tell everyone"" issue, you don't seem to realize that even exists as an idea, but it would allow unlimited on-chain scaling. No lightning needed.

And to say putting a payment system on top of bitcoin will be easy is foolish, it will be hard."
"The issue with the bucket analogy is that inflation isn't ""leaking"" any value its just diluting it. 

Deflation isn't keeping any more value in the bucket, its just concentrating it, like evaporating a solution. 

Here's where the analogy breaks down. The value of currency comes from facilitating trade. People don't give a shit if their bucket solution becomes more concentrated, but people do care if their money keeps getting more valuable because they stop spending it as much.

A deflationary currency discourages trade, but an inflationary currency doesn't discourage investment, it only discourages trying to store value in money. Since money has no value unless its being traded this is what you want from a currency. If you want to make money from an inflationary currency you have to invest it in something that makes money, you can't just sit around and wait for other peoples work to increase the value of your currency."
">The holder of an inflationary money has less value over time so I think the ""leaking"" analogy works

Only if you assume centralized inflation (i.e. central banks/miners end up with all the new currency).

You can have inflation of the supply without moving around relative value. For example like with a stock split. If everyones shares are split in two, everyone still owns the same amount of value its just diluted into a larger number of shares.

Now it happens that you might want centralized inflation to work as an incentive system for miners/banks, but inflation as a raw concept does not require it.

The way bitcoins are produced actually does cause relative shifts in value (i.e. its concentrated in the hands of the miners, which i think is a great mistake because it creates an incentive for miners to increase the price of bitcoin rather than to try and maximize the number of transactions), although the supply is so limited that no one really minds since its still deflating overall.

>Consider the following: https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6yui3r/bitcoin_is_deflationary_in_nature_and_will_fail/dmqlcgo/

This has the same problem as every other pro-deflation argument I've seen (aside from ignoring the real world evidence that monetary deflation is terrible for economies, and the very immediate evidence that deflation is killing bitcoins use as currency), which is that it assumes there's only a binary choice between having an inflationary currency and a deflationary currency.

The idea that people have to consume so they'll still spend deflationary currency rather than save it only works if that's the only currency you have access to. If you have access to both deflationary and inflationary currency you never have any incentive to spend deflationary currency over the inflationary one. It's classic ""bad"" money pushing out good.

This is why we don't have any deflationary currencies anymore. It's why the entire world got off the gold standard. In the presence of a functional, low-inflation currency, deflationary currencies inevitably become assets or worthless, depending on whether it has any value when its not a currency.

All the pro-deflationist arguments still apply to gold but gold will never be a currency again because no one wants to spend it when you can spend other things that don't increase in value. Currency doesn't need to be a store of value. It only needs to facilitate trade, and mild inflation is far better at facilitating trade than mild deflation."

Like you know it's an intentional pump and dump with fake buy wall. Who do you think you are? 
how bitcoin can ”still” be a medium of exchange
Lol, you act like you know the motivations behind both the buy wall and price rise. Such hubris. You must indeed be a GameDeveloper. 
You can start by providing counter arguments otherwise you bring nothing to the discussion.
"Do you even have the ability to recognize a counter argument when you get it? I just gave you one ; you have no proof of a manipulated buy wall nor a pump and dump scheme. "
"Outside of the buy wall and the pump and dump which are both visible right now?

Lol, you're imputing motive. Do you really claim to know, clown? 
"I don't think you understand arguments. You are supposed to refute my evidence. Also ad hominem after ad hominem.

Bro do you even debate

What evidence? Your opinion? 
"Um no, if you look at the buy wall for BCH it sits right now at roughly ~800 USD and its 70 million dollars.

Also if you look at the graphs when last weekend happened you can see it was a giant spike. That is a pump and dump.

I would love to hear your rebuttal that will floor me now."
Are you listening to yourself? In your first comment you implied a directional motive to the wall and price ramp, that being manipulation as opposed to real interest. I'm still waiting for your proof, not observations. 
"But you didn't refute the fact that it the first attack is a pump. It went from 800 to 2800. You think that was natural? :D

This is kind of funny actually. So that was just normal every day free market being free? "
Traders see these types of spinning top configurations all the time. It's just from over exuberance. It doesn't have to be nefarious or manipulated. What's wrong with you? 
"800 to 2800 back to 1200 in a span of one night. Thats a pump and it ended with a dump. You are the one hanging out with your straw man acting like ""How dare you question the ethics of traders""

You have no argument. Do you want me to begin showing pictures of the event so you can understand it better. Big spikes where everyone sells at the end is a pump and dump. :D"
Again, you're imputing manipulation to the move. That's called hubris, if not outright stupidity on your part. End of story. 
No, that's only if you naively believe Bitcoin is nothing but code. 
Propping up god-tier cypherpunks over non-technical chads. Makes sense to me.
The pump and dump and the buy wall were starting points into it becoming a slow deterioration of BTC. That was pretty dirty play.
Which one is the altcoin is a matter of semantics.  There are many different coins, regardless of how you label them.  I don't like the censorship in r/Bitcoin but this place isn't exactly objective either.
Lack of immutability, scale and innovation. Charlie is copying Core roadmap
"Surely whatever coin is handling millions of small transactions on a daily basis will have to have a much higher hash rate than a coin that is handling a few thousands large transactions?

If you already have a coin that is handling millions of transactions then why would a few thousand large transactions cause it any problems.

Maybe there's a solid argument for it but I haven't heard one yet. Big banks don't have a separate currency for making large transactions they just have more secure channels for it."
Litecoin is less immutable and copies failed roadmap
"A gold coin always has utility. It can be used in electronics or fashioned into jewelry.

Bitcoin's only utility is as a trustless medium of exchange. Once it loses that, it has no value. If it has no value, it can't be a store of value either."

That may be right.  But if that's true, then bitcoin's problem could be solved by just increasing the block size, which I think will inevitably occur eventually.  Personally I don't think there should be a block size limit. 
Bitcoin Cash > Litecoin in immutability. That's solid enough: Bitcoin Cash velocity grows steadily
It's indicative of the mindset many users over there have. It gets upvoted to the top do to the echo chamber.
Lots of new dumb money
It depends on the timing though. At night the network is always less busy and fees are much lower than peak hours.
Soon the mempool will clear out, and they will praise segwit for this, when it will be due to lack of new transactions instead.
To teach someone about Bitcoin you teach them about an altcoin... that people must have sub 75 IQ if they defend that

Making a piece of electronics or jewelry is as interesting as reading the transaction chain. 
Bitcoin Old is no more a store of value than BCH.
"Had the same discussion... gave my kids like $10 in bitcoin as a gag years ago and just recently restored their wallet backup... OMG.

Then they got excited and wanted to do stuff with it, so I loaded Coinomi and sent them $10 in LTC....

Dad will hold on to the BTC... to keep it safe >:-}"
"> Bitcoin will be a settlement layer, valued for its high security and stability

I've heard this a lot but I've not yet seen a convincing argument why a functional cryptocurrency would need a settlement layer.

The original whitepaper mentions nothing about it, it seems entirely a post-hoc rationalization for why bitcoin is worth ever increasing amounts of money even though its failing to live up to its aim of being a functional currency."
I think it's possible that any currency that gains a large enough hash rate and market cap to be used for large transactions between institutions, will not be functional for small payments.  Just speculation though.
"it's the other way around. bitcoin's utility came from the ability to send any amount of money, small or large, to anywhere in the world with almost zero friction.  only bitcoin cash fully has that capability.

every time you do a bitcoin transaction, the miners take their cut. that actually breaks store of value and also medium of exchange.  2 / 4 properties of money gone."
You don't understand Bitcoin. Luckily there is Bitcoin Cash.
"> a chain of digital signatures.

LN is not a chain of digital signatures, neither is BlocksTreamCoin"
the signature is [not inside the block. the miners can sign your transaction for you.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoFb3mcxluY)
"What you are describe as bitcoin’s utility and moving coins around is covered in nr 1) Collectible 

Miners taking a cut when moving coins does not break the store of value property. They just need an incentive to put your tx in a block. "
don’t you think that the linear scale of bitcoin cash block increase will run into the same blocksize issues as bitcoin.? (my tx moved for under 2$ this weekend)
with bitcoin cash fees are optional. you can pay $0.01 to speed it up, or $0.00 to wait a block or two for a confirmation.  When fees are $10-100 per tx, yes, that breaks the store of value.  50% of BTC addresses are unspendable already.

Congrats on succesfully listing zero people who had anything to do with the code changes, planning, or launch of Bitcoin Cash.

Seriously dude, the kool-aid.  You've got to stop.

> Well turns out he is Calvin Ayre. He made it on the homeland security top ten most wanted list and another agency.

You act as if it is surprising to encounter shady people in the Bitcoin world.  Dude, I've got some news for you and you aren't going to like it.  A shitload of shady people are and have always been attracted to Bitcoin.

You should read up on the censorship that has destroyed /r/Bitcoin, and the shady dishonest ""vulnerability sharing policy"" of Core, as well as their own shady histories such as writing bots to vandalize wikipedia pages and surreptitiously adding blacklists to Bitcoin Core clients in linux repositories.

> These are the people attacking bitcoin 

Rofl, dude, the kool-aid.  Jesus, get informed.  You sound like a moron.

>  If you want to bet your money on their success, maybe think twice.

You're betting success on the people who think **NOT ALLOWING MORE USERS TO USE BITCOIN** is a good idea?

Do you even economics bro?

> Calling Bitcoin Cash the ""real"" Bitcoin is straightforward fraud

Claiming that you get to decide what is and isn't Bitcoin is fraud.

Markets decide.  Not Theymos or Core."
"> what are you talking about? You're obvously being lied to and falling for it.

Rofl.

I guarantee I know more about Bitcoin than you do.  Almost certainly been involved longer and hold more too.

> The coin you are following is a forked splt which is now a different coin.

Forks are forks.  They are not suddenly different coins because Theymos says so.

>  Forks are an alt coin, it's as simple as that.

Somebody's been drinking the kool-aid...

> so they know what to implmement in the ORIGINAL chain.

""Nothing"" is what they're implementing on the original chain.  Hence businesses and users leaving in droves because they can't even use the damn thing."
