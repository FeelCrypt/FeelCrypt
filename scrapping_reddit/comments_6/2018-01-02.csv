"Ripple isn't necessarily a currency, it's used by the banks. Dragonchain isn't necessarily a currency, it's a platform for other cryptos to be built off of. 

If I'm not mistaken, and I'm sure there's numerous other uses all across the board"
Weâ€™ve effectively done what 99.9% of internet conversations fail to do... meet in the middle! Have a good day, you mad scientist, you. ðŸ˜Ž
"> a fee market will never be efficient.

Perfectly efficient, I'm sure there is very useful ""good enough""."
"Projecting, again. 

We all know it is r/bitcoin that is censored and manipulated to confuse people. "
"> No Ripple will be created beyond what is already created.

That is a baseless claim to which there is no evidence to support. Bitcoin has a 21 million unit hard cap in the code, it is not possible for there to be greater than 21 million bitcoins and if there are, it is not Bitcoin. 

XRP has no such property. They can be created out of thin air for zero cost, that is how the existing supply of 100 billion XRP was created, of which the banks own the majority of.

Anyone trading real, decentralized, blockchain based currencies with a limited supply for the worthless XRP tokens that have no cost to create and can be issued at will, is a victim. This is highway robbery. 

Most of the people buying XRP are noobs that don't understand these facts. No real cryptocurrency/blockchain enthusiasts support XRP. (Remember, XRP has no blockchain.)

> This is not a fiat currency.

And the sky is not blue. 

With respect, get your head out of your ass.

The tokens are created out of thin air, by a centralized issuing entity. 38 billion were made available to the public but 62 billion are held on reserves by banks. 

As well, there is nothing fundamentally limiting their ability to create more. No blockchain to track issuance. No proof of work is being performed to back the transactions. There is no cost to create the tokens since it does not require proof of work. 

**They literally just change numbers on a computer.** 

And suckers are paying upwards of $2 per unit for the tokens. Go figure. 

If you can't see that is the exact same thing as fiat just disguised as a cryptocurrency then you need to do more research into the differences between the two. 

However, the information I have presented to you thus far is more than enough for you to begin to understand the difference.

It is solvable to a much higher degree than typically done, however, to do so requires a lot of external trust in the data used to do fee estimation, or alternatively require running a full node permanently. The former is anti the very core principle of cryptos and the latter is just impractical for 99.9% of wallets. 
[deleted]
I do believe that a full node, by default, will rebroadcast it's mempool transactions after a restart.
"Every single thing I said is true and you can independently verify any of it yourself. So no need to point a finger at it and scream ""wrong"" without backing your claims. 

Seems to me you are invested in XRP but you don't know the first thing about it. You don't like these truths because they go against what you probably thought when you bought into XRP. 

Well, continuing to lie to yourself will only hurt you in the long run. 

And by the way you've got to be utterly clueless if you don't know most of the XRP are held by institutions. You might as well try arguing that the state of California does not exist on a map.

"Itâ€™s as easy to say core developers could adjust the code to change the amount of bitcoin that can be mined.  Would it create a fork?  Sure but as we have seen with the whole btc/BCH schism,competing ideology can cause problems In btc land too.  

On top of that, to do so by ripple or core developers would destroy credibility with the asset.   They really have no incentive to do it. 

Also. Itâ€™s not like there are not other cryptos who have fully or partially premined coin. 

So, with respect, get your head out of your ass.  Your parroting bullet points without checking veracity of your claims. For one, Banks do not control 62 billion xrp. Well start there. 

Your a decentralized, POW crypto idealist, I get it,  but it blinds you.  Your arguing a SUV is not a car, even thought the accomplish the same task. 

The fact is my statement is still accurate. Itâ€™s faster and far cheaper to transfer money with XRP than with BTC, or BCH for that matter...

I was also right on another....  drawing out haters"
No Ripple will be created beyond what is already created.   This is not a fiat currency. There is nothing out there that says otherwise. Not sure where your getting your info from. 
When block rewards dry up, what is left, though?
Haha yes that is truly amazing! Good day to you, too ðŸ˜Ž
What makes you think it's not as secure? Besides the lack of review of course -- hasn't had as much time to be broken. Only the owner  can add anything to his block chain as he has to have the private key. The proof of work is just an anti-spam mesure.
"If centralization and currency inflation are not issues, why not use government fiat.

Bitcoin, enabled through blockchain technology, eliminated these issues. 

A currency like ripple, which has these issues, seems to be a step backward."
Can you explain why it won't be efficient? It works well with Ether by adjusting the gas cost, yet why can't the same be done with sat/B?
I just transferred you 100 XRB. How do you know if I had that to begin with or not? According to my account, I have it. Some other nodes might disagree...
I get your point. And I agree that it should be discussed. It just bothers me when itâ€™s brought up as a way to delegitimize increasing the blocksize. It feels a bit like early jet engineers being against rocket fuel for fear of the greenhouse effect. You know what I mean?

"Sacrilege, but I suggest a 0.5BCH/block tail emission.
"
Not entirely up to speed on how it works other than what is explained in the paper, but I don't understand why this would be a problem. You should at least know what your own account holds -- everything else shouldn't matter much, right?
"~2035 if the tail emission is to exceed 0.390625BCH.

AFAIK, Monero should hit their (0.6XMR) tail emission by then, so we can see how it works in practice."
What do you mean, and why is this a problem?
"1) It would be perfectly economical to move 1BTC and any other amount on chain with bigger blocks. As far as profitability goes: Even a subcent fee will be enough for miners with world adoption. With giga or terra blocks this subcent-fee adds up to a significant amount.

2) LN has the purpose to handle small value transactions. 1 BTC is not a small value transaction.

3) you would still have to broadcast your 1BTC Transmission back to the chain so you would still make an on-chain transaction as the receiving end of that money. 


"
Substantiate your claims, rather than calling factual statements lies.
"Yeah, I can see that. I should have been more specific; why does it matter -- isn't the only transaction history I really care about my own, which I can verify on my own?"
Sure, thereâ€™s just a million more pressing problems at the moment it seems to me. But a little science fiction 100 years in the future is always fun to ponder, I concur.
"Lol, that isn't how this works. You're the one making false claims. Here's there correct information.

Information on continued decentralization: https://ripple.com/insights/xrp-ledger-decentralizes-expansion-55-validator-nodes/


Information on transaction cost:
https://ripple.com/build/transaction-cost/

Information on total XRP created in protocol (read under XRP):
https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Ripple_(payment_protocol)"
I donâ€™t think itâ€™s ridiculous. You can certainly discuss it and ensure that Bitcoin (Cash) has a real long term plan. It gives the crypto more validity.
Sounds to me like it should be pinned to the average price of a kilowatt-hour, and then multiplied by bytes as usual, instead of just currency.
They may change how the units that they estimate value with the future this is true. But the equivalent value to one tenth of a penny seems like the right amount of value.
"He's trying to communicate that given the volume of transactions, the miner reward for a single transaction would be minimal.

I think it's reasonable to believe that if the technology is adopted widely, on-chain transactions will only be affordable to LN channels. Perhaps it won't be economical to move 1BTC on-chain."
It's incredibly likely we won't need it. Either way 2120 is probably the year to tackle that problem.
If I surround you with nodes that are lying, it's hard to see which version of history is correct.
"The default client behaviour is not like this however you can repeatedly do this if you wish to. The message and transaction are valid to the network. All you would have to do is a small amount of coding to log all the broadcasts and then just spam them repeatedly with a small script.

It does cause issues and has done so for a long time. I am not sure if there is a currently a way to fix this aside from replace by fee being made the default. 

The reason for the rebroadcasts could be an attack to clog the mempool, keep people trapped in btc, or a variety of reasons. I suspect its most likely a mixture of attack and altruism, by different actors in the network."
"The problem of decentralization has already been solved via blockchain. Ripple uses a different validation method.

Never commented on transaction cost.

Total XRP is still an issue for investors in XRP. Not predictable like BTC. "
Worrying about a problem in 2140 with cutting-edge technology seems patently ridiculous. Thatâ€™s like the Wright Brothers worrying about drones.
Yes i think so, it's a PoS blockchain with 5s block time.
"(You are funny but again completely missing the point.)

I'll get my beer then. I have some cold ones in the fridge. "
Well, let the party begin. 2140, here we come!
can you point me to any info supporting your claim? Cause I've not heard of this. All I've read has pointed to the contrary.
Couldn't agree more.
"Yes we do have 1000 other problems. It still is interesting to talk about it and where else if not in a subreddit about Bitcoin (Cash)? 

We have a million other problems in our daily lives but we still discuss topics like life on other stars, Faster than light travel and so much other shit that just doesn't affect us right now. But are these discussions ridiculous? I don't think so. Maybe even the Wright Brothers were talking about where aviation technologies will be a hundred years from now. 
If you don't like talking about it than don't but don't ridicule people that do.

21 Million Blocks WILL occur and we know that (EDIT: *Whence the term 'science fiction' you used is a little bit misplaced here*). If people like to talk about it - let them. Also it is a question that is asked by Mainstream media in a lot of interviews. And the answer: Let our future selfs deal with it is not always the most elegant choice when you are promoting the cash payment system of the future that is to be used by all humanity. So to a certain degree this topic **is** relevant right now."
I see. Got it. Thank you for your patient explanations. Guess I need to learn more about it.
Huh?
There's more than one way to find a solution. Transaction cost destroys XRP, which makes it inherently deflationary. Total XRP is not an issue for investors, we know how it's being distributed and how much there is. But keep on pushing that narrative like you need to.
How do you know if I have enough money in my account when I pay you? Suddenly you need to know about my account too.
Exactly we should have had proper time to figure out the best path forward by then.
Lol actually thought I was on the other sub when I posted that.
Fee estimation is an unsolveable problem though we're literally telling people to predict a market in order to be even slightly efficient and you can see that the system isn't working. That's why Bitcoin dominance has fallen under 40% when it used to be well over 90%.
The only thing that's fun is your attitude towards the topic. 
"Because in ether there's not an artificially low supply cap so it can't settle on something predictable. And they did have some wild fees the first couple adjustments as the network got used to the periodic gas limit increases.

When supply is artificially low, your action of deciding a fee and the future actions of fees need to be predicted in order to reliably choose a fee price. There's an actually game theory bit that someone went into details before too but I can't seem to find it at the moment.

TLDR, it works well with others because the supply of transaction space isn't artificially limited, that limit forces you to predict the unpredictable future to be efficient."
In the year 2140, when crypto is the default method for commerce worldwide currency a predictable sub $0.001 fee on every transaction will be plenty.
Because your node can be convinced by other nodes to accept a false history. In Bitcoin this is impossible because you can trivially verify the proof of work.
It is becoming decentralized. It is a deflationary currency. Educate yourself before you just make up lies.

"One thing I've observed to be a problem is ""ghost transactions"", transactions that are visible at some nodes but not all.

Don't make it seem like Bitcoin cash is the solution, cause it is not. There are better coins like litecoin, ripple, railblocks, Vertcoin, that are better at speed and cost than Bitcoin cash. Just don't. Bitcoin Cash has to shine on its own, not on the corpse of the dead Bitcoin 
Sent .9 btc today. 10 euro fee. It took 10 minutes to confirm. Cheaper and faster than the bank.
How does this happen? Unconfirmed transactions are returned after 2 weeks?
it's supposed to be dropped after 2 weeks in mempool, you got your service to blame for processing things for at least 1 week prior to sending...
Was it segwit?
DAELI5 is that good
I thought after 3 days failed transactions are pretty much out of the mempool and assigned back to the original wallet.

Whoa solid deal!
Entirely expected, as there is less activity over the holiday season.  Also, people stop transacting when they see how expensive and unreliable it is - the norm over the last year has been that there usually are periods with idle capacity over the weekends, where transactions with very low fee gets confirmed.  /u/jstolfi has even  predicted that there will always be periods with idle capacity as the capacity limit is actively killing demand, personally I'm not so sure as rational actors will always throw in low-fee-transactions with RBF enabled in order to consolidate their wallets and do other low-priority transactions.

"I'd say that the Bitcoin system does not handle ""full blocks"" very well.  As I see it, this was a theoretical problem before 2016-03, and for us it continues being a theoretical problem after 2017-08, but what happens if the network gets really spammed by lots of transactions with really low transaction fee?

I tend to believe the solution is a network-wise consensus on what a minimum transaction fee should be.  Currently, in the BCH ecosystem, this seems to be 1 satoshi / byte, and currently I can hardly imagine that anyone would want to afford spamming the BCH blockchain so much that legitimate transactions (defined as those paying more than 1 satoshi / byte) get stuck for weeks."
I disagree.  It's a great time to get in.  That said, don't take investment ~~advise~~  advice from random strangers on the internet.  Raiblocks, as long as it passes security checks, will be huge in 2018.

"Transactions can be repeatedly broadcast. It takes just one node to rebroadcast a transaction and and extend its life by another two weeks.

The mempool timeout should never have been increased beyond three days. In fact it ought to be even smaller, perhaps only one hour. That way a payment will fail quickly, so it can be sent again. You should not have to wait two weeks before retrying your send.

I use breadwallet on iOS and had a transaction confirm yesterday. Started on dec 8 if I remember correctly. It never returned just finally went through.
"""was it"" not ""what is""... "
Isn't the point of blockchain to eliminate those issues from the start.
nah it wasn't premined. It was fauceted out for several years.
This shouldn't be like this, it's a really easy attack vector.  Just set up a node to constantly rebroadcast all transactions and you'll keep peoples too-low fee transactions unless they CPFP.
By design, it's not as secure as PoW coins. That doesn't mean that instant free transactions don't have value.
No? Blockchain is just a software platform. Use it for whatever you want. Those aren't issues.

"Thatâ€™s grand.  Faulting me for not backing claims but donâ€™t do it yourself.   Your link really didnâ€™t prove anything.  Your also sidestepping the significant institutional and government ownership of bitcoin. 

Iâ€™m invested in multiple coins. XRP is one of them.   There is money to be made backing the decentralized plays and the corporate plays, of which Ripple is obviously ahead of the group on. 

Right now 55 billion of the xrp is out of circulation and in escrow.  So they are not held by anyone at this time.  

The coin is meant for interbank cross boarder currency transfers. Of course banks will carry a large portion of it.  I want them to.  I hope to see more than the 100 banks already signed on.

">One thing I've observed to be a problem is ""ghost transactions"", transactions that are visible at some nodes but not all. If the wallet believes the transaction is gone, it may be difficult to do RBF or CPFP. ....

Yes! I've encountered such transactions more then once when using the Electrum wallet for BTC and wanting to increase the fee on a stuck transaction. Some Electrum servers don't see the transaction, so it won't appear in the history. Configuring Electrum to use a different server will make the transaction appear again in the history, allowing it to be rebroadcast with a higher fee.

Problems like this clearly indicate that the Bitcoin Core system is badly broken.

Did you calculate the value of the BCH at the time of the transaction? Based on the the trading range on January 1st, it looks like it was valued at $56 or $57, which, on the one hand, isn't bad considering you are turning an asset into cold hard cash. But it's also about 12-14% profit for them. Again, I don't have a feel for how much profit is reasonable for providing such an exchange, but I wouldn't say there was no fee.

Ok, i will believe you. I guess someone would do that. I just didn't think there would be such a huge market of people with gift cards that want to also pay a premium for BTC. Perhaps I should try a large purchase next time. 
Yes, whoops. I mean either buying BTC by purchasing a wish list, or selling BTC by getting others to purchase your own wish list.

">You do realize this is effectively a ban, right?

Yup. They do it because they wanna catch the guy making millions and not reporting his gains, but they fail to realize they fuck over anyone who made a few bucks on their BCH and bought a t-shirt making them eligible for jailtime should they fail to report and pay 25% on that few bucks they gained."
Looks good. Thank you. Will post about it.

"someone who has amazon gift card credit, and wants Bitcoin more, and is willing to pay a 30% premium.

I've had every order fulfilled on purse, at least back when BTC was usable. "
How can you sell BTC by purchasing a wish list? Did you mean buy BTC?
"Too late. 17k klicks at imgur. :D Better be more carefully next time

This is what ACTUALLY killed Bitcoin being used as a currency in brick and mortar establishments and many online retailers.    When the US gov. declined to recognize it as a currency and instead a commodity.

True. Should have looked better :D hopefully somebody will make it for Amazon Europe soon. For now I will trade it to Steam gift Cards at Amazon. They work with europe accounts too.
"> , If i'm planning to buy something expensive, like $1,000 TV or something. It's worth it for me to use purse and set a 30%~ discount using the wishlist.

But who is going to buy that TV for you, paying a 30% premium on their BTC? Who would do that?"
"See

https://www.cryptodechange.com/

They do gift cards for Amazon UK, Sainsburys, Tesco etc

They haven't added the ability to pay in BCH yet, but you can pay in Doge, Litecoin or Feathercoin (scroll to the bottom and select currency). They used to have loads more alts (like Reddcoin), but removed them (presumably because people weren't using them)."
I think these gift Cards work worldwide. I bought it for my german account. 
Sure. Thats a temp solution like chicken and egg.
Purse.io, when they integrate BCH (should be soon) might be something to look at.

Ouch .... yeah !!
Purse.io bites the dust? I have friends who work there! 
No discount?
I just bought more 2 amazon gift cards today. I bought two yesterday and 2 more today. And the support is AWESOME!!! I recommend buy things there, it is easy, very cheap and very fast!!!
Unfortunately limited to only Amazon.com. 
hug of death?
Nice! I'll check out this site. I tried paying with BCH on Overstock and it shapeshifted everything to BTC so a $25 order had me send $50 worth of BCH. I canceled because of that shit. This I can get behind. 
don't forget to pay your capital gains taxes when you purchase something, that's the true hidden cost...
See r/buttcoin . NO Fee this time for Butters :D
Any websites doing this with amazon uk gift cards per chance?
"Can I sell on that site?

I have a bunch of Amazon GC, I want to sell for bch"

Awesome, thanks again.
Yeah I mean if enough miners got together they could pick a channel and refuse to confirm the remedy transaction.  This would result in theft, so where before miners could simply censor, now they can steal!
No. I'm saying support a few generations, don't require a 1080ti.....
This is only possible with RBF, which BCH does not have.
And you can have smaller, localized visa-like services that can cooperate, settling in cryptomoney like Bitcoin Cash, daily.
Theoretically Lightning is a great idea. No one can argue with that unless they are religious. It will probably be extremely difficult to make it work in practice at the scales being advertised, which should make any reasonable person skeptical. But that doesn't mean it won't work. We just don't know that yet. And people saying they know just show that they are afraid that it might succeed. Which they should, at least if they sold of all their BTC for BCH, since a fully working Lightning would probably make BCH next to worthless. 
[deleted]
"I don't, because I have no idea whether or not Roger has investments/controlling interests in any mining companies. I also don't foresee a future for BCH in it's current form where Roger Ver doesn't get every change he wants because he is so responsible for a lot of the big, important infrastructure supporting Bitcoin Cash. The guy blatantly insider trades while claiming it's a good thing, and calls BCH his ""project"". So yes, I still believe Roger Ver is the leader (behind the scenes) of BCH."

Rbf defaults to false in his code. It's not required. The code works by making the original paying transaction undesirable to miners and making a conflicting transaction that they're more likely to pick up. RBF is not required."
"How,  exactly,  does Roger get *his* changes in code?  Please give an example with names,  dates,  git references etc.

I get that u may feel envious of his wealth and freedom to follow his libertarian ideas. But don't mistake that for control of Bitcoin Cash which has multiple dev teams unlike Core which is centralised and funded by one company. "
Yes but why would BCH need LN right now?
"I was referring to the Core / Blockstream team. Not sure if a list was ever put together, but it looks like RV want to put one together.

">The code works by making the original paying transaction undesirable to miners and making a conflicting transaction that they're more likely to pick up.

This is not possible on BCH, the nodes would not accept it and not include it in their mempool if the original tx is in it."
Don't have the time. Do your own research if you're truly interested. Or you can just keep drinking the kool-aid, whatever you prefer.
No Core will never raise blocksize, and we dont want Core to raise it now. They need to stay crippled LN highfeecoin.  They segshitted their bed now they must sleep in it.
"Both bitcoin and bitcoin cash have conflicting transactions all the time. The nodes don't reject them. They accept both and the miners pick whichever pays more. 

Even if your assertion were true the double spend would still be possible. All you need to do is get your original transaction sent directly to the node you're paying and send your second transaction paying yourself directly to the miners. 
The concept of 0-conf transactions is inherently flawed. Confirmations are what gives bitcoin security. You can't expect security if you cut out the innovation that provides it."
">The market will choose BCH if they want bigger blocksize.

Yeah, but the market does not want bigger blocksize, therefore the market has not chosen BCH.

> They won't bother begging BlockStream/Bilderberg Core for it. 

When market starts rewarding blocksize increase, BlockStream will adapt to market requirements. Right now market is not rewarding it, so they don't have to spend energy on it.

As for second claim, I'm not sure it is true, I will ask /r/lightningnetwork sub about it"
Do you feel embarassed for not being able to understand code and still defend it?
Because it isn't a permanent solution. Even 10folding Blocksize won't give BTC enough speed to transfer for the entire world. It's a limited scalability option that comes at the cost of more centralisation. In the end you'll only have massive datacentres as nodes because no-one else will be able to have an internet connection fast enough.
"> Both bitcoin and bitcoin cash have conflicting transactions all the time. The nodes don't reject them. They accept both and the miners pick whichever pays more.

No, without RBF nodes only accept 1 tx with input x and y. If you would send another tx using input x and y it would get rejected by the node. So unless you are extremely fast (2 seconds) in getting your double-spend tx included in the node's mempool it wouldn't work. 0-Conf is not flawed, but the whole double spend etc stuff is just not worth it for the amount of money vendors would accept with 0-conf. Would you do all this shit just to double spend 1$ you just bought a coffee with? "
Gold collapsing, bitcoin up! Legendary bitcointalk thread, now continued on bitco.in
"I wouldn't do any of this. I'm not a criminal. I can tell you with certainty though that people will absolutely do it for any amount of money. 

Can you point to the code on github where they changed the conflicting transaction behavior? BCH is a fork of bitcoin and as of yet I've heard no news on changing this behavior. And again, in any event, this does not protect against 0-conf double spends. It makes it marginally more difficult, but is in no way an assurance for merchants.

Additionally the function CWallet::MarkConflicted indicates that it does not drop or reject transactions, but rather marks them as conflicted. https://github.com/Bitcoin-ABC/bitcoin-abc/blob/6c9c42ccb093820d5dd6f32f02c657c25ce5f823/src/wallet/wallet.cpp

Additionally the rpcwallet code has functionality for listing conflicts, which it couldn't do if they were all rejected:

Might wanna talk to your leader Roger Ver.
[deleted]
That is accurate, however last I heard Flexible Transactions weren't even as close to release as lightning.
"If Alice has a channel with Bob, and he is paying Charlie a nominal fee to monitor his channel while he's offline, what's stopping Alice from paying Charlie even more to withhold a punishment transaction and assist with fraud?

Nothing at all. Alice can bribe Charlie to look the other way, and Charlie has a profit incentive to do it. Bob's third-party monitor is only as secure as the amount he pays for it."
"> That's why they don't bother using SegWit (they haven't even heard of it)

Should've been a mandatory tx format change (what's the point of keeping an inferior format around?), hard forked in with wide ecosystem consensus (probably bundled with a max block size increase) and a decent period between lock-in and enforcement (6 months?)."
"> When using exchanges my buy/sell orders are obviously off-chain. But deposits and withdrawals are not. Day traders and people running arbitrage between exchanges pull money in and out of the exchanges multiple times a day. So that whole quite substantial chunk of the transaction load could be reduced with just a very minimal adoption of a relatively basic LN

LN only works for small payments, most traders that are pulling money to an from the exchange will be moving large amounts of funds in the order of a few bitcoin ( or you would be better leaving those coins on the exchange ). If an exchange wanted to facilitate large LN network transactions they would need to fund a channel with most of their cold storage bitcoin. This would present additional security risks, you are trusting no malware will have access to your hot lighting network node.

Alot exchange transactions are also one directional eg fiat in bitcoin out or the other way around. Lightning network will never work for these transactions. 

If i was moving 10 BTC, i from an exchange I am happy to pay high bitcoin fees for fast onchain transactions wouldn't care about 20-50 dollar fee's. I wouldn't be happy locking up 20 BTC in a channel so I can send this. Also i believe the maximum LN transaction  is 0.1 BTC

LN basically is for multiple small transactions, otherwise you would have to keep funding your channel for every transaction you would be better off using basic bitcoin transactions 

Typical use case is, you open a channel for 0.5 btc then use this channel to pay for games, VPN subscription and what ever small purchases you make in a year.  Sadly block stream has eliminated 100% of theses use cases, they wont magically appear again once its economically viable. Hope their dumb ass gamble works of because I still hold some bitcoin, but mostly bitcoin cash. "
"0 conf is way to easy to game, as Peter Todd proved when he double spent to buy reddit gold back before the mempool was congested.

About halfway through the Carvalho interview (24:40 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJT2CbfHTpo&t)
">Small blocks are centralizing Bitcoin mining in China by making mining only a function of electricity, rather than electricity and network connectivity. 

Are you high as bricks or what? Fast network connectivity is easy for them. For the layman it's something hard to come across. You're taking the exact arguments FOR lower blocksize, and somehow saying that they are arguments against it. "
[deleted]
How would that work? You tip someone 50c and they pay $30 to open a channel to retrieve it?
Thank you
Great read and one I missed, but he seems to be decidedly neutral on the issue, perhaps veering towards small blocks due to the increased orphan rates. Or did I miss something?
https://imgur.com/a/BBdlu
"Yeah neutral in that particular piece although I read it as leaning ""big block"" possibly due to my biases. /u/Xtreme_Fapping_EE has posted a much less ambiguous link below."
But this cannot be explained by incompetence. It is too absurd.
I didn't say that. I said Roger Ver thinks unlimited blocksize is acceptable. He then went on to say that miners would not accept an infinitely large block, and then said miners will determine how big the blocks get and what transactions to include. Sounds like a fee market to me.
0 Conf, which f.e. BitPay accepted when BTC mempool wasn't overflowing like milk on a stove.
"Well said

The root of the scaling challenge is that on blockchain, every mining node need to participate in the verification of each TX, thus TXs need to propagate to all of them, which in turn increase the bandwidth and processing requirement, depends on how many nodes each node connects to 



LN is trying to make TX data between A and B only propagate between themselves, thus rest of the nodes do not need to know about their TX, and saving bandwidth



As a result, TXs that are not sent to the rest of the network can not be verified by major hash power, thus become insecure. So LN decided to take the deposit (channel opening) TX and sent it to the network and secured by blockchain, but let the subsequent spending TX rely on P2P communications. And if some of the spending TX went wrong, you either refund the full deposit by sending a punishing TX or accept the loss because the fee is too high to send such a punishing TX



So it is compromising the in-channel transaction security in exchange for less TXs broadcasted on chain. But is this compromising really worth it? Why don't simply increase the bandwidth and hardware capacity of mining nodes and still maintain full security with all on-chain transactions? That seems to be a much more robust one-approach-to-rule-them-all solution"
Isn't this a good thing? Means core will be forced to do block size increase. You will finally get what you wanted guys.
"K,  fine.  Then you withdraw the statement about Roger being the ""leader"" of Bitcoin Cash also? That was my point. 

The ""fee market"" you mention has always existed in Bitcoin,  since miners are the ones with money invested and they get to decide what transactions should be added to a block. "
Thanks!
When Alice steals Bob's coins, and soon after  moves the coins out of lightning enabled address, Bob is screwed even if he broadcast a cryptographic proof subsequently to recover the funds, right?
"Please provide the quote. 

In any case this sub and Bitcoin Cash in general practices freedom of thought and expression,  this may be a little new and strange for you... "
The market does want bigger blocks, thats why Bitcoin Cash exists and is being adopted by most major economic nodes like BitPay.
"Let me rephrase that. Will correct the paragraph above.

When a transaction happens on LN, it is not confirmed by the Blockchain. It is first confirmed by the LN, and then the channel where the transaction happened will need to be closed before the sum of the aggregate of transactions can be confirmed on the Blockchain. So before the value of a LN transaction can be confirmed on the Blockchain, miners will still need to confirm it.

TLDR:

Transactions confirmed by the LN but not by miners are not confirmed in the Blockchain. Doing this is fine, but users should be aware that there can be all sorts of ""funny"" accounting happening on their channel that may or may not destroy the value of their side because it has NOT yet been confirmed into the Blockchain. (See Banks to Big to Fail https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/too-big-to-fail.asp). "
I think we forget that lightning does more than just lighten the load on the blockchain. It also enables instant transactions. If we want bitcoin to be adopted by regular people to be used in local shops, they aren't going to wait 10-20 minutes for a confirmation. 
"The market will choose BCH if they want bigger blocksize.  They won't bother begging BlockStream/Bilderberg Core for it.  They have already proven they won't even do a measly 2MB increase and will risk a split and collapse of the entire network.  Bitcoin Core will never raise blocksize without a nasty split, and why split again? We already have the big block split, its BCH.

[Forkius Maximus also breaks this down](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7ndkvm/elizabeth_stark_of_lightning_labs_admits_that_a/ds134be/):

> Perhaps more to the point, LN wouldn't work (even in principle) with full blocks. Yet Core is deadset on full blocks. That means LN cannot be a solution for any Core supporter.

> Anyone who thinks BTC can solve its massive fee problems without forking away from Core is dreaming, and anyone who wakes up from this dream will realize the fork away from Core has already happened: it's called Bitcoin Cash.
