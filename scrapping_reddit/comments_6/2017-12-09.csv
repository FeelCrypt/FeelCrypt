I'm considering some real estate. what other diversification would you suggest aside from anything associated with fiat currency?
It will keep rising now matter what. 
Donâ€™t directly take financial advise from a dude on reddit. But do carefully look into stocks or bonds. You can make a solid 8% a year on long term investments. That may not seem flashy, but after 10-20 years it will be a huge sum of cash. Like doubling your initial investment in 10 years
