I appreciate the response, and more generally, your great leadership.
Hey, Brian, can you guys sign a  letter saying that you will list BTU (BiTcoin Unlimited) and BTC (BiTcoin northCorea) on your exchange after the hard fork happens? This way, we can begin removing BTC and ensuring Bitcoin is referred to as BT from now.
">I assume it would get banned.

https://archive.is/5Nry7"
looks like it got put back. I see it on the front page now.
seems it was removed due to linking here without np.reddit, or maybe it was due to the above link which has www. instead of np. /
It got removed.  Basically /r/bitcoin is owned by Core.

We all know you're a fraud. Its good that downvotes give you more exposure so more people can see the fraud you are. 
Agreed, Dash is excellent.

Yeah I'd like to know too.
What is fraudulent about those statements?
If those 10% really insist, they would have block times of 100 minutes and the retarget will take 20 weeks. Since no one can finance that and since any replay attack issue will only be on their side, BlockstreamCore has to create a hard fork with replay prevention for their alt-coin anyway. The only reason they want us to care already about replay attacks is to premature support their future alt-coin.
"I don't think this would be a good use of time. I spent a bunch of energy on this in 2015 and it didn't seem to be effective. Back channel phone calls, and building relationships with key players seem to be working best.

"As always, the devil's in the details- namely the percentages.  

If BU happens and the minority side continues to have 5-10%, they're done and everybody is best served by simply sticking a fork in them.  

If BU happens and the minority side continues to have 20-25%, they have a slow and crippled but potentially viable chain.  
I'd hope that for the good of everybody they'd shut down and adopt BU (so we don't have two chains going forward) but these days people talk about crazy stuff like UASF and PoW changes as if they're great ideas so who the hell knows.  "
If you sell a future of something, you have to be able to deliver. How does that work with fork futures while a fork is not certain?
"Very good and understood. 

Thank you very much for replying and for maintaining a patient professionalism. "
I'm pretty sure it was Phil Potter. It's just an impression of mine but I somehow think he's bought by blockstream. (I know I'm just wildly speculating here but that's my feeling)
Not necessary. It's all there.
">Are you serious? Core has nothing to do with /r/Bitcoin - its a place for redditors to talk about bitcoin. thats it. have you ever thought about that?.
Miners should have listened to Core. The current situation is worse than just having SegWit enabled.

>Jihan and Roger and large portions of people in this sub in particular are disturbing the peace because they cannot get others to do what they want. They are a bunch of turd muffins.

.


>Roger Ver and Jihan Wu should have recieved this warning a year ago. I think they are victims of astroturfing and manipulation and is now carrying out the instigators bidding without even knowing it. Very sad.

>You dont get it. There are no nations in bitcoin, but the act of aggresion from Jihan etc. is similar to any other act of aggression. And you are trying to blame the victim. It makes you a scumbag.

.


>Imo they are welcome to fork to a different chain. If 99% of hashrate leaves to something else, thats just sad. I will move on. But if the split is more like 75% / 25% and the real chain has a chance to live on, but the 75% or portion of it, start attacking it, thats when a pow change would have to happen i think.

.

>calm down dude. you can divert your anger and frustration at the people like Jihan and Roger Ver. But the sad part is i think they are good guys. They are just victims of the astroturfing and manipulation going on.

.

>I think it would be good to have a PoW change ready, but i dont think it should be used preemtively. Let a miner attack first, see how bad it gets, and then deploy the PoW change if absolutely necceseray.
.

>it is unrealstic for BU to provide lower fees, because bitcoin is in exponential growth. Raise the blocksize to 8mb, you get 24tps. Its nothing. It will be maxed out in no time. second layers is the name of the game.

.

>Dont change PoW preemtively, let Jihan and his hashers do their worst. When we see how bad it is, maybe a PoW change is in order. Thats my 50 cents.
The takeaway about the blocksize debate and BTU is that its all talk. We should be laughing at their attempts to replace bitcoin

Your post history. 
"Samsung was named as one ""trustworthy"" individual. It is very likely that more people were involved.  "
Good point - ok thx
"I agree. 

But don't forget, talk is cheap. Eventually everyone will end up on a Bitcoin chain with slightly larger blocks, because not even Blockstream with all their bank money can finance this huge loss that miners would have.

Personally I would prefer for BlockstreamCore to have their own coin to mess with. Bitcoin could be blossom again."
And Bitcoin Core is practically controlled by Blockstream. 
He was cross posting without using 'np'.
Ty.
"One of the biggest Bitcoin companies merely tries to clarify their stance after their position is distorted, and it is banned. The mods really simply want to have Core's back, at all costs, even if it means distorting the truth as much as their moderation can possibly allow. This is one to save and show anyone in the future who doubts the depth and egregiousness of the censorship.

Edit: Now it is back up. False alarm. They say it was caught by the automodder because it wasn't an NP link. Or maybe they caved to the pressure?
"
I thought the main goal of trading the fork futures is to show demand for the fork to encourage miners to fork. If the fork future only become available after the fork becomes inevitable, it loses a lot of the appeal for me.
What makes you think im a fraud?

Would you at least say if it was someone who currently represents one of the exchanges?
You should update your post, because Poloniex published a press release shortly after ( https://poloniex.com/press-releases/2017.03.17-Hard-Fork/ ) with even more strict position.
i would try to get a statement from Bitfury/BTCC and Petrov as to whether they are going to support a minority hashrate (25%) corechain if and when BU activates at 75% total network hashrate.  i highly doubt he would do that.  but the presumption here in the exchange letter is that he/they will fight it out when that is likely not the case.
Thank you!
One person initiated it is my understanding, but I don't want to out them (and I only have partial information). They can step forward if they want.
Beta or VHS wots it gonna be gaise?
"> I'd rather see private communication happen to move the industry forward (preferably on the phone, or in person - written communication is too easy to misinterpret people's tone). 

Or, you know, maybe have your policy posted publicly on your site.

I don't know how many times before the Ethereum hard fork that Coinbase (GDAX) was asked by customers what would happen to their balances if that planned contentious hard fork ended up with two chains sa the result.  ""We support the greatest work chain"" just wasn't going to cut it.  Of  course, Coinbase eventually was forced to cough up the $ETC (minority chain coin) it had originally withheld from its customers.  

A published policy stating the exchange's position clearly, well in advance of the fork (giving customers time to withdraw their funds if they disagree with the policy), lets customers know what to expect."
When do you think that Gdax will expand their operations to Europe? I live in Sweden but Gdax is unavailable in Sweden so I can't become your customer.
Agreed.  Unusually focused and non-hostile posts like this make me glad I'm a Coinbase customer :)
Feels good to have a coinbase account right now.
As a coinbase customer, I appreciate you taking the time to let us know your position. Thank you!
Great response! Thank you Brian.
You are one smart guy. Well done and thank you.
Now that's leadership. 
The exchanges could solve this today by just declaring the most hashrate = Bitcoin as Satoshi described.  It would instantly settle it.  Greg and Luke would quit, the least zealous developers from Core would join BU and we would all move on.
Thanks for the clarification, and for taking a considered and logical position. Did you post this to rbitcoin? I can't seem to see it over there....
Thanks for not being a blockstream core slave. Coinbase will be the top exchange in the future.
"Try to post this on /r/bitcoin and you get banned. 

Challenge to anyone with a reddit account.

Or try a similar post, or just mention something neutral about Bitcoin Unlimited. You will get banned.

Thank you for all you do, Brian.
Please issue a blog post too. Listen to the Bitcoin community (youve done this in the past, thank u)!
Who was the person who started the process of getting exchanges to sign this document? 
"Well stated. Thank you for clarifying. 
Can you tell us who initiated the letter? 
Was your signature requested? "
"This is very nicely put.  

Speaking for myself- I'd agree that whatever flavor of BTC has overwhelming hashpower majority should be called BTC.  If there is a minority chain that persists for any length of time, it should be called, well, something else.  

I think the ideal end goal would be that there is NOT a minority chain which persists for any significant length of time.  In theory, this is possible to do.  
SegWit in its current form may cause problems but a chain split probably isn't one of them.  
And as for BU- if it gets 75% miner support the rest might come around and upgrade before the first >1MB block, if that happens no minority chain would be created.  Or if a very small percentage of miners refuse to upgrade (say 10% or less) then that minority chain would be so slow until the next difficulty period that it would be essentially useless and probably safe to ignore- at 10% of hash power that's 100 minutes per 1MB block...

That said, if a significant (>10-15%) of hash power insists on maintaining a non-BU chain, work must be done to separate the two and prevent replay attacks as quickly as possible.  I think Coinbase is taking the right position here and I'm glad to be a customer of yours :)"
"In the future, what would be best is that each company issue a formal press release.

That said, thank you for your support Brian! Your advice is golden :)"
"One of the challenges has been getting all of the members of the Bitcoin ecosystem together to help make decisions on the way forward. Superficially, a lot of effort has been made doing exactly this, except that the organizers of those conferences tended to keep excluding the people who wanted larger blocks, so a false sense of consensus ""emerged.""

If Coinbase helped organize a conference, for example, that could be enormously beneficial in mitigating the damage that censorship and exclusion has caused."
"Was this by any chance also posted in r/Bitcoin ?

I can't see it anywhere..."
"Brian, your post is cute and everything but your action do not follow what you just said.

How can your company be neutral in the debate when your director of engineering is the furthest thing from neutral and one of the most vocal proponent of segwit to the point of being trollish and literally spit on any on-chain scaling attempt. He wasnt even present at the BU presentation. 

He obviously dont carry your value of neutrality and I dont think we can expect your company to be neutral on an engineering/technical stand point."
"> If there is overwhelming support from miners and users around **any new version** of the software **(regardless of who wrote it)**, then I think that will be called Bitcoin (or BTC).

">it was actually a thinly veiled attempt to keep the BTC moniker pegged to core software

TRUTH"

"Brian I think you should organize this, organize a meeting with the exchanges FFAAAARRRR away from Adam or any Blockstream or Core representative and hash this shit out.  No recordings, no spys, no documents, just a unified front.  What just transpired with a modified document is exactly what you described would happen.

The exchange risk goes both ways.  If the exchanges misrepresent BTC-c as BTC and ultimately BTC-u becomes BTC, you are exposed to misrepresentation.  The ONLY answer I can see is to list BTC-c and BTC-u.  That is purposefully neutral and each exchange could explain the difference with a notice and let things happen.  Only after things are settled down and clear would you redesignate appropriately.

"
"If anyone should add Replay protection it is segwit - I don't see that replay protection should be needed, I see it as a feature not a bug that the same transactions can propagate on ""both"" networks, in reallity, it is only one network since the miniority fork will die anyway, and if it does not it should be of economically insignificant."
I'm happy there is still some sane person in this space. Let this remind us why we as early adopters got into Bitcoin in the first place. 
"Thanks for your rather sane thinking. Unfortunately your hands are tied and you cannot give any serious objection to BlockstreamCore - they can ruin your business.

The whole naming problem is caused by Core's twist of reality when they lost the miner support.

The exchanges' decision should be simple: BTC is the longest chain at the time of fork. 

BTW, you should add DASH and enable PrivateSend, but you don't have balls for the latter part."
Please add dash to GDAX. Thanks for all the work you and your team do. You rock, and your service is great. 
">My goal is to have Coinbase be neutral in this debate.

Hahaha Bob... You're so full of crapola. Here's a couple of quotes from you:

And from Charlie Lee

[..I can't imagine how we'd support {a non-Segwit} chain](https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/839676935768715264)

And those are just a few I could find in 5 minutes. I've read lots more that show you're not so ""*neutral* in this debate""

You probably didn't notice, but you've lost my business. I'm sure there are others. Sorry, I've moved to Gemini. At least if they *said* they were neutral, it's something I could believe. Now, don't get me wrong. You own the company, and it's your right to state whatever position you want. But please, don't piss on my leg and tell me it's raining

edit:formatting"
"> I think SegWit, BU or other solutions could all be made to work


Brian, you seem to think you are  like a teacher commenting on two student projects, you are  trying to encourage the students and be fair to both groups, otherwise their feelings may be hurt.

However, this is not about being fair between sides, this is a multi billion dollar live network. It is at least possible, in theory, for a group to present a fundemtally broken idea.  Do you at least accept there is such a thing as a bad idea?  When such an idea is presented, we have a duty should be frank and point that out, in order to protect the system. 

 "
"Thank you for your statement. Just curious from your position on the ""inside"" so to speak, do you have any hope that this years-long conflict will be resolved soon? 

It's very frustrating to see so many miners sitting on the sideline, unwilling to cast support for either scaling solution. It certainly feels like this thing is coming to a climax, but I could easily see us sitting here a year from now with the same problem, but an even smaller market cap."
">A number of exchanges (GDAX, Poloniex, Gemini) didn't sign the letter

Poloniex published [their position](https://poloniex.com/press-releases/2017.03.17-Hard-Fork/) on their own website. Specifically stating 'We will support Bitcoin Core continuously as BTC'."
"Given the current circumstances the letter was neccesary. Bitcoin Unlimited is too unproffesional yet its continuing to gain hashpower. Its too spontaneus and this was a message from exchanges to the miners and bitcoin unlimited to take things more seriously and respect the stability of the ecosystem. I dont expect them to do that tho, its not in their vocabulary.

You also have to understand that people like Peter Rizun will only try to appease you. So when you ask for replay protection, they will say ""oh yes, good idea, we will look into that"" but they will never add it. You have to understand the primary drive behind Bitcoin Unlimited is power. They are not the kind of people who respect others. They just want power over them and will say and do anything to get it. So basically Coinbase is just a pawn to bitcoin unlimited, as is the common user in rbtc, Jihan Wu, Roger Ver etc. That is all.

*ninja edit* Regarding the people who are downvoting me. Please understand you are only giving me exposure. Everyone reads the bottom comments on this subreddit because good comments tend to get buried. So thanks. Have a nice day."
