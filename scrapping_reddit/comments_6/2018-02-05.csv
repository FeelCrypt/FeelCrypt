"Well, I don't exactly care what you wake up to, wake up to your own ugly mug if you like. Timezones are a bitch anyway, so I couldn't care less, at least for you. (Pickles taste good, by the way - another trade item which goes from Asian countries to Western countries - they are an example of global trade, people love them and you can do exactly nothing about it) 

Strengthening Japan's economy? Yeah, I think you forgot about the car they made and gave you. Not their fault if they can make good vehicles and sell it to you for cheaper than what your indigenous carmakers can. One of the many demerits of your capitalism thingy is greed, maybe rectify that first before posturing other people to buy home brew stuff?
Coming to rocks, what about diamonds? Surely you can't find enough of those in good ol' America. Gotta export that as well.

TL; DR you can't do shit about global trade, without it, you probably wouldn't have a phone/computer to type this harebrained and primitive bullshit on.

3. The average consumer doesn't care about minute differences in performance when vehicles by non Yankee manufacturers are significantly cheaper.

4. If you thought this was about winning or losing a debate (assuming this was one), then you're so immature it'd take years to get you up to speed on what a mature discussion among two adults actually is. If there is a bright side to this notion of yours that the discussion is over, it's that I don't have to hold your hand through elementary shit and endure your harebrained ideas.

Stargaze at your country? Blegh, not at all. *Maybe* under one of the better presidents (and only at specific acts - like the Moon landing), but this one? Not a snowflake's chance in a burning furnace."

Im not arguin economics with you. Kick rocks bromigo
Well, what about all the goods and services your country receives in return? Surely, you aren't 100% self sufficient. Unless the purpose of a monetary system (and the development of forex) was to stagnate wealth within countries, I don't see your point. External trade has been the lifeblood of most civilisations.

And global money flow is a bad thing, how exactly?
What's wrong with organic?
No. Not at all
No. Actully its me waking up to your comment and having a lot more important priorities than arguing with some pickle smoocher about why large dollar purchases are better kept within the country knstead of throwing 20k at a toyota and strengthening japans economy instead of our own. The entire reason american auto makers had to be bailed out was because dumb ass americans buying toyata or nissans instead of good old american. What exactly are these goods and serviceswe recieve from other countries that you think are so detrimental to the united states? Btw the best economic time in america was in the 50s. When unions were strong and America was buying American made shit. Like i said kick rocks fag.
Probably America cause you sure sounds like one of those whiney social justice warrior types on the left coast. You know. The reddit activists type.

All adverts for everything, and all politics, designed to appeal to the general public are all designed for idiots, because people are idiots. That's just the way it is. That's why were in such a fucking mess. Humans are stupid. They buy dumb shit and waste our resources. The lottery is just one example. 
It has nothing to do with consensus. Governments will try and track down the transactions and make you cough up your taxes, otherwise they lock you up in a cage.
In 2010.
I've seen a lot of lottery ticket addicts desperately trying to scale it by scratching off twenty tickets at once. :(
"Here's the Wikipedia page for [Economic Bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_bubble) and a quote from the first line:
>An [economic bubble] is trade in an asset at a price or price range that strongly exceeds the asset's intrinsic value.

40 minute lineups are not a sign of trading an asset at a price strongly exceeding its value. Everyone is still getting the same price for the ticket. The chances reduce in a way that the chance multiplied by jackpot is a small amount less than the price; thus, the government profits on man's inherent desire to risk. The demand is much higher when the jackpot is higher - mainly because everyone thinks that the jackpot * chance is now higher than price (sometimes it is). But in no way are tickets (legally) sold at different prices. Thus, not a bubble."
"> ...that is favourable to them...

And that is why there will always be a counter-culture that adopts something else."
"Yep. In my state gambling is illegal. But it's OK if the government runs it, somehow.

Personally, I think people should be able to do what they want with their money but the hypocrisy rankles."
"This is just a joke of a concept, government will always be needed and the services they provided will always be wanted. It is the only way for a functioning society to exist. You can never have a civilization similar to ours without the gov system we have today and the centralization that exists.

Cryptos are great idea and have some great tech behind it, but the tech is not necessarily tied to crypto and can be used for different purposes, not only crypto. The cryptocurrency idea is still new and needs alot of work but the final product will likely be alot different than what we assume at the moment. And honestly I expect a government backed one will win out in the end. "
"Even people with *very* poor understanding of probability generally get the core concept.  The odds that they'll win aren't good, but they aren't zero either and they might get lucky.

Absolutely nobody would think of $1000 worth of post-dated lottery tickets as a ""store of value.""  They don't use lottery tickets as currency.  They understand that they just represent an opportunity to get lucky (possibly with divine intervention involved)."
LocalBitcoins to the rescue

So when you buy you can deduce from your tax?

Isn't the Petro just the venzuelan coin, that has not much hope and was created as a way to bypass US sanctions? 
The lottery system only need create a token, people could constantly buy into the lottery and tokens would be burned after every drawing, block chain has the ability to change everything people are so caught up with FUD, AND there's so much research to sift through its had to see the diamonds amongst the mud
"They won't be able to. Unless they forcefully imposed their will on a centralized blockchain(my bad I meant glorified sql database silly me ripple doesn't have a blockchain) like ripple. Decentralized currencies require consensus. Good luck convincing people in 30 different countries that when coins are transferred ontop of the tx fee we should give 5% to Uncle Sam... It'll never make it past consensus because the miners vote by updating their nodes or not and all blocks will be rejected. It's the whole reason the only nodes that matter and can confirm transactions are nodes with hashpower behind them. This is to prevent someone from running a fuck ton of nodes and changing the consensus rules. They make sure you have skin in the game to vote on consensus.

Edit: on a phone cleaned up some Grammer and clarified more"
They have $30 scratch off tickets. Some people buy many. Your overall point stands though, as even that isn't at the level we are talking about.
$1 per draw maybe
You can buy more than one lottery ticket...but yes, I guess it doesn't scale as easily. 
When a Jackpot reaches a unusually high value and 40 minute lineups form at each and every lotto ticket machine... how is that not a bubble ?
"I have a feeling you'd need a foreign bank account and then somehow manage to forex convert everything, and then you'd still have a lot of unexplained money in your bank account coming from a foreign account...

Ya, I think that's prime targeting for audits."
It's quite easy and cheap to rent a virtual address in an office building, in places like Hong Kong. Then use that address to get a foreign bank account in USD. 
"> government will always be needed and the services they provided will always be wanted.

Governance will always be needed; governments--not so much. You've got to learn the difference.

We may need things like law, police, and courts--governance. We probably do not need things like an elite group of politicians who force us to do what they want and monopolize all political power.

Those two things are separable."
Government IS a service, a construct of society, much like banks are a construct of an economy. Both employ too many people, who in many if not most cases can be replaced by less expensive technology. Unfortunately, until we agree to a much simpler structure on top of a common and widespread basis, governments will remain undisrupted. 
no i called the petro a shitcoin
"You really are ignoring a whole bunch of stuff they do. Remember the government is just a bigger form of the Mafia, or any criminal organization, and mafias run their communities similar to how a government runs theirs. Protection money, support for their people and favours for each other. Your ability to go to work, to somewhat feel safe, the ability for you to is your computer to type this out is all due to government inolvement, funding etc. The concept of GPS is a government invention, and if it was not for Bill Clinton we still would not have access to such technology for public use.

Their shitcoin can if they know how to sell it do really well. Saying something is a shitcoin reeks of arrogance, and that is something I will never hold on to in this new market, where the industry leader has not been decided. Ripple for example could coopted by the government instead. Also looking ERC20 up, it does not seem to be some new government introduced coin but an update to the Ethereum network, similar to Lightning to Bitcoin. So not sure where you are calling it a shit coin. So unless you are calling Ethereum a shit coin I do not know what you are talking about.

The industry is still new and many traditional coins are likely to go the way of the Myspace before we find the Facebook for crypto."
A government is currently actually trying to put out a coin and it's just an ERC20 shittoken lulz. Governments are a PR trick. They run society in the same way that pop stars run music, that is, not at all.
"

 Listen I have never ever been involved in the buying or selling of crypto but been hoping to see how the tech improves. Its rise and fall is not always due to government talk but also due to it's inability to function as a currency at the moment. For now these currencies are get rich quick scheme's, not actually currencies. Bitcoin Cash does seem to try to fix it with their own little fix but that does not help much.

Bit coin was never illegal, it was legal, but it's usage in the black market was in a grey area. Your blind love for a currency that has not truly seen it's final potential is absurd. The tech has not matured and we are still in infancy. If cryptos do not fix their issues soon, an alt-coin one likely forwarded by the government and trust me many government have been looking into it will succeed. 

And the point of true democracy, show me where in history it has worked. Never, it never worked it. It always has been a top down system, whether it be representative democracy, council of elders, or city states with their own version of democracy that is no where near true democracy."
Did not know about this, looks like it has hope, but this would require government overhaul, which no one wants to do, and if you even suggest it will be crucified not only by the politicians but also the public.
"**Delegative democracy**

Delegative democracy, also known as liquid democracy, is a form of democratic control whereby an electorate vests voting power in delegates rather than in representatives. The term is a generic description of either already-existing or proposed popular-control apparatuses.

"> True democracy does not work

So you're why crypto dips every time a government somewhere vaguely gesticulates at banning it, lol! Why are you here at all then? Why not go buy the Petro? Hey, do you remember that law every country passed in 2008 legalizing any random person forming private unregistered banks in their own home? No? That's because there was no such law and cryptocurrency is and always has been riotously illegal. If you would leave if it was banned, then you should leave right now, because it was never allowed. Bye! Enjoy serving your masters! Tell them hi for us, tell them it won't be long now! :)"
"[Liquid democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegative_democracy) is what you're looking for.  Allows the best features of representative democracy (I don't know/care about this so someone else I nominate can represent me), direct democracy (I know/care so much about this I'll vote directly), and everything in-between.  

* Backwards compatible with the current system - pick a 'default' representative just like you do now every few years.  But change your default whenever you like - that kind of accountability can only drive representatives to represent the voter before their monied lobbyists.  
* Fully granular - nominate your representative on a per-issue basis ensures your viewpoint is always accurately represented.  
* Truly representative decisions - delegates vote carrying the weight of their accumulated votes.  
* Public key cryptography to ensure privacy/anonymity.
* On a blockchain ensures transparency.

Democracy today hasn't progressed much since a time the fastest information travelled was by horse.  Modern technology has replaced pyramids of corporate power with flatter more collaborative structures.  Time for politics to do the same."

"A centralized system areany forms not just North Korea, but whatever system we create always lead to that until we hit a post scarcity world.

Every system we have had has a top down approach from the Senate in Rome to the feudal system of England, including the parliamentary system.

The problem is people usually wants some form of stability and confidence. Plus peace is an important factor in this case. The ability to rely on certain expectations sees that a nation actually has investment and growth, but the moment instability occurs people worry and start locking up their wealth. Trying to enforce peace is hard and usually requires force in a sense, not physical force but just the concept of if you create chaos or disrupt the society you will be punished.

Second issue is how to write laws and deal with foreign and domestic affairs, you need someone who is capable in those jobs, this would likely lead to alot of experts being hired to help manage them. Now who decides who is an expert on this topic. And once decided the expert now has control over a part of the country.

But the biggest issue of all is people worship leaders, leaders they see as infallible and pure. Even if they preach individualism the very person will still follow most of.the time lock and step with their leaders. The most obvious example is Trump and his followers who follow his every move no matter how much it changes from the initial policy or statement. No matter if it is bad or good. If dear leader said it, it is good. Same in Korea and elsewhere. Not only this those who do dissent are looking for someone to rally behind at all times to fight against their oppressors. People for some reason want someone with confidence and belief to follow.

"An elite group or a system is currently needed, the current system is based on us selecting representatives for our community to sit in a government. The problem is how it is organized and the checks and balances behind it.

What is another system? True democracy does not work, a system based on machine? How does that represent what the people want? You also have a significant population who is illiterate on alot of subjects from trade to economics and then military and social policies. If you relied on the average person, there will never be any clear direction as people are inherently reactionary leading to a change of direction in overall policy alot more often than normal. This becomes highly inefficient and can lead to some bad results.

The second problem is how do we decide when laws should be changed, and how does one write and propose it. A bill is not just some simple law it has alot of detail and legal speak behind it. 

But ignoring all that, whatever system we create the will always be the elite, as they will always have control on which direction to go and how the system is set up. Also because people want someone to show them the way. Why people in China are content with a dictatorship and and having less rights, all because they can live content and not have to care about certain issues."

""Buy lottery tickets and your children can have a great Christmas"" kind-of things."
Government will likely adopt a version of it that is favourable to them and that is the one that will see mass adoption.
People understand. But too little too late.
Lottery: if you don't play, you can't win.
Lottery tickets have defined expected value, which, although it is negative, is fixed.
Come on, i think crypto is cool and a big part of our future. Im invested in it too... you don’t see how this is comparing apples and oranges though? Attitudes like this is why may in mainstream don’t trust crypto and think it’s a scam
"Governments have lotteries because it makes them money. They aren't telling people to use them, or saying it's smart, and they don't themselves buy lottery tickets.

So, the logic checks out. 

If YOU want to buy lottery tickets, then your local government will be happy to take your money. 

I don't see any logical incompatibilities there. If I had the money, and it was legal, I'd sell you lottery tickets too. But I sure as hell wouldn't *buy* any."
actually it's true. 
"Why don't they create a lottery blockchain? Would be more transparent on where the money for the lottery actually goes to.

Quantitative Easing... Boom!

"Ah yes, the lottery - otherwise known as optional taxes. 

Cryptocurrency: A risky way for someone to make honest profit if they play their cards right.

Lotteries are not risky. You are certain that you will lose.
"Also also government: ""We will poison your children"""
"It's super easy for governments to ban crypto.

Step 1- Retailers are not allowed to accept crypto as payment.
Step 2- Foreign retailers are not allowed to accept crypto payments from their citizens
Step 3- Profits from selling crypto are taxed prohibitively.  

Crypto is *cool*, but it isn't crucial.  Nobody (except hardcore geeks and criminals) is going to bother spending useful fiat on crypto that can't be used at stores and can't be resold for profit.  A few relatively easy legislative barriers is all it would take to keep 98% of the population away, and a niche currency is a dead currency."
Listen to what government tells you to do, and do quite opposite
"To be honest, and I am being super optimistic now, the more restrictions they put on crypto the better, why? Because I think the crypto community is now big enough and diversified enough that they can come up with groundbreaking alternatives as much as bitcoin is.. 

Money as a social system is a lot more than currency, and all the supporting institutions, for example like Visa and Mastercard, need to be challenged by new inventions that facilitate the exchange of crypto despite their efforts to cripple it. 

The more restrictions the more resilient and complete the crypto-money system will get. "
People need to educate and digest crypto .
"I thought this was sarcasm. Really, /r/btc?

You can't see the difference between weekly 2$ tickets and putting your entire savings in volatile assets?"
"Also you can only lose $1 on a lottery ticket. Maybe the government would feel safer if everyone would just buy $1 of cryptocurrency. ;)"
Governments don't call cryptocurrencies risky. They call them a speculative bubble. Lottery tickets are gambling, but they're not a bubble. False equivalence.
If the average joe, bought $2 of crypto every week, for the last 9 years, they would be sitting on....
If BTC could publish the odds of gain vs loss, this would be a decent comparison. Also crypto isn't supposed to have a house that always wins.
Also governments: We tax crpto profits.  Please don't invest in them, but if you make money, hehe, here is your tax bill.  
Governments won't be able to avoid or ban this crypto craze. It will all settle down. But we need another 10-20 years.
Pretty sure lotteries will happen regardless if the government runs them or not. Gambling is probably as old as the human species have been bored. By keeping gambling in government hands it's way easier to regulate taxation, guarantee payout, prevent scams, watch out for gambling addiction, etc. It's not perfect but a hell of a lot better than if just about anyone could start one. 
"If governments are open to crypto, their country will attract talents and tech skills and far more tax income due booming innovation wealth. 


Instead, they are clueless. Parasites due extra taxation on their self created monopoly money, sabotage innovation and drive away tech talents. 
Governments are just clueless, even if they mean good or bad, they just don't know how to act. "
"The main difference I think is that the dangers of the lottery (and gambling in general) are well understood by everyone and people have been educated about it for centuries. Everyone understands that you have a very low chance of winning, everyone agrees it's a game and not a proper way to make money, etc.

With cryptocurrencies the same background is missing. Stock trading is similar, but that's not as easily accessible. Also, many people will lead you to believe (not necessarily maliciously) that it is a good investment that almost surely make money, and that you would be stupid to not invest.

I think it is absolutely ok for the governments to warn the common people of cryptocurrency speculation's dangers."

Hard to enforce capital gains on crypto though, since it's so easy to cash out on exchanges in other countries.
Do you think decision of govt towards Cryptocurrency is correct ? Also I need your suggestions . Today , I came to know about this website - https://bnktothefuture.com/  . Is investing in this will be beneficiary or not ?
Only if you sell.

It's good that we can use P2P cryptocurrency-fiat exchange platforms that allow you to freely buy and sell cryptocurrency using local payment methods. Qvolta is the best P2P exchange platform because you can buy or sell Bitcoin, Ethereum and altcoins to fiat and visa versa in one place with the mobile app in a couple of minutes everywhere. Join our trip to the Moon, because we release Qvolta platform soon!

I never bet on Crypto. That's why I still have money. 
The SEC has been talking about crypto for a long time and has made their positions very clear.  Smart money is buying in at each support level.
Better to wait til it hits 5k so you don't just have to redo it tomorrow
I mean in terms of falling from stable levels BTC fell to 7000 from around 17-19k while BCH dropped from stable levels of around 2500 to 900. So they pretty much suffered the same amount of correction in my mind.

haters gonna hate
The crash is happeing because of the SEC talking about regulating Crypto.  Smart money is bailing because regulation is poison to innovation.

the other alt coins looking down is somewhat wrong since they fallen even more
Both crypto and stock market is getting murdered today...it hurts to see all that red, even though I know it's not price that matters, it's adoption
Only thing inaccurate about this meme is that the other coins are still up on the ledge and not falling while trying to save BTC haha

"Because none of those can carry over the network effect and path dependence effects, community and users of being on the same chain as BTC, of being a fork of it, nor the community, much of which left BTC and moved to BCH.

If you had a project designed for BTC, a few lines of code make it ready for BCH. That's not true of other coins which don't share the code-base or chain-history.

These are the same effects that kept BTC on top of all these other coins, until Core took over BTC and began ruining its primary utility as a payment system, thus opening the way for ETH and others."
Crocodile. 
"they confused you on purpose by not making a new symbol for their new coin

BTC was the symbol for Bitcoin until August, on August 1st that Bitcoin stopped existing and in its place are two different Bitcoins, a situation known as a ""chain fork""

BCH is the symbol adopted by Bitcoin Cash, one of the ends of the chain fork

the other end of the chain fork *will not adopt a new name or symbol*, they insist on still being called ""Bitcoin"" and having the symbol ""BTC""-- but this is very confusing, because someone who bought ""BTC"" before August 1st got *both* Bitcoins but someone who buys ""BTC"" now gets *only that* shitty new Bitcoin that they don't want to give a new name"
He means by sw and ln adoption. Fee is measured in sat/b not usd/b, price has nothing to do with fee. I had a confirmed tx with 2sat/b 3 weeks ago when price was around 14k, and trading volume was still high, as every other day. It did cost less than 1 usd.
It probably will to be honest.

do you not understand that dinosaur bones are very rare and expensive
"I absolutely agree that certain things should not be sacrificed in the pursuit of scaling, but I do not think we have hit that limit with BTC or BCH, nowhere close to it. ETH is close to hitting that limit, with current tech its blocksize cant be increased much more without undesirable consequences.

>Since you ask, I will tell you. I am very much in favour of small low fees, but not at the cost of diminished security

I do not see the security of BCH being significantly lower than BTC. 

The ""no blockreward"" thing is many years away, but it is certainly an interesting thing to debate. Once we get to that point, maybe the minimum fee needs to be 10c or something, difficulty needs to be lowered, Idk exactly. But crippling ourselves today in anticipation of a scenario which is 2-3 halfenings off is not the way to go.

I probably wont be able to respond until saturday, but this turned into a somewhat interesting discussion."
"I'm not claiming to be omnipotent or able to see the future, I'm simply explaining current events using current data. 

LN has a total of [5 BTC](https://p2sh.info/dashboar) across all payment channels, and segwit adoption is still [only 14%](http://segwit.party/charts/), a 2% bump since October. 

Transaction fees are lower due to lower usage, and nothing else."
Ok, right, in october yes, i may be wrong about the month, then same example with september and june. It is true if the useage is higher then the fee's go up, nothing surprising about this, more people would pay more to validate their tx in the next block, and they would pay more for this to happen. I'm just saying there is no any long-term conclusion you can make of this, because comparison to historical data not everytime lead to well-guessed future, this is why extrapolations are not reliable. Things changed a lot since those times, the future is kind of unpredictable. I used to say that person who says he/she knows what is happerning in the crypto era is just lying, you can guess, but can not predict. There might be people who are right and who are wrong, but this technology is so new and the behaviour of the people are so unpredictable you can not just simply know what will cause what.
">mean

I didn't say anything about mean, I said the transaction volume is lower now than one year ago, which it is. Roughly 200k transactions yesterday, roughly 300k per day in February 2016. 

>If the low price and volume would  cause lower usage and lower fees, then why wasn't it possible to send transaction in october for the same fee like now

That's literally exactly what happened. [View historical fee history here. ](https://charts.bitcoin.com/chart/transaction-fees)"
Dinosaurs couldn't reclaim their dominance.
Only if you also believe that dinosaurs/reptiles/birds dominate the planet.
"**Dinosaur**

Dinosaurs are a diverse group of reptiles of the clade Dinosauria. They first appeared during the Triassic period, between 243 and 231 million years ago, although the exact origin and timing of the evolution of dinosaurs is the subject of active research. They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the Triassic–Jurassic extinction event 201 million years ago; their dominance continued through the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. The fossil record indicates that birds are modern feathered dinosaurs, having evolved from earlier theropods during the late Jurassic Period.

That is not completely true, just look at the charts at blockchain.info, it is true the tx count and volume is lower than 1-2 months ago, but 1-2 months ago there was an extreme peak of usage. If you look at the mean of these charts [it is clearly visible the usage is in growing trend, just the deviation is higher](https://blockchain.info/charts/n-transactions?timespan=all). 3 weeks ago we still had around 300,000 tx/day, and I could transact with low fee, but since SW and LN is in the picture, it is way lower. If the low price and volume would  cause lower usage and lower fees, then why wasn't it possible to send transaction in october for the same fee like now, when the price was even lower? This analogy is just wrong and not linear at all.
You know, my problem is even if this is true, nobody can prove it for me, because on BCH side behaviour i see only the attack only the propaganda, and only the forceful convincing about and idea, but many times what i read i personally know is not true. Even tho if not everything is a lie, a lot of things are. On the other side of course there are immature people too, who attack BCH for fun, but the most of them and even the so called corps does not do any propaganda and never push us to use what they represent. It will be very hard to convince somebody about truth with attacks, force, 24/7 propaganda when on the other side still feels having the free choice what to use and what to do. Btw i usually transact very rarely but then a huge amount so i don't use SW either LN, and even the high fee is just acceptable for me, so these reasons will not make me chose another coin when the base of my tradings in BTC since years. So the point is, there are too many paradoxes around both coins, but BCH side just seems a bit more violent, that makes it a bit hollow.
The mammals were wiped out by a meteor just as the dinosaurs were. 
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur
Read the first sentence.
I win."
You haven't met an emu.
Thank you for your insight. So basically you're saying that BCH is a short term solution correct? It doesn't solve the problem but it reduces it without much effort. 
"Segwit and LN adoption have nothing to do with lower transaction fees at the moment.  Fees are down because usage is down. 

Daily transaction volume is less than half of its peak in January, and only two thirds of the volume at this same time last year."
The death of dinosaurs allowed the more adaptive mammals to rule.

"Although you were lead to believe so, the parameter you show does not measure decentralization. Say Gavin (Andresen) and Mike (Hearn) had nodes when the UASF happened. Of course they wanted to keep the old form of Bitcoin (without segwit) - but they couldn't - because the ""decentralized"" nodes were all brainwashed by Blockstream (the true power behind core) and voted for segwit. Now, you really think YOU know better than these two what the right path for Bitcoin is?  When your ""decentralized"" coin policy is dictated by a 70 million dollar corp (Blockstream) that pays to control the core developers (and kicks Satoshi's right hand, Gavin, through the door) in addition to controlling the social media and censoring the opposition - then this coin in now hijacked by this corp, controlled by it, and thus centralized."

Thank you!
"Ironic/paradoxical picture.

It's the dinosaurs that get bigger and bigger without limit (Ver says bigger blocksize simple solution herp derp) and get wiped out. While the little crafty squirrels avoid the blast by adapting and evolving clever solutions (SW, LN) and remaining small.

Not as clever a picture as many here are making out.

For those saying the dinosaurs should be looking at the moon, perhaps also have the squirrels have blinkers on, staring unwaveringly at one big squirrel with a big sack of nuts over his shoulder, telling them they're special and that they're definitely absolutely not being scammed."
