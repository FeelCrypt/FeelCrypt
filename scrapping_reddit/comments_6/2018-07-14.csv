Don’t know what other people are saying - they definitely had hit men for hire on there 
Who cares if he was charged with it or not. Anyone that was on it knew what was offered there. Just because of your technicality of charges does not negate the fact crimes against human lives were transacted there. Fucking deal with it and move on from this pointless messiah
My understanding is he did sell his own mushrooms near the start of the site, however I doubt that was a factor in his sentencing.
No.
I said “whether or not you believe the charges are valid” right there in my post.  I personally don’t. 
He was no more directly involved in murder than mafia bosses having others do their bidding , right?

Yes- Bitcoin and all the forks. Even people outside of Bitcoin/alts who believe in justice should support this. 
"So you'd be fine with someone facilitating the exchange of child pornography for profit since they didn't participate themselves?

"
"Nope, there was no actual proof of that. And evidence actually suggests that this was an operation done by the FBI agents (the same corrupt FBI agents that got prosecuted themselves for stealing money during the investigation) in order to further prosecute Ross should they catch him. It was highly likely they were trying to frame him, in other words.

If you mean on the website, no, the market was completely limited to drugs."
Besides: nobody puts google CEOs into prison because they offer a 'plattform to find hitmen'. But watch the Ross Ulbrich story on Netflix. This was FBI trying to make and example. It's disgusting.
"Silk road + all other dark net markets are hardly facilitators of ""victimless crime"". Bread and butter of dark net markets other than the drugs which I personally have no issue with are,  Identity Theft, credit card fraud, PayPal fraud, bank fraud, weapons trafficking, child pornography etc... HARDLY victimless crime.

Afaik Silk Road was the first widely adopted Dark Net market, I could be wrong on that so therefore I agree with the sentencing being way over the top but hey they needed to make an example right?

Whether we agree that the crimes are serious or not, our opinions do not dictate the law."

Get ready for the mass brigade a butt hurts that can't accept his site dealt with other things than drugs and is paying the price for his actions. Peoples efforts could be used on such better things than this dude

Him getting off is good for justice.
"You want to free a guy who is in prison because he was so greedy he couldn't walk away from an obvious prison sentence.

You're delusional 

He wasn't some ideologue, he woulda cut his fees to nothing"
Oh Silkroad wasn't a website? What was it then?
"""guy who ran one of the biggest black market forums the west has ever seen receives clemency for dealing in child porn, murder, and drugs""

Those headlines, that's how

"
"People doing immoral and unspeakable things are breaking the law. Banning roads because people use them to facilitate doing unspeakable things is concerning. 

We should collectively work to stop unspeakable things happening to people but I'm not sure Ross is responsible for the people who do immoral and unspeakable things. 

I for one don't even agree with United States citizens paying to kill people at weddings in other countries. Not only does it foster hate it's also immoral.

Why are they all not in jail already."
"how can you ban something on a site that allows for private transactions and private communications?

"
BTC is not Bitcoin. This fork broke the cryptographic chain of signatures which defines the Bitcoin protocol as per the whitepaper
Love it lol
"He was never ~~charged or~~ tried for the murder allegations, yet the judge used that, as well as his political beliefs, to justify his sentence.

Edit: correction. He was charged but never convicted."
"> His charges were drug trafficking

Despite not selling any drugs ever.

>conspiracy to murder

Wrong but facts don't matter right?"
I agree that's a strong argument that BTC isn't bitcoin.
.....Ohh they were dismissed so it must have not happened....
He was harshly penalized by a morally backup government for an act that did not involve any form of aggression or had any victim prosecuting him. Victimless crimes has nothing to do with justice.
He should be punished.  Certainly.  but a double life sentence with no chance of parole?  C'mon.   That's not justice.
"The whole point of crypto is to help create a more just world...for example, by facilitating more anonymous transactions for things that government has unjustly prohibited (and thus created violence and poverty around).

What, you think that those of us who got involved early just wanted to create a slower, less user-friendly payment network than the centralized services we were already using because.... reasons?"
"You sure?

You're blinded by greed, and it's making you promote injustice in the world. You're also wrong. Injustice is not good for markets long-term. Corruption is not good for markets long-term.

When you say “you all”, you mean all Americans?
I'm not interested in politicizing an issue like this. Bitcoin or any of the forks- it should be non-partisan. 
You believe he should have his life taken away for this?  Really?  Punished yes...but his life???

"So let's assume he's innocent of everything but running open forum where people can make crypto transactions and communicate privately. 

I'm not sure how teh site was designed, but assuming he didn't have a ""buy child porn here"" or ""contract your local hitman"" section I'm ok with what he was doing. Having an open site is bound to attract some fucked up shit. So i'll give him a pass on that

But I don't see why any of us should give a shit because he was making money on it he coulda walked away at any time. He did not. "

"if you think helping this guy is good for the market you're delusional, period.

those would be terrible headlines for us reenforcing the notion crypto is for dope dealers, hitmen, and pimps. "
Is this the justice forum or crypto forum
He broke the law. Sounds like justice was served. Whether you agree with the law is one thing, but he knew damn well what laws he was breaking and the risks associated. 
Child porn, assassinations, and stolen credit cards were explicitly banned on Silk Road: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road_(marketplace)#Products
His charges were drug trafficking and conspiracy to murder.  I know people here can be intentionally obtuse but geeze.

"On top of the conversation most likely being fabricated by the FBI agents after the acquisition of the website, I love how fake the conversation reads.

> Necessities like this do happen from time to time for a person in my position.

Really. From running a website that *hosts* drug vending. And what kind of malware planted on Lucydrop would find details on *other* vendors? What would the vendors be doing sharing information like that? I remember Lucydrop, he was a big LSD vendor who was clearly handling his own with supply, isolated from other vendors."
"100% true, done

No, just conspiracy to launder money (lol) and other conspirational bullshit
"Cryptocurrency and agorism go hand-in-hand. Ross was the ultimate agorist. Freeing someone that enabled peaceful trade is per se good for crypto.

In addition, getting him off would be good for crypto if nothing more than because Ross is a good person and will have a net positive effect on the world."
"You absolutely have obligations. You cannot willingly facilitate crimes, and you cannot just claim you didn't know.

For example, web hosts have very real legal obligations to remove illegal content once they are made aware of it. You'll get in a shit load of trouble if someone tells you that there is CP on your severs and you ignore it and profit from it."
"He lived in a one-bedroom apartment and didn't sell any of his BTC earnings for personal use. He did have employees that he need to pay though, so cutting the fees to nothing wasn't really possible. So, describing him as greedy is just wrong.

But, even if he were greedy, so what? Why would that condemn him to life in prison? He built something successful that was used by thousands of people to peacefully trade with each other, he deserved whatever wealth he earned."
Didn’t they also have people hiring hit men and other unspeakable things?
I thought there was some bit about him trying to hire a hitman and assassinations. Did he not get charged for that?
yeah no thanks lmfao... dude ordered a hit on someone. he can rot in jail. 
go everyone
"FFS people him getting off is not good for crypto

The guy was at best a greedy idiot

Fuck him"
Public listings for such goods weren't allowed. Plenty of platforms allow private communications, so I'm not sure what point you're trying to make.
Done
Believe the charges were true or not, he’s definitely not serving double life “for a website”
Does it actually make any sense to do this as a non US citizen?
Anyone that actually visited the site knew that is a fact. To deny it is to either ignore facts, try to cover them up or be oblivious to them yourself because you are on some dumb bandwagon

"I don't think you quite know what the word ""delusional"" means. It also seems that you're not really familiar with the details of the Ulbricht case, and yet you've formed strong opinions nonetheless. In general, I'd suggest you get all the facts before you form strong opinions."
That's one way of looking at it, and it's a valid view. Personally, I think it should be the police's job to stop those who willingly produce and distribute illegal content. Just as a landlord isn't responsible for a tenant who breaks the law, the owner of a website shouldn't be responsible for the users' actions.
You visited the website and saw that?
If the government made a drug illegal that you needed in order to live a non-meaningless existence for reasons that were clearly immoral, would you be fine with imprisoning the person who attempted to make those medicines available to you?
Didn't he order a hit on someone....
"He has made a killing

">  the fact crimes against human lives were transacted there

Source?"
"He literally wasn't charged for ""conspiracy to murder"" - at least not in the jurisdiction that actually went to trial. He is convicted of the following charges ([directly from his indictment on justice.gov](https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/usao-sdny/legacy/2015/03/25/US%20v.%20Ross%20Ulbricht%20Indictment.pdf)):

 * Narcotics trafficking conspiracy
 * Continuing criminal enterprise
 * Computer hacking conspiracy
 * Money launder conspiracy

He was indeed indicted for murder-for-hire in another jurisdiction, but that indictment never went to trial, so Ross never had a chance to defend those allegations (they likely would not have stuck because everything around the supposed murder-for-hire involved the FBI agents that were later criminally charged for stealing bitcoin and other corrupt activity surrounding the Silk Road investigation. For all we know, it was one of these corrupt agents that called for the supposed hits).

Nonetheless, the judge in Ross's case explicitly used these unproven allegation in the sentencing - something that *should* be unconstitutional. But the Supreme Court is refusing to hear arguments for why using unproven allegations to guide sentencing is wrong.

So, yeah, ""serving double-life for a website"" is a pretty accurate summary of Ross's situation."
Corrected
Free Ross 
Ticker BTC and ticker BCH. We can disagree on what is actually deserving of the name and still agree on other things.
Speaking of which, those mafia bosses pay their underlings in *money*, the transfers of which are facilitated by *banks*. So while we're at it, let's lock up all the bank CEOs too, right?
From rachel
If you make a website for anonymously sharing photos, are you responsible for the content of the photos uploaded by the anonymous users of your website?  If you build a road, are you responsible for the contents of the cars that use that road?
It’s not called “b cash” and you probably know that. It’s bitcoin cash, and if/when it has more accumulated POW, it will become bitcoin and the current bitcoin will become bitcoin core or bitcoin legacy 
Regardless of anything BCH does it’ll never become BTC (Bitcoin)
