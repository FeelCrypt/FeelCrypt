"Litecoin is never meant to profit from the downfall of Bitcoin. It's to complement Bitcoin. And Bitcoin won't die from this.

Your question is directed at Brian, so he should answer it."
Depends how much money the miners stand to make by ignoring or manipulating users
For a moment I was convinced I had been struck down by the autocorrect gods.
I'd find it pretty inconvenient to explain to every merchant and investor that Bitcoin died, their coins are now worthless, and that they need to switch to Ethereum, which will totally not fail in the same way because reasons, and is secure even though it doesn't have any hashing power.
Because FTP isn't a thing?
it will once it reaches the threshold. you do realize that's how it works right?  brian can't just will it to fork
I don't believe a compromise is possible. People have very different visions for Bitcoin and there's no reconciliation possible. Let's divorce and have each group follow its path.

Thank you!
"He answered with a ""what"" - the difference in number system, which is also a ""why"".  "
Brian. I love Bitcoin and currently hedging with ethereum so I can pick up some cheaper coins later. Do you guys have any plans to add ethereum to your exchange? 
"The fact that Luke-jr even considers tonal bitcoin to be an altcoin is just another one of his delusions that he continues to assert. Tonal bitcoin is not an altcoin, it's just a UI change which shows your bitcoins in a different number system.

How did we let this delusional person acquire so much power over bitcoin's fate?"
And we can raise the max block size to 2MB.
"I am glad you posted.

You should know that the 50% is just an assumption. An assumption that is likely to be true *after* the difficulty adjustment (or two) but between the halving and the difficulty adjustment, we could see anything from near 0 switch off to all miners switching off (other than the hard-core)"
You could hire me as your proof reader. I work for a reasonable rate paid in cold hard bitcoin.
Very good point! The same thing happened during bitcoin's last halving event. The hashrate did not drop off, the price went up, and the number of transactions per second shot up. Since the number of transactions cannot go any higher than it is at the moment it is very likely we won't see any major rise in price which would otherwise come with it.

"/u/ChangeTip , Awesome! 1000 bits.

Any sane Bitcoin company must at this point be at least *investigating* alternative cryptocurrency support. They may well have experimental code for it ready to go. But I suspect that when big infrastructure companies like Coinbase flip the switch to enable those alternatives it'll be the true death-knell for Bitcoin so I'm not surprised they're working quietly right now. The last thing you want to do is trigger the final rush to the exits and then end up having bugs in your code that make you unable to follow through yourself.
"Monero solves problems of privacy & anonymity.  Valued heavily, as evidenced by the enduring value of gold.  Monero is digital gold; solving the same problems.

That being said, ETH is also awesome, and I think it would be great for coinbase to add ETH, DOGE, LTC, and XMR."
Bingo.
"It's not about compromising with Core. It's about getting everybody else to realize how Core is just a small and isolated band of zealots. This would have already occurred if nk didn't censor/ban the discussion. 

We've got to build a coalition of partners. The technical side of things is already done, now it's time for the PR campaign. That's where Brian can help."
it can be re-targeted.
That's how it works because that's how it's coded. Anyone could fork the blockchain at any time if they code it differently.
It will adjust instantly if I have most of the hashrate and do a hard fork to adjust it. 
"brian, and the pro-classic people, are not trying to create an alt-currency here. bitcoin has a mechanism to upgrade itself and that's what we're trying to get to.  

Core has already stipulated that they agree to a hardfork to upgrade to 2MB.  The quibble now is over the parameters of this upgrade: 75% vs 95%, now or in 18mos..."
"> and that they need to switch to Ethereum

Ethereum will have the same issues.

Vultures and toxic characters like (not necessarily them) /u/luke-jr, /u/peter_todd and /u/nullc will crawl in through the cracks and try to create political disruption.

On the other hand, the world needs a decentralized crypto currency because it has a lot of utility.

If the Bitcoin ecosystem cannot reject bad actors in time, I'm sure that an other system will eclipse it.

Merchants and businesses will gather around the strongest network effect.
"
I want something that's *not* animated.
Mining is catching up. Hash rates can't be directly compared since the algorithms are different, but Ethereum spends 1/5 as much money on block rewards to secure 1/10 as much value. Mining hasn't been super profitable so that's a good indication of mining effort, and the difficulty is rising fast.
"> Litecoin is never meant to profit from the downfall of Bitcoin. 

Seriously, what other reason would there be for you personally to support crippling the Bitcoin network to prevent it from growing?

> It's to complement Bitcoin. 

Sure. Same as all those other clone coins ;-)

> And Bitcoin won't die from this.

While hopefully true, it will set it back a few years. Or maybe Bitcoin will end up being just another alt-coin."
True, Tonal Bitcoin was never meant to be an altcoin, but it was something Luke was very familiar with and used as an example of what *could* be justification for *somebody* to create and alt. He completely left that part out of his answer without even realizing it.
"The problem of maintaining anonimity roots outside of the scope of the protocol.

So no, xmr is irrelevant and will stay that way imo.

Doge and ltc are lowly, worthless clones.

"
I agree that it is a really bad justification for wanting to create another cryptocurrency.
That is a fallacy. It competes in the p2p money aspect directly.
You seem to think that the difficulty instantly adjusts. The problem is that it only adjusts after 2016 blocks.
Bitcoin is more like HTTP than TCP/IP. HTTP is good because it's been gradually improved/extended over the decades by the various different teams that have implemented it, and the extensions that worked well got adopted by all the implementations.
Psst, he doesn't know that.
you're shilling for Coinbase!
Satoshi?
It's the only one for the internet.
"Only if people recognize your hard fork as legitimate. An emergency hard fork would hopefully be done, sure. But it would be a huge mess. And remember only yesterday people were losing their shit because Luke was proposing to be prepared for this kind of emergency.

I was only pointing out that a drop of 50% is far from worst case."
"Damn. It's not the fist time I make this mistake! 

Since you insist I'll leave it there :-)"
Oh yes that explains why people are developing altcoins. /s
Blockstream?
Yes. At this stage, the cut-off is unpredictable. It could be anywhere from barely detectable to all but the most hard-core. This 50% meme needs to die.
"> Not really if demand starts hitting bigger than offer.

Who would want an apparently centrally planned ""decentralized"" CrippleCoin?"
"Ok i will take it back. You're just a moron who believes bitcoin has some sort of intrinsic value , ""mining cost"", which set a floor price. Hence halving just mean doubling the floor price. 

While in fact nothing has intrinsic value, value is from utility. Bitcoin is no exception. 

Gosh i already feel stupid just repeating that you believe.

Thanks!
At some point he has to support ETH. I'm sure his investors are hating the fact Coinbase exchange is missing out on fees from all the trading volume. 
"Oh that's so sad.

It blows my mind that some ideas are so dangerous they should not be shared. 
"
"> You could hire me as your proof reader.

I think that's supposed to be ""proofreader"" (one word).  

;)"
Yeah, I figured that. Just threw in my own spin :)
Also difficulty tripled in last 3 months. This means that there was great investment in hardware, which is big part of cost. Running miners is not only electricity and space buy also amortisation of hardware.
Did I wake up in 2008 *again*?
the sad thing is he's not the only one. 
">How did we let this delusional person acquire so much power over bitcoin's fate?

Maybe because the majority of people are dumb."
"Lol so why do we have alts? Because decimal. And he's the enlightened leader that understand the economic and psychology of what's creating the value in that space.

No way should someone who's that ignorant be in a leadership role on this project. Still I agree with his point but in all honestly that just describes 1 incidence in a 1000.

And it's the exception not the rule."
But Luke's wasn't even an altcoin was it? He was trying to get it merged into the main branch.
"Yeah. And to be fair, there's a whole branch of mathematics that goes down that path and apparently, it makes whole fields work out a whole lot easier.

But when you're working with human beings that have a whole mathematical and economic convention thing going on, that's just not appropriate."
"it's worse than you say, it's the reason given as to why other people are creating other cryptocurrencies.

it shows a lack of communication skills, firstly the lack of comprehension skill and 2nd the lack of skill to empathise and to express. 

I trust his coding ability but I don't trust his judgment on other matters at all like planning and economics etc. "
Bargain rather than fight.  He's no Jedi.
ETH has been good to me, but it's not really designed to be money based in P2P.
Yeah that scenario was worst-case, he should have used most-likely case. Maybe something where 20% quit which I think is still quite unlikely. Lots of good points though, hopefully this puts some wind behind the classic team's sails.
ROFL
"This whole blocksize issue really comes down to folks having different visions on what bitcoin is/should be. 

 If you're on the business side and prefer to see global and mainstream adoption, you will likely side with Classic in the hopes that this is the best way to accelerate forward.  Businesses are interested in this direction.

On the other hand, if you think that bitcoin should remain a (very solid) project settlement system, with no compromises and all of its integrity intact, then stick with core, but you won't be seeing accelerated innovation or mass adoption anytime soon.  Idealists or folks not looking for opportunity will fit best in this camp.

I believe the business folks should move to another altcoin.  This way, they can rapidly develop and innovate without core dragging them down."
"I am still confused - why is everyone complaining that ""Core"" is stopping progress. So what if they disagree - either you have the majority who are willing to go with your hard fork or you don't. If you do, then get on with it. If you don't, then find out why you have failed to convince the majority and stop blaming 10 people hanging out in their clubhouse. And if we are going to parse majority vs. consensus, 10 people do not make the difference.   x-posted this comment from r/bitcoin"
So you're so against Core and Blockstream that you would be willing to give complete control to another, smaller company (Coinbase)? Because that's basically what you're doing.

"Just got off the bed.

I'm doing the translation right now :D"
"I disagree. I side with Brian in general and of course we need to increase blocksize, but I don't think his doomsday halving scenario is accurate. Miners have been mining ~$200 coins for months and months and the sky didn't fall, 12 x $400 coins is the same as the past September 25 x $200 coins. 

Also I don't think having many teams competing developing Bitcoin is as simple and risk free as he says, and I still have a glimmer of hope that some middle ground can and should be reached.

That being said it was an interesting post with many valid and concerning points."
"BTCGuild used to be a very popular US based mining pool up until they closed last summer.  They cited the NY BitLicense regulation as the deciding factor.

More importantly though there has be a huge shift in the hash power distribution in the past 2 years from small - medium size operators to a handful of major players."
You so well captured the environment over there.  I have a degree in psychology, but I am having trouble identifying what is going on over there.
It should be a sticked post for a while.
And those that knew an important vote was coming up could save their days destroyed for the important vote, letting less-informed people waste theirs on less-important votes.
I've basically given up as well. Sold 85% of my holdings in the last three weeks. It went mostly to fiat and some ETH.
Not really surprising. I'm somewhat that way myself.
All fixed - wrote it too fast in between other things. Thx for the fixes!
"We certainly don't want to place all the responsibility for protecting Bitcoin and providing guidance for its development into thge hands of one or a few large corporations.

By not trying to ""define what Bitcoin is"" /u/bdarmstrong is being ethical - which is exactly the opposite of what Blockstream is doing.  He's making an appeal to the community to broaden the development base.  As part of that effort, we certainly want Coinbase to contribute, but we shouldn't want them to ""just do it.""  I don't want Coinbasecoin any more than I want Blockstreamcoin, I want bitcoin.  The last thing we need is to replace Blockstream with Coinbase as overlord of Bitcoin.  Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.  Thankfully, /u/bdarmstrong isn't trying to be the new boss."
"What a lot of people get wrong about intelligence is they think there's only one kind. 

But there are many different types of intelligence like verbal, social, rhythmic, mathematical, etc. 

Core devs apparently score high on the math side of things, but low on verbal and social. They need to utilize a different form of intelligence -- introspection -- to look within, acknowledge their weaknesses and collaborate with others to compensate for them."
"...in which case you have to start questioning the ""highly intelligent"" descriptor."
This has nothing to do with god.
There's a reason we are trying to get miners on board instead of just forking and picking a different hashing algorithm: Infrastructure costs a lot of money and work and is important for the network. ETH doesn't have any infrastructure yet.

"I especially like this:

> By upgrading to BitcoinClassic it does not mean we need to stay with the Classic team forever, it simply is the best option to mitigate risk right now. We can use code from any team in the future.

some people seem to be afraid of using a client from a different team because that would somehow give the keys to the kingdom to a bunch of random unknowns. Well they're not unknown of course, but having the network switch from a client developed by one team to a client developed by another sets a great precedent, in that bitcoin doesn't NEED a monopoly on reference client development. The Core team did well in the past and they might do well in the future again, having Classic take over in the mean time does nothing to change that. If the Classic team messes everything up, then we can switch right back again or to somebody else, we are not locked in!"
"This gives me more hope than I've had in a while. The time for polite talking is over, industry needs to take a decisive stand, and Brian is in a fantastic position to rally people behind the right path for Bitcoin's longterm success.

/u/bdarmstrong - a deep thank you for stepping up. I'm sure this is not something you want to have spend your time on, but it's acutely necessary and very possibly the difference between a Bitcoin that changes the world, and yet another uninspiring settlement system."
"I just read the /r/bitcoin version of this comments thread. 

It was like walking into another iteration of the universe... like what I imagine a bar being like the day before enemy tanks are cruising through the streets, or the zombie apocalypse is finally named as such. 

The whole situation has become utterly surreal to me. Almost three years ago I got into Bitcoin and it blew my mind. I was and remain chagrined that I hadn't paid enough attention earlier to this project, but I stand here crestfallen to see how it has deteriorated. 

I know that Adolf Thermostler isn't Core. I know not all the Core devs are malicious, ignorant, sociopathic, immature, and bribed or outright bought. I know /r/bitcoin isn't the whole Bitcoin community. But I want the Bitcoin I signed up for, back. I want a divorce from this shitball mess I'm standing in when I look at the /r/bitcoin comments from this post, and the /r/btc comments from this post. 

I'm shellshocked. It's like losing a religion. This situation could civil-war itself out to a grinding, nasty, mud-flung mess, and I suspect it eventually will. But will anyone be around to witness the last two idiots arguing about who is attacking what? 

But that said; Brian, you're a light in a dark place. Hang in there. "
"Great assessment of the core team dynamics Brian.  Let's hope Bitcoin becomes something more than a HBS case study of groupthink and another team who let their achilles heel destroy them.

But why did you listen to the movie-plot FUD scenario concerning halving?  ""Doing something about halving"" is exactly where the misguided attempt to push up fee rates came from!  The halving schedule is definitional.  The market has ALREADY been adapting to the upcoming halving for 6 years.
"
"Brian Armstrong is so right on. He's the adult in the room. But man would it suck to have your VC backed venture potentially unravel because a wildly innovative technology was passed to the wrong group. 

Core today. Classic tomorrow. Coreless forever. "
The comments on this over at r/bitcoin are lunacy.  This ship is going down over there.
"Having developers in charge of maintaining a product is in general not a good idea. Bitcoin functionality is a personal/business product, and like any other product is best served by having business and systems analysts on the team to help provide guidance to the software engineers as to the goals of the endeavor. System logic often ignores business logic, if left to itself. 
Bitcoin will continue to languish as long as it is perceived as a quirky off the wall product dominated by computer geeks. Most of the scalability debate I'm reading deals with technical options.
Here we are calling Bitcoin 'the people's currency' but I don't see much input from the non-technical/mining users of Bitcoin. We needed scaling yesterday - to get wider acceptance from the general public. It can't take hours to validate the purchase of a cup of coffee. "
Major bitcoin businesses will likely fund a non-profit dedicated to bitcoin development. 
"u/bdamrstrong, please reach out to all the exchanges owners first. Get them onboard to move forward with Classic. 

Then reach to miners and let them know. They can stay on Blockstream chain if they want. 
Then FORK . 

Its time to let bitcoiners know the importance of economic majority"
Fantastic article, we've been saying these things for months but it's nice to have them all in one place
"This post is 100% correct. 

Anyone with logical reasoning skills would appreciate the arguments Brian has made supporting Classic. It's time for the Chinese pools to switch over and give confidence to future users and businesses."
75% feels high to me, actually. That is the standard for a new U.S. constitutional amendment. I feel like the realistic chances of a new amendment ended years ago. Thankfully this community is not that size yet, but even so hitting 75% will be a considerable feat. 
Not a word about mining centralized in... of all places... China?
An eloquent voice of reason in this debate.

"I doubt the claim that Core has that much high IQ devs. 

Because Greg Maxwell is just a single person. And he proves that having some higher IQ can lead to handicapped social skills.

In contrast having some retarded social skills, like Jr and Todd, does not magically result in some higher IQ. That assumption is in fact simply wrong."
"""We in the community need to do a better job building relationships with the Chinese miners.""

This needs to be phrased to say that we, as a bitcoin community not only need to do a better job with building a relationship with minors, but others as well.  Since I've joined the bitcoin community, I've seen so much aggressiveness, volatile personalities, and BS responses to people who are genuinely concerned about bitcoin and the issues that it's currently having. "
Once again Brian emerges as the mature voice of reason. I see a bright future for him in the Bitcoin world
Spaghetti was eaten. Drinks were drunk.
I absolutely agree with you, but I think there's a huge camp of people that do not.
"I would dare to say, obstinately refusing for an increase in the block size limit is not the right answer for Bitcoin to succeed in an open community-driven environment. 

It may be the right answer if you are building a bonsai, nice to look at in your own isolated environment, which does not help the majority of people."
"Seconded; add Monero to your list of alts that should be on coinbase."
"It would be easier.

Tomorrow we could change the PoW removing the toxic elements from the system, making changes like a retarget or blocksizelimit increase easy."
"I didn't want to, and I found I rejected Mikes exit statement, although weakly. But then I found myself explaining over and over again why it's fucked unless things change. But change is hard to come by, and now blockshit-core is sleepwalking everybody into the abyss. Questions kept nagging at me, questions I'd have answered differently in the years past. Questions like ""Would you recommend it to anybody?"" or ""Can adoption happen?"" or ""Is it reliable?"" and those questions I couldn't answer anymore in the positive, none of them. I could only answer them in the form of ""If bitcoin somehow survives this there's a slim chance..."".

I can't afford to bet on that chance (and finally, I didn't). I don't want to associate with something that's become a huge clusterfuck and headache, endless bickering and only dark road ahead, even if it gets out of it somehow in the end. The spell is broke, the vision is dark, it's where the road ends. It's how Bitcoin ends most likely."
Sold 75% of mine last week too. Core killed the golden goose.

"Thanks for this, Brian. I happen to be a professional text editor (in SF) and noticed a handful of other corrections.

I believe you're among a select few showing real leadership in this space right now. 

Edit: The most immediate change would be: ""Hilary"" has two ""l""s. ;)"
"Also ""segregated witness"" was only capitalized the last time it was used, but not the first couple times.  Seems like it should be all or none.  

Excellent piece, though.  Thanks for writing it."
But when you're trying to build a coalition, it's best not to get too far out ahead of it. Lead, but do it deliberately. He also went to the roundtable. Brian is seeking compromise and not behaving like a zealot. That's a good thing, because we see a lot of uncompromising zealousness on the other side. 
"That is a common meme about intelligence, but I have found that people whom I see as being very intelligent have the ability to translate.  Real intelligence is not expressed by depth of fluency in one language, but rather by the deep understanding of structure of language itself and thus truly intelligent people demonstrate the ability to see the connections between different languages and move fluidly between them - speech is form of social expression, which is rhythmic, and those rhythms are mathematical algorithms which you can code to express a philosophical idea in the world.  Any well trained person can excel in a particular field with discipline and time.  Intelligence is the ability to see the intimacies of the interrelationships between the fields and thereby use your depth in one to be able to communicate complex ideas in and about the others.

So if you're a really good coder who can't communicate in a social environment it's because you're not that intelligent - though you might still be a very good coder.   "
"> But there are many different types of intelligence like verbal, social, rhythmic, mathematical, etc.

No that's a bunk theory. Look up the g factor. Intelligence really is just one thing, but just because you're smart doesn't mean you're socially adept or wise."
The irony is that this censorship supports Brian's call for going to r/btc. People who read Brian's blog post will go to r/bitcoin and not find his blog post, and then venture here.

Eth is the logical choice in my opinion. Monero is a non answer to a non existing problem.

You gotta love how a comment rated -6 appears at the top!"
"The problem is developers don't want/think they need input from business analysts or other's with ""soft skills.""  The vast majority of crypto related companies seem to be founded by developers who only hire developers.  The attitude is that if they build a good technical system people will find them and use it, even if it's difficult to understand/use and doesn't address problems the average user has. Obviously this is flawed thinking.


Too often, the founders/developers ignore the need for business development, sales, marketing, product management, etc. roles.  I'm actively looking to work in the industry and have relevant experience, knowledge, and soft-skills to contribute, but because I can't code, there don't seem to be relevant jobs to even apply to."
Major Bitcoin business should finance miners by tipping them for every Classic block mined.
"The best solution would be to ""extra fund"" the miners mining the Classic blocks.
Every time a transaction is done, the block including the transaction get a fee.
Allow the wallet to ""automatically"" send the same amount of the fee paid to the last mined Classic block blockchain transaction.

Send Y coin to X
Send F(ee) amount to last Classic Block Coinbase
Fee

In effect the Classic blocks would share these tips.
The few would get more, but as more try to get the tips, the they would share them.

This would prioritize Classic miners to mine Classic supporting transactions.

If 5% of the blocks support 50% of the users, they would get their x fees plus 10x tips (with fees around 1% of the reward, the tips would become relevant and interesting to mine). And the larger reward for the earlier miners would someway offset the variability of block mining."
China is a cesspool of bad loans, malinvestment, cheap electric, and follow the leader mentality.  I do business every day with them and they are great people, but their country is totally fucked up by their crazy government and go along attitude.  Of course bitcoin mining is centralized in China.  When they discover ETH, they will drop BTC like a hot piece of coal and pile in.
Yes, I have seen good evidence of moderate to high intelligence from gmax and Back, but none from Todd (quite the opposite really). I consider gavin and Hearn to be intelligent. All based on their ability to argue cogently.
"> need to do a better job with building a relationship with minors

Be careful, you can get arrested for this.  Stay out of teen chatrooms and don't go to some house with candy and condoms if a girl tells you her parents are out and you should come over.  You don't want to end up on ""Dateline."" "
"> On the other hand, if you think that bitcoin should remain a (very solid) project settlement system, with no compromises and all of its integrity intact

Please tell me why anyone would base their currency or asset on Bitcoin right now when its blocks are full and fees are rising? If the users go then the value goes. If all that's left is a bank settlement system then why start with an open system not designed for your purpose instead of creating your own shared database?

Respect for integrity should be shown to the original intention of the limit - a temporary spam measure - and it should be removed as satoshi proposed (and everyone accepted at the time) before it becomes a problem."
"Yes. It could also be much more than 50%. In theory, we could end up with only the hard-core mining at a significant loss.

After the difficulty adjustment, it should head to around 50% but between the halving and the adjustment, we could see a big switch-off, nothing at all or anywhere in-between depending on the financial circumstances and particular miner attitudes."
"Core can adopt BIP109 any time it likes, removing the incentive for many to switch to a new dev team.  

By not doing this, they are gambling with their own users' loyalty and the very control they value so much."
Be the change you wish to see.
"Actually it's more complicated.

If enough speculators are waiting for the halving it will be a crash.

Miners will be on the losing edge as the reward halves and potentially the exchange rate too.

one thing is certain:

The fair value of CrippleCoin is $0 "
