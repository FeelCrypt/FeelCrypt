"That's the prime reason cryptocurrency interests me. It has an enormous potential to help the poor by giving them control over their own money. They don't have to play by the ultra-rich's bullshit rules. It's not perfect, but it just might be a tool to help them claw their way up.

Another reason Core shenanigans disgust me."
I read such comments on rbitcoin! Of course, without /s. Could not believe it.
If you want to serve the poor, you'll need a scaling solution and not bigger blocks. You need a decentralized node network to remain immutable. Such a scaling solution is LN. This needs segwit and fixed tx malleability, so this is a thing that Bitcoin cash cannot have.
Transferwise cost me 3€ from Germany to the Philippines. I actually used Bitcoin until a month ago, I was forced to find another way to send 200€. Waiting for Filipino exchanges to accept BCH or any other crypto aside from BTC.
"first off, expat Filipinos make around 600-1000 USD a month. second a bank transfer costs at most 25$ western union 25$ moneygram 10$
so you are just scare mongering. last thing is bitcoin can solve these minor fees. shitcoin trash(bch) will not. p craig wright roger ver all con men have you all brainwashed, sunken investment syndrome here"
Isn't he broke from his businesses. How could he transfer that much money if he doesn't have it. His ego is making things worse. Wish he would stop being quoted, find someone else who says the same things 
Or just get a debit card and send it to your family, then they just pay a $3 ATM fee and withdraw it instantly whenever they need it...

Don't tell me that a core shill is in charge of rebit.ph fml.

Of course, pretty much everyone likes money. There's absolutely nothing wrong with that, so long as you're providing some utility in exchange for it. Unlike Core's nonsense."
Precisely one of the reasons I think r/monero will end up on top in the long term. 
Actually, Moneygram cost me $9.99 from Canada to the Philippines.

/u/Godfreee, will rebit.ph be working with BCH soon? Those fees must be doing a number on your profit margins.
I have family in Iran. That shit don’t work. Not that they need to be sent money though.
Yeah I've been scare mongering when fees rised to 5 cents, then I was scare mongering as fees rised to 50 cents, now I'm scare mongering at $5 fee and I guess I will be scare mongering in the future when fees reach $50
bitcoin avg fee is 15$
Keep holding your breath for ln (protip it's not coming)
"You can do LN without segwit. Blockstream and Core claim it is ""harder"" to do it, but they never give a solid answer as to exactly how much harder it would be. In other words, you've been lied to repeatedly about that non-issue. Also, tx malleability can be removed using Flexible Transactions. Also, good luck on getting somebody in the Philippines living on lower class wages to run a full node when their data limit is 2GB per month or less. They wouldn't even be able to do it if blocks were just 100KB."
"Agree, and that's why big bankers like Jamie Dimon keep trashing Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general; because they have no control over the blockchain. They can't create money out of thin air just like that. They can't stop anyone from sending funds to whomever they wish.

Being freed from the shackles of fiat is what it's all about, in my opinion. Some are into cryptocurrencies to make a quick buck or two, but in the end, is that profit you make really worth sacrificing the freedom and privacy cryptocurrencies have to offer?"
A centralized mutable coin? Why? Why not Litecoin?
With respect, I don't see how that contradicts what I said. The idea is that BCH would cost you $0.01 at most.

"This is equivalent to complaining about the Internet not being able to stream HD movies in 1995...   
Give it time. Bitcoin is not ready for mainstream adoption.   
Cool your jets. "
Bitcoin was meant for financial sovereignty, it is only possible in the block chain. Bitcoin Core is expelling everyone from bitcoin's block chain, even the rich. I stopped using Bitcoin long ago.
Yep, I did remittances to my family in the Philippines. It would take a month to clear. In that mean time, the USD deposited in the bank would be inaccessible. This is the use case that makes BCH so valuable.
Bitcoin lived long enough to see itself become the villain
"Exactly. The one thing the majority of people don't ask or just completely ignore to ask is: WHY did Bitcoin's price just exponentially grow despite all the media and financial ""experts"" attacks on it. It was because it served the MASSES for the first few years of its lifetime before the spike in transaction fees became an issue. Just imagine McDonalds or Ford motors -- they didn't become rich by appeasing the rich class but by serving all the masses. In fact, they have a business motto at McDonalds: ""Serve the classes live like the masses but serve the masses and you get to live like the classes"". Bitcoin Cash is returning the original vision of Bitcoin and making Bitcoin great again!"

"Thanks, it’s not my first language.

I’m sold. This is the Bitcoin that has a purpose and utility. I like innovation, so I already have ETH and I’ll try to get some BCH too.

"Rest assured, my emotions are in check on trades :) 
When you go from 21 mil. to 42 coins (half of them on 'slow' chain and one of them on 'fast' chain) and 34 mil is in hands of the old holders, then I know what's going on: ""printing money"" - the inflation on the BCH side, along with massive price manipulation is not healthy - and yes, maybe in the long run there's some chance it gets being something with real value, but right now it's just a way for some Korean mobsters and Roger to get quickly generated blocks and rewards and cash out as soon as enough dumb people bought in.  
(and yes, I see the Bitcoin problems as well, high fees àre a problem, but that's why I use litecoin for all inter-exchange trades, sometimes ARK even...)  and NXT (yes, it's a pre-mine with little value, but ALL features that are now brought in to bitcoin and bch are already in place there for years... even the Proof of Stake ... )"
"> I agree with you here, the 21 million bitcoin limit is the most valuable principle of bitcoin. This is something shared with bitcoin cash

bitcoin has a force that is similar to inflation - rising fees that make addresses unspendable. comparable outcome to inflation."

"> 10 years ago, we had 3mb storage devices and 10kb/s download speeds...

10 years ago we had 1TB drives and 8MB/sec internet.  We're looking at a fairly consistent gain of network speed and drive space somewhere around 25%/year.

Also, if Bitcoin gained mass adoption, the number of nodes would likely also climb.  A lot.  Especially if the required hardware was kept lightweight."
"Look, it's this simple, as a user, how could I trust putting my Ether in any wallet when it seems the code or whatever other logic is going on behind the scenes is too complicated for even the developers and they're making fundamental mistakes and they're getting hundreds of millions of dollars in other people's money lost or frozen permanently? Ethereum seems to let people shoot themselves in the foot quite easily.

I don't have any use for smart contracts. I just want to buy stuff. Other coins can do that too. Smart contracts will come to BTC and BCH. No advantage to Ethereum here only first mover advantage in the smart contract space.

The coin is inflationary, it's not a good store of value long term as an investment or savings. I guarantee my 1 BCH will be worth orders of magnitude more than my one XMR or ETH in 10 years time purely due to the fact that there's not an infinite supply of them. A hard limit of 21 million BTC or BCH is psychologically much harder to remove and wouldn't gain acceptance. Whereas Monero or Ethereum could tweak their distribution schedule in future which would be less of a big deal e.g. change the tail emission from 0.6 XMR to 1 XMR per block.

Centralised development. We only need to look at Bitcoin's centralised development by BlockStream to know it's a terrible idea. At least BCH has multiple teams working on things. Ethereum is like one team. Vitalik is king. I hope he or his family are never corrupted or held hostage by the powers that be or Putin to do their bidding."
"Don't worry.

Huh? Zero conf works just fine. If you run a business or service, you can authorize a transaction at zero confirmations.... I pay people that have a script that basically auto sends me what I need after I pay right away, it doesn't wait for confirmations.

Oh lol
According to Core, BCH can easily be spammed. That was why the 1 MB cap was introduced in the first place. (I think miners will demand a minimum tx fee if that becomes a problem, though) 
Yes. First and foremost from social engineering vector. The more Bitcoin Cash is attacked, the stronger it becomes. Anti-fragility
it's super cool for a public computer, i don't think id' treat it like money, for that I have bitcoin cash
Please. If you've read the whitepaper you read about bitcoin cash. Look up how open source project forks work, they aren't scary. Bitcoin cash is like 9 years old, it's what's in the whitepaper, it's probably what you invested in. Don't be fooled, go do the research yourself. 
"**Tax incidence**

In economics, tax incidence or tax burden is the analysis of the effect of a particular tax on the distribution of economic welfare. The introduction of a tax drives a wedge between the price consumers pay and the price producers receive for a product, which typically imposes an economic burden on both producers and consumers. The concept was brought to attention by the French Physiocrats, in particular François Quesnay, who argued that the incidence of all taxation falls ultimately on landowners and is at the expense of land rent. Tax incidence is said to ""fall"" upon the group that ultimately bears the burden of, or ultimately has to pay, the tax.

I look at BCH through the perspectove of an aberage person who is new to cryptos. Do you really think the mass of people will read whitepaper and cares aboout? When it comes to mass adoption, media and brand is king. And BCH has this brand confusion, is ranked on #3, price is far lower than BTC etc..you cant sell this altcoin to the masses at this time... cant predict the future but as for now i cant see BCH going elswhere..

"no this is a real problem no one in bitcoin has ever addressed.

bitcoin doesn't fit with any of our GAAP which allows us to invent money.  This expansion of the credit is what allowed the world to so rapidly produce in the past 100 years and poses a threat to our standard of living in a continuing society.

Imagine being bound to the money of a previous era.  This is a question I haven't really figured out in terms of wealth/economy and production.  I don;t think credit is a bad thing and is a very useful contrivance that allows us to reach out and pursue greater glory."

And lacks immutability. VISA can do even more and lacks immutability even further
"Gold isn’t scarce. We find more every day.

Neo lacks of network effect just like any other shitcoins. 
"Because dogecoin posed very little in terms of upgrading anything, and was widely used across the internet for tipping worthy content.

This tip bot is very reminiscent of the ol' doge that's now dead.

If you recall seeing all the doge buttons long ago, it was on tons of sites, typically next to the Facebook and Twitter share buttons."
"K. 
I guess you’re out of the loop. "
Tipping has a long history
"hahahahahahhaha. another post-2016 adoption hyperman

yeah. i guess he thought dogecoin invented tipping.. 

let me be the first to point out there is also tipping on twitter too. 

ohh. and people used to include a different wallet address on all their content, people would actually send small dust/microtransactions, and the video maker would know what the community wanted more of. "
You're generalizing too much.
"Let's be honest and a little more wholesome...without post-2016 adoptees, there wouldn't be half the community there is today...we're where we are because people are still looking to get in.

Yes
"no one around here is a producer that is contributing anything.

None of these post 2016 adopters care about hearing about the past, studying the fundamentals, or learning the technology.

"> before investing in it

*before speculating with it. And they get burned, such is life"
"I think your logic makes sense here. 
I also think that logic has no place in crypto land. "
Neo does 1000 tx per second. 
In de first two years, when BTC was supercheap and very easy to mine, I can imagine flooding the blockchain with 32 MB blocks (even when every tx was paid for) could have created a problem for other mining nodes. Mining isn't easy anymore, so the risk has been reduced very much. 
"litecoin is a joke for too many reasons to mention.

Do you really not underanstad how open source projects work? Bitcoin cash is nearly 9 years old now..."
"Because of the network design. Visa doesn't have to tell 100k people you bought a donut. Bitcoin is not a payments network. Sending bitcoin is more like a wire transfer than a retail payment.

Even a 100gb block won't change that, in fact it will make it worse."
Yep that too. Any homeowner insurance covers robberies of cash and items but not cryptos. Cryptos are great for dark market stuff and where you want to be anonymous. Other than that you lose tons of protection.
"Spam transactions don't exist. Bitcoin Cash/Segwit transaction should be:

* Valid

"*niiice..*

make sure you make a good backup of that seed so you don't lost it. I hear hamer stamp with metal alloy sheet works nice and cheap "
I use Jaxx and really like it but I hear they won't give you new coins during a fork so keep that in mind.
"Gold has utility. It's an industrial base metal, and used extensively in jewelry.

It was also used as a medium of exchange, especially in the past. It has the characteristics of money, especially when it was in coin form (standard weight and purity). There was no cap on gold transactions - it could be used freely.

I'm not denying that a portion (possibly a large portion) of gold is speculation. But Bitcoin being 'digital gold' is inaccurate. Good luck integrating your digital gold into your silicon microchip to enhance it's electrical properties. Good luck limiting global gold transactions to 3-7 tx per second."
"Consider the following:

Money as a tool for storing and transferring value can be compared to a bucket for storing and transferring water. Fiat, supposedly a good ""medium of exchange,"" is like a bucket that's easy to pour without spilling but that has a hole in the bottom, allowing water to leak out over time (inflation). Gold, supposedly a good ""store of value,"" is like a bucket that doesn't leak, but that's heavy and hard to pour without spilling (high transaction costs). But ""store of value"" and ""medium of exchange"" aren't really separate functions. The point of storing value is to eventually access it via a subsequent *exchange*. A bucket that didn't leak, but that spilled 95% of its water every time you tried to pour it would be essentially useless. And a medium of exchange wouldn't work if it couldn't do at least a reasonable job of storing its value between exchanges. It'd be like a bucket with no bottom (or a currency in hyperinflation). But the ideal monetary ""bucket,"" the one we should expect to ultimately outcompete all the others, is one that doesn't leak *or* spill. That's the potential that cryptocurrency offers. And that's why any crypto that sets out to be a high-friction ""digital gold"" will end up instead as ""digital lead."""
Gold is worse form of sound money. It's badly portable, so it hardly used anywhere. Bitcoin Cash is perfectly portable. Also, there's no global ledger of gold txs, which crypto offers. It's a huge difference

absolute junk. a steady state currency is what is needed. 
its decent also to pay for things at a better ease if you have everything set up although the fees kind of killed that.,
"Why does you mean gigantic wealth inequality and major violence?

I think you are joking. But for others that don't get this: if you can't actually spend it, it has no value (other than pure speculation). It thus cannot be a store of value if it has no utility.
"Don't worry. /r/bitcoin and whatever BTC has become has forgotten that most of the original supporters are now here. We are the ones who carry the torch of Satoshi with Bitcoin Cash.

It isn't confusing. The banker interests that we always thought would come arrived, and successfully hijacked the original brand and mutated the original codebase.

Who cares, the name might have changed a little bit, but the ideology has not. Cash will be associated with Bitcoin's original vision, BTC with slowness, high fees, and failure to connect to anyone but the incumbent banksters behind its takeover.

Yeah, the entire selling point of businesses accepting BTC(actually accepting it to their wallet, not sending to Bitpay/processors) was that they would save money by not needing processors/visa/mastercard(which takes 3% or a less)
This has been on my mind for a while, also making me pretty unhappy about the crypto community. BCH will inevitably prevail.

Now think about that for a moment. If some dude is able to attack Bitcoin, then Bitcoin Cash is one big step closer to being mainstream than Bitcoin."
Everything in my shop is still 10% off if payed with any crypto. But that being said no one pays anymore in BTC because of the fees.
"Please don't downvote, but I really like LTC for small transactions between exchanges.  It's fast, it's 2.5 minutes block time, compared to BTC/BCC block time of 10 minutes.  Fees are low too.

Please don't laugh, but I think DOGE is 1 minute. So fast, much wow.

I always wondered if there could be some ""hybrid"" system for a coin.

* Every 1 minute do 1MB blocks 
* every 2.5 Minutes do 2MB blocks 
* every 10 minutes do ""big block"" up to say 8 MB
* every 2 hours do ""mega blocks"" up to 64 MB 
* every 24 hours do a ""super mega block"", up to 512MB

Each block would have it's own difficultly (and possibly, reward system).  If you put a high fee, you get 1 Minute.  If you don't care, put zero fee and get it's likely it'll just cleared within a day.

"Yup. I believe that bitcoin segwit is a zombie. The base of anything's value is the ability to freely spend it for (or use it as) useful goods or services. That's gone for BCSW, so it is now only a speculation bubble.

Its only chance for success is backing from major financial institutions and/or governments - which is, however, a real thing. And that makes it just another fiat currency."
Noob here. Any coinbase-easy ways to buy some bcc?
The fees are still less, in fact 0, for the merchant since the consumer pays the fees. So that should still apply!
This is why I began using Bitcoin and, eventually quit using it for payments.
"That's not true. You can still get a discount at places like this:

"They're called use cases when it's related to software; when you design a program you're initially supposed to create a scatterplot of all of the ways people could use it in order to improve their lives.   It's one of the easiest ways to determine if a program is destined for success or not.

Bitcoin Legacy has very little few use cases, if you map it out like this.  Name recognition and long-term viability is one of the only appeals it has at this point, from a market perspective."
I remember that as if it was earlier this year.
Fees on BTC are an unstoppable craziness. I hope that with BCC we’ll restore that spirit. What about BTX?
the majority of the people wont read the bitcoin whitepaper before investing in it. The same thing with stocks... Information is provided by media and what your friends talk about.
This is exactly how I got started using Bitcoin, back in 2014. And I used it for transactions, NOT hodling.
"Back in my day people were giving discounts for using cash for purchases because the hassle of bartering with chickens was a real pain.
"
Haven't seen any places around me that accepts it yet
Except you can’t buy anything with BCH.
I used to buy vape juice from an online store that gave a reddit AND bitcoin discount. Happy days. It's shut down now though due to the ridiculous EU regulations
Wow many thanks for all you people who have not forgotten what bitcoin had offered to us and how it supposed to work!!! This is big for those who feel alienated hearing over and over current new narrative which discards fundamental principles that were so important back then. 
Lol ok.  Good one. Apparently it’s true. I sent 10,000 usd worth of bch to exchange yesterday for 4.2 cents!  And it got there in like 5 minutes with 3 confirmations. 
FIRST BITCOIN IS NOT FOR TRANSACTIONS  ITS A STORE OF VALUE OK??????? 
Litecoin and many other cryptos have provided the same thing for years.  Bitcoin cash is simply a cash grab that largely exploits newbies.

"I'm sure I'll get downvoted but I actually think the spirit of Bitcoin is alive and well with Decred.  The community is small but awesome, amazing devs, and truly decentralized with the voting and hybrid PoW/PoS.

In my mind BTC is CoreNaziCoin, BCH is Minercoin, and DCR is a reboot new and improved Bitcoin 2.0."
It's going to be easy to add payment systems on top of digital gold. This whole thread is full of people who don't get bitcoin, and never did. Bitcoin has never been a particularly good payment network. It's not a competitor to credit cards, it's a competitor to the dollar.
Yah but 9 years later and nothing tangibly done to address this issue. We have things in the pipeline like LN but this seems hopelessly delayed and complex. 
No. Merchants bound to liquidate their bitcoins in dollars. For taxation (till it exists) and other purposes. At least partially liquidate
"That's how it should work. Miners take high-fee transactions immediately, will fill their blocks (to whatever size fits for them) with low- and no-fee transactions, because being able to transfer funds cheaply makes bitcoin more useful and therefore more valuable.

If miners consider mining double-spends to be an attack on bitcoin - which it is - and always respond by mining the original version in an orphaning block, then zero-confs become secure enough for daily use, once a few major pools reflect the transaction back to you. This should take about the same time as PayPass and PayWave.

One thing that would be useful is an unforgable double spend notification - something that can't be created without having access to both transactions, but doesn't allow a miner who receives it to decipher and mine the conflicting transaction. Of course, wanting something does not make it possible, or I could fly...."
there are other great cryptos out there. I don't think litecoin falls into that because I've seen charlie in action for the past like 5 years and I think he's just in it to get rich and screw over other and he's kinda anti-intelleculal like. But I mean why litecoin? Either go with bitcoin or just move past it to something with real innovation. In mu opinion
Having been here since January 2012, I never thought I would see the day when people would say “bitcoin is not for transactions”. I’m so confused right now by all of this.
"> Please don't laugh

Ofc, we will. Bitcoin Cash is the best sound money - much more energy was burned to secure the ledger

> some ""hybrid"" system for a coin

Already plenty of those exist. All lack scale and immutability"
And transfers to the merchant an output that’s now going to be expensive for *them* to spend...
There already is a hybrid system developing with different cryptos filling different niches.

what are you talking about? Bitcoin cash fixes this and woks fine!@ give it a reseach
No less than three years ago people were begging merchants to start accepting Bitcoin. Those merchants have since been all but priced out of using it.
you really did, it just happened that I submitted this post before going back and posting the same thing to you. 
"I believe they can't charge more for credit, but can offer discounts for other methods.

But I faintly recall reading a story saying that these contracts had been overturned by the courts. "
More accurately, both parties pay the fee.  The sender pays, obviously.  But the receiver pays later when he redeems the UTXO. (It will cost a merchant more to make a large payment to a supplier if he has to use many small customer receipts.)
thats a pretty cool thought..
"And that makes it better because it's like a surpise tax they didn't now about?

the fee was like 2-3 cents at the point in time referenced in the OP"
wow thanks, I suppose I'll have to tip it out
"Funny. I was actually just about to make a similar post. I bought my first BTC in 2013 and everyone on /r/Bitcoin was saying ""spend and reload, spend and reload!"" So I was doing my best to use Gyft everywhere I could and remember I was paying my cable/internet with BTC because Dish accepted it. 

Those were like huge deals back then. Everyone would get hyped when a new big company began accepting BTC. 

Now it's like ""it's not made for that.""

What!?  Isn't that how it got so popular? Overstock starts accepting it and it gets some recognition in the media. Other companies follow. Everyone on the sub is ""spend and reload!"" And now that that's not efficient the new mantra is ""it was never meant for that.""

Lol. Bullshit.

"
Aren't most major vendors contractually obligated by their merchant agreements with visa/mc/amex to not to offer discounts to people who pay with other methods? I thought that was why relatively few places gave any kind of discount for paying in cash, even though that technically saves them the swipe fee.

No, the recipient receives an output that now costs significant money to spend. That's why a platform like localbitcoins.com started to charge users for deposits, as many (small) deposits cost them a lot to spend. 
Yep. This is no longer the case. Now it's only about digital gold, which you horde only, is expensive to move and not useful for day to day purchases. 
get a wallet on your cell phone, transfer your coins there (if you have cb it'd be cheaper to send eth) and send to shapeshift or many wallets now are multi coin and let you change inside the wallet
Also glossing over the MAJOR fact that you can lose everything if you misplace your private key and there's no way to have a bank help you get it back like in the case of theft/hacks and so on. Let's be honest this is one of the major holdbacks of ALL cryptos and why they won't get major adoption. 
"And with all other altcoins (ethereum, iota...)

Bitcoin has become just a petty speculative money-making machine. BCH is saving BTC.

They are so full of sh*t and it's so obvious."
"Whichever party pays the fee, a high fee makes the transaction less likely to happen, which hurts business and hurts the consumer. It is lose-lose no matter how you slice it. 

Let's break it down it by cases:

- **Merchant pays the tx fee and takes the loss:** Consumers are happy on the short term because the price  doesn't increase for them, merchant is sad. In the long term the customer is also sad because there will eventually be fewer merchants to choose from as some go out of business due to the higher fees (or just stop accepting Bitcoin). Lose-lose.

- **Merchant pays the tx fee but passes the loss onto the consumer by raising the sticker price of the product:** Consumers sad. Merchants sad because fewer consumers will buy due to higher price. Lose-lose.

- **Customer pays the fee:** Consumers sad. Merchants sad because fewer comsumers. Lose-lose. "

The entire point of BCH is to go against BTC, if it wasn't, we'd all be trumpeting the even lower fees/transaction times of ETH and about a dozen other crypto currencies.
I don't believe bch will ever be worth more, but i believe bch will be used far more for actual transactions, and btc will mostly be for big money. 
Always see both sides. - however i'd suggest you go to /r/cryptocurrency or somewhere more neutral than /r/bitcoin which is censored out the wazoo
both concerns are wildly overblown. If you think for example that ethereum will have 200 million ether on its chain in our lifetime then you're misinformed

You do realize that BCH is a continuation of the original Bitcoin blockchain, right? The BCH chain has been around longer than Litecoin. 
"Being a forked branch gave BCH a distinct advantage. You wont be able to beat BTC in a fair fight even if you coin is insanely superior. As long as BCH holds value there will be a downward force on BTC indefinitly. The trolls and HODLers are going to slowly realize that BTC is going to have to work two or three times harder to go up anymore and if anyone even farts a tiny bit of FUD the coin will free fall much farther.

LTC is just another coin in a sea of coins."
Wrong. Dash beats all. 1.2 sec on chain confirmation using the masternodes.  But bch is faster than many.
BCH won't get anywhere if it relies on 0-conf security. Good luck though!

Great post. This is how I see it too. But I should say I am puzzled that legacy bitcoin is still were it is.
I spent less than 5$ to send alot of btc around last night. 
Why cares what a random guy says?
Leaders are why they simultaneously prop up Greg and Adam while tearing down Roger and Jihan. The big blockists are the true leaders of Satoshi's original vision. 
Only reason LTC hasn't taken over BTC is because they chose not to aim high enough.
"It should
Be and has led btc in every way except hot ponzi money"
"This is true in itself (for now; later BCH fees will be ~$0.00), but that isn't all merchants look for. They also care heavily about how many people already hold a currency so that they can smoothly pay with it. BTC and BCH are miles ahead of any altcoin there, and of course BTC is now unusable for small retail payments so that just leaves BCH.

The network effect of the ledger is a real bitch for altcoins."
"Bitcoin Cash 0-conf instant transactions are the fastest over the counter trade short of a customer with exact change. While blockstream/core would have you believe BCH is an altcoin like Litecoin, the inconvenient truth is that Bitcoin Cash has more of a right to the brand Bitcoin than even Bitcoin or any altcoin.

The other inconvenient truth is that as Bitcoin Cash enjoys such great utility as electronic cash, it is superior to Bitcoin as a store of value also. 

There is no market for a crippled Bitcoin and this blockstream/core's blunders have made Bitcoin irrelevant. "
"No one needs 1 min blocks. 

0-conf is much better. Nearly instant and secure enough with proper double spend detection.

In brick&mortar shops, vending machines etc. you don't have time to wait for 1 minute. When buying some more expensive stuff online payment can be accepted instantly and ~10 min conf time is not an issue. (order can be simply cancelled and the customer notified if tx isn't later included in a block.) It's not like products are sent in 10min from the arrival of the order."
"Bitcoin Cash will work across all use cases.  People aren't going to want to think about which crypto they need to buy for what purpose it's confusing and a hassle.

O, I'm going to the grocery store today to buy bread I need to buy some carbohydrate coin."
Lol. So it's a convoluted ploy to effectively lower the emission cap for faster deflationary and moar gainz!
Yum 🤣
I call it magic value.
Because bitcoin core continues to increase in value more than LTC? Until it doesn’t. 
"Litecoin is a cheap knockoff that, despite being around for many years, has found no real growth or adoption. 

Bitcoin cash is bitcoin, same user base, same history.  It has greater throughput capacity than any other coin that I know of."
"It's inside all of us? 

I just pictured all the ""Trolls"" singing: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWgTqLCLE8k"
This argument was made long before cross-chain atomic swaps were conceived of. Litecoin was the original alt-coin offering little of any real value except to pumpers who felt they had missed out on getting into Bitcoin early. The silver/gold argument was their rational for why there was any point in Litecoin at all (transaction capacity wasn’t an issue back then because every sensible person expected Bitcoin’s blocksize to increase when the time came).

1/10th of a cent works on LTC?
"If I'm correct, the whole thing with atomic swaps is they happen off-chain, thus no tx fees. See here: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=cBVcgzEuJ7Q

Also, using the LN and the side channels, theoretically the interchangeability between BTC & LTC may give us two chains to work with (while still maintaining their own respective sovereignty of course) in terms of scaling. This is just my observation based on the facts and concept of the atomic swaps on LN. 

Would love to have someone who works directly with LN or is more familiar with all this provide input.

"Haha, well, ""there is silver because there is silver"" is a wrong interpretation of what I said - and you know this ;) Try this one: Just because we live on a planet that happens to have different type of metals, and a rare one is gold, and a less rare one is silver, doesn´t mean it makes sense to make a copy paste version of the bitcoin source code with 84m ""coins"" instead of 21, these numbers have no real meaning in the first place, because it is digital and can be divided at will). 

This is totally different from the physical world, where at some point in history they had gold coins that needed to have a certain size for practical use, and because this much gold represented too much value, coins from less rare metals like silver where really useful.

"An exact statement would involve several pages of text that would be unnecessarily pedantic for this forum. 

The artificial distinction that LAMikeG makes in the image above is a string of economic buzzwords used to distract and confuse. He is asserting that Bitcoin Core is like a gold bar, the highest and best use of which is collecting dust in a vault, and that Litecoin is like currency that is backed by that gold, i.e. a more convenient medium of exchange. However, there is no bailment relationship between Bitcoin Core and Litecoin.

If he were going to assert that Bitcoin Core is like gold, then the medium-of-exchange/currency analogue would be a Lightning or Sidechain token, and not Litecoin, which used to be pitched as the 'silver' to Bitcoin's 'gold'.

Basically, his argument is gibberish."
It's technically accepted, but I don't think anyone uses it as money right now unless they're making REALLY large purchases. You'd be paying 5 bucks of fees on a $10 order.
That is much less than I have been spending and much less time for first confirmation. Are you calculating the fee yourself. If not, what washer are you using?

Yes, but it ETH is still a completely different implementation than Bitcoin as well

All others are pretty much at systemic risk in my view maybe with the exception of NEO which is a whole other beast.

Although I still hold a few others."
I think I said exactly that! I am hedged alright.
Having the option to use CT is a good thing, but you will pay for it in txn fees if you want it since your txn will be larger. Probably wouldn't choke a big vol coin, but things would get larger. And nothing any of these coins will ever be Monero level private as that's just not possible without becoming something which is pretty much Monero.
"He means Cash did have 1 min blocks during hashrate spikes EDA was inducing.

". . . you do realize Litecoin is also a fork of the original Bitcoin Core blockchain??

We're not talking about blockchain technology, we're talking about branding and marketing here. Litecoin has been out since 2011. BCH, ~3 months and already priced out of a range you would pass around full coins to demo the tech."

What is your thesis exactly?
"It's in a weird phase at the moment where it's functioning a bit like both money and gold. It's still accepted in more places than any other crypto (right?) but it's usability is dropping pretty quickly.

I wonder if real gold went through the same phase when people realised it was no longer practical to split it into 0.01g or whatever to buy a cup of medieval coffee."
Yes still expensive but not 50$ like people are saying here. 
"The first confirmation took less than 5 minutes. The second a bit longer
"
it's a bit different than most coins as you can buy it at coinbase
In a world where BCH don't exist, it wouldn't be hard to compete against a chain which limits it's own utility. That's kindof the point, otherwise blockstream wouldn't be able to compete with the chain with regards to the liquid sidechains, no?
Wrong. You are confusing the difference between an over the counter trade and when the merchant can spend the income (which requires confirmations). 
Bitpay and many others have been fine using 0 conf for many years without issue.  Nothing is 100% secure, it's all about risk vs tolerance.
It doesn't rely on it. That's just one of many benefits. 
"It already has. All merchants harness the great UX 0-conf has to offer from the get-go.  0-conf is completely unaffected by confirmation delays for example, and merchants are able to get on with business without even noticing the old EDA stability issues.

Security is also excellent as a TX locks out double spend attempts from the mempool. 

0-conf is also fast (seriously fast), faster than the even the so-called lightening network which must interact over multiple hops to a recipient. 

There is a reason Bitcoin Cash is experiencing rapid merchant growth and 0-conf is a big part of that. "
0-conf payments with BTC used to be frickin' *magic*, basically 0 fee and accepted faster than you could blink. I look forward to using Bitpay like that again, but with BCH this time
lol, Poe's law at work.

Indeed, some people try to sell segwitcoin as bitcoin.  It is in a way, but both forks have valid claim to the name.  Time will tell.

"""If BCH really takes Bitcoins place then cryptocurrency will lose all credibility in my opinion.""

People who understand what's going on are already driving BCH. Miners, merchants, consumers. So you think that if the market decides it likes BCH better than BTC one day, suddenly, everything will crash and burn because Bitcoin Segwit is not still the #1 crypto? Why would you think this specifically?

https://acceptbitcoin.cash/

""everyone who got into bitcoin after the fork will be fucked over, and BCH will skyrocket and make all the people who are rich in the first place even richer. All because of 8mb...""

I don't understand what your point is here. Who is getting fucked over? The people who invest in Bitcoin without understanding the technology? Or the people who are blindly investing in BTC hoping to be millionaires one day because the value keeps going up because the value is going up? I don't really care about these people. If you are buying BTC today because you think one day you'll use it as retirement money, you're doing it wrong, buddy.

""Besides, Litecoin does all BCH does and even better... so there really was no need for BCH imo. Its just more money for Roger Ver and his shady friends""

Litecoin fails at market adoption. BCH is already dominating LTC in terms of market cap, merchant adoption and user adoption. LTC does not do what BCH does better because LTC has similar problems BTC has, they are just on a small scale so they haven't realized them yet.

Roger Ver and all his shady friends are making money? Do you have anything to contribute other than bitter anecdotes and lies? You're just here slinging mud. Sounds like you bought way into the Blockstream /r/Bitcoin propaganda campaign.

"Sort of. What most saddens me is, right now BTC is worth nothing but speculative value. But there is still time for them to be used as this settlement layer, which will in fact bring them some utility that can be priced very high for very big players.

In the end, people will have remained uneducated and still think they've been storing value all this time... 

I myself am keeping my Bitcoin, but with the full conscience it is a speculative gamble for which I am adequately hedged, and not as a store of value."
"Bitcoin is the altcoin.  Bitcoin Cash follows Satoshi's vision.   /r/bitcoin decided to get in bed with the bankers and then had the fucking nerve to ban people who expressed descent.

so your  guys did not know what is the testnet?
LTC has only one advantage over BCH but a big one - it's much faster with its 2.5 min block interval. BCH should not ignore that because being one of the slowest blockchains (along with BTC) is not smart.
Fuck Charlie Lee.

Good old Litecoin 
Yah, what an embarrassment.  I feel like Charlie Lee is positioned himself well beneath the Core dinner table just begging for a few scraps to fall his way.
Core apologist here.  The reason I'm not too concerned about the fees is that I think eventually, coins will be much more interchangeable, and will serve different functions.  Bitcoin will be a settlement layer, valued for its high security and stability, and Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, and other alts will be used for payments, when speed and cost are the biggest factors.   I think there will be further differentiation along this spectrum.

"They refuse to even think out the implications. *The best guarantee that a money will continue storing value effectively is its possession of the commercial network effect.* BTC has the commercial network effect now but is pissing it away at record speed as commerce grinds to a halt periodically with $20 fees and companies not even being able to predict whether a transaction makes business sense before they make it.

Without the commercial network effect, all BTC has is the ledger network effect - which BCH has equally  as much (and LTC doesn't, as far fewer consumers already hold LTC compared with BCH), and its inertia in standards/code and Core's social affiliations like with BitFinex. BTC's inertia and BCH's hashpower risk and new dev team risk are the only things keeping BTC afloat, and two of those are likely to be temporary while the other one (hashpower risk) is no longer an issue once the other two are resolved."
I literally just saw someone on /r/bitcoin who said that high fees make Bitcoin more valuable...

"There has always been a (weak) argument that LTC is silver to BTC’s gold. That argument was mostly touted by Litecoin enthusiasts wanting to pump their alt-coin in Bitcoin discussions, but now it seems to have been adopted by BTC fans too. 

The question is; will the analogy stick if we see mass adoption and Litecoin blocks get full as well? Nobody actually uses silver currency these days. So will we see some other alt become “copper to litecoin’s silver to bitcoin’s gold”? Will we then see yet another coin take off as “copper-plated steel to...” etc."
"A newer narrative I have spotted around /r/bitcoin, /r/litecoin , and /r/cryptocurrency is that BTC is the ""store of value"" and LTC is the ""spending money"", now made bolder by [atomic swaps between the two](https://bitcoinist.com/first-ever-cross-chain-atomic-swap-between-bitcoin-and-litecoin-has-now-taken-place/), and other SegWit coins [like Vertcoin](http://www.newsbtc.com/2017/09/21/atomic-swaps-litecoin-vertcoin-works/).

LTC and BTC share SegWit, 1mb limited chain, the same centralized Core developers, the same poor performance and the same exact problems. LTC is just BTC with Scrypt ASICs and block timings unproven at high tx volume, which I think could have issues with orphaned blocks and other propagation problems. Another soft fork soon will see through an [optional privacy feature called Confidential Transactions apparently created by Greg Maxwell and Adam Back](https://news.bitcoin.com/confidential-transactions-add-anonymity-bitcoin-litecoin/), who have proven themselves arrogant, [incompetent developers](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#4d) already with the disastrous engineering of Bitcoin, though this seems by design to offload on-chain transactions to centralized fee collectors.

There is a linkage being formed between BTC, LTC, and VTC. VTC in particular definitely has its own brigade of eager shills.

Cash must now fight all three. Viacoin could be another in the future as another SegWit coin.

Oh, why do you need Bitcoin if Litecoin does exactly what you wanted? Let me explain store of value versus medium of exchange. This is the exact reason that rich people keep all their money as gold except for what they need to spend. Wait, they don’t you say?"
They know BTC can't compete with Bitcoin Cash, so many use any other coin they can think of to say it is better than Bitcoin Cash. Some even put 'LTC' in their profiles :D
I guess that is why Charlie Lee have been such a good-good boy and blindly supported Core. They made a deal that they will brain wash people into promoting LTC as a currency when BTC gets too expensive.
Its amazing how stupid they are that they think something can be a 'store of value' without having any value.
The irony. Both sides think they are right when no one knows what's going to happen. For all we know BTC and BCH are both wasting time on the wrong solution and we will both be crying on each others shoulders when they both go to zero. 
All the while one has a parabolic price trend and the rest are a mess.

Sort of like those tulips and beanie baby things 😂

If you understood the cross-chain atomic swaps between BTC/LTC, you wouldn't be saying it's a weak argument.
The reality is that LTC is a superior currency to BCH if all you’re looking for is transaction speed and low fees
"CT is a nice tech and better on some low usage altcoin than on Bitcoin (it would simply make txns too big for Bitcoin). It will make LTC more fungible, not on level of Monero though.

"It's mainly because Litecoin has been around for years and just works. It did everything BCH is now doing, only years ago. 

More importantly, most of us bought our Litecoins at $4 or cheaper. Nobody likes to buy bitdust so unfortunately nobody is going to walk around and start handing out whole BCH coins to demo the tech. Getting 0.023 of a coin. . . just feels stupid. It ""feels"" like you're getting 2 cents of something. There's a lot of psychology to it and I'm not the first to bring this point up. Of course today Litecoin is becoming too expensive to pass around freely too. But that's really just the last 6 months.

Otherwise, just a year ago, I could easily send my buddies 2 LTC, 1 for them to keep and 1 for them to pass on if they want to teach someone else. You just can't do that with BCH. Priced out of that option from the start."
its a mixture of censorship and people who are new to cryptocurrency are used to having their savings being hard to spend/move. so they just accept it as reality.
xrp is probably a realistic store of value.. always 20c :P

Since the propagation delays for larger blocks increases significantly along with orphan rates can you explain how BCH is any different? It seems you're indirectly supporting an argument against BCH when you suggest LTC has a potential problem. Can't really have it both ways.

There should be a meme with that Ancient Aliens guy and ""Store of Value""."
"The first time I heard this argument (LTC is ""cheaper"" because it is like silver, BTC = gold), I was quite amused and thought about what kind of IQ someone needs to have to think that this is a valid argument - 90-95 would be my guess xD 

(Because the fact that there is silver is the result of the fact that we live on a planet where these metals exist, and because there is more silver than gold, silver is cheaper. It makes zero sense to copy & paste bitcoin source code, make some changes like 4x the coins and say ""hey we now invented virtual silver""). "

">There is virtue in having to pay shitloads of money to move your money, and there is virtue in waiting for a day for it to arrive? What?


Maybe in some twisted way. 

Fees are so high that many addresses are useless (moving money costs more than the address holds). This causes deflation of money...err store of value supply. Also people might be unable or unwilling (due to high fees and delays) to move their coins for selling, which reduces the sell pressure.

It's all speculative right now as it has become useless for transferring value. Maybe LN, atomic swaps etc. will change this in the future. I'm not holding my breath though."
"> How do these people manage to actually explain the contorted logic behind ""just a store of value"" for a cryptocurrency and actually still think it's sane?

Ok so its the money right, its like internet money. Its all the rage, its worth a lot and its going up in value for probably no reason. You cant spend it on normal things. Just use cash instead. Honestly if you want to go spend it you should use this other coin. Because that coin is better."
What you just said is not a joke or a theoretical question. It's a daily question they will get over and over. If Litecoin is better because it can send small amount and bit amount... why us the one that can only send big amount and cost more?
"Cognitive dissonance to avoid acknowledging they're only interested in getting rich.

A speculative bubble can't run off faith alone, hence the preponderance of buzzwords like ""price discovery"" and ""store of value"", which sound impressive but when you ask follow up questions about why those terms justify the current price point you never really get an answer.

You never heard this store of value shit until the price started going haywire and the use as actually currency started to decline (as a ratio).

It was always about how it was a revolutionary new currency. Rather than accept that something has gone badly wrong and that serious changes need to be made to reform it as a functional currency, its easier to just ret-con the story of why its valuable.

""oh, bitcoin was never meant to be a currency, other coins will do that, bitcoin will be a store of value, like gold but better!"""
"Sadly, I think your analogy has it backwards. Driving a luxury car actually provides a pleasant user experience.

Yes. They do not care that they are damaging their chain because they are trying to morph Bitcoin into a Blockstream profit-stream. The incompetent product example is literally the thing they are using to force people onto their sidechain so they can take transaction fees away of miners. Why do you think fees to miners are discounted by 75% for the signature data?
yes correct and we can’t have medium of exchange before store of value.
How about when they bought Bitcoin Cash at $300 and now have 4x their money?
Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin. You'll see.
"Bitcoin is about freedom, totally agreed.

What I meant about unity is this, as a newb, and undoubtedly as the BTC price keeps rising and making headlines, we will keep seeing more and more newbs in here, coming here to understand more about Bitcoin... and I for one expected to find constructive posts, of which there are many here, but sadly there are also many not very constructive posts also... the Bitcoin core, BTC bashing, etc is quite shocking at first, but after a while it's just downright annoying, and I am disgusted by it... 

The way I see it, first there was BTC, but then the community was split, so came the hard forks, Bitcoin Gold followed by Bitcoin cash, etc, and I believe there will continue to be more forks in the future..

So the people who created BCH branched off because of disagreements or whatever, and now there exist BTC, BCH, etc... So can't we just leave the other one be? Can't we quit the bashing and hate posts? If you're not happy with it, why not just leave, and keep the negativity out of the community? This is what I meant by the lack of unity and constant bashing the other group in the BTC community and subreddit is getting old."
Good points, fully agreed on the fact that discussions should not be censored.. 
How about when they bought bcash at 2000$ and lost their money already?
When the US economy collapses and everyone has essentially $0 life savings, I'll be sure to remember to tell them to learn to farm. I'll credit you with it.
"> whats to say the same wont happen to BCH?   Or any other alt people switch to.

Having just watched it the community is better prepared.  I'm not fully aware of them all but you can bet there are efforts underway to close vulnerabilities that were exploited which led to this situation in BTC.  Just as one small example, while the bad actors are clearly desperate to take down key personas (Satoshi, Roger, Jihan) this time a lot more people are getting their backs.

> Why not just use ETH instead?

I don't think Eth is designed to be money.  There is a different incentive structure (than Bitcoin's) for all parties involved.  Vitalik is not an economist first (Satoshi was) plus he is still too key a player.  You can make a nice money on top of Eth but it will still be subject to Eth.  (Which, all aspects considered might not be a terrible thing, probably better than debt-backed fiat, but we have more than one choice.)  I'm not trying to say anything bad about Ethereum it's outstanding and is enabling tremendous creativity in the space, it's just not exactly ideal for money.  Money, of all possible applications, really does need to be ideal.  Notice all the idealism around it.  :)
"
"> Not to break the narrative, but that's exactly why Satoshi developed Bitcoin in the first place and why Bitcoin's white paper was released 2 weeks after 2008's financial crisis exploded.

I can’t disagree with that, but at some point it was bound to outgrow the group that helped get it started.  I feel like the same group that helped launch it to the world is now holding it back by preventing the block-size from increasing so they can keep it as their play toy and continue to run full nodes from home.  Even Satoshi said that at some point it would outgrow home computers and be run by large server farms.

> Ask yourself, what is going to happen the day more countries ban exchanges and will make impossible to swap fiat for cryptos?

Their will likely be countries that do this for some time...  especially those run by a dictator, but there will always be countries that support and embrace the technology.  All it means is those countries that don’t embrace it will fall further behind.  They’ll eventually be forced to accept it as it becomes a global payment network."
"The coffee memes actually hurt the case for using bitcoin to purchase things. People that see bitcoin as ""gold"" say ""bitcoin is too important for things like coffee"" and I think it is too easy for them to make that case and convince people it has merit. So playing in to that by saying ""hey fees are too high for coffee"" doesn't help too much IMO."
Or learn to farm?
Coinbase.
"My point isn't that Bitcoin Legacy tx fees are superior, my point is that it isn't $50 anymore, or anywhere near that.

It's a completely valid that this Pump+Dump with Cash shouldn't be able to cause all these issues, and a solution should be implemented ASAP, but to say $50 tx fees prevent you from using Core (when it was only a short term issue, which has already been resolved) is just lies and propaganda.

As for $1.60 being acceptable, I know that is a high price to pay relatively. I would never argue that Legacy has better tx fees, but I will happily argue that $50 dollar fees are not the norm, and subsequently, do not make Core unusable.

I wonder how the fees/confirmation times are looking for Segwit>Segwit transactions, might try one today."
What does that have to do with centralization?
Perhaps they can force a channel to freeze without closing, now you are short funds and they have no reason to return them to you. The gov will be fine depriving you of them forever if they have only that alternative.
Thanks, but I've already got plenty. :)
So no, you don't have any evidence to validate your claim?
Thank you! :).

"> by preventing the block-size from increasing 

I'm pretty sure most early adopters agree on increasing blocksize and they perfectly know it was the original idea about scaling.

> but there will always be countries that support and embrace the technology

Eh, I disagree. The fact that the technology might work gives no incentive to governments to give up the control of it.

Bitcoin was invented as a payment medium that had to be accepted to oppose and disrupt financial regulation.

At the moment it's just a medium of transfer of fiat money (and an investment) which gives more problems to governments and central banks than benefits which is why after China, the state of Washington, the European Union is going to regulate crypto currencies.

> They’ll eventually be forced to accept it as it becomes a global payment network.

Again, it's a global payment network as long as who uses it can exchange it for fiat.

The moment this possibility is tackled (like in China) the appeal of it disappears because 99.99% of crypto users will never use cryptocurrencies as a medium of payment without the possibility of exchanging it."
"1-8 mb wont cause problems but 16-128 + will require a lot of power.

You could probably get up to 32 before its really a problem."
The first successful atomic swaps and lightning transactions are happening.  There will be no fees at the coffee store for bitcoin because they will all run their own lightning node.  Bitcoin cash has a few months of being able to brag about this before technology advances past it.  Enjoy
While everyone is squabbling about what Bitcoin is supposed to be, I just bought Björk's new album with Litecoin.
">The way I see it, first there was BTC, but then the community was split,

There's only been a split for those people who've *chosen* to split.  People who've remained impartial investment-wise and continued to hold their pre-fork bitcoins now have coins on *all* 3 forks.  Of course, those who've bought bitcoin core since the fork won't have automatically acquired coins on the other forks.  But you know, people shouldn't invest in things they don't understand, and if they're put off by dissent in the community, then we don't need their dumb money anyway, because it's the kind of money that rushes in and then rushes out all too easily.

>Bitcoin Gold followed by Bitcoin cash,

Bitcoin Cash came well before Bitcoin Gold.  And Bitcoin Gold, despite some cool features like using Vertcoin-style ASIC-resistant mining, it looks pretty much like an *actual* scamcoin, considering how the devs have allowed themselves to mine 100k coins privately before allowing for public mining.  Not to mention than there seems to be code that delivers the devs hidden fees.  But there's none of that kind of bullshit in BCH.

>So the people who created BCH branched off because of disagreements or whatever, and now there exist BTC, BCH, etc... So can't we just leave the other one be? Can't we quit the bashing and hate posts? If you're not happy with it, why not just leave, and keep the negativity out of the community?

There are a lot of people who've realised how shittily they've been treated by Theymos/Core/Blockstream/The Banksters, and how the Bitcoin name has been hijacked by them, and they're absolutely justifiably outraged by it.  Sure, it'd be nice if we could all be Zen masters about it all, but I really don't see that happening any time soon, especially with all the vitriol they're copping from the Core shills and brainwashed drones."

"Unity?  You sound like the Chinese government promoting Harmony™ in order to suppress dissent.

Fuck unity.  Bitcoin is about freedom, not towing some totalitarian line.  People are welcome to vote with their wallet for whichever branch of the Bitcoin tree they wish - or remain impartial and hold them all."
Yea, Bitcoin cash is just putting it off. In 8MB he'll be stuck to the same fees, and by that time Bitcoin will be doing thousands of transactions per second. Nothing great is born without growing pains.
Thanks for taking the time to post this and share your views to this newb. I'd tip you if I had some BCH and knew how to! 😊

So you're agreeing with me that bitcoin legacy isn't ready for mass adoption?
bitcoin is a chain of digital signatures. bitcoin segwit is not a chain of digital signatures.  miners can sign transactions for you - how convenient!
So where can I buy this coffee with my crypto? 
"One problem, most people wont know the difference between the two ""B""s

Actually they are. Even Lightning Network transactions are digital signatures, that are broadcasted when the channel settles. You need to learn more about this stuff. :)
None of coffee shops I know accepts it so just paying tab to friends with BCH for now.
I don't think anybody would argue that it IS ready to be the size of mainstream payment systems.
What are you basing that on? Are you talking about non mining nodes or mining nodes? 
"I'm an international citizen and a philosophical anarchist who really believes in the cultural value of a trade economy, like those I've seen in thriving indigenous communities. I believe in Bitcoin for its ability to empower the individual in the realm of their finances without the need for obeisance to State powers, and I like how Bitcoin can help overcome some of the barriers and limitations in trade-economy models.

Furthermore, I am skeptical of consumerism and greed and their degradation of the individual mind and greater human society. From my egalitarian ideal, there has been an obvious imposition into Bitcoin culture of the very systems Bitcoin originally sought to subvert, and this trend has gradually driven me away from the compromised Bitcoin community."
"> over a credit, debit card

These do have fees, typically in the 1.5-2.5% + loose change.

Bitcoin as an ideology was to eliminate Trustful institutions. This isn't just about replacing banks, but making a currency not need Visa style processing. Visa transactions still technically take longer than even some of the slowest BTC transactions, they are just in a sort-of escrow of Approved vs Declined.

When much of the retail world has ~3.00%-3.75% in income on goods sold, they can and do increase cost of goods to make up for this loss of revenue.

There are many ""ma and pa"" shops around where I live, and more and more are posting signs saying ""We charge X% on cards, please use cash if you can."" This is the **exact** space for crypto to be in (coffee, cookies, lunch). And BTC *used* to be more or less usable in this example, I remember a very different BTC from half a decade ago.

Sadly, BCH isn't stable enough (yet, but I have hope), BTC isn't low-fee enough (and LN builds it the opposite direction)."
It's a natural evolution of the markets. We can't foresee the future. The market determines it for us.
Still those people thinking that a Bitcoin variant can scale for coffees for everyone on Layer 1 while staying decentralized. The stupidity of (some) people is really infinite.

I don't know this for fact, but might be the exact same trick as being played on tether.to: they allow USD seemingly, but no one gets verified so no one gets to do USD.
"> But saying that tether is baked by other cryptos is more than an enormous risk.

Where'd I say that?

 Other exchanges are backed by USDT and yes that is an enormous counter party risk on their behalf.

Other crypto currencies isn't backing USDT. All I'm saying about Bitfinex's cold storage is. How is it hard to believe that Bitfinex holds at least $600 million USD to back USDT when they hold billions worth of other assets? 
"
"Like I said, that announcement is very misleading. By reading only the first half you get the picture that all your coins will be credited and in the second part they contradict themselves.

Why should this affect people who never did any lending or margin trading."
"That's slightly different, I meant cashing USDT for USD with Bitfinex (ie removing 1 USDT from circulation).

The trades you mention are on a different exchange, but don't prove that USDT can be exchanged for USD in a guaranteed 1:$1 peg, only that someone else (not Bitfinex) is stupid enough to trade your USDT for USD."
">USDT holders cannot withdraw USD anywhere else than Kraken

And Kraken doesn't redeem USDT for USD at all, they trade it, it's free floating. The only reason USDT remains on par with USD is because people are able to pull off arbitrage. If Bitfinex wasn't redeem any or sufficient amount of USDT then you'd see USDT prices collapse on Kraken USDT would no longer maintain it's fungibility. Yet it does, proving that redemption is occurring and all you're doing is spreading FUD, but that's what this sub is for then hu?"
"> So in other words, this whole house of cards is dependent on the solvency and trustworthiness of an exchange 

In regards to USD and exchanges like Polo and Bittrex that depend on it yes you're absolutely right. Bitfinex goes insolvent then so do these exchanges which is why you need to be cautious of that counter party risk.


>but is being very vague about the legitimacy of USD backed tether

How is it vague? It's clearly written in the Tether TOS that it isn't USD."
"That's not entirely true. They got cut off from sending USD internationally. They've since solved the problem by accommodating withdrawals through other fiat currencies internationally. In fact even immediately after they had lost ability to send USD abroad they remained sending USD domestically within Taiwan (where their banks were).

This is fairly viable in the market. If Bitfinex didn't maintain the ability to redeem USDT for USD then the value of USDT would free fall. Yet it's being traded free floating on Kraken and it trades on par. Furthermore Bitfinex BTC/USD price remains inline with that of Bitstamp, Kraken, Gemini, etc. This shows that arbitrage between these exchanges and Bitfinex exists not just for USDT/USD but also BTC/USD."
Then why has't the value of USDT dropped? [Why does USDT remain on a 1:1 basis with USD while being traded free floating if it isn't redeem for such value](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/#charts)? The market makes it fairly obvious that it is being redeem for USD given it's fungibility. 
"You pretty much just contradicted yourself.

>If they just created dodgy balances people would have no way to withdraw it and any scam would be super-limited as withdrawals would quickly start failing (as in MtGox).

So you're saying Bitfinex would collapse if they did this and couldn't process withdrawals?

>On top of this Bitfinex has no banking access so without tethers users can't make withdrawals anyway.

So why have't they collapsed? Withdrawing USDT doesn't do anything in and of it's self.  It's just a token it only has value and hasn't collapsed. If Bitfinex didn't redeem USDT for the value of USD then USDT prices would plummet. People would sell it but no one would be buying it for value of USD. The thing is it remains on par with USD because Bitfienx does redeem it.

Bitfinex does have banking solutions. They got cut off transferring USD internationally but they still have banking relations and fulfill international fiat currency withdrawals through currencies other than USD. It doesn't matter if they redeem it directly for USD or value equivalent in an other fiat currency as people who then withdraw with."
"Hello,

At Kraken we currently offer the USDTUSD pair.  All of our current pairs are shown at: https://www.kraken.com/help/fees

(This is in no way a position on the statements in the above thread, but rather a clarification that Kraken does currently offer USDTUSD as a currency pair available for trading.  Whether or not someone later cashes out in USD would depend on the client, the country they are in, whether they are set up to receive USD, etc.  With questions about USD support please contact support at support.kraken.com - Kraken does not offer phone support.)

Thanks to those who are using Kraken!

"USDTUSD on Kraken has a few hundred K daily volume, does not prove anything, well worth the cost of keeping the scam going. (Not to mention that since it is 0 fee, might be all wash trade, I could do 20m daily volume right now from my account)

For sure."
Like I said, it's visible in the market. For example when Bitfinex got their banking cut the prices on Bitfinex increased above market rate. This is because only way to get money out was to buy up crypto and withdraw. Then they made arbitrage possible  and Bitfinex prices fell back in line with the rest of the market. Just like how USDT prices dropped when Bitfinex got banking services cut. Then they came up with solutions to solve banking issues and arbitrage became possible and USDT then fall back in line with the market price of USD.
">little to show that anyone's actually cashing USDT out to cash

 Kraken USDT/USD has a 24h trade volume of $607,909 it's high today is $1.0025 and it's low $0.9901. So there's certainty people doing it."
"Buying a million dollars worth of  Bitcoin doesn't make Bitcoin go to $1 million. That's not how that works...
