"Makes wonder if his death was really a suicide or if it was a ""suicide"" to gain control of the propaganda and advertising machine reddit is nowadays."
Can someone explain what implications this has on causal bitcoin users like me?
how long will it be for the manipulation?
"Their masternode idea doesn't even work in theory. Only one masternode needs to log the traffic and there's no privacy anymore. There's at least 5 US TLAs that I can think of that would have the money and incentive to run master nodes and log traffic: NSA, DEA, FBI, ATF, CIA etc. That's not counting all the other TLAs around the world.

It was a blatant instamine then they never bothered to restart the coin. Now there is nothing to say they're not an elaborate ponzi. The earlies can get out while the going is good. They can let the price gradually pump up to $1000+ from dumb investors so the earlies can get out and dump their coins meanwhile the coin's value will slowly diminish afterwards. If there was no instamine I would rate Dash in the top 10 for sure. But with the instamine it's about a low 500 coin like most of the scam ICOs just out to make a quick buck.

Monero with its better privacy features _and_ fair launch is a _much_ better investment long term."
"""Monero is a much better coin."" - your point of view.. and? does that mean that Dash is a bad investment, or bad crypto? grow up man, or go play with the other kids..

""Yeah I already did my research on Dash"" - suuure.. looking at all the bullsh*t you're spreading around about Dash tells a completelly different story.."

"Say it? Why, so I can play your silly troll games? No. 

Debate or go home. "
Nope.
Should have put those nuts in escrow.
"Nobody has assumed control of bit coin besides the BCH bosses attempting to do literally that through attempting to co-opt the name and mislead the public into believe bch is bitcoin. Get that straight, first.

Bch has value, sure. Just not more than any other crypto. And it is its attempts at obfuscation and it's centralized control, reliance on a specific mining cartel and top-dog emergency algorithm adjustment ability that make it less valuable."
"I think we agree, with one exception. Bitcon never has to be a transactional currency and, in my humble opinion, never will. I see it as a backing currency that will be used to guarantee the issuance of fiats by both public and private institutions.

Some will use it for transactions and all major institutions will accept it but day-to-day business will be settled using local fiat. Because of this I believe the deflationary nature will continue to raise it's value (exchange value in fiat AND real purchasing power)."
So you will debate with me?
You can say any kind of bullshit you want but at the end of the day if you won't even debate with me then we can all see what's going on here. You're just a troll 
bitcoin core people just want to see the paper profits go up. People are going to get burned when there's a bitcoin fire and everyone rushes for the exit but can't get out. Just like the current system, the rich will be able to pay to get out while the commoner will be left holding the bag.

Are you interested in having a youtube debate with me about scaling? 
I just wanted to be sure. :) but I coulf argue that yeah, ofc it makes sense to do it in hindsight. But it could always toumble down aswell. So I dont know.
"Transaction costs should be negligible. (Not the case for Bitcoin Core)

You detract nothing from your profits if you rebuy what you spend. It's not really a complex concept."
Yes, unfortunately
"First of all, ""should"" is a matter of opinion.

Secondly, ""negligible"" =/= nothing. You're right, it's quite simple, and you're simply wrong."
And today the troll army is back full force...
Critical mass is one hell of a thing. 
That's my official response to condescending trolls.
"It's just a crazy person and a troll. I lost all respect for Jimmy Song when he interviewed Bitfinexed on YouTube.  New York times sighting that Twitter troll too sure shows real second class journalism on their behalf.

Edit: I laughed though since the day after they did that Bitfinex reopened wire transfers to individuals. It was timed so well."

That doesn't really make sense, does it? I mean you pay transaction costs to spend crypto - why pay that and detract from your profits if your intention is to hold?

"You can tell it's not true because of how the price of Tether and Bitfinex's market price relates to other exchanges indicating that arbitrage is occurring.  Sure it's possible they could be running a moderate fractional reserve on USDT and really that isn't such a big deal because every exchange's bank is running a factional reserve on their fiat. But it's evident that Bitfinex can't just print free Tether out of thin air because then they'd loose million of dollars to arbitrage so it's no ""free money"" it has a major real world cost to them."
"It is in fact YOU that works for a marketing company :P

There are few cryptos that aren't 'compromised' by the incumbents. 
It's easier to talk the way than to walk the way.
It would be a nice story to tell to your grandkids when 1 BTC is 10 million dollars: Back in the day, when BTC first reached 10 k this crazy dude...
 The narrative that bch has more utility than btc is tired, false and transparent.
$10k I could see it. That's what Mike Novogratz said it'd reach by the end of the year on Bloomberg. It doesn't matter whether or now he'd be otherwise right. A billionaire goes off and says that on a major mainstream financial news network and it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy.
">It decoupled somewhat before the arbitrage channels were cut off.

It's hard to tell just from  memory was years back. But from what I recall they started restricting arbitrage before fully cutting it off. They instated KYC to discourage withdrawals and before they cut off banking fully I believe they permitted domestic JPY withdrawals.

>The point being, if the market really thought that tethers were fake dollars it would show in the price of tethers.

Indeed. My point is the reason the market treats USDT as the value of USD is because of arbitrage that occurs. "
Actually BTC is just an implementation of the tech. People don't realise, those that implement the tech first sometimes get a network effect headstart that is near unassailable. See eBay, PayPal, Amazon, Netflix.... etc
You seem to take this particular coin very personally.
Unless other coins take privacy and fungibility seriously it will be Zcash band Monero that take the money. 
Bch. It's insanely expensive and never works right. That's as true a statement for bch as it is for btc.

"Nobody, ""in blockchain we trust"". If more people came to that realization in this and put faith in the technology of Bitcoin and it's consensus resolution mechanisms then we wouldn't have any of this debate over what is Bitcoin, worship of partisanships and so forth. Rather just an acknowledgment that Bitcoin is autonomous, that regardless of your opinions Bitcoin determines what Bitcoin is. "
Both are Bitcoin.

Ok, I swear when I was looking at my phone screen there was no dot before the 1. 
Roger and his sock puppets take Bcash very personally. I wouldn't touch it with a 10-foot pole. I prefer the real thing.
To be fair, Devs have been idolised for a while now, and not only in crypto. See early OS system designers, and game developers. 
So sad. Not. If people choose to trade the top it is their own choice and risk. It was pretty easy to see the 300 bottom last month. Anyway, I'll make sure to personally apologize to all 3 of them who lost 50% when I go to Korea this week.

"> The bitcoin protocol was not handed down by God

Of course not and it'd be stupid to say it was. I never stated that. It's just a catchy phrase. Ignore the connotation it has the despicable phrase on the USD.

>Problem is that everyone is so heavily invested that they will worsen the bitcoin protocol if it helps improve their position and therefore the vision is already lost

At the end of the day the market has a say here and the protocol is indeed being improved. "
"It's funny, or I guess, actually kinda sad. Before Core's fuck ups started getting more obvious, each new ATH in Bitcoin made me more confident; but now the higher it goes the more concerned I get about the splash resulting from the inevitable fall."
Over $9600 now
Thats the name its developers gave it. Lol. Like bitcoin gold or bitcoin diamond. Doesn't make them the real bitcoin. You'd be foolish to mistake bcash for bitcoin. 
Fuck off man.
Seriously. Where did my 20s go?
What's bcash?
You know the date, exchange, and the exact price point that I'm talking about, but instead you completely change the subject to the flippening. I really could use those numbers you calculated.
What use cases are seeking out more expensive fees and irregular confirmation times?
If BCH has no value what gave Bitcoin value before Segwit was conceived and Core assumed control?
"That's like starting /r/cats, only posting pictures of dogs, then saying, ""this is still a cat subreddit, even if we heavily favor dogs"". "
Yep and the reason why Mt Gox price was decoupled was because arbitrage was cut off. Bitfinex arbitrage exists (both on USDT/USD and on crypto). 
He said one of his balls, so he probably got away with it by eating one of his golf balls or something. 
The testicle is inside the nut sack. He doesn't need to eat the skin. And I have no idea why I made this comment

"Umm that's a little short sighted. The bitcoin protocol was not handed down by God..it was outlined by satoshi and implemented by developers. And it has a lot of shortcomings which need to be addressed. Namely, transaction speed, volume, cost and privacy.

Problem is that everyone is so heavily invested that they will worsen the bitcoin protocol if it helps improve their position and therefore the vision is already lost, and now we have a bunch of 'developers' trying to put in changes which will gain them the most financially."
"> Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Diamond. 

Pokecoin ICO confirmed."
Why is that all exchanges call it Bitcoin Cash, then?
Yeah I got something like $2 a couple years ago and now it's worth almost $66. I should probably invest some more soon
You're very emotional about it. Prefer the real thing all you want. 
Only when the price jumps up and reminds people who the real Bitcoin is. $10k is an impressive number and it's incoming.
Dude you're salty af. Don't know if thether has anything to do, but you're freaking conspiratorial and with no sense of humour. Cheer up.
">  r/btc is a bitcoin sub

In the same vein that /r/buttcoin is a bitcoin sub.  Yes, you discuss bitcoin, but only in negative light, and only if predicting its demise."
"I feel sad that core has taken so long to bring out scaling solutions like LN, saying that, I think it would have moved faster if the miners didn't block segwit for so long.

On the other hand, I feel happy that there is a free market of competing ideas and that Bitcoin cash can compete in that free market. 

I have introduced thousands of people to bitcoin at talks I give at conferances. I used to ask people  if you haven't used bitcoin before please come and see me after my talk and I will show you how to set up a wallet and I'll send you a dollar to try it out. This usually gives people the Aha moment!

 Well I can't do that anymore because the fees are 3 to 5 or even 9 dollars, so I now have to ask them to install coinomi and give me a bitcoin cash address. I am only one guy but many others will do the same with eth, bitcoin cash or litecoin. This will lead many to question why and confidence will sadly drain away from the bitcoin brand. 

I actually wish that core would have supported slightly bigger blocks and then gone for segwit and LN after that because I don't buy that bitcoin can be digital gold, why? Because cryptos that are useful and secure enough can also be digital gold. 

At the end of the day I believe blockchains have an inherent bottle neck and that projects like iota could have the potencial to fix it because there is not 1 single 10 minute heartbeat but many blocks all linking to each other. There are problems with that project too (coordinator) so let's see if that gets fixed. 

Anyway, I try not to get dogmatic and stay scientific. 

In math we trust. In fiat we throw up on.

A lot of people will be able to sell who were previously unable to.
The market will be flooded with BCH and there will be pressure to sell. 
[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/noncensored_bitcoin/comments/6ws3ix/censorship_notifier_bot_faq/) is Censorship Notifier's FAQ. Essentially this bot monitors sites like /r/bitcoin and let's people know when their posts are grey listed.

"When the first relevant comment was whitelisted, it had not yet been hit by the bot. The timeline:

mods manually approve comment 1  
comment 1 gets bot votes

And the last three parts happened in a little under three minutes. Similar comments posted around the same time as comment 1 were not approved, the commenter was a nobody, and basically it's all fishy as hell. Not gonna reproduce the analysis here since you can go read it. But this is a TLDR.

Then how did comments which were removed get voted on? When no one but the mods knew where they were?

Segwit would never have activated without the censorship and misinformation. That, alone, is justification for any level of concern that anyone here in r/btc expresses about it.

Yes, I just think everyone is overreacting in just how much of an effect any of this has on Bitcoin.
I care, it tells you a lot.
Article notwithstanding. Title contains a very misleading statement. Bad journalist, no press pass - a simple comma fixes this problem.
Thanks, I was wondering when it would actually happen. It's sort of inevitable at this stage. I don't hold too many hard feelings - I actually sympathize with my attackers quite a bit on this front - but I also feel that it's a serious problem for *all* cryptocurrency and is not addressed nearly enough.
We are only the enemy of the bankster funded groups who wish to destroy bitcoin. Small blockers are the absolute minority outside reddit.

You mistyped his name and I didn't know about Spez before. I looked at the account of Spetz and was confused why he is relevant here.
Quote from the article.   What did I miss?
It's not really increasing in supply though, as much as users will have access to it. Some users will probably sell their BCH. But new users who wanted more BCH will probably want to buy some too. Will it go up? Possibly. Will it go down? Possibly. It's always hard to tell where the market is going. I don't think it will *necessarily* plummet, as you say.
Why did the mods reveal vote counts after all this time? The bot hadn't started its activity at that point.
Now ask yourself why they were hiding the votes before they tried to sell this additional ridiculous lie.
It seems you haven't read the actual story.
"From the Article linked by OP:

Comment scores became visible 2 hours after the start of the attack."
It's still a major communication channel,  considering many of the developers are active on rbitcoin.

Well anyone that sold BCH early has hurt his bottomline...
I don't think it's btrash. Just basic supply and demand. Coinbase is huge,  so the supply is going to increase massively. 
And people who wanted to invest in bitcoin will be able to once again
A lot of people will be able to buy who were previously unable to.
I think anyone that sold early is regretting it. And could regret it if they do in the future.
You can't buy Bitcoin Cash right now unless you're already crypto-savvy. Once Coinbase opens it up, you are going to have a huge portion of people buying it, even if some of them are selling. I'm betting on a significant rise in price, not decline.

No, I am not kidding you. Bitcoin has outgrown Reddit at this point, that is what I am saying.
"Who said it was an insult? It's just plain wrong, I don't go round calling it ""bcash"" because I know it triggers you lot, if you want to call it bitcoin cash, go ahead.  Some of you seem to revel in calling it ""segwit core""', ""segwitcoin"", or whatever you want, it just makes you look bad when you complain about ""bcash"", such as how Ver reacted in the video with Bitcoin Error Log, explaining it's a ""social media attack"" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJT2CbfHTpo&feature=youtu.be&t=2615). Either the article author is a victim of the same type of brainwashing, or they're the one doing the brainwashing against bitcoin.

Here's an interesting article (Ver mentioned) on why people call it ""bcash"":

https://medium.com/@jonaldfyookball/why-some-people-call-bitcoin-cash-bcash-this-will-be-shocking-to-new-readers-956558da12fb

> Why They Are Going to All This Trouble?  
> It’s simple: They want to disassociate Bitcoin Cash from Bitcoin. They don’t want to allow Bitcoin Cash to use the Bitcoin brand name

Now change bcash to segwitcoin or whatever you want, and you have the same situation:

> Why They Are Going to All This Trouble?  
> It’s simple: They want to disassociate Bitcoin ~~Cash~~ from Bitcoin. They don’t want to allow Bitcoin ~~Cash~~ to use the Bitcoin brand name"
So? Bitcoin is way bigger then that subreddit. Entire countries don't even use Reddit.
you're arguing with nullc's many sock puppets
You ever notice how Bitcoin always in the real news, Bitcoin Cash never is? If you ever wonder why, it because it is fake, like CSW fake news site coingeek.

The core of the argument is that the post that were manipulated were post that included keywords that generally get banned by /r/bitcoin 's auto moderator. In order for these posts to not get removed a mod would have had to whitelist these posts or the poster. So the assumption is that a mod did indeed whitelist these posts in order to assist the vote manipulation as this is the simplest explanation (Occam's Razor)."

"you posted an article with an opinion about a reddit user's opinion... Half the comments in the original ""[report](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7eil12/evidence_that_the_mods_of_rbitcoin_may_have_been/ )"" are guess work at best... "
A Calvin Ayre property. No conflict of interest.
In the interest of favouring accuracy over in-group/out-group dynamics, one of the rBitcoin moderators pointed out [a central piece of that evidence is wrong](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7eil12/evidence_that_the_mods_of_rbitcoin_may_have_been/dq5xrdi/), which collapsed the case that the attack was perpetrated by rBitcoin moderators.
Anyone actually suprised? I guess now they have proof and for one incident? This and other types of manipulation has literally been the modus operandi of Blockstream for years.
A moral compass is a burden to those who have it, but to those who don't often push their actions to far.  Restraint and balance is the mark of good people.  Manipulation and deception is the mark of those who have no conscience, or if they do have a conscience choose to destroy themselves by ignoring it.
"> Facebook isn’t the only one plagued by fake news and propaganda. It’s a web-wide epidemic—and a dangerous one at that. After all, propaganda plays a vital role in politics, marketing, and even genocide.

Wow the irony is astounding.  It’s impossible to prove attack or false flag with any of the availble posts.  /r/bitcoin mods made voting temporarrily visible so the manipulation was obvious.

So the assertions in the article amount to nothing more that unfounded speculation with a political slant, aka propaganda."

Garbage. Centralised means having power of decision making for others. When you say mining is centralized in China, you show you have no fucking clue what it means as you use term centralised incorrectly. You want to say concentrated not centralised. It just shows you will lie and deceive in order to try to make miners as enemy. Fact is these Core developers and corporation Blockstream who are funded by the bankers, are the centralised group of people who now control BTC Code.
More smear and insecurity, so afraid :D
That's my thought exactly,  but it is also important to realise that rbitcoin is one of the main btc communication channels. And if people realise that they can't be trusted it's going to be pretty bad for btc.

"There was a campaign to get reddit to do something about the censorship in /r/bitcoin, as well as the brigading they have recently partaken in (which is bannable on reddit if a subreddit engages in that).

I think this is a ~~black flag~~ false flag op as a defensive measure against that -- this way /r/bitcoin can claim THEY are the victims of hacks/fraud/etc.

A genuinely curious question met with 10 downvotes. Pretty toxic culture
7 Comment karma. Did you all get the instruction to setup new accounts? Or are you new people from a cheaper troll agency? I'm guessing the second option because you don't appear to know anything.
It was not. They fixed a couple of malleability vectors, there are still plenty others.
"Only segwit transactions get the quad hashing fix, so as long as non segwit transactions are still allowed, that attack vector remains. 

A hard fork is required to fix all transactions, like what BCH did on day 1. Hard forks are the cleanest way to upgrade, and what all other cryptos do on a regular basis."
"I don't agree with a side. I just want us to be very careful with a 100/150+ Billion dollar market, that has benefitted many individuals across the glbe.

Having a few loud voices dictate MY life from their ivory towers is not what BTC means to me or why I got involved years ago. Period."
They cowed the team into agreement after deliberately ostracizing the opposition. It's blatant.
One can dream.
Anyway who cares, as its only an issue while a transaction is in the mempool...
How about we allow everyone to avoid echo chambers
"Mainly people are salty because they were tricked into segwit, which solves ~~nothing~~ not what they were promised.

Which in turn annoys them as hell when others simply cry 'segwit segwit' implying that it will fix **everything** (even death itself)."
BCH solved malleability without segwit.
Bitcoin Legacy (BTC) still has tx malleability, too. Segwit basically fixed nothing.
Everyone dislikes false advertisement. Segwit is not a panacea.
Well, is March 20th, 2011 early enough? There are a lot of people who have relevance in the community that you do not know of.
Is that supposed to be a good thing?
specifically: energy generation with the chance of near-permanent nuclear fallout.
Bcash still has malleability (of course there are multiple solutions to fix it outside segwit), but regardless , your comment is completely offtopic as we aren't discussing malleability as I have been asked to ignore lightning 
"You understand that ~93% of nodes use segwit, thus have fixed quad hashing, right?

http://luke.dashjr.org/programs/bitcoin/files/charts/services.html

So , sure , 7% have an incentive to upgrade to segwit . Great"
"Segwit only fixes quad hashing for segwit transactions, which are optional transactions therefore quad hashing is not yet fixed for BTC.

BCH fixed quad hashing for all transactions so actually fixed it."
It was fixed with the last eda-hf. :)
"Ignoring malleability fix as you requested and only discussing scalability (not capacity which segwit improves as well.) segwit fixes the problem with signatures scaling quadratically and it balances UTXO costs to make bitcoin more scalable

This in turn makes bitcoin more secure because certain attacks exploit these 2 problems. "
Yes. Proprietary code isn't an evil thing. Just worse long-term than open sourse
Since they'll be handing out for free, yes.
Anyone heavily involved in Bitcoin from it's inception can afford Ivory towers right now. That entry level will only drop in the future. Your argument extends to anyone with relevance in the community.

"Oh they know very well, they simply don't care because they also know they can get away with it.

If every company on Earth had flawless customer support, I honestly believe the term billionaire would be relinquished to the annals of history. "
"> With 100k sign ups a day, can you imagine the customer support workload? Have you tried sending a support ticket to Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter before?

There are two problems with this comment. In reverse order:

Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter are free for users, paid for by advertisers. And you can be sure they provide excellent customer service for their bigger paid customers.

Now on to the 100K number (which seems made up, but let's assume it's true).

With 100K sign-ups a day, presumably they have a LOT of new revenue. With all that revenue, they should be able to provide proportionate customer service staff. It may take some time to train people, but it takes no time to train a person to send back a brief manual reply to every inquiry.

Furthermore, it's not anybody's fault but that of Coinbase that they answer customer service requests privately to each customer. As a result they duplicate effort. If they provided proper customer service in a public forum, they would have to answer each question only once. Only very specific account-related questions, not general to many people, need to be addressed privately.

Finally, most of their customer service requests are of three types:

1. My account was suddenly disabled or suspended without warning.
2. You are suddenly without prior warning requiring me to use Auth. I don't want to use Authy.
3. My withdrawal/deposit was initiated weeks ago and still hasn't shown up.

The correct solution to these problems is not to provide customer service, but rather, to automate this type of inquiry. Simply provide the user with a menu item to initiate inquiries on these topics, and have the website software either take action (e.g., turn off Authy), or give the user back an ACCURATE status. **Providing accurate status is not hard at all -- it's just a database look-up.** It's like looking up package tracking on Fedex or UPS -- it's all automatic, and **if your package gets lost, you at least know how far it got.**"
Burden of compliance is simply shifted to their clients.
I don’t get the downvotes on this. Obviously BCH is a better choice for transactions, but if you have to transact on the core chain you should use Segwit for lower fees/added scalability.
First two, yes. But how does it improve the security of the network and make it more scalable (don't say LN)?
"This is how it works:

"> Until BCH changes the address format

Coming January 14th (if I remember correctly.)"
/r/Bch is owned by bitcoin core and has zero community and zero mods. 
There remains only one type of malleability: by the originator of the transaction.  Third party malleability has been completely fixed in BCH.
"I see my transaction history for each of those addresses. You just need to let your wallet sync, they added light sync in the newer releases which makes it a thin wallet so you see it instantly but light sync  is still in beta and disabled by default in Ether Wallet. Download the newest version and under the develop menu you can enabled light sync. I've been using it works mostly fine despite being a beta mode. For sure it's still not as use friendly as say using Electrum on BTC/BCH/LTC. The Ether wallet Ledger's hardware wallets seems user friendly though. 

"
"core is just a very good and secure full node, everyone is free to fork one and make it better. as to scaling, watch the talk by andreas antonopolous, on chain scaling is simply not an option if you want bitcoin to grow. you reallt want micropayments from now on the chain in a 1000 years? it's ridiculous. user consensus is what stopped s2x, not any core conspiracy.

as to mining: many new mining companies are entering the market 2018 (gmo from japan for instance), so bitmain monopoly will be broken and mining again more decentralized. no problem there.

i actually think bcash was created as a strategic move by bitmain to hedge against the breaking if their monopoly. after all they've invested millions in their equipment."
"If you're using too old of a version then you're on the dead blockchain. About a month back the hard forked so you need to update your wallet for it to work.

I notice sometimes the fast sync gives me issues where it refuses to sync (like it takes more than just a minute or two). To solves the problem I just disable fast sync and then reenable it and it works. "
Ah OK I'll try that, I'm not using the newest version of the wallet.
I'm using the version that was compatible with the hard fork, but didn't update since then...
"Block size increases may not be a complete solution, but that's not the only way to do on-chain scaling.  Sharding, root pruning, 0-conf transactions, and graphene/block compression are some options that could also be explored.  And in any case, just because some solution won't get us to Visa-level transactions all by itself doesn't mean it should be categorically ruled out as a near-term solution.  The whole argument against big blocks is totally illogical--who cares if it's not the be-all end-all, it would help NOW, when the network is already congested, expensive, and unreliable.  Honestly I didn't even start to take sides in this debate until I started seeing $10-$20 fees and multi-day wait times to exchange BTC, that shit's brutal when you're a small-potatoes investor like me. I dumped my BTC before the last dip below $6000 when BCH spiked, and was going to buy back in until I saw the fees and the mempool.  After weeks of that nonsense, I did the research on SegWit and LN, the only scaling options BTC has left, and I don't like the security risks they introduce...so the only thing left with the Bitcoin name I care about right now is Bitcoin Cash.  But if Core/legacy Bitcoin ever gets LN up and running and manages to get wide deployment without major security snafus, and the fees and confirmation times go back to something reasonable, I'll be back.  

As for ""user consensus"", there is currently no good way to measure it in Bitcoin.  What are you going by, forum posts?  Bots and sock puppets are everywhere.  The hard fork should have been allowed to happen so that full nodes can demonstrate their choice; without that, anyone who mentions ""lack of consensus"" is talking out their ass.  Maybe if Bitcoin had decentralized governance like Dash and Decred, talking about user consensus would be meaningful, but the only way to vote in BTC is with hash power...i.e. only the miners get a meaningful voice.  Without a voting mechanism for users, our voices are just noise.  And seeing as how plenty of miners mine both BTC and BCH, I'd say consensus is far from complete or sufficient to judge community sentiment on block size."
Not really, despite what Core wants you to think miners determine consensus. Blockstream can't implement any type of fork hard or soft absente support of the majority of hashrate. 
"> which would require BCH price to surpasses the BTC price

No. Just upward trend for BCH and downward trend for BTC is enough to trigger the spiral. Low enough hashrate for BTC - too high fees, unusability and panic

> The point reason why 2/3rd mined BCH a while back was because of EDAs being manipulated

No, EDA stopped the spiral. Bitcoin Cash had rally up in price and billions of volume that day, BTC price was slowly decreasing. Surpassed BTC even in volume

> will never happen again

We shall see. ""Never"" in the crypto is ridiculous word"
"Bitcoin is a registered trademark in many jurisdictions. Marks Karpeles owned it in the US back in 2012 when MtGox was still a thing. No idea who owns it now. Someone is squatting it in Russia to prevent ""patent/trademark trolls""."
Tell that to the market... 
LTC doesn't. 
"> i would lose out on the equal amount of BCH and its lost forever?

No. To have your coins on both chains u've to control the private keys. What happens to a node is irrelevant

> Or would an exchange recognize it if i sent 

Too little information to give u an answer. Contact support"
That only would happen if the majority of the network/market got behind BitcoinXT though. It didn't, perhaps the censorship of various forums is responsible for this and that's unfortunate. But at the end of the day anyone can use any software they want if they don't then it either doesn't fork or it's a minority fork. If Bitcoin doesn't gain consensus that it doesn't have larger blocks then it doesn't have it, that's just the way this system works. 
No, you're lying.
"Way too many people don't know what has been going on, they're buying the price increase, not Bitcoin itself; the bubble will pop sooner or later."
Yes. It does: less energy is being burned and burned in total to secure the ledger. It also adopted Segwit which complicates future PoW scaling
"> As long as a Bitcoin client contacts a peer to peer network and updates a global ledger of where funds are allocated, it's still ""Bitcoin"".

So you don't see the combo of SegWit and LN payment channels as violating that?  With LN it's not necessary, technically, to close the channel as long as the earliest timelock is set sufficiently far in the future.  LN channels are essentially secured with the ""threat"" of settlement, there's no hashpower or PoW preventing you from double-spending as long as the channel remains open.  To me that seems like a fundamental protocol change, as different from the original bitcoin as http is from ftp.  

Just because BTC has a higher marketcap and more hashpower than BCH doesn't make it any less of a departure from the original Bitcoin design.  You know, the design where all transactions are on a distributed public ledger and secured by miners performing PoW?  Taking transactions off the ledger and changing how they are secured is a pretty fundamental change, don't you think?  

The fact that it could be done without a hard fork is somewhat immaterial, BTW--SegWit only works without a hard fork because pre-SegWit addresses treat SegWit transactions as having no signature data, basically like unaddressed checks.  The soft fork ""works"", but opens up a whole new security vulnerability.  A hard fork would have been safer, and the fact that lack of consensus is the reason Core opted for a soft fork should tell you something.  As should the low adoption rate."
"It's not unresolved, it is resolved two chains is the resolution. This was a hard fork not a soft fork.


The only reason most   miners ever used BCH was due to when it was subsidized by inflation from EDAs. Now those are gone so it can't even manage to gain more than 20% of the hashrate it would appear. "
"You can ignore that if you send funds direct to the address it works without a contract. 

I think message  that just refers to incoming unconfirmed transactions or probably transactions owed to you by contracts.

 I've used Ether wallet a million times I've seen that message but never once created a contract and it works smoothly."
What I'm missing is the history of my transactions, maybe I wasn't clear in my comments...
"> there's no hashpower or PoW preventing you from double-spending as long as the channel remains open

I don't think that's true; could you explain what you mean how a double-spend could happen with an open Lightning Channel? When a channel is opened, that transaction is added to the blockchain, so whatever inputs I put into the channel, I cannot double-spend elsewhere on the blockchain, since all the other nodes in the network would see those inputs as already spent to the blockchain (so all the standard hashpower/PoW would guard it). Inside the channel, funds can only be directed to one or the other of the parties in the channel. I could send funds to my channel partner, but where else could I ""double-spend"" them? If I try and re-allocate them back to myself, my trading partner would have to agree to update the state of the channel. So, there's no hashpower guarding guarding a state update of a channel, but it requires explicit agreement between the two parties.

> pre-SegWit addresses treat SegWit transactions as having no signature data, basically like unaddressed checks. The soft fork ""works"", but opens up a whole new security vulnerability.

If the majority of the network nodes (mining or non-mining; doesn't matter) agree to adhere to the Segregated Witness rules (that those funds aren't really ""unaddressed checks""), then there's no issue. If a naive client (based on old code) or an intentional attacker tries to sweep funds from a SegWit address, they would need to mine the transaction themselves (no easy feat in the first place), and if they did, that block would be immediately orphaned by the rest of the network. The attacker could continue to mine on their created block (creating a hard-fork of the blockchain at that point), but what would be the point? There would be no incentive for anyone else to join them on that fork other than those who were so opposed to Segregated Witness as a feature that they're willing to endorse the theft of other people's funds in order to show that opposition. While there does seem to be people that speak out that passionately against Segregated Witness, odds are that community would be quite small compared to the whole rest of the Bitcoin community, and that hard-forked chain would be ignored by the majority and would have no effect on the Segregated Witness funds."
"BCH won't ever gain majority hashrate unless it surpasses the profitablity of BTC which would require BCH price to surpasses the BTC price. That is very unlikely. Bitcoin only readjusting 2016 blocks is irrelevant here as long as it maintains majority hashrate and that it has and now will retain as BCH hashrate will always be low now that EDAs was replaced with DAAs. The 2016 block readjustment window I only kills off the BTC chain is the absolute majority of miners ditch it. Good luck with that. 

The point reason why 2/3rd mined BCH a while back was because of EDAs being manipulated. Those are gone so now that will never happen again. 


Also the restriction of block size makes fees more expensive on Bitcoin and miners make money off of those fees. So most miners done see that as an issue. "
I'm telling the truth and have different point of view than u do
"> it can't even manage

What? BTC is rallying up, there's no reason for miners to switch currently. If u believe that BTC price will rise indefinitely, u're fine. It's not the case"

So you get to decide what you call any particular chain?  Does that mean that people can call Bitcoin Cash bcoin if they want?  Isn't it hypocritical to say otherwise?"
Honest question, what is exactly the reason Bcash is not favored?

Does it not bother you that censorship of science and facts is the main way core tried to prove they are right?

Yeah, it's clearly bitcoin and bitcoin or bitcoin cash and legacy bitcoin.
Bitcoin Core is their actual name that they called themselves. If they don't like it then maybe they should change it?

"> someone innocuously shortened the name of Bitcoin Cash to Bcash

It isn't innocuous. Adam Back for example calls the latest fork Bitcoin Diamond, not BDiamond. Why is that? Because Core is righly afraid that Bitcoin Cash could become the official Bitcoin, and so they try to hide the fact that Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Cash share the same blockchain up to the time of the split, and so Bitcoin Cash has as much the right to be called Bitcoin as Bitcoin Core."
The opinion on BCH is that it is Bitcoin Cash's market ticker code
"Why is ""nigger"" a derogatory name for a black person? Because of the history of the name. See the linked article for the history of the name ""Bcash""."

Lol, I'll take the downvotes but it's worth yelling people to start in Eth until the Bitcoin factions sort thier shit out. The 3 main Bitcoin subs are almost unusable for people new to the space.
"> Diversification

Read the part where I said other crypto. You can diversify without holding any Bitcoin. If I thought something I held money in was going to fail I would sure as shit not hold any of my money in it.

Nice argument. This is your CEO. He acts like a child when someone fails to give him the branding of Bitcoin because he knows it is the only reason why anyone pays attention to BCash. Because it is hanging on the tailcoats of Bitcoin.

But not CSW, that guy is a fraud!
Its a fork of zcash. Not sure what all the downvotes are about, bcash actually probably will survive... sensitive bunch here.
Grandad? Is that you?
Not really, its all about the syllables. bitcoin and bcoin have 2 syllables. Bitcoin cash and bcash go from 3 to 2. Source, I am from Straya.
Bcore is even better 😁
yeah, having transactions take seconds.... so bad... lol
Except, you know, doing over half of all crypto transactions...
I understand your frustration but do you not see the hypocrisy of calling bitcoin as bitcoin core? How is it any different other than no “core” supporters asking you to stop?
I don't care what either of them are called, I like and use both, the arguments back and forth are getting annoying though. 
For any newbie here: he's referring to 'reddit enhancement suite', it lets you tag trolls so you always spot them later on, look it up.
Because almost nobody is using segwit...
And my axe
"**SERIOUSLY!**

Also Roger was not as dumb as Luke jr who put all his BTC on Mt gox."

That accusation was what pushed me over the edge.  It drives me nuts because it is 100% completely false.

Not necessarily, because the question is when and if it'll fail. I believe bitcoin core will fail too but I don't hold all my eggs in one basket (being coins outside of bitcoin core), I'm not always right.

> Nice argument.

Argument?

> He acts like a child when someone fails to give him the branding of Bitcoin .

Did you even watch the video? That kid he was talking with was acting like a tool all throughout and being intentionally fallacious in order to bait him. Exactly like you are doing in your posts right now. What do you expect?

No, it is the Bitcoin Blockchain.

You are such a bad troll, I don't know why I'm replying to you.
Yeah if his behaviour during the interview wasn't clear that last comment gave it away. If Roger can't keep his cool (btw I don't blame him I would have lost my shit trying to converse with this arsehole) be should limit interviews to those who can act with a bit of maturity. I mean that bastard accused him of using sock puppets. WTF. 
Roger was trolled, so fuck you, bcore fan
Because you're very mature right now...
What interview were you watching?
"The buffoon was that arrogant John dude, who never considered Bitcoin to be  ""peer to peer"". A stopped the video after that line, wasn't worth to watch it any further."
"I'm relative neutral and while I think the whole debate was really bad in general,  ""Bitcoin error Log"" was just a terrible opponent.   

How hard can it be not to say ""bcash"" not to mention the fact that he himself was very obssessed with bitcoin cash having word ""bitcoin"" in it's name.  "
agreed, I am mostly in BCH and ETH and I actually like bcash, its just a nickname.
Just so you know, /u/gizram84 is an anti-bch troll or shill.
ok giz84
"It is not an innocent abbreviation. You are missing the fact that ""BCash"" is a derogatory term made up by opponents of Bitcoin Cash, as Roger explains in the interview earlier on, referencing [this article](https://medium.com/@jonaldfyookball/why-some-people-call-bitcoin-cash-bcash-this-will-be-shocking-to-new-readers-956558da12fb) explaining it."
Then bankcoin is a fair nickname for legacy bitcoin
Thanks I just watched it. It seems that the interviewer doesn't respect the boundaries set by Roger which is really sad. Of course he has the right to do so, but it seems the only strategy found by bitcoiners to compete with Bitcoin cash is to change its name and disrespect its supporter. It's awful.
"Yeah - an intelligent interviewer. So refreshing.
"
Wealth is definitely not an indicator of smarts. However I think Roger was just refuting everyone's claims that he just got lucky with BTC.
trump is a wealthy man, but doesn’t make him NASA or Google calibre...

Always on your side Roger, but I do think that putting BCH above BTC on the app is premature at this time, especially with what we've seen in the attacks. Very happy with the logos, colors, and everything else. Just my two satoshis.
Also wanted to mention that when you create a wallet by importing the seed from another wallet it should share the backup status of that wallet.  For instance, when you go to create a pin it was telling me that my Bitcoin Cash wallet was not backed up.  It actually was, because i backed up the Bitcoin Legacy wallet already.  The app should know this because i imported that Bitcoin Legacy seed to create the Bitcoin Cash wallet.  Hopefully that makes sense.
Same with AUD

Never underestimate the power of stupid people in large groups.

"I got an injection in my spine today so I've got my computer chair all the way reclined almost laying flat, trying to relax.  Thanks for looking down in the video and making it feel like you're talking to me Roger!

"Roger, my biggest crypto is in BCH. But If you dont want people to call it bcash, just dont flinch or say anything, they will only call it more because they know you hate it lol.

I also dont understand whats bad about it. Im behind BCH because of the tech, because clearly BTC is terrible in its current state and honestly I think it will only get worse, BCH is really good. But i dont care if someone says bcash, I know what they are talking about, its not derogatory word and it actually sounds cool.

Also dont think you should bring up how much money you have or make. it really rubs off the wrong way, makes you sound like a douche. Not everyone can make millions a year, that doesnt make you better than others.

Thanks again though for sticking up to BCH. I like the wallet."

Dude, off topic but can you look into the bitcoin.com wallet when you have GBP set as the currency instead of the default USD. It fails to show the values.
What debate is he referring?
"Roger, you and Peter Thiel are on the top of my list of (active) heroes. I never doubted your intentions and the passion with which you do things which sometimes can be counterproductive. I hope to meet you some day.

A piece of advice - next time prepare better insults in advance for the potential opponent, trying to insult back was a fine idea, your improvised attack sucked big time.

P.S. CSW is a fraud"
You need to grow a thicker skin and stop wasting your time with people who cannot show you mutual respect. If he can't show you the respect of not calling it bcash then why are you allowing him to waste your time?
Dont even sweat it.
Roger, I really appreciate what you are trying to achieve but please don't engage with Core supporters who tell lies over and over again. Talk to those who want to listen, people who are brainwashed only waste your time.
"This ""interviewer"" made a great service for Bitcoin cash. When someone new and not totally dumb sees this, he will immediately realize what sort of character qualities these Blockstream cheerleaders have.This won't help their side."
"Dude, don't apologize for being passionate, or for putting yourself in a position where you defend a moral standpoint against religious zealots, paid trolls and all sorts of corrupt evildoers.

I can't even begin to imagine what it is to have an army of paid trolls spamming every single message of yours on social media. I think you owe an apology to yourself and you should pick your battles more wisely. If you actually put the effort in responding to every single moron who offers you a debate, you're gonna burn out way too quickly. Meanwhile antonopoulos is pussying out of every offered debate, because he can't possibly explain the 180 of his views during the years.

And besides it's not in core's best interest to advertise the video too much. It shows a passionate man arguing against a troll, and before you snapped you were actually pretty convincing. The only dumb thing you did was giving him your time."
"Glad to have you by our side in this defense against the saddening takeover of satoshi's bitcon.

That said, I do believe some of these people are a complete waste of your time to debate with. Your time is not worth the trolls, scammers, liars like this dude and people like Heart.

The Ruben Report is more of the stuff that will help drive adoption imo. 

Dont let these trolls waste your time. They are leveraging your willingness to be kind and defend your position to delay their inevitable segwitcoin bankruptcy 

"
Keep fighting the good fight Roger. Thank you so much for what you do. These handful of trolls are unimportant when it comes to the *billions* who would benefit from Bitcoin (cash). 
Roger you are a human and thanks for showing that side. Respect. 
So bcash is your product? Good to know.
Imagine if a BTC Core member had flipped out and rage quit an interview against a BCH proponent. This sub wouldnt be able to control itself. 
"I'm all for apologizing when wrong. I think it's a key sign of a person willing to improve and continuously learn and an extremely useful tool in doing so. That said, I don't think you owe that dude or anyone else an apology. Those of us on the side of openness and calm debate often let ourselves be shut down because we don't stand up to manipulation. This willingness to let them play by their own rules while we play by higher standards is why we're sometimes ""run over"" by them. They use brute force while we use nuance and reason. You weren't out of line Roger...you stood up to an intellectual bully who would not respect your boundaries and standards for reasonable conversation and you should be proud, not sorry. Just my 2 cents.﻿"
"Comment section filled with sockpuppets attacking you: **check**

I watched the last part of that video and just 2 minutes before you got angry he was baiting you with the exact kind of argument you were using when saying you could've just made more on the btc rise if you didn't sell for bch. Don't bother apologizing for more than just being a bit in the wrong yourself. That tool was 5 times more in the wrong than you were, being a hypocrite like that and being (what appeared to be intentionally) fallacious with every other thing he said."
"The mark of a good man is the ability to apologize when they make a mistake.

Good on you Roger."
"Props Roger, this was big of you. That interview really was childish and cringe-worthy - clearly another setup by a smug doofus to attack you (+ everything you represent) and make you rage quit. Similar strawmanning tactics to what Richard ""The Circus Clown"" Heart uses to pretend he's a relevant source and further delude his followers/minions/sheep to propagate social attacks."
You don't have to pay us to shill, because we believe in Bitcoin Cash and on-chain scaling.  Bitcoin has always been about on-chain scaling, just some people want everyone to forget that.
"You really need to learn to stay calm if you want to do more interviews like this. It doesn't really matter if the guy is being a douchebag. This doesn't make you look good.

You ""won"" most of the interview/discussion, but the last part kind of ruined it."

I respectfully and politely disagree with the offense taken at bcash. It is much faster and easily pronounced than Bitcoin Cash. I would not use it as an insult to anyone, it's just a fucking abbreviation. Call it BitCash maybe? Something that isn't two words.
"Bwahaha why are you apoligising?!! I would be worried if you kept your cool at all times, that would make you a robot! It is better that you are a human being like the rest of us :) It's not everyday we learn propaganda 101, this shit from Blockstream is unprecedented. We are all making mistakes, and winning because we learn from them too ;) One team, fuck ups and all, one objective: Bitcoin Cash ftw! Too easy ;)

Unnecessary apology, but credit for doing it. These people need to be purged from their perceived positions of power in the Bitcoin space. This is why I'm adamant BTC needs to die. All of these idiots who are getting rich off of a ponzi scheme need to be put in their place.
So don't call it bcash? But then he goes on to call Bitcoin, Bitcoin Core. Don't say I paid for shills and then he goes on to say the other side has done that. So the exact thing he got pissed over is ok for him to say about others but not for others to say about him.
Roger you are entitled to lose your cool once in a while.  I am fully in support of your efforts.  Do not stop bro!
Please also do an apology for the Dave Rubin interview, thanks! 
This debate format of going on someone else's show gives the host all the control.  Roger has been clear about his position for months so the host has plenty of time to prepare and steer things in their favor.  I've seen what they these hosts do, they use prompts, they use non-sequitors, there's no 3rd person to monitor things.
"Nice one Roger but you don't need to apologize to us. All the shit you get thrown at from these people is just awful. Please keep up the good work!
Let them talk, we will make the biggest Bitcoin Cash campaign. The world will know what Bitcoin cash is and who we are!"
"No need to apologize. Truthfully it made me like you more. Youre real. Passionate. And will verbally BJJ these clowns any day of the week. 

I see a lot of this as reverse psychology. I really don't care what Corey's call Bitcoin cash. To me and everyone in the community it's just Bitcoin or just Bitcoin cash.. But they can't let it go. We're living rent free in their minds. And if you believe that there's no such thing as bad press, then count this as a win. More people will look into Bitcoin cash and may wake up. There's enough info out already to show were a valid contender for the name. 

I imagine they'll pick up trying to troll you with this. Best thing to do is laugh at them and move on. We've got to pick our battles. I'm not going into churches and temples to preach my values as an agnostic. But if someone comes to me asking for my thoughts I'll take the time to share my shpiel.

Why is calling it bcash so insulting? 
"That ""interview"" of Roger was such an obvious trolling & waste of everyone's time from the get-go that it's unbelievable. Life's too short, you should have cut off from it much, much sooner in my opinion. Definitely no apologies needed."
Is that the same Roger Ver who went to assure people their funds on MtGox were actually there and safe after doing his personal audit? I don't remember how that one worked out, remind me.

You don't owe anyone an apology for expressing yourself honestly,  /u/memorydealers
"If he does not want it to be called bcash perhaps he should let up on the Bitcoin Core, CoreCoin, segwitcoin etc..


Otherwise, he is just a hypocrite."
"He just blatantly lied, *again*, in the middle of this video. He said ""someone was caught red-handed paying money to support Bitcoin Core"", but that is *exactly the opposite* of what happened.

The recent vote-bot incident that he was referring to was actually upvoting and promoting comments *in favor of BCH and AGAINST Bitcoin Core*. This is the fact of the matter. The censorship_notifier ""exposé"" regarding this incident tried to fallaciously argue that this was a false-flag campaign in an attempt to make it seem like BCH proponents were behind the attack (and note that this was thoroughly debunked, and to date no meaningful rebuttals have surfaced to the debunking in question)... but the fact of the matter is that portraying it as ""someone was caught trying to promote Bitcoin Core"" is a *false* statement, no matter which version of the story you believe.

This is **another** lie Roger has told recently. You cannot spin what he said in this video as a truthful statement, it is a blatant misrepresentation of what occurred.

/u/MemoryDealers, will you at least have the honor to correct the statement(s) you made in this video/apology? Or are you going to stick by the lie?

I humbly request that responses to this comment stay civil **and on-topic**, and that responders refrain from trying to change the subject to the moderation policies of other subreddits or ad hominem attacks against my person. I also ask that everyone please do their best to abide by reddiquette, and refrain from downvoting me simply because you disagree or dislike what I am saying. I am contributing to the discussion and very much remaining on-topic, which does not mean that you owe me any upvotes, but *does* mean that downvotes are not warranted (according to reddiquette).

Why is calling it bcash so insulting? 
Rip
More drama to put off people new to crypto. Awesome.
"These types of reactions from Bitcoin Cash proponents (not just /u/MemoryDealers) over the term ""bcash"" is really only adding fuel to the fire and the segwitcoin trolls love it. If we all believe that Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin, why does it matter if some idiots refuse to call it Bitcoin? It's actually a very juvenile tactic to just call something by an incorrect name as a weak attempt to delegitimize it, so let them continue to look like children. Between this and Craig Wright's tweet threatening to block anyone who says bcash, it's really making us all look like triggered leftists. The more they see that this bothers us, they more they will continue to call it bcash and that's exactly what we're seeing. IMO, the best way to approach it is to continue correcting them and rightfully refuse to call it bcash since that's not what its called. Treat it as if the person is calling you by the wrong name, no need to get all bitchy about it. Just kindly correct them and clarify that it's actually called Bitcoin Cash regardless if they like that or not."

It takes humility to make an open apology. Well done and kudos to you Roger !
"Not that you need it, but I bow your maturity and kindness and I fully support you in this project of free economy for EVERYBODY in the world. Showing the middle finger to those who are okay with non-first world countries not being able to use bitcoin is the least unpolite thing one can do.

$0.5 u/tippr"
Kudos Roger for stepping up and apologizing, although I don't feel you really needed to. The person you were attempting to debate is a big troll and I saw this coming, and he acted just like I imagined. I think your time is better spent debating actual people that care to make Bitcoin better from the opposing side instead of troll like him and Richard Heart for example. Anyhow, keep up the amazing work and being an advocate for Bitcoin and financial freedom, you know I support you! 
Roger that's how some of these people operate. They hounded Mike Hearn until he left. They're almost as bad as scientologists in the mind games they play. They do it just to break you and make you lose it. 
"hahaha you guys are crazy. If Bitcoin is so broken, why wouldn't he just sell it? Why wouldnt he trade it for another CC? You are being duped. Why do you even want bitcoin in the name if it is so bad?

BCash is a shitty alt-coin used to benifit this guy and made him millions. "
"FWIW thank you for standing up to this prick's insults and lies, especially the implication that people calling it bitcoin cash being only you, Jihan and ""sock puppets"".

This community has raised more than $17,000 in just about two days for the bitcoin cash fund (now more than $80,000 in two weeks). By saying there is no grass-root support for bitcoin cash, that prick insulted the whole bitcoin cash community not just you."
No need to apologise is better not to engage with trolls. Guy was an arrogant jerk and was patronising you with inane comments. 
"5 years was all it took, to turn Bitcoin from an free, open and global Internet-enabled money for everyone, into a settlement network for the rich. I understand your frustration.

They simply do not get it. A Bitcoin that is for everyone, has the potential to alter the course of human development for centuries into the future, for the betterment of all mankind, not just the already well-off in the 1st world. It has the potential over time to end the suffering of millions of people.

Yet here we are, r/bitcoin feeling smug about Roger V. giving the finger, then he feels he has to make an apology on YouTube and now we're discussing it on Reddit.

This is not what Bitcoin should be about. Sorry Roger."
No need to apologize, you've done more for btc and bch than nearly anyone else. Their little name games don't mean shit, dollars will speak louder than words.
It’s ok Rog, bcash will probably survive
The interview on The Rubin Report was great, if you're going to do interviews with YouTube personalities that's the type of interview you should do, and type of person you should be talking with..   Not antagonistic trolls.  
"Just watched the video now... it's very infuriating just to watch. You don't have to apologise to anyone for going through that... I'd love to see some proper debates happen with a decent moderator... 

anyway despite all this... i do sort of have this 'fog lifting' sort of feeling surrounding BCH and BTC. If this is the best debate the small block 'team' can put up, then I weep for them. It won't matter in a few years. We're only human, and you can tell the interviewer just has no regard for the work Roger and anyone else has done to try and help Bitcoin along. You're too kind for your own good to agree to this, just because none of the serious players will have a live debate (as I've seen hinted at around here before)

The one part I really don't like is attacking his business and saying it's not successful because it doesn't make over 1mil. I'm a self employed musician and recording engineer, I would feel very safe saying I'm good at my job, but i'll be fucked if I ever make 1 mil in a year. "
"IT's okay roger BCash is awesome. Bcash will dominate, everyone knows BCASH is superior. BCASH for the Win. 

BCASH!!!"
"You're a passionate guy dude.  You remind me of me.  That's one of the unique things about you.  Don't ever change.  Be true to yourself. As always.
"
And I apologize for passing some judgement from 1 video just minutes ago. Thanks for posting this, you're good in my book. Actual psychopaths/narcissists are incapable of apologies.
I am not Roger Ver, I am not Jihan Wu, I am not a sockpuppet, and I want Bitcoin Cash to be called Bitcoin Cash. Thank you for standing up for me and many others, including all Bitcoin Cash developers.
"Watching that turned me off even more to Bitcoin core supporters like the host (John?) in the Error Log video. 

As the saying goes, an idiot will drag you down to their level and beat you with experience. They couldn’t win otherwise if arguments were based on merit or logic.
