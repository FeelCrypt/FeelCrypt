"> Why should previously Bitcoin-friendly merchants be convinced that this time it will be any different?

They adopted Bitcoin for economic reason. The abandoned Bitcoin Core for economic reasons. They will accept Bitcoin Cash for economic reasons"
I actually don't think it's a huge deal, because new sets of merchants will have woken up to crypto in the intervening years, and since BCH is all about scaling, unlike BTC, it shouldn't be an issue. Also, if they used Bitpay or Coinbase the changeover coming will be unnoticeable. If they held their coins they're doing fine and already hold BCH anyway.
Quickly explaining how we ended up in this situation and that BCH was created specifically to solve this problem should assuage their fears.
All that matters is that it's more profitable to accept it. It was only dropped because the fees were cutting into profit margins. If they don't accept it when it's more profitable a competitor will and they will not like losing sales to them.
"'Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.'

Therefore, I don't see another coin ever limiting it's blocksize through a genuine consensus ever again in the same way BTC did. It's essentially scale or die. BTC did not scale properly, or in time, and it's damaging for crypto as a whole. Pretty much any other coin on the planet would have handled this scaling issue better, starting first with on-chain scaling and then in the face of real problems of larger blocks, considered moving to something else. It's absolutely unreal that a tiny 1MB block size wasn't even moved to 2MB and instead, a better option is to SegWit?!?!?

There's no fucking real reason for that apart from the reasons everyone here is familiar with. 1GB blocks have been tested and worked.

If someone now thinks 'right, it's time to make a decent crypto work again as a currency', the first thing is to make the blocks bigger, big enough to handle the load, and keep increasing them until other factors come into play that make the system too impractical. We're NO WAY NEAR that yet, even with 8mb, potential 32mb, and a working 1GB testnet."
Basically, but the total cost of the diamond doesn't always mean the value of the chipped part increases. It's consumer driven (supply and demand)! (If I understood what you said correctly)
U can afford to move gold, u can't afford to move BTC
As far as I know, transaction malleability is a small annoyance more than anything else. It can be fix in many ways, some super simple like ordering the different elements. By the say SegWit doesn't really fix it because you can still send old transactions format...
Not at all. Zero conf was fine until core introduced replace by fee (RBF) when the network became backlogged as a result of their decisions.
No, malleability is a non-issue. The problem is full blocks and high fees. For 0-conf you need predictable fees or else the tx may not be mined until later, allowing easy doublespends.
Wake me up next flippening.
I honestly think this is the very first instance I've seen of this behavior.

That just doesn’t make sense. Bitcoins price increase and attention over the years is due to so many people speculating and pushing for its adoption as a currency. Without that, it’s worthless. Right now bitcoins are worth a lot but that won’t be the case once an actual, functional currency comes along mainstream. Just give it some time.
"> The big investors will buy it.

why though? the only reason to buy bitcoin instead of any of the competing crypto currencies is ""just because it's bitcoin"""
No, they won’t. They’ll figure out long before you how toxic an asset bitcoin is. It’s only real value is in facilitating black market purchases. The rest is hot air. It’s functionally useless as a currency, and if it’s not a currency, it is nothing at all.
The only way that something can be a store of value, is if it has utility. Bitcoin has lost most of its utility and because of that, will no longer be a store of value.
Yes!  Like what AOL stock was like to the internet! Because big investors love wealth backed by zero utility! 
If it can't be a currency it won't be a store of wealth. 
"> Bitcoin is a worldwide distributed trustless ledger.

So is Bitcoin Cash, and hundreds of other Crypto-currencies? So why use Bitcoin over Bitcoin Cash? Only difference is Bitcoin Cash can be store of value AND currency. While Bitcoin can only be a store of value (with less use everyday)"

The Internet consists of a whole bunch of Protocols.  One of them is Bitcoin.  Others are SMTP, HTTP, HTTPS, SIP, XMPP, SOAP, WSDL... Some of those might be layers on top of other layers.  Maybe you mean TCP/IP or the Ethernet/SONET/ATM Layer 2.

Bitcoin is Peer to Peer digital cash.  What do you late to the party, know nothings not get about that?  You are trying to rewrite history with your uninformed garbage."
You can't, mostly because the complaint is quite valid. Crypto is by nature unstable and will be for quite some time. In essence, a crypto needs to prove itself before it will be accepted. No amount of technical specifications will change people's minds. Only a long, proven track record will be able to change their minds. Crypto is not mature enough for day to day transactions.

Anyone who’s ever managed a large scale system will tell you, vertical scaling is not a solution. It is a delay.

It should be marked up as a learning experience.

If you read carefully, the volatility, they refer to the fact that transaction can get confirmed fast so within the payment period the price change.  If, for instance, BitPay received the bitcoin and can accept 0-confirmation like they did before... the volatility of the company is 0... they get the amount of fiat they want. The problem is that transaction was not getting confirmed fast enought.

1. BTC currently has a limit of 7 transactions per second.  
    
2. High transaction fees due to the transaction congestion.

"Gold is always rising in price, yet there's a reason why you don't pay stuff with gold.

Image that every time you had to pay something with gold you needed to pay a third party to get the gold safely across. If that company had a limited number of trucks, then it's understandable that the price to put one gram of gold in that truck will increase the less space there is in the truck, because people who are willing to pay more will get their gold shipped first.

This is basically what happens with Bitcoin today, it's expensive to move your bitcoins around, so it's not very usable for small values like that of a game on steam, because you would end up paying more in taxes than on the game itself."
Real world usage don't set the price but they *guarantee* that there will always be a price. 
">What is the reason why the difficulty cannot be reduced to diminisg the hash power required to create transaction blocks?

That will happen, but that's not the point I'm making. I'm not suggesting that it will grind to a halt or anything, the difficulty will adjust and the blocks will keep being created at the same rate.  

The point, rather, is that the higher the hashpower, the higher the difficulty, the more 'work' is stored in the blockchain. This is what makes it resistant to attack, and therefore very reliable and trustworthy. The more work contributed, the greater the obstacle for a malicious miner to pervert the blockchain. 

Put simply, the less work put in by good miners to build the blockchain up to a point, the easier it is for a bad miner to 'overwrite' recent blocks by creating his own alternate and perfectly valid chain with more work. It's worth noting too that this doesn't necessarily need to be malicious, and the odds of even 'good' miners creating these miniforks increases as difficulty decreases and hash power fluctuates. 

If you want Bitcoin to be a store of value then, and useful in very high-value scenarios, this makes it non-viable. Now I'm not going to invest billions to create a longer competing chain so that the transaction for my coffee I just bought is cancelled, but such an action becomes more and more viable for a large corporation or government as hashpower decreases. A huge transfer of funds or even some kind of smart contract could be deliberately wiped from existence.

Even more plausible (inevitable, even) is that the number of confirmations required by any party using Bitcoin will rise and rise exponentially. This may be tolerable if you view Bitcoin as a store of value, but there is no denying that this is an objective decrease in the utility, convenience, and therefore value of Bitcoin.

>In that case couldn't bitcoin be sustained from the fees induced solely by the simple motion of wealth?

I'm not 100% sure what you're asking. If you're asking about when the block rewards stop leaving fees as the only thing incentivising miners, then that's the idea by design. 

It seems to me that an economy with many people making frequent, predictable, uniform transactions each with relatively low fees is more stable and dependable than one with very few transactions but with relatively large fees. If you're putting hundreds of millions into a mining investment, you're going to be putting them into the former where you *know* what % you'll be making, rather than the latter where sometimes you'll be eating electricity costs waiting for the times where you're raking in fees.

"Do you even need to? Here's a thought:

Using Bitpay, Steam would ""accept"" Bitcoin and have it immediately converted to filthy fiat and deposited into their account. Bitpay would take their cut. Steam had nothing invested in the effort other than as another revenue stream for USD.

Would it be possible for you to accept BCH (and perhaps other alts) and credit users' Steam accounts with the appropriate $$$? The main disadvantage would seem to be that you'd probably have to take your profits from the customer, not from Steam (though it might be worth running at 0% for a while to build confidence. If the price is on the up, customers might be more accepting of this anyway). With a browser plugin, this might even be made seamless and could then be extended to other merchants that allow gift-card style balance transfers (like Amazon).

In fact, it might be possible to take your profits from gift card style transactions. I know when you pay $25 for a $25 gift card in Walmart, damn sure Walmart is getting a cut."

As someone that's been out of the loop since 2014, could you explain it to me? My understanding was that the original intention was to have a transparent currency that wasn't backed by a single entity or even a conglomerate. I remember when Overstock began accepting Bitcoin and it was some of the biggest news at the time. If Bitcoin can't really be used for transactions what is the appeal and why is the price still going up? Seems like it is dead in the water but more in demand?
Customers pay fees to move btc to Steam. When Steam wants to move / use that money, they have to pay heavy fees (lots of inputs).
Steam needs to sell the coins once they get them.

Exact, a perfectly valid transaction should be taken as good as you don't see another transaction doing a double spend. This can be detected in a few seconds! With Bitcoin Core, you can't do anymore because that perfectly valid transaction may be dropped from the mempool and basically refunded. We didn't had any transactions dropped from the mempool before 2016-2017 really!
Of course, I add adding highlight on the other part, something that is as important. For me 0-confirmation is as important as low fee. Of course both is a killer feature. Bitcoin Cash will win, because it will have both... before LN.

It has actual worth like any currency, right? I have an object, and you have a currency. I accept your currency (bitcoin), and hence it has value. Now, there are things that make Bitcoins value go up, but nothing that gives it direct value (think of when the USD used to be backed up by gold. It's not anymore. Similarly, Bitcoin doesn't have a central bank or gold backing it up. It's worth what people think its worth, just like any currency).

Well, in the sense that people will stop buying Steam games with Bitcoin because of the fees (who the hell wants to pay $5 in fees for a Steam game? That's right, no one). So for Steam the decision was easy, drop support since the income from Bitcoin sales have plummeted to ZERO, and hence no reason to spend and resources on it. 
Did you read the article? Steam have to spend time and money processing refunds.
"Usage of the service likely declined due to fees being higher than the cost of many games or on the same order.

That, and when people DID use bitcoin to pay for stuff it would create a support headache for Steam.

So if the sales are low and when you do get a sale it costs you money (in terms of human effort) and is super inconvenient to customers.. well, then it cuts into profit margins.

it'll end up being a black hole of wealth for the majority of people hoping it'll boom forever. 
Is a Ponzi/pyramid scheme a good long term store of wealth? 
"Consider that Bitcoin is fundamentally different in that it *needs* to be used to be secure.

The fewer people using it, the fewer transactions, the fewer fees to incentivise miners, the less work contributed to the chain, the less secure it becomes. 

There is no analogous situation with gold; with gold, everyone *can* bury it or hide it in safes and it maintains its value (in fact, I'd argue that's even more secure than bringing gold out into the open to transact with).

As anyone who has ever sold anything in their life knows, quantity is better for revenue than forcing the price up. Better to have a lot of people creating transactions with relatively cheap fees than to impose artificial limits on transaction throughput to create a ""fee market"" with costs so high that people are consciously discouraged from using their currency at all for that very reason. Constant small fees are also more predictable and consistent than infrequent large ones, encouraging sound investment. 

For security it needs hash power, for hash power it needs miners, for miners it needs fees, for fees you need a lot of people willing and happy to create transactions."
Gold have real world usage backing it as a store of value. A 100% useless store of value is probably the most shitiest store of value ever. 
If you can't sell it, can you at least fill your car's tank with Bitcoin?
Is oil *only* a store of wealth? 
Oil is a product, so is gold. They all have uses beyond the value in them, what does Bitcoin offer that you can't get from anything else?
Eh? They all have problems scaling. None has scaled with any success that you might call scaling success. They are largely untested.
Fuck knows dude. I haven't bought BTC in a long time. I know i'm no great trader, I've invested in technology I have an interest in. I feel like buying BTC now is less of an investment in good technology, and more of a 'hope and pray' when it starts to come down, you can get out quick enough to have made a profit. I've gone to sleep, and woken up having missed 20% price increases in coins I was thinking about the night before, with 'I'll get some in the morning'. I wouldn't forget for a microsecond that the same thing could happen to BTC while I slept. It could cut right in half in price, coupled with all the exchanges crashing, the mempool being full... it's suicide. I have no plan to be part of that game so my cryptofolio is now not even 25% BTC. I didn't even want a portfolio when I started, I wanted to spend some fucking money on stuff I need and pay low transaction fees, and liked the idea of being my own bank. I spent 2 BTC on computer hardware in 2015 thinking 'surely it can't be more valuable than this'.... It's nice to see how it's value has gone up but there's no reason for it now that scaling has come to a standstill, merchant adoption decreases by the day, and that makes it too risky for me. I can't wait to actually use my TenX card day in day out once ETH comes out, and I would LOVE for them to support BCH next, but I'm not paying ridiculous BTC fees just to get the remaining coin to my TenX card. Convinced my lass to get a TenX card because she goes to germany and hates dealing with the EUR conversion... the fee was over a dollar to send $15 to the TenX wallet to order the card.... the first thing she did was ask me if that was correct. This was after we checked blockchain.info's suggested values for the slowest speed, and chopped it down further still using a custom fee. She won't be using it without ETH but luckily that should be coming by the end of the year. Life, man. Life.
"This is just the same tired ""Store of value"" debate.  If Steam not appecting Bitcoin anymore isn't concerning to you, then we have a major problem."
"> Vertical scaling displaces the problem, it doesn’t solve it

It would solve the problem *today* which is a good step forwards. other solutions can be worked on in the meantime.

Losing merchant adoption now because of an ideological disagreement is absurd."
So, what you are saying is we should just give up? It'll never scale so don't even try? Because I know for certain that a government backed cryptocurrency isn't what I signed up for, so if this fails then cryptocurrencies were doomed from the start. I disagree completely that it won't scale on chain, technology has gotten better and with current tech we can do 1 gigabyte blocks, so screw the people that say it isn't possible.
"Reminds me of the James Bond movie Goldfinger.

How did he want to wipe out a bunch of gold, by irradiating it making it un-spendable.

If you cannot use it, it is useless, and that makes it worthless.  What good is the protocol if you cannot do anything with it?
"Yes, what's the use of a currency that only serves to store value?. The value of a currency is determined by what it can buy, if you can't spend it it's worthless. 

That being said I have both BTC and BCH because I purchased before the split, and I'm not willing to let any of them go. But if I were to purchase one of them to use, or were to open a store that accepted it, there's really only one option."

You're right, its in a tail spin.
Are you serious?  Buy them with a credit card?  That's a thing to do but god damn son, link your bank account.  They already know where your money comes from just by using credit, except you're paying someone else to buy bitcoins for you at interest.  That makes no sense unless it's literally your only option and I'm not sure how that's possible if you have a valid credit card.

Sad. Thanks for confirming it.
Apologies, appears I was incorrect. It just wasn’t tweeted by the official account. They have however stopped accepting BTC.
Ok cool, thanks for sharing.
Yeah, and I can use seashells as money but that doesn't mean anything unless people decide to accept them as valid currency. Having these big vendors suddenly refuse to accept Bitcoin doesn't worry you at all?
More people buying into a coin that has less uses by the day. I'd say that's pretty bearish to me.
Thanks for the insight!
"Shit, the core shill army is in full downvote mode there. Hundreds of ""please accept Bitcoin Cash"" comments, downvoted to eternity.

They said, ""Bitcoin is not for small payments, do your own coin"", and when we do our own coin and ask Steam to use it for small payments, they run wild? What do they want? That nobody uses cryptocurrencies for retail payments? Is this the goal?"
I wouldn't be shocked if it wasn't trolls to be honest. It's very possible BTC is poisoning the well and broader consumers will start side-eyeing all crypto for the near future because of BTC falling down on the job.
You replied to a non-Valve account on Twitter. Use http://www.valvesoftware.com/email.php instead

Wrong coin.
8 is soft, 32 is hard limit. Both of you are correct.
As long as they could be bought *and* sold, I'd see this as a good thing.  Anything that gets people using crypto currency is a win.  The future it not likely to be 1 coin to rule them all, but hundreds of coins that do different things, bringing competition and market forces to currencies.
What the actual fuck did i just read. You did read the whitepaper that also lives in the chain right?
"Looks like it is too late for that.

edit: By the way, these guys accept Bitcoin Cash: https://www.keys4coins.com/"
"No, the problem is the cost of doing business with bitcoin amounts to a significant portion of the cost of the sales of the products.  It no longer makes financial sense for them to offer Bitcoin as a model of payment, nor will it ever again from this moment on because the fees will never go away until Bitcoin's adoption rate is so low that it is irrelevant.

You mention below that the volatility is as important.  It simply is not.  It's icing.  If the Bitcoin transaction worked instantly, which it doesn't, for the same reason that the fees are too high, Steam would have a slight annoyance converting it to their preferred currency but it would take seconds instead of sometimes hours which by then causes a definitive price fluctuation and they wouldn't be passing a fee to their customer possibly larger than the products they purchased with no real way to reconcile that."
"Volatility was never a problem when they could trust that once a transaction was seen it would be confirmed in the next block. It didn't really matter that there was a ten minute delay.

That's no longer true. That makes volatility a problem that it never was before.

Basically agreeing with you."
Yes and if you read carefully, the fees, they refer to the fact that the fees have at one point gone as high as $20, which is what I highlighted.
"I think he meant why is the price inversely proportional to how useful it actually is?

You do realize that Steam now almost qualifies as a monopolist?
"GEEE TOOO EHHH DOT COM

Hey, you should send that TIP to the guys above. I'm sure they would LOVE and treat you well."
"How were fees cutting into profit margins for the merchant when the buyer pays the fee?

This was likely done because it caused a customer service nightmare as people had their transaction stuck and complained about lack of credit hours later."
The fees are paid for by the customer, how can they possibly cut into Steams profit margin?
"> It was only dropped because the fees were cutting into profit margins. 

Not only that, but also very low volumes of transactions.

People don't buy bitcoins to spend them (what's the point of buying bitcoins to spend them in shops where you could use the credit card you used to buy Bitcoins in the first place?)."
Here's another idea, NATIONAL blockchains. Think about it. Do you really care about Chinese transactions, probably not, and they don't care about yours, either. Lets distribute the load to the servers in each country, this along with a blocksize increase, could get Bitcoin up to Visa speed with lower cost in a few weeks (!!) This ALREADY happened with the Internet. Yes, you can still .com, but you could also .US or .RU or .CN, these national addresses where an add on, THIS WAS A FORK of the INTERNET ITESELF. Maybe the BCH fork was the wrong fork (!!) Yes, you would split the mining revenue, but you could also make the mining easier mathematically, by a proportional amount, thus maintaining the pay-per-CPU-cycle. Then, if you needed to actually do an international transaction, you could do an international block transfer between the blockchains. Would that be more expensive and slower than a local trade ? Maybe, but those are a tiny share of most transactions, and the computational load between two countries would still be less than the current whole world blockchain, so it wouldn't matter 98% + of the time, and it would quickly fix a lot of bitcoin's problems, even including some subtle things, like energy use, and latency of transmissions. This would also paradoxically reduce the incentive for fraud, since you could only easily defraud your own countrymen, it would be less of a Reach our and loot some foreign other, like internet crime is now.
You're logic is misleading 
Vertical scaling displaces the problem, it doesn’t solve it. Until there’s a way to achieve horizontal scale, it will never work. The only way you achieve horizontal scale is with a regulating authority. The future of crypto is govt backed crypto, not the idealized version of it.

Financially, I could care less which one wins - I hodl both.  I fully expect both to go up quite bit in the years ahead.

Philosophically, I believe that Blockstream has caused much of this problem.  They have limited the block size and a lot of this congestion is a result.  Why?  To make a business for themselves or else some bank is pulling their strings.  It is WELL DOCUMENTED that they are a shill for big banks.  There is a huge conflict of interest there.

Great, debate away.  Want to discuss raising blocks?  Not over there.  Want to discuss LN problems?  Not over there.

Really? I didn't know Bitcoin worked with 0 fees, also the conversation was that Bitcoin was a store of value, so which is it? A currency or store of value?
You’re saying in order for something to be a currency it needs to have a store of value. I’m pointing out that our current currency is only valued by how many people trust in it. So no something doesn’t have to have physical value to be a currency, it just needs to be seen as valuable by enough people.  
So you can't explain? That's what I thought. 
">BitPay is also planning on adding additional blockchains to their repertoire. By next year, Pair says they will natively support 4-5 additional blockchains, determining which ones by their ability to enable payments and by market cap size.

This will help consumers who are moving towards other cryptocurrencies in order to avoid bitcoin’s current high transaction fees.

[From an interview with Stephen Pair of BitPay today](https://hypepotamus.com/news/bitpay-30m-series-b/)"

Steam just deadopted. Do you still think there will be more retailers?
bitcoin is just to volatile for a merchant to keep up. You'd have to adjust your prices daily because of the strong fluctuations. That could be fine if you'd sell 5 products but it's impossible for a whole library. Djeez just imagine having a restaurant and you have to print out a new menu every day.

"Having read the press release, I do see this as a very sensible decision, as disappointing as it may be. Steam users have a very high overlap with the current Bitcoin demographic, but currently the cons to accepting it outweigh the pros.

At least Steam does seem to have people on board who understand Bitcoin well enough that they will probably reconsider this decision when new scaling tools come out, or maybe another currency in the interim (perhaps Bitcoin Cash if Bitpay begins accepting it).

I see this as temporary, even though I have to admit it scares me a bit. Bitcoin has to scale. If it remains a store of value and isn't readopted by merchants when fees come down, I will consider that a failed experiment."

Thank you so much :) 
Why do you bother replying if you can't even explain like I was 16?
Thanks blockstream 
I'm guessing there needs to be a new rule added to the internet, like 42, except 'if it consumes electricity,  it will mine' 
I'm struggling to find a proper resolve to this problem, but I think it's a very important one to address. Why should previously Bitcoin-friendly merchants be convinced that this time it will be any different?
This is the real damage here. 
Nonsense, if it is faster in the future it will be adopted 
why?
Thank you, for your patience.
"We have only Core's idiocy to thank for this. Merchant adoption is dying.  With good reason too.  Bitcoin is broken and unreliable.

It's sad as fuck.

Bitcoin Cash is the only hope.
"
Exactly. This PR disaster helps the central bankers keep their fiat ponzi shell-game going a few more years.
Won't they accept it once again once Lightning is ready?
...I just bought a really nice gaming machine a few days ago, and was about to start buying steam games with bitcoin.   Oh well.  I guess I'll just use my credit card.

"Imagine you're a payment processing company, and Steam announces that it will no longer accept your payments, because they are unusable. What would that do to your stocks price?

Such news should cause a dip in BTC price, yet we don't see any. BTC is now officially not a currency or a payment system, but a speculative bubble."
"Steam was a huge step for bitcoin adoption, I remember how big the victory was when they accepted bitcoin.

Before that, all the community wanted to buy things with bitcoin, because it was magic (instant and free). The community knew that it was the utilization of a currency that explain it's value.

And now......... ""buy bitcoin, it's an investissement, we will be rich, and quickly""

Times have changed...

This news is clearly a disaster and it hurts the value of bitcoin.
"
The real problem is that the merchants turned off by this horrible devolution of BTC, don't have the patience or passion to bother a second time. It's going to take a lot of convincing to get merchants back on board with any crypto because of this.
merchants are dumping btc left and right and yet somehow magically it's still being pumped. 2+2 = fish.
I don't get it, what's going on with bitcoin?
"To add to it.

Merchants that added bitcoin as payment option saw little to no increase in sales except the first days following a news.

That's because who buys Bitcoins, doesn't do that to spend them."
That's not an explanation and BTW I prefer the pyramid scheme analogy which is more fitting with BTC.  
F*ck! We have to build the infrastructure two times! Thank you, Blockstream/Core...
"Yeah, did you read what I said?

""... That you can't get from anything else""

Other things can be made into fuels and other metals are also used in electronics and jewelry.

I hate being snippy. But honestly, learn to read before you start an argument... "
Anybody notice the sudden increase in bitcoin price coinciding with the Steam news and also a sudden spike in Tether volume? Is that just a coincidence, or is someone trying to prop up BTC price? artificially?
"Another proud accomplishment of the BlockStream Dream Team.  
Sure, drive out already established merchants from using Bitcoin thanks to insane fees and all but cripple adoption by refusing to scale, after all who needs Bitcoin as a currency when it's primarily a ""store of value"" right?  
Sometimes i think about what Satoshi envisioned as the future of Bitcoin and i weep; thank god there is Bitcoin Cash to carry forward the banner for an inclusive, fast, decentralized and censorship resistant P2P cryptocurrency."
bitcoin cash can take over for almost no cost at all 
translation: steamcoin ICO launching in 10 days.
Well, in fairness, how can they? It's broken. 
WE DID IT BLOCKSTREAM
the beginning of the end. 
"> As of today, Steam will no longer support Bitcoin as a payment method on our platform **due to high fees** and volatility in the value of Bitcoin.

Another victim of the Bitcoin (Core) mafia. Thanks u/theymos u/adam3us u/nullc 

The market can only stay irrational for so long, Bitcoin Core has become unusable. Bitcoin Cash is the future.

Edit: Perhaps Adam Back can show them how to use tabs?"
Or just simply a way to store value like gold.  Except the transaction fees are a lot lower for bitcoin (easier to move, storage is simpler).  I’m not invested in bitcoin or anything but it might have just evolved into something else. 
No you can't and you calling other people names like a child doesn't change things. Bitcoin has no actual function as fees are far too high and transaction times are ridiculous, which is the exact opposite of a valid company which only survives because they have a function. It's not too hard to understand.
That kind of news will get down voted in North Korea
"Probably! Luckily, a lot of coins are going a different route, where mining (like bitcoin) doesn't actually take place. Instead of proof of work, coins are starting to use proof of stake (This is where I don't know enough about it to really talk about sadly. But I do know that this helps with the electricity effort) 

Checkout these coins if you are interested:
ARK, Ripple, NEO"

Maybe they think it'll drop soon so they're withdrawing acceptance?

Really dude? If you can't defend your viewpoint without linking to Wikipedia and not actually making an argument, you shouldn't comment in the first place.
Youre a perfect example of an idiot who invests in a coin at .30 then it tanks and they have to spend all their time shilling and circle jerking in this subreddit to keep their dying hope of making their money back alive.
"He is saying that oil DOES have an intrinsic value and therfore IS/CAN  be used as a currency and BECAUSE OF THAT is also a store of value. And the reason is that you can store it for 10 years and then sell it to someone who can then run his airplane with it.

Bitcoin BTC on the other hand IS LOOSING any intrinsic value IF it is not usable as a currency (which was its purpose) and BECAUSE OF THAT will NOT be a store of value because in 10 years you can just sell it to someone else who then can also NOT do anything with it.

Try Bitcoin Cash $0.1 u/tippr "

"Could the problem not be on Valve's end?

I'm just surprised at all the doom and gloom comments, Valve only started accepting bitcoin a week or two ago, and had a terrible implementation of it. Steam does kind of suck these days, maybe Gabe and his army of algorithms couldnt hack it."
Ok. Good luck, buddy.
"The market can stay irrational far longer than we may expect. The hype driving bitcoin could persist... 

...or it could turn in a day. I've been heavy in BTC for a long time. 

Now I think it's time to make myself antifragile in the crypto space. More BCH. More Dash. Still hold Btc. 

I love crypto in general. Let's build the future. "
"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponzi_scheme

Here i googled it for you. Dont they teach you that in High School these days"
And so it begins...
"Our currency is valued by people's trust + the 2000+ years currency in general has been around, you can't just ""drop"" currency without a suitable replacement to take it's place. That was what Bitcoin was supposed to be.

It's not anymore because of propaganda and hostile actors, but if there is only thing that is true, it's what technology will always win and it will leave those that wouldn't accept it behind."
"Because I'm a total cynical, here's what I think will happen with cryptocurrency. We'll spend several years cycling through this process of a previously promising currency being destroyed from within only for another currency to pop up reverting to the original specifications of bitcoin which becomes widely adopted. Eventually investors and everyday people have own various worthless cryptos demand government regulation on cryptocurrency and we'll eventually end up with a state sponsored ""bitdollar"" that is not finite but rather is a digital implementation of modern Fiat currency which people willingly adopt for it's convenience and security. Maybe this move undercuts the current banking system by allowing people to borrow directly from the central bank at the current interest rate and making things like private home loans obsolete.

We'll end up with some weird combination of unregulated Bitcoin and the federally backed US Dollar in a way that the average person won't really know the difference. I guess at least that's still somewhat of an improvement from what we have today."
Such a shame, they should be accepting Bitcoin Cash.
I’m assuming you don’t mean just Starbucks but retailers in general. There are plenty that you can do the same with bitcoin as you do with paper money. 
Hello, my name is Bitcoin Cash and I work as a means of payment or money if you will (cash) in my free time which I have a lot of (8MB worth, soon to be 32MB). Good to meet you Steam, we are going to have a lot of fun time together!
So long weak playa Volvo. If you HODL why care about high fees?!
