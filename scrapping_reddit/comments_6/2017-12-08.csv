You know, if you actually considered others' POV's, you might actually change your mind.  Or - at least learn something.
"> I honestly doubt we are going to need to increase blocksize any time soon

This is exactly how the 1MB debacle started. We need an exact date and plan ASAP."
"> Uh yes it is. it grows until it saturates.

Stability that comes exclusively from adoption is not an intrinsic feature because it depends on external factors. It cannot be achieved with solely the inherent features of the technology.

>There's always cost at the intersection of fiat and crypto. So you have to pay the cost to get the crypto to send for free.

>Cryptocurrencies only ""provide secure international transactions at no cost"" if you were already holding them anyway.

>Get it??

You're describing an initial start-up cost. Not a repeated cost paid at every transaction.

You asked who would want to invest this start-up cost if BTC was inflationary, and I gave you the example: people who want to engage in international trade using BTC (both to buy and sell) so that they can avoid transaction costs.

It's not that complicated. The technology has plenty of desirable features that justify the start-up cost, but then it has one feature that actually penalizes spending -- which is the #1 function a currency needs to perform. That alone means that this is not a currency. 

>I do not see a negative adoption feedback loop represented here over any significant time period, adoption only seems to go up.

The negative feedback loop is not for adoption. It's for *volatility*. I thought that was plainly clear within context.

If major vendors refuse to adopt BTC because of the volatility, and BTC needs adoption to achieve stability, then this means that BTC is never going to stabilize.

>Yes, more and more people do this. Eventually, almost anyone investing money is doing at least some of this, if only as a hedge. And eventually when enough people are doing this, then over time the risk and reward will go down, and the variability will go down, and people will see it less as a get-rich-quick scheme and more as a sensible long term thing to hold.

So your fantasy here is that BTC is going to become a ""blue chip"" stock. That's the translation of what you just wrote.

Sorry, but this is delusional.

Stocks represent some kind of actual wealth or production or value that is generated in the economy by a company with actual working people doing actual tangible things.

Stocks don't become ""blue chip"" just because lots of people invest in it. That's not how they work. A stock becomes ""blue chip"" when the company itself grows large and builds a reputation for steady, reliable growth in its sector. That consistent history and reputation is what gives investors the confidence to hold the stocks as long term investments. The investment volume does not on its own produce confidence. The volume of investments is a *consequence* of the confidence that comes from the company's performance.

BTC is nothing like this. It has some $270 billion USD worth of market cap, and not a single penny of it is real wealth. It's 100% purely speculative, and it always will be, because it is not representative of any actual contribution to the world economy. There is no underlying product for which we can track performance of profits. There is no underlying company that can inspire long term confidence. It's just the latest imaginary value plaything of short-term investors. Note: the last imaginary value plaything were the mortgage backed derivatives, and they crashed the global finance sector.

>I guess lastly: why are you in this sub to begin with :)

I came in from /r/all. I saw a sensible redditor who recognizes BTC for what it is being downvoted to oblivion by apologists. I posted in support of the guy. And that turned into this conversation eventually. That's why."
Troll someone else.
Or from Chicago. I'm from Chicago. 
"It's ironic, you're accusing me of being a troll, but the second you're engaged w/ someone who disagrees w/ you, you INSTANTLY admit to not even reading what they say - then - repeat that, then turn around and accuse *them* of being a troll.  

You're really upset - did you get burned by BTC? Or are you just a straight up hater b/c you insist on not informing yourself? I'm trying to understand the disdain, here.
"
Troll someone else.
"Catch 22 though --- it's not going to ever get to the point where there is a vendor willing to trade in only bitcoin *because* of the problems right now.

Besides, it seems like BTC is sliding backwards. Steam fucked off and wont take it anymore... I'm sure they're not going to be alone."
"I guess that depends on your definition of fiat. If it is strictly government currency that has no commodity backing then yes it's not a fiat currency. But if your definition is simply currencies that only have value because people as a collective have decided they were valuable not because it has any intrinsic value itself then yes Bitcoin is fiat money.

Fiat essential means ""because I said so"". Bitcoin isn't money because a government ""said so"". *But*, it is money because people ""said so"". "
"I'm *so* impressed.  /s ;-)"
Wtf are u talking about? 
They should’ve switched to bcash.  No volatility. Always 1400-1600 range.
You're expecting to lose 13k and you're just fine with that. Investing is not for you.
Has anyone tried posting this on That Other Sub yet?  It's definitely Bitcoin news.
Troll someone else.
Oh because price volatility just started? No. Tx fees and a time, are the cause. If Bitcoin does not fix this how will it be a currency?
"Inflation may help in that one specific regard but it is an overall harm. It doesn't help people that the price of essentials like food increase at an exponential rate. The inflation is a hidden tax on people; as the central banks print, everyone is getting robbed of the value they worked so hard for *but* they don't know it because they had $100 yesterday and it'll still be $100 tomorrow, though the purchasing power diminishes.

I think it is at least as sinister as it sounds at face value. Enforcing the use of a single fiat currency is anti-free-markets and imo, it is ultimately a way to enslave the working class by making them work for worthless paper while enriching the ruling class. The example you provided is just one example of the wealthy .01% benefitting from a situation that made everyone else miserable."
"The sort by controversial used to be systematic back when /r/bitcoin was pro-big blockers, because they wanted the small block opinion to the top:

https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/6rxw7k/informative_btc_vs_bch_articles/dl8v4lp/?st=jaotbt8m&sh=222ce783

They're just reusing an old technique"
"No, your conservative investing style isn’t for me. I have always done 50% 401k and spread between low and high risk funds. 

The other 50% I made a conscious choice to buy crypto. In the early days the engineering fascinated me as it continues to do. I never expected to go to the moon for real very quickly. I have always evangelized adoption and was big into p2p and changetip. 

This market took a very different turn and the coin is now useless, and I’m working on iota and bch because they are at least functional (iota is young), but hell yes I expected and expect to lose all BTC, but continue enjoying the gains. 

Cashing out half at every double has been fun. Speaking of which, when I started this thread BTC was at 10k and now it’s almost time for me to go cash out another half. "
"> I stopped reading there.

I stopped reading there. I don't give irrational propagandists my time."
"Of course it is not a fiat currency. Gold isn't either. 
Calling it fiat deserves a facepalm."
"LOL, indeed...stew in your butthurt and ignorance, man.  

You literally have no rebuttal, at all - just like all the others.  "
"Don't you worry, I'm all for the original scaling method satoshi proposed - on-chain. ;)

Not going to hit full 32mb blocks for another year for sure though."
Not if I expected neither and expected to lose the 13k
