Cool story bro.
Exactly. Only difference is they don't know whom your sending to.
"> No, a channel is between two people, but you can chain together multiple into a network.

Right, but the whole point is you can pay multiple people in the network, not just the one you're connected to.  If Alice connects to Bob, Bob to Carol, Carol to Dan, and Dan to Evelyn, any of them can send funds to any other.  Carol can sign transactions sending the same funds to both Alice and Evelyn.  What's stopping her, other than the threat that one of them figures it out and closes the channel?

>Alice sending Bob BTC through an open Lightning channel between them is totally secure, even before it gets confirmed due to the nature of the ""close out"" transactions each of them holds.

I understand all this stuff.  I've read the white paper on LN.  But my point is that as long as the channel is open, the security is only hypothetical--if the channel isn't closed, nothing within the channel can enforce against malicious/uncooperative action without closing the channel.  Unless there's some in-channel enforcement mechanism that prevents invalid transactions from being made at all?

>Even with ""cluttered"" channels (Bob having payment channels open to dozens of people), the wallet software manages the monitoring of the blockchain for fraud on any of the channels, so it's not up to Bob's human ability to see through the ""clutter"" and make sure things are on the up-and-up.

That's not what I'm talking about.  The software monitors the blockchain, but nothing hits the blockchain until channels close.  My whole point is that the longer a channel is open, the greater the risk that some not-yet-broadcast fraud can take place.  Yes, that fraud will be nullified when broadcast, but if there's enough time, the real-world transaction may already take place.  Your Bitcoin is protected, but not whatever goods or services you're selling.  

>So, even though it's potentially slower, there's not increased security risk, so long as Bob's client is online at least once every few days or so.

Right, that's my point: it's **slower**.  Alice opens channel to Bob to buy some coffees from his coffeeshop.  This channel also connects to Charlie's grocery store, where Alice does some shopping.  She double-spends on her shopping; perhaps she has to hack her wallet software to do this, perhaps not; we haven't seen any working wallets that support Lightning yet, so I have no idea what exploits may or may not exist.  In any case, Charlie goes to close the channel because he wants his funds.  His and Bob's transactions with Alice are broadcast...but wait, there's a double spend!  This either triggers a refund to all parties, or sweeps all of Alice's funds to either Bob or Charlie, but if the funds Alice committed to the channel don't cover everyone, someone gets left holding a bag.

>As part of settling that new state, she revealed to Bob the key for him to flip that particular transaction, so any time in that week wait, Bob can create a new transaction that uses the secret key of Alice's to sweep the 0.5 BTC into his wallet too, leaving him with 0.7 BTC, and Alice with none, as punishment for her attempted theft.

Well, what if Bob doesn't do that within the time limit?  The contract times out, and he doesn't get Alice's funds.  If Alice can prevent Bob from making that transaction, or count on Bob not realizing he even needs to, say by using malware or an exploit in Bob's wallet software, then that security method breaks.

Furthermore, this whole setup relies on contracts.  As we've seen from Ethereum with the DAO hack, contracts can have exploits.  Opening a payment channel means you're only as secure as the contract, and malicious actors could provide deceptive contracts, which nevertheless are valid.  So maybe Alice's opening contract was deceptive, and when Bob tries to sweep her funds after closing the channel, discovers that actually it sweeps his funds instead?  Or just does nothing?

>but while mining blocks on the main BTC blockchain, if they created a block that didn't handle a Segregated Witness transaction properly, it would get shunned by the rest of the network.

How does that work, exactly?  The transaction is still going to be technically valid, so it's not like the miner is propagating a block with an invalid transaction in it.  Perhaps the wallet software has something built in to detect?  But even if it does, software can be exploited.  The point of the blockchain is that only with 51% or more of hashpower (which is expensive to obtain) can the security be broken, and the risk/reward for breaking the security will always be less favorable than acting honestly.  Any vulnerabilities that exist before the blockchain don't have that kind of game-theoretic protection."
"> If Alice connects to Bob, Bob to Carol, Carol to Dan, and Dan to Evelyn, any of them can send funds to any other. Carol can sign transactions sending the same funds to both Alice and Evelyn. What's stopping her, other than the threat that one of them figures it out and closes the channel?

In the topology you gave (`A`&harr;`B`&harr;`C`&harr;`D`&harr;`E`), If `C` wants to spend to `A`, that would be a transaction that spends from the ""`B`&harr;`C`"" channel. `C` spending to `E` is the ""`C`&harr;`D`"" channel. So `C` spending to both `A` and `E` at the same time is perfectly valid, since it would pull from two separate pots of pre-allocated funds.

If instead you had a star topology (`A` has a channel open to every other letter in the set), then `C` spending to `B` (`C`&harr;`A`&harr;`B`) and `C` spending to `E` (`C`&harr;`A`&harr;`E`) both use the ""`C`&harr;`A`"" channel as the funding source. In that case, it's up to `A` to make sure that transactions happen in order (that all state updates to the ""`C`&harr;`A`"" channel properly invalidate the previous ones before moving on. Since it's now only one channel instead of two, the channel logic itself can enforce the ordering, without needing two channels or clients or humans to collaborate on the watchdog aspect.

> if the channel isn't closed, nothing within the channel can enforce against malicious/uncooperative action without closing the channel. Unless there's some in-channel enforcement mechanism that prevents invalid transactions from being made at all

Updating a channel to a new state requires both parties cooperating. If both parties don't cooperate, the state simply does not update, and stays at the ""last known good"" state. In that way it prevents ""invalid transactions"" from being generated at all. Though the risk is there that a badly-written client could not properly check that the other channel participant is behaving properly and accept a new state change transaction when it really shouldn't. But that's true of any cryptocurrency client, not just Lightning Channel clients (an improperly-designed Bitcoin client could create a transaction that sends all the user's coins to badly-derived public address, such that they're completely lost). Rigorous testing of Lightning Channel client software is just as important as rigorous testing of peer-to-peer node software, to prevent that sort of thing.

> My whole point is that the longer a channel is open, the greater the risk that some not-yet-broadcast fraud can take place. Yes, that fraud will be nullified when broadcast, but if there's enough time, the real-world transaction may already take place. Your Bitcoin is protected, but not whatever goods or services you're selling.

How does the risk increase as the channel remains open? If someone can be tricked into not checking the state of the blockchain for a week, they can be conned out of their money, but that could happen at any time (not just after a long time has passed). If you're looking at the situation where the fraud is indeed caught, then you get the other party's funds too, to cover the loss of your goods/services. Let's take a coffee shop example: Alice frequently visits a certain coffee shop. She opens a payment channel with them with a bunch of funds, intending it to cover her monthly coffee purchases there. The initial opening of the payment channel she does via the coffee shop's website, and it takes a few hours for the transaction to get mined into the blockchain. Now, every day, Alice approaches the counter, indicates she wants to buy a coffee and with her Lightning client app on her smartphone does a state-updating handshake with the coffee shop's wallet and instantly updates the state, and Alice walks out with her coffee. But Alice actually keeps the original state transaction saying she gets all the funds. By the end of the month, 80% of the funds are now allocated to the coffee shop instead of Alice. Alice now has received the goods (coffee), and the coffee shop is on track to receive 80% of the channel funds (fair compensation for the coffee), but if Alice broadcasts her fraudulent state transaction and gets caught, the coffee shop gets 100% of the channel funds (more than fair compensation for the coffee they gave out). Yes, there's no built in means for return/refund of any goods transacted, but a properly funded channel ends up giving more than the fair share to the victimized party to compensate them.

> How does that work, exactly? The transaction is still going to be technically valid, so it's not like the miner is propagating a block with an invalid transaction in it.

Actually, I believe to a core client, it's not technically valid. So yes, the miner is propagating a block with an invalid transaction in it. Looking just at the script of a Segregated Witness transaction, there is an ""Anyone can spend"" command, but looking at the transaction overall, Segregated-Witness-supporting clients would notice first that its a Segregated Witness address, so use separate logic (parsing the witness) to determine transaction validity, not the ""anyone can spend"" opcode. If a transaction attempted to satisfy just the ""anyone can spend"" script, that would be an invalid transaction to all Segregated Witness clients, and any block that included such a transaction would be invalid and thrown out."
"Thanks for a reasoned and civil response!  Good god is it ever a relief to discuss this stuff with someone who doesn't immediately dismiss me as a shill or a sock puppet for supporting BCH.

>could you explain what you mean how a double-spend could happen with an open Lightning Channel?

Imagine a channel opened between multiple parties.  You can't double-spend if it's only a two-party channel, but two-party channels don't solve scalability issues really (and can already exist on pre-SegWit Bitcoin without Lightning Network, as it happens).  If you have multiple parties, say Alice, Bob, and Charlie, Alice can sign two transactions with the same coin, one each to Bob and Charlie.  Closing the channel would invalidate one of them, but as long as the channel is open, they're in an indeterminate state as far as the blockchain is concerned.  Only the opening and closing transactions matter.  If Alice is purchasing goods or services from both Bob and Charlie, based on the signed transactions in the channel, then by the time the channel closes, either Bob or Charlie may be left holding the bag.  Depending on the contracts it may even cause a refund to all parties due to an invalid transaction, and Alice got her goods for free.

>If a naive client (based on old code) or an intentional attacker tries to sweep funds from a SegWit address, they would need to mine the transaction themselves

Why?  Couldn't they just use RBF to jump over the original transaction in the mempool? I agree that it stops becoming an issue when SegWit adoption hits majority, but it's a long ways off from that, and potential adopters are facing a Prisoner's Dilemma: adopt early and face greater risk, but save some time and money on transactions, or stick with legacy code and deal with a congested (but safer) network.  A hard fork would have forced an update, and that would have been better IMO."
"> Thanks for a reasoned and civil response!

Indeed! And you as well! I'm a developer, so tend to analyze things from the logical inner workings out, and when people start relying on sheer emotion and namecalling, there's no real progress to be made there discussing.

I see you saying

>  Alice can sign two transactions with the same coin, one each to Bob and Charlie. Closing the channel would invalidate one of them, but as long as the channel is open, they're in an indeterminate state as far as the blockchain is concerned

And

> Couldn't they just use RBF to jump over the original transaction [the one that opens the channel] in the mempool?

I think both of those show one misconception about where channel transactions end up. It seems you're under the impression that the ""open a Lightning channel"" transaction stays in the mempool until the channel is closed? That's not the case, and may be the source of some confusion.

When talking about Lightning Channels, there's three collections of transactions that need get used. There's the transactions on the blockchain (which are permanent, and cannot be changed once verified), ones in the mempool (which are wanting to get on the blockchain as soon as possible), and ones not yet broadcast (valid, signed transactions, which could be projected into the network by anyone). The ones not yet broadcast will never make it into the blockchain, since they're privately-held; only the party or parties who created them know of the transaction. A fully-valid and signed transaction could be broadcast by anyone (not just the creator), but until someone does, the world doesn't know about it.

When Alice and Bob want to open a Lightning network channel, they have to do some communication privately among themselves that creates a transaction with some of Alice's inputs and some of Bob's inputs, signed by both parties and dumping it into a ""pay to script hash"" address, where the script is some special math sauce that makes the channel concept work. That transaction to open the channel stays in the ""not yet broadcast"" category until both Alice and Bob have signed it, and then one of them broadcasts it to the mempool _and it gets included into the blockchain_. It does **not** hang out in the mempool; from the blockchain's perspective, Alice and Bob have both transferred money to an escrow account, and those funds now belong to neither of them (and can only be spent by the escrow account, not Alice or Bob any more; that would be a double-spend).

But privately, Alice and Bob both have close-out transactions that close out the escrow account and transfer the funds owed to them back to themselves. But Alice and Bob don't broadcast those transactions to the mempool; they're just privately held by Alice and Bob. Either of them could broadcast at any time, but they don't. To update the state of who owns how much asset, Alice and Bob agree to create new close-out transactions with different amounts. The original close-out transactions they throw out and the world never knows of them (they never even hit the mempool, much less the blockchain). When Alice and Bob are ready, they each broadcast their own close-out transactions to the mempool, which then gets added to the blockchain, getting their funds back out of escrow.

So, from your example, if Alice wants to open a channel to Bob and to Charlie, and she uses the same inputs to create both channels, neither channel is considered ""open"" by any of their Lightning-enabled clients until the initial ""open"" transaction gets into **the blockchain** (not just the mempool). Once one of them gets into the blockchain, the other one is recognized as a double-spend, and would get deleted by the mempool by all nodes in the network (even those that don't know about Lightning channel logic, they know the funds are trying to move from one address to a new ""pay to script hash"" address, and even naive nodes can detect that double-spend).

Same thing for using a Replace By Fee transaction to abort the ""open"" transaction. Both parties in a channel could work together to create a new ""open"" transaction that has a higher fee that the original one they created, but neither one's client would detect that the channel is open and ready until one of the two made it into the blockchain itself.

Speaking just of Segregated Witness addresses (which are separate from Lightning Channel addresses), the reason why I said a naive client or attacker would need to mine a ""collect from this 'anyone can spend' address"" themselves is based on the assumption that all miners support Segregated Witness and would see a transaction attempting to spend those coins incorrectly as invalid and would simply not include it in a block. Hence you'd need a miner who wasn't following the rules of Segregated Witness, which would likely be the attacker themselves (since if a miner didn't support Segregated Witness, to be most profitable, they would just sweep the addresses themselves, rather than just serving as a conduit for someone else to profit from it). Make sense?"
"> But the way you are describing these channels as if they only ever involve two parties at a time; my understanding of Lightning is that a channel can contain multiple parties, and that that is how Lightning provides a scaling solution.

No, a channel is between two people, but you can chain together multiple into a network. Alice can open a channel to Bob, and Bob can open a channel to Carol. Alice can then pay Carol without directly opening a channel to her, by using the existing Alice-to-Bob-to-Carol connection. Bob's wallet, just being online and connected to the network can handle the Alice-to-Carol transaction for them, without him needing to manually be there when Alice wants to pay Carol.

> It seems to me that using Lightning is not really any more **secure** than using a 0-conf transaction, and may possibly be less secure, because Lightning potentially increases the **delay** in the closing transaction even hitting the mempool.

A merchant that accepts a zero-confirmation transaction from Alice runs the risk that Alice leaves the shop and double-spends the same inputs back to herself with a higher fee. As long as the higher fee Alice paid is less than the amount of the bill she just had at the merchant, it's a net gain for her, and a total loss for the merchant. That's why zero-confirmation transactions are not secure.

Alice sending Bob BTC through an open Lightning channel between them is totally secure, even before it gets confirmed due to the nature of the ""close out"" transactions each of them holds. For example, assume they started a channel with Alice contributing 0.5 BTC and Bob contributing 0.2 BTC. As part of that setup, Alice would now have in her possession a transaction that closes out the channel and gives Bob 0.2 BTC immediately, and 0.5 BTC to her after a week. Bob has a similar close-out transaction held in his possession (not broadcast to the mempool at all), sending to Alice 0.5 immediately, and to his address 0.2 BTC after a week.

Now, Alice is making a big purchase from Bob (0.4 BTC total), and Bob says to Alice that she needs to send him 0.1 BTC as a down payment. Several things could now happen here:

- Alice doesn't want to pay, so she just remains silent and stops responding to Bob. Bob eventually gives up and broadcasts his transaction, which gives Alice her 0.5 BTC back immediately, and he can get his 0.2 BTC back after a week with no interaction from Alice.
- Alice doesn't want to pay, so she argues/haggles with Bob to drop the down payment to 0.05 BTC. If Alice pushes too hard, Bob can just broadcast his transaction to give Alice her money back, and eventually get his 0.2 BTC back and walk away.
- Alice doesn't want to pay, but says that she will pay the 0.1 BTC. She and Bob generate new cash-out transactions such that Alice has a transaction that transfers 0.4 BTC to her after a week, and 0.3 BTC to Bob immediately. Bob gets a transaction that transfers 0.3 BTC to him after a week, and 0.4 BTC to Alice immediately.
 - As part of this close-out transaction creation, Alice and Bob have to **reveal to each other a key that modifies the output that has the ""in a week"" timeout part on the original close out transaction to immediately spend to the other person**.
 - Bob throws out his old cash-out transaction (that says he gets 0.2 BTC after a week), as he should, but Alice keeps hers that says she gets 0.5 BTC after a week.
 - Alice broadcasts the old cash-out transaction (immediately giving Bob 0.2 BTC), attempting to close out the channel using that old state that was in her favor (a double-spend). But she has to wait a week for her 0.5  BTC. As part of settling that new state, she revealed to Bob the key for him to flip that particular transaction, so any time in that week wait, Bob can create a new transaction that uses the secret key of Alice's to sweep the 0.5 BTC into his wallet too, leaving him with 0.7 BTC, and Alice with none, as punishment for her attempted theft.

So, in all cases of Alice attempting to be fraudulent, Bob has a means to stop her. In the case of broadcasting a stale state transaction, as long as Bob notices within the week-or-so time window, he can punish Alice for attempting to misbehave. Bob himself wouldn't actually need to do this; the idea is the wallet software would monitor the mempool and blockchain and do that sort of policing on its own. So, even though it's potentially **slower**, there's not increased security risk, so long as Bob's client is online at least once every few days or so.

For a more in-depth look, [this tutorial](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/understanding-the-lightning-network-part-building-a-bidirectional-payment-channel-1464710791/) is a good one to 

Even with ""cluttered"" channels (Bob having payment channels open to dozens of people), the wallet software manages the monitoring of the blockchain for fraud on any of the channels, so it's not up to Bob's human ability to see through the ""clutter"" and make sure things are on the up-and-up.

Because payment channels are only between two people, if you find a case where the other party is acting up, you can close out that channel without adversely affecting other channels (other than not having that link available any more for multi-person payment hops).

> all miners **don't** currently support Segregated Witness

All miners on the Bitcoin Core blockchain have been producing blocks that support (as a feature) Segregated Witness addresses/transactions. They may not _philosophically_ support it, but while mining blocks on the main BTC blockchain, if they created a block that didn't handle a Segregated Witness transaction properly, it would get shunned by the rest of the network. So, if a miner is hopping between chains, while on the BTC chain, they either need to filter out all Segregated Witness transactions from blocks they produce on that chain (financial disadvantage; some of those transactions may have the most fees offered), or follow the rules of Segregated Witness transactions."
I don't believe it'll rally indefinably. I believe BCH will however never surpass the price of BTC.
">It seems you're under the impression that the ""open a Lightning channel"" transaction stays in the mempool until the channel is closed?

No, not at all.  I'm no developer, but I understand that Lightning channels function as an escrow account in a sense; all parties involved in opening the channel do so by declaring the balance with which they are entering the channel, and that goes to the blockchain.  But the way you are describing these channels as if they only ever involve two parties at a time; my understanding of Lightning is that a channel can contain multiple parties, and that that is how Lightning provides a scaling solution.  Bitcoin (and Bitcoin Cash) as they are already [allow for individual payment channels](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Payment_channels).  Lightning takes it a step further (as far as I understand) by creating a whole network of bundled payment channels.  

Or in other words, under Lightning, Alice isn't opening a channel to Bob and a channel to Charlie; she's got Bob and Charlie in one channel, and can send funds to either of them within the channel from the amount she committed when the channel was opened.

Basically, it seems to me that using Lightning is not really any more secure than using a 0-conf transaction, and may possibly be less secure, because Lightning potentially increases the delay in the closing transaction even hitting the mempool.  All that gets confirmed when the channel opens is the amount of your funds entering the channel.  

Whatever transactions occur in the channel remain unconfirmed until the channel closes, and if you attempt to be malicious or uncooperative within the channel, you risk one of the other parties closing the channel and activating the consequences of the initial contract (which may be forfeiting all the funds you entered with to one party, or may be refunding everyone's funds and negating everything, or any other number of stipulations that are up to the users).  But with enough ""noise"" in a busy channel, an uncooperative user may go undetected, and invalid transactions among various channel participants will persist until the channel closes.  The onus of securing transactions is placed on the vulnerable party--you're only as secure as you are aware of the actions and intents of the parties with which you are transacting, and unless you close the channel when you catch someone being uncooperative, no consequences obtain from their malicious action (other than someone getting stiffed on a payment when the channel finally closes).

>the reason why I said a naive client or attacker would need to mine a ""collect from this 'anyone can spend' address"" themselves is based on the assumption that all miners support Segregated Witness

Well, that's the problem: all miners **don't** currently support Segregated Witness, and until they do, the risk exists.  I agree that when SegWit adoption becomes majority, the vulnerability goes away...although if it's a low majority, it only takes a small percentage to deactivate to restore the vulnerability.  Because it's a soft fork, deactivation is always possible, and the ability to conduct this sort of attack creates incentive for that.  At 51% activation, 2% of the activated miners could deactivate and the majority is lost; exploiting the vulnerability on a few large transactions would be quite the take!"
">Canonical transaction order

Isn't this required for Gaven's new Graphene scaling? "
Sorry but if you follow the above link to the master repo you’ll see a project that is barely alive. Let’s get serious here
But if nodes need to first sort the transactions included in a block that would impair the parallelization of the code. I remember seeing that mentioned in some Bitcoin scaling presentation.
I can't seem to find references to this in the white paper.
If this is just about storage, isn't this pretty similar to pruning?
So we are torrenting the block chain P2P?
If there is a gap between blocks they have on file how can they validate them?
That works too  should be easy enough with the new DAA too. 
Ideally it would almost never get to that stage. 
Hmm not really. I don't think many orphan blocks survive more than a few seconds. The amount of hashpower wasted on orphan blocks as a percentage overall would increase a touch, but really it's not much in the grand scheme. As block propagation technology improves (graphene etc) this will become even less of an issue. I agree that faster block times are a good thing to aim for, but it would also mean changing the block reward as well. 
Segwit didn't have consensus at all. It only activated because of the promise of 2X.
Good point, I'd like to see clarification on this as well. Will these changes require network consensus? I don't see why anyone would vote against any of these changes but it's important tool to keep the network democratic (for better or worse).
"Segwit in itself is not super terrible but it overcomplicates the code unnecessarily. Something like Flextrans is better: https://bitcoinclassic.com/devel/FlexTrans-vs-SegWit.html .

The whitepaper says something against the 1mb limit/LN and Segwit, but it never says anything that says that sharding is not ok.
it's in the spirit of the white paper. if you want black and white thinking you're in the wrong sub
*Sharding* is similar to how the [BitTorrent Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent#Operation) operates, where many peers collectively share separate pieces of a larger data set. *Pruning* is a trusted procedure of cutting the chain at a certain point in the past and effectively eliminating the storage of earlier blocks.
Pruning is a way to have small end-user wallets by them having to downlaod only the latest n blocks. Sharding would change the way nodes work, by distributing different parts of the chain to different nodes.

"But you can't enforce FIFO in that case, you can only trust the miner to do it, which they wont and shouldn't. Unless I'm missing what you mean by FIFO, assume it means first into the mempool first into the block.

They will most likely not have gaps between blocks in their storage. If nodes need info on blocks before/after their own blocks they will contact other nodes.

So something that is not implemented, has no plan to implement and is just something we will ""move towards"", ""perhaps"" using a certain method.  In other words, we don't know how we will do it.

Yep, some things are definitely easier to implement via hardfork, but that doesn't mean its the right path.  I'll full admit (and have elsewhere) that I *think* BTC could benefit from a block size increase.  However, as I stated elsewhere... I also know enough to know I don't know enough about the implications.

> Sorry, I got a little lazy towards the end, but it's important to understand that SegWit, while not terrible in itself, was a huge hack that solves a few easy problems in a really roundabout way, simply so they could do it as a softfork. Turns out if you're willing to work with miners rather than antagonizing them, you can get things done in much more straightforward way.

You are free to call it what you will, but I will say one person saying something is a hack is another person saying somebody is a genius for figuring out a way.

I'll also defnitely agree that miners were antagonized wrongfully.  However, I'll also say that I don't *think* that started happening until miners were saying they would not adopt Segwit and were being seen as a barrier to progress.  Then of course it came to light about asicboost and it added fuel to the fire about why miners might be blocking segwit because asicboost would then be broken."
"> No one is claiming BCH can't add features that aren't in the white paper, just that these don't go against it being a chain of witnesses and as an electronic cash.

Why do you think you can cherry pick one thing from the whitepaper and say that one item is NOT ok to change but other things are OK to change?  Either the whitepaper is the bible and should be followed strictly, or you need to treat the whitepaper as a starting place and understand that things will change.  Personally, I believe it was a starting place.  Saying its a bible shuts the door on innovation and Satoshi was no god.  Brilliant.. probably, but I think the person that created a consensus based system would be absolutely ashamed to see people then treat him like everything he says is the word of god.  Kind of seems like the exact opposite of what he was going for.

> Maybe you can explain why SegWit was necessary. What are the real benefits versus a regular block size increase? Transaction malleability can be fixed ways that don't remove witnesses from the header.

As for Segwit, its not just about Segwit vs blocksize increase.  Segwit is not just a capacity increase, its just a side benefit.  I'll say I absolutely agree the blocksize limit will need to increase.  I'll also say I believe that BTC could *possibly* benefit from it right now.  However, I also know enough to know I don't know enough.  Its a highly complex system and I don't understand all of the intricacies and implications of certain things would be.  Neither does the vast majority of the Bitcoin or Bcash communities.  WIth that, I will say, if you want to know more about Segwit, then I recomend you read this page: https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/01/26/segwit-benefits/"
who exactly did that?  it wasn't gavin was it?
It won't. Syncing time is a very difficult problem. Bitcoin is a timestamping system at the most basic. Making it dependant on nodes keeping correct time is to make the system worse.
EDA is the past (removed), and it looked only at the already mined blocks.
There will be a low storage/high latency pay off. The more of the block you have on your hard drive the faster your client can verify everything. The less you have the longer it will take for your client to find the data it needs but this matters more the older an address or transaction is and so buried deeper in to the block chain. Just like how when you download a movie over torrents if it's a very old movie you won't find as many seeds as for a new popular movie. 
"That seems wrong, at least in general terms. If the transactions are in sorted order, you don't need to sort them, but you benefit from sorting only if you process each transaction in order. But if you do that then you don't get the benefit of parallelism for processing the UTXO changes.

If the new rule merely says ""parent transactions must be in the same block, but not necessarily before the child transaction"", you can parallelize validation without sorting:

Each worker thread keeps a set of ""UTXOs spent that didn't exist before the block"", and a set of ""UTXOs created"". At the end, unify the spent-nonexistent UTXO sets (should be disjoint), unify the created UTXO sets (should be disjoint), and check that the former is a strict subset of the latter. The remainder is UTXOs that can be spent in future blocks.

Mind you this technique could be used today as well, but you'd need to use a map of ""position-within-the-block"" instead, which would be more costly."
ahh thanks I got it
No because it has to be accepted by the network which will know the difficulty doesn't match the time.
"Care to explain these better ways to enlighten me a little?

Here is the list of implications for Segwit: https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/01/26/segwit-benefits/

Well it says that in the abstract, not the title.  However the abstract  talks about nodes using their CPU power to generate the blockchain.  Point is, the whitepaper is not a bible and if you want to treat it as such then BCH needs to take a difficult look in the mirror.
"> Furthermore, the hard fork implements two minor changes from the BIP146 soft fork, which has been bundled to SegWit by Bitcoin Core. The enforcement of LOW_S signatures and Nullfail. Both are said to eliminate some parts of third-party malleability

Defective core ejected!
Ethereum-like stuff.
It would enable smart contracts, private transactions, faster 0 conf, etc etc. All the good things Bitcoin Segwit removed from the main chain, because Blockstream wants to create a side chain with those opcodes active so they can be the only company to receive profit from those opcodes. BITCOIN Cash wants to have everything DEcentralized and on chain where everyone can profit.
Bitcoin has a Script language, similar to other programming languages -opcode can be thought of a keyword in the language for performing an operation. In its earlier years some of these words were removed due to bugs in their implementation, guessing ABC will solve the issue and reintroduce the keywords(opcodes) making script a more capable language for contract design.
"> I do that basically for btcpop already...
I've a storage cluster with GlusterFS in replicated distribution mode so Data is stored on several nodes.

I will pretend to know what this is about, but in reality, I don't have a clue what btcPop is."
It's a random sort, yes, but what matters is only that each node order the transactions in the same order, not that they have any other specific order.
"You can't create a canonical ordering without an agreement on what that ordering will be, and that agreement must also be resilient against the vagaries of the physical world.

Median time past is a fancy way of saying ""the median timestamp of the last n blocks"". If I want the ""time six blocks ago,"" I look back 11 blocks, and take the median timestamps of all 11."
It's when 6 blocks have a more recent timestamp than the specified value.
"In order to use Graphene in the most efficient way all miners need to sort their transactions the same way.

First in would be problematic because they might receive the tx in a different order.

So if I mess with my clock, I might be able to get an easier difficulty than other miners? Well thought through 
"That would screw up the random distibution.. not sure if it is a good idea,

Bobtail would fix that and make selfish mining harder."
That would require the miners to agree on what time it is, which is a lot harder than it sounds
"> instead of risking that we end up with yet another Core team.

Which in a way is how this post sounds. Notice the use of time stamps to activate changes indicating that it's a user activated fork not miner activated. Meaning such a fork could easily fail to gain consensus. If they are to try and ensure that these changes take effect regardless of consensus (which is basically the founding of BCH mind you) then that's essentially saying the protocol isn't autonomous but rather just a loyal fallowing of Bitcoin ABC's dev team. That makes it sound even more power hungry than Bitcoin Core. It's UASF/UAHFers... "
But if the block time was too low, then the rate of orphaned blocks would increase, and the first few confirmations would be unreliable.
"What matters is the total amount of work; replacing the first block is easy, replacing all the blocks since the first block is borderline impossible. Replacing 60 one minute blocks is just as hard as replacing 6 ten minutes blocks."

Therefor dependent transactions need *not* be spread over multiple blocks with this new scheme."
Essentially you cut up the chain, and nodes don't hold the entire chain but instead only parts of the chain, which reduces the storage needed for a node which allows for many small nodes instead of a few very big ones.
The DAA was manipulated for fast blocks by miners, I don't see why you'll want it to continue 
"Ah, I see, sorry.

My preferred approach for realigning the halvening dates with the ideal calculation, would be to adjust the target block time to be slightly slower based on the total average time so far, in such way that after a certain number of years the dates would align. I think that would be more elegant than messing with the rewards or the block count based cycle."
The problem I see is if people get used to trusting 0-confirmation, then they start doing bigger and bigger transactions with it, until they get rekt.
If the competing coins provide it then yes. Otherwise loose out to market forces. 
I think you also don't know that there was no limit on the block size when Satoshi released the first version of Bitcoin
Again, showing how ill informed you are. Bitcoin Unlimited has a large team, as does ABC, XT, Parity, Bitprim... I know many of the devs personally, and I am extremely excited to see them pushing Bitcoin Cash forward. This narrative that only Core can develop for Bitcoin is absolutely ridiculous.
Well indeed bobtail would awesomely fix that :p
"You mean at https://reviews.bitcoinabc.org? I see tons of activity there. They don't do development on Github, they merely mirror their last releases source code there. Also, if you don't pay attention to bitcoin-ml you won't get the full picture either. I am guessing you just rattle off this BS because you can't bother looking, or are hoping to spread FUD.

EDIT: Not to mention this is merely one Bitcoin Cash team. There is activity on all of them, that is why the DAA hard fork went smoothly. The teams know how to cooperate and move quickly, while testing code extensively before rolling it out on the network."
"**Lightning Network**

The Lightning Network is a proposed solution to the bitcoin scalability problem. The software uses an off-chain protocol and is currently in alpha phase of development. It features a P2P system for making micropayments of digital currencies such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, Vertcoin through a scale-free network of bidirectional payment channels without delegating custody of funds or trust to third parties.

It is expected that normal use of the Lightning Network consists of opening a payment channel by committing a funding transaction to the relevant blockchain, followed by making any number of Lightning transactions that update the tentative distribution of the channel's funds without broadcasting to the blockchain, followed by closing the payment channel by broadcasting the final version of the transaction to distribute the channel's funds.

"I have some rebuttals. Sharding isn't a standard practice in blockchains and blockchains are a very special type of database. Paradigms that works well on standard mysql databases don't work well in blockchains or in say mongodb. Since write access to a blockchain requires a provable piece of work it get incredibly complex to distribute. And to only distribute read access isn't really useful right now or in the near future.

Segwit isn't ""tacking extra storage"" anymore than a blocksize increase is tacking extra storage. Segwit is a reorganization of the data structure in the block. Segregated witness data is just as much a part of a block as everything else. And segwit is a lot of gain. We get a malleabillity fix, we get script versioning and we get a higher throughput without having to hard fork.

The requirement that is backward compatibility does mean that the entirety of the segwit system isn't as pretty as it could be but the principle itself of segregating witness data isn't dirty or dangerous at all."
Oh, what trouble? Details please.
"But pruning is the devil? The fact that segwit enabled nodes could someday in the future discard some transaction witness data is heresy here. 

So how come sharding isn't? Seems like a massive case of ""not invented here"" syndrome to me."
Thanks for answering his question, even with a quick few words. What I'm sending in general is that bitcoin cash supporters are super against segwit. Meaning they will come up with other solutions to fix things without using segwit (separate of block capacity debate). Meaning that instead of activating segwit on bigger blocks people are looking at other ways to solve all the issues segwit has specifically solved. That's fine, but the hate seems strong. Now, based on recent announcement that ABC will be handling all the hard forks and taking over as a reference client for Cash. What happens when people disagree with their implementation. Seems now there is a central development authority in charge of all the HFs like it or not 
"The only major issue right now is the blocksize constraint causing periodic high fees, that needs to be fixed pronto. 

BCH fixed that and could keep.its $.01 fees even if servicing BTC's current transaction load. Segwit still hasn't delivered any meaningful increase all these months later and let's see what it finally ends up delivering.

And 2nd layers like lightning actually work better with non full blocks and low fees."
"If you do want to avoid trolling, id suggest to use BCH or Bitcoin Cash. Bcash is considered derogatory by BCH supporters since it emphasizes Cash and deemphasizes Bitcoin.

Yes Bitcoin Cash may be a little confusing to some which is why I support changing the logo color to green versus orange to help differentiate. 

I agree with Jihan Wu that Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin Cash, doesn't mean it can't be considered by myself to be a flavor of Bitcoin. I wouldn't tell a noob that to keep it simple.

BCH has the same history as BTC until August 1st, and was forked to get back to its roots and considered by our side to be true to the original intention of what Bitcoin should be.

I've enjoyed our spirited yet civil debate though need to get back to work for now. "
"You don't need to run a node in pruned more or with sharding.  
Those are optional modes to allow more users running nodes even with bigger base blocks.  
You still can run nodes with the full blocks on them if you want to.  "
">  It's states directly how they should do this, and how the chain should be stored.

>I never stated that the white paper stated that every node should store the full blockchain. 


What is it now? The whitepaper only talks about how nodes validate and process new blocks, it doesn't say that every node needs to validate every new block and that you can't split up the chain between nodes."
I think you’ve got a good point, seems to me like we are a long way off needing things like sharding, if ever, which is a major change. Blockstream’s propaganda has worked, people are too happy to create problems today to solve a problem that will not happen in the foreseeable future.
"Ok. Why is the whitepaper against 1mb/LN/Segwit?

- ""Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System""

- ""A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online
payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a
financial institution.""

Those points directly disagree with L2 solutions and the crippled 1mb limit.

As for SegWit, look at the graphic in Point 2. SegWit signatures are handled differently than in the whitepaper described.

> Sharding isn't in the whitepaper

Yes, so where is the problem?"
"> Please explain this in detail.

I'll explain it in the time I've got spare in between doing other things.

Sharding is an industry standard technique used to add massive scale to all kinds of databases. It's a well known and well respected method of adding scale to 'stuff'. Segwit is just tacking an extra storage block into the side of an existing block, like adding a big shed at the bottom of your garden. It's a crude trick that means any data access not needs a trip to the shed, instead of the data just 'being there'. It makes things slower, increases bandwidth usage, and storage usage, for no gain. The single advantage of SegWit is that it allow a dirty and dangerous accounting trick called a 'soft fork'.

Good computer science means industry standard practice. The kind of practice that's used to build massive scale data stores all over the world.
"
He means it is a solution that causes more trouble than it solves.
"I guess shrading is optional like pruned mode.  
So you can still decide to keep the full blockchain but also have the option to set nodes with shrading.  
Companies like ours could setup a main node with the full blockchain and optional other nodes with shrading to reduce the storage needs."
"I don't have the time, but here goes a quick overview:

Malleability fixes - see flextrans for another approach to fix without doing segwit

Quadhash - already fully fixed by BCH

Signing of input values - seems minor and I don't see a reason why you need segwit to include a hash of the input values

Increased p2sh security - if a real issue then I'm sure BCH will apply a fix. Again don't see why SegWit is needed for this fix

Script versioning - seems only needed for soft forks which BCH doesn't want to do

Reducing UTXO growth - I don't know but assume if an issue, BCH will address it

Efficiency gains when ignoring witnesses - not needed 

Block size increase - really? I'll take the 8 MB real increase in BCH versus whatever Segwit finally ends up providing.

Moving towards a single combined block limit - see Bitcoin ABC dev plan released today for possible plans for an adaptive block size limit





"
"> BCH will add features with respect to the white paper of the genius who created it. BTC does not, and likes to pretend the white paper doesn't exist.

As I've already stated elsewhere, maybe even to you... I personally believe that the whitepaper is a starting place.  Its not a bible that must be strictly adhered to.  If you want to think of it as a bible then go ahead.  That shuts the door on innovation and you'll find you become as irrelevant as you get left behind those that are moving forward.

> I thought BTC is now primarily a store of value coin since high fees can and do happen by design?

Its both a store of value, a cash system, and many other things.  Fees are absolutely by design.  I'll fully agree that I think fees for a regular transaction are a bit high right now.   However I did send a few TXs on the BTC network a couple days ago for around 75-80 sat/byte.  If I had been sending a small amount of BTC I would definitely think this is unreasonable.  It was under $1 in total..  but obviously that is too much if you make small purchases.  Hence why there are layer 2 solutions on the horizon to address this.

> Finally, no one owns the name Bitcoin so we have as much right as you to use Bitcoin in our name - Bitcoin Cash. If you want to use bcash, then we can call BTC bcore. Or if you aren't trying to troll, can use BTC and BCH instead.

I never said anything about the right to the name Bitcoin.  I do fully agree that nobody owns the name Bitcoin and can call whatever they want Bitcoin.  You can even read through my post history if you wish.  I promise you'll find a post or 2 in the last month on /r/bitcoin were I even say Bitcoin Core devs do not own the term Bitcoin and anybody is free to call their fork Bitcoin because nobody owns it and its up to every user to determine what Bitcoin is to them.

So call it whatever you will, Bcore is a pretty poor analogy though, as it references only a single implementation of the BTC network (which if you check my recent post history again, I linked to probably 5 different ones all participating in the ""Bitcoin"" (BTC) network today)

Why is everybody so hung up on ""Bitcoin Cash"" being called Bcash?  Its not insulting in any way?  I have seen others refer to it as ""Bcrash"", which sure, I would say is insulting... you'll also find I've never used that term.  I personally believe that referring to ""Bitcoin Cash"" as ""Bitcoin Cash"" is confusing to new entrants to ""Bitcoin"".  Somebody could very easily see ""Bitcoin Cash"" and think they are buying ""Bitcoin"".  Then they might do something like buy BCH thinking its BTC, send to tx to a BTC segwit address and now their funds are gone forever.  That is not good for new people.  You can apply my same thoughts to ""Bitcoin Gold"" and why I would refer to it as Bgold.

> Anyway, competition is good and may the best flavor of Bitcoin win.

Well even Jihan Wu says that BCH is not a ""flavor of Bitcoin"":

"Either you are a fool or a propagandist.

Sharding isn't in the whitepaper directly. Segwit isn't in the whitepaper directly.
Sharding is not adequately described and runs counter to: ""If a node does not receive a block, it will request it when it receives the next block and
realizes it missed one."" Also here: ""To facilitate this without breaking the block's hash, transactions are hashed in a Merkle Tree [7][2][5], with only the root included in the block's hash. Old blocks can then be compacted by stubbing off branches of the tree. The interior hashes do not need to be stored."" Also Figure 4 (I can tell you like the pictures...).

Segwit is not adequately described and runs counter to Figure 2. 

Awesome work. Where in the paper does it adequately describe non-mining nodes? Or mining pools? Or confidential transactions? 

C'mon... and really.. your first point is L2 solutions are against the whitepaper? What the heck does L2 have to do with the whitepaper? Bitcoin Core nodes are described by this whitepaper, not L2 stuff. Are you saying L2 shouldn't be allowed to be made because its not in the whitepaper? Wow... 

Also, the crippled 1MB limit... I don't see the limit mentioned at all in the whitepaper. I sure as shit don't see 8MB.. Stop the press, Bitcoin Cash is NOT satoshis true vision!!!!1!

Satoshi's great gift to the world was not the godamn title of the whitepaper. It was his code. Stop pointing to the cover of the book and pretending you know that the author was trying to say..."
"Again, I never stated that the white paper says all nodes need to store the whole blockchain. I stated that it shows how they should store the blockchain (as a chain of digital signatures hashed with public keys)

> it doesn't say that every node needs to validate every new block and that you can't split up the chain between nodes.

""The only way to confirm the absence of a transaction is to
be aware of all transactions....

""To accomplish this without a trusted party, transactions must be
publicly announced [1], and we need a system for participants to agree on a single history of the
order in which they were received. The payee needs proof that at the time of each transaction, the
majority of nodes agreed it was the first received. ""

That sounds like a node has to verify each transaction to me. "
"What are you on about? Sharding doesn't even exist yet properly. 

Do you mean full blockchain, as apposed to full blocks?!"
"For your second point, reference the second paragraph of the [ABC announcement](https://www.bitcoinabc.org/bitcoin-abc-medium-term-development). This collaboration of developers needs to be verified, I have yet to check the listserv and slack to see and hope to hear directly from the other teams as well. 

There is also a Jan fork planned to create a new address format to avoid people from sending BTC to BCH and vise versa that I really want to see all teams sign off on since a nearly permanent change. 

An address change is not in the white paper though nor does it fundamentally change how Bitcoin works. I need to research segwit more myself to better understand all the implications in what it changes. "
"I do that basically for btcpop already...  
I've a storage cluster with GlusterFS in replicated distribution mode so Data is stored on several nodes.  
If you code a own node you could still present the full data to the outer world but get it in real time from other nodes connected with sharding to your node.  
Probably there could even be a flag what shows other sharding nodes that you use sharding and only be compatible to other nodes who don't support it.  
I don't say its the best way but pretty sure it would work when i setup 4 nodes with sharding and those get data you request from each other.  
For non sharding nodes your sharding node would just proxy the missing data what is requested.  
You sharding node could also just not send data it doesn't have and your node would request it from another node who has the requested data and still you could run nodes what has all data local.  
But for now there isn't even a prospal as far as I know and sharding is one of the possible options for the future where no one is developing on yet.  

I think there can be a lot more on chain optimizing for better storage and data transfer between nodes."
Doubt it, as it would break protocol. Other nodes need to be able to access and send the information you need if you were running a sharded node. At the moment, as far as I know, they don't have the power to do this. 
"Er.. No.

Segwit as a soft fork and the concurrency of a sharded blockchain aren't related in any way. 

Segwit deals with transaction malleabillity and block size increase.

Sharding deals with increasing performance by not having everyone know everything at all times.

Your car analogy is deeply flawed. A better way would be to say. If segwit means that roughly 12% of drivers leave their keys in the ignition then why aren't we seeing an explosion in car theft rates.

Segwit hasn't been exploited in any way on BCH since bch split before segwit was activated and don't have any segwit code active.

12% of all bitcoin transactions are segwit. That's an enormous amount of money. If segwit is flawed why isn't anyone stealing it? Now is the perfect time. As time goes by more and more actors on the bitcoin chain will have their funds in segwit transactions meaning that damage to the system is damage to yourself. But right now you could likely cash out while killing segwit, if possible. So why isn't it happening? Could it be that segwit isn't insecure and isn't a bad thing? I certainly think so."
"Only if its the only mode...   
If you can configure node to run in full storage,pruned or sharding mode then not.  
You could probably now already develop such solution with your own nodes what will still work with the network.  "
"Any arguments you make about concurrency can be equally applied if not more so to segwit as a soft fork. 

>Also why isn't segwit under attack if it's flawed

That's like asking why you haven't gotten into a car accident if you aren't a perfect driver. 

I thought the Segwit flaw did get exploited, on BCH?"
Yes it would be nice and in theory can work. It just changes the way nodes behave with respect to the white paper. 
"I don't see it as a large flaws since nodes won't accept any of those transactions. It's also advantageous for miners to detect other miners invalid blocks.

Sharding leads to concurrency issues and concurrency is really hard to formally prove. And if anyone plans on splitting the chain without formal proof they're kinda mad.

Also why isn't segwit under attack if it's flawed. BCH would become the leading chain in a heartbeat if segwit was brought down."
Woohoo!
"Then it would be pretty nice if it works.  
Reducing storage needs and better than pruned node where old data is just lost."
"I've to read more about it.  
As I understand it so far it would be more like a storage cluster.  
You as example store a part of a file and i another, if i need info of the other part i contact your node and you contact my node for the other part.  
Ofc it needs high redundancy to avoid data going lost but same time there will be nodes who store all data.  
If all would switch now to pruned mode then all old data would be lost but many will always run nodes with full data."
No, it's storing parts of the blockchain locally, and requesting information when needed from other nodes, who store other sections of the blockchain. Similar to how torrents work. It's sharding with respect to the blockchain, not individual blocks. 
"What kind. And be realistic here. 

There are currently billions to be made by breaking segwit and still no one has done it. If there is a vulnerability why isn't it used? Are there no smart hackers?

You're spreading FUD.

Sharding is incredibly dangerous if you end up in inconsistent states. Concurrent databases are very hard to get right."
"But as far as I understand sharding is a different beast entirety. AFAIK it has to do with miners mining multiple sets of transactions concurrently. 

It's cool but also very scary."
"If I understand Sharding correct then full blocks but not as every block is full. :-)  
You store as example part 1 of a block and I store part 2 if you need info from part 2 of the block you request it from my node and vice versa.  
Ofc it could also be done like you storing block 1 and me block 2 and someone else block 3.  
And as it doesn't exists yet we've to wait till it exists and is tested but even then many would still run nodes with the full data as now many do even when pruned mode exists."
Segwit (especially implemented as a soft fork) introduces a security vulnerability that sharding does not. 
"I don't see pruning as the devil ( and never did I even had nodes running in pruned mode ).  
It just allows more people to verify their own transactions if they want to without needing to store all the data.  
There will be still nodes storing all data like now with some running in pruned mode.  "
"> Sharding is incredibly dangerous

Ok, evidence of that? 

**Since we are being reasonable,** here are some sources that adequately demonstrate that major security flaw with Segwit as currently implemented:

No. If you are CS educated you should have enough understanding of LNs to see that there is no trusted middle man. If trust is needed LN is just a regular exchange and wouldn't need the malleabillity fix or this much development. Think. 
"That is oh so irrelevant it only further supports the post you responded too...

Literally, that's the point. Sharding isn't in the whitepaper (although it does mention what would happen if nodes are missing blocks and the solution in the paper isn't ""thats fine we've sharded them""). Niether is segwit. Oh, are you about to say ""but it breaks the chain of digital signatures!!""... That would certainly be against the whitepaper, if it were true, but its not. Segwit blocks contain ALL the necessary signatures... It's only out of date nodes that no longer have a chain of signatures (protip: update your node for compliance with the whitepaper).

Again, its all irrelevant. The whitepaper is great, but it was out of date while satoshi was still with us. Pretending it is anything but an historical document is a game played by fools and propagandists."

BTC is trustless, lightning is trustless."
"It does state how nodes verify transactions. It's states directly how they should do this, and how the chain should be stored. 

Indeed, as r/BTC quotes so often, it also states where the full chain should be stored. 

Sharding would fundamentally change of all this. "
Ah come on, you know full well what he is referring to, you just can't admit it, and nor can 70% of the people here. 
"So let me get this right.

If you like something, then it is ok no matter what. If you don't like something, then nothing else matters.

Did I sum it up well?

You don't want black and white thinking, but all I see on this sub are references to 'spirit of the white paper' and 'original vision' - as if anyone has any idea about either of those things. Shitting on other team all day long, using same memes all the time. Conspiracy theories everywhere, interpreting things that other people say through some prism of righteousness. Don't you see the problem there?

It's like CSW giving shit to Bitcoin for Blockstream involvement, while at the same time pushing the money line on his own twitter. Just like applying for dozens/hundreds of patents, while giving shit to Blockstream for a single patent. I mean, fuck Blockstream, I don't care about them. But hypocrisy drives me mad.

And who decides what is in the 'spirit of the whitepaper' (as if it's a bible)? You? Roger Ver? Fake Satoshi? I don't see sharding as being in the spirit of the whitepaper. Why do you think your opinion is more valuable? I am sure that Satoshi would let us all know what he really wanted, if he cared. Since he doesn't - what makes you think that you, Roger Ver, Craig Wright or anyone else, is supposed to carry the torch? Maybe this is exactly what he wanted for Bitcoin. To die so something better can take its place. We should go to Satoshi church and wait for an answer. No wonder everyone is starting to fork their own version of Bitcoin. Everyone has different idea of what the 'original vision' was, or what is in the 'spirit of the white paper'. But somehow BTG is a scam, while BCH is the second Jesus coming. Right. Both are the same shit. Forks with ulterior motives.

I laughed today at 'mid-term plan' for BCH. If that is the plan for the future, future is bleak. I laugh at CSW talking about Confidential Transactions now. As if he suddenly discovered a fucking wheel.

And why is re-enabling some disabled op-codes now not an issue? They were disabled for a reason. It doesn't seem to be 'in the spirit of the white paper'. Satoshi would maybe not agree to it, eh? For example, even Gavin used to say things like this:

*""before enabling new opcodes, I'd like to see a peer-reviewed academic-style paper that works through the security implications of the existing set of opcodes and gives a nice framework for thinking about new (or disabled old) opcodes.""*

But apparently, it's no biggie when BCH wants to do it. I guess we'll see peer-reviewed academic-style paper for reactivated opcode(s) - right?

BCH hypocrisy is what really puts me off. If people are honest and say ""we're in this just for the money"", I would have no problem with it.

But pretending how this is all being done for some noble cause is the worst of all. I know little of Bitcoin 'Core' team or stories behind it (I learn all the gossip from here), I have actually been following/reading BCH much much more - because you guys are loud as fuck, but no matter how much I want to like the project, it is impossible. You also allowed creeps to represent you. You might see them as some knights on white horses, but not many businesses or professionals will want to be associated with them. Do you understand how much of impact that can/will have on BCH? Roger Ver. Craig Wright. John McAfee. Calvin Ayre. Rick Falkvinge. This is what people see when they look for info on BCH. Next thing they see is the endless drama. Noone, at that point, gives anymore a flying fuck about transactions per second or 'spirit of the white paper'.

I pretty much hate both fucking groups by now, you are both destroying Bitcoin. But this cult pretends to have a moral high-ground, which is very very very annoying."
This is brilliant!
"It is basically like a cache. The older the data or the less frequent it is used, the less likely it is stored on the local node and therefore the node will have to retrieve some of the older ""shards"" to get the relevant data. 
This is a very elegant way of securing scalability while keeping a high number of nodes on the network :-) 
"
[deleted]
"Lots of words but no actual arguments made for SegWit, interesting. Maybe you need to take a hard look at your own positions? From a quick read of the link you sent, it appears all the actual benefits can be done without SegWit.

For example, BCH actually fixed quad hashing for all transactions on day one, whereas BTC only fixed it for SegWit transactions so it is still an attack vector via non SegWit transactions.

You claiming that ASIC versus CPU mining is a fundamental change to Bitcoin is disengenuous. I could use paper and pencil and try to mine a block, and if I succeeded and broadcast it to the network, it would be valid as it follows the rules in how Bitcoin was setup to work and in no way change anything."
I don't think it was gavin at all, but I also can't find any sources, they're all more recent news about eth. If some other cryptohistorian could chime in here that would be great.
Similarly, the current DAA also only looks at already mined blocks.
Yeah I love it!
"I'm so baffled by everything you wrote I don't know what to write. Miners mine what's profitable. They aren't the only ones deciding value.

So are you saying that people who disagree with ABC are out? So they are the new reference developers. O jeez. Feel sorry for bitcoin cash"
"Alright, there are 9 items on that list that explains the problem and how segwit affects them.  Can you enlighten me and point me to similar documentation on how Bcash proposes to address or has addressed each one, how and why that method was chosen?

I'm not saying that switching that ASIC is a fundamental change to Bitcoin... I'm saying that treating the whitepaper as a bible is a bad idea.  If you do treat it as a bible, then you treat it as a bible and everything Satoshi said should be treat as the word of god.  That is essentially your argument for why Segwit is bad... because there is something in the whitepaper that might indicate Satoshi thought it was a bad idea almost a decade ago.  So either treat the whitepaper like its the word of god, which means you need to switch to a PoW algorithm that is only viable with a CPU... or realize the whitepaper is just a starting place and agree that everything in the whitepaper is possible to change, except for perhaps what is strictly in the title ""peer to peer electronic cash system""  Segwit or no segwit, both Bitcoin and Bcash are an electronic cash system."
Okay so one guy says they are enemies.  Last I checked this is a decentralized system.  I personally disagree that larger blocks are a problem.  I also don't think that larger blocks will solve all problems either... its just delaying some of them.  So... I don't see any point in talking about this since I'm not, and never have, made a claim that I think larger blocks are a problem.
"Thanks for the explanation.

It does start to look very like Bittorrent the way everyone shares different bits of the blockchain and the whole thing is therefore available in the ""swarm"".

And you cache what you need. Presumably we'll have ""hot"" data which nearly everyone has, consisting of the last X number of blocks etc.

Reduces storage, increases bandwidth.  I think that is the smart way to go as the chain scales.  "
"Sharding is good computer science, SegWit isn't. So there is that. This is a programming and economic experiment, the moral high ground has nothing to do with it.

But the devil is in the details. We will see."
"Please explain this in detail.

How can segwit, a reorganization of a block, be worse than splitting the chain into multiple shards?

Enter the real world and you see more moderate core supporters most of whom are fine with some onchain scaling but understand its not the final solution nor should we hastily rush into it or allow a corporate gathering to dictate Bitcoin's future."
"Where does the whitepaper say ""Sharding not allowed""?

It's pretty easy tho to find stuff about why a ""peer to peer electronic cash""  is not compatible with 1mb blocks or lightning network and this store of value garbage.

"Point 8, SPV, talks about how end user nodes don't need every block and should jus contact nodes with the rest of the chain.

Sharding is pretty similar to SPV just that it's a node<>node trust relationship instead of user<>node.

Do you have the text where the whitepaper says ""every node needs to store the complete blockchain""?

The whitepaper only talks about the ongoing blockchain, but never about how it needs to be stored on nodes."

Really?  Because to me it just sounds like blowing smoke up each other's asses.  It's a 6 month roadmap, which is really quite short for a project like this and it doesn't even say anything about what will actually be activated just some random thoughts about what they might do.  All of those features need to be implemented in all implementations and tested in time to all be compatible by the activation date. 6 months is not enough time for this.  I guarantee what will go live is hardly anything at all, this causes a chain split, or bugs are introduced that crash nodes.
Came to say this.  I've really missed this type of conversation.  
Maybe they’ll actually test their code for off-by-one errors and not crash the Blockchain this time

Is there something about segwit you think makes it bad, aside from that Bitcoin has it while bcash doesn't?
"> Canonical transaction ordering solves transaction malleability right?

3rd party malleability was already fixed with the last patches.

Canonical ordering is to enable Graphene-blocks, which eliminates 94% of the network traffic needed to communicate that a block has been found. It's incredible.

Clogging the network with found blocks being communicated node to node is one of the main argument Core always used as to why we can't scale on-chain and need segwit/Lightning. In one fell swoop, Gavin destroyed that argument with Graphene."
This team putting this out really makes me see BCH is going to be the future.

"> Everyone keeps saying Median Time Past. But what does it mean?

It's basically the timestamp of the 6th block below the topmost block, for all practical purposes.

Think of it as the blockchain's notion of time.. after 6 confirmations.  So you know it's unlikely to change.  But it likely an hour behind..  because it's 6 blocks ago.

"
"> move towards adaptive block size limit

Just worried about spam attacks from detractors at that point. I suppose miners will always have final say on what gets into a block in either case.

> Like First In First Out?

Not likely, nodes receive transactions at different times and thus different orders. More likely is to order by transaction ID which is a random number."
How does first-in-first-out work in a global network with possible latency causing one transaction originating in the USA to show up behind another in China? Or one block to show up in the USA before China? That's why median time past is used: to make time observations on the blockchain even against bad or downright malicious timestamps in a block.
"> Like First In First Out? 

No. First in first out would simply be a mining policy, but it doesn't really matter if blocks aren't full.

Removing the transaction ordering rule would mean that *within* a block, depndent transactions do not have to be preceded by the transactions they depent on. This means that you could simply order the transactions by hash."
"> Everyone keeps saying Median Time Past. But what does it mean?

Median Time Past is the median of the timestamps of the previous 11 blocks.

It's a consensus rule that the timestamp of a block must be greater than the median timestamp of the previous 11 blocks. So this means that MTP is guaranteed to always monotonically increase."
Median Time Past is the timestamp of the median of a range of blocks. (MTP-11 would be the median of the last 11 blocks)

I have difficulties to see why this can be needed and how it compares to an ""unlimited"" limit.

As I understand it, this means that the limit will be decreased if blocks are empty and increase if they are full. Why not just keep a high limit? If there is 500KB worth of transaction in a block, it doesn't matter if the max is 8MB or 400MB."

Not really. The security in terms of hashpower on  each block is a million times more than it was originally, but we still consider the first blocks immutable. The security comes more from the network validation of the block and then subsequent use of that block's hash to make new blocks.

Activating Segwit is not the hard part but there are better ways to achieve what Segwit is doing so there is no real need for it.

Spam transactions are useless against such large blocks so no minimum fees should be necessary, in fact they are talking about having a guaranteed space in blocks for zero fee txs.
I don't think you can have FIFO, every nodes mempool is likely different, if not unique, so you would have to trust each node, which you can't because they will, and should, choose what transactions to include that profits them the most.
I am struggling to understand how order by a random number would be considered ordered - wont that just be a random sort?
"For transactions getting into a block, I don't think it matters if there's a 20 seconds latency difference between USA, China or wherever. But if the current block is full (which probably wouldn't happen often if there's good spare capacity) then some guy that transmitted their transaction 1 minute after the last block should get in rather than some guy that committed a transaction 9 minutes after the last block and paid a higher fee to get in and push the 1 minute guy into the next block.

ABC has compact blocks. It doesn't have XThin as the current implementation in BU has code quality problems and nobody worked on a high quality implementation.
Bobtail could improve this.
"People that wait for confirmations don't necessarily wait for 6 confirmations, even just 1 confirmation is better than 0 confirmation: intentionally orphaning blocks always costs money. A shorter block interval allows people to accept a security level between current 0-conf and current 1-conf.

"0-conf is fine, but some confirmation is still better than no confirmation at all. Shorter block intervals allows merchants that do need confirmation to choose more precisely how much confirmation they want; in wallets it would basically offer a more smooth progress bar for the confirmation."
I don't have to dig. It was a safe bet (guess) then. No reason to keep it for the same reason we don't keep the 1MB limit anymore.
The one downside I can think of is that if you have transactions that have an order dependency they will have to be included in separate blocks, whereas currently they could make it into the same block.

"I don't think this is true.

There is a difference between *canonical ordering* and removing the order constraint.

Graphene could use a canonical order today without any changes in consensus rules. You just define an order, e.g. by hash and dependent transactions after their dependency, and require that for blocks that use graphene.

Removing the ordering constraint means that you no longer require dependent transactions to come after the transactions they depend on. 

This makes a canonical order easier (just order by hash), and as some additional advantages in terms of parallelization."

This has been discussed since day one. If you dig into old Satoshi posts, you will understand why Satoshi chose 10 minutes block

I hope the downvotes are mainly from Core shills who want no competition or from non-developers. Otherwise, I bet on faster coins like ETH, DASH, (insert any coin here except BTC) becoming more popular than BCH.
Since security is created by the number hashes (i.e. amount of energy) required to find a new block, then moving to 2 minute blocks simply means you have to wait for 30 blocks (or 60 minutes) to get the same level of security as 6 blocks with 10 minute block times, correct?

It's some method of making it where there is no actual hard-cap to block size.

It's basically unlimited block size, except with something approximating an sanity check. Previously it was some vote the miners made on each block that can increase the size. Though I believe basic mining incentives already provide a limit on what miners will want to do.

Exodus does not hold your private keys or any of your private info at all. They are hidden in your asset specific file folders.
i would check Stash wallet for android. btc,bch,eth, and maybe some others.
You should probably educate yourself first if this is what you're posting
Keep going. The downvotes flow as easily as Tethers.
"Right here.

I’m confused about why Bitcoin Cash ever existed when we already had cheap payments and fast transaction times with 1000’s of other shitcoins. "
"No.   Just like the ""durr its just easier to say!"" line, its childish nonsense."
wow im stupid. I searched for this before, and I found out that I could find my private key. I thought exodus had control over it for some reason. Thanks for your response either way.
I think that one is simply emotionally attached to the aspects of something one likes. And gets a bit hurt when another person doesn't care or disregards that attachement, for example by calling it by an improper name.

im talking about Roger 
"this isnt proof but come on, it's obvious that the majority of people think BTC is Bitcoin and BCH is Bitcoin Cash (aka not Bitcoin) based on things like

- Way more people being in BTC than BCH

- The names are literally Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash

Bitcoin coined the name (unintentional pun oops) and even if BCH took over, it doesnt deserve to be called Bitcoin. Not because of inferior tech or anything, not because of any personal opinions, but because Bitcoin is Bitcoin, and Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin Cash. They are what they are

"
Bitcoin is the ledger, not the chain. The Bitcoin ledger is being serviced by 2+ chains.
">  Just because we now have BCH?

Exactly.  at the 1st of August Bitcoin split into two.  The Bitcoin Cash narrative is that Bitcoin Cash follows the original Bitcoin vision and works like Bitcoin used to work, hence it's much more Bitcoin than the ""big brother Bitcoin"".  From this point of view, it's totally fair to label the other coin ""Bitcoin Core"".  After all, the Core maintainers have full control of the protocol development."
Enough emotional attachment to something that's been around for a couple of weeks to boycott a wallet, though? Seriously I'm not trying to be an asshole, but that sounds ridiculous. If people support and believe in the concept and the world wants to call it something different (not something *bad*, just something different) then why would they give a shit? How is the name such a big sticking point for BCH users? Bcash is a fine name. It's memorable enough. It's clearly a currency. Why would average users care about one name over the other as long as the coin has the features that they want?
At least /u/taipalag was kinda clever. Step it up.
Roger has no need to be on this dudes platform giving him more views or exposure than he's ever had in his life. If he doesn't want to show Roger respect Roger has no reason to continue with the conversation.  Its a pretty simple concept dude.  You're free to disrespect whoever you want but that doesn't make you free from any consequences that follow.  
"> but because Bitcoin is Bitcoin, and Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin Cash. They are what they are

I actually agree with this personally. I just have a hard time saying ""the majority"" feels any way with how much obfuscation there is in these communication channels. Half of the population is censored, the other half has almost no understanding of what bitcoin cash even is in relation to bitcoin. It's almost impossible to say what the majority truly thinks.

An example would be how vocal small block supporters are online. I've personally never met one in real life and most people I talk to on here haven't either. It's hard to get any real data on this stuff there is so much foul play on both sides."
"> Inferior tech

This is very clearly an opinion. It is in no way true. Right now Bitcoin Cash has superior tech. They hard forked to fix the quadratic signature hash issue and to improve the difficulty adjustment algorithm. Both of which are proving effective.

Bitcoin SegWit has SegWit. Which was done with a soft fork, so isn't fully adopted. It fixes the quadratic signature hash issue, but since it is voluntary the chain can still be attacked with this. Also, 90% of transactions still have this issue since they don't use SegWit. That means it takes longer to process transactions on Bitcoin SegWit than Bitcoin Cash. It has transaction malleability fixed, but that provides no real benefit until Lightning Network is released. It changes the block weighting of signatures vs non signature data, but this doesn't necessarily change anything either.

When Lightning Network is released, we can reevaluate which chain has superior tech. If it works Bitcoin Cash can quickly adopt it, while still having maintained functionality during its development.

I think a logical person would assume they are both Bitcoin. Which is accurate."
Consequences....like ATH’s? Those consequences?
"I don't think it is inferior tech

I meant that as in ""Im not saying this because of inferior tech""

idk a clearer way of saying this over text rn"
Lose an argument so bring up something completely irrelevant?  Classic troll.  See why no one wants to engage with trolls? Its a waste of time for people who actually value their time.  Also I have plenty of btc so I'm just as happy as anyone else at 10K.  
"Okay, well you just mentioned that in your comment, so I thought that is what you were saying. You said you didn't think that was the reason, but it still seemed like you were implying it was true. I apologize if I misinterpreted.

I still don't see how you can say Bitcoin Cash doesn't deserve to use the name Bitcoin. It is supported by more of the original developers of Bitcoin than Bitcoin SegWit."
There was no argument...Respect is earned not given, that is a fact of life regardless of your opinion.
"Bitcoin is money. Money is a ledger, and the Bitcoin ledger is BTC+BCH. The Bitcoin ledger is maintained across two separate chains right now. 

""Bitcoin"" refers to both as a whole combined ledger. The individual chains servicing that ledger are called Bitcoin Legacy and Bitcoin Cash."
bcash!  bcash?
It's not confusing.  It means Bitcoin, not Bitcoin Cash.  In the future, if Bitcoin Cash becomes the dominant coin in work and marketcap, we can reconsider the names.  That will not be up to any one person or even group of people.  It will just happen organically.  Certainly Bitcoin Cash is the original vision of Bitcoin, but Bitcoin has moved on and like it or not, it deserves the name it has.  For now.
Why? It's been called Bitcoin since genesis block, why change it now? Just because we now have BCH?
[deleted]
"Many times it's pretty eerie how similar /r/bitcoin and /r/btc arguments can be against each if all you do is replace a few possibly insult intended phrases for the other. Even the arguments for why it isn't an insult is similar.

It's better to take the high road as opposed to stooping to their level. The only groups who applaud it are those who are firmly on one side, but newcomers will just see immaturity and go towards other options available. The goal is to expand. The intent shouldn't be to start rallying around a specific coin like it's a sports team, and make it an if you aren't with us you are against us type mentality. 
"
"I don't want to sound rude but both subs are so fucking hypocrites, like how come we can't call BCH bcash (when everyone's here is saying how this sub is not censored, free to discuss) and on the other all I see is segwitcoin; shitcoin, segcoin... Hypocrites "
It's Bitcoin Core. And Segwit Coin is reasonable in some instances it uses a different address format and has a different security model.

That's confusing though. Bitcoin could mean either bitcoin core or bitcoin cash.

The primary things I've read about the topic have agreed with what I said, am I just missing the other side of the argument? "
">it's not bitcoin when it was designed specifically to be bitcoin seems unfair

It's not Bitcoin, Bitcoin is Bitcoin. Bitcoin has the original blockchain that Satoshi created, it has the continuous history back to that first block. It has a market value that reflects that. This is a new coin. It is not Bitcoin. It doesn't matter if it's unfair. If I designed a new coin that was exactly what Satoshi had envisioned but *I* was the one who designed it and Satoshi's initial Bitcoin was still in existence why would I get to call mine Bitcoin? It's a clone

>saying it's not an affiliate of bitcoin makes no sense, how would you affiliate with a protocol

Exactly. You can't affiliate with a protocol, but you can make people *think* that you're affiliated, thus gaining their confidence in your brand and greatly increasing their willingness to become a part of the ecosystem. That's what I believe the point of the namebrand association is. Calling something Bitcoin Cash makes new/inexperienced/tech stupid users believe that the two are somehow related. This is not debatable, this is how humans work. The two are not related and if a person buys BCH they are not interacting with Bitcoin in any way, shape, or form. They are interacting with BCH. "
It's a personal boycott
Reddit isn’t the entire crypto community... but to be honest i’m having trouble making sense of your post in general. Genuinely not trying to be mean, it’s probably my fault.
If someone does not give you the respect you ask for in polite conversation you have no need to continue the discussion or return respect.  That is a 100% libertarian ideal but I'm sure you probably know very little about crypto or libertarianism aka 'voluntarism'. 
Lol how did I avoid the point? Voting with your wallet isn't any form of censorship. You clearly have no understanding of what Libertarianism actually is.
"Do you have evidence of what the majority thinks? 

We clearly state Bitcoin Cash is our name. We have a separate chain and replay protection. What gives one group of developers exclusive rights to the name? In my opinion they took control of the name and are misusing it and misleading people about what Bitcoin is. "
"> The majority don't think BCH is Bitcoin

Prove it.

Your statements are wrong, not your question. If you don't understand a wallet, you shouldn't be putting your money in it. Do more research before putting your money somewhere.

"Somehow we're supposed to accept that BCash is a grave insult but calling /r/bitcoin and core supporters **North Koreans** is perfectly acceptable.

"I love how this sub preaches about how the more usable coin will win out, but then they simultaneously admit that without Bitcoin explicitly in the name, their coin is just another worthless altcoin.

All companies should stick to the official names, Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, including that BCH supporting companies should not use Bitcoin Core for Bitcoin. Newcomers are lost enough without having to deal with confusion about the names of the cryptos.

Yep, any services calling it BCash will be boycotted. Either they are really that ignorant or just deliberately trying to antagonize Bitcoin Cash users. Either way, it reflects very badly on them.
I totally agree and that is why I stopped using Bitfinnex.
">deliberately trying to antagonize Bitcoin Cash users

Why would Bitcoin Cash users give a shit? Why would *any* average user give consciously a shit what the name of their crypto is? The reason the guys who made the thing get pissy is because they want to piggy back on Bitcoin's name recognition. It has nothing to do with being ""closer to the true Bitcoin"".

"> How is near unanimous support known?

It sounds hard (and it is hard to achieve) but it is actually quite simple, it is the absence of opposition.  A good example from recent history is the Bitcoin Cash hard fork to fix the EDA, it had near unanimous support so it just went through.

Bitcoin has actually done that several times already with soft forks already but it is getting harder and harder as time goes by.

> I do not support the notion that there must be one winner

Neither do I, it is certainly never a position I have maintained.

I am not terribly keen on them either, I put them in the same bucket as the bch supporters who want to destroy bitcoin.  As far as I am concerned BCH is your guy's coin and I don't have the right to tare it down, I do wish the sentiment was replicated by all parties but it is not something I can force on people."

Good for you. We aren’t comparing how good we are at timing the market and trading. Bitcoin is less volatile so of course BCH had more of a dip... look at the bchbtc chart. We can compare all sorts of different timescales and it would be a pointless conversation. Right now it’s proving to not be a better investment for most of us who sold at the beginning and forgot about it.

"Ya dude, I've chatted with you before.  You are so far in outer space, I'm good.  I'm not reading your profile and you just wasted your buck fifty.

I'm not on a team, but you certainly are, and that's enough for me."
"How is near unanimous support known?

As user-base increases, it's statistically less likely for near unanimous support, as there will be competing use case priorities. Forks are in my mind, expected, and welcome... once a divide is strong enough to viably support a fork, and such a fork has meaningful differentiating features, it is virtually inevitable.

I do not support the notion that there must be one winner... that's essentially censorship. Kind of like declaring that there is one superior race. Each is unique.

This is why I dislike a subset of the BTC crowd who calls BCH a scam. It is not a scam. Adding segwit was a change. Making bigger blocks was a change. One had the majority, one had the minority (but still valid). I also like a subset of the BCH crowd who says BCH is ""the real"" bitcoin. Both are bitcoin; both have adapted. Maybe both of them are honey badgers in their own right."
Nice strawman argument.
So every fork will have the name Bitcoin, I guess thats bad for bcash
"I know it's hard to wrap your head around but every fork of a project has claim to the name as long as it's not trademarked. In other words every single fork of bitcoin (including diamond, gold and so on) __is__ Bitcoin. 

Otherwise it wouldn't be a decentralised platform. Someone could easily hijack github repo, mess up the code and force the community into a fork. So that means now the project would have to be permanently renamed? That's ridiculous.

Every Bitcoin fork is Bitcoin, doesn't matter if it's good or bad."

Even if it was still at .2 I wouldn’t give a shit. It’s not that different but I’m not holding a shit coin. "

It wasn't actually.  Satoshi had good reason to put it in place and to pick the numbers he did.  Those reasons still have not dissipated but we are taking them one by one (slowed by the very change resistant process we are talking about).

But yeah, I agree it is frustrating at times and of late we have seen a lot of new blood that is attracted by the price of bitcoin (instead of the value) and it is somewhat understandable that they think that we should just do anything we can to increase the price without taking the value of bitcoin into account."

Yea this is fine to me.

Now if a guy is saying that because he thinks it gets under my skin, then that's different because that guy is being a passive aggressive asshole. I'll still support his right to say whatever he wants how and how he wants to say it, but I don't have to like him or keep talking to him.

Well yeah clearly not one or the other. There many people here with different view points. This group is more inclusive than /r/bitcoin because there's no censorship.

I have nothing against BTC because there are alternatives for other use case that BTC doesn't cover... such as digital cash. ;) (at least for now)

Aren't soft forks kind of stealthy? Like, legacy nodes have no clue segwit exists for example, right? Doesn't that effectively mean that there cannot be enforced opposition for a soft fork?

I'm having trouble finding examples of hard forks in the BTC history.

I just came across refetence of an error of 92 Billion BTC magically appearing, which included a roll-back in the chain history. (Technically a hard fork?) This surprises me, since I've heard some Bitcoin fans point fingers at Ethereum for rolling back their chain.

The only hard forks I've seen that make a change that is not a fix to a catastrophic bug, have resulted in chain splits, and therefore new coins. Is that the case? And if so... is BTC ever going to be able to do a successful hard fork for an improvement? Or will there only be soft forks, and catastrophic bug fixes?


Also, on a more philosophical note... isn't it a good thing that BCH test out on-chain scaling? If it succeeds or fails, it will help BTC make an informed decision about such a hard fork in the future. BCH as a result, may actually be one of the most critical things to ensure the long term survival of BTC."
"> I want nothing to do with that guy who brags about being a millionaire 

Cool, nobody force you to be involved in BCH.

You seem to prefer BTC as it is now, what the problem?

"Actually, it does. Most of Bitcoin was built before ""Core"" got involved and introduced Segwit, RBF and economic experiments like the so-called ""fee market"". 

In other words, Bitcoin ran fine for years before ""Core"" got involved, funded by Blockstream who got their money from banks and VC funds. "
Ok well that’s your conspiracy theory opinion and I disagree. 
Well its actually not clearly Bitcoin anymore as it has soft forked from the whitepaper, whilst BCH actually fits the original ideas presented. So Bitcoin actually refers more to BCH than Bitcoin-Legacy.
"What you are is a simpleton who simply cannot comprehend that the technology is complex, that the world Bitcoin is trying to change is also complex, and that the challenges to overcome IF we are to succeed are, you guessed it, complex too. And because you cannot wrap your simple mind around that, you cannot comprehend that the solutions will **NECESSARILY** be complex. The end users will not be required to know anything about that complexity, and enjoy an extremely simple and pleasant experience. Yet, to get there will require complex solutions. And increasing the block size does not even scratch the surface of complexity.

We are not streaming hi definition videos today because we have bigger pipes. We stream hi definition videos MAINLY because videos are smaller, they are compressed. This compression is complex, and without it there would be no hi definition porn to wank to. You may wanna think about it."
It's not even a tactic. It's just natural for people to expect other human beings to do the same as they would have done themselves (if they were in the same situation). Perhaps it's a form of [psychological projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_projection)?
"> They are all about oral artistry

There's a lot to it and there are indeed debate techniques, oral methods and whatnot, but you can be aware of it the same way you can be aware of any sort of argumenting techniques and tricks.  

I think debating, even with these pitfalls, still can be a very useful medium for the community. "
I think you’re confused. How can Bcash be a pump and dump if it’s not out yet? You are referring to [Bcash](https://medium.com/@freetrade68/announcing-bcash-8b938329eaeb) which is completely different from Bitcoin Cash. 
Bitcoin is Bitcoin Legacy + Bitcoin Cash. It splitted. If you are in denial about it, it's not my problem
Exactly. And what have you done to alleviate the issue? A big deliberate nothing.
"No offence taken. I don't think you even need to go to the back of a napkin to determine on-chain scaling to visa level (and beyond) is a little (a lot) crazy.

Transaction capacity with on-chain BTC/BCH does not increase as you throw more computers at it. It's all just replicated work. So... is it reasonable for one computer to handle visa level transactions right now? Eh... probably not....

I'm all for layer 2 scaling solutions. It seems silly to record purchases for coffee or tips for some funny comment on Reddit to be recorded on the world's most redundant and secure storage medium ever invented.

I do think though, that user perception of bitcoin could be damaged long term due to the current transaction limit (which arguably is not even close to stressing even a mediocre 5 year old computer running a full node). Once it becomes common sentiment that bitcoin has high fees, or not all transactions go through, it will probably take quite a while for those perceptions to shift.

It seems that a sensible path forward is to utilize the existing (naive) scaling for now, since it should be able to handle a 10x increase in the near term, allowing a continued pleasant user experience. But definitely absolutely still work on layer 2 scaling solutions that will go the next order of magnitude, or two. If LN is viable and operational in 1 year, there wouldn't be pressure to go to a 50MB or 100MB block. If it works really well, maybe the block could be reduced to 5MB or 500KB at that time.

Edit: wording."
"I didn’t say it failed although I do think you have an very rich benefactor who is buying up lots of BCH which is pumping the price up. Either way what I’m saying is I sold around .17 so it makes no difference to me right now. 

I don’t have a problem with BCH just how people are projecting that it is bitcoin and all this other nonsense. Like roger just had a huge fit over what? Someone calling it bcash? I only come here because there is no actual conversation about btc or rbitcoin. I mean good luck to BCH but it’s not cool when you guys start spreading lies and actively say you want to destroy bitcoin (core). "
"What can I do?  I have no idea why you cant understand what I am writing.

"> This comical logic means that Bitcoin Gold and Bitcoin Diamond have just the same right to call themselves the ""real"" bitcoin as Bitcoin Cash.

Both Bitcoin Gold and Bitcoin Diamond are a fork of Bitcoin (Core), hence use Segwit and aren't a chain of digital signatures anymore, so they obviously are at the same level as Bitcoin (Core) and can't be called the real Bitcoin as per Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper. That's flawless logic, sorry. Your logic is comical.

> The funny part is that I'd even argue that Bitcoin Gold is a better altcoin than Bitcoin Cash. It's got an asic resistant mining algorithm. That's at least something.

Are you serious? Is that your quality criteria? Bitcoin Gold is premined, their wallet stole customer funds, at a time part of the fees went directly in the pocket of the developers, and so on.

BTW asic resistance doesn't prevent that economies of scale will still lead to centralization pressure. You'll just end up with pools of NVidia graphic cards instead of pools of Bitmain miners in the same places where electricity is cheap.

> The reality is that all three of these forks are a joke and will never threaten Bitcoin.

"**Psychological projection**

Psychological projection is a theory in psychology in which humans defend themselves against their own unconscious impulses or qualities (both positive and negative) by denying their existence in themselves while attributing them to others. For example, a person who is habitually intolerant may constantly accuse other people of being intolerant. It incorporates blame shifting.

According to some research, the projection of one's unconscious qualities onto others is a common process in everyday life.

I think both of them have very fair points, but both act immaturely.
But bitcoin cash is also bitcoin so how do we differentiate the 2 forks?
Decentralised means there is no “official” anything. The market decides what to call it. I’d agree that flipping someone off in a blind rage for not agreeing with you is immature.
Ok I’m not going to keep explaining simple math to you.... you pick an arbitrary point to start this graph and of course it looks good. This called cherry picking and if you were being honest with yourself you know this graph doesn’t explain what really happened. I can tell you haven’t taken simple college level math classes btw. This is not a hard concept to understand. 
Pretty sure that this was after Roger flipped him off. Nice to pick and choose though. They were both kind of ridiculous in this interview. I think he did acknowledge that the name is Bitcoin Cash, but it's easier to say bcash. Truth be told I PREFER the name Bcash as well, because it sounds better - not to offend anyone, but because it sounds better to me. Is this an inclusive group or an easily offended group that ostracizes anyone that doesn't conform?
Being offended is fucking stupid. Sorry but it is.

If you would do that more I would appreciate it. Like you really did a great job on the Tom Woods show. Granted Tom is very respectful. 

You gave them ammo as well. It's like you are competing with Dr Pepper by making Dr Thunder. You're clearly using ""Dr"" to ride on the coattails. That's fine. It's smart even.

He was saying it to troll you though which was awful to do to your guest. Fuck that guy. 

But insulting his net worth was really fucking low on the ad hominem totem poll. Idk man. You just rubbed me the wrong way. I'll still hold your coin either way tho. 

That's just my opinion though. I'm not a ""self-made millionaire"" yet. Give me two weeks. Lol. I wasn't sure if you were the real deal until you talked on Tom Woods show. Now I'm unsure again. If I feel this way, think what serious investors are thinking. Time for a look in the mirror and a meditation break like Tim Ferris recommends.

"> Aren't soft forks kind of stealthy?

A bit, because you are not adding any rules to bitcoin with soft forks you don't need that near unanimous support.  The catch 22 part of that is because you are not adding any rules to bitcoin you cannot make anyone use your soft fork.

So, even though they are 'stealthy' since they are optional individual users can decide if they want to use them or not.

> I'm having trouble finding examples of hard forks in the BTC history.

There has actually only been one when Satoshi put the 1 MB in place and Satoshi did that by himself and no one noticed until days later (some still call it a soft fork though).

The 92 billion bitcoin was actually fixed with a soft fork after the rollback.  There was also a bug in 2013 that caused a major rollback but that was fixed by everyone agreeing to roll to the old chain and fix the bug in the newer bitcoin software later.

Several soft forks also disabled most of the original scripting system because of bugs as well as add features like multisig.

> Also, on a more philosophical note... isn't it a good thing that BCH test out on-chain scaling? 

Being philosophical (please don't take offence): Bitcoin Cash is its own thing and there is not really anything for bitcoin to learn from it.  It's chosen path to scale is somewhat limited and won't get us to the world dominating currency status that we are really after without significant centralisation (if at all).

We want billions of daily transactions as soon as possible and even a simple 'back of the napkin' calculation shows you that just bumping up the block size is not going to do it.  Just to take on visa levels blocks need to be hundreds of gigabytes."

Calls himself a libertarian and starts crying and threatens to sue people when someone calls bitcoin cash bcash. Pure white hipster trash right there.
"I only hold Bitcoin, but that doesn't mean I can't see that it is broken as to how it is unintended to work.

There is almost no point in owning many other cryptos since you have to go through Bitcoin to buy into anything else.  Most people trade to only beat USD evaluation but you need to be trading to beat BTC valuation.

I make some swings here and there and have small long term positions.  However if I wanted to actually use a cryptocurrency BTC is by far the worst option.

Once BCH has trading pairs to a large number of alt coins on a large platform with acceptable volume and its vision is more clear in the long run then I might consider switching to strictly BCH.  For now though I trade in and out of BCH to accumulate BTC.

It just sucks when I can't send people $1 worth of BTC in a wallet I want them to create to show them how it works, instead I have to tell them how there is internal conflict amongst bitcoin and then it goes down this long road.

The average person continues to ask me is it cheap to use bitcoin and I am not going to lie which then opens up other questions.  I don't really trust the devs of BTC as I have researched into them as to where they went to university and what businesses / companies they have worked for and what major ties they have.

When BTC has direct ties to the Bilderberg group it really questions what motives they have to attach themselves to the very people BTC initially claimed to avoid.

However I am not trading on ideologies or emotions either and I understand brand recognition and It's apparent why BCH wants to take over the name Bitcoin.  When something is stolen from you generally the natural response is to claim it back.

Anyway I am rambling, but if anyone brings up any points and all their entire reasoning is ""Roger Ver is a criminal"" thats a pretty closed minded view on the entire cryptosphere, especially when we all initially got in there was no such thing.  Now to only resort to character assassination of ONE PERSON, on a project that is supported by alot of people its baffling.

I also don't think it is crazy to spend bitcoins on minor things like food and necessities, I want to spend my crypto, I want to be able to show people you can spend crypto, I want to be hyped like it once was.  I have personally paid a $70 and two $30 USD transactions on amounts $600 and lower before I knew exactly how wallets worked, with any other coin you do not have to currently do that, that is unacceptable and will not help spread mass adoption like how it was on track for in 2014.

On top of this I don't know any sector of tech that takes over 2 years to solve a problem and still plans to take an additional 2 years, those projects die out as it is unacceptable.  This statement doesn't mean I believe the current BTC devs are not good at programming but it just leads me to believe that they have intentions of stalling for a reason they are not sharing with the community.

TLDR; BTC Hodl'er that wants to spend BTC, can't spend it, whine whine cry cry, don't believe we should sit and hold and tell other people around the world you can't have it unless you can afford it.  Everyone should be able to afford BTC thats the point of it.

This whole thing is ridiculous and you can tell that he is getting really emotional because his narrative is slipping away from him.

Big-blocks don't change that. Watch this interview again and you'll see Roger tell you how the miners will determine the cost of space on the blockchain.

Big deal. Its not additional. Bitcoin-Legacy will print the same coins. We will reach halvening sooner and skyrocket before them.

"That was true before Core & Blockstream developers released Segwit version. Bitcoin Core (or Segwit) is the version of Bitcoin maintained by Core, there are multiple other Bitcoin developer teams operating now. 

Get used to diversity in bitcoin development ...  "
It segwit 2X fork happened, that would have been Bitcoin, right?
Broken clock. The schedule is 12.5 per block. That happened. BCH is alive . The EDA worked. BCH is up 5x in 3 months. Fuck off butthurt troll.
You are here full time to spread misinformation, and have been for months. That makes you a pro. Easy to turn that into an accusation of 'groupthink', but what kind of sick person does what you do... unless he is working with an agenda

Ok. So what do we call the 2 bitcoin forks?

BTC = bitcoin ?

Because the subreddit split predates the fork. 
So did IBM, Pets.com, Dell, Debeers, AT&T, etc.
Yeah, r/the_donald should totally be censored. Oh shit, I forgot, they already are! Reddit admins implemented several algorithm changes just to make them appear smaller than they are. Reminds me of a lot of whats happening at r/bitcoin.
"Wrong.

Bitcoin Cash is the only fork of Bitcoin that still adheres to what Satoshi named Bitcoin. Nothing else deserves the appellation."
"A little light dispels an exponential amount of darkness.

We can tell you are anxious about our project, thats why you are so obsessed. I feed off your fear, post more, I'm ravenous.

"
and what about /r/bcash being a sub that is controlled by Bitcoin Core with only negative posts against Bitcoin Cash? Just check yourself is easy.
Sorry but the connotations and history associated with the word nigger carries with it massive weight. A few trolls calling BCH bcash in no way compares to hundreds of years of human subjugation and exploitation of an entire race.
"> But if Segwit is that great, why does Luke DashJr advise to not use it?

Because Segwit increases tx capacity, and Luke wants a blocksize reduction.  He's advising people not to use it because it allows for more txs to be processed.  In short, he's a lunatic.

> As I understand it, it's a 60000 line of code 

The vast majority of that code was tests.

So you prefer the opinion of someone who knows nothing about how it works?  That's kind of crazy.."
"What? You ok there buddy?   

Maybe read up on [what's a fork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_\(software_development\)) before making up some weird family related analogies. Spoiler, it's very much a literal fork (as in fork in a road) - there was one, now there are two."
"What? Intimidation? Use whatever verb you want to describe how Roger reacted. The point is stop with the naming arguments, if you don't like Bcash then you can't support Bcore or Bsegwit or whatever it's being called these days. Call it what every single exchange calls the two. Done.

The mud slinging is out of control on both subs. For instance that recent radio ad for Bitcoin cash that described Bitcoin as being run by *big bank Nazis* just underlines my point - if Roger believes that then I don't expect interviewers to not stoop to a similar level of trolling. If you're dishing it then you better be able to take it.

How about focusing the discussion on technical merits?"
"> What does Core have? Greg Maxwell's opinion?

Price and market share?"
Core has always maintained bitcoin.... pretty sure it wasn’t called bitcoin core before you came around and started following Judas and how do you get to decide what is and what isn’t bitcoin? Who cares if it has segwit or whatever else?
"I realize it goes both ways, exactly why I don't get flustered about either name and believe rather than arguing a moot point, just call it as 99% of all exchanges do for simplicity. The fact that Roger got so enraged about bcash but used Bcore makes no sense to me.   

As someone invested in both coins I'm just sick of the infighting regarding the damn name. It makes Bitcoiners in general look like a bunch of children.

Just another Bitcoin fork. There's one every other week and they all claim to be the real bitcoin. Bitcoin Cash is no different."
Dont you get it? The different histories of the words are *not* what's being compared here. It's the principle behind the fact that the words themselves have become derogatory, determined by the history associated with that word, whatever that history may be - and the fact that those associated histories have been seen as an insult.
But Bcash is just another Bitcoin fork like Bitcoin Gold and Bitcoin Diamond. So let's just stick to what the exchanges call them...Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash 
I go to r/the_donald too. I do it for the crazy
Why isn't this sub redirecting to /r/bch or /r/bitcoincash?
Got nothing else but insults and accusations? Did anybody revert emission of 120 thousand coins outside of schedule?
Nope, it's exactly the other way around. 
"you're trying too hard. 

"
Yeah, who cares BCH forkers printed additional 120 thousand Bitcoins right? Its only bad when evil bankers do it.
Why did you have to specify that you were talking about Bitcoin Cash? Shouldn’t you have said bitcoin is bitcoin? Otherwise that statement is kind of like saying dogecoin is bitcoin. It’s nonesense. You guys are pretty dense on this sub. The more you fight BCash as a title the more this will backfire. 
"Ok, we will call BTC ""bcore shitcoin pump & dump"" and BCH ""The One True Bitcoin™"". So don't get triggered when we refuse to call bcore Bitcoin, you can't have it both ways."

Or, how about you call Bitcoin Cash 'Bitcoin', and all your buddies don't get ""triggered"" if we call it Bcore?   Shit goes both ways dude. 
 And we have an actual document (the White Paper) backing our implementation.   What does Core have?   Greg Maxwell's opinion?"
So when reddit says they accept bitcoin do they mean Bitcoin Cash? Now I’m confused. 
Except there is a seperate project called Bcash so people using that term for BCH are quite specifically wrong to do so.
"You're denying reality. There is only 1 bitcoin and its not BCH.

I could If I wanted, get on the darknet and spend some BITCOIN to by some sweet sweet Herb. 

I can't do any of that with your BCH. WHy?

Because its not real bitcoin bitch!

"I can comfirm that,

I get quite intense period of sleep deprivation due to my job sometimes, it does make very « edgy » at some point.."
bcore, i think this answers your question. Its the 'Bitcoin' name, and everything that Bitcoin Cash defends, but in my opinion, that's not a problem at all, but when you ask nicely to people to not call you by your last name instead of your first name, people that respect you will call you the first name, others will be disrespecting you.
"its the version of Bitcoin released by ""core"" ... how else to identify it?"
"Oh, maybe I was thinking about how that sentence was relevant to the context? ;)"
"> Well Bitcoin-Core is actually not clearly Bitcoin anymore as it has soft forked from the whitepaper, whilst BCH actually fits the original ideas presented. So Bitcoin actually refers more to BCH than Bitcoin-Legacy.

I just call it bcash to get a rise out of people as they are such touchy snowflakes about it. If the tech is actually better it'll win without having to co-opt the Bitcoin name. I'm fairly neutral in the whole scaling debate and hold both coins but winding people up over a new is too much fun to pass up, just like all the idiots who call it bcore or blockstreamcoin.
"Just go and google for yourself ... you can see that ""Core"" was a title added around the time that Blockstream got involved in 2014 and includes most of the staff paid by Blockstream. Bitcoin itself was developed for many, many years before ""Core"" ever existed. "

"> hence use Segwit and aren't a chain of digital signatures anymore

Sigh..  This is extremely discouraging to see.  You are repeating the lies of a loudmouth politician, who doesn't understand the technology at all.

There are tens of thousands of segwit txs a day.  Multi-million dollar services like ShapeShift are *exclusively* using segwit.  Billions of dollars of volume have moved through segwit txs.  If there was no chain of digital signatures, this money would be stolen.  ShapeShift would be bankrupt.

This lie has gone on for far too long.  You guys should be embarrassed.  Too many ignorant people listen to Roger (a non-technical politician) about technical related matters.  It's dangerous.  He's brainwashing you.  It's really upsetting that you guys believe whatever nonsense comes out of his mouth.

Do yourself a favor.  Read the latest edition of Andreas' Mastering Bitcoin.  He goes over segwit.  Read about it from an engineer, not from a mouthpice.  Roger has never written a line of code in his life.  He doesn't understand Bitcoin from a technical point of view.  He is not qualified to tell you what is happening under the hood.

The equivalent would be an old lady who only drives engines with carburetors.  When fuel-injected engines come out, she says that they aren't ""real"" engines because they don't burn gas to produce torque.  The engineers all agree that she's wrong, and the new fuel-injected engines do in fact burn gas and produce torque.  They show her by starting a car with a fuel injected engine and driving around.  But she's adamant.  She continues to just cry ""no"" and points to absolutely nothing as evidence.  She convinces a small part of the car enthusiast community that fuel injected engines do not produce torque, despite the fact that people are driving them around all day every day.

Don't listen to this old lady.  Don't listen to Roger Ver.  Neither know what they are talking about.  Fuel injected engines do in fact produce torque, and segwit does in fact maintain a digital signature chain that has been present since day one.

You guys sound insane when you repeat this comically stupid lie.  You should be embarrassed."
Ok but I don’t think that means anything really. It’s just a name. Most of “core” today is not even blockstream.

It's confusing as hell to havea small group of people trying to force this terminology change on everyone. If bcash i better than bitcoin, it'll win no matter what it's name is right?"
Was issuing 200 million dollars worth of coins outside schedule part of the whitepaper? Do quote me that part!
Minus the whole EDA, then DAA. Those forks don't count right?
Does that invalidate that he calls it his project rather than a project he puts effort into?
"Under what condition does it change? It seems very hard to collect votes in any way other than mining. Nodes are virtually free, and their votes can't be reliably trusted.

Deliberately resistant to change is good if that change is bad. But one could argue that non-change can also be bad. In evolutionary terms, something that is resistant to change, is also less adaptable. Currently, there is much competition. A lack of adaptation can be arguably worse than a lack of change.

The block size cap was arbitrarily set to some hard-coded limit. I think that was an oversight which was never thought to be a limiting factor for real-world use. If it had been set such that a block size increase would be valid if the last 2016 blocks had average fees per block greater than X (again, some arbitrary number).. This could have also protected against spam, but allowed for future growth."
/r/bitcoin = mixes technology with religion. Some call these people Bitcoin Minimalists  but I think there is a overlaying  group that should be called bitcointologists. All though nobody know how many people in this group are shills and trolls and how many are actual brainwashed people.

"Hm, where did the ""and my axe"" bot go? Haven't seen it lately..."
Yes, use BCH if you want to abbreviate. Use 'bcash' if you want to troll

>  Obviously I take issue with comparing a term for a cryptocurrency with a term that has a profoundly negative and racist connotation that is directed at actual oppressed human beings.

It's not obvious at all, to me, why you would take issue with that. As I mentioned above, it's not the particular words or their meanings that are being compared, but the *idea* that words can (and do!) affect people at all, based on their history. Don't act like you don't understand this. ;)

> I hold a number of cryptocoins, and I literally cannot fathom caring if someone started calling any one of them, ""trashcoin"" or something equivalent

Ok, but arguments from personal incredulity aren't usually very convincing. Just saying. ;)

Let's do a thought experiment:

Situation 1: Someone calls Bitcoin ""Buttcoin"" and makes punny jokes about it. We both literally couldn't care less, right?

Situation 2: Someone were interviewing us regarding our position on Bitcoin's future, but they insisted on calling it Buttcoin throughout the interview, despite us asking for it to be called Bitcoin in the context of that interview. And this request would make sense, seeing as ""Buttcoin"" is just a derogatory nickname for Bitcoin. After all, we'd want viewers to clearly understand what we were talking about. After the interview, we'd both think the interviewer was a troll, an asshole, or at the very least was being impolite, right?

TLDR: It's all about the context. Which would be straight-up 101 knowledge for any linguist."

Rog, I'm totally fine with you ripping people a new a$$hole when they use the term BCash..

When someone parrots ""BCash this, BCash that ... "", you come back with ""when you say BCash, do you mean :

 * the Bitcoin implementation that is most faithful to the original Satoshi Whitepaper ?
 * the Bitcoin normal people can use because your transactions confirm in the next block and fees are low ?
 * the Bitcoin that isn't sponsored by Blockstream to sell their patent-encumbered LN side-chain addon ?
 * the Bitcoin code base that isn't polluted with overly complex features like SegWit and Replace-By-Fee ?  .. or
 * the Bitcoin that doesn't keep 80% of transactions waiting around in a queue into an artificial tiny 1MB bottleneck ... or
 * the Bitcoin entrepreneurs can build a new kind of internet business around, because its fees are small enough to support micro-transactions ???

Roger.  If you want to be viewed as a professional and an opinion that matters in the space.  Events like today cannot occur.  Unfortunately for you today you let that happen to yourself.  Your professional stock went down and you tarnished your brand.  Be better.  For the Bitcoin community as a whole, be better.
✊🏿
Thanks for the great work for keeping bitcoin cheap and usable for everyone. I guess your intention for debating with these trolls is to reach out brainwashed new comers with the original view of bitcoin. Even though your intentions are good and working, i don't think you should waste time with these trolls. Bitcoin cash will replace bitcoin not because a lot of people will be convinced that it is better, but they will experience and see that it is better. You should focus on your great work about integration of bitcoin cash with the real world usecases. I am looking forward the day that bitcoin cash's tx count really exceeds bitcoin. After that you won't need to debate at all.
A generation who grew up around toxic online communities. They are a different breed. They need someone who can speak their language, rather than well mannered and civil representatives.
"Hi Roger, just wanted to say that i like you and understand your reaction.
But you must be more careful in the future about anything public you do, because you are getting more popular/famous all the time.

ALSO, anyone who thinks bcash is a good name, cannot be taken seriously in business/marketing. maybe Bitcash wouldnt be that bad?"
"> They're almost as bad as scientologists

Right fucking on."
"Apparently this reddit is censoring comments now. I said BCash and got edited.

Nice!"
"> Meanwhile antonopoulos is pussying out of every offered debate, because he can't possibly explain the 180 of his views during the years

to be fair Antonopoulos basically says the market will decide and is generally coin agnostic.  He does think 2nd layer scaling solutions are a good idea. I dot see any argument why they arent"
I 100% agree with this full comment!

"> I find it ironic since at the beginning when they get in, they laughed and joked how fiat will die and how its useless etc etc, then as their account grows they now worry about how to diversify into wallstreet, property and precious metals.

That's HOW it dies. 

What other motivation will there be other that fiat having no value next to Bitcoin?

Fiat is the sinking ship. Everyone wants into Bitcoin before their money is dust.

This is the S-Curve. At the top $USD1 = 0 and 1BTC = 1BTC. That's why the market cap goes up to *""All the money in the world""*.

That is what adoption means. 21 million Bitcoin worth all of the money."
"getting and trading cash costs nothing because there is no effort beyond the initial printing.  using visa/mc/amex requires 3% fee because of the amount of processing and storage.

i don't understand why people expect any crypto to be free or nearly free when it requires as much or more compute as credit cards we know today.  i do agree 4 to send 100 is expensive, but 4 to send 10,000 is cheap.  the only method to resolve that issue is side chains, unless you want to keep it a store of value.  even bch cannot scale to compete with cash, because it will never be free to send crypto."
Not trying to pick sides, but he kept calling Bitcoin “Core” instead of just bitcoin. It should be “Bitcoin” and “Bitcoin Cash”. I think both were just using abbreviations. Core and BCash just slide of the tongue easier...

"No no, Fake Satoshi calls BCash 'Bitcoin Cash' as well. A liar and a fraud, and a criminal (two actually), as the figureheads of BCash.

I mean, what great leadership. "
">  If we all believe that Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin, why does it matter if some idiots refuse to call it Bitcoin? It's actually a very juvenile tactic to just call something by an incorrect name as a weak attempt to delegitimize it, so let them continue to look like children.

So it's all good for this sub to keep calling bitcoin corecoin, segwit coin, or all of those other names, legacy coin, etc.

You are refusing to call it bitcoin, which it has been called since inception.  And then you say we believe that bitcoincash is bitcoin.

You are literally doing exactly what you are speaking out against.

The mental gymnastics around here is astonishing.  bcash bcash bcash, now watch Roger have a stroke lol

this sub is amazing"

" I am not Roger Ver, I am not Jihan Wu, I am not a sockpuppet, and I care more about how and if something works then what it is called. They can call it ButtonPoop, but then people wondering why the fees are so high and the transactions take so long would hear: Oh you got to use ButtonPoop, that works better then Bitcoin Core.


"
If I call Bitcoin Cash, Bcash will I be banned or downvoted to hell? because Bcash is easier to say. I hold Bcash and have no problem calling it Bcash. Wtf is the problem here? Is this a cult? (Experiment to test tolerance and acceptance to other viewpoints.)
"Looks like John mostly used the term ""Bitcoin Cash"" in the interview and only a few times called it bcash https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB0mG7wMvM8

Roger is pretty unstable for going off the rails based upon this. "
"This^ 

Tip 0.01 BCH /u/tippr"
"Not sure man, to me Roger comes across as someone who wants to steal the name bitcoin. That in itself seems shady. Whats wrong with BCash anyway? I like it. And yea, interviewer in original argument was a bit pessimistic but he brought up some legitimate concerns I think.

I would love it if BCH does great. But it can't do well if people are thinking its trying to steal the brand, and by having 'bitcoin' right in the name that makes if seem like its trying to do that.

People are obviously going to be opposed to that. I think Roger Ver is doing BVH a disservice actually. "
"Link to the emotional argument:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qrp7rjNtlFM&feature=youtu.be"
"I wouldn't care, and dont believe roger would care either, what it was called, if not for the initial effort of small blockers in registering all the subbreddits, web addresses, etc related to the term ""bcash"". Why would we be ok with people hostile to the system controlling all the internet properties associated with the name? We're already on guard about that kind of thing because of Theymos having control of most of the ""bitcoin"" web properties."
"This guy gets it. Getting angry over what other people call you shows only 1 thing: That you are immensely insecure. If Roger Ver would have been in my high school class, he would be the guy I would have picked on. Such an easy target. All I would need to do to get him angry is to call him Boger 10 times.

However, I have to say that it takes reasonable amount of personality to apologize like this."
"well I don't think Blockstream supporters would call it bcash if they weren't afraid of it.

Funny thing is it sounds similar to wei dai's b-money which is referenced in Satoshi's paper. So.. I don't know the universe is ironic in lyricism. Someday maybe Core supporters will all get burnt lol. Anyways I like Bitcoin Cash, when Bitcoin-Blockstream dies off, we'll just revert to calling Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin anyway. "
treefingerz is spot on.
"This, this, million times this! They LOVE it when we get angry about BHC being called ""bcash"". Just let them call it whatever they want."

Hooray for BCash! Thanks Roger.
"Lmao.. this fucking guy.....

I want to see the original video that made him lose it haha.

I like the part where he says he caught somebody red handed he just doesn't know who.  lmfao  Ok.  "
You are getting angry because of name calling?
He had nothing to apologize for, he may have lost his cool but the interviewer was being a complete dick. 
Don't drink the cool aid. 
"I'm someone that generally alligns with the core side of the debate, but I completely agree that the way he treated you was absurd. I've gone out of my way to call bitcoin cash bitcoin cash and I'm generally of the opinion that MOST people on both sides aren't ""shills"" or ""paid trolls"", that they are just passionate about their position. I'm of the opinion that the majority of people in this debate are not bad actors, you included. I really wish that people on both sides of the argument could treat eachother with more respect.

There are many, many people on both sides calling people on the other side of the argument trolls or paid shills when it quite clearly isn't true. Both sides of the argument have very clear and intentionally derogatory language that t hey use to describe people and ideas from the other side.

On the core side there are all of the people that call bitcoin cash bcash/btrash, along with everyone calling jihan wu all of the ridiculous names they call him. Same with the way they treat roger. That said this disrespect certainly isn't something that is exclusive to the bitcoin core side of the discussion. There are people that intentionally conflate blockstream with bitcoin core even though they are quite clearly separate entities. there are plenty of unfounded and ridiculous conspiracies thrown around about people on the core side of the discussion and their intentions that are very clearly just not the case. 

It is possible to disagree with people on the internet and do it in a respectful and productive way. All of this hate and vitriol not only doesn't help it actively makes things worse.

I hope that in the future that people from both sides can come to treat each other with respect, but I don't expect to see that happen."
"Roger shouldn't be so emotional. The other dude was an obvious a hole 
"
It was amazing how the interviewer pretended not to understand what you meant about there being effectively no block size limit until blocks are full. He was just going to say anything to side against bitcoin cash. like that bitcoin segwit is highly valued, but I can still admit lower fees and faster confirmations is better and should be more valuable.
Sooo I'm /r/outoftheloop. What is going on?
Since you're an AnCap I would assume that you wouldn't sue for slander and trying to ruin your reputation as your reputation isn't held by you, per se, but is the speech of others and how others view you and would thus be an unjust action according to strict property rights. An therein, it would be an unjust use of force to sue for that reason. Immoral I would most definitely side with you, but use legal force against him? No. Ignore him, disassociate with him, exclude him from your property, go right ahead.
Lol I actually love this – Jesus flipped tables, and Bitcoin Jesus flipped the bird. It’s better to keep your cool, but sometimes you gotta show a little emotion.
Roger, honestly I don't think you should let the Bcash nonsense get to you, if they wanna call it that then let them, them calling it that doesn't actually do anything unless you let it annoy you. Frankly, if Bitcoin Cash supporters called it that as well it'd take away their power entirely.
Why the fk is bcash so insulting? It's a name good god you sook.
what's wrong with bcash name?
"The only thing I didn’t like about this interview was that Roger apologized to this fucking troll. “Why are you offended by me calling you a chink? It’s just a convenient name! Less syllables than ‘Chinese-American.’ Get over it.”

He said at the end. He had a bet with people that he’d purposely get Roger to “rage quit.” Fuck this dude, Roger. Absolutely no reason to apologize. But it’s man of you to extend an arm of grace even so."
This guy gives me the creeps. Just watching his mannerisms you can tell he's sleezy. I'm all for other Crypto's because fuck the banks, but man this guys vibes throws me off.
"/u/MemoryDealers 

Roger, I don't know if you'll read this, but I just wanted to say that I don't always agree with your opinions, but losing your cool in that situation showed me that you're just as much a human being than any of us and I'm glad to have such an outspoken and supportive person on our team!"
"What they do when they attack you is called ""projection"" it's a psychological defense mechanism.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_projection

To rationalize all the bad manipulative shit they do, they keep pretending that they have no choice to do it because the other camp is also doing it, even if their accusation are completely baseless.

Each time they falsely accuse you or our community of doing some manipulative shit, be sure that it's because they are doing it right now.

ROGER! DO NOT FEED THE TROLLS!!
"bitcoin branding has become a hyper-sensitive area of late,,
 if we wish to freely and legitimately refer to bitcoin-btc as legacy and bcore, then our detractors will surely claim the same freedom to use the nickname bcash for bitcoin-bch

it's a bit like 2 kids squabbling over the tarnished bitcoin toy that they both so dearly know & love, but they fail to see  their newly minted gleaming toys tucked away in the corner waiting to be noticed...one with a label 1.14 btc and the other with 8xbch 


"
"M’kay so then honoring your own stated request I’m gonna ask all y’all *really nicely* to stop calling Bitcoin by the term “Bitcoin Core.”

Bitcoin is Bitcoin
Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin Cash

BTC is BTC 
BCH is BCH

Agreed? Thanks. "
serioulsy it was the funniest parody ever. The best actors couldn't have enact that. I just love everything, how it's all about the name during 40-50 minutes, it ends with a finger and the other one saying bcash repeatedly. And then the video transition the Roger's apologies.One day it will be a cult video 
Roger, you don't owe anything to anybody.  The harassment against bitcoin cash supporters has gotten way out of hand.  I can't imagine what it's like in your position as one of BCH's leading figureheads.  It IS worth getting upset about and fighting back against.  You should be proud of yourself for sticking up for what you believe in, as well as sticking up for the rest of us here.  As far as I'm concerned, we owe you a good amount of gratitude.

Guy was a passive aggressive prick.  Next time just refer to Bitcoin as Bitcoin Segwit, Bitcoin Legacy, or bcore.
"This video really heated up my personal crypto chat among 20 friends.

It really puts into light the mentality shift that happened amongst the group.  Those that got in early this year and late last year with the excited idea of a crypto with utility, now have back tracked on their words and cling to 'store of value'.  I am guessing it is their psyche that wants to protect their new found wealth when they see their accounts skyrocket to $250k in fiat currency.

I find it ironic since at the beginning when they get in, they laughed and joked how fiat will die and how its useless etc etc, then as their account grows they now worry about how to diversify into wallstreet, property and precious metals.

Any reasonable discussion goes out the window because they say transactions fees don't matter, $4-$6 is acceptable to send $100k.  What they are forgetting and refuse to even acknowledge when you point out to them that sure $4 for $100k is fine, but what about $4 on $100?

They then instantly deflect and will never answer the question, they refuse to admit that BTC in any way shape or form can have any wrong doing.  Where as earlier in the year, they would complain that a BTC transaction is lost in the mempool for 24-48 hours.  They went from posting about the ideas behind other cryptocurrencies, the reasons for them to exsist, to now trying to find videos that make you look bad. (Roger Ver)



I guess the point of my rant is human emotions are taking over vs the ideology behind BTC, and why it was created in the first place.   It is really jaw dropping to see the mentality shift change right in front of your eyes between your friends who were all for change at the start, but once their own networth becomes to much, their ideologies no longer matter and it's all about preserving networth.

Thank you for your efforts Roger, although you did come off bad in the interview, its understandable to anyone with a reasonable unbiased view as to why.  He came into the interview unprepared and with the goal of attempting to get you worked up.  There is a video of you being interviewed by the blockchainers, who are against BCH as well but they come off way more reasonable and at least allow you to speak and attempt to try to get your points across."
"Obviously you realize you played right into his hand. He did a good job baiting you.  :\ 

Perfectly human response though. I've always thought it must be extraordinarily frustrating answering the same questions and refuting the same points over and over, especially when people are being douches about it. 

"
Roger has been the subject of a constant stream of vicious de-humanizing insults from rbitcoin for the greater part of a year.  It'd get under anybody's skin.  Thanks for taking all the slings and arrows for us /u/memorydealers!  Live and learn from this one, that's all.
/u/MemoryDealers are you coming to Europe soon? What we could do is a proper interview in a proper studio.  
"Core boots and trolls are numerous. These people disgust me.

Core and Blockstream are the worst thing that could happen to Bitcoin... and it happened. It kind of proves that saying:

**anything that can happen, eventually will**

Now we have to fight them again and I hope we don't ever do the same mistake again and allow someone to dictate and try to prevent Bitcoin Cash from scaling on-chain. Off-chain solutions is fine, but never at the expense of on-chain scaling as this is where true P2P decentralisation is happening, not on the side chains but on Bitcoin layer only."
Roger, you are a class act. Don't change. 
"Roger the very fact that they go through such an efford to try to discredit Bitcoin Cash tells everybody they are afraid of it and see it as a genuine threat. That's why they are okay with talking about Bitcoin Gold and Bitcoin Diamond because they don't really take those serious.

Please learn from this. If your opponents want to try to push your buttons by calling it bcash, let them. Who cares, it's just a name. It could be called ButtonPoop and still work better then Bitcoin Core.  You can be above this kind of stuff. You should be above this kind of stuff. "
Do you have a link to the original interview?
*Sinking ship*
Suspect character suspicions confirmed. Guy is a tool.. 
That moment when you realize you just exposed yourself, and you try to collect yourself and do damage control immediately.  Damn it must feel horrible to realize no amount of bitcoin in the world could undo the damage you did to your own cause today.
Then stop calling bitcoin, “bitcoin core.” Works both ways, roger. Stop playing the victim.
"You need to pick your battles /u/memorydealers. Debating someone as ""trolly"" as him doesn't serve any good purpose imo.

He and his followers are obviously core supporters and are hard to convert regardless of which side is right. 

Focus on new blood and new markets, there are no shortages of those "
Can someone explain why people hate the term 'bcash' so much? seems like a weird hill to die on
"Roger ""I""M A MILLIONAIRE"" Ver

pahahaha, your're so pathetic. You have caused the most hate this community has ever seen. BRAVO. i was keen on holding BCASH but now i'll sell on your next pump. I wont hold a coin that has anything to do with that much arrogance "
">one of their products

As open as I am to the merits or not of Bitcoin Cash/BCash/BCH (I care not what it is called), this slip here is the biggest issue I have with everything this sub, bitcoin.com and ""BCH"" is.  It's a Roger Ver *product*.  

It's spearheaded, controlled, led, shaped, by one man.  I would say manipulated but wouldn't want to be sued for libel.

The best thing that could happen to BCH's reputation would be less Roger, more community, more visibility of other 'authorities'.

Just my relatively noobie opinion."
"Even I have left the livestream in the middle. (When it was live.)
Really unacceptable his behaviour.
Just don't feed the trolls next time.
Stay cool.
Maybe you learned something from it, that people want you to lose your shit.
Get a lawyer.
I hope these types of discussions will end soon. 
It's toxic for everyone involved.

As far as the shill thing is concerned. Its probably worth pointing out that we are arguing over what currency should be worth more money. Not one of us isn't technically a shill. Like if I decide to start making 3 or 4 pro BCH memes a day and putting them up on various locations. I would be a shill promoting BCH. 
If bcore fans want to call Bitcoin Cash bcash, why should we care? I don't blame Roger for pushing back on the sock puppet accusations, though.
Wrestling with pigs in the dirt. Regardless of the outcome, you get dirty and they will have all the pleasure.
"Takes guts, to directly apologize for going out of line. Know a lot of people that won't show face after that. 

I'm assume you're telling the truth and the whole bitcoin/crypto idea was always to be ones one bank without being scared something or someone is messing it up. (like getting coins stuck in a platform because people aren't willing to scale up for some dubious reason)

Edit: I forgot: Thanks Roger, I hope you're right (and so far I can see you are)."
Bah, apologize not apologize. Accepted,  anyway mr self made millionaire 
It was a great interview except for the part where he misleads the audience on Bitcoin Core transaction fees. I've been transferring multiple times today for less than $2 aud. Yep, still higher than intended but nothing close to the USD fees he was stating. Other than that misleading part the interview went well and I loved his economic viewpoints. 
I'm sorry man this guy was always going to act the way he is acting. It's easy to get triggered but this guy is so childing I wouldn't have let him get to me I would have cut him off earlier. No point debating his when all he can do is name call.
You don't need to apologize. It's obvious the guy was only trying to piss you off and not trying to have any meaningful discussion.
You don't need to apologize. $1 /u/tippr
He couldn't keep his cool, he should be prepared to deal with trolls
He shouldn't apologize this guy who was speaking with Roger was a complete prick
"Your passion and idealism has played no small part in Bitcoin's success. Thank you, seriously. 

The downside is some aholes take advantage.

Apology accepted--Onwards Brother!"
I like that our resident troll is getting upvotes. Post more stuff like this please. I get you're on the other side, but there's no reason for you to troll like you usually do when you can give logical statements like these. +1
"Good, keeping it cool is the most important thing when handling haters. Concentrate on informing the masses, not on convincing rhe trolls. They will become very quiet when the time comes.

I recently snapped as well during a heated discussion... after watching your video I also feel like apologizing to the troll I shouted at. Thanks for having the balls to apologize, Roger. Even a troll deserves being treated with respect, otherwise I am not much better after all."
"I've heard Roger refer to btc by a few different names now. As long as thats done, trolls will feel more than justified calling bch bcash.
I don't understand this mindset, if you want someone to stop insulting you the worst thing you can do is insult them back. "
"Have a question, Why is everyone congratulating him?

he literally got ticked off for someone saying bcash. I dont care what your name is but if you get ticked off if I pronounce something differently, fuck u. "
Such a tool. Did a great job manipulating the market for his bitcoin cash ideology though. It's too bad he probably lost most of his actual bitcoin in the process though. Happy 10k y'all 
You should start hiring a PR assistant or start training in personality development. That's what all celebrities, big CEOs and all other top/high profile people do. Your life is not just yours. You're representing a much bigger world now.

You are not alone.

Keep up the good job."
"If they want to call Bitcoin Bcash let them, we can call the legacy chain SegWit coin and be done with it.

Ultimately it is what the public will call it and they will refer to what they are using as bitcoin.  We can be sure for the foreseeable future no more than 300k transactions per day will happen on SegWit coin."
"r/Bitcoin mods are removing all comments that do not spew hate on Roger Ver, They are using their subreddit to unjustly character assassinate. A real propoganda machine that shares much in common with despot dictatorships.

"I've watched the original video, and I just gotta say that you don't deserve to be treated the way he treated you. He went into that interview with the purpose of making you rage quit. 

You have absolutely nothing to apologize for. Quite the contrary, you could sue him for slander/libel. I'm looking at the /r/bitcoin posts, and they're 100% about you, 100% grounds for suing him. Please don't quit BITCOIN CASH. "
"Man, this is not EVE Online.

Even if it was, you would be really bad at it.

Who gets decide what people call something in a decentralised environment? is it a requirement to have millions to be involved and have a say? I have some bcash and theres no bad intent behind that, its the logical abbreviation.
one is a self made billionaire living in Tokyo and the other one seems to live with his mum, her poodle and her ugly lining. Also, she still chooses his clothes for him :P

Did he really just call BCH his product?
we are with you Ver   GO BCASH !!!!
"And I hoped this was an apology for wearing those stupid ""air pods"" during the interview..."
"One thing about Roger Ver, this guy is a real guy with passion for Liberty and Bitcoin.  It takes guts to put yourself out there in the arena.  I am reminded of that old Theodore Roosevelt quote:

> ""It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat. ""

The truth is that extremism in defense of Liberty is no vice.  Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, and Satoshi's vision and OUR vision is about bringing freedom to the world.  Its about a high velocity digital cash, permissionless system, that is censorship resistant. It about a system that allows us to stop being sucked dry by government, central banking parasites. Its about a new system that allows us to raise ourselves out of debt slavery and defeat oligarchy.  Its a revolution.  It is a dream to bring Freedom and a Meritocracy to the planet, where wealth is earned, and not scammed out of thin air.  

Bitcoin has always been about bringing Liberty and capitalism to the world, and trade to the world, even in places where it has been impossible in the past.  Bitcoin has the power to liberate and lift people from poverty, and allow them to participate in the global economy for the first time. While BlockStream Chief Strategy Officer Samson Mow [says Bitcoin is not for people who live on $2 per day](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/76372r/reminder_blockstream_chief_strategy_officer/).  Some of us realize humanity has unlimited potential that is only being held back by too-big-to-fail bailout, fiat printing, money monopoly systems.  Some us understand that Bitcoin can literally help unleash our unlimited potential and help humanity literally reach the stars.  There are untold innovations, technology and progress that has been held back by the legacy central banking government tyranny system. Yet Core is literally Blocking the Stream of innovation and holding us all back the exact same way.  Its no wonder they [are funded by AXA and Bilderberg](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7d02ee/some_thoughts_about_the_possible_bitcoin_segwit/), the same people who run the oligarchy.  The manipulators use their demagoguery to take advantage of the same old socialist types that lack understanding of economics. The same anti-capitalists who are demonizing good people like Roger, and successful businessman and capitalists in this space.  If you are not upset about the dirty tricks, the lies, the censorship, the propaganda, the slander, the false agreements, and the backstabbing, then that says a lot about your character.  I wish more people were as passionate as Roger Ver and had the Don't Tread on Me, Honey Badger mentality.  Keep up the good work Roger, you are one of the greatest assets for Liberty and Bitcoin that we have.  We need more like you to stand up and fight, even if its not always perfect or pretty, we are in the arena.  Money is central to our society.  We are affecting this planet in ways that will decide the entire future of humanity for the rest of eternity.  /u/tippr gild"

What a great mind you have. Did you come up with that snappy reply all by yourself. If so A+.
I know, thats pretty obvious from the video, but he still thinks his words were justified, so its a half assed apology.
Satoshi's vision and my vision, and Liberty and Economic Freedom is much more important to me than owning a few dollars.  I have already made untold amounts of wealth due to people like Roger Ver and Gavin Andresen who evangelized and gave away thousands of Bitcoin to make it what it is today.  I hope you will realize that BCH is a true usable currency.  Look into the things we say here, peek behind the curtain.  You seem bitter, but I invite you to read my post history, [you can start here](https://www.reddit.com/user/cryptorebel/gilded/) and maybe you can be enlightened and switch teams. /u/tippr 1000 bits
Honestly its all the same. Bcoin, BTC, Bitcoin. United States, US, USA. Bitcoin Cash, BCH, BCash. I don't think BTC supporters would get sand in their vagina for that, like you did for calling BCH BCash.
"Not at all. Bitcoin Cash is two words, for starters. And it is a mouthful. It's a good ""idea"" name but not a good ""conversation"" name, if that makes any sense.

""Bitcoin"" is nice, succinct, and rolls off the tongue far better. It's the gold standard.

""BCash"" has unfortunately become loaded with ideological nonsense. It sacrifices the connection to Bitcoin, so it's not a name that conveys the essence of BCH. But it is a good conversation word. It sounds natural."
For Blockstream,I like BStream... Or PeeStream.  
But the bitcoin most people signed up for is the one that keeps rising forever. They don't care about the fundamentals.
:)
"I am a huge Bitcoin supporter, been so since rate was in single digits.  Bitcoin **will** change the world

Bitcoin Core aka Bitcoin Segwit is not even close to Bitcoin anymore.  

Bitcoin Cash absolutely is **exactly** as the Bitcoin I knew and loved for many years till it was corrupted from the inside years ago.

the **definition** of Bitcoin, aka the title of it's creation, is a peer-to-peer electronic **cash**, everything else is secondary and supportive, ie it's store of value which only exists because it was used as **cash** for many years"
"Well, it's double standard when you guys call Bitcoin, Bitcoin Segwit and Bitcoin Core, while minding ppl calling Bitcoin Cash bcash. Why do I have to say it twice? Weird.

> He is literally calling it bcash to undermine the bitcoin name attached to it.

Watch the cut here https://twitter.com/CryptosQueen/status/935569592424062977. The guy said Bitcoin Cash for a dozen of times and the only 2 times he used ""bcash"" (which he admitted to Ver he didn't do it intentionally) and he got insulted for making less than a 1M/year, doing porn etc. Anyone, despite their belief in what is real Bitcoin is, watching that entire interview and not thinking Ver is a bullying jerk should be ashamed of themselves."
^   This.  You can't rely on social media platforms to solve decentralization issues.  You've really got to take it straight to the blockchain.  Steemit has a good idea, but I am still reluctant about that.
"Wait are you people actually comparing the use of the term bcash to the N word? 

I swear to god this subreddit is some kind of bizarro world. I can't look away though."
"Leaving aside your untrue assertions of bitcoin, no matter what you think of bitcoin, that will not make bcash bitcoin. Bcash doesnt suddenly become bitcoin just because you dont like what bitcoin is. Just as bgold or bdiamond will never be bitcoin.

Can I hear you say bitcoin cash is,not bitcoin?"
"Waving his hands while chanting 'bcash' sure is mature https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJT2CbfHTpo&feature=youtu.be&t=44m28s

Also, the official name IS bitcoin cash, and the fact that he can't acknowledge that is in fact immature."
That escalated quickly. Please take care of yourself :)

There is no such thing, you saying that gives legitimacy to people calling Bitcoin Cash bcoin.  

Don't like it?  Stop being a hypocrite then."
"Same; not a big-blocker at all but that interviewer was such a troll. Even though I don't agree with a lot of Roger's positions, I feel his heart is in the right place and so I feel bad when stuff like this happens. I think he could have a bigger impact if he focused entirely on developing businesses around BCH and maybe doing a friendly press interview once in a while. Debating is, to be frank, not his strong point, and IMO he should avoid the Reddit drama altogether; Bitcoin is much bigger than a reddit holy war, too many influential people are wasting their time on here."
"right? Roger came off as such a jackass.  That was funny.   What was with the ""I'm richer than you"" attack lol.  Get a grip.  Roger was triggered.

He literally flips out for someone doing to him exactly what he's doing to BTC

"Yep exactly, and we all agreed with this at one point, but now they are probably spending the amount in their head in fiat.

IOTA
You cared about the facts and wanted a debate based on logic. It seems this was not their intent. Anyone wanting a debate based on logic would not be happy about that ending, but he was clearly happy with it.
"Just stop giving a shit about the name. ""Bcash""? Who cares? Nobody will die if it's called that, it's fine.

I love your work but on this issue you come across like a tranny getting upset about its pronouns. "
"lol thank you, that was funny.  I appreciate Rogers passion for his project, but damn.  

He's like Joel Osteen or something...  Voluntarist hahah"
They want to be dismissive of it, because they KNOW L2/3 wasn't even really talked about until ~3 years ago, so they want to rewrite history.   All pyramid/Ponzi's require an uneducated new base of users being mislead by older more knowledgeable recruiters.   They keep their troll army fresh by outright lying, so that the newbs who follow Core won't figure out their shell game.  The only shills I've seen are corporate(oil, pharma) and small blockers.

"I get where you are coming from, it does *seem* sensible to bump the block size while we sort the rest out but I still don't think we should for three main reasons (this applies to all bitcoin changes, not just blocksize):

* It sets a president.

If we take the admittedly easy way out for 'short-term success' it makes it likely that next time we come up against a problem we will take the easy way out again and so on.  Before too long Bitcoin will become a series of 'easy way outs'.

* It disincentives progress.

If we are constantly taking the easy way out it is quite possible (probable even) that we just won't fix the issues at all or even if we do no one will adopt them and take the easy path the we put in as a temporary fix.

* It doesn't get us where we want to go anyway.

We know it is not going to work, we know it is going to cause problems, why would we go down that path?  


The internet really comes to mind here, unfortunately, at the beginning, no one really thought hard about security, scaling, addressing, privacy etc.  and now we are paying the price for it.  Technologies to fix the issues (DNSSEC, opportunistic encryption, IPv6, routing) are all available but because of the decisions make early on adoption of the fixes is dismal and in some cases non-existent.

We are only at the beginning of Bitcoin and I really feel like now is the worst time to start making compromises of convenience."
"Actually, Roger is the victim here (he even freaked in a video if you want to watch it).


I am just pointing out that if he and his project (still don't believe he called Bitcoin Cash that) doesn't want to be victimized by mean people saying bcash he should stop being a hypocrite."
"You mistake me, I am not defending them.  I have always called bitcoin cash bitcoin cash because that is what I think you guys want it to be called.


I am just pointing out it is hypocritical of him to be so insulted by something that he himself thinks is perfectly fine behaviour when he does it."
"you're right, he has some emotional issues or something going on for reacting this way and not seeing he was being manipulated. 
The first question he should maybe ask himself is if he's doing this for the people as he claims or for himself. "

All of a sudden one person has sound money and is thriving in a system built around a trap.

Others observe this person, who now refuses to even accept worthless fiat. These others must convert over to receive these benefits too and then 1BTC = 1BTC and there is no issue anymore.

Its like the *flippening* so many here were told would happen to with BCH. However it's cash which is the victim."

"You're inserting a new word ""bank"" into it. Bcash does not insert any new letters or words into Bitcoin Cash. It's entirely appropriate. "
"> they try to hide the fact that Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Cash share the same blockchain up to the time of the split, and so Bitcoin Cash has as much the right to be called Bitcoin as Bitcoin Core.

This comical logic means that Bitcoin Gold and Bitcoin Diamond have just the same right to call themselves the ""real"" bitcoin as Bitcoin Cash.

The funny part is that I'd even argue that Bitcoin Gold is a *better* altcoin than Bitcoin Cash.  It's got an asic resistant mining algorithm.  That's at least something.

The reality is that all three of these forks are a joke and will never threaten Bitcoin."
"The interview actually shows how Blockstream controlled Bitcoin in a way.

You have Roger Ver. He is a multimillionare and one of the first investors in Bitcoin. He probably transacts millions worths of BTC/BCH everyday and has incentives to get low fees and have fast transactions.

On the other hand you have the interviewer. He might have alot invested but it is nothing in comparison to Ver. Somehow the interviewer gets him enraged to later on throw dirt on him and undermine ""BCash"" even more. So you could question his motives already beforehand. 

So If you look at both people but look at how Blockstream seized BTC, you can see it is a similar correlation between that and the interview. 

Bitcoin was seized by a small group of people that effectively censored and maintained the agenda to push the off-chain scaling. By manipulating and tactics they made their voices bigger than it is. Using social media is a effective way to sway opinion. You see it in action here. It has already gotten alot of retweets. 

So the stake the interview has on the line in Bitcoin is nothing compared to Vers and that is the same with Blockstream. So the point is if Blockstream would have a stake in it, they wouldnt have pushed for SegWit being a store of value. Which is what it is now because of the fees.

Blockstream were governed by making money from fees from their own off-chain solutions. They knew Bitcoin would never get commercial adoption because of their choices but still they pushed the agenda and slowed bitcoins evolution for years.
"
It was a debate, not an interview. And talking over your opponent is fair game. If Roger kept his cool and kept repeating his points then the guy would never really got any blows on him.
"Because it means a lot more than that. As others in this thread have stated, in this context it's short for ""I have stake in this."" Roger has dedicated his life to Bitcoin for years, yet has to deal with morons who start youtube channels for free, spout nonsense at him, and pretend like they're coming from the same place? They're simply not."
"Scientologists get people to do the same thing. Normal people have limits to how much verbal abuse they can take. Also it was the character assassination that was the final straw ""that he pays and operates sockpuppets"", when he doesnt.

Blockstream and r/bitcoin have been busted doing so, and of course they project this to others."
Well he's still calling it bitcoin, not cripple coin or segshit coin.
"I really don't think it's the same. 

Honestly I think ""Bitcoin Core"" is just specifying which bitcoin is being talked about, it's not derogatory as Bitcoin Core developers and surrounding community have used this term several times to describe BTC. Especially since Roger Ver thinks BTC is not the real bitcoin which is definitely an arguable subject so how could he called BTC aside from the 3-letter abbreviation without compromising his own belief?
"
good bot
Lets see some examples of your claims since you like shitting all over him specifically
There would be no need to distinguish if bcash developed its own branding and identity instead of stealing Bitcoin's.
"Bcash removed bitcoin completely from itself when it hard forked in August with a haphazard difficulty algorithm and clown car style big blocks.  It also chose to ignore features that increase efficient use of block resources.  

Bcash intentionally chose to become incompatible with the rest of the bitcoin network.  

Bitcoin is bitcoin, and will always be bitcoin.  


Disclaimer: I own bcash and bitcoin and want them both to succeed.

"However Ver calls it ""his project"" in the video."

"Mature and respectful? Roger flipped out and made a dick of himself, very embarrassing in my opinion.  And to be honest I really don’t see the issue of abbreviating a name it’s what people do it’s got nothing to do with disrespect. Is saying I live in the USA disrespectful?  People need to grow up about it it’s just a name and lets be honest when people say bcash we all know what they are talking about.
You need to accept the fact that the name bcash will be here forever and you will never stop people from saying it, so just suck it up and stop moaning about something so trivial. 
I hold equal amounts of both coins so I’m neutral in this ridiculous argument as I believe the crypto space is big enough for both coins to co exist.  "

Immature? Roger was the one who raged.
That error log guy (elog?) comes across as the most unbearable tosser I've seen in a while, and that is a fiercely competitive arena. You can see he's a lover of censorship - when he was worried that Roger was making good points he would try to start talking over him.

"How is the one using the ""I'm richer than you, what do you know?"" argument not the disgusting one in this situation?"
And how he smiled that the interview ended like that..  seems that was his true goal, not to have an actual logical debate.

Agreed.

> however bitcoin is clearly not ready for that when people can't avoid such simple pitfalls.

The official name bitcash is anyway taken by some kind of Japanese internet money that you can buy in convenient stores.
"The problem is that abbreviation comes from disinformation efforts by the opposition; they created fake sites and subs where they control the information, and linked to them in a sticky in their sub around the time of the fork; they've been trying to popularize the abbreviation to trick people into not finding real information about Bitcoin Cash."

I don't think its a blatant lie, because you can certainly argue that a false flag vote manipulation that was done in order to be as annoying and blatant as possible , as its been argued, is actually supporting bitcoin core. Certainly confusing for someone not familiar with the situation though.

They wouldn't waste their time spreading FUD and propaganda over something they legitimately believe is scam. They can't even utter the name of their boogeyman!
"The guy didn't even know what ""effectively"" means..."
"Saying Bitcoin Core is not the same as calling Bitcoin Cash Bcash.

Bcash removes Bitcoin completely from the name and thus robes Bitcoin Cash its ancestry.  
Bitcoin Core solely distinguishes the different Bitcoin forks but does not deny the brand recognition.

In addition B is often used when naming something that is of lesser quality. Like ""b movie"".

By the way I think Bitcoin SegWit is the better name because it reflects the technology this fork of Bitcoin has chosen."
I watched it as an observer with no skin in the game - I sincerely don't give 2 shits about either of these guys or their arguments and I don't own either coin.   With that said, the interviewer was a smug prick without any real arguments. 
"> Except Roger does the same thing, he spent the whole debate calling the Bitcoin currency/network ""Bitcoin Core""

What would you prefer we call it?"
Bitcoin does not exists anymore. There are Bitcoin Legacy/Core  and Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin as you know is simply dead. Get over it.
"The problem is that abbreviation comes from disinformation efforts by the opposition; they created fake sites and subs where they control the information, and linked to them in a sticky in their sub around the time of the fork; they've been trying to popularize the abbreviation to trick people into not finding real information about Bitcoin Cash."

You’re right. Bcash is another crypto that’s not out yet. Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin.
