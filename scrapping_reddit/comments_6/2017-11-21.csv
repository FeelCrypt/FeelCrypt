So /u/spez how much longer are you going to ignore the blatant censorship and manipulation r/bitcoin by its mods?
I just tried, lets see how long I last
"I got banned for calling the tether attack a ""fraud"" instead of a hack. "
Can confirm. I'm banned for mentioning Bitcoin Cash
im so glad I was banned from that meme filled sub
Lol, groan

That won't help much with hacked/sold accounts that have been around for a while.
It doesn't matter. I'll collect all what I can and then post it on r/btc. 
"It's suspicious to me that all this documented evidence starts around 11/14. Starting somewhere around 11/10 BCH experienced a gigantic run up and spike in volume, culminating in a price on 11/12 that was ~300% higher than it was just a few days prior. 

I don't know how, exactly, but this vote manipulation has to play into something bigger than just ""an attempt to make it seem like BCH supporters were evil"". 

Tinfoil hat theories - either this vote manipulation started even earlier, somewhere around 11/10, but OP wasn't able to find evidence for that. Or, this was an orchestrated distraction, perhaps a way to place blame on BCH supporters while some group made of with lots of cash after their pump and dump. "
Funny, I was also thinking about the Weinstein disclosures while reading the post.
Well, that is all the more incentive to keep pushing the Gmax-free version of Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, so we may bury BTC and that bullshit startup of his alive.
What did he do wrong? Everyone has multiple accounts. Look at the spam in your own sub reddit for multiple accounts of this. I would bet Maxwell doesn't give a shit if you know he has another reddit account. It's not against any rules.
"What if the US goverment could not find Satoshi so they compromised the people they did find, like maybe ... I don't know  ... theymos who you won't find anywhere but on the internet.  I mean it's an age old tactic right: Divide and conquer, divide and rule. 

What was the cliché Gandi quote?

Sure feels like a lot of fighting is going on.

How can we make sure the Reddit admins investigate this? 
It was up when I just checked
"This is obviously all paid for by someone. Not only did someone write a 10-page article, but then there happen to be links from dozens of subreddits?

A little too coordinated if you ask me"
good bot
"In this particular case, the use of hacked reddit accounts is what is criminal.  If they had just created a bunch of fake accounts with fake emails you would be right.  Hacking a person's account is a major federal crime under Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Fraud_and_Abuse_Act

Before the Community split into Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Cash people tried to get the block sized raised in other ways.  One of these was by making alternative nodes that included the block size increase and then encouraging miners to run and support it.  The first attempt at this was Bitcoin XT, then Bitcoin Classic, and finally Bitcoin Unlimited.  These clients all operated on the legacy chain and if enough people/miners used them would have triggered an upgraded block size.

Core launched a public smear campaign against the alternative implementations and people running the alternative software experienced hacking attacks in the form of DDOS (flooding a server with fake requests from hacked computers until it crashes) and DOS attack via undisclosed exploits (Someone reviewed the code and found bugs that would cause the node to crash then used that to attack nodes and make them crash constantly instead of reporting the issue so it could be fixed)

Both DDOS and Exploit DOS attacks are very illegal under US and other countries laws.  It's hard to pin responsibility for stuff like that on any one person though unless you are law enforcement and have subpoena power.  We were suspicious that it was probably Core/Blockstream but they always brushed it off as conspiracy.  This is direct evidence that they are willing to commit or be complicit in illegal activity."
"Pretty much everything should be archived on archive.is.  You'll have to replace ""np.reddit.com"" with ""www.reddit.com"""
"Hacking online accounts is illegal, misuse of computer system / computer system fraud.  Anyone who lives in the U.S. can sue the ISP who controlled those IP's and force them to identify who and where the money came from, and probably should so the hacker's identity can be confirmed.  The ISP will comply easily, they don't care.

/u/imaginary_username"
Probably on the run 
"So? We've been around this game for years. Reddit is pro rbitcoin. You're going to need a smoking gun so hot it makes ""60 minutes"" if you want to really change the dynamic. Only when reddit.com has to face significant public scrutiny will it act, imo."

"Such behavior is common enough that it even has its own Wikipedia page: 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_flag"
Or at least they appear to have expected it was coming.
And I take it they were doing this in an attempt to rig the market in their favor?
It's not illegal, but it violates the shit out of Reddit use terms and can get the whole sub banned.
Excellent write up. It's hard to Eli5 it.
Thank you! That was very informative. Wouldn’t it make sense though to make /r/bcc the cash subreddit instead of btc, which is bitcoin core on exchanges?
I watched the show on Netflix. Pretty interesting. Specifically -- is such an odd one because it's never taught in school as a proper way to write anything. It's clearly something one acquires and uses subconsciously. I'm not against alt accounts because realistically that's part of reddit appeal but if they are the same it's kind of funny and a cautionary tale
"The ""[evidence](https://imgur.com/9wEcp0a)"" of this in the post shows the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, a small list with only a couple dozen active posters, and it shows a half dozen other people using the -- mdash.  It is a fairly common convention.  Unless you're going to start claiming that I'm Peter R now..."

"What I really dont like is the lies, distortions and misrepresentation that BCH is Bitcoin and the takeover of /r/BTC by people with financial motivation to profit in order to artificially prop support for BCH by scamming new users.  They damage the reputation of the entire crypto community and perpetuate the idea BCH is a scamcoin.  

This problem could easily be solved if they migrated BCH talk to a BCH subreddit and cleaned up the topics in BTC to be about BTC.  Instead they purposely continue to misdirect and mislead through obfuscation."
"I'm not sure I understand the metaphor. Is throwing bad trees into the fire a metaphor for killing people?

(Sorry,  not trolling (much). I recognise this is probably a religious quote of some kind - just interested in what it means)"
Why do you think /r/btc exist at all? 
"Part of the reason why ""just creating new subreddit/forum/whatever"" is insatisfactory in many ways is that rbitcoin used to be one of the main rallying points for the community and still today people go there to learn what bitcoin is who will encounter a highly sanitized front and a community where a huge chunk of the members who made what bitcoin is today are outright banned. This has included CEOs of major bitcoin companies as well as CEOS of smaller but important for adoption.  The original developer of Bitcoin right after Satoshi and others like him would post there and now of course don't set foot on that cesspool.

Further note that r/bitcoin is now the base for brigading, not only in reddit but on google store, itunes, etc and that impacts sutff that is discussed at r/btc."
The problem is new users are misled in r/bitcoin. A private company has taken control and is lying to unsuspecting visitors for profit. 
Nobody brought up the coin at all. This is an obvious false flag attack with criminal activity you fucking sock puppet.
"> Who has this much time and money to spin up such a consipiracy? 

People like you who are scared of losing money and so they spend their time trying to attack the other side."

Segwit coin wouldn't exist without the ""worse idea"".

Evidence matters very little to you doesn't it?
so your comment doesnt downvoted by bots :)
"**Theory**: the r/Bitcoin mods are feeling heat from the reddit admins because of the massive number of removals, censorship, bad PR, the stolen donations, etc.  Or they are anticipating such pressure in the future, as I know users here complain and the OP is compiling a very compelling database of data (in addition to the very clear and sourced Blocke articles).


They told the admins it was a necessity because of vote manipulation.  This is their way of proving that while scoring some brownie points for their users.


Your thoughts, /u/spez and /u/sodypop?  I'm a 10+ year redditor, I've talked to both you and kn0thing in person once, I was one of the first subscribers to Gold back when it was a pure donation and I donated quite a bit, etc.  I started and managed a community that evolved into a top 20 subreddit, which I modded for years (so I know the game, the tools, etc.).  I am not OK with what is going on in r/Bitcoin, and I am unable to comment there for my political views.  I have been accused of socking, botting, trolling, doxxing, etc. by those mods and I promise you I did none of the above.


In an age of media manipulation I find the services OP is providing invaluable.  To OP: I would support open sourcing all this data in full and allowing researchers to have at it.


Let's not forget, by the way, that only one of these subreddits has public mod logs.  That speaks *volumes*."

"Oh I was not at all questioning your methodology. It is pretty common practice for establishing authorship in other fields by examining repetetive grammatical constructions and vocabulary usage. I had a graduate course in Shakespeare that delved into authorship through these type of studies.

/r/bitcoin is a subreddit which supports bitcoin CORE which has the ticker symbol BTC on exchanges. /r/btc is a subreddit which supports bitcoin CASH (a fork off of bitcoin core) which goes by BCH on exchanges. 
"rBitcoin became a heavily censored sub and banned nearly half the community. They allied themselves with a private corporation called Blockstream which usurped development in 2013-2014. Until that point most of the community wanted to upgrade the network with bigger blocks. Blockstream didn't want that though since their business model requires smaller blocks to force people to use their product from which they collect fees.

rBTC became the free speech reddit. "
I agree. If Reddit doesn't take internal action then the next step is to alert external authorities. Reddit may be complicit as well.
lol, is this a Chinese proverb or of your own creation?
Because they have become a cancerous tumour not just in the bitcoin sphere but to cryptocurrencies in general.   In r\bitcoin the banks now have a foothold on crypto.
This sub is created only cos r/bitcoin became a propaganda machine
"r/btc talks about BITCOIN

Bitcoin Cash is the descendant of Bitcoin - the closest version of the original.

BTC is another descendant of Bitcoin - the brother to BCH.

Both are Bitcoin.

If a sub was about General Electric stock & the stock had a split to A shares and B shares, the sub would talk about A & B shares.

However, r/bitcoin deletes all discussion not only of BCH, but it also deletes discussion of Bitcoin that is outside of the ""approved speech.""  Massive censorship over there.

At r/btc you can talk about BCH, BTC, Bitcoin Gold, or any other Bitcoin discussion you want."
Keep commenting and upvoting.
Gotta educate the newcomers 
"If you bought Bitcoin because you believed in freeing yourself from banker control then sell your btc for bch immediately.

Btc is just bitcoin by name and first move advantage. It has been subverted by bankers to keep their system going, not the true spirit of Bitcoin.

Imagine if there was a way to cryptographically prove your identity using a distributed database scattered across a peer-to-peer network!
"For years the Bitcoin developers were debating how to scale Bitcoin. One group of devs, the originals who the inventor of Bitcoin passed development onto when he left, wanted to increase the blocksize as was long the plan. Most of the community agree with this since it was the plan from the start. 

But a second group of devs who had worked their way into development were insisting... on doing nothing. Not scaling. No improving the network so more people could use it. Instead they wanted to transform Bitcoin into a settlement network and make it more like banking 2.0... rather than the P2P cash system it already was. When the original top dog dev Gaven Andresen stepped down from his power position... these new devs swept in and quickly filled the power vacuum, created a company called Blockstream, and usurped Bitcoin development. Within a year or so in August 2015 Theymos the mod of rbitcoin decided to ally with these new devs and censor anyone who disagreed with them instead of allowing for open debate. The community was immediately fragmented and divided.  "
This is premature. /u/nullc is such a revered figure by Core fanboys that it would hardly be a surprise to find someone following him around and aping his arguments and writing style. 
Exactly
No, needs mods changed.
LOL You thought the Central Bankers who control a $100 trillion dollar business are going to sit back while a bunch of crypto nerds horn in on their business?  and do it for free?
You can pay in btc

No, that's what all **bankers** do to every national currency.
Greg Maxwell is fucked.
r/bitcoin mods and a C level executive at Blockstream hacked a bunch of reddit accounts and manipulated vote counts on their own r/bitcoin forum before posting that r/btc was to blame for it.  The account hacking bit is very against the law and could go to jail for hacking.
Alas I am banned (along with half of Reddit I imagine.)
Criminals sticking up for the banking cartel, it's nothing new, just sad to see what the bitcoin name has been tarnished by.
(the same goes for trying to discredit the other side using the same means.) Also - great work by the researchers.

We have also seen many of the default subs bought out by political interest groups like ShareBlue and the result is that an impartial opinion on /r/politics, /r/news or /r/worldnews is now non-existent, they are all just echo-chambers. 

  We have mods that moderate hundreds or thousands of subs. We see people being banned from subreddits they have never visited just because of their participation in another sub. We see mods abuse power to ban users from multiple subreddits for one infraction, or with no infractions in some cases. Often these bans come with no explanation and questioning them leads to simply being muted (why does this option exist?). We see a multitude of censored comments in any thread about a remotely sensitive topic.  

  It is clear that the administrators are happy to let these abuses of power persist and happy to let the site become a hyper-politicised safe-zone for liberals. We've seen the site's algorithms changed to target one specific sub which doesn't go along with the narrative, /r/The_Donald, hiding posts from that sub from the front page even though they were happy to let /r/SandersForPresident take over the front page during the 2016 primaries. We also saw an astonishing action taken by the CEO of reddit, Steve Huffman, where /r/The_Donald's users' comments were personally shadow-edited by Steve himself in an act of petty retaliation for the criticism he received, which says a lot about the type of character he is.  

  Finally, the direction the site has been taking lately is very discouraging, as they aim to become a new Facebook. We are now seeing Facebook-like user profiles and a Facebook-like card-view homepage to go along with the Facebook-like quality of content that reddit has sank to, and it looks like the mission to turn reddit into another social media site is well underway, making this a great time to leave.  

  As an act of protest, I have chosen to redact all the comments I've ever made on reddit, overwriting them with this annoying message. I've had some gilded comments, made some funny jokes, given some good advice and started pointless arguments, but now they will all be turned into this, as I delete my profile and take back every comment.  

   If you would like to do the same, install [TamperMonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) for Chrome, [GreaseMonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) for Firefox, [NinjaKit](https://github.com/os0x/NinjaKit) for Safari, [Violent Monkey](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/violent-monkey/) for Opera, or [AdGuard](http://adguard.com/) for Internet Explorer (in Advanced Mode), then add [this Monkey script](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/10905-reddit-overwrite-extended).  

 Finally, click on your username at the top right corner of reddit, click on the comments tab, and click on the new OVERWRITE button at the top of the page. You may need to scroll down to multiple comment pages if you have commented a lot.!

"I believe everything to be true as if you look at all the links and evidence it all backs up every claim made. Evidence is evidence. Whether people choose to willfully ignore it is on them, unfortunately. There are still plenty of people that will be brain washed coming from /r/bitcoin, BitcoinTalk, etc. 

Why this was done has become blatantly obvious. The mods of /r/bitcoin are clearly working with Blockstream employees/Core Devs to manipulate the market in their favor. We've seen this time and time again now for at least two years; but now there is evidence and facts to prove it and back it up. How Blockstream/Bitcoin Core devs were able to get /r/bitcoin mods in their back pocket, isn't yet known, but seems also painfully obvious being that Greg Maxwell and theymos have a long standing relationship going back to BitcoinTalk, Greg being a paid staffer there, theymos working with Warren Togami (Blockstream exec) on the Slickage forum embezzlement, and more. The rabbit hole goes very far down and this only scratches the surface. But for the first time we have actual proof that is undeniable that the two groups actively work together to manipulate the market.

I'm also highly skeptical of the tether scam happening right now and what role that plays with Bitfinex and Blockstream. That is still developing, but more news I'm sure will come of that in due time. "

It says that Blockstream and r/bitcoin admins hacked r/bitcoin users accounts and then used them to give the false perception that enemies of r/bitcoin were doing it.  In particular the CTO of Blockstream and Core Dev Greg Maxwell is implicated in criminal hacking activity.
People's magic, flawless internet money is being toyed with or sth.

"Surprise, no, but it is the first time there is strong evidence linking him to being at minimum complicit in criminal hacking activity if not the hacker of the reddit accounts himself.

If you think about the implications can anyone trust any software Blockstream puts out after these revelations so long as Greg is in the C suite at Blockstream?"
More like report it to the FBI.  They investigate stuff like this.  I'm sure they would love to take down a corrupt company in the Bitcoin space.  Maybe they can Seize Greg's Litecoin and auction it off too.

It's very relevant.  /r/btc is being controlled by moderators with financial interests in an alt coin.  Even in the OP they show that /r/btc was astroturfed with bots to support BCH, except they blame it on people from /r/bitcoin despite the fact the lead moderator (Ver) is using it as a marketing channel for BCH.
Yeah, I know they are bad. I just don't want to burn them to death. (Even if they really are witches :-)
Agree if it were just a random reddit account hacking they wouldn't care.  This involves a major company in the Bitcoin Space though.  If they dig in they will find some sleezy stuff.  The Reddit account hacking is just the tip of the iceberg.
This is bad enough to warrant some initial probing. I doubt it would take long before a whole bunch of other terrible shit would be revealed to them because Greg and his minions are sloppy dumbasses.

Well in this case, the content is talking to yourself in an effort to make your point seem more legitimate and appearing to be in cahoots with a hacking plot to disrupt and misinform.

are you everyone?
for the last fucking time: yes, hacking accounts is illegal.
How so? Do others not do this same thing? One would easily assume yes. Plus it's not against Reddit rules to open multiple accounts.
Well, my node never actually went down despite the DDOS... So even that part was bullshit. =)

tl;dr most /r/bitcoin readers are noobs and technical discussion is far more prevalent on /r/btc"
"Well I'm not aware of anything like this but it is either a service where you provide a subreddit and the hackers comes back to you with a list of hacked account

OR since u/nullc is very skilled could have pulled it himself indeed. Actually any skilled dev could have done this

- Get the list of all r/bitcoin and r/btc (super easy)

- run a dictionary attack on them (super easy) to get all the accounts using shitty password of type 1234,1111 and all the other common easy one

Both of these subreddit have 100'000+ users so it is statistically easy to find enough accounts with crappy passwords this way.

But any way, both are illegal and whoever did it will face jail time 

u/nullc is probably shitting is cyber punk pants as we speak"
Honestly you can accuse people of shilling, fake accounts, bad intentions, lying etc but hacking really is on a different level

Oooo, buying known stolen property.  Also a crime.  I'm skeptical though because how else do you account for such a high percentage of the hacked accounts being r/bitcoin users?  They must have told the hacker they wanted users who frequent r/bitcoin or done it themselves.
Had. The issues have since been fixed but yes, they found a way to send certain data that would cause the node to crash and as soon as the operator would restart it they would just attack it again.  eventually people found the problem they were exploiting and fixed it stopping the attack. 
Yeah it's a stretch to suggest actual links to illegal activities. I wouldn't be surprised given everything that's happening right now and the subjects they censor, but the link is weak... so far.
Yes. So? They've been doing this for years. What makes you think they'll stop now unless there is a much more significant public outcry?
If they're choosing sides for such an egregious act we should seriously question why we're here. There's other options, especially within the cryptocurrency community.

"I think that the small blockers are feeling increasingly desperate and are running out of tricks to win the currency competition, so they're trying desperate tricks such as false flags even though they know that the negative effects of getting discovered are high. They fear a potential cashening (also called ""flippening"") event because they instinctively know that LN with routing for millions of users is a technology that's not going to be invented, implemented and adopted for many years.

The small blockers know that if they don't use immoral tricks then the Bitcoin users and speculators will choose the Bitcoin version that already has scaling solved directly on-chain and today: Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin Segwit is intentionally retarded to only 6 transactions per second so it's not really a competition even. It's like running a marathon when your main competitor has chosen to (voluntarily and for no good reason) only use one leg."
I am a total noob who wandered into here from /r/all. All I do is follow the price of BTC. Isn't this sub and r/bitcoin using the same currency?
"That's still too side v. side for me. There are people with hundreds of millions of dollars on the line here. All that's happening is pumps and dumps and distractions so that everyone else is worried about /r/bitcoin vs. /r/btc. 

A large amount of the mining network switch over because of the broken difficulty adjustment algorithm in BCH. For those few days, BCH was something like 3x more profitable to mine. Also during that time, we saw the largest trading volumes of all time, with suspicious spikes where BCH was trading at 2x volume over all other coins on just a few exchanges. After the difficulty adjusted again, trading volume fell, and BCH/BTC price has been falling pretty consistently (albeit, slowly).

Look, what I'm saying is that people making these markets move and buying mods don't care about subreddit debates, and honestly, probably don't really care about tech discussions. There are fortunes being made while we bikeshed who is on the right side of the blocksize increase. 

That's my tinfoil hat theory, but think about it - would you put this kind of market manipulation and propaganda past the CEO's and billionaires that play in the conventional stock market?

"I've been very coherent and rational.  I even outlined a very simple solution.  The sub is out of control and off topic and has been for awhile and the moderators have no interest in cleaning it up.  I've made a top level thread before to express that very thought, that they should clean up the discussions to be about btc and make a bch subreddit and got buried in downvotes by the cultists of /r/btc.

There is direct evidence the shilling for BCH in /r/btc is the product of the moderators of /r/btc themselves who have actual motive to push BCH where /r/bitcoin has none whatsoever.  It's not a false flag attack, it's an astroturfing operation to build support for BCH.  Go look at the volume of posts shilling for BCH in /r/btc.  The entire subreddit is dedicated to BCH despite being named /r/btc.  They push BCH products and services.  They perpetuate lies that BCH is the real bitcoin.  The user base actively trashes BTC.  That's not some conspiracy of users from /r/bitcoin doing that, thats the users and moderators of /r/btc.

I dont see /r/bitcoin trying to move products and services in such brazen ways.  Their moderators dont push their own companies and services.  This entire post is a bunch of lies and misdirection like every other topic in /r/btc.  Go troll the subreddit.  90% of the stories on the first page will be about BCH.

"**False flag**

The contemporary term false flag describes covert operations that are designed to deceive in such a way that activities appear as though they are being carried out by individual entities, groups, or nations other than those who actually planned and executed them.

Lance deHaven-Smith states that ""The term “false flag” originally referred to pirate ships that flew flags of the home countries of the ships they were approaching to attack and board. The pirates used the false flag as a disguise to prevent their victims from fleeing or preparing for battle. The term today extends beyond naval encounters to include countries that organize attacks on themselves and make the attacks appear to be by enemy nations or terrorists, thus giving the nation that was supposedly attacked a pretext for domestic repression and foreign military aggression.""

Operations carried out during peace-time by civilian organizations, as well as covert government agencies, can (by extension) also be called false flag operations if they seek to hide the real organization behind an operation.

Some other fun facts about Bitfinex - 

* They are an investor in Blockstream
* Their CEO admitted to wash trading and insider trading 
* They were hacked last year for $72 million and hacker has never been caught 
* Adam Back and Greg Maxwell have a special relationship with them. After the hack last year they were caught in a scandal to not release payment for identifying hacker
* Bitfinex used Bitgo to auto approve all txs in their massive hack (Bitgo also heavily aligned with Blockstream) 
* Bitfinex is a partner for upcoming Blockstream Liquid sidechain 
* Bitfinex works closely with Blockstream to undermine Bitcoin Cash calling it “bcash” 
* Bitfinex also is owner of Tether (shell company)
* Bitfinex issued new tethers to pump SegWitCoin 
* Tether “hacked” to cover losses on Bitfinex "

Why does it say excellent match then? 
It's actually the opposite.  If one user controls two accounts, it's unlikely they'll post within *a few seconds* of each other. However, just by random chance, we'd expect two separately-controlled accounts to post within a few seconds of each other. (The exact expected minimum gap is shown.) So, if the gap is **much higher** than the expected gap, it's more likely that they're controlled by the same user.

"As a reader of /r/bitcoin (and this sub too obvs) this is a concerning accusation. But it seems there is still no actual proof here of wrong doing.

This is not the case. I've been reading on the sub since a year or two and the vote counts have always been visible to me. I think there is a period of ~~1h~~ 12h after posting where they are not visible, but after that period everyone can see them"
No idea what this wall of text says and I don't care.
I think this detective work is pretty awesome. Is this just bad for the rBitcoin sub or is it also bad for Bitcoin? I see that the r/btc folks would like to have BCH replace BTC.

The sloppiness doesn't surprise me.

You could even make the fuzzy search smarter than just regexes; plug in one of the many pre-existing libraries that do NLP. Again, very tough to detect an account that would do that, besides maybe using DNA sequencing algorithms to detect repeated patterns? Like there’s so many ways to do this that it’s not even funny. And soon enough we’ll have so much misinformation that we won’t be able to tell a real conversation from one that isn’t, kind of like r/politics. It’s the new spam of our age. It cost almost nothing to make, and the websites are wholly unequipped to filter it. And like spam, it isn’t that complicated to do. So yeah, expect this problem to become exponentially worse."

They essentially drained as much wealth as they could from people who were unprepared for the impending price swings they knew they were about to cause. They drained the people who panic-sold and panic-bought at the worst possible times. It's fucking criminal, really. Insider trading, basically.

"Regardless of whether you support Bitcoin (legacy/core) or Bitcoin Cash, if you engage in hacking, bot voting/posting, opportunistic propaganda, you are harming your project. Just don't do it. 

One of the hallmarks of the bitcoin debate on twitter has been fake accounts liking posts (30-50 likes really suddenly by people with accounts that only have 50 or so followers, and just look a bit too obviously trying to be 'normal'), trolling people, and amplifying messages (propaganda). My suspicion is that the same people who engage in this crow about having 'the community' on their side - in other words they have no ethics or credibility and are just toxic people incapable of self reflection. Just don't do this, even if you see the other side doing it. "

"This thread looks bad. Not for u/nullc but more for r/btc. There simply isn't enough evidence to say that u/nullc is u/4n4n4. It's possible but there is NOT enough evidence. 

The reasoning behind removing the votes displayed limit by the r/Bitcoin moderator make sense. They don't prove anything.

It is possible that is was all a r/bitcoin conspiracy but it is equally possible that it was someone from r/btc who did that. There is nothing in this posts that provides much evidence for either things.

The upvotes and the number of times this post has been gilded makes me suspicious that most people here are merely wishing for it to be a r/bitcoin conspiracy, whether there be any evidence for it or not.

If anyone can dig deeper and prove anything about what happened with the account hacks, that would be welcome but I am afraid this post does not provide enough evidence for anything.

This thread is almost as unproductive as the several vote brigading threads yesterday on r/Bitcoin front page. Let's not get distracted over petty squabbles and focus on more productive conversation. :)"
How anyone can back BTC that does stuff like this is beyond me.  It goes against the entire spirit of cryptocurrency and what we hope to achieve with it.  This is why we support BCH.  We aren't trying to support some altcoin, we just want Bitcoin to be what it used to be, a way to change the world for the better.

There's only one thread to read through.  Before compiling your evidence, just read the one thread all the way through to make sure you didn't miss anything.

My guess on the whole ""attack"" was that it was a poorly programmed bot going wild.  Likely the bot was programmed to downvote comments 20 times an hour and the programmer missed a decimal place on a timer and it went wild with 200 votes a second.

"Wow, epic, standing ovation! This confirms what we have suspected all along.  The criminal activity associated with Bitcoin Core / Blockstream goes all the way to the top.  If true this means that their CTO Greg Maxwell is at minimum complicit in criminal activity if not directly carrying it out or directing others to do so himself.

I've always been suspicious of the claim that the folks doing illegal things in the name of supporting Core are just some fanatics not directly associated with Core or Blockstream.  While people have been suspicious of Blockstream Core for a while this is the first time there is very direct and compelling evidence implicating Greg Maxwell.  Many of us assumed they were also behind the criminal attacks on XT, Classic, and Unlimited nodes but didn't have any proof.

"
"If I remember correctly Gregory Maxwell often refers to the ""Bitcoin Core project"" as ""the Bitcoin project"" which is quite unusual. Here's /u/4n4n4 also referring to the Bitcoin Core project as ""the Bitcoin project"" just as if there are no other (competing) node client projects such as Bitcoin Unlimited existing:

http://archive.is/2qfrJ#selection-2021.0-2021.55

It sure sounds like they're the same person. If it turns out that they are the same person then I feel a little embarrassed on Gregory's behalf because it's quite sad to invent a whole other person or (political) [wingman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wingman_\(social\)) like that."

By doing this they have flat out broken the policy of the site... Other subreddits have been banned because of this.
I'm not surprised either, just really pissed off at this point.
Paging u/adam3us, what do you feel about a C-level executive in your company that might be involved in criminal activity that goes against the ethos of the community which you and all other companies within the Bitcoin sphere relies on? Personally, I find this kind of behavior disgraceful and completely unacceptable, and would take above accusation very seriously. If we as a community want to persevere and replace the legacy banking system, we cannot be seen as a bunch of authistic hackers. It is just bad branding.
Probably on the run

Welcome home.
"/u/spez I once shied away from replying to you reddit admins when you asked me (u/PsyRev) what I meant by r/bitcoin being run badly by Theymos and doing bad things to ruin bitcoin. I didn't feel I had enough to give and I was leaving reddit (deleted my account as you see) at the time, so I figured you'd hear my plea and see for yourself in time.

Here we are now and I hope you're watching or that you'll be watching what's happening. This thread is a good indication of at least part of what's going on, so I'll leave it at that."
"> But he seems to be careful not to post at the same time.

Wouldn't two posts at the *same* time would be counter-evidence?"
"> (closer to zero is better match; less than 1 is highly suspicious)

~~That sounds like a typo...~~


edit: nevermind"
"FWIW, one of my throwaways comes back as ""timezones not significantly matched"" and a pretty high (>3) word distance, making it an ""Unlikely sockpuppet.""   
I've not made any attempt to change my writing style or watch when I post, etc.

I'm guessing the tool is rather conservative, and would rather miss some connections than incorrectly detect them.

"
It might be worth mentioning the tool's overall takeaway on this one: **Unlikely Sockpuppet**
"To be fair, the conclusion is ""unlikely sockpuppet"" based on the post timings. (I wrote this script.)

It's meant to be more specific than sensitive. That is, I tried to reduce false-positives as much as possible. "

/u/sodypop ignores all requests to comment on /r/bitcoin censorship. Go figure.
Bitcoin lives on in Bitcoin Cash
"> Bitcoin was supposed to help us eliminate the banks

It is still doing that - but not at BTC anymore - Blockstream IS the banks."
"""Criminal activity"". LOLOLOLOLOLOL"

It is saddening .. indeed..
"Thank you for doing this. More evidence to collect. I'm going to compile the links related to r/Bitcoin and Blockstream and post them.

/u/tippr $.1"
Isn't hacking a criminal matter?
"TL;DR? "
Just one we know about..he has a history of using sock puppets going back to his wikipedia years.
Can you expound on the criminality you're referencing?  I'm not casting doubt, but reddit vote manipulation isn't illegal, so I'm interested in what else they've done that we should know about. 
The most telling aspect of this is the solid link of \/u\/nullc (Greg Maxwell of Blockstream) to the \/r\/bitcoin mods. It proves (again) they have been working together to manipulate both subs.
Good bot
Wow /u/nullc you are famous now! Congratulation!!
Initiate Operation Dragonslayer
Bitcoin Cash yes
Exactly. Great post.
"I don't know who this censorship_notifier group/person is, but damn... you are excellent. Hopefully this is your work and you actually get paid for this.

I feel like watching Spotlight right now. Real detective work has been done and things uncovered that many have suspected for a long time. Reddit admins better react to this. Will probably take some days/weeks for them to analyze the facts and do further investigation though."
"The technical term is ""false flag"".

>  If our claims here are true, surely some type of strong action is warranted. 

Nothing will happen. I have been in this game long enough to know that Reddit is NOT on our side."
Smoke everywhere.  /u/bashco clearly had knowledge of what was about to happen, BEFORE it happened. CU-2 is also damning.  That was not a hacked account and gave more fuel for the bot to upvote.  /u/spez /u/sodypop wtf is going on here?
"HOLY. FUCK.

If this doesn't get Reddit admin's attention I don't think anything will. But that doesn't matter as much. Why do people in Bitcoin allow this shit to carry on? This is BLACK AND WHITE PROOF of rBitcoin mods and Blockstream forming a cartel to take over Bitcoin. WTF! 

I'm extra bullish on Bitcoin Cash now!!"
"**Wingman (social)**

Wingman is a role that a person may take when a friend needs support with approaching potential sexual or romantic partners. A wingman is someone who is on the ""inside"" and is used to help someone with intimate relationships. In general, one person's wingman will help him or her avoid attention from undesirable prospective partners or attract desirable ones, or both.

Absolutely, its all feasible.  The pieces are slowly falling into place.  Sure it is pixie dust but if you are very good at what you do and stick with it an income could be derived.
