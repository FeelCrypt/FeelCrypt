This would have easily hit /r/all over the next few hours had the massive net neutrality battle kicked off tonight.
"This is merely scratching the surface. Any veteran programmer will tell you how easy it is to set up the code for bots. Just using a RNN, like say https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn can turn up enough semi-logical content to make some hard to automatically detect karma farming. And this isn’t even using anything remotely specialized. The fact is, if I could see myself be able to do this for fun (I am a veteran programmer), then for sure there’s team that are monetarily backed that have done the legwork already. Not that there’s that much to do. You can easily set up some pre-written conversation topics with some minor variations, code some fuzzy search and have bots automatically respond with your propaganda. You could even make the fuzzy search smarter than just regexes; plug in one of the many pre-existing libraries that do NLP. Again, very tough to detect an account that would do that, besides maybe using DNA sequencing algorithms to detect repeated patterns? Like there’s so many ways to do this that it’s not even funny. And soon enough we’ll have so much misinformation that we won’t be able to tell a real conversation from one that isn’t, kind of like r/politics. It’s the new spam of our age. It cost almost nothing to make, and the websites are wholly unequipped to filter it. And like spam, it isn’t that complicated to do. So yeah, expect this problem to become exponentially worse."

We already know that Blockstream is owned and run by Federal Reserve Banks.  Bankers have used black hat tricks for decades (centuries) to influence national and international politics to bend policy to their will.

These kinds of tactics should be no surprise to anyone who knows who/what Blockstream is."
"The really ironic thing here is that they pretend to stay away from BCH, yet these fork-tongued snakes likely bought it in droves before running this false flag operation and made millions, possibly billions in the process. Think about how much the price went up in the days leading up to this.

They essentially drained as much wealth as they could from people who were unprepared for the impending price swings they knew they were about to cause. They drained the people who panic-sold and panic-bought at the worst possible times. It's fucking criminal, really. Insider trading, basically. If this were a regulated market these fucks would have been subpoenaed by now."

"Regardless of whether you support Bitcoin (legacy/core) or Bitcoin Cash, if you engage in hacking, bot voting/posting, opportunistic propaganda, you are harming your project. Just don't do it. 

One of the hallmarks of the bitcoin debate on twitter has been fake accounts liking posts (30-50 likes really suddenly by people with accounts that only have 50 or so followers, and just look a bit too obviously trying to be 'normal'), trolling people, and amplifying messages (propaganda). My suspicion is that the same people who engage in this crow about having 'the community' on their side - in other words they have no ethics or credibility and are just toxic people incapable of self reflection. Just don't do this, even if you see the other side doing it. "

I didn't feel I had enough to give and I was leaving reddit (deleted my account as you see) at the time, so I figured you'd hear my plea and see for yourself in time.

Here we are now and I hope you're watching or that you'll be watching what's happening. This thread is a good indication of at least part of what's going on, so I'll leave it at that."

The most telling aspect of this is the solid link of \/u\/nullc (Greg Maxwell of Blockstream) to the \/r\/bitcoin mods. It proves (again) they have been working together to manipulate both subs.
"Wow, epic, standing ovation! This confirms what we have suspected all along.  The criminal activity associated with Bitcoin Core / Blockstream goes all the way to the top.  If true this means that their CTO Greg Maxwell is at minimum complicit in criminal activity if not directly carrying it out or directing others to do so himself.

I've always been suspicious of the claim that the folks doing illegal things in the name of supporting Core are just some fanatics not directly associated with Core or Blockstream.  While people have been suspicious of Blockstream Core for a while this is the first time there is very direct and compelling evidence implicating Greg Maxwell.  Many of us assumed they were also behind the criminal attacks on XT, Classic, and Unlimited nodes but didn't have any proof.

"
"If I remember correctly Gregory Maxwell often refers to the ""Bitcoin Core project"" as ""the Bitcoin project"" which is quite unusual. Here's /u/4n4n4 also referring to the Bitcoin Core project as ""the Bitcoin project"" just as if there are no other (competing) node client projects such as Bitcoin Unlimited existing:

http://archive.is/2qfrJ#selection-2021.0-2021.55

It sure sounds like they're the same person. If it turns out that they are the same person then I feel a little embarrassed on Gregory's behalf because it's quite sad to invent a whole other person or (political) [wingman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wingman_\(social\)) like that."
Paging u/adam3us, what do you feel about a C-level executive in your company that might be involved in criminal activity that goes against the ethos of the community which you and all other companies within the Bitcoin sphere relies on? Personally, I find this kind of behavior disgraceful and completely unacceptable, and would take above accusation very seriously. If we as a community want to persevere and replace the legacy banking system, we cannot be seen as a bunch of authistic hackers. It is just bad branding.
Smoke everywhere.  /u/bashco clearly had knowledge of what was about to happen, BEFORE it happened. CU-2 is also damning.  That was not a hacked account and gave more fuel for the bot to upvote.  /u/spez /u/sodypop wtf is going on here?
"The technical term is ""false flag"".
