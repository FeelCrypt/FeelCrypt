"> Make non-important / meaningless. Yes.

You didn't take anything away from the gif this thread is about did you? You're parroting 'open source' as some infallible good just like the Cabinet members in the gif parrot 'decentralization.' 

Third parties can't possibly know the proper supply of a good to produce and the price at which it should be sold (see the Soviet Union, 1930's America). Only businesses in the space can determine that as informed by market demand. That the third party in question, Core, is open source doesn't mean they know any better the proper amount of supply in block space needed to meat the demand for Bitcoin block space anymore so than a dictator, a bureaucrat, or a group of democratically elected officials. Giving power to an open source project to set supply is as moronic as any of the latter mentioned groups. 

> Bitcoin has a secure chain. Humble up and be happy we have it / slow down.

I never said the chain wasn't secure, just that high fees aren't a result of the security but the artificially limited block space for transactions. We could have orders of magnitude more transactions included with the same amount of security/hashpower."
And you would need 100% consensus, otherwise it would cause a fork.
Not only this...but I believe we will have drive chains for localized trading regions where it will be still quite easy to run a node for these purposes (then you will do trustless atomic swaps between/among sidechain coins).

Perhaps less wise and more costly of your time, you could look at just the first point, or the summary at the end. 

In any case, here it is...

> neat technology for preventing replication of a digital token

Maybe that's the result, maybe not. It certainly isn't the stated goal and stated work.  

It seems this technology was theoretically meant to be decentralized or distributed, and that in practice, it is still the stated goal. In Bitcoin's case, the idea of non-centralization is in the literal title of the white paper as ""Peer-to-Peer."" 

In the case of other coins (and non-coin blockchain and blockchain-like projects), decentralization or distributed control is sometimes the main stated goal or at least a key element baked into the tech. Sure, the stated goals could be BS and/ or the practical reality could be a miss.

In fact, there have been notable failures and many claims of failure (naming particular private entities that could have inordinate or complete control). I remain unconvinced that it has been proven unsuccessful. 

I also don't see as much as hoped of the opposite of ""throwing logic out the window"".

To prove, with logic clearly kept fully inside the window, that decentralization and distributed control technology has failed utterly and can't succeed, I will seek the same arguments made earlier in a way I can hear better (or, if I'm not failing here, made in a better way--more complete, more conclusive, possibly completely differently made).

Perhaps I'll conclusively hear of the specific private entity, one each, that controls or will control a majority of each of the top currencies, as we're on the way to private entities to eventually control all of them. 

Even without specific entities, providing reasoned, thorough logic why failure and centralized control will eventually happen would be just as good as specific examples, if it were relatively air-tight.

The comments here have attempted the latter, I think--I'm just not seeing or fully-grasping the link between the ideas and their proof. The ideas certainly do support the conclusions, if they are proven.

The conclusions seem like a valid concern. They don't seem like a certainty. I remain open minded about them, as I remain open minded about decentralization and distributed control systems.

-------------------

NOTE: The following goes into governing and regulating banks. You're a saint if you got this far, and doubly so if you continue.

As for the government, banks, motives, regulations, history, and current developments--those things I know better than some. My education, upbringing (I grew up in the world of the now-defunct NY investment bankers), some of my work, and current direct knowledge is not fully consistent with what you describe about ""thousands of years"" and where we are.

Independent of what I'm seeing with my own eyes, the general public is also aware of tremendous failures of the government to function as independent of private entities, with the interest of the people over those entities--so much so that one or ten bullet points would understate and even misstate the case. Private individuals and groups have had tremendous success with influence and even direct control over legislation and regulation. The trend lately has famously, and with very clear detail, been the opposite of the suggested governance. 

I'm claiming this is well known, even infamous. Asking me to provide examples is not necessary for disagreeing or agreeing. If you don't agree and immediately think of more than a dozen non-edgelord headlines, key platform elements, proposed laws, protests, non-crypto ponzi schemes, failures in regulations, conflicts of interest, partial or serious evidence of plutocracy, etc., then we can, with confidence and finality, agree to disagree without going any further. Your time is valuable.

I'm not saying you agree with the conclusion that we have a plutocracy or are suffering from major related trends and developments. I'm suggesting you might know what I'm thinking of when I say government not being accountable enough can't be so quickly dismissed.   

Crypto may have failed to replace this ""advancement,"" but the advancement has rolled itself back quite notably, and quite outside the recognition of edgelords. 

2008 was mainly a failure of the problems with the ""advancement"". Our further failing to intelligently advocate a reduced version of Dodd-Frank (which is a failure of grown-up edgelords) could lead to the opposition doing more than a minor dilution of it. This will lead to bankers taking major risks, with no power (or desire) by the decision makers and enforcers in the government to mitigate them.

Put simply, if people worth $300 MM could be worth $1-2 billion or more, with only a 1-in-10 chance of another 2008, they'll not only take it, they'll fight tooth-and-nail for it, with power and a great likelihood of success. 

Run that last sentence by a conservative, non-edgelord expert. Not a professor--a banker. I stake there are people who take it seriously and have (and have earned) the opportunity to present it to several top government movements (Kasich, Warren, Clinton, Trump, Sanders all). Maybe there are plenty of ideas that are crazy that are presented at the highest levels. 2017 certainly has show that to happen. Still, this one rings true to me. 

By the way, that's the optimistic and/ or interest-conflicted view of those who stand a chance to put their worth in the billions. It is my understanding the risk is much worse than 1 in 10 and that the result could be worse than 2008 by a long shot.

Overall/ TL;DR:

I haven't grasped the explanation of the parts I'm still learning about (existing failures of decentralization; logical reasons that predetermine those failures; and/ or the tech not even attempting decentralization) in such a way that it stands as supported.

The parts I do know well directly contradict the generalizations and assertions made here about governance and regulation. "

"A block size increase would _obviously_ split the network because it is highly contentious. This much should be clear if you have paying attention for the last 6-24 months. 

Now, the reason it is contentious is because a lot of people believe it will result in validating nodes becoming harder to run thus leaving the network less trustless. Some feel that a doubling alone along with SegWit adoption, resulting in a max block size of 8MB is already too much. Others think it's probably fine but would be a slippery slope down towards more ""easy"" solutions."
We know that because it can be seen in already existing cryptos.
">If bitcoin is a system just to transfer bitcoin from wallet to wallet then its working perfectly and there's no problems.

That's actually exactly what bitcoin is. What else do you think it is?

Buying and selling bitcoin for other currencies on an exchange does not use the bitcoin network. No actual transactions are confirmed on the bitcoin blockchain when you buy or sell BTC on an exchange. On-exchange trades do not contribute to the 350,000 transactions per day, *which are coins being sent from one bitcoin address to another bitcoin address.*

If you were to buy an apple with some dogecoin, you would send some coin from your dogecoin wallet to the merchant's dogecoin wallet. This is using dogecoin as a currency.

If you owed someone $100 and you made an agreement to pay them in IOTA, you would send some coin from your IOTA wallet to their IOTA wallet. This is using IOTA as a currency.

If you wanted to give someone a gift, and sent some ether to them with a touching birthday message, you would send some coin from your ethereum wallet to their ethereum wallet. This is using ether as a currency.

A currency settles debts. Period. That's what it is.

>Actual metrics of how many merchants accept it

Not being accepted by merchants does not equal not being used at all. You wouldn't say that gold is useless because merchants don't accept it. You wouldn't say that cheeseburgers are useless because merchants don't accept it. You wouldn't say that American Express is useless because it's only accepted at 1 of the 2 grocery stores you go to. These toenail clippers are not useless because I can't open my beer with them!

The data is there and easy to interpret. If it's used one time, then it's used one time and you can't truthfully say it is ""not being used"" or it's ""useless"". It obviously was useful for that one person, one time. The word ""useful"" does not mean ""useful for you, personally"".

Bitcoin is used about 350,000 times every single day. That is a simple fact.

>Actual metrics of how many merchants accept it, and how many black markets accept it are down, not up.

I was a late adopter in late 2011 and to me, actually using bitcoin was more important than HODLing as a store of (potential value). I could buy and sell and transfer in seconds for practically no fee whatsoever.

I can't imagine how new adopters can wrap their heads around what is going on and although I don't have or hold any BCH just legacy, I'm starting to wonder whether the teams that work with legacy infrastructure have bitcoins best interest in mind.

It needs to be simplified and the power needs to be given back to the people,  not a bunch of miners and Dev's essentially holding progress hostage.

"Yes it was a compromise. It doesn’t matter who was at the fucking meeting. Sometimes you have representatives handling major issues for everyone. It didn’t need to be made into a sinister, evil plot. It wasn’t. 

The reason they’re not adopting it now is because there is no on chain scaling. SW was only half of the agreement. That’s why they’re not adopting it. Your entire perception of reality is  skewed. No offense."
Blocksize is independent of hash rate. Bitcoin is only expensive because the central planners of Core have set an artificial cap on supply of block space. If BCH had the same share of hash rate BTC has now it would have the same level of security but fees would remain low due to free block space.
At this point - who cares.... I think they got the bitcoin that they wanted... great for them.  We should be reinforcing their active decision to remain at 1 megabyte.  This was a hard four years in the making.

"Any use of bitcoin is necessarily a wallet to wallet transfer. I don’t understand why you’re differentiating between using it to make a payment and using it as a currency. It’s literally the same thing.

How can it be used as a currency without coin being transferred wallet to wallet?

“Being used as a currency” is not the same thing as “exchanged with a merchant for goods and services”.

If your grandma gave you a $100 bill for Christmas, that was her using dollars as a currency.

The primary function of a currency is to settle debts.

>Bitcoins market share has gone from over 90% to under 35%. If you think its usefulness as a currency is either A) irrelevant or B) not decreasing, then look forward to seeing that share drop to 0 eventually.


Market share is relative. In an growing market, a commodity can have increasing usage while having a declining market share.

You keep saying its use is decreasing, but the [data](https://blockchain.info/charts/n-transactions) indicates otherwise. "
"I don't understand why you seem to think this is a fight.

What I am saying here is that this post is misrepresenting the connection between block size and decentralization, and the argument for the bitcoin blockchain keeping it's current block size.

Cryptocurrencies are financial instruments. You should be thinking rationally and economically about them... not emotionally as if they are sports teams with rival fandoms.

>You could try actually saying something substantive.

This post is literally just misrepresenting people's position and calling people names for disagreeing. If you're here to make sure people are saying things that are substantive, then isn't it hypocritical to be attacking me for pointing out how misleading and unsubstantial this post is?

>Are you OK with the current bitcoin (ftfy) transaction fees?

Have I come to terms with existing in a Universe that contains a cryptocurrency named ""bitcoin"" that has a 1GB block size and transaction fees of a few dozen dollars? I promise you that I am not losing a single second of sleep over it, because of all the things that are good ideas to become emotionally involved in, the monetary policy of financial instruments is not one of them.

Do I think that bitcoin core have made the best decision about block size? I don't know. I do know that this post is not helping anyone make a rational decision about that, because it is inaccurate and intellectually dishonest.

Bitcoin is a financial instrument. When I need to use a financial instrument, I think rationally and economically and pick the right instrument for my use. I don't hold grudges against the instruments which are not useful to me, and neither should you.

You seem to be implying (by asking if I am ""OK"" with the current BTC transaction fees) that you are ""not OK"" with them. What exactly do you mean? In what sense are you ""not OK"" with it? It offends you? It goes against your religion? You believe there should be a moderate adjustment to policy?
 You can't tolerate sharing a Universe with it? You think it's unethical? You can imagine some unintended negative consequences? You think it's an evil plot to overthrow peace and justice? What are you trying to ask? What exactly do you mean by ""OK""?"

What markets do you see as needing a solution? I'd love to hear it."
">I don’t understand why you’re differentiating between using it to make a payment and using it as a currency.

I'm differentiating between buying and selling bitcoin as an asset with currency, and using it as a currency to buy/sell goods and services.

There's a meaningful difference between these two concepts, I don't care what words you want to use to describe these two concepts, we can use whatever words you want (i prefer ""currency"" and ""asset""), so long as we actually establish there's a meaningful difference between these two things, and have different words to describe them.

buying and selling or transferring ownership an asset doesn't make it a currency. trading for goods and services does. increased daily transactions does not prove use as currency is up when the vast majority of those transactions are on exchanges. All that shows is more people are speculating on the price and buying and selling it as an asset. Actual metrics of how many merchants accept it, and how many black markets accept it are down, not up.

 If people stopped driving cars as much and I said ""car use is down"", and you responded with ""but people are still buying and selling the same number of cars so thats not true"", we are clearly not talking about the same thing. It's a semantic game to use two different definitions of the word ""use"" and pretend that there isn't really any difference between driving a car and buying and selling a car because its all just ""using"" cars.

>How can it be used as a currency without coin being transferred wallet to wallet?

The fact using it as a currency would require moving it from wallet to wallet (which it actually doesn't if you bought things by physically handing over a pen drive with keys), doesn't mean any time it moves from wallet to wallet its being used as a currency. If its not being used as a medium of exchange its just people buying and selling it for fiat. It is what is being exchanged.

>If your grandma gave you a $100 bill for Christmas, that was her using dollars as a currency.

Just because you can transfer ownership of a currency doesn't mean anything you transfer ownership of is a currency. 

You're abstracting currency down to some abstract you can ""use"" or ""transfer"", ignoring the actual definition of currency which is a medium of exchange used to buy and sell goods and service. Just because you can ""use"" or ""transfer"" something doesn't make it a currency.

Ok, I had a major misscoeception about LN channels, I thought coins could hop from one channel to another, your metal rod with beads in makes more sense and suffers less from what I described (but still Bob could close the channel and move the coins to another wallet, risking losing all the coins in that channel, but if he spent them all he has nothing to lose and everything to win by doing it)
"> you go to buy a coffee from the shop, but find that your channel with the shop does not have enough funds to pay for the coffee... because Bob already spent your channels balance to pay Carol.

So how does what you said make any sense?"
lighting.network
Then Bitcoin Cash has a problem because Bitcoin Core will work again like it is suppose to. But Bitcoin Core also has a problem because raising the blocksize is basically them saying: We where wrong the Bitcoin Cash developers where right. When that happens you will have two Bitcoins claiming to be Bitcoin and both of them working like Bitcoin. Will they coexist? Nobody knows. Will one die? Nobody knows. But at least both Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin will be usable and that is good for Bitcoin users. Now Bitcoin Core users that have small amounts of Bitcoin stuck can finally unstuck those.  Maybe a lot of users will not trust Bitcoin Core anymore and switch to Bitcoin Cash. It's just impossible to predict.  But it is very unlikely that after 4 years of being super stubborn about the block size limit suddenly Bitcoin Core would change it's mind. 
Yup. These are developers. They don’t know how to run projects. They know how to write code. That’s why we have project managers that interface with all parties in the ecosystem.

"> Yes, I've heard that argument, but is clearly false when discussing an 8 MB block-size limit.

But how is it clearly false? It's false because one group vs the other says so? That's what I get so frustrated about, this ""yes it will"", ""no it won't"" argument without either side bringing something to the table to back it up.

> and it would have absolutely no effect on centralisation of mining nodes, so that argument falls apart.

So you're saying that the increase of the block size limit did not, and will not impact the miners in any way whatsoever? No increase in bandwidth requirements, no increase in storage requirements, nothing? That would be the first I've heard of that zero-impact change.

"Bob has no direct connection to Carol. The only path to Carol from Bob in the example is Bob to me to shop to Carol.

Coin cannot leave a channel and hop to another channel. If Bob wants to pay Carol, Bob has to pay me after I agree to pay the coffee shop, who must also agree to pay Carol after I pay the shop. The coin that Carol gets is not actually the coin from Bob. Bob paid that to me.

Imagine channels like a metal rod with beads on it (like an abacus). Payment can happen by sliding some beads from one end to the other. Beads cannot be taken off one channel (rod) and placed onto the next."

"I strongly support blocksize increases, but financially speaking, BTC is likely going to continue to be dominant for some time.  If BCH gains dominance (and I hope it does), it will likely take significant adoption by retailers and lots of practical use to drive that.  This will take time.

I think the smart thing to do $$ wise is to hedge with both.  With the coins I held from before the fork, I did re-balance somewhat to favor BCH, but not to a great extent.  Especially with the uncertainty and EDA nonsense in the beginning, it seemed like a longshot to take off.  Things have stabilized, sure, but there remains significant risk.

And while we have seen some txn cost pain, it's not enough to dissuade large investors.  The price action outweighs whatever technical concerns they might have."

Surely, miners will always go along with the network, and won't go against their own interests... But I'd like to avoid the possibility of bad scenario for sure."

">Why do you think that? Segwit2x was rejected because it didn't have sufficient consensus. I don't ever see the blocksize changing without consensus even if the changes are merged into an active repo. 

Because there is only a single actively developed implementation on BTC and only a single person has commit access to it.  This is in direct contrast to BCH which as multiple active dev teams.  Segwit2x was called off because Jihan Wu who controls a majority of hash power decided to abandon it.  

I personally believe Jihan doesn't care about anything other than making money like any ration business man.  So he simply decided to continue to make money on BCH while also creating a huge fee market on BTC.  Lets get this clear if the Chinese miners really wanted to raise the block limit it would have happened ages ago as they control a majority of the has power.  However, if they came out and said this publicly the community would raise the block size even if the wasn't the chain with the most work.  So instead Jihan publicly calls for the block size to be raised by supporting BCH while keeping the 1MB block limit in place and reaping hundreds of millions in fees on BTC.

">I see both. That’s the whole problem. Half the people say it will increase centralization, the other half say it won’t. Neither have the data to back it up. 

It's impossible to prove a negative, prove to me there isn't an invisible tea pot orbiting the sun between earth and Mars. I need the information on why someone believes something to be true in order to disprove that evidence.

But most of the disproving would probably revolve around the fact that miners already need specialized hardware, so increasing block size would only add more storage to that hardware (and storage is by far the cheapest part). And it would require the person to understand that only miners count when we're talking about bitcoins decentralization.
"
"I don't agree with that. It's true it may be correlated, as more hash power would tend to mean more actors participating. However it is technically possible for a single actor to control all hash power (technically, I know it's a ridiculous thought) even if that hash power is the sum of all current hash power.

It is also possible that every person on the planet could be mining on a raspberry pi. This is arguably more decentralized, but the hash rate would be much lower."
"no this isn't really right

a block is a list of transactions, but bitcoin was made so these blocks would never be 'full'

the people who 'mine' the bitcoins and confirm the transactions are the ones that put the txs into blocks. So you can pay a fee on your tx, the idea is that the more you pay the more likely your transaction will be included in the block (blocks are found bout every 10 mins)

a few people took control of the code and changed how bitcoin works so that blocks would be full

previously transactions could be free and very close to it, without full blocks there is no reason to have high fees. The creator of bitcoin envisioned that in 30-40 years there would be enough people that all the small fees would may the miners

but since bitcoin was taken over the blocks have not grown like the creator of Bitcoin wanted, and so the fees are high. this is partly why people are leaving legacy bitcoin and moving to other things (like bitcoin cash for instance)"
Bitcoin Cash doesn't need a hard fork to increase the 8mb. It can increase all the way to 32mb without actually requiring a hard fork. 
"The plan has always been to always have more than enough capacity for whatever the demand is; there won't be a split, Bitcoin will upgrade as intended."
"I'll tell you. 

Blocks will continue to be full and fees will still rise. 

Unless Bitcoin core has lighting ready to go or raises the blocksize, Bitcoin Cash will continue picking up adoption where Bitcoin Core left off. "
What's the transaction ID? 
"I started to have flashbacks to this idiocrazy scene as I was trying to reason with people on a dutch forum. Damn blockstream was really affective with creating like 10 000 parots or something, all they ever do is just repeat stuff ..... 

 So yeah the gif wrote itself, only took me maybe 10 minutes or something to write down the text. /u/PedanticPendant did most of the work.  But I had no idea we would get so many upvotes. I knew it was good I just did not know it was THAT good. 

Also I just want to say that Electron Cash is working very very well for me and seeing those green notifications when money comes in is awesome. I know it was forked from Electrum (did you work on Electrum to?) but still thanks for all your work! "
Number 3.   Period. Sit back and watch. I keep saying this over and over. I’ll say it again. Developers don’t know how to create market-ready products. They know how to write code. They have little awareness of the ecosystem, and even less concern for end users. They create shit that nobody uses. That’s why developers don’t run projects. They’re told what to do by people with a more well-rounded understanding of the priorities. 
Yes, I've heard that argument, but is clearly false when discussing an 8 MB block-size limit.  You could easily still run full nodes in your home with an 8 MB cap.  Even a 16 MB or 32 MB or 64 MB cap would *not* preclude you from running a full node, and it would have absolutely no effect on centralisation of mining nodes, so that argument falls apart.  I still have yet to hear a single rational argument from anyone as to why a block size cap increase to 8 MB would lead to centralisation at all.  With a simple increase in the block-size cap the BTC user experience would improve dramatically, with far lower tx fees and faster confirmation times. 
"I don't think there is a negative to prove. In fact the way I see it is that BTC people really should have to prove that the amount of work or hardware specs caused by the dreaded 8MB block size would be outside the realm of possibility for everyday people.

Your argument is that it already requires specialized hardware, so what difference does extra storage make. This doesn't help the case that it would not lead to centralization.
"
"Tippr is a centralised service at the grace of whoever maintains it...

Bigger blocks can be done, but let’s first look into other scaling solutions. Big services are completely inefficient with their usage of the network. Give them bigger blocks and the will be full in no time. It’s like a little kid complaining about his small bedroom while leaving his stuff all over the place. 

The misinformation here: bitcoin core development is ruled by blockstream, blockstream is a puppet of Axa and banks. Blockstream pays people to spread fud. Moore’s Law will solve everything. Bitcoin Cash development is decentralised while most of the work is done by Deadalnix, who calls himself a benevolent dictator. The list goes on."
"My entire point is that no one individual or group can ""raise the blocksize"" and keep consensus. We are going in circles, you keep missing my point.

It's fine if you disagree. But please don't miss my point twice when doing so."
"[Not true](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7gbfuw/a_massive_collection_of_reasons_why_segregated/) the legacy codebase has been changed and is now much more complex which means it's harder to add new things and harder to get investors and new developers to understand it.

Bitcoin cash dones't have these complicated chagnes that makes future work more difficult"
"BCH largest node implementation has 82% market share.  BTC largest implementation is 88% with a majority of the other clients being old depreciated software that hasn’t been taken offline like 217 UASF nodes and BTC 1 noses.  The rest such as bitcoin unlimited, classic and xt developers now support Bitcoin Cash so its dishonest to say they are Bitcoin Core software.

You also completely ignored me calling out /r/bitcoin spreading FUD by lying about Microsoft not accepting bitcoin core as being unverified a day after the news had been verified. I would like to hear your thoughts on this."
Because that's how protocols work. 
"> but let’s first look into other scaling solutions

BTC and BCH camps disagree on the order. I'm siding with early Bitcoin, which continues in Bitcoin Cash: bigger blocks first, Counterparty-like L2 implementations second. If LN works, it'll work better on Bitcoin Cash chain

> will be full

Not when Bitcoin Cash upgrades to abjustible blocksize. Blocks will get as big as miners can handle and as big as there will be demand for

> The misinformation here

Call it when u see it. There's no ""official r/btc opinion"" just crowd wisdom which cnanges with the crowd. As crypto will become more and more popular, crowd will get dumber and dumber. Trust no one, do your research. No truthful sources by default"
"The negative here is that bigger blocks wouldn't cause centralization, I need to know why the person thinks 8mb is enough to cause centralization.

>Your argument is that it already requires specialized hardware, so what difference does extra storage make. This doesn't help the case that it would not lead to centralization.

Why do you think it doesn't help? A 1TB HD costs 50USD (and will last over two years of 8mb blocks), while a S9 miner costs 1350USD and probably will be obsolete in two years due to hash difficulty, 50 extra USD seem to make little difference. And realistically by the time BCH gets a 1TB blockchain 1TB Will be thumb drive capacity."
"Yeah. If you know how to code, check this out:

https://github.com/Bitcoin-ABC/bitcoin-abc/blob/master/src/validation.cpp

Look for blocksize()

If you don't know how to code, basically the block size can be adjusted without the need of a software upgrade. You just have to change it in the configuration file. "
They'll still have the toxic centralized dev team, and shit like RBF and the technical debt of the clunky segwit implementation.
"You may have been banned in r\/bitcoin for such suggestion.

r\/btc has no such moderation policy, you'll be fine here.

That said, SegWit adoption isn't going anywhere. Users that have old coins have to pay the fee no matter what - that ""incentive to switch"" *doesn't exist* because you only spend a coin once. Why create a whole new wallet and pay the full fee now, *and a SegWit fee later*, instead of just waiting to pay that full fee when you spend and skipping the extra wallet? It's another senseless waste of money - and, well, Bitcoin already has enough ways to do that. Merchant adoption will be great for ... those merchants, and nobody else. Coinbase isn't in a hurry to do it because *they* don't get a savings out of it either. With all the crowing and barking about fee reduction by SegWit, all that has actually happened is that fees have gone from 5 cents to 10 dollars. A 75% discount on a $10 fee does not sound better than a 5 cent fee."

Because the Bitcoin name is fractured. I want all of Bitcoin to be unified. It’s confusing as hell to new adopters. But at this point, unification is just a dream. I might not like BTC but an improvement to BTC is an improvement to Bitcoin as a whole. I’m not beholden to BCH. Don’t get me wrong—it’s great. But *if* Bitcoin Core wants positive changes, then I will stand behind those changes.

They want centralization. Hence the demonization of any non-core codebase. Varied codebases are the votes miners use to reach consensus. If everyone is using the same code then it's the person writing the code who makes the rules and you essentially have Ripple. That's the goal.

"This is why I moved to altcoins. People are coming up with lots of new original ideas that are much better without just being yet another hard fork of Bitcoin.

Look at RaiBlocks, for example. They can handle 7,000 transactions a second and everything is for free! I think people who are deep into all the first generation of coins, including all variations of bitcoins need to do some research on the new stuff that's out there and reconsider.

"I think this is the future; corporations and states will pay to operate nodes, even if the costs are fairly high, as a simple business cost.

It is not the romantic cyberpunk ideal, but I think it can work quite effectively.  I also think it is unlikely to cost so much that it's outside of the realm of the enthusiast to run a node.  Gigabit connections are becoming relatively common and quite affordable for many, and they can easily accommodate quite large blocks without affecting regular use.  Fiber is coming to my area in three months and I plan to operate a full node when that happens."
"My theory is, that they have married LN to Segwit and LN is the end goal, for whatever reasons.  If they do a true blocksize increase, it will kill Segwit adoption, faster then is already happening.

They lied and said LN needed Segwit. They lied and said Segwit was a blocksize increase.  They lied and said hardforks were bad.  Is it not possible that if they hardfork a blocksize increase, fix malleability in the ways LN needs, without Segwit, and make an LN that does not require the financial fuckery they created with Segwit, that the people with their heads way far, far up their asses, might actually wake up to the shit show that is Bitcoin Core? 

I am not optimistic at this point, but I would think they would be starting to get concerned that they cannot keep pulling the wool over people's eyes.  So in their fear, they choose to stay the path and hope they can pull the final boondoggle before the sheep wake up."
[deleted]
You could achieve the exact same thing with a block size increase though. What solution does LN and segwit offer that raising the block size doesnt? What are the cons of raising the block size limit that LN and segwit doesnt have? Im failing to see the dangers to the technology high enough to warrant needing off chain solutions in the first place. 
if your takeaway from the last 7 years is that bitcoin cash deserves your money, good luck bud. 
"I am explaining a scenario when a lightning network channel fails.

Lightning Network won't always work. It is quite possible for a payment to fail when a user expects it to succeed. For instance, if I go offline, Bob no longer has a connection to Carol since there is a break in the network. In order for a payment to be able to flow, all hops must be online at that moment, and all channels along those hops must have sufficient funds in an arrangement which will allow said payment."
"That’s missing my point. I’m saying that this ‘what if’ is nearly theoretical. At least for the next few months.

"If Bob closes his channel with me in a malicious manner (trying to claim he hasn't spent his funds in the channel when he has), I can broadcast a competing (valid) claim and take all of the value from that channel.

Bob can only try to double spend, but he risks losing all funding of the channel due to time lock verify protection.

At least, that's my current understanding of the incentive structure.

When you said that is not how it works, can you clarify which part you think I have wrong? Thanks."
