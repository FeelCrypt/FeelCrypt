"Which version of Bitcoin are you referring to?

You aren't calling the version that actually works a ""shitcoin"" are you?"
Ofc, Segwit is useless
"BCH forked off of BTC a while back, basically over a disagreement in how to scale the network. Now there's two separate networks running with slightly different rulesets.

Due to some historical political struggles both sides strongly dislike each other (for the most part) and the mudslinging basically never stops.

As someone who has held since 2011, all I can do is watch from the sidelines and smile. :-).
Ha! Just this minute got the official gdax email! I’m hoping that eventually they will allow trading pairs between the other traded coins on the exchange. I’d love to drop some of my LTC for some of that sweet, sweet BCH.

"Bitcoin Cash: ""Say my name."""
Bitcoin (Cash) is sound money. It's both a currency and a store of value. What we do is save in it, but also spend + rebuy.
Great, easy to understand explanation, thanks! 
Ha ha. If you weren't so horribly worried right now you wouldn't be brigading this sub.
"Not for long....📈 😋🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑

BTC: 📉"
At least 3800 is kimda close to reality
Seems plausible, since market cap is one of the factors they seem to be considering in evaluating new additions, and Ripple is the next biggest coin by market cap which is not yet tradeable on Coinbase
LiteBcore? No thanks.
Nah litecoin better 
What's a honey badger referring to?
Bitcoin awaken 4 months ago. **IT'S TIME TO EAT**
Forking is not the same as “creating [his] own version of BTC”. They were one and the same until the fork and now the blockchain has split and in time the network will determine which prong is “the real bitcoin”. This silly narrative that BCH is a rip-off of BTC is just completely false and needs to die. 
Lucky you. I got in after the hard fork. 
It really is beautiful... it is a pure free market working out the best solution. I think that's probably why Coinbase did this in the first place. May the best coin win. 
Seriously 😆 - diversifying is super important for this reason. You win either way.
So much less stressful this way.
Good on you!  I was a prefork holder and at 10:1 couldnt resist moving a bit over to bch.   Got 75% of my original btc and 300% of my original bch.   
I decided to begrudgingly do the same 3 nights ago. Very glad I did. I'm sick of both communities but I'll profit from them all the same.
"Yeah, getting in before the fork was a godsend. I have no idea what to advise my friends to buy between BTC and BCH because I have no incentive to research which is a better investment in the current bull/bear market (like, which is it even about to turn into?); in the long run, I'm automatically hedging my bets, so I'm just gonna let it stay put."
Does this mean if someone's owned Bitcoin for a while, they own both Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash?
"same

While the linked OP is bait, commenters over there do have a point about launching BCH support unannounced and after business hours stinking to high heaven. It's insider trading and market manipulation like this which gets SEC and other govt agencies all regulation-happy, and that's not good for anyone.
"Did you even follow what happened?

It was some of the worst amateur shit I have ever seen... They opened trade without first building a backlog/liquidity. It looks like they have no idea about markets...

Then happened what had to happen: market price sell orders for tens of thousands of bch, the price would have dropped to below 100$ in seconds, they had to press the emergency break. It would be funny, but sadly that is how competent they are. Any third world stock exchange is more skilled than that."
Is this satire? (sorry hard to tell these days).
I can't believe how clueless that sub is.

I'll piggyback on OP's question if you don't mind : does this mean we might see in the short run a massive sell of bitcoin (and so a decrease in value)?
Also a novice question: So I've bought some BTC on coinbase in the summer, sold some for a good profit and still hold some. Now BTH pops up and my account balance goes even more bananas than it usually does. Did I just get free cryptocurrency or are BTC and BTH somehow interlinked? Do I buy/sell one when I buy/sell the ohter?
The talk of changing the white paper is on the Bitcoin.org Github not on the Bitcoin Core repo.  
"> Bitcoin cash does not have segwit

This tells you all you need to know about BCH."
It's a total mess and there are years of history to catch up on, but this is a very good summation of the important recent points. Nice work.
Actually, IOTA is the Cryptocurrency for the future. The buying price is super low for now. So if you're hesitant, better buy iota... You'll thank me
">  Both /r/btc and /r/bitcoin are severely biased

That's putting it diplomatically"
Are there any resources that simulate market behavior of cryptocurrencies?
By that logic every altcoin is the real way to go... 
Yeah there's a fuck up somewhere. Everyone on coinbase were seeing 3k while gdax was going up to 9.5k.

I'm getting better. Plus it's small sums.

Thank you. That was simple. Appreciate it.
The real bloodbath will start when GDAX  enables BTC/BCH trading.  With the feelings of BCH holders vs BTC holders, those trades are only gonna go one way: Sell.
Long game. BCH $5000 by New Years Eve as soon as coinbase is operational. 
I don’t. When will the temporary disablement be fixed? I’m watching it rise and I can’t buy and I won’t let them funnel me into creating a Gdax account.

Check out that comment history. Something doesn't sit right.

It did go that high, tx did occur on gdax. They are using some other market info to fill in the gaps when gdax is offline.
"LOL OK https://imgur.com/a/Pf42l

He did, he talking about BCH
HAHAHA please tell me why is bcash better than bitcoin?
Thanks for the suggestion but it also uses usdt so its not an improvement over bittrex i think
Really no idea, but I'd love to know if the ~$3,100 is even correct lol
Every outside site I have checked shows it in the low to mid 3k's right now, so I don't really believe it is anywhere near 8500-9000. Plus, CoinGecko just showed BTC rebound to over 17k. I don't think it'd be going up if BCH just jumped to 9k.
 No. Unfortunately the brainwashing at /r/bitcoin can't last forever.

"“Bitcoin” brand is going to take the hit long term, that means Cash and Core. Markets thrive in competition, but fraud and manipulation is something else entirely. 
It’s like how in a divorce both parents fight and it’s the kids who really get damaged. This is the big bad news story that mainstream media was waiting for. Sure they don’t fully understand what has occurred since it’s only 12 hours later, but these price drops will bring the investigative reporting and the entire brand will take a significant price hit. 
Look I’m not a supporter of Core or Cash, I’m just a supporter of the entire crypto movement. 
The damage done last night will be felt immediately and undo the gains from the last 2 months. 
At least we can say we were all there and saw the end of the great 2017 crypto bubble. "
"Dawg there are over 11k sell orders stuck right now. You're about to get dumped on. 

Let me make that clear. 3k volume brought it 9k, and now 11k volume is being dumped. Do the math."

guess ya didn't see the 11k volume of sell orders before they took it off the screen.

"Many thanks. should I wait for BTC to drop to £11000 GBP or less before investing a small amount of money? 
Also with BCH should I wait for it to go down again or buy now as it's gone up nearly £1000 in the past day/week. "
"I really hope so, but I seriously doubt it. It sounds like all open book orders were cancelled and no new orders will be excepted. It was basically the announcement for ""We're freezing the price at $8500 until we can figure out wtf is going on."" I don't think anything fucked up. I'll quote some dude above:

Yes
"yes. Just youtube your wallet and ""how do I get my BCH from..."" and you can find videos describing it. Just make sure you watch a few of them and research the wallets they are recommending for BCH. I want to do it, but I am concerned about moving my BTC from one wallet to another with the high fees, so I am waiting. That and I am not 100% sure what i am doing (but that is kind of exciting b/c I am learning!)"

No, trading is halted till 9am on the west coast
Why don't you just buy both?
Try bitstamp instead. Same services if not better (at times).
Use Gemini 
"I use Gemini and manage my gfs coinbase. All I can say is Gemini is so far superior it's not even funny. Coinbase has the most redicuous deposit fees, trading fees, and ""crashes""( aka clear manipulation).

To answer your diversify question I would just open a bittrex account, send etherium there, sell it, then buy altcoin. That site has the best user interface, altcoin selection and legitimacy."

"The bitcoin network reached maximum capacity recently. It wasn't unexpected - for the better part of the last two years or so, everyone in the bitcoin community basically knew that we were approaching max capacity rapidly, and the community was divided about how to solve the problem. One part of the community wanted to increase the size of the ""blocks"" of transactions, which would increase the capacity of the network at the cost of requiring a bit more disk space on the network ""nodes"". The other part of the community favored inventing a seond ""layer"" of the bitcoin blockchain which would handle most transactions, freeing up capacity on the main chain at the expense of some added complexity and need for brokers to tie up capital in payment channels with the new layer.

The argument got contentious, and though attempts at compromise were made by major players from both sides of the debate, in the end no compromise was really reached. The part of the community that favored the ""big blocks"" approach split off and became Bitcoin Cash, keeping the same history of transactions as the main bitcoin blockchain from before the split but having its own distinct transaction history for dates after the split. The part of the community favoring a second layer for main transactions with the main layer for settlement stayed as Bitcoin.

Coinbase, the largest US cryptocurrency exchange, is now making Bitcoin Cash available for purchase and sale for the first time. In the space of time between the split and now, it's been kind of a hassle to buy/sell the new Bitcoin Cash tokens. Many people who had Bitcoin held by Coinbase are now getting access to their Bitcoin Cash for the first time, so there's likely to be interest in selling those tokens from people who don't believe in the big blocks solution, interest in buying those tokens from people that do, and investor interest in reading the momentum and jumping in when they think the price is favorable."
"bitcoin is a digital currency that allows you to quickly send money anywhere in the world for a low fee.

Well, that's what it was intended to be... bitcoin (BTC) doesn't actually accomplish this anymore, as it can cost $20-$50 to send very small amounts of money and can take hours or days, because the network can't handle all the transactions people are sending and is constantly stuck with a huge backlog.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is basically a newer version, split away from the original bitcoin, that does what bitcoin was intended to do. It has an improved ability to handle large #s of transactions, and thus you can send your money for a low fee and get it quickly on the other end.

So Coinbase, the main app where people buy and sell crypto, just added bitcoin cash, which is huge because it greatly increases exposure of the cryptocurrency to the general public and makes it much easier to buy. So the general expectation is that the price of BCH will rise greatly in the coming weeks and months (outside of people invested in the original bitcoin who are here to try to downplay these facts to protect their investments)."
Bcash got added to an exchange and some insider trading happens before it,  price in on 9,5k but no buyers,  and no sell or buy option.  It's gonna tank
Coinbase is a pretty simple platform for US customers to buy and sell coins on, yes. You have to get verified to make large transactions (>$400 I think), but if you just want to dabble getting up and running is simple.
I'd say there's probably more potential for a relief rally of some size, but ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
It will go down eventually. Just buy and hodl. Review your stack once a year and you won't get nervous.
They're following the price of other exchanges for a ticker for now
"I've heard a ton of rumors of bittrex losing your money. I've had no issues yet, but I'm gonna be moving everything off of it to binance soon.

I send my bitcoin funds from binance to **bitcoin cash** on coinbase but the funds no show up. I lost my money?"
This guy gets it.  
🤔 I wonder if there will ever be a huge coordinated sell of someday. Or a “crypto run” on a specific coin. 
Is this true? I would love to get in at 3100, but at this point it looks like its gonna come back open at 8500-9500 like gdax is saying.
Thanks. What explains the bizarre jump to $8500? Is that just a glitch?

"My guess is they're stupid. No supply, bots drive up price it gets out of hand fast. Basically a small imbalance on the buy sell scale moves price huge due to low volume and low liquidity. And coinbase might sell limit orders orders on their own exchange causing even more problems as people on coinbase sell and buy using suppsodily fixed prices with no liquidity behind it.


This is just my guess. No idea if I'm right or not "

Hell yeah. As soon as I saw the post that the BCH API was added to Coinbase, I bought another 4 BCH below $2k. It was my last chance to get in
If you look at the price on other exchanges, that price is not correct. When trading resumes it will be lower.
yes

"the whole crypto market cap pulled back about 40-50 billion at one time, looks like its climbing back up ( the whole cap)

It grants buying/selling access to a MUCH bigger population than BCH had before. Coinbase is the biggest American exchange.

don't be jealous that you picked the cripplecoin
Buying an S9?
Insider trading.  Goes without saying that shapeshift would run out of BCH right before this dropped. 
I wouldn't be surprised if BCH goes to 10k really fast, there is enough indication that it has been massively bought for a long time now. Not even the mega dumps of gray scale fund, xapo and bitmex did much to hurt the price.

Basically every exchange is garbage. Coinbase is one of the better ones if you don't want to trade many different cryptos, though they always screw up every new coin launch. If you want a very similar platform you could try gemini. I personally use Bittrex.
use GDAX. It is owned by coinbase. If you have a validated coinbase account you have a GDAX account

How do you know they ran out? How can you tell? I put an order through for a small dollar figure since I'd never used shapeshift before but it came through just fine. I made another transaction for about $500 about 20 minutes ago and it looks like it cleared but it's not in my coinbase wallet yet
Good job on keeping it neutral! I appreciate that as i'm tired of the holy wars between BTC & BCH.. The war-mongering only hurts both BTC & BCH. 
Me too, boss. Just mining and auto converting to BCH as fast as possible lmao.
It's a yo dawg ban
because bch is a superior product
Thanks :)
Wrong. Didn’t work. App’s a joke

People sell 11000 coins, your shitcoins gone. "
It's going to be late 2018 if at all this year.. and the s9's are still very profitable
I've had the API setup for a while and don't see this. Curious where you see reference to BCH in the docs or on the generate keys page, even the currencies section still doesn't list it https://docs.gdax.com/#get-currencies
Thank you, I appreciate it.
Is it for price monitoring?
Add on to that the fact that congressman and senators can do all the insider trading they want and it is perfectly legal.
It's very arguable that insider trading HELPS the markets correct more quickly to known issues, even if it helps a few fat cats it also helps the average investor.  
"Actually they do, weirdly enough.

My best friend works there and I was asking him for advice generally for Cryptocurrency investing and said nothing. 

Obviously can't speak for everyone but we talked about blockchain for hours in the past couple of days and nothing was said. "
True.  But it isn't like it hasn't been public knowledge that this was coming for the last several months.  The only unknowns until recently were whether buying was going to be an option as well, and what it would be worth by this time.
"Well if they did it didn't leak to the major players, or we would have seen more of a blunted run-up to the announcement. Instead there is still noticeable ""pop"" and the run-up mirrors the general run-up of crypto valuation."
I never really understood the debt thing. I've filed for bankruptcy, it sucked, but I wouldn't have sold state secrets or done anything illegal to avoid it though. Just suck it up and deal with it, learn your lesson, and move on.
"You are right there is no way to prevent it.  But Coinbase is large, and has Wall Street investors (Bloomberg L.P. for one).  The SEC may treat such activity as ""insider trading"", for which there are severe penalties.  So to protect themselves as a company and their employees as individuals, they needed a rule against it.  

If an employee then goes ahead and trades based on ""material non-public information"" (the legal term used), it is on their own head, not the company."
"Only people making real money off Bitcoins are the founders of Bitcoins themselves.

Nice pyramid scheme going on. Buy more bitcoins and we'll both be rich!"
'They'. Many exchanges/brokers don't.
"That super sucks.  Even though I haven't experienced the same issue as you, I'm still skeptical (""cautiously optimistic""?) with non-US based exchanges.

Binance is one of the only places I can register to get some of the newer cryptos I'm interested in (ie: IOTA).  Granted, currently IOTA withdrawals are suspended ATM.

Additionally, they update and integrate forks really fast.

I have only a few dollars of BTC and ETH sitting there, but I already have matched forks available in my wallet (BCX/ETF/SBTC/etc) which I wasn't really even aware of until I saw new balances that were available."
No dude, for the market price of the thing you're buying. Why the fuck would you buy at 7.2?
I'm a Bitcoin shill, so I will leave you with this. When you get in the game of a coin made by millionaire's, don't expect fairness and kindness to be given to you. Back to /r/Bitcoin I goooooo

Agreed! I don't like contracts that are too smart for their own good...
"The alts may be burning a bit, but that was after an insane bull run this week, so a little pullback was bound to happen anyway. It’s like, hey, if it’s 200% increase instead of 300%, how can we complain? 

The fact that this is tied to the BCH Coinbase news makes it easier to digest too, cus it’s likely everyone pulling a bit out of their stacks and going into BCH to ride the wave. That’s great, cus they likely will go back into their alts again after their BCH gains.

So it’s a win no matter what 👍🏼"
I'm pretty sure there's a large concoction of 14 year olds on that sub too. 
Thank you for your insight, much appreciated. Diversification seems to be key, as with any other kind of investment I suppose :)
Thanks a lot for your input, much appreciated.
So you admit the only reason for Bitcoin Cash's current market value is that it piggybacks on Bitcoin's branding and valuation? 
Good one!  Maybe a little old?  I was thinking Zach Galifiankis from hangover.

"That's nice and all but my main issue as to why I never put any money in before was that the Ripple dev team hold 60% of all the coins as it was premined, it feels like XRP and many other alts have only risen in line with the rise on Bitcoin. I was wondering if there was more I missed. I have noticed many of the people IRL ive spoken to about crypto who dont hold any seem to be attracted to Ripple. One of them told me they invested into some Ripple but had done it through eTorro and said they couldnt trade them at that moment because ""The markets had closed"" which seemed silly to me as crypto markets never close. "

"No, it's certainly possible and Coinbase didn't have to take any hit.

Imagine if the order book looks like this:

* Person A is selling 1 BCH for $3500

* Person B is selling 1 BCH for $6000

* Person C is selling 1 BCH for $9500

New Buyer D checks Coinbase and sees the price listed at $3500.  He decides to buy $10,000 USD worth of BCH, expecting to receive 2.86 BCH.  Instead, the order book gets swallowed up due to lack of depth and he receives 2.05 BCH.

Coinbase doesn't take any hit, it's just a big disappointment for the buyer, and that's a reason that market buy orders can be really hazardous in low volume markets.  They may have (I am speculating, here) wanted some time to get an order book built and padded with more volume to prevent this poor service."
D'oh!
Yeah it’s so hard to predict - things change on the fly in this market all the time. And that’s why smart people diversify!
there'll still be BTC on exchanges that people can trade with, and someone will be stupid enough to buy it even when the network itself is basically dead. Case in point: bitcoin gold/diamond
you're gonna thank me in about 20 minutes :]

"The entire reason for implementing SegWit on BTC is that it is a necessary layer for adding Lightning Networks after.  Lightning Networks have been in development since 2015 and might be able to bring instantaneous & near-free transactions to BTC.   The fork only happened because over 95% of miners supported it. 

I’m bullish on BCH and have diversified to hold both.  But I’d recommend you keep your skin in the BTC game too, until we see how the Lightning Networks play out.  I think the first bitcoin-powered credit card will be operating on BTC.  

I also believe BCH has big potential to poach a lot of the best developers, and might be implementing SegWit2x of its own.  We might still see both coins climb. "
"That's an answer noone can answer honestly since that would just be speculation.

However the actual value (rather than the price) used to be dictated by that bitcoin was a fast and cheap way to do international transactions and that is simply not the case with bitcoin anymore, it seems like people just blindly invest in it currently. So as you might guess, my theory is that the bitcoin price will drop once people stop blindly invest in it and you cannot know when that will happen. I personally have a lot more faith in other cryptocurrencies than bitcoin (ethereum, litecoin, bitcoin cash, rai blocks), but you shouldn't blindly follow the opinions of a stranger on the internet. It's practically betting but with a higher chance at winning currently, so please diversify your crypto investments! "
Possibly. I don't predict anything short term, I know that I would only be guessing.
You essentially have 2 separate coins now.
They are separate now, but are forked from the same original blockchain. Since August 1st they've been separate.
Sorry, assumed they were the same in my head. But you're right, they are technically separate
Depends what you mean, but I'm guessing no
"Did you even follow what happened?

It was some of the worst amateur shit I have ever seen... They opened trade without first building a backlog/liquidity. It looks like they have no idea about markets...

Then happened what had to happen: market price sell orders for tens of thousands of bch, the price would have dropped to below 100$ in seconds, they had to press the emergency break. It would be funny, but sadly that is how competent they are. Any third world stock exchange is more skilled than that.

So I transfered the litecoin on to Bittrex instead, because those dust levels are ridiculous and completely unnecessary."
Me too! Too bad I had no funds to buy more, but it was a good move.
"In your Coinbase user settings, find the panel for API access.  Click on add a new key, and walk through it, see what options are there.   There were some checkbox fields added within the last couple days to query BCH stats.

There was a post yesterday that bch was added as an option in the gdax api. 
"this post alerted me to it: https://redd.it/7kfzbi

but I have tinkered with the API before, to link with my mint.com account, if that's what you're asking."
"I intend to hold both coins for the interim.  I think they will both continue to rise in tandem. 

BTC has lightning networks on the horizon.   That was the reason for the fork in the first place, to add SegWit, to lay the framework. 

BCH has rumors of SegWit2x if its own.  And currently has minimal tx fees. 

I’m kind of bullish on both.  And XMR + NMC, for what it’s worth. "

"Pretty much.

My brother has a job in IT security and part of that contract states he's not allowed to gamble or go to casinos because they worry if he goes into debt he'll sell security secrets and stuff.

It's all bullshit, there's zero way they can enforce it and he can always ask someone else to buy him a lottery ticket and they could never find out.

Make no mistake, there's no fucking way employees of Coinbase are going to keep stuff like this secret when their partner, friends or families could literally be making MILLIONS.

No chance."
"Welcome to the new world of Bitcoin.    New technology makes the rules unenforceable and obsolete.  Tis what it is.. 

But it was no secret.  They had announced it would happen in short order, and all of the other major players were making their moves.   Unless you had your head buried in /r/bitcoin, where every piece of good BCH new is censored,  it was a surprize to nobody..


"
Considering they require photo ids and all that crap that makes crypto worthless...
"Oh, no doubt. I'm holding. But getting some sub-$4k is not a bad thing at all! Buy now!

Edit: And now it's already disabled again!"
"Both are evolutions of the original vision of Bitcoin which was intended to be digital cash owned by everyone rather than a community or a country. 

Since then Bitcoin has become more like digital gold - solid, reliable, cumbersome to use - and therefore needs a ""practical"" digital silver to go with it (via Litecoin or the Lightning Network they are developing) so you can buy your coffee at starbucks with it.

Problem is that Bitcoin was originally meant to be a stand alone system. 

Bitcoin Cash can do that and works as cash rather than just a store of value. Therefore some people see Bitcoin Cash as the ""real"" Bitcoin since it is closer to the original vision.

Problem is that Bitcoin Cash's solution that enables it to be used as Cash (ie bigger data blocksizes) is only temporary since it will end up in the same predicament and Bitcoin when it gets big enough.

They are competing visions of the same original philosophy.

The good thing is that everyone who had a Bitcoin was given a Bitcoin Cash coin too so whichever one won the ""battle"" wouldnt have mattered if you held onto both coins. 

But people have gambled that one side or the other will win so have sold one half of their coins - hence there is a lot of animosity between the groups."
Haha, we just wait and hope BCH pumps!
I don’t know, but someone on here definitely does. Ask in a few spots on this sub and you’ll get the right answer. The short answer is yes you have both coins and will be able to get your BCH out :)

"I don't understand this mentality. LTC has an extremely low transaction cost and quick confirmations and can be exchanged for other alts. 

no need to be 100% in one coin. "
Pretty sure it's going right so into your usd at what it was before the order. We'll see... 
No other markets saw it go up like that other than coinbase and gdax. Not sure... 
"IMO All of the points in your posts are spot on.

I especially agree with the sentiment in your first sentence of the post I'm replying to. It's called DYOR, and many people on these bitcoin subreddits seem to be either unwilling or incapable of any information-gathering methods other than having info spoon fed to them.

Also the BCH shilling that goes around like mad is really rather incredible and it's clear the person(s) or group(s) that organized the constant and perpetual shilling have deep pockets. When you see someone who has written any of the crazy cultish shit like 'Bitcoin Cash is what Satoshi originally envisioned,' or, 'Bitcoin Cash is what Bitcoin is supposed to be,' or, well, I could keep on going forever, but just like you, I don't care to invest more time than I intended to chit chatting on Reddit."
Thank you so very much for your analysis, i appreciate it greatly.  
Thats the GDAX price
That's what I'm on. It's just spitting out errors and that same message. Been trying for an hour now.
lol the drama
So once coinbase and gdax hour are back live bcash is crashing? 
The fucked up part is that its only crashing because they froze the fucking market. Otherwise it would have kept gaining with the absurd buy orders that were open previously. How is this not textbook market manipulation?
To what end? To verify whether any given exchange is about to participate in market manipulation by arbitrarily freeze the buying and selling of coins? Yeah, for sure. I'll check with my mother too.
Again, please show me how we are about to lose most of our holdings?
Tone Vays gets everything backwards. He's making a career out of it.
Too many people go ahead and post in r/btc without checking whether somebody else has already posted the same link or topic. I appreciate that you checked for dupes first. That's one less repetitive post for everyone to slog through, so thank you.
Click on BCH from the app dash and click at the most recent point on the graph. It shows ~$3,100 for me.
Oh shit. It was so obvious. Sorry guy i failed you. I should be ashamed.
"Thanks! I'm not heavily invested in either, just a bit of ""fun money"" since it's an interesting asset class, but I expect to maintain current holdings.

Exchange rates fluctuate wildly - that's sort of always been true in crypto but lately volatility is off the charts. In the last 3 weeks alone, bitcoin has varied between a low of $9,664 per BTC to a high of $19,687 per BTC. Over the same period, Bitcoin cash has varied from a low of $1342 per BCH to a high of $3943 per BCH."
In my personal opinion bitcoin (BTC) will continue to go up in the short-medium term, but bitcoin cash will go up more in the very short term and will also be a better long-term investment, as bitcoin cash does what bitcoin was designed to do, better.
Actually, nobody knows. Probably we will see a huge BCH price increase in the next hours due to BCH being added to Coinbase and GDAX, but it could also drop due to the same fact...
I hope you're right.
Well, enjoy your ban for ban evasion.
Why not bch? BTC has the bigger name
"1) Bittrex is not a broker it's a trading platform (just like metatrader). 

2) Make an account and get verified. You can not withdraw without being verified. 

3) Etherium will transfer within minutes for lower fees where btc can take hours.  
"
"One works a bit better.

Neither are the future.

i'm not gona ""shill"" any specific coin but do your research there are better options than both bitcoins"
The bitcoin network was split into 2 different currencies on August 1st because of a disagreement on how to scale and what the transaction fees should be. Everyone who held bitcoin before august 1st has equal amounts of BTC and BCH.
It would make sense. I mean that means more supply in the market. And the people that received free BCH aren’t looking to buy more BCH... sooo very weird
What is bitcoin cash? Is it different? 
Yeah but it takes weeks to get money into coinbase
Think I’m gonna get an investment into BCH now aswell! To the moon
/u/tippr for president!
"mfw when I suddenly got a bunch of BCH because I was holding BTC at the time of the fork

Well let's test how well tippr works"
In theory.... 
Coinbase, where is my money, it straight up disappeared ok your platform! 10k!
"Can I use Coinbase in Germany?

It says it is not supported. But I have heard of people having used it in the past"
Care to explain for someone from r/all?
According to Bloomberg coin base will start trading again at 9am Pacific time
I'm a cryptocoin newb. Is buying and selling going to be pretty straightforward?
Guys please tell me BTC will go down again when bcash resumes coinbase trading. 
With crypto ... should I buy at a low price or a high price? When I see a high price, I think I should buy as it's going up... but then when it drops, I realise I get more for less but then I'm scared if it crashes ...
If GDAX and Coinbase trading of Bitcoin Cash is disabled, why is the price still going up and down in their app? In the last hour, as at 10:55 am EST it says its up $20.87 CAD...
"Anybody scared what is going to happen once GDAX enables BCC trading? 
Thinking of transferring it to Bittrex .
"
The sales have resumed, at least at GDAX. They went live at 11am pst
I send my bitcoin funds from binance to bitcoin cash on coinbase but the funds no show up. I lost my money?
So it was trading last night at 9,500 it crashed and is at 3,700 how is it in the green? And why is there no evidence of this on the graphs. Think they should halt all trading on Bitcoin cash until this huge hiccup is taken care of. People need to research before they buy.
Well that is a big news for Bitcoin Cash but I mean who didn't see this coming?

"Bitcoin Cash is the the most authentic version of Bitcoin to what Satoshi envisioned in 2008. 

I will never forget the negligence that Bitcoin Core's developers forced onto this community in their process of making Bitcoin unusable."
Congrats to everyone who made some good money just now. It’s always good to see people make money. Especially the underdogs. Hats off to BCH
ATTN: If you go into the CoinBase app, select BCH, and click on the end of the graph (current time). The correct current price will show, which happens to be $3,108.01 at the time of this post (6:45PM AZ).
Damn, Ver was right. I think in his AMA yesterday, when asked if Coinbase will support it in 2018, he said they will support it in 2017.
Hello balance my old friend.
I'm from popular. What does this mean to us?
Thanks for all of you guys who worked so hard for BCH, devs, businesses, community 🚀
For somebody who knows nothing about cryptocurrency, what is the difference between bitcoin and bitcoin cash?
I dont understand wtf is going on? Can someone explain? What is Bitcoin Cash & How does it compare to regular Bitcoin?
Coinbase is not a safe option for people who want to remain anonymous. imo

Bitcoin Cash at $9500 on gdax??? Is this truly the price or some sort of glitch??
"So I bought my bitcoin on July 29. The transaction time took a few days, I received it in my account on Aug 4. 

Anyone know if I'll receive BTC cash since I purchased it before August 1? Or am I shit outta luck? It's not showing up in my account. "
Well shut me up!

[Merry Christmas!](https://youtu.be/eBa2Mm-nP50?t=14s)
Everyone that was holding bitcoin on coinbase during the fork just got access to their bch.  More coins will now hit the market. I would think bch price will fall from this, but I guess we will see. 
[for those of you who have no idea what this is](https://support.coinbase.com/customer/portal/articles/2911542-bitcoin-cash-faq)
Looks bullish to me.
"I would love to but I can't fucking get my identity verified no matter how many perfect pictures I take of my US drivers license and their support is worthless. ""Please try again, sorry you're having trouble""."

prepare for pump & dump bch xdd
"Are they gonna let people buy this shit or what? This is a joke. The price of BCH continues to rise, meanwhile nobody can purchase on coinbase.

What a fucked up scenario."
Remember in November when this same thing happened?  Its going to happen again when everyone dumps there bcash and you guys are holding bags.
I'm so happy.

Yea, only I can't fucking buy any on GDAX. Fuck Coinbase. They're so god damn late to the game.

GDAX not taking any orders at all
As a casual, what does this mean? Should I leave btc for bch?
So I’ve had a crypto wallet for some time with btc from a small purchase growing to about $30 so that was cool to watch. If I can now buy and sell bch easily should I just buy a small amount of bch to turn quickly in the next few weeks. I have very little knowledge on crypto currency but any info would be appreciated. 
Freaking damn, wanted to buy BCH since 300 still waiting for verifications.. 
"Ah, glad my coinbase account is acting up and I can’t get any support because... well because it is coinbase

Does anyone have a good way to get my money out of coinbase to another wallet?"
I get off the internet for a few measly hours and this happens?! Can't step away for one second without missing out, I swear
"Still waiting to actually be able to buy bch.

I'll eventually figure out how to wrest my 0.029 I had back in August from my wallet (not at coinbase), but for now there's no need."
So for every one of these forks, if it occurred at a time you own BTC, you have an equal amount of that new coin? 
I sent some BCH form coinbase app to my hw wallet address and it's still pending, did I lose it?
Holy shit I'm not a supporter of BTC or BCH but this will hit hard.
Yesterday I swapped good portion of my BTC for BCH. Enough to be holding more BCH then any other crypto. Perfect timing!

I know you don't take sides and I know this was probably mostly if not entirely a business decision. But I still wanted to thank you for enabling buying and trading of Bitcoin Cash, and for doing it way earlier than most people even speculated. That is awesome! I look forward to telling people they no longer have to transfer their slow and expensive BTC from Coinbase to buy BCH. Now I will just tell them to buy it directly on coinbase! Ignore the onslaught of trolling you will get for this. They are a vocal minority. The fact is, bitcoin is unusable. It is a clown-show and everyday it becomes more and more obvious. Bitcoin Cash was the obvious next coin to add for a number of reasons. Thank you!"

I'm so happy about this! We finally did it! Despite all the bashing on BCH in my country's main crypto Telegram chat, I ignored the noise and held on to what I believe in. Here we go! Bitcoin Cash! 
Going to be sick with this much movement. Holy smokes.
I bought on gdax during the 3 minutes it was up. It says that I bought at 5250, but apparently it never even hit that high, as it's showing 3100 on other sites atm. Will it correct? 
"Uh, I don't have any BCH in my Coinbase account. It says you had to have BitCoin on August 1, 2017. I don't know if I did--I possibly sold my balance by that date. But I had BTC before and after that date.

You had to have it explicitly on that date? I haven't kept up with any of this so I don't know. I thought the BTC blockchain was copied, but I guess that means it was only copied at one instance, and isn't a running copy? "
Only buy, send, and receive if you’re in Canada.
Why didn't they announce this in advance? Like in the [roadmap](https://mobile.twitter.com/Andrea_Dispe/status/943330470552485888) they released just a few days ago?

It's gotta come down....right???"
"All BCH books will enter cancel-only mode, and all existing orders will be cleared. While in cancel-only mode, no new orders will be accepted. We will post an update shortly.

Is the dump already starting? Huge selloffs on everywhere but bithumb
It’s currently $0.00, NOW IS THE TIME TO BUY!
These comments are proof that some people who like bch are just doing it for the money lol
LOL I was just finishing a trade on GDAX from BTC to ETH so I can then buy Bitcoin Cash on another exchange, and when I go back to Coinbase to check my balances this announcement hits me out of the blue... well, back to GDAX again

Yeah that $8,500 is a typo.  It's supposed to be $85,000.
Uh, where?
Saw that on Coinbase too.  Also took a picture of it.  Could not buy and sell, so there was no way to sell at the premium before they opened it up for trading.

Not for me 
Coinbase is the biggest crypto exchange in the world and is so popular + easy to use that people who have no idea what crypto is can use it. IE when MSNBC Money covers a coin, this is where your 50 year old dad that can't use Facebook buys coins. These people are seeing how useless Bitcoin is as a currency and will want to try something different. Bitcoin Cash sounds very similar and people are betting casuals will go to something familiar that actually works.

"1. Coinbase(GDAX) is one of the larger exchanges and user friendly. This is important as there are lots of new users incoming at the moment. Similar to say a large supermarket now stocking a new brand, more people see it as an option.

2. When the fork first happened, anybody holding Bitcoin was credited an equal amount of Bitcoin Cash. Coinbase did not allow users access to their Bitcoin Cash but are now doing so. 

There may be other points but they're less quantifiable. For example, /r/bitcoin criticism the legitimacy of Bitcoin Cash this can be seen as proving BCH's legitimacy. (Personally this is a non-issue).

As always try an verify what I've said independently. "
Bitcoin’s has scaling difficulties and transaction fees are rising so high it has become unusable ($30 per transaction). To solve this the blocksize limit needs to be increased so more transactions can be processed in each block. Bitcoin cash is the bitcoin implementation which allows for bigger blocks and keep transactions cheap. Because of the prapaganda of the legacy bitcoin camp to smear bitcoin cash with illegitimate accusations of fraud and scam, the bitcoin cash community is excited to be recognized as a legitimate blockchain by being added to the most popular service to buy cryptocurrencies, Coinbase.
"I am a crypto noob but here is what i understand.

As bitcoin became more popular, its transaction fees were increased due to demand/supply but most importantly due to a deliberate architectural restriction on the maximum transactions per second. Basically the block size defines how many maximum transactions you can have per second.

Many people wanted to increase the block size, in order to increase the maximum transactions per second(thus lowering the transaction fee cost). 

But that would also increase the hardware requirements for miners and it would pose a significant risk to the decentralized nature of bitcoin. If hardware requirements got out of hand, then only few centralized data centers would be able to handle bitcoin.

So people argued about how much it should be increased. But then noone would agree. Anyway, some people decided that they would go ahead and fork(split) bitcoin and create bitcoin cash. They would have increased block size, thus lower transaction fees. For most intends and purposes, **bitcoin cash is a different currency than bitcoin**.

Some people think that bitcoin cash is too centralized and controlled by the bankers and shit. Bitcoin cash proponents argue that at least bitcoin cash is a usable currency, unlike bitcoin. They also argue that many developers behind bitcoin deliberately keep bitcoin handicapped(unusable due to fees), so they can propose their alternative centralized, bank controlled, blockchains on top of bitcoin.

There are a lot of money and astroturfing by all sides IMO. The reality of the fact is that it is hard to have a real decentralized system that can handle a high amount of transactions(visa level of transactions). So everyone is trying to become the new pimp, the new banks for the crypto era by pumping their own crypto.

Dont believe anyone. This subreddit is full of bitcoin cash proponents. /r/bitcoin is full of bitcoin proponents(but also heavily censored)."
Bitcoin Cash is essentially a linear solution to an exponential problem.
it formed off from bitcoin over the summer and has the older non segwit system still in place, it’s going places.

Good bot! 
"Careful who you trust, lots and lots and lots of FUD and lies from everyone on reddit, at the very least.

The tl;dr is that many people believe the current bitcoin core development group to be some combination of malicious or incompetent and they have refused to increase the block size (how many transactions can be done per ~10 minutes) and so transaction fees have gotten huge (~25$ per tx on average). 

There was a community proposal back a few months ago called the New York Agreement, NYA, where miners and businesses came together to update the network to twice as large blocks, as a stopgap fix for now. That attempt was called off because of it being contentious, which many here (myself included) would say was due to the core group not wanting to give up control as the ""reference client"" more or less, they were the biggest opponents.

So before the first part of the NYA went through (segwit), a group of developers forked the network with their own client, and created bitcoin cash (typically, BCH on exchanges, sometimes BCC). Bitcoin cash does not have segwit, and focuses on lower fees by having much larger blocks (8MB, vs core's 1MB).

Cash currently has negligible tx fees (pennies, or less), and many (including myself, again) see it as the true bitcoin, since it most accurately implements the system described by bitcoin's original creator, Satoshi Nakamoto in his whitepaper - https://bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf or https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf

Above, I link two sources for the whitepaper - bitcoin.com is run by Roger Ver who is pro-bitcoin cash, bitcoin.org is pro-core devs. I believe both pdfs are the same as of this post, but there was talk of changing it on the bitcoin core github, I'm not sure if that went anywhere, but that would be inexcusable if they did so. 

If you have any questions, please feel free to ask, I'll do my best to stick to the facts, but of course don't trust any one source.

It's all sort of a mess, really."
"> hearing that BCH is the real way to go?

They both may serve a purpose and both may be good investments.  No matter what anyone says, no one knows what the real way to go is, only time can tell.  Go with what you think will be best in the long run.  Both /r/btc and /r/bitcoin are severely biased so take any answers with a grain of salt."
After years and years of debate, then censorship, then all sorts of fake compromises and promises of upgrade, after huge market share loss to thousands of shitcoins, the [Flippening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J3VeogFUOs) might finally start to unravel.
"Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, and if you're feeling risky my personal bet on smaller coins is Ripple (XRP).  Those are the future.

Bitcoin was the first major crypto, but it has too many major flaws and is too big to change at this point.  It's not even a currency any more, so what's the point?

The basic utility that cryptocurrency provides is ... *currency!*  Bitcoin costs $20 to send $100, so it's overgrown its usefullness.  "
Its the real way to go if you don't want $30 transaction fees
"> Bitcoin cash does not have segwit

This tells you all you need to know about BCH.  r/BTC might as well be called r/BCH - you're not gonna find any unbiased opinions here."
"Basically there was a big disagreement over how to increase the capacity of the Bitcoin network. One group forked off (copied the code and started their own version) and called it Bitcoin Cash. So now there are two main ""versions"" of Bitcoin: Bitcoin Core/original, and Bitcoin Cash. 

Some people think the BCH method of speeding up the network is the best approach, and some people think the BTC method is the best approach. Now the market will decide which ends up being the superior option. No way to tell what will happen just yet. "
"Its confusing because people are pushing BCH as the ""real bitcoin"". One day some guy said, ""I want to create my own version of BTC"" So he pretty much copied BTC and branded it as BCH. I think both can be good investments and I own some of both, but the way BCH was created and claiming to be the ""real bitcoin"" is not right. It's trying to ride the BTC hype-train. He could have named it anything else...but went with ""bitcoin cash"". that's the real TL;DR."
No, you're Bitcoin Cash, listed on Coinbase right after Bitcoin

"
"I know I speak for all of us when I say thank you to Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong for recognizing the vision of Satoshi Nakamoto when he created Bitcoin as a ***Peer to Peer Electronic Cash Payment System***.  Not a store of value alone, or digital gold nuggets that have no utility.  

Bitcoin was created to put the power of people’s money back into their own hands. Without permission. And give them the freedom to transact on a scale of any size ***directly on a decentralized, World Wide Ledger***.  

Most of all, Bitcoin was designed to be ***faster*** and ***cheaper*** than the banking system, and bring transparency to financial transactions in an attempt to reduce corruption in Banking.  Remember the message he embedded into the first transaction ever:  

*”The Times Jan 03 2009 Chancellor on Brink of Second Bailout for Banks”* ( [website] (http://www.thetimes03jan2009.com) )

Brian, we know you [went to meet with the Core devs](https://blog.coinbase.com/what-happened-at-the-satoshi-roundtable-6c11a10d8cdf) before the fork, and asked them to reconsider.  They couldn't be bothered.  Now even the creator of Ethereum is [backing Bitcoin Cash and condemning the censorship](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/930276246671450112) on /r/ Bitcoin.

Peer to peer cash is me handing you a dollar, instantly, and for free.  Or as close as we can get to free. "
This is very exciting. I hope it really is the beginning of sense winning out over censorship and dogma. And if it is then, with any luck, people will hear the sad story of BTC and will be careful not to make the same mistakes.

"Sorry dude. You joined in the midst of a tumultous civil war, meaning you can't trust anything you don't know for yourself.

Without understanding the technology, it's impossible to decide which fork is better. But if you care about cheap transaction fees and high network throughput, BCH is the winner hands-down. I'd recommend learning about proof of work, hashing, sha256, the blockchain (merkle trees), mining (which you should understand if you understand pow + hashing + sha256), the relationship between blocksize and tx throughput, etc"

"The bitcoin network reached maximum capacity recently. For the better part of the last two years or so, everyone in the bitcoin community basically knew that we were approaching max capacity, and the community was divided about how to approach it. One part of the community wanted to increase the size of the ""blocks"" of transactions, which would increase the capacity of the network at the cost of requiring a bit more disk space on the network ""nodes"". The other part of the community favored inventing a seond ""layer"" of the bitcoin blockchain which sort of issues IOUs for small transactions, with the main blockchain handling fewer transactions which serve mainly to settle groups of transactions on the secondary chain.

The argument got contentious, and though attempts at compromise were made by major players from both sides of the debate, in the end no compromise was really reached. The part of the community that favored the ""big blocks"" approach split off and became Bitcoin Cash, keeping the same history of transactions as the main bitcoin blockchain from before the split but having its own distinct transaction history for dates after the split. The part of the community favoring a second layer for main transactions with the main layer for settlement stayed as Bitcoin.

Both sides troll each other endlessly because the debate about how to handle the network capacity limit problem was contentious, and there's a serious lack of any kind of reasonable community organization or stewardship in crypto so most of the arguing happened over the internet, which doesn't bring out the best in people."
I'm in the same boat, but I'm like 95% sure that I had some BTC on Coinbase during the fork.  I wasn't sure what was going to happen with Bitcoin so I moved what little I had at the time from my main exchange to Coinbase to be safe/  Even just going through my bought/sold history, I should have had some BTC on Coinbase regardless (only 0.002XXXBTC, but still).
"Think of it as a fork in the road. Both Bitcoins have the same history up to the fork point, but different after.

> I guess that means it was only copied at one instance, and isn't a running copy?

Correct."

Just lovely.  Sitting on 4 confirmations, about 90 minutes into my transfer to GDAX.  Thought I was fine when it hit 4 about 30 minutes ago.
A word of advice. Because of the selloff of stashed BCH in coinbase, the price will most likely drop to about 35-3600 before arbitrage from other exchanges and pumpers buying the dip. Therefore it's wise to probably set up a limit order at about 3600 and watch closely to increase your bid if the plateau comes before then. 
"Which trading system should i use if i am from EU and want one that doesnt use tethers? I really like the graph on bittrex(bars updated live, not just a line like on coinbase and bitstamp). GDAX says trading is unavailable in my region. Or maybe i should trust tethers and stay on bittrex?

It says BCH is temporarily disabled. When is this being fixed?

I wish i had more money to buy last night.. $1600 increase within a day, imagine the price after 3 months! https://www.tokens24.com/coin/bitcoin-cash/"
Bought a bunch of  1 year cloud mining contracts with BCH when it was still low... let's hope I get my money back (in terms of BCH) x.x. Thoughts?
Christmas time boy! You know the deal 😊
Dropped it right when BTC is looking to make a big correction.  Get your popcorn ready - things could get real interesting.  
I take back most of the bad things I said about Brian Armstrong, welcome back dude.
The bull run *is* the preannouncement.

"*UGH* the day I was supposed to buy bch for a bch transaction, shapeshift runs out of bch and this happens. On one hand I'm super happy and on the other I'm a few hours too late to make this transaction I've been planning =/

Can anyone here sell me bch for btc? I just need ~1.1 bch, I'll pay a premium!l"
Me too lol I was about to, 2 nights ago and now I’m full of regretti 
Get in on XRP then
Just in time for the holidays.....
Me too dude..
"They said it would be done ""by January 1st""  not in January.

There is only 2 more weeks before they would be late."
It has begun. See you in the stars gentlemen.
"And by “a few hours” Coinbase apparently means “maybe Wednesday.”

Nice roll out.

Could this have something to do with the huge run up on BCH today?
Apparently it was a drill.

Soon please, gotta ride this to the moon!
I just refreshed and saw bch in a nice shade of green! It says zero though and my wallet doesn't support bch yet though

Very exciting!
The bull run was caused by buyers knowing the announcement was coming out within hours.  Make no mistake, there are front runners.

"What a day to be involved in Bitcoin.

When 'Bitcoin Core' took over bitcoin and corrupted it with the help of the people behind r\bitcoin I thought bitcoin was lost for a while, but with bitcoin cash to continue the Bitcoin I knew and loved, *Bitcoin is back baby!*

**The moon is just the launchpad.** "
You beautiful bastard! :D
"Classic. This is a big deal, not to take away from it, but Coinbase shits the bed every single time there's high network volatility (lots of buys or sells), welcome to the party. 

To buy a dip or sell a peak you'll want a backup exchange. You *will* lose money if you leave it to CB. "

Just make sure you send to a personal wallet...

Bitcoin cash purchases are temporally disabled....
"Can anyone tell me why coinbase is listing bcc/bch at 8 k when most other exchanges are listing at 3 k ish? 
"
Coinbase is garbage. Can anyone recommend somewhere better?

The same green color as others have used, the rotated left 'B', and the logo inside of a green cash 'bill'

Insider trading. What else is new from a scam coin. 
Good thing I bought some yesterday, BCH is about to shine.
