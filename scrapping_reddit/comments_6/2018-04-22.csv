Because Reddit is a private company and r/bitcoin is a community, canâ€™t they have regulation based on set rules and still aline with free speech?
"Good thing the original coders,  with couple of mistakes along the way,  were 'competent' .  

Note that competence extends to understanding the economic incentives and  and role for each actor.  On that area,  I would say that Core and blockstream developers failed badly.  

Huge fees and slow transactions do not make a useful p2p payment system. "
Bitcoin hasn't been hacked till now with so much money at stake, that says something about the code. While the functionality defined may be fail proof, implementation matters a lot. A competent group of developers are more likely to generate far better code than incompetent ones or even average ones. So i would say developers are key to Bitcoin's success. Without competent developers Bitcoin fails.
