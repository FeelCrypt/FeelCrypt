"Nope, BTC is a store of value, BCH is the original idea, because unwanted influence are working hard on destroying the original idea.  Get lost, you don't know what is ""reasonable"""
It's almost as if you think every person on Earth has access to a trustworthy bank that's nearly free to use and a stable national currency to put in said bank.
Which part is not true? BCH is at around 20'000/day, while VISA&Mastercard do ~10'000'000'000/day. If you want to scale to VISA then you must be able to handle 500'000x the number of current transactions. And if you want to do microtransactions on top of that, multiply that by another 10'000x at least. That's why it should be obvious to anyone that a simple block size increase doesn't do shit. We need secure off chain transactions
"> The Lightning Network won't even work with 1 megabyte blocks. 

Yes it will. People are doing lightning transactions in testnet, which has 1mb blocks.

> Bitcoin Cash will scale, one way or the other. And the first step is to increase the blocksize dramatically. Everyone needing to run their own node is nonsense.

No it does only linear scaling and won't scale to a point where I envision bitcoin to be.

"Scare referes to ability to get an item. For example, gold is considered scare; but there is enough gold in the universe that every person could have 100 fully golden death stars. Scarcity isn't just about total supply. It's about total recoverable supply *at a moment in time*."
"Do you get paid to say stuff like that or do you actually believe it?

Let me make a watch out of Bitcoin. One second. 
"I hear the comparison to hold a lot but it fails miserable in my understanding... gold always has a use. There is a constant demand for it and the purpose is not to store it. You can craft engagement rings and you need gold in some applications in the industry. 
Of course you can store gold but it always has some utility (And normal money does not always have a utility - it's just paper and thats why people invest in gold).
Imo the comparison from btc and gold is simply not justified. "
"Look up the word ""speculation."""
Yeah, duh, you can send btc to other people! I completely forgot.
Sort of like what happened when Ver bought a bunch of BCH.  We saw the price rise.
Yes. At VISA&Mastercard levels you would need to include  70'000'000 transactions in each block. You'd need >30GB blocks. Good luck with that

"> I’m holding out that BTC will adjust to become a fast low fees peer-to-peer currency as their philosophy atm are slow, but stable adjustments and changes to the blockchain/scaling.

A conservative increase to 2MB would have been that kind of stable adjustment - but instead, they pushed SegWit through.

The problem with your line of thought is that they argued 'status quo unless consensus by all major players'. Problem is that no more on-chain scaling will happen with BTC now.

We have all tried very long and hard to reason with Core - and now we got the divorce:

BTC is for settlements and BCH is for P2P ecash.

I know which one I give long term prospects.

And the miners are now incentivized to keep this differentiation in approach ongoing, which means that BTC will have no luck scaling further on-chain. BTC would need the miners to agree to that.
"
BCH pumpers are out tonight i see. Get a grip of reality, change is here. Btc is here to stay and will adapt as the way it was meant too. It’s the mother of all cryptos. With time it’ll prove the nay sayers day by day. Believe it or don’t, it is going to be around forever.

You need valuable tokens as an incentive to mine a blockchain. Blockchains don’t function without tokens. The only ones that do are rendered centralized databases. And most are dead or dying. Haven’t heard anything about R3 in a long time.

"What bank is going to convert to a ""no transaction fee"" and ""no money creation"" business model?

Why do we need a bank with a blockchain when we already have a blockchain?"
If you sell your btc/bch you need to pay capital gains on it (if long term). Purchasing goods with crypto is considered a sell. There a re a few properties for sale around my area and they accept bitcoin. I wish I could buy it with btc/bch and not pay taxes on it - I wish. Feel free to google it. Japan does consider btc a currency therefore you can use it like it is meat to be.
I put my money where my faith is. I no longer hold legacy. BCH and diversification.
"The IRS has classified all cryptocurrencies as a capital asset; which means that you must track your basis and profit on every. single. transaction.  Then report, and pay capital gains on it.

Of course, every other department of the U.S. and it's state governments, classify it as something else entirely (whatever suits them best).  Courts tend to classify it as a currency.

Other governments, including Japan's have classified it as a currency across the board, and they will reap the benefits where the U.S., as usual, is being left behind because of the stupidity and statist attitudes which have come to dominate our society."
Though I agree that bitcoin needs scaling, increasing the block size isn’t the only way, that said, I’m not convinced of the feasibility of lightning network and the implementation of it anytime soon.
Yeah but the whole point of crypto is to avoid the issues of the fiat monetary system. Not to cause even more issues. 
"The ""deflationary spiral"" theory seems to get repeated a lot, but AFAIK there isn't much evidence of them in history outside the Great Depression. There was the  ""long depression"" in the late 1800's when the US government abruptly decided silver wasn't legal tender anymore, but that was more complicated than just deflation."
"**Metcalfe's law**

Metcalfe's law states that the value of a telecommunications network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system (n2). First formulated in this form by George Gilder in 1993, and attributed to Robert Metcalfe in regard to Ethernet, Metcalfe's law was originally presented, c. 1980, not in terms of users, but rather of ""compatible communicating devices"" (for example, fax machines, telephones, etc.). Only later with the globalization of the Internet did this law carry over to users and networks as its original intent was to describe Ethernet purchases and connections.

"> There’s nothing BTC has over other coins other than the first-mover advantage

First mover advantage is HUGE. Metcalfe's law: the value of a network is the square of its users. If we use r/bitcoin vs r/btc as a proxy for the number of users of bitcoin vs bitcoin cash respectively, bitcoin's network would be 23 times as valueable as bitcoin cash. And I think that's honestly overestimating the bch/btc ratio..
"
And pay taxes on your X amount of bch gains? not smart. Just buy it with fiat in the first place if you are going to buy more bch. You will be paying more money on taxes than on the fees.
It's like IRC? Freenode.net still up today. You use it or prefer WhatsApp? 
Then you're cryptocurrencying wrong.

Thanks for explaining why BTC will fall on its face.

With only 3tps, even with Lightning Network, Bitcoin can never onboard more than roughly one person every second (3 max).

Most CGT calculations work on a fifo basis (first in first out) so you probably would need to pay CGT in the example given above
"You are right, legal tender would be exactly what you defined I will correct that once I can clarify! Governments will choose their sovereign currency as the legal tender. Question now is... what is it digital currency other than just another means of payment, which isn’t classified as a capital asset. Is it any different then any other digital asset?
"
Yeah, kind of a bummer... but I guess it’s still early, we’ll see when crypto becomes more mainstream... I suspect there will be many legal confrontations in the future like “net neutrality”. I think Japan is still the most favorable jurisdiction for crypto in terms of sentiment toward it. I guess we will have to just keep an eye on these regulatory bodies to see how each of them react.
"No problem, please always feel free to ask questions here! (And if you don't get a satisfactory answer, feel free to shoot me a message, I may be able to join the discussion and help explain. I'm not an expert on Bitcoin, but I do consider myself an expert in explaining things.)

One of Bitcoin's cool revolutionary features is the idea of a ""distributed ledger"". Traditionally in ways of dealing with money, there would be one ledger (a list of who has access to however much funds), run by a money related institution (like an exchange, or a bank, or paypal, or venmo). That institution was a single point of failure for that system. If the company that maintains the ledger is compromised (by, say, the government, or hackers), then transactions can be censored, aka not allowed to happen, which is what happened with wikileaks, if I understand it correctly: paypal was barred from sending them donations by the government.

With a distributed ledger being maintained and updated by miners who are also distributed all over the world, that ledger becomes exponentially harder to compromise and censor. And in fact, wikileaks was still able to accept bitcoin, because nobody (not even the government) could stop the transactions from going through.

That distributed ledger is called the ""Blockchain"". The ledger is updated in sorts of ""batches"", called blocks, which are connected the the previous batch, making a chain of blocks, hence ""Blockchain"".

A little background on the above conversation:

This transaction history of the bitcoin network was originally only intended to be stored by those mining new transactions into the blocks. (In the original Bitcoin whitepaper, these mining entities were called ""nodes"".) Mere users who want to store and send funds can use ""SPV"" wallets, which are software that interact with the bitcoin network but don't require you to store the whole blockchain on your device.

Relatively recently, however, there's been a change in the narrative by the btc crowd arguing that  it's extremely important that **any user** be able to run software that keeps a copy of the ledger, on the grounds that it keeps bitcoin ""decentralized"", that it provides extra security to the person who keeps that copy, and it gives users power to ""vote"" in protocol ugrades. Those arguments don't hold water, however, and if you'd like to know why I'd be happy to get into it. But that's a bit too much of a tangent to dive into without making sure you want to read another wall of text =P"
"There are many things in what you write.

Finally. Blockstream's business plan is to make money off its own technologies: sidechains.

To do that, they need to literally cripple BTC ([this](https://twitter.com/BTCNewsUpdate/status/927969435033497605) is one reference) to prepare to bootstrap their business off Bitcoin's brand. 

The crippling is probably going to be fatal to the Bitcoin brand but that doesn't matter at all. LN and Blockstream's sidechains are built for not just BTC but for many other coins too (LTC, VCT, Groestlcoin, etc.). In any case, once all merchant and payment infrastructure is lost by Bitcoin as it is diverted to LN, their system can and probably will work directly off fiat: no need for cryptocurrencies.

VC Investors have put very high risk capital into Blockstream in the tens of millions. They would never have done it without expecting billions in return if Blockstream's plan works (20 times return on investment is the average VC return expectation for successful investments).

"I'll be honest sure. If btc continues being slow with high fees, bch will be trump. However, if lightning does get implemented, it will be fast and cheap. Right now btc is finally starting to have the adoption, but not the utility it once had. Bch has the utility, but no adoption, you can't even buy with fiat in the U.S. It easier and faster to implent lightning that it will be to replace btc. For bch to trump, the entire crypto market would crash, everyone would say ""told you itbwas a bubble"" etc etc because btx with no utility has no value. And some year later, when the market has confidence again, bch would start to rise."

Without that, your currency won't be valuable, and therefore isn't worth accepting as payment (and therefore can't be used to make payment). The currencies that ensure protocol consistency and widespread consensus for protocol changes are the currencies that will dominate the next few hundred years. "

That's simply a lie and the lack of reference doesn't make this true. The lightning whitepaper was mainly written by josephpoon ([see here](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/paper/graphs/contributors)). He's not working for Blockstream. He's now working with Vitalik on similar scaling solutions for Ethereum ([source](https://plasma.io/plasma.pdf)).

What you're probably referring to is rustyrussell's contributions to the [RFC specifications](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/graphs/contributors), where he clearly has the most commits.

When it comes to implementations of the lightning protocol, we have 3 different developments going on in parallel:

- A version written in GO: [1](https://github.com/LightningNetwork/lnd/)

- Rusty's version (Blockstream), written in C: [2](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning)

- A version written in SCALA: [3](https://github.com/acinq/eclair)

3 if we are unlucky.
That's the problem though even though everyone can admit to the major issues, Core/Blockstream does not want on-chain scaling. They want small blocks, high fees and slow confirmations to justify the need for their off-chain products, such as Liquid(https://elementsproject.org/sidechains/liquid/). This is the only way that Blockstream will be able to repay the $76 million to their investors. No BTC supporter has been able to give me any other plausible way that Blockstream will be able to repay investors. Not to mention the massive Tether controversy that could cause a HUGE crash if the currency ends up being printed money. Things need to happen now not after the entire crypto market crashes and confidence in the tech is lost.

Of course it's a very technical conversation.   What non-technical uninformed people think simply doesn't count.

>The odds of all hubs conspiring

Although it's possible that they will conspire with each other .... it's just as much of a concern that individual hubs will ""conspire"" against their local users.   Eg.  by running KYC for the government before allowing you to transact.    It will take a lot of ongoing available capital to be able to run a hub  (MUCH more than running a bitcoin node that was capable of 1GB blocks, which is 4 cores, and 30mbps internet - ie. the computer I am typing this to you on right now).

>Less centralized the bch's model of miners

"It's been at least 5 years since proof of stake was invented, and BTC hasn't even adapted itself to that. What chance do you think it has to adapt to the next 5 years of innovations in DLT?? It is completely ruled by entrenched interests of the Chinese mining cartels. 

Meanwhile BTC network doing some fine work wasting 0.15% of the planet's electricity generation on processing about 0.01% of the payment volume of MA or Visa - at best.

"This is a copy paste: Thanks for taking the time to put that together.  It's even more info than I had hoped for. 

So, out of over [300 Core Developers](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/graphs/contributors), 11 are employed by Blockstream.

11/300+, is that really ""many""?  I wouldn't have thought so.

And, as your research has shown, Blockstream employees only make up 2 out of the top 10 all time, and 4 out of the top 20, in terms of all time commits.  So, not only are they not dominating in terms of body count, neither are they dominating in terms of commits contributed. 

And that's *all-time*, so it includes commits from the early days when only a handful of people were active on the project (so that they would have worked up a load of all time commits), and before Blockstream even existed.

If we look at commits from the past two years (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/graphs/contributors?from=2015-11-15&to=2017-11-14&type=c
), who from Blockstream is in the top 10 contributors?  Just Sipa.

Again, I think that Blockstream's influence is overplayed by some for the sake of a conspiracy theory.

For a slightly more sober look at Core funding, you might consider [an article from last year in Bitcoin Magazine](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/who-funds-bitcoin-core-development-how-the-industry-supports-bitcoin-s-reference-client-1459967859/).  It looks at the involvement of MIT, Blockstream, Chaincode, Ciphrex and BTCC, in a list which it describes as inconclusive.

When it comes to Blockstream, it mentions that 

> As part of their contracts, all Blockstream developers also have time-locked bitcoins to ensure they are incentivized to work toward Bitcoin's success. These contracts also include so-called “morality clauses”: If Blockstream asks any of them to work against what they consider to be in Bitcoin's best interest, they can refuse to do so while still guaranteed a salary.


The final question, I would ask people to consider is, if we disregard ALL of the evidence above and cling to the theory that Blockstream has had a malign influence on Bitcoin code, then how much Blockstream-influenced code has been removed from the Bitcoin Cash codebase?

History shows that Gavin left the project and started contributing to competing clients.  His access to the repo was revoked as you could expect any non-contributing developer's.   Strangely enough, around the same time that  Gavin said CW was Satoshi.  Roger was definitely selling Bitcoin as a get rich schematic, which shows you aren't paying attention.

So I did google it... and, unfortunately, I have to report that Bitcoin is NOT a legal ~~currency~~ tender in Japan according to the most recent regulations.

Japan officially recognizes bitcoin and digital currencies as a ""means of payment that is not a legal ~~currency~~ tender"" (see Article 2-5 of Japans's Payment Services Act (PSA) May 25, 2016) .

Specifically (translated):
——————————————————

The amended Payment Services Act defines Bitcoin and other virtual currency as

1. Property value that can be used by unspecified persons for payment of equivalent value for purchased goods, rental fees, or services, that can be purchased by or sold to unspecified persons, and that is transferable via an electronic data processing system (limited to property values that are stored electronically on electronics, excluding currency and currency denominated assets); or

2. Property value that can be mutually exchangeable for 1 above with unspecified persons and is transferable via an electronic data processing system. (Amended Payment Services Act, art. 2 ¶ 5.)

——————————————————

This classifies it as a property used as a means of payment but not a legal ~~currency~~ tender and not a capital asset. 

Most regulatory bodies I’ve seen classify it as a property (Japan does as well as it clearly states “Property value”) and taxed similarly. I agree that sale of property will invoke capital gains tax. In the case of crypto this is not so straight forward... especially on exchange/payment for goods. That would be a property to property exchange with no conversion to fiat and is more akin to bartering which is taxable in a completely different manner in every jurisdiction. Example: ""Proceeds from Broker and Barter Exchange Transactions"" 1099-B

Functionally, this wouldn’t be as easy as slapping a sales tax (or it could?)... a crypto to crypto exchange in the US would likely find itself in a “like-kind” exchange (tax deferred like virtual items in a game), but for all other types exchanges it may not be that simple.

"Well we have to disagree here about crypto currency being a capital asset. The reference for this would be here: https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-virtual-currency-guidance

The Notice 2014-21 which you can read here:
https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-14-21.pdf

Q-1:  How is virtual currency treated for federal tax purposes? 

A-1:  For federal tax purposes, virtual currency is treated as property.  General tax principles applicable to property transactions apply to transactions using virtual currency. 

Q-2:  Is virtual currency treated as currency for purposes of determining whether a transaction results in foreign currency gain or loss under U.S. federal tax laws? 

A-2:  No.  Under currently applicable law, virtual currency is not treated as currency that could generate foreign currency gain or loss for U.S. federal tax purposes. 

Q-7:  What type of gain or loss does a taxpayer realize on the sale or exchange of virtual currency? 

A-7:  The character of the gain or loss generally depends on whether the virtual currency is a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer.  A taxpayer generally realizes capital gain or loss on the sale or exchange of virtual currency that is a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer.  For example, stocks, bonds, and other investment property are generally capital assets.  A taxpayer generally realizes ordinary gain or loss on the sale or exchange of virtual currency that is not a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer.  Inventory and other property held mainly for sale to customers in a trade or business are examples of property that is not a capital asset. See Publication 544 for more information about capital assets and the character of gain or loss. 

So whether it’s classified as a capital asset is... maybe? This advisory was, I believe, released because certain crypto currencies would be considered securities under the Howey Test.

Let’s dig deeper and go to Publication 544
https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p544.pdf#page22

First Section 2. Capital Asset and Noncapital Asset.

So the answer is pretty straight forward if the crypto is considered a security per Howey test = capital asset... if not it’s just a noncapital asset.

For a framework and guidelines on which tokens are and are not securities... you can read the following draft: https://www.coinbase.com/legal/securities-law-framework.pdf

The conclusion is crypto currencies that are structured as simple contracts or license agreements are not securities.

*So, is crypto currency a capital asset?* The answer, I believe, is it depends... but I’m going to argue, for the majority of them, *NO* for the following reason... the majority are not securities and second this will set a precedent that is ridiculously difficult to enforce. Instead of crypto currency let’s use another similar digital asset that is used in trade and can [potentially] appreciate in value... virtual items in a game (property). Your suggestion would require that if a player “exchanged” one item for another item in-game (both of which have a market value outside the game) there would be a taxable event. Meaning you would need to record that... How would  that even be enforced?

This is why, I believe, there is a very robust section “Nontaxable Exchanges: Like-Kind Exchange” that defines very clearly the requirements to qualify as a “like-kind exchange”, which from what I’ve seen crypto qualifies as."
"That's not how taxes work, you pay taxes off proffit.

If you buy 1 bch for $1000 and instantly buy a tv you pay no taxes since you've made no profit of your bch investment. 

Edit: I might be wrong here, sorry. I'm emailing my local tax representative to figure this out, it really would be really dumb if you had to pay taxes of your oldest coin, but too be fair often I wouldn't rule out ""really dumb"" as a definition for our tax system :|"
"There also has never been an intangible, cyber, decentralized, crypto currency throughout history.

At the end of the day, people actually still use and sell things like gold. For example gold is minted unto collectable coins, it's used in medicine, electronics, art, etc. 

Bitcoin doesn't have any use other than being held onto, or used to buy something. Thus if it were to be deemed a currency, the idea is that people are holding onto it and investing in it so that one day it can be spent. However, if they never actually spend it, then it's not a currency, it's merely a store of value (since it would only be sold to convert into a curreny like $USD to then use to actually purchase something). So yea, if people never actually use the bitcoin to buy something, in fear of missing out on future gain, then it is in effect not being used as a currency. "
Not instant settlement though. 6 months! BTC is instant settlement. The real problem is that BCH or any other mined coin can do instant settlement for thousands of times cheaper. 
"This law is relevant only if the network is actually used for something

All that remains of BTC at the moment is a pyramid where people with early buy-ins are now being employed at marketing BTC to idiots by the same buying in now into a $200 billion crypto asset that sits completely unused. 

When demand saturates, there will be no more incentive left to perpetuate the lies and BTC will start to be seen as the shitcoin it really is. The next 10 alts on the list are all strictly superior to BTC as a coin, ETH/XRP/Monero cover any usecase it might have had better, and BCH is better at being Bitcoin (in terms of how it was originally intended to work) than BTC is at this point.

Or maybe I'm underestimating the number of greater fools left. We shall see."
Same applies to bch. Every is speculating that retailer are going to accept it. So far there are none (major retailers)

Yeah trump is a failed multiple bankrupt conman. Cuban has at least been successful. 
"So you consider the lightning protocol as ""cheap shot from a company like Blockstream to serve their own agenda"". Have you checked who all is working on lightning projects?"
Sorry to ask, I'm very new here. What does storing the blockchain mean?
Oh dear... 
I guess I was wrong about Japan. Shit, I was looking at Japan as a model for treating a currency. Well, it is capital gains what we are all trying to avoid. People will spend their btc/bch in amazon, dealerships, realstate if they don't need to pay capital gains. The Japan model would be a good start IMO. Thanks for looking into it.
"Not legal tender; but a legal currency (as opposed to a capital asset).  I believe that is what it means and it is getting slightly confused or lost in the translation.  Government's will typically only choose and allow one ""legal tender"", which just means that it is a currency which a creditor and the government must accept as payment for debts."
Yes I know what you meant, sorry I just felt like teasing :/ It is because of the theory of abiogenic oil you talked about. I don't think it is true
They are refering to sales taxes like vat or gst surely? 
If it is considered an investment then you pay taxes on the gain when you sell. It doesn’t matter if you buy more a few minutes later. You don’t get to deduct the investment when you make it. Then again I’m not a CPA, just a hodler.
"Negative.  FIFO (first-in-first-out) or similar method of determining basis, is required by the IRS.  So, if you have any current BCH holdings, you would have to calculate your profit as if you were ""selling"" your oldest BCH in order to buy that TV.

/u/richyboycaldo is absolutely correct in everything they've said.  It is so important that bitcoiner's learn how damaging the u.s. governments (and some other ham-handed governments around the world) have been to the development of bitcoin into an actual currency."
"> There also has never been an intangible, cyber, decentralized, crypto currency throughout history.

OK, so you admit there is scant historical evidence to support the ""deflationary spiral.""

> if they never actually spend it, then it's not a currency

Well, first of all, some people do spend it. But what makes you think people will ""never"" spend it? Naysayers are constantly talking about what people ""never"" do with their bitcoins. Part of the reason people are ""speculating"" with bitcoin now is because they predict it to be more functional in 5, 10, 30 years. If bitcoin isn't being spent regularly in 30 years, yes, it has failed. There is absolutely nothing wrong with a high-risk speculative investment in an alternative currency with great future potential. But you seem to be applying an arbitrary deadline for bitcoin's world domination...be patient. It might fail, it might not, but the fact that it isn't used like USD in 2017 doesn't mean much either way."
"Except that it isn't a pyramid scheme. A pyramid scheme isn't sustainable without growth and collapses. Bitcoin can perfectly be a stable store of value without growth.

The transaction price of of BTC is a major issue to sustain its high value, but it's not a pyramid scheme."
"> marketing BTC to idiots

Yup, bitcoin isn't an evolving and improving technology at all. I don't expect anything to come from the bitcoin community in the next 5 years. Nobody goes to that shitcoin anymore, its too crowded. /s /heavy-eye-rolling

This might be the only place we can agree right now. But I can't imagine you're happy with monero's fees."
If there's a limit order on the books to buy 1000 BTC at a specific price, there needs to be sell orders > 1000 BTC to fully remove that order and move the best bid price lower. Although of course there's nothing stopping that buyer from cancelling or changing their order at any time.
Your hypothetical is a legal grey area, who choses which coins you're selling when you buy the tv? Unless you specifically setup a seperate wallet for the tv purchase and use those, but now we're getting even further abstracted from a real use case
What you wrote is not true
"Just saying ""Bitcoin Cash can't scale to Visa/Mastercard"" doesn't make it true. Do you have anything to back up your claim?"
Is there a reason why this won't change with time and competing exchanges?
Marc Cuban is an asshole. Can’t believe how much money this fuck stick made off the steaming pile of shit that was broadcast.com.
use litecoin or dash for currency
...and then, there was Bitcoin Cash.
"No shit?

You are comparing the second layer, centrally settled scaling solution of a global currency to the base layer of a different global currency, bitcoin."
dfasadfasdfa
A very noob question: how does the value of BTC then increases? 
"If BTC’s sole purpose becomes a store of value it will be in big trouble. It works as long as people keep pumping money in. But it will crumble like fractional banking if everyone tries to pull out their funds. 

Every historic good store of value has a secondary use case if you think about it "
anything based on subjective value is probably worth $0.00 somewhere
Hmm stating the obvious, maybe Mark Cuban is Satoshi.  
"He should look into Bitcoin Cash, it's the real Bitcoin as per Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper.  Bitcoin Core from bitcoin.org is a mutated version that gives power to a handful of corrupt players (blockstream/core).

Bitcoin was not designed as a store of value, it is supposed to be a peer to peer electronic cash system.   "
"Clearly someone needs to educate Cuban about high level economic concepts such as ""store of value,"" ""digital gold,"" and ""moon."" He just doesn't get it..."

"This is what layer 2 solutions are for. This is why atomic swaps are a thing. Litecoin is the solution to Bitcoin's scaling problem.

I never heard that argument before! Those TV entrepreneurs are almost as genius as those, who heard first of it by them. 
He summed it up himself when he said he is  “more spectator.” Had he actually used it he would find that his statement is not true. I transferred about $8,000 the other day for about 50 cents. 
"Cuban's thoughts are evolving. But he still does not fully understand the tech. I don't hold it entirely against him; Bcore rate-limiting is slowing down more than just Bitcoin performance, it's helping to keep people in the dark. Maybe he'll come around when Bitcoin Cash wins. Also, it's common when you have paper fortune to not be able to see beyond it -

Cuban honestly needs to stfu, it's not a collectible, and if it were it'd be taxed at higher rates by the IRS than most investment assets, which would be ridiculous.
Once all bitcoins are mined how does the network stay afloat? Isn’t it miners that Process all transactions?
Bitcoin just got cup checked by the shark tank. That’s what bitcoin gets for being a basic a$$ B!tch! I wonder what it’s going to take for miners to care more about principle than profit. 
Context.
That's on the assumption that bitcoin makes no new updates to speed up transactions or reduce fees which is highly unlikely.
This guy made all his money by simply indexing the news on a shitty HTML website back in the 90s. The guy is by no means technical, but does understand the value behind information. I would take anything he says regarding technology with a grain of salt. He has no clue what he's talking about in my opinion.
good thing IOTA can fix that little problem, with a windows update.
But does Mark support BCH? I thought he was more into Ethereum.
this why a lot us believe Amazon and Walmart will choose Bch and Eth as their crypto payment method of choice.
I can't take people who believe that there is such a thing as intrinsic value seriously

I try to leave it at 10% at most, but it keeps turning into the most of my wealth.

"“If they were truly currencies, you wouldn’t try to convert them or value them based off of other currencies. [Their value] would just be intrinsic,” 

Aren't all currencies basing their value off of the American dollar?"
Sounds like a problem Litecoin can solve 😀
-13 downvotes for bitcoin in a bitcoin sub ?  Do you realy think MasterCard is faster And cheaper ?
I’m going to need Cuban to do some math. CC charge as much as 5% PLUS $.50 a transaction and THEN hit u with ridiculous interest and yearly fees, late fees and service fees. Excuse us while we try to educate the world on the cost of their current financial “Normal”. Mark the newest paid shill?
Dash is awesome 
The thing is though, bitcoin wasn't supposed to have an value at all. This was supposed to be some crazy ass science experiment that was never going to work. People are a funny lot though, tell them they can control their financial destiny and enough of them will take you up on it! Fees suck, bitcoins don't.

What's ledger? I ask because I want to put in context of bockchain fees. It should be free or maybe a few cents to send any amount of crypto, but some people (blockstream) have fucked up btc. Ether, btc cash, litecoin, are all free or pennies to send any amount.

Under US law it’s not a currency but it’s been at least referred to and classified as an asset/property by the IRS comment on crypto currency. Therefore, by that definition, an exchange between like for like should be tax free (e.g. Bitcoin to Ethereum) and otherwise taxed as property on a sale (e.g. Bitcoin to USD). This is not much different from trading, for example, game virtual assets (not taxable until a sale to fiat)."

"While the folks around here will be happy you used the word ""upgrade"", it wasn't exactly what you'd think of as an upgrade; it was a fork, where some people disagreed with the direction Bitcoin was going in, so they split off from Bitcoin, making a new coin called Bitcoin Cash that implemented the upgrade they wanted, and everyone with Bitcoin got the same amount of Bitcoin Cash. You can argue forever about which is ""better"", but the original Bitcoin still has the largest market share. There have also been less successful forks of Bitcoin, like Bitcoin Gold."

If you’re in America, that’s probably how you’re used to seeing them. I’m Australian, and see all currencies against the Australian dollar. But yes, it absolutely makes sense to view the value of one currency against another. 
"That’s a really great question and I think the shortest answer is that they actually aren’t.  Japanese people do not base the value of their money off the American dollar (they don’t translate it in their head before making a purchase decision). The average citizen couldn’t give two shits what a dollar is worth. They probably don’t even know what Yen would convert to in dollars. They just know that a Big Mac costs about 320 Yen. Make sense?

Currencies are kind of like languages in that people “think in terms of them”. Creating a new currency is like trying to create a new language. Sure maybe all the rules work and make sense and it’s a “better, faster, and more efficient way of speaking”, but a language or currency isn’t truly adopted if people keep having to translate it to the one they do think in terms of. I think it’s fair to say that what Mark Cuban is saying is that until enough people start using and thinking of Bitcoin as their primary money, it’s no more a currency than Pig Latin is a language.

The aim with storing value isn't that it increases in value it's just that it doesn't decrease.
It’s essentially a Ponzi scheme at that point. I’m holding out that BTC will adjust to become a fast low fees peer-to-peer currency as their philosophy atm are slow, but stable adjustments and changes to the blockchain/scaling. Quality over quantity(quantity in this case would be fast updates). However, if they ever fully commit to being a store of value, I’m out. There’s nothing BTC has over other coins other than the first-mover advantage, which is huge and is buying time for the developers to upgrade at a slow pace, but eventually if BTC stays the same, I️ think it will die. 
Everyone knows this, even in Bitcoin.
Because there is more people wanting to buy its then sell.

Why assume that? I think it's fine **if** system requirements are such that a small percentage of businesses, universities (they commonly run Linux update servers already), and determined hobbyists can setup a node.

Each transaction represents a small slice of time, network, and storage. New technologies lower the cost to mine a transaction but it is *never* free to mine a transaction.  Every miner knows what his marginal cost to accept a transaction is. No miner is required to ever mine any transaction at a loss.
If there are 1 million transactions in a block, even if they only pay $0.10 each, that's still $100k in revenue. Bitcoin was always intended to be cheap, and miners would be incentivized by large volume.

Also note that while no miner is ever required to mine at a loss, that doesn't mean that a miner can't choose to mine at a loss, or fail to calculate cost correctly.

Then it would be an interesting excercise to calculate this minmal fee, then you could work out the cost to almost fill blocks at different sizes.

> In the star topology you mentioned earlier, where `A` is a central node connecting `B` through `E`, imagine it connects to another star where `E` is the central node, with `F` through `J` as the points.

Okay, I had to get out my (digital) pencil for this one. So you're describing a network that looks [like this](https://imgur.com/2Jm7cfL)?

> `B` is connected to `C` through `A`, and connected to `G` through `A` and `E`.

Yes, that's correct.

> Can `B` close with `C` without also closing its channel to `A`?

In that graph, the only channel that `B` has ownership of is the `B/A` one. `B` could settle with `A` at any time and close that channel, but as that's `B`'s only channel, that would cut `B` off from making any Lightning Network payments to any of the other nodes (and prevent any of them from paying `B` via the Lightning Network) until `B` opened another channel with _somebody_ (could be `A` again, or anyone else in the network).

> Channel closings could potentially cascade in a domino effect

`B` closing their channel (`B/A`) would not force any other other channels to close. Perhaps `B` only joined this network to pay to `C`, and now that their transaction is done, `B`'s fine disconnecting, but that channel closing does not close the `C/A` channel, and therefore does not cut `C` out of the network too.

> Another question: since liquidity providers are valuable (if not essential), what incentivizes them? Do nodes charge fees for passing transactions through?

The logic I've heard is that any node in the network can set a fee that they'd charge to be the middleman (or one of several middlemen) in a transaction. I haven't heard of any plans to have set fees on a single individual channel (though the person you're in the channel with may be a merchant and charge you sales tax or whatnot). 

> What mitigates the risk of centralization?  It seems like there's incentive among users to connect to nodes with more connections, and more connections requires more liquidity.

The same logic that applies to mining; any miner can get selective about what minimum fees it would accept, but any community member could start mining and under-bid them. Same with Lightning Network hubs; anyone could start being a ""hub"" (there's no special functionality of a ""hub""; it's just a network node that chooses to open many channels to many people. Typical users only need to connect to a handful of other nodes, and in theory that will interconnect them with individuals/companies that are more highly interconnected, and the entirety of the network. The other aspect is that for a Lightning Network as a user, do you _need_ to be connected to _everyone_? No; you only need to be connected to those you want to make a payment to. You could open direct channels to those people/merchants and be done, and only maintain a few channels at a time. It's only people/companies that want to make it their job (to get a profit) being on the network that would need to maintain many open links (and therefore have a bunch of liquidity tied up in them).

> The conventional wisdom in crypto is ""don't keep your funds in a hot wallet, they're more vulnerable!"", so unless that's just nonsense, running a highly-liquid Lightning node entails some extra amount of risk, so it seems like there must be some incentive if we expect enough liquidity providers to keep the system running efficiently.

Well sure, hot wallets are slightly more vulnerable than cold wallets, but if you're spending the funds, they need to be in some ""hot"" wallet connected to the network. As an end user, you would still likely keep your life savings in a separate, cold wallet, and would have your weekly/monthly expenses (like the monthly Netflix example I gave) open in channels. And having a channel open wouldn't preclude you from using a hardware wallet to maintain the private keys used to open the channels (desktop lightning network clients would just need to call out to the hardware wallet every time they needed something signed), for good security.

For an individual/company intending to set themselves up as a hub/liquidity provider, yes it means more of their funds need to be committed to open channels ""just in case"" funds need to flow back to their connections, which is one reason them charging a fee is reasonable (since it compensates them for the risk they're taking having more funds locked into the network).

> My take-away from this paragraph is that implementation is going to be the biggest factor in Lightning's success; it's a complex system, and mitigating that complexity through a well-designed interface will make a huge difference in the amount of risk exposure that users face. As a late(ish) adopter, I'm lucky to have entered the crypto space with several user-friendly options--Coinbase, Exodus wallet, Ledger Nano S, etc.--but early adopters had to surmount significant obstacles. ... All theoretical issues aside, if the Core devs (et al) can bring something as complex as Lighting Network to the mainstream in a secure and user-friendly way, that will be an incredible achievement.

Oh, now you're making me feel old :) 

Anyone joining into the Bitcoin community now is still an early(ish) adopter, and while the price-focused individuals [will post memes of](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7gnorl/reminder/) ""If you can't handle my 20% dips, you don't deserve my 600% gains"", to some extent the same applies for the technology side as well. The initial intent of the Bitcoin software had the mentality of being a paradigm shift, where everything changes to a new way of doing things; start over and do things better. People joining in now still need to bear that in mind that the major changes aren't over yet, at least not from the Bitcoin Core team. Their development style I characterize as the Tortoise from the Tortoise and the Hare; slow and steady wins the race, and keeping their focus way ahead. (The counter-argument of ""but they could go a _little bit_ faster"" or ""focus on things happening a _little bit_ sooner"" is valid though too; some balance is needed there.) With that mentality, the analogy of how derivative technologies and behaviors evolved as the automobile gained popularity makes sense. Early adopters of automobiles had to grit their teeth through ""red flag laws"", and even after you learned how to drive an automobile (something _very_ different from anything else they would have done at the time), they then had to keep on learning new behaviors (like obeying a mindless red/green light at intersections), new security (how you secure a car is much different than how you secure a horse, and changed as cars did, from keys to security systems). There's still more changes to come, so adopters getting involved now should definitely not expect the learning curve to be done after their initial introduction. And myself as an application developer and interface designer definitely agree with you that Bitcoin as a whole is in an era of needing good interfaces that give users the ability to be in control, but with well-designed guardrails to show/encourage appropriate actions. The Lightning Network development has at least [three active teams](https://cdecker.github.io/lightning-integration/) working to make sure their separate implementations all work together, so we'll hopefully shortly have three different interfaces to start critiquing and optimizing for user experiences!
"
">So you're describing a network that looks like this?

Precisely.

>`B` closing their channel (`B`/`A`) would not force any other other channels to close. Perhaps `B` only joined this network to pay to `C`, and now that their transaction is done, `B`'s fine disconnecting, but that channel closing does not close the `C`/`A` channel, and therefore does not cut `C` out of the network too.

Oh, I see where I was confused now; I was still thinking in terms of the relationship between `B` and `C`, which is actually irrelevant to the network--`B` has no direct contract with `C`, so doesn't settle with `C`; for `B` the only channel that matters is the one with `A` here.  Got it.

>The logic I've heard is that any node in the network can set a fee that they'd charge to be the middleman (or one of several middlemen) in a transaction. I haven't heard of any plans to have set fees on a single individual channel (though the person you're in the channel with may be a merchant and charge you sales tax or whatnot). [...] The same logic that applies to mining; any miner can get selective about what minimum fees it would accept, but any community member could start mining and under-bid them.

Okay, this is what I thought.  So Lightning Network in a sense will create a competitive ecosystem based on transaction fees between level-1 and level-2, with level-1 fees effectively maintaining a ceiling on level-2 fees.  The floor on level-1 (direct blockchain txns) fees will be set according to the same factors that sets it now (e.g. how full the mempool is, etc.) coupled with the rate of channel openings and closings, while the floor on level-2 fees will be set by...well, I'm not sure yet what the major influences will be.  

But in any case, it seems like miners and nodes are now in competition for the fee market, but miners have no mechanism to improve their competitiveness other than somehow getting the community to support a hard fork that would make on-chain transactions cheaper...which the community has no incentive to support unless something causes the fee ceiling to rise on both levels (which I don't know how that would happen, since the costs to run a node will always be cheaper than the cost to mine, right?).  This isn't a problem as long as there is at least enough profit in mining to keep enough hash power on the network to handle whatever amount of level-1 transactions are demanded, but this does create incentive among miners to support alternative currencies that offer on-chain scaling methods that are competitive with level-2 solutions in terms of speed, fees, and low friction experience.  From a user perspective, all that matters (with all else being equal) are those aspects.

But then, miners could just run Lightning Nodes, too, so the question is, can they run them competitively with financial institutions?  I see now why the debate between level-1 and level-2 scaling methodologies is typically cast as a ""banks vs. miners"" battle.  Level-2 solutions pose the same problems as hybrid PoW/PoS systems, wherein investors can either opt for sinking capital into mining equipment or the currency itself.  The currency is safer and more liquid than mining hardware, especially specialized mining hardware, which means it will be a race to the bottom in terms  of network hashpower as LN profits rise relative to mining profits.  Seems like the result will be crippling the blockchain as much as the market will bear, potentially beyond that if enough users and miners flock to an on-chain competitor...unless Bitcoin goes full PoS and does away with miners entirely.  That seems like it may be an inevitable end-game in the move to level-2 solutions.

Hmm, it will be interesting to see how this plays out.  In any case, you've successfully answered my security concerns about Lightning Network, and the only concerns I have left are regarding how quickly and frictionlessly it can be implemented, and whether the community and network can handle the shift in incentives.  If hashpower flight occurs after LN adoption and makes it so opening and closing txns are as expensive and slow as on-chain txns currently are (or worse), and the community cannot transition quickly and effectively to another security model (PoS or maybe something else?), that is going to be trouble.  But perhaps that threat will be enough for Lightning Nodes to act in a way that keeps mining profitable or something?  Either way, there's bound to be more drama!"

"On both chains, there is a block time target of 10 minutes. While this value fluctuates based on how many miners are participating and random chance, both chains adjust to try to steer the block time to 10 minutes.

On the BTC chain, 1 1MB block every 10 minutes is not enough to process all transactions, so there is a backlog. Most miners prioritize transactions that have higher fees attached, so they get processed first. Lower fee transactions may have to wait several block times before they are included in a block.

On the BCH chain, 1 8MB block every 10 minutes contains enough transaction space to prevent this backlog from happening."
Block size limit is a limit on how much transaction data the network permits miners to process. The lower the limit, the sooner the network hits the roof and stops working correctly. Transactions begin to compete for space, so the fees go up, and the network becomes unpredictable and unreliable, driving both old and new users away (including merchants).

"No, you were correct the first time. What I mean with ""the network hits the roof"" is that there is more text (transactions) to write on the current book than the book allows. So we have to write it in loose pages and keep them next to us, because maybe we can fit them in the next book we write. But the next book comes, and again we can't fit all the text in it, so now we have even more loose pages next to us, and they keep piling up. Eventually there is no more room even for the loose pages, so we start throwing them away (which means the network now says those bitcoins never even left the wallet. This makes 0 confirmation transactions unreliable)."

Anyway, few) coding for it instead of 1 for BTC, which means more diversity and choice for the community. Announced plans for BCH are looking great while those for BTC (LN) are... eh. More centralization? Yeah sure that's totally what I want.
Almost like your tx fees will increase indefinitely regardless of the price the next time you have a real congestion like two weeks ago!
Indeed. 
You used to be able to tip in Bitcoin. That was shutdown not long after blocks became full.
The idea around tipping newcomers is that it will encourage people to take the first step into owning Bitcoin. 
hey if you don't want free money, someone else will take it
Haha, yeah I guess. 10 cents isn't that much tbf but I have seen large tips in the past.

"They are more like pages added to a read-only book.

sometimes the last few pages can be replaced (reorganization), which is why 6 confirmations are suggested for large purchases.

Yes, so multiple players in the market is a good thing. This thread infers that there is one winner...a monopoly. 
I do the opposite, but it is sssoooo hard to spend legacy bitocin these days because it's ssuuuuupppppeeerrrr slow and way too expensive for normal use
"Probably pruned from mempool by now.

Soon all transactions will be pruned, because all transactions are spam, and all users are spammers. /s"
I've downvoted your account enough now, probably due to inane insubstantial or outright bullshit comments, that you are finally tagged as a core shill. Have a nice day.
"Give it away...that's how you win indeed! And buy back btc! ;)"
I think this means one simple thing: Fewer people want to give up their BTC.
Why does there need to be a winner. Bitcoin can be the gold storage coin that people save and bitcoin cash can be what we use for every day commerce. Then we can all get along.
Maybe people just prefer to give away bch?
Because people are holding bitcoins, since anybody who has ever sold and not held ends up regretting it. People have learned their lesson. Buy and hold, until the moon.
"You won't be able to get a fully neutral argument here.

Research on the scaling debate.

$0.10 u/tippr"
Bitcoin Cash follows the original design/scaling plan, as Satoshi created it. It upgraded the temporary 1mb limit to 8mb. Bitcoin Core deviated from this plan, and instead made the temporary 1mb limit permanent, which generated network congestion for the last 3 years, which lead to a rise in fees, and made the network unreliable (during peaks, you can never know if your transaction will go through). They also decided to make 0 confirmation transactions unreliable, and added thousands of lines of code for Segwit, which is basically a solution looking for a problem, and adds an enormous technical debt to the project. They claim to protect decentralization, but the result was the opposite. They always said we should be able to run a node in a raspberry pi, but the mempool of unconfirmed transactions grows so much that it doesn't fit in memory. Meanwhile, BCH node runs just fine in a raspberry pi (Core devs claimed anything above 1mb was impossible).
"""Win""???  What's wrong with you, that you want to destroy bitcoin so badly? This is not a war or something, if you prefer bitcoin cash, use it and that's it.  This constant focus on beating bitcoin, almost all of the posts on here are about that.  It's a bit silly."
"Bitcoin (Core) aims to have small blocks and off-chain scaling through the use of side-chains and the Lightning Network. The main argument is that large blocks will make storage and bandwidth costs too high for full nodes and that it will lead to miner centralization. They are completely wrong because storage is insanely cheap compared to mining equipment and Bandwidth is not an issue at all at the moment.

Bitcoin Cash aims to scale on the blockchain, meaning there are no sidechains or ""bitcoin banks"" that you have to give your money to if you want to avoid high fees; everybody can store and send Bitcoin inexpensively. They do this by raising the block-size over-time. They also plan to implement more tech to prevent blocks becoming full, such as Graphene which supposedly can make a 1GB block seem as though it is only 20MB.

As to which one you go for is hard to decide. Bitcoin will be flipped eventually either by Ethereum or Bitcoin Cash but it has so much inertia that it's hard to tell how long that will take."
I'll probably get downvoted but I don't care much so here's my take.    Bitcoin is the original network of computers that run under a certain consensus of rules to process their transactions.  a large portion of the network decided under consensus to split from the original network to create their own that was faster but still based off of the previous network. That new network is bitcoin cash.  The old one is bitcoin.  
"Well, mr_poopybuthole (it’s not often I’ll get a chance to say that), that’s actually a big question. The reality is the market will decide, so it’s insanely complex. 

In my opinion, bitcoin is the better bet, because of the people behind it. If you research objectively, and look at the supporters of each, you’ll understand what I mean. "
"go with the coin that can work.....that will allow hungry children in Africa to buy a loaf of bread and have it by tomorrow...

put any coin on the market to this test.
p.s.
its not one of those..... but its here....now."
I don't know either. Wait on the sidelines in Monero (far technologically superior to Bitcoin or bcash) if you're unsure
Bitcoin Cash enables instant global payments for less than 1 cent, which was the original intent of Bitcoin. Bitcoin transactions are now slow, expensive and unreliable.
Or maybe the same number of donations have been sent, but the BCH donations actually got through.
"It could also be that the majority of donations are small amounts which is unreasonable to do with BTC as the fee would be as much or more than the donation.

For instance let's say an equal number of people are willing to part with $10 for the cause. With BTC fees around $3-5 archive.org only get $5-7 per donation from BTC compared to the nearly full $10 from BCH. That's as much as a 50% difference. And it only gets worse for lower donations."
"the one that will make you more money (bitcoin)
just realize you're in BTC subreddit so everyone here is a bch fanboy nerd
"
"> I am fine with BCH as a spending coin, like LTC and others.

Thos is a currency is meant to be.

>My bitcoin core is my saving account.

it is more problematic.

"
Giving is how you win? You do realize if btc fails so does bch?
Then Archive.org will sell it for BTC so they can get fiat via the exchanges.
I wonder if this is because BCH owners are more generous, or whether it's more that people who had BTC before the fork are more willing to give up their free BCH? I notice a lot of those addresses have only one input. 
Currency that is easy to use gets used! Wow :p
"Since the marketcap of BCH is 0.13 the size of BTC, this means that BCH hodlers are (1/0.13)*2 = 15 times as awesome as cripplecoin hodlers.

Or perhaps their transactions are still not confirmed..?"
Win what? It shouldn’t be a competition. 
"serious question:

can someone explain why this stat isn't a false correlation towards winning? isn't it just as possible that there are more bitcoin holders than bitcoin cash holders, so they decided not to use bitcoin for donation? "
u/tippr 100 bits
BTC donations have been remitted, too. Should arrive eventually... After backlog...
"By astroturfing the subreddit you payed for?

Edit: inb4 banned"
Can we get the breakdown of the fees paid by the BCH donations, and see if the BTC donations were able to be made with the same fee/byte on the BTC chain how much more in donations they would have received?

Uh i think this amount is too small to use as a sample. Unless you quantified the amount of transactions with each. One person may have donated a large amount but done it with bitcoincash
157133
I'm looking to get into bitcoin cash but since bitfinex is closing to the U.S. Idk where to buy bitcoin cash. My question is which U.S. exchange can I buy bitcoin cash at and what is the best iOS wallet to store it in?
Hey! They are generous, its just.. the transactions stuck and they are  waiting for confirmation (give them some ^weeks ^^possible)
If they hit $6000, do you think they'll agree to change all the bitcoin archives to pictures of Ellen Degeneres?
Whys it about winning? Why cant they co-exist?

Sure, whatever you say, mister.
Why does everyone keep doing $0.10 tippr?
North Coreans don't use Bitcoin. All they care about is speculation, not usage. Why do you think they don't care about the backlog and high fees?
"Sorry for the ignorance, but I'm a bit confused:
How does block size relate to the suppression of fees? I think I understand that the reason for the high fees with BTC is because of the competition to be on the block, but if this is true why would a size increase resolve this? Wouldn't it take the same effort to fill up 1 8mb block as filling up 8 1mb blocks?"
"Can you link me to how I could set up a BCH node on raspberry pi? Super interested.

Also, is there an alternative to coinbase that lets me go from fiat to BCH so I don't have to buy btc, send to bittrex, then trade for BCH?"
"Interesting. I’ve seen estimates of bitcoin being at nearly one million by 2020 so are you saying that ethereum and bitcoin cash will be worth even more or that bitcoin will crash?

Also, from everything I’ve been reading it seems I should invest a lot in bitcoin and ethereum but still have a bit in smaller currency. Is that about right?"

the thing to miss is that the comunity of users used to all support bitcoin, the plan Satoshi laid out. A few people took control of the code, didn't allow the change everyone was expecting, and kicked out the previous maintainer of the code.

Monero will have its own scaling challenges, but I agree that it's a very good crypto to bet on.

More likely, most people don't want to spend $7 in fees to donate a few dollars to Archive.org.

BTC is revolution LARPing for technocrats.
"> I don't trust con men to improve BCH over the long term.

How can *all* of the developer groups on an open source project be con men? Roger Ver (I assume he's one you're referring to) doesn't control all development on this platform, or really any at all outside his website/app Bitcoin.com that I know of.

There's at least 5 development teams that I can think of off the top of my head that are working on some kind of new feature or upgrade to Bitcoin Cash. Someone recently posted a list with more than 10, if I remember correctly. This doesn't even account for all the developers we haven't yet heard of working quietly on BCH-compatible apps and other technologies on their own dime. 

You can't possibly tell me all of these people are con men. And don't try to convince me that that hundreds, potentially thousands, of independent developers are Bitcoin Cash shills selling vaporware to inflate this coin's value. While we're at it, let's discuss all of the evidence that the Illuminati are in on this too! 

I don't fault you for using both coins. I just recently started spending Bitcoin Cash and even got my mother interested in the technology by sending her a bit of BCH. I still hold BCore coins in the off-chance that I can make a big payout if the coin hits 15k, 20k, or some other crazy number. Yea, it's my savings account too. But I'm ultimately saving up to buy more Bitcoin Cash, and I think you are too, you just don't realize it yet. ;)"

Personally, I think that the price will keep rising until most people actually know and understand what Bitcoin is, once that market is saturated, something bad will happen and a big market crash will occur... but that's just my theory. Until that happens, I'd give Bitcoin a lifespan of 3-5 more years.
"Not to toot my own horn, but I did. I made this comment about five years ago, I'm recording it here for posterity though it was originally made on /r/bitcoin back in the day. I believe it fits far better here now though.

My apologies to all for the childlike awe that may now be tarnished somewhat by the battles we've endured along the way, but what's a community without reminiscing every now and then.

*------First long form original comment I made as to why I was involved in Bitcoin and where I saw it going follows -----------*

 
A sliding scale of awesomeness;

Level 1) Circumventing payment processors **DONE**

Dependencies;

Bitcoin has a non zero value.

it is useful purely to circumvent payment processors, as a consumer this is a small boon as paypal visa and MC are somewhat annoying to deal with, but as a sometime merchant this is an off the charts enormous boon, as merchant accounts at banks are ridiculously hard to get and ridiculously hard to deal with. Once joe public small business owner figures out he can set up a reliable account as easily as it's possible something like bitpay, and the implications of that, PP/Visa/MC are in some serious shit. This *alone* is worth the price of admission for me but it doesn't account for the next levels where things get seriously awesome.

Level 2) Circumventing Banks and financial services **WELL UNDERWAY**

Dependencies;

Bitcoin has a non zero and not drastically trending downwards on a long term basis value, and that the cryptographic principles underlying the blockchain are sound (which if they weren't, would influence the value to a long term drastic downward trend, so really we could just roll that into the first part of the deps here). 

It is useful to not have to deal with banks and their 9-5 hours and large fees and random assorted ridiculousness that is the result of having a stranglehold on an essential monopoly market for so long that the average participant in the banking indstry's grasp on competition is theoretical at best. That you can hold your own funds almost zero physical footprint and no way for people to even know how much you have, where, or anything of the sort is a revolutionary ability never before available in the history of humanity, it will absolutely change the world when people figure this out.

On other financial services, with bitcoin payment and holdings it is now entirely practical to rely on bonds and insurance to hedge against risks rather than contracts, legislation and litigation. Truly free markets setup around the principles of it being in their best interests to operate in good faith are already springing up and are like to become par for the course when the model is validated over time. Any financial instrument or service that currently exists in the heavily regulated monopoly financial markets could be implemented with bitcoin. 

Hedge funds, investment banks, brokerages, managed funds, stock exchanges, bond markets, all of these things are due for a massive asskicking and I see it coming in a big way.

Level 3) Circumventing central banks and fiat money entirely. **IN PROGRESS**

Dependencies; 

Bitcoin continues to increase in value as the wealth of the world flows into the system and away from fiat currencies.

The entire global financial system at the central bank level is built upon attempting to force profits from a financial underclass that has a mathematically impossible task of repaying debt that continuously increases by definition. The fiat money systems of the world are quicksand by design precisely so on a macroeconomic scale the central banks can force market participants into loose monetary policy by increasing their inflation / monetary instability and making more and more investments look good by comparison. 

When the largest central bank in the entire world has committed to unlimited quantitative easing until the economy moves from its platform, the only sensible way to take this is as final capitulation. They will continue to inflate the money supply until they have people standing on other ground. They expect that the ""other ground"" will be stocks, sovereign bonds, other investments in the markets that they control but with the rise of bitcoin they may be in for a rude shock when their marks decide to entirely circumvent their game and move off fiat money and heavily controlled markets en masse. What we are seeing here may very well be the beginning of that.

Level 4) The euthanasia of the modern nation state. **THEY CAN SEE IT NOW, AND IT SCARES THEM, YOU ARE HERE**

Dependencies;

All of the above and the state proves completely impotent in actually stopping these things from happening.

The tyrants fall, the utterly corrupt modern business model known as the nation state whereby the ""customer"" is effectively just some mark in a given geographic area and all participants in the tax farm system are a cartel of nation states acting in concert to extract the maximum possible from their cattle ceases to exist. The complete inability to control the economy of the world by force leads to the death of the very core concept of the modern nation state; Making your customer's patronage compulsory.

In any argument with a strident statist, they will cede any ground, acknowledge any fact, go to any length at all to divert attention from the core fact that the state extorts its customers. If any other business behaved in the manner that all the states in the world do people would be up in arms and screaming bloody murder on a regular basis; States hold zero responsibility to their customers, the power the customer holds over a business is that if they do not see value in the product delivered they can choose to discontinue their dealings with that business. This is the last and final sanction of incompetence that the state, the final bastion of utter incompetence is completely dependent upon. 

Nobody who has the ability to actually refuse would take the deal the modern nation state offers, this is why they fight so ridiculously hard to prevent it even being an open question. But bitcoin removes the question from the realm of politics and inserts it squarely in the realm of mathematics. The statists can rail and scream and whine and complain all they want, but not a lick of it will change the mathematics of cryptography.

We may destroy the most bloodthirsty thugs the world has ever seen, and we may not even have to shed a single drop of blood to do it. I realise this is hyperbole and I speak only for myself and my opinion, but to me such a worthy goal without compromising at all on principles of non aggression may without exaggeration be the most spectacular accomplishment in all of human history. It is the ultimate manifestation of rejecting that the ends justify the means, going up against the greatest enemy free men have ever faced, and walking straight through him.

So, for me? I'll take any of these four levels, the higher the better. Even one is great, but all four? Nirvana baby.

Only in exceptional unfortunate circumstances when I'm convinced of ongoing maliciousness will I then ignore a poster entirely, but even in those cases it's *still* marginal.

"BCH is a fork of the bitcoin protocol. It's basically an upgrade to be able to confirm much more transactions and never let blocks to be full again. It happens that a bunch of fanatics refused to upgrade which have split the protocol into two separate incompatible version (bitcoin BTC and bitcoin cash BCH). 

The BCH train is not ""early"" per se as it shares the same transaction history then the old version prior the fork but the coins are still quite cheaper than BTC (almost 10 times) as the industry have not yet fully integrated the upgrade.

"This is what I don't understand: Why do you care what Bitcoin does?  What needs debating?  There's an obvious differing in opinions and now the coins have split, why doesn't BCH do their thing and let BTC do theirs? 

If Bitcoin decides to agree with BCH and increase their block-size, this would annihilate any worth that BCH has, so it's not in your interest for the two coins to be the same.

"
I'm a nerd and made the switch I supported BTC since 2010 I just don't see a blocksize increase as a problem since tech keeps improving. Also I think blockstream has too big of a role in the development of bitcoin. I don't see how lightning networks won't be centralized due to the hubs.

"> Avoiding it until it hits $1000 before

> then pretty much showing an attitude of ""you're doing it wrong, kids""?

Haha well, this, certainly! But that's very different from a Professor Bitcorn type figure..."
"> ""More or less skeptical"" is not even the right metric to focus on.

You were the one who brought up Adam Back is (supposedly) a Bitcoin skeptic. Which, I'll just say it at this point, is a LIE. Now you're just trying to weasel out of this, it seems.

If you insist on claiming Adam Back is a Bitcoin skeptic, I'm going to call you a liar and a dishonest person.

> When you say things that are observable facts with easy proofs ""don't make any sense"", it should be a sign to you that you're very likely extremely confused about something.

Observable fact? Excuse me? Tell me how you're going to quantify whether 80% of the online populace believes ""something"" (where the definition of ""something"" is likely a subjective matter open to interpretation) while 20% of the populace believes the opposite however you define it.

**Lies. Damn Lies. And Statistics.**"
"I think the market has already spoken.  While I don't agree that fees are good, there are two different use cases now forming: 1)  Those who want stability, safety and protection for their money away from banks & their low interest rates (use BTC) and 2) Those who want to transact with a crypto.  

In the second case there are literally hundreds of competitors that do it better than BCH (and BTC) but don't have all the underlying baggage.  If I want to transact with crypto, I would put in a nominal amount and then use it as required.  If you are hoping that it will increase several-fold in value at the same time, then there's a  conflicting argument.  Currencies require a stable price for you to transact with it.  An appreciating value will only encourage the ""HODL"" mentality and discourage people from handing it over except for ""significant"" exchanges.

We've been given a glimpse of the future, but forks of Bitcoin just aren't part of it in my opinion.  It is proven to be completely inefficient in terms of power consumption, not decentralized as claimed and constantly subject to attack from miners, developers and the community.  Luckily there are new breeds of crypto that address these problems which is why I think BTC will be the only ultimate surviving Bitcoin strain since it has the most divested interest to make sure it keeps ticking until the next breed takes over. 

"
"> It's blatantly obvious Adam Back is the furthest thing from a ""Bitcoin skeptic"".

Avoiding it until it hits $1000 before then pretty much showing an attitude of ""you're doing it wrong, kids""?

Yes, I call that a Bitcoin skeptic.

Have you read his old BCT threads where he initially appeared in the scene? Oozing of arrogance and 'I know it better'. Disgusting.

Works on many people, though.

Not saying that you in particular fell victim to that kind of tactics, but too many people did indeed."
"> OK then, wise guy: would you say Adam Back is more skeptical or less skeptical of Bitcoin than Professor Bitcorn?

Would you say an islamic imam is more or less skeptical than a dissenting physicist regarding the copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics?

The physicist probably has a far more indepth view of the question than the imam, but they both disagree with the actual interpretation at the end of the day. ""More or less skeptical"" is not even the right metric to focus on.

> Dude. OK. I don't want to discourage your pet theory, but it just doesn't make any sense, and this is getting pretty pointless to debate.

When you say things that are observable facts with easy proofs ""don't make any sense"", it should be a sign to you that you're very likely extremely confused about something."
"I don't particularly support either. What I do support is raising awareness about Bitcoin's flaws. If Bitcoin is going to be the future of money, we need to make it clear that paying $10 for a transaction that could take anywhere between 15 minutes to 2 days is not ""the future."" It's the future for large sums of money, but for everyday use, Bitcoin is not the answer. 

BCH has its advantages over Bitcoin, but it's still not good enough compared to some other coins. I think what BCH needs to do is exactly what you mentioned, dethrone Bitcoin. Not so it can become the new #1 coin with the biggest market cap, but to prove that Bitcoin can be replaced. We can't be narrow minded and refuse to allow another coin to take Bitcoin's place. We need to keep an open mind. We need to encourage better technology, rather than sticking with the inferior one because ""it's the original so it must be better."" And most of all we need to get rid of the idea that competition is bad. Competition is excellent, especially on such a massive scale. It leads to improvements by coins so they don't lose their buyers. And in turn, we as investors get better coins to invest in. The people who profit most will be the consumers. And believe me, nobody will ""consume"" Bitcoin if they need to pay $2 for some food and $10 for network fees. "

OK then, wise guy: would you say Adam Back is more skeptical or less skeptical of Bitcoin than Professor Bitcorn?

It's blatantly obvious Adam Back is the **furthest thing** from a ""Bitcoin skeptic"".

Dude. OK. I don't want to discourage your pet theory, but it just doesn't make any sense, and this is getting pretty pointless to debate."
"I don't think people who support BCH fully understand the implications of Bitcoin ""evolving"". If it eventually does that in the coming months, BCH is completely pointless, isn't it?  

What is BCH innovating to prevent becoming obsolete or is the movement entirely based on dethroning Bitcoin? "
"All along, from the moment Mike Hearn wrote his infamous post highlighting the absurdity of the core position and his response to it, I just couldn't believe that these technically competent people would honestly stick to such a plan. And when I saw them actually trying to defend the idiocy, I thought ""Alright, they may be spinning this tale now, but when push comes to shove and the dominance of their project starts slipping due to their idiocy, they will surely put aside the plan and do the intelligent thing, they're just like me after all and that's what I would do even if I was somehow deluded enough to be spouting the nonsense these people are temporarily""

It's taken me a very long time to come to the realisation of what actually must have happened, and that realisation has made me an even more cynical person than I used to be. We live and learn I guess. Never give people the benefit of the doubt on behaviour that makes no sense because you assume they're just like you. There's probably something stranger going on behind the scenes.

> This would seem to contradict your ""pet theory"":

Not at all. Just because there's an 80/20 split regarding something doesn't mean the 20 are necessarily right. Put two christians in a circle discussing the existence of god with eight atheists and it doesn't suddenly make the christians correct. It is as I said a contributing factor, recall I even used the exact language ""all else being equal"".

It is simply a fact that laypeople observers are largely extremely confused by the technical parameters of the off chain vs on chain scaling debate.

"What I mean when I say ""it's not supposed to be money"" is that in contrast to hard supply limited crypto, the supply is both not limited, and subject to change. I don't mean to imply that's ""nefarious"" or anything, as it makes sense given the application that Ethereum is designed for. But it certainly does make a difference between it and the aforementioned hard supply limited crypto."
Bitcoin needs to evolve. BCH might not even be the answer, but it needs to evolve. 
"Exactly. Blockstream is motivated by profiting of their layer solutions and fees. They profit from a low blocksize limit. Thing is that, if you compare Bitcoin Cash to Bitcoin Core, then sure, you might be the preferred bankers choice as is the case for Bitcoin Core, but if all commerce go to one coin, then all that you are is just a symbol of the oppression if you are the coin that has the with the highest market cap  and the most acceptance by government and general adoption.

Because if the ""the masses"" might pick the coin that costs 1 cent to transfer and has a clear mempool instead of $2-3 transfers and long waiting times, then your choice was one that promoted Bitcoin as store of value and a tool for bankers and not commerce and cheap transfers on a global scale.

I think that technology always wins over politics. So, if Bitcoin Cash on-chain scaling is superior, it will break any institution that is set up against it. So I don't worry a lot, since I'm fairly certain it will happen. The problem is the reassessment of your predictions continuosly. 

But right now, if Bitcoin Core doesn't fix it's issues, Bitcoin Cash would  be chosen for commerce and Bitcoin Core might(?) be looking as use as store of value? Is commerce more important than store of value? I think you should look at the value of the stock market and gold to do that. Answer is obviously commerce. Also, there is nothing that contradicts Bitcoin Cash being that store of value too."
"> Right... You can't circumvent the banks if the banks are the new ""layer 2"". That is clearly the plan. I was naive to ever have imagined they wouldn't fight back and not spotted core's sabotage sooner.

Same here. It is funny how the fog lifted now on their tactics."
"> I find it amusing that you imply he's not skeptical of it still. Look what his company is doing to it, after all.

I'm the *last* person to defend Blockstream's doings, but you surely must be joking. Adam Back, a noted ""Bitcoin skeptic""?

Is this really an honest description of Adam Back?

> Source is just another piece of information to consider

This would seem to contradict your ""pet theory"":

> I have a pet theory that says you can heavily bias your predictions towards a likely result in a given question by looking for that approximate distribution amongst opinion holders."
Seashells, cigarettes and coffee beans aren't supposed to be money either though.
So what's there to debate?  Everyone is happy then, right? 
I mean, if they manage to somehow scale it high enough to compete with traditional credit cards and keep the fees lower, then I see no reason why it shouldn't suceed. But for now, I simply can't imagine it to be around for the long run.
"Right... You can't circumvent the banks if the banks are the new ""layer 2"". That is clearly the plan. I was naive to ever have imagined they wouldn't fight back and not spotted core's sabotage sooner.

A mistake I will not repeat.

> You could say the same about Ethereum, by the way.

I love Ethereum, but it's not supposed to be money.

> Biasing your conclusions based on source has historically been very, very costly for investors, and I'm pretty dumbfounded you'd argue differently.

It all depends really. Source is just another piece of information to consider. If the greatest con man in the world tells me 2 + 2 = 4, it doesn't matter that he's the greatest con man in the world, that's still true. If the buddha himself on the other hand tells me it's 5, once again it doesn't make it any less false.

When things are more fuzzy, the source becomes more of an influencing factor as to the probability one side is or is not lying and/or correct/incorrect."
BTC can't just increase block size, they'd need a hard fork. Considering how one already exists, why would people vote for a new coin when BCH is already here? 
I care about the source of the information.
What if... and it's a big *if*... the layer 2 and 3 solutions Core is building works flawlessly within the next few years? 
"Actually, it is a good thing you reposted it. Since you wrote it 5 years ago, the block size would probably just start to get full at that point. Since we now have Bitcoin Cash that solved that problem in the most efficient way, you could just do a bit of changes and it would apply right now from this point onward.

""Level 3"" is what Bitcoin Core tried to do. Off-chain scaling opens up to third parties with influence. They delayed it for years, but now it is really going to start to take off."

"Remember, even cryptographers like *Adam Back* were skeptical of the idea of Bitcoin at first. I'm referring to the year 2010, and those making $10k predictions back then certainly weren't ""opinion leaders"".

Biasing your conclusions based on source has historically been very, very costly for investors, and I'm pretty dumbfounded you'd argue differently."
Ah, I didn't get the joke. My bad! 
"We'd rather be welcoming to all new users.

BTC users had a thread (a few days back) worrying about the impact if Amazon should start using their coin... and it was apparent that their only scaling choice is LN.  I'm hoping it shocked some into seeing the big block vision.  This video shows what can be done today, pretty easily."
Right of course, my point is you and me are not above or below those very smart people (...though I tip them all the time due to them working much harder than I do). We're all in this together.

He should invest in BTC because it isnt cool. Its basically a ponzi and crippled and AOL
he forgot about mojang...
BCH is cool though...
Is that Alex from Target?

Golden logic, can’t argue with that i guess
Contrarianism is a lifestyle. And highly profitable when done right.
Those core trolls are getting more idiotic by the day.... Those comments on Twitter are so ridiculous! Just plain insults with no facts, no discussions, nothing smart.... Just attacks. We must really be doing something good if they act this way!
People confused between btc and bch should go through his twitter timeline. He makes some really good arguments in favor of bch.
Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin in 2013 when the blocks started to come full, but with the block size raised.
This guy invests 
"Hmm. The only difference here is in 2013-2014 NO crypto was cool. They were all thought of as a bubble. 2017 is now the year of big investors waking up an investing in different coins other than just BTC. It's much smarter to diversify as there really wont be one cool coin.  

So to say BTC wasn't cool back then is really referring to all crypto. I have about 20% of my portfolio in BCH. There are a lot of non-cool coins that will take off other than just BCH. I mean look at Dash, big gains."
You know what else isn't cool?  Twitter.
Hey Alex, BCH is cool as fuck.
btc was cool in 2013
Same.
But...are you selling your BTC?
also, what's the upside with btc over bch? Say btc doubles in the next year and goes to 20k. Do you really think it will 10x like last year? Really? You think each coin will be work 100k? Really? Okay, maybe sure. But if btc goes that high, what do you think the chances of bch tagging along for the ride are? What do you think the chances of bch doubling are? It just seems likely that it will double at least. Hell, if you got in at 300 you have already made more than the people who hodled btc.
"I'm with him. I've been an ETH junkie for a long time but I really like the /r/btc community and BCH and i'm definitely putting some money in BCH. 

BTC is a loser for me."
Lol, funny to read posts like this, so many peoples care about fees.😂 I bet 99% bought and hold in anticipation of price rise not making a single transaction per month.
Brings a tear to my eyes. Protip: We stuck with [our mission](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/772fna/in_these_interesting_times_lets_review_a_little/) back then and it worked. Now that Satoshi's Bitcoin is under assault again, stick to the mission, and it'll pay off. Spend and rebuy, push for adoption, start businesses. 
Hmm I can agree to this. But people here treat BCH as something which is already cool.
You don't get rich following the masses. You have to be ahead, and look to the fundamentals. 
For the last fucking time, the past tense of HODL is HEDL. 
I like BCH and where its headed. It’s like we finally got back on the path bitcoin was headed before core developers purposely led it in the wrong direction. 
In life you have pioneers, and you have followers.  It takes guts to be a pioneer, you have to go against the crowd. 
Yarp... Same boat. No more legacy here.
I find BCH pretty cool TBH.
Who the fuck is Alex?
He speaks my language
"Is he a big name? Not many followers...

Going all in on bitcoin gold then. See you all on Pluto. 
Because we can relate. He's speaking for many of us.
"We're dealing with developers that are trying to fit bitcoin into the traditional financial system, that's why it's getting lots of hype. The problem is bitcoin cannot work that way. They're changing the fundamentals which is damaging the economic incentives of each participant in the network.

BTC was doing fine until developers paid off by companies like MasterCard got involved. It's not surprising, a product that reaches mainstream will usually get refined to appeal to the masses. But these guys just have no clue what they're getting into, and it's apparent."
"This.  If BCH was so revolutionary, it wouldn't need to be hammered onto people in the way it is.  Instead, it just tries to piggyback off the Bitcoin name and sets up conflict by saying Bitcoin is tainted due to developers, big banks, Tether, you name it.  It really shows that there is little else to promote. . 

From an investors point of view they are both pretty much old, inefficient technology now.  Bitcoin however is a better bet because it has stood the test of time and  is not in the hands of only a few large investors and miners who can manipulate the price. "
Do it! Buy the dip!
Big ideas and true stories don’t need big names 
and who are you?
"remains to be seen

I'll bet we see $10,000 BCH before we ever see a working Lightning Network."
Welcome to the Shillstream era.
Yeah indeed. People look at btc price only and believe they made the best choice by sticking with btc. But most of those core shills fail to realize you could've had 6-7x more coins with bch. Btc doubled while bch quadrupled in 3 months. And still they laugh at us who sold btc for bch.....
Indeed! If you reach for the stars you'll at least reach the moon!
True, the only transaction I made this year was literally just sending crypto to Exodus wallet and now all to my Ledger Nano S.
But didnt people do that too in Bitcoin forums in 2013? And kept getting harassed by anti-bitcoin trolls? Seems pretty similar to me today
"We're a minority by far. 

It's interesting actually, if you're familiar with the pareto principle I have a pet theory that says you can heavily bias your predictions towards a likely result in a given question by looking for that approximate distribution amongst opinion holders. 

All else being equal, if it appears about 80 percent of people are flatly wrong about something laypeople would find complex, and about 20 percent of people all grasp it quite firmly and make the same mathematically valid arguments in support of the position, the distribution itself can be used as contributing additional evidence that the 20 percent are probably correct.

The ratio between /r/btc and /r/Bitcoin pretty closely matches that distribution, diverging by only about an extra twenty percent, and in addition on a recent survey of opinions held by subscribers, about twenty percent of /r/btc subscribers were anti BCH, making the ratio fit even more neatly into place. In fact in a great many places within this debate that apparent 80/20 split keeps popping up.

Interesting stuff. "

What’s the deal with this TBH? Is it a new ico? How can I get in on it??? I missed the boat on btc so I really need to get on the tbh train early to be honest
It's cool for those who understand the technology and its future, not for everybody else. Same as Bitcoin was a few years ago. And same reason why I'm heavily into BCH.
[deleted]
Except for the fact that BCH is tremendously cool. He's the cool version of the uncool BTC. 
Who is he? 
good luck lol. ill trust the nerds with my money. not the bullies that bullied the nerds.

Who gives a shit what some random Twitter user says. Why is this getting upvoted?
I started before him and prefer Bitcoin. We are each just one person. Let the market decide.
Hang on we aren't the cool kids!!!!
"I’m sorry, but past performance is not indicative of future results. These people that made out well in BTC are just looking for the same experience (even trying to manufacture it, like Ver and team) via a mechanism that worked once for them, but the market conditions are not even remotely similar. There are going to be some seriously disillusioned people when they lose all those profits in the crash.

And it is coming. All bubbles pop, and the vast majority of these “geniuses” will lose it all because they believe so strongly in “hodl” when things are tolerable, but panic out at bottoms when shit gets really ugly.

Just look at all bubbles past, same dynamics: people made a ton on the way up, get over-invested and levered into the euphoria or side schemes hoping to replicate the results based on false correlations, only to have it all come crashing down on them."
"I see the point he’s trying to make but his argument just really doesn’t make any sense, crypto wasn’t nearly as big as it is now and maybe bch has a nice concept but there marketing just throws me off. Maybe they have a vision, an idea, or a plan, but this idea of marketing btrash as “the real bitcoin” is a disgrace to the crypto world. The random pump and dumps, the“bitcoin” wallet on the App Store,  and overall claiming BCH to be the real BTC is disgusting.

Now I’m not a bitcoin advocate like I’m well aware that it’s terrible but there are several other alternatives that one could use opposed to BTC/BCH but i think people need to accept that Bitcoin Cash will *NEVER* be Bitcoin. Maybe they would see more success if instead of trying to claim BCH as BTC and pitched their vision and plan instead.

"> Bitcoin was always supposed to scale on-chain by just removing the temporary small block size limit.

and:

> ... the Bitcoin white paper it's built upon.

and:

> ... Bitcoin Core Dev. team hijacked Satoshi's invention ... the defining white paper

Those statements are examples of ideology. ""Always supposed to"", ""deviation from originality"", ""hijacked <insert deity> <insert idea>"" are all examples of ideological non-arguments. I mean, MySpace did social media one way, does that mean Facebook did it wrong? I know, bad example for many reasons, but I'm sure you understand what I'm trying to say.

Look, you're not wrong. Not at all. And I agree with you (I think - I'm confused by many things from time to time with regards to technical issues beyond my comprehension). But I'm also allergic to non-arguments based on ideology. Instead of saying ""we should follow the whitepaper!"" as some sort of deity, the argument should be ""we should follow this idea in the whitepaper because the problem has already been solved theoretically, let's put that into practice"".

Points aren't being made, but rather the community is resorting to throwing shit at each other and shouting ""Nah uh! YOU are the baddy!""

Sad thing is, proponents of both chains have valid points. I'm not opposed to off-chain scaling, unless that off-chain chain (?) is owned by someone and not by everyone. Not because of ideology, but because of checks and balances, mind you.

Am I making sense?"
thanks, that would make sense. I was sending it to my own bitcoin cash address on my ledger wallet but maybe I screwed something up related to that.
