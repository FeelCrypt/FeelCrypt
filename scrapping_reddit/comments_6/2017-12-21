SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY"
LOOOL They drop this without preannouncement during this bull run? Pump will be mad...
"Damn, I wanted to get in before they added it.

I was under the impression it wasn't supposed to be added until Jan.

I'm going to lose sleep thinking about those lost gains =("
"It's finally official.

And even available immediately."
> Sends and receives are available immediately. Buys and sells will be available to all customers once there is sufficient liquidity on GDAX. We anticipate that this will take a few hours.
"#Immediately available!

Congratulations to everyone for pushing for positive change. 
holy shit
Absolutely remarkable growth thus far. Congratulations to the Bitcoin community, and thank you Coinbase!
Bitcoin Cash is the manifestation of the Honey Badger.  Congratulations everybody, every single member of this community played a part and its only the beginning.  We can finally build and transact normally again.  Common sense has come back to rule the day.  Bitcoin Cash is the true Bitcoin! /u/tippr gild
"Just want to point out something funny, /r/bitcoin is celebrating that Coinbase users can finally dump their ""bcash"", and are saying that the price is going **up** because of all the Coinbase users **selling** their ""shitcoins"". This is the economic illiteracy we're up against."
Omg what is going on with bitcoin cash!! I'm seeing it for $8,500 wtf?!?!?
"OMG OMG. Don't know what to say. I don't even know why I'm so happy!

Breath...

Eyes on the prize: adoption adoption adoption.

This is gentlemen. Look at that green dildo on the chart hahahaha
#BCH BCH BCH BCH BCH BCH BCH
Did anyone see that huge spike to .28 on Bittrex? It dropped back down to .17 now it's up to .22 as I write this. Whaaaaaaaa this is insane!
Time to go on a tipping spree in the wider reddit?
oh man...so glad i bought some when the api was leaked. It's a pleasure to be part of the flippening guys
"Buy. Announce. Sell.

This is gentlemen.

"The flippening will start.

To. The. Moon."
Can anyone buy yet?! Doesn't seem ready. Any idea what happened at 6:40-6:45pm?
"Man I've just got one lonely BCH but it's about to get 6 confirmations and loaded into Coinbase.  Hoping I can sell tonight and buy back after a correction.

Whatever happens, one thing is inevitable...

I'M GETTING DRUNK TONIGHT.  FUCK SHOWING UP TO WORK ON TIME TOMORROW.  LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOoooooooooooo"
ELI5 bitcoin cash please
why does it say bitcoin cash purchases are temporarily disabled?
Great now everyone will dump this sh...3k??? Wait that one isn't on my core manual, instructions unclear, flippening happening.
SOMEONE HODL ME
BOOOOOOM. Yuz yuz. 
To the frontpage!
OMG YES!!! Thank you Coinbase!
Just paused my bitcoin autobuy. Time to start a BCH autobuy.
"Anyone else’s Coinbase freaking out!;"
"fck yea! /u/tippr gild

Coinbase, I counted on you and I wasn't disappointed! You guys were fighting the good fight since day one (well you had charlie lee on board but.. noone is perfect ;) )"
[deleted]
Who else bought in at 5300? 
Note to self: Buy the currency before Coinbase starts selling it 😜
"Hell yeah!! 

This is huge! "
Glad they did this. Finally I can buy some BCH.
"YES!!!!!!

""Sends and receives are available immediately.""

YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES!!

~~BITCONEEEEEEEEEEEECT~~ BITCOINCAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASH!!!"
BITCOIN IS BACK!
Congrats to all that made this happen at Coinbase and the BCH ecosystem at large.
I pleased that a real digital currency will now be available to customers frustrated with bitcoin core
Man am I glad I bought at under 2k. I even paid a ridiculous fee because I used my debit card and I don't care. 
LOL I was just finishing a trade on GDAX from BTC to ETH so I can then buy Bitcoin Cash on another exchange, and when I go back to Coinbase to check my balances this announcement hits me out of the blue... well, back to GDAX again
Holly ......
BAM!
Hmmm won’t let me buy BCH. Wonder when I will be able to?
"**HELL YEAHHHHHH!!!!**

https://imgur.com/J0peurI.gifv"
any idea how long before they enable purchases? 
WHATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT THE PRICE HAS GONE THROUGH THE ROOF WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO THANK YOU GUYS 
"Anyone else remember thinking ""gee, I don't know if I should buy any more"" back ~$320?"
Wow, I know they said it would happen in 2017 but I didn’t expect it suddenly like this. 
Coinbase says bch is 8k right now.  Lol
"Sooooo..... is anyone selling on Coinbase @ $8,500?

It's gotta come down....right???"
"All BCH books will enter cancel-only mode, and all existing orders will be cleared. While in cancel-only mode, no new orders will be accepted. We will post an update shortly. 

wth does this mean?"
Is the dump already starting? Huge selloffs on everywhere but bithumb
It’s currently $0.00, NOW IS THE TIME TO BUY!
These comments are proof that some people who like bch are just doing it for the money lol

"Happening status?  it's

Holy shit - this killed the site.  GG.
BITCOIN CASH NED, ON AN OPEN FIELD!!!
WHY THE TEASE, SHITBASE? My portfolio just got fucked by these antics. 
"There are a lot of Bitcoin Core supporters who all of a sudden are holding bags of BCH, and right about now are having a real soul searching moment: ""should I listen to r/bitcoin or the markets?"""
wew, this is how regulations happen

"RIP the poor souls who brought Bitcoin cash at 9.5k thinking it is Bitcoin.....


GGS"
The insider trading is strong with this one 
Annnd it's gone. This is why we can't have nice things!
Wow. This is big. 
BOOM!
Oh my. Someone hold me. 
Wow, I seriously thought Segwit would happen first, just to stay face to the BTC community. This is amazing!
Pity that the orange is not doing well during the flippening. I hope it comes back once the segwit1mb fork dies off.
Damn!  Looks like you guys have caused coinbase to go down again!  :)
"There were some haters saying they could only withdraw bitcoin cash. Glad to see you can buy bitcoin cash! Awesome :) 

There is also rumors of coinbase adding monero and eos in 2018 which is good to see"
annnnnd we broke GDAX already
Can someone tell me what’s happening? I saw it go from 4000 to 1700 in a minute. Now I can figure out the price
[deleted]
Is my app bugging out or did BCH go up by 5k in the last hour? 
Coinbase showing 8500.00 for me someone slap me with a tip
What crazy times to be alive, so many vertical graphs... My heart goes to all who fell for the BS sabotage operation.
I'm so happy about this! We finally did it! Despite all the bashing on BCH in my country's main crypto Telegram chat, I ignored the noise and held on to what I believe in. Here we go! Bitcoin Cash! 
Going to be sick with this much movement. Holy smokes.
I bought on gdax during the 3 minutes it was up. It says that I bought at 5250, but apparently it never even hit that high, as it's showing 3100 on other sites atm. Will it correct? 
"Uh, I don't have any BCH in my Coinbase account. It says you had to have BitCoin on August 1, 2017. I don't know if I did--I possibly sold my balance by that date. But I had BTC before and after that date.

You had to have it explicitly on that date? I haven't kept up with any of this so I don't know. I thought the BTC blockchain was copied, but I guess that means it was only copied at one instance, and isn't a running copy? "
Only buy, send, and receive if you’re in Canada.
Why didn't they announce this in advance? Like in the [roadmap](https://mobile.twitter.com/Andrea_Dispe/status/943330470552485888) they released just a few days ago? And why did they push a production update at like 5pm??? This has so many things about it that scream scam to me. I'm extremely suspicious. A crash is coming.
"Sooo... this is why I woke up to a couple thousand more...

Good... good...

Any idea why BTC is going down? *wink* *wink*

Edit: ok... after all this time I just learnt how to format text in Reddit. "
"but now the period of high volatility
"
who's counting down till bch is available for trading on gdax?
"Sell options were disabled from the get go, right, but buys were allowed?

I enjoy the pump, but I'm really hesitant about what's going to happen when sell is enabled. 

Unless it's been enabled already. Then .... well, that's pretty neat, then. Can someone clue me in?"
Except you can’t buy or sell. 👌 nice. 
[deleted]
Holy shit, this is insane.... I'm not one for memes but buy buy buy!
"did i just lose a ton of money? now that bitcoin cash came back to reality?
"
"I don't understand... in under an hour, GDAX BCH price went from $3K to 9.5K... Meanwhile, the platform is hobbling along, totally unusable. I don't know what's going on. Is this a glitch? What are all the orders I'm seeing right now above $8K.

[Glitch](https://imgur.com/a/GSIRO)?

"their are over 10000 order to sell and like 100 to buy on gdax.  ... you can see many more sellers than buyers.   

....
...

get ready to buy cheap bitcoin cash... will be last chance to buy cheap"
"Congrats everyone! You’ve now fucked up crypto currency mainstream adoption. Your silly “feud” between btc and bch is going to cost everyone money. 
New money is about to flee en masse. 
New crypto users will see this silly feud and step back from the table.
You’ve attracted the authorities with your insider trading.
Your greed has destroyed something that could have changed the world. 
"
Guys, you're literally all about to lose most your holdings and your cheering.
I just checked the app and I got 0.00000005 BCH lol! 
"""Bitcoin Cash sales are temporarily disabled.""

Sweet, Coinbase!"
Anyone having trouble sending BCH from Coinbase? My transaction was 2.5 hours ago and zero confirmations
#BOOM 
"I'm new to this but when i opened my Coinbase app this morning i suddenly had 38.78 in Bcash, is that a bug?

Edit: Thanks for the replies everyone, looked up a video on Bcash and understand it a bit better now."
nice scam
I just came
"Color me shocked!! YOU GUYS CAME THROUGH!!

Dudes. I literally just sold all my BTC for BCH about 2 hours ago.  This could not come at a better time!

I LOVE YOU COINBASE!! :)

"Holy shit! Coinbase out of left fucking field with a mic drop. I thought it was a joke when I read it on Ethtrader just now until I logged into see a BCH wallet

To the moon!"
Oh. My. God. 
So what does this mean for the price and future of BTC?
I WAS JUST ABOUT TO POST THIS! FOUND OUT LITERALLY NOW
GG

Wow. Beautiful. Just... what a moment. 
ITS HAPPENING
BCH hit $6700 CAD at one point.... wow
Holy shit it's happening!
"Yeah. I swear I had btc in before the fork. Sold after.  Was told I would have cash avail too even if btc was empty.  

No Bitcoin cash.  Odd.  

Edit.   Nope. Was in bread.  It’s back in bread.   "
Does bitcoin stored on GDAX count towards this?
This has been a wild hour.
[deleted]
Bitcoin Cash at $9500 on gdax??? Is this truly the price or some sort of glitch??
"So I bought my bitcoin on July 29. The transaction time took a few days, I received it in my account on Aug 4. 

Anyone know if I'll receive BTC cash since I purchased it before August 1? Or am I shit outta luck? It's not showing up in my account. "
Well shut me up!
Till they try and charge you close to __90percent__ to transfer your BTC 
[Merry Christmas!](https://youtu.be/eBa2Mm-nP50?t=14s)
Everyone that was holding bitcoin on coinbase during the fork just got access to their bch.  More coins will now hit the market. I would think bch price will fall from this, but I guess we will see. 
[for those of you who have no idea what this is](https://support.coinbase.com/customer/portal/articles/2911542-bitcoin-cash-faq)
Looks bullish to me.
"I would love to but I can't fucking get my identity verified no matter how many perfect pictures I take of my US drivers license and their support is worthless. ""Please try again, sorry you're having trouble""."
Misread that at first. Thought we'd finally be able to sell here in Canada.
ITS HAPPENING
Coinbase is not a safe option for people who want to remain anonymous. imo
For somebody who knows nothing about cryptocurrency, what is the difference between bitcoin and bitcoin cash?
What is bitcoin cash? Is it different? 
Yeah but it takes weeks to get money into coinbase
Think I’m gonna get an investment into BCH now aswell! To the moon
/u/tippr for president!
"mfw when I suddenly got a bunch of BCH because I was holding BTC at the time of the fork

Well let's test how well tippr works"
In theory.... 
Coinbase, where is my money, it straight up disappeared ok your platform! 10k!
"Can I use Coinbase in Germany?

It says it is not supported. But I have heard of people having used it in the past"
Care to explain for someone from r/all?
According to Bloomberg coin base will start trading again at 9am Pacific time
I'm a cryptocoin newb. Is buying and selling going to be pretty straightforward?
Guys please tell me BTC will go down again when bcash resumes coinbase trading. 
With crypto ... should I buy at a low price or a high price? When I see a high price, I think I should buy as it's going up... but then when it drops, I realise I get more for less but then I'm scared if it crashes ...
If GDAX and Coinbase trading of Bitcoin Cash is disabled, why is the price still going up and down in their app? In the last hour, as at 10:55 am EST it says its up $20.87 CAD...
"Anybody scared what is going to happen once GDAX enables BCC trading? 
Thinking of transferring it to Bittrex .
"
The sales have resumed, at least at GDAX. They went live at 11am pst
I send my bitcoin funds from binance to bitcoin cash on coinbase but the funds no show up. I lost my money?
So it was trading last night at 9,500 it crashed and is at 3,700 how is it in the green? And why is there no evidence of this on the graphs. Think they should halt all trading on Bitcoin cash until this huge hiccup is taken care of. People need to research before they buy.
Well that is a big news for Bitcoin Cash but I mean who didn't see this coming?
"Since Coinbase currently disabled BCH buying could I then do this:

- Deposit USD on Coinbase

- Send to GDAX

- Set a limit order and buy BTC

- Use Shapeshift to BCH

- ???

- HODL"
"Is it correct that you still can't trade BCH on CoinBase? If so, is there an ETA for when this will happen?

Can't seem to find anything on their Twitter and the subreddit is a shit-show ATM."
"I received BCH from Coinbase because I had BTC stored there on Aug 1st. There may be millions of customers like me who got ""free money"" (correct me if I'm wrong).

How does Coinbase back this with fiat?"

"Bitcoin Cash is the the most authentic version of Bitcoin to what Satoshi envisioned in 2008. 

I will never forget the negligence that Bitcoin Core's developers forced onto this community in their process of making Bitcoin unusable."
Congrats to everyone who made some good money just now. It’s always good to see people make money. Especially the underdogs. Hats off to BCH
ATTN: If you go into the CoinBase app, select BCH, and click on the end of the graph (current time). The correct current price will show, which happens to be $3,108.01 at the time of this post (6:45PM AZ).
Damn, Ver was right. I think in his AMA yesterday, when asked if Coinbase will support it in 2018, he said they will support it in 2017.
Hello balance my old friend.
I'm from popular. What does this mean to us?
Thanks for all of you guys who worked so hard for BCH, devs, businesses, community 🚀
I dont understand wtf is going on? Can someone explain? What is Bitcoin Cash & How does it compare to regular Bitcoin?
prepare for pump & dump bch xdd
"Are they gonna let people buy this shit or what? This is a joke. The price of BCH continues to rise, meanwhile nobody can purchase on coinbase.

What a fucked up scenario."
Remember in November when this same thing happened?  Its going to happen again when everyone dumps there bcash and you guys are holding bags.
SELL BCASH !
I feel so lucky. Went all in BCH last week believing in the better fundamentals, and now I'm up $150. FeelsGoodMan
<> 
It’s down $5300 this hour
Congratulations Bitcoin Cash, I hope this will be the Bitcoin killer, since Bitcoin has been hijacked by Blockstream and banks. 
I just came back from work and because I wanted to have a good laugh, first thing I did is I went to read r/bitcoin.  Jesus I should have invested in Salt futures, it's fucking hilarious how batshit insanely delusional and salty people are over there. :)
