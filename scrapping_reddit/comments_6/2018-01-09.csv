"Extremely late reply, but I took you up on that offer to see what /rbitcoin has to say. I am posting this reply here in case anyone stumbles upon it. If anyone finds this then do our own research and I'm sure you will come to a reasonable conclusion. Below is a dm I sent to this user - a recollection of the things I've learned since a month ago:

>You probably don't remember, but we had a little conversation here:

>https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7eil12/evidence_that_the_mods_of_rbitcoin_may_have_been/dq7vyqe/

>I'm not sure the exact place our conversation ended but it sparked in me a journey to learn more about the underworkings of Bitcoin. As a result, I have come to the conclusion that both BitcoinCore and BitcoinCash have a place here. I no longer feel that Core is intentionally hurting Bitcoin but rather that their dreams are harder to realize than previously thought. Seeing how we have so many centralized/premined currencies actually doing well I see the danger of a future with establishment taking control of Crypto. As a result I see the usefulness and requirement of Core's need to stay decentralized AND scale well. I know we have offchain ideas which may be monetized but i leaves the ability to stay decentralized and possible scaling improvements down the road.

>I also think that Cash is being led by people who truly believed in a p2p, fast, (insert all other adjectives of crypto), currency for the masses. Core just didn't work out and had to split.

>Maybe I'm just looking at the best possible scenario without human greed and stuff but it makes sense to me.

>I am still learning more about Bitcoin but seeing as how we have other incredible ideas among us in the form of potential altcoins I am not sure if I will ever feel like I have done enough research. I only started looking up Iota last night, and the idea behind Tangle (as opposed to Blockchain) is mind blowing.

>Anyways, it's getting long now. Just wanted to thank you for not dismissing me back then and having a legit conversation despite differences in belief.

>If you give me a BitcoinCash address then Ill be glad to buy you a drink. (no, this isn't a jab at mempool/fees)."
And slowly dropping since. 
How do I know anyone is actually monitoring my channel though?
"Lightning White paper, 2015:

> The bitcoin protocol can **encompass the global financial transaction volume in all electronic payment systems today**, without a singlecustodial third party holding funds or requiring participants to haveanything more than a computer using a broadband connection.

Lightning Network apologist, 2018:

> Even 3 transactions per channel is a win

We held up scaling and fucked up the community based on the first quoted promise. And now you're ok with peanuts.

And no, one additional transaction moved offchain is absolutely not worth any of this.  Fuck."
"Trades made on exchanges do not get confirmed on the blockchain.

Literally every single one of the 358,520 transactions in the last 24 hours were transfers from one bitcoin wallet to another bitcoin wallet. That's literally exactly what that number is measuring, and nothing else.

Anything which is being used is by definition not useless, even if used only once. Is bitcoin accepted by at least one merchant? Is the bitcoin blockchain currently being used?"
"You completely misunderstood me.

What I'm saying is that because channels need an opening and a closing transaction, it makes no sense to open a channel to make a single transaction or two, as that would be more expensive and add bloat to the chain. 

But if you use the channel for 3 or more transactions you'll be saving fees and freeing some on-chain capacity.

In no way did I imply that channels should only be used for 3 transactions each.

By the way, I think the quote you took from the whitepaper is wildly optimistic and the reality won't be even close. 

But that doesn't mean LN won't be useful, it will and I'm very excited for it, it's just not the best option for all use-cases, it has it's own set of disadvantages which will make it better for some use cases but not others. "

"So I was wrong to say it was useless, I should have really just said its getting more useless? Or are we back to pretending that you can't say something is more or less useful its just a binary state?

Here's the line that started this whole line of discussion:

>Just saying ""but lightning"" **whilst letting bitcoin become unusable** is not adapting to anything.

""letting bitcoin become unusable"" is not the same thing as bitcoin already being completely unusable, although you could just ignore that's what I said and focus on the times I called it unusable as a shorthand because its quicker than writing out ""becoming unusable"" every time. After all what I actually mean is less important to the discussion than what you say I mean.

You can also continue to pretend that usability is binary and that either bitcoin is useful or useless and you can't describe a 40% reduction in the number of top 500 US retailers accepting bitcoin related payments as bitcoin becoming less useful.

I'm not sure what you'll get out of that but you're clearly getting something out of it so do continue.

>You understand that your own source disproves your assertion that it is “useless” as a payment method with merchants, right?

0 of those places actually accept bitcoin.

They accept a service like Bitpay that transfers fiat, not bitcoin.

Course you won't even accept that a 40% reduction in top 500 merchant acceptance is getting less useful so I don't expect you to be able to make the distinction between paying in fiat after selling bitcoin to a 3rd party and bitcoin."

>However Lightning is not just a technology in the abstract, but is a highly political, divisive, oversold, underdelivered technology that has been used as a carrot and stick to successfully divide and destroy the community.

>Had the authors of that masturbatory white paper been properly taken to task then this issue would have been settled in early 2016. Instead, the community was prevented from getting real peer review.

Agreed. It's very hard to find good places to discuss the technology itself, it's all either price memes, personal attacks and ""curated"" content (either by the mods or via downvotes. The first one is worse, of course, but the second one also leads to an echo chamber).

>Lightning is easily the most toxic idea to be foisted on this community with its highly dishonest white paper that promised the moon and the sun with no proof of concept whatsoever. It cannot be divorced from its history.

">There is no system of monitors for LN like the system of incentives that keeps miners honest.

The incentive for monitors is the reward they get if they catch someone cheating you, which comes from the penalty applied to the cheater.

What attack is that? The network was free to choose Bitcoin Unlimited months ago, it didn't. The network wasn't attacked by segwit, it chose it over the alternatives.

>The fact that the solution had to be forced instead of pulled

How was it forced, exactly? Can you give an example of a single person who was forced to run the Core client instead of another?

If you mean manipulated, maybe, it depends on how informed miners and node administrators are about what is going on (I assume they're quite well informed), but forced is a very strong word that I don't think applies here. "

">Is bitcoin accepted by at least one merchant?

It's being used by less merchants now than it was 4 years ago, which is why I said its becoming useless. Is usefulness a binary state? Or is it possible for something to be more or less without it being absolutely one thing or another?

>Anything which is being used is by definition not useless, even if used only once.

I already acknowledged bitcoin is useful for speculation, I don't know why you keep pretending that I'm not specifically talking about use of currency, and like there's no difference between the two concepts. There's just ""usefulness"" and its impossible to be any more specific than that.

>Trades made on exchanges do not get confirmed on the blockchain.

How do you think people buy/sell bitcoins and get them transferred to a wallet/address?

Every exchange just has every possible amount of bitcoin sitting in a wallet and hands you the keys to them? How did the right amount of bitcoin get into the wallet in the first place without a blockchain transaction?

It's all off chain? What would even be the point of using the blockchain is you can securely transfer millions in bitcoin without transferring on blockchain? That just means you're paying higher fees. High fees and times have decreased the number of merchants accepting bitcoin, but not the number of people using them to buy goods and services? That's why daily transactions are still going up?

$20 fee and 12 hour wait would be crippling for actual purchases of goods and services. It's only viable if you're buying/selling thousands of dollars of bitcoin in which case its only a small percentage and you don't mind if it takes a couple days to confirm.


>Literally every single one of the 358,520 transactions in the last 24 hours were transfers from one bitcoin wallet to another bitcoin wallet

Definitely not people just buying and selling on fiat though. Even though 99% of anyone talking about bitcoin is just talking about how much they're going to buy and sell for fiat, all these transactions are somehow for goods and services its just not measurable in any way."

">Not being accepted by merchants does not equal not being used at all. You wouldn't say that gold is useless because merchants don't accept it. 

It's useless as a currency. Try going into a store with a gold coin or certificate and buy something with it. It doesn't matter how much you talk about ""but its a great store of value! why would you want dollars that just go down in value?"", no one wants to spend gold coins which means no one is interested in accepting them. The majority of demand for gold comes from the jewelry and electronics industry. The idea its valuable just because its a ""store of value"" is a myth. Platinum is far rarer than gold, but its less valuable because far less people want platinum jewelry than gold jewelry so the fact its rarer doesn't mean shit. 

The fact that billions of dollars of gold are traded every day does not make it a useful currency. How much gold is traded is completely separate from how useful it is as a currency.

>Can you show us these metrics?

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-12/bitcoin-acceptance-among-retailers-is-low-and-getting-lower

In 2014, 5 out of the top 500 US retailers accepted a form of bitcoin payment (none actually accepted bitcoin, they accepted things like BitPay which transfer fiat, not bitcoin, but lets ignore that for now), today its 3 out of the top 500 retailers.

You can google black markets yourself and see how few are still using bitcoin and how many have switched to other cryptocurrencies.

>Not being accepted by merchants does not equal not being used at all.

How do you think increased transactions are a result of more people using bitcoin to buy goods and services if the number of merchants accepting bitcoin for goods and services is decreasing? Do you think more and more people are just shopping at fewer and fewer stores? If there's such demand for buying things with bitcoin why is the number of merchants accepting it decreasing instead of increasing? Do they just hate making money?

>You wouldn't say that cheeseburgers are useless because merchants don't accept it

I'd say they're useless as a currency, because no one wants to accept a cheeseburger as currency. If you want to talk about how useful it is as food, that's a separate discussion.

>A currency settles debts. Period. That's what it is.

You can settle debts in things other than currency. If you have no money, debt collectors will accept goods and assets instead.

You've already identified what currency use looks like (buying an apple with a dogecoin), I don't know why you keep trying to define it as something that is not specific to currency. You can burn money, does that mean anything you can burn is also money?

That you have to ask tells me everything.
">  In order for a payment to be able to flow, all hops must be online at that moment, and all channels along those hops must have sufficient funds in an arrangement which will allow said payment.

Yeah, I know the history, but what parts are you claiming to be an attack?

I sort of agree that the censorship by Theymos on r/bitcoin can be considered an attack. But even if it's done with malice (I don't think it is, I think he's just very biased with his moderation and considers lots of stuff to be trolling) it's quite a minor attack, there are plenty of alternative places to discuss not controlled by him (such as r/btc). 

But Blockstream hiring people to work on a FOSS project isn't an attack. I mean, what would the attack even be if anyone can fork the code? If people don't use alternative clients (and we're talking about the Core client, which isn't used by non-technical users) that's their decision
And you can't force people to work on what you want. If Bitcoin can't survive that, it has no hope.

Both false.

LN introduces significant counterparty risk not present in onchain Bitcoin.  I've explained this elsewhere in this thread.  It also will significantly reduce fees from the base layer.   It's not even certain that the price of Bitcoin stored in Lightning channels will remain coupled to the price of onchain Bitcoin."
