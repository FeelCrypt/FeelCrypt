The opposite of adoption is happening.
"Imagine you're a payment processing company, and Steam announces that it will no longer accept your payments, because they are unusable. What would that do to your stocks price?

Such news should cause a dip in BTC price, yet we don't see any. BTC is now officially not a currency or a payment system, but a speculative bubble."
"Steam was a huge step for bitcoin adoption, I remember how big the victory was when they accepted bitcoin.

Before that, all the community wanted to buy things with bitcoin, because it was magic (instant and free). The community knew that it was the utilization of a currency that explain it's value.

And now......... ""buy bitcoin, it's an investissement, we will be rich, and quickly""

Times have changed...

This news is clearly a disaster and it hurts the value of bitcoin.
"
The real problem is that the merchants turned off by this horrible devolution of BTC, don't have the patience or passion to bother a second time. It's going to take a lot of convincing to get merchants back on board with any crypto because of this.
merchants are dumping btc left and right and yet somehow magically it's still being pumped. 2+2 = fish.
Thanks blockstream 
Destroyed by the very people that are supposed to protect it. 
"What are the reactions over at r/bitcoin? 

Tabs, anyone?"
"The level of abuse thrown by the BTC crowd on both the website and the twitter is disgusting.

They are having a serious problem because Bitcoin is unreliable for small payments.  Even BTC supporters say to use an alt because BTC should ONLY be a store of value.

I don't get it.  ""Don't spend your BTC.""  Followed by, ""You won't let us spend our BTC at your site, you're an asshole.""

Truly a Jerry Springer show trash fight."
"This is a big deal.  Hopefully this wakes some people up to the fact that Bitcoin will have no value if it cannot be used in the marketplace.  It cannot survive based off of brand and ""store of value"" alone.

If vendors cannot accept it and customers cannot use it, then it will be eclipsed by other currencies."
"I was banned for 120 days from r/Bitcoin just for posting this:

>  so Satoshi was in favor or larger blocks?

""Yup, and also in favor of only miners in server farms running full nodes after the blocksize increase too much. He said users only need SPV wallets. He was a big blocker.

That being said, it does not make big blocks automatically a good thing. It is just what he tought about Bitcoin growing in the future. The BCH scaling roadmap is closer to the original Nakamoto's ideas about that.""

Link: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7hzl78/steam_is_no_longer_supporting_bitcoin/dqv38qf/?st=javislbk&sh=482a9980

r/Bitcoin mods think this is ""disinformation"".

I did not said BCH is better or anyone should move to Bitcoin Cash (I hold both coins). I just quoted Satoshis's own words almost literally.

That poor guy didn't even knew Satoshi's own vision about that.

r/Bitcoin heavy-handed moderation is one of the reasons of the community split. They don't have any issue banning Bitcoin (BTC) supporters that just don't think 100% like them."
It's complete mystery to me why bitcoin in 2015/2016 is so much cheaper than bitcoin in 2017. I actually was able to use and pay for stuffs back then.
That kind of news will get down voted in North Korea
"And here's [why](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2017/11/30/bitcoin-investors-beware-the-irs-wants-its-cut-and-you-may-not-know-it.html)

I presume most people here knew about this already.

The TL;DR is the IRS considers BTC property and is taxed as such. 

Due to its soaring price merchants are ditching it because of the potential tax burden."
"> As of today, Steam will no longer support Bitcoin as a payment method on our platform **due to high fees** and volatility in the value of Bitcoin.

Another victim of the Bitcoin (Core) mafia. Thanks u/theymos u/adam3us u/nullc 

The market can only stay irrational for so long, Bitcoin Core has become unusable. Bitcoin Cash is the future.

&nbsp;

Edit: Perhaps Adam Back can show them how to use tabs?"
WE DID IT BLOCKSTREAM
Well, in fairness, how can they? It's broken. 
bitcoin cash can take over for almost no cost at all 
"Another proud accomplishment of the BlockStream Dream Team.  
Sure, drive out already established merchants from using Bitcoin thanks to insane fees and all but cripple adoption by refusing to scale, after all who needs Bitcoin as a currency when it's primarily a ""store of value"" right?  
Sometimes i think about what Satoshi envisioned as the future of Bitcoin and i weep; thank god there is Bitcoin Cash to carry forward the banner for an inclusive, fast, decentralized and censorship resistant P2P cryptocurrency."
Anybody notice the sudden increase in bitcoin price coinciding with the Steam news and also a sudden spike in Tether volume? Is that just a coincidence, or is someone trying to prop up BTC price? artificially?
translation: steamcoin ICO launching in 10 days.
the beginning of the end. 
Hello, my name is Bitcoin Cash and I work as a means of payment or money if you will (cash) in my free time which I have a lot of (8MB worth, soon to be 32MB). Good to meet you Steam, we are going to have a lot of fun time together!
"The market can stay irrational far longer than we may expect. The hype driving bitcoin could persist... 

...or it could turn in a day. I've been heavy in BTC for a long time. 

Now I think it's time to make myself antifragile in the crypto space. More BCH. More Dash. Still hold Btc. 

I love crypto in general. Let's build the future. "
And so it begins...
"Because I'm a total cynical, here's what I think will happen with cryptocurrency. We'll spend several years cycling through this process of a previously promising currency being destroyed from within only for another currency to pop up reverting to the original specifications of bitcoin which becomes widely adopted. Eventually investors and everyday people have own various worthless cryptos demand government regulation on cryptocurrency and we'll eventually end up with a state sponsored ""bitdollar"" that is not finite but rather is a digital implementation of modern Fiat currency which people willingly adopt for it's convenience and security. Maybe this move undercuts the current banking system by allowing people to borrow directly from the central bank at the current interest rate and making things like private home loans obsolete.

We'll end up with some weird combination of unregulated Bitcoin and the federally backed US Dollar in a way that the average person won't really know the difference. I guess at least that's still somewhat of an improvement from what we have today."
Such a shame, they should be accepting Bitcoin Cash.
Thanks goes to the Blockstream clowns.
Sounds like Bitcoin Core is finally losing Steam.
Someone tell them to replace it with Bitcoin Cash
Who do I reach out to at Steam to convince them to accept Bitcoin Cash and let Rocketr handle that for them?
They should add Bitcoincash instead.
This is like when my brother said I couldn't buy his video games for Pokemon Cards anymore :/
Waiting for the BTC bubble to burst is like waiting for the new season of Thrones. It's been a long wait, but it's gonna be one hell of a ride once it starts up.
These guys are such idiots. They should just open tabs with their customers. If you don't understand why this is a brilliant solution, then you probably don't have a PhD like I do.

Once bitpay support Bitcoin cash I am selling all my Bitcoin. My money goes where the adoption is.
If bitcoin (cash) survive this, I am quite confident about it's chance to survive anything
"Is steam database the same thing as steam the gaming market?

Edit: nevermind.  the link goes to a steam release.  Wow.  This is huge."
Bearish for Bitcoin much.
"If Bitcoin is truly that convenient, just cash out for whatever amount you wanted and pay steam with cash.

"
dafaq!
Let's campaign bitpay and after that steam!
GJ, core team, GJ.
Loss of trust. That's how it starts...
This news basically shook my last bit of hope for btc. Just bought a ton of Bitcoin Cash and bought some precious metals with the rest of it
Is this really a surprise to anyone? From what I've read of peoples' opinions online I thought the general view was that Bitcoin was more like a lottery ticket and not an actual viable currency.
Ask them to accept Bitcoin Cash as a replacement 
Everyone with a steam account please leave a comment about #Bitcoin Cash and lower fees.
But they use bitpay and they are going to accept Bitcoin Cash soon 
"This is gold ""As of today, Steam will no longer support Bitcoin as a payment method on our platform due to high fees and volatility in the value of Bitcoin."""
"Having read the press release, I do see this as a very sensible decision, as disappointing as it may be. Steam users have a very high overlap with the current Bitcoin demographic, but currently the cons to accepting it outweigh the pros.

At least Steam does seem to have people on board who understand Bitcoin well enough that they will probably reconsider this decision when new scaling tools come out, or maybe another currency in the interim (perhaps Bitcoin Cash if Bitpay begins accepting it).

I see this as temporary, even though I have to admit it scares me a bit. Bitcoin has to scale. If it remains a store of value and isn't readopted by merchants when fees come down, I will consider that a failed experiment."
"Makes sense. Unfortunate for the crypto space.

Hopefully Steam will consider adding another crypto that has greater scalability and lower transaction fees.

I see BTC as a store of value now , contrary to the title of the original white paper.
"
Lots of complaining here, but Steam does make some good points from the perspective of a business selling a product.  These problems need to be solved.
"> As of today, Steam will no longer support Bitcoin as a payment method on our platform due to high fees and volatility in the value of Bitcoin.
> 
> In the past few months we've seen an increase in the volatility in the value of Bitcoin and a significant increase in the fees to process transactions on the Bitcoin network. For example, transaction fees that are charged to the customer by the Bitcoin network have skyrocketed this year, topping out at close to $20 a transaction last week (compared to roughly $0.20 when we initially enabled Bitcoin). Unfortunately, Valve has no control over the amount of the fee. These fees result in unreasonably high costs for purchasing games when paying with Bitcoin. The high transaction fees cause even greater problems when the value of Bitcoin itself drops dramatically.
> 
> Historically, the value of Bitcoin has been volatile, but the degree of volatility has become extreme in the last few months, losing as much as 25% in value over a period of days. This creates a problem for customers trying to purchase games with Bitcoin. When checking out on Steam, a customer will transfer x amount of Bitcoin for the cost of the game, plus y amount of Bitcoin to cover the transaction fee charged by the Bitcoin network. The value of Bitcoin is only guaranteed for a certain period of time so if the transaction doesn’t complete within that window of time, then the amount of Bitcoin needed to cover the transaction can change. The amount it can change has been increasing recently to a point where it can be significantly different.
>
> The normal resolution for this is to either refund the original payment to the user, or ask the user to transfer additional funds to cover the remaining balance. In both these cases, the user is hit with the Bitcoin network transaction fee again. This year, we’ve seen increasing number of customers get into this state. With the transaction fee being so high right now, it is not feasible to refund or ask the customer to transfer the missing balance (which itself runs the risk of underpayment again, depending on how much the value of Bitcoin changes while the Bitcoin network processes the additional transfer).
> 
> At this point, it has become untenable to support Bitcoin as a payment option. We may re-evaluate whether Bitcoin makes sense for us and for the Steam community at a later date.
> 
> We will continue working to resolve any pending issues for customers who are impacted by existing underpayments or transaction fees.

"Ask them on Steam to support Bitcoin Cash instead since it has low TX fees:

http://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/1464096684955433613"
"Honestly they are right

Even Satoshi said the system was about low fees

But what happened is the number for fees remained the same as the price increased whereas the mining fee should’ve decreased.

I guess they may adopt Bitcoin Cash? Living the real concept"
I wonder how many other merchant will look at things like this and be less likely to look into crypto as a means of payment as a result.
"> Less than two years after adopting Bitcoin as a payment option on Steam, Valve has announced that it is dropping support for the virtual currency. The decision to eliminate the option comes as a result of both the extremely high transaction fees charged by Bitcoin, and recent, also-extremely-high levels of instability in its value.

emphasis on:

>The decision to eliminate the option comes as a result of both the **extremely high transaction fees** charged by Bitcoin, and recent, **also-extremely-high levels of instability in its value**.""

See what you've done, Blockstream Core?"
Can't blame them, currencies are supposed to be stable and bitcoin is currently anything but stable. 
I mean...I wouldn’t take it as currency either. It’s too volatile. If the price goes down tomorrow then it loses half its value or whatever. It will go down, just how much is the question. 
The problem is Bitcoin Cash is so not known that Steam didn’t even know it was an option. Instead of switching they just eliminated crypto payments.... sigh
bitcoin is just to volatile for a merchant to keep up. You'd have to adjust your prices daily because of the strong fluctuations. That could be fine if you'd sell 5 products but it's impossible for a whole library. Djeez just imagine having a restaurant and you have to print out a new menu every day.
That poor twitter account got so flooded with BCH zealots they have to keep saying that they're not affiliated with Valve, but people still keep telling them to use BCH instead.
"I was walking a buddy through purchasing crypto. he opened up an account on coinbase and bittrex and when he went to send his BTC to his exchange account he submitted the transfer at 11am Tuesday and didn't get it confirmed until today (Wednesday).  
  
BTC might be worth 10-12K right now, but with the lag in the transaction confirmations, I am not investing in or using BTC no time soon (outside of a medium to purchase altcoins.)"
F*ck! We have to build the infrastructure two times! Thank you, Blockstream/Core...
There’s no real worth to bitcoin, I won’t be surprised of it never becomes mainstream or plummets in value. It’s a supply choked fiat money, hate to break it to you.
I should start a tab with some of my steam friends 
[deleted]
TIL steam supports Bitcoin.
CONSOLIDATED EFFORT TO INFORM THEM ABOUT BITCOIN CASH: BEGIN!!!
Sinne gaming has always been setting trends this is terrible news and i cant blame it on steam to be fair. 
Steam will accept another Cryptocurrency. It’s just a matter of which one 
Good
Cough cough Bitcoin crash imment cough cough
">Its too big to fail

South Sea Bubble and Housing market. Do you know why they are similar? They all were all speculative bubbles with false values and constant hype, and then they crashed and burned extremely badly and had the same tag line Its too big to fail"
Fix the transaction fee problem and the hemorrhaging will stop.
"Tax plan passed which increased the debt by a trillion and in turn weakens the dollar.

BTC has more value than a USD as demonstrated by the upwards surge. Its scarce because theres a finite amount where our shit US govt keeps printing money. When you have more and more of something the value spreads out accordingly.

If enough people places value on something ...it can be traded. It has value.

RIP Gadaffi

"That's the last straw, I already sold half my BTC last week, now the other half will follow.

Fuck Core, they ruined it.

"Going to have very few arguments for the blockstream supporters that said this wouldn't happen. 

""But just wait for lightning""

How long must we wait? Until Bitcoin is dead?"
Good job Core and supporters! You're so far successful on your path of destroying Bitcoin. 
Screw you, /u/bitpay. Scorched earth or what is this shit about? You're damaging the whole crypto space and ruining it for everybody. Support Bitcoin Cash and a couple of alt-coins already.

Funny- literally just saw news of this elsewhere.  Had a feeling this would be on r/btc ... came right over here to check my premonition..... TOP NEWS?!?! Sad.  Bitcoin-hate is the top news in a BCH-driven subreddit?  SMH
Makes sense. Bitcoin is no longer a good option for smaller payments but why have they not simply replaced it with Litecoin? 
"Weird. Random twitter post in an account that says ""not affiliated with valve in anyway"" linking to a forum post by a random guy I couldnt glance over a connection to the valve/steam team."
I am dummy holding some BTC, what should I do?
">BitPay is also planning on adding additional blockchains to their repertoire. By next year, Pair says they will natively support 4-5 additional blockchains, determining which ones by their ability to enable payments and by market cap size. They plan to add their first new cryptocurrency in the next two months. This will help consumers who are moving towards other cryptocurrencies in order to avoid bitcoin’s current high transaction fees.

[From an interview with Stephen Pair of BitPay today](https://hypepotamus.com/news/bitpay-30m-series-b/)"
Unless bitcoin drops off the #1 spot it's going potentially delay crypto adoption by years. Bitcoin Cash will never be the solution, it'll always cause confusion by living in the shadow of the original bitcoin.
"Check the rBitcoin thread, it's worth it:

* Thread sorted by **controversial** because the top answers blame fees, not scapegoats

* BashCo pinning ""everything is fine we have LN soon"""
well they should just use another crypto or fiat or tabs. 
The top comment on North Korea thread about this has a stickied video of Lightning Network Demo on Youtube lol.
All aboard the sale train 
Because there is no point in terms of fees or time to use it anymore. 
Why don't they embrace an alternate like etherium or monero?  
Do they except gold? Why would they accept digital gold? They should use litecoin or Iota.
Didn't even know steam accepted Bitcoin
RIP my now non-existent wallet. I️ deposited in BTC a lot.
I just started buying games this way. I only got one.
Maybe we should have accepted the move to Segwit2x? That would have probably helped? 
Are you fucking kidding me
Walpole did it. 
Is there anywhere a out of the loop person can understand this a bit more? No matter how hard I try I can never fully comprehend the whole system. Maybe an ELI5?
Short Bitcoin
This is SteamDB, not Steam. Still, it's sad.
People who believe in the technology will carry on carrying on. Doesn't have to be btc, personally I prefer the team behind Litecoin but that's just my opinion in this speculative world of crypto.
Want to talk about a scary market that could be taking place if retailers start rejecting BTC. 
Guess peer to peer remains btc’s focus.
interesting
the main problem with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin is that aren't enough marketmakers to stabilize the price for transactions to complete. Add to that there aren't derivative devices like options to narrow the bid/ask price & lower transactional costs.
I didn't know it was an option to begin with.
Ruh roh raggy
Where can I get a short position?? 
SHORT SHORT SHORT
Shit. I just bought a game for BTC two days ago. 
I think Bitcoin will become more of a storage of money at this point. Some other coin will become the spending of said money. I kind of thought that's how Litecoin would work out, or maybe DASH. Who knows, it all feels very wrong and not like how Bitcoin was supposed to be
"Yikes.

Can anyone point me in the right direction to find out about paying taxes on my BTC gains? 

t. Total n00b"
New paradigm
Of course. Tell me when you can walk to the store and buy bread with your bitcoins. Not a currency. I’ll buy when the bubble pops and it drops to sub 1k
How can you mine BCH?
They don't like how unstable the currency is. 
I’m not advocating one or way or another I’m just asking how deflationary currency would be handled. 
Steam should support btc!
What bubble ?? - I wish I have bought more bitcoin if it wasn't for the dam bank and the exchange dragging their foot and put a hold on my money.  I would have bought more bitcoins and gained equity on my investment...instead, my usd money is seating on the exchange (finally) and the Bitcoin price is at $14,300, which is more than $2,300 higher than 24 hours ago...
Looking forward to the BTC dip. Then we can already play fallout 5 on our pc's, while paying in BTCs
"So let me get this straight: (purely looking for education)

1. How does adoption of accepting a crypto help the asset BCH grow?"
The major reason is because bitcoin price is far from stable, and can change thousands in 1 single day.
SODL - what you would call the equivalent of HODL in selling mode? 
We still accept bitcoin at www.Negash83.com
No Bitcoin no game
Good, they were overcharging. 
you can't walk into Walmart and pay with a bar of Gold. Same logic.
Traitors! Long live Core! /s
ENJINCOIN the crypto for gaming.
why is blocksize a public debate? Bitcoin can add 2nd layers. Is bitcoin like a Swiss bank account for moving large sums of money or for micro transactions like buying coffee? What about rootstock, side chains, atomic swaps? 
Get the fuck out of Bitcoin while you still have any money at all.
LOL! So this is reddit bitcoin and you guys actually hate bitcoin? You should open a tulip subreddit and talk about tulips all day.
Should they use BCash instead?
Well, they never accepted gold, so I guess that makes it pretty clear which direction BTC is headed. 
But my currency of the future!??!?!?
Steam is rightfully worried, exchange risk is a major problem. Wonder what exchange CME will settle bitcoin futures through.. 
makes sense since BTC is no longer made for payments
So, It might be true that the central planners will short Bitcoin. I don't care. I luv Monero!
"I'm not surprised.

If Bitcoin transaction fees don't come down to 2% - 3% to compete with major payment processing services then it will never see mass market adoption for payment processing.  The last Bitcoin payment I sent today had TX fees over 10%, 4x higher than my other payment processing services - it's fucking ridiculous and I'm losing interest in using it for business.

Bitcoin developers and miners had better start figuring out how to compete with mainstream payment processors."
Has anyone tried posting this on That Other Sub yet?  It's definitely Bitcoin news.
It will keep rising now matter what. 
This is good for bitcoin.
Thread was hijacked by a bunch of morons who don't understand cryptocurrency. Muh tulips, muh.bubble, muh Bitcoin is dead,  same rhetoric for years. Wake up you fucking zombies. Time to make peace that the old system you worship in fiate is nonsense. Your dollars are losing value and most people who own are not going to give them up especially at these low prices.

...I just bought a really nice gaming machine a few days ago, and was about to start buying steam games with bitcoin.   Oh well.  I guess I'll just use my credit card.
This post has also a huge amount of upvotes on r/bitcoin.
The divide is amazing because many are upset that it is not being adopted and others are upset that people are not HODLing. I wonder why Steam is no longer accepting it though. Perhaps the fees and wait times are an issue. 
">The value of Bitcoin is only guaranteed for a certain period of time so if the transaction doesn’t complete within that window of time, then the amount of Bitcoin needed to cover the transaction can change. The amount it can change has been increasing recently to a point where it can be significantly different.

This is stupid. Bitcoin is a currency. You wouldn't change the amount of £ the game costs because the USD conversion rate changes from day to day. They should just charge an exact number of satoshi, and hold until they can cash out to their preferred currency at a profit. "
"Haha - fools. They are stopping for different reasons. 

I just transferred Bcash today and it takes for fucking ever!

Steam is not using bitcoin any longer, because it's too volatile for their business.
"
"Can someone tell me what is the point of using cryptocurrency on Steam? No one gives a fuck what games you'll play. The currency should be used on stuff you dont want the government to know. Paying for normal shit like games or coffee is just...stupid. The irony here is that cryptocurrency showed us that real currency is better for normal use. Cryptocurrency is only used by investors, and they dont do anything with it but sit on it.

Btw, I love text on the right.

""There is no government, company, or bank in charge of Bitcoin. As such, it is more resistant to **wild inflation** and corrupt banks.""

Yeah, but not to wild deflation, which is just as damaging. Who would wanna put any serious money into a system with such fluctuation? And look at whats happening now. Sure, no corrupt banks, instead the value is decided not by anything real, like changes on the market, but instead by investors wanting to make a quick buck."

Further proof that bitcoin is more of a scam/pyramid scheme/false construct than an actual valuable entity.  Its use should be banned everywhere.  
So long weak playa Volvo. If you HODL why care about high fees?!
Maybe they think it'll drop soon so they're withdrawing acceptance?
"Could the problem not be on Valve's end?

I'm just surprised at all the doom and gloom comments, Valve only started accepting bitcoin a week or two ago, and had a terrible implementation of it. Steam does kind of suck these days, maybe Gabe and his army of algorithms couldnt hack it."
Use Litecoin
"I guess they realized anybody can make a shitcoin  
And worst of all: people will adopt it"
Converting BTC to LTC
Its sad that both sides are freaking out right now... The btc trolls and bch trolls cant control themselves over tiny changes... How about waiting and seeing what will happen since NOBODY KNOWS..
Probably smart since it's fake money
who cares ?!
Steam has had their throats cut by the world Government
What’s the conversion rate of BTC to Schrute Bucks? 
They should’ve switched to bcash.  No volatility. Always 1400-1600 range.
This sub is so closed minded. While you circle jerk to bitcoin cash, litecoin and btc atomic swaps coming around the corner. Go ahead sell your btc, hopefully I'll catch your minuscule dip. Either way lol I'm happy got my alts :) 
every time a service stops accepting btc, price rises because there's less sellers.
