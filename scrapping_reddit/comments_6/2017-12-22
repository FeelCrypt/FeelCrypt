Congratulations to everyone for pushing for positive change. 
holy shit
Absolutely remarkable growth thus far. Congratulations to the Bitcoin community, and thank you Coinbase!
Bitcoin Cash is the manifestation of the Honey Badger.  Congratulations everybody, every single member of this community played a part and its only the beginning.  We can finally build and transact normally again.  Common sense has come back to rule the day.  Bitcoin Cash is the true Bitcoin! /u/tippr gild
"Just want to point out something funny, /r/bitcoin is celebrating that Coinbase users can finally dump their ""bcash"", and are saying that the price is going **up** because of all the Coinbase users **selling** their ""shitcoins"". This is the economic illiteracy we're up against."
Omg what is going on with bitcoin cash!! I'm seeing it for $8,500 wtf?!?!?
"OMG OMG. Don't know what to say. I don't even know why I'm so happy!

Did anyone see that huge spike to .28 on Bittrex? It dropped back down to .17 now it's up to .22 as I write this. Whaaaaaaaa this is insane!
Time to go on a tipping spree in the wider reddit?

Can anyone buy yet?! Doesn't seem ready. Any idea what happened at 6:40-6:45pm?
"Man I've just got one lonely BCH but it's about to get 6 confirmations and loaded into Coinbase.  Hoping I can sell tonight and buy back after a correction.

Whatever happens, one thing is inevitable...

why does it say bitcoin cash purchases are temporarily disabled?
Great now everyone will dump this sh...3k??? Wait that one isn't on my core manual, instructions unclear, flippening happening.

OMG YES!!! Thank you Coinbase!
Just paused my bitcoin autobuy. Time to start a BCH autobuy.
"Anyone else’s Coinbase freaking out!;"

Who else bought in at 5300? 
Note to self: Buy the currency before Coinbase starts selling it 😜
"Hell yeah!!

Glad they did this. Finally I can buy some BCH.
"YES!!!!!!

""Sends and receives are available immediately.""

YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES!!

BITCOIN IS BACK!
Congrats to all that made this happen at Coinbase and the BCH ecosystem at large.
I pleased that a real digital currency will now be available to customers frustrated with bitcoin core
Man am I glad I bought at under 2k. I even paid a ridiculous fee because I used my debit card and I don't care. 
LOL I was just finishing a trade on GDAX from BTC to ETH so I can then buy Bitcoin Cash on another exchange, and when I go back to Coinbase to check my balances this announcement hits me out of the blue... well, back to GDAX again
Holly ......
BAM!
Hmmm won’t let me buy BCH. Wonder when I will be able to?
"**HELL YEAHHHHHH!!!!**

any idea how long before they enable purchases? 
WHATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT THE PRICE HAS GONE THROUGH THE ROOF WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO THANK YOU GUYS 
"Anyone else remember thinking ""gee, I don't know if I should buy any more"" back ~$320?"
Wow, I know they said it would happen in 2017 but I didn’t expect it suddenly like this. 
Coinbase says bch is 8k right now.  Lol
"Sooooo..... is anyone selling on Coinbase @ $8,500?

It's gotta come down....right???"
"All BCH books will enter cancel-only mode, and all existing orders will be cleared. While in cancel-only mode, no new orders will be accepted. We will post an update shortly. 

wth does this mean?"
Is the dump already starting? Huge selloffs on everywhere but bithumb

Wow, I seriously thought Segwit would happen first, just to stay face to the BTC community. This is amazing!
Pity that the orange is not doing well during the flippening. I hope it comes back once the segwit1mb fork dies off.
Damn!  Looks like you guys have caused coinbase to go down again!  :)
"There were some haters saying they could only withdraw bitcoin cash. Glad to see you can buy bitcoin cash! Awesome :) 

There is also rumors of coinbase adding monero and eos in 2018 which is good to see"
annnnnd we broke GDAX already
Can someone tell me what’s happening? I saw it go from 4000 to 1700 in a minute. Now I can figure out the price
[deleted]
Is my app bugging out or did BCH go up by 5k in the last hour? 
Coinbase showing 8500.00 for me someone slap me with a tip
What crazy times to be alive, so many vertical graphs... My heart goes to all who fell for the BS sabotage operation.
I'm so happy about this! We finally did it! Despite all the bashing on BCH in my country's main crypto Telegram chat, I ignored the noise and held on to what I believe in. Here we go! Bitcoin Cash! 
Going to be sick with this much movement. Holy smokes.
I bought on gdax during the 3 minutes it was up. It says that I bought at 5250, but apparently it never even hit that high, as it's showing 3100 on other sites atm. Will it correct? 
"Uh, I don't have any BCH in my Coinbase account. It says you had to have BitCoin on August 1, 2017. I don't know if I did--I possibly sold my balance by that date. But I had BTC before and after that date.

You had to have it explicitly on that date? I haven't kept up with any of this so I don't know. I thought the BTC blockchain was copied, but I guess that means it was only copied at one instance, and isn't a running copy? "
Only buy, send, and receive if you’re in Canada.
Why didn't they announce this in advance? Like in the [roadmap](https://mobile.twitter.com/Andrea_Dispe/status/943330470552485888) they released just a few days ago? And why did they push a production update at like 5pm??? This has so many things about it that scream scam to me. I'm extremely suspicious. A crash is coming.
"Sooo... this is why I woke up to a couple thousand more...

Good... good...

Any idea why BTC is going down? *wink* *wink*

Edit: ok... after all this time I just learnt how to format text in Reddit. "
"but now the period of high volatility
"
who's counting down till bch is available for trading on gdax?
"Sell options were disabled from the get go, right, but buys were allowed?

I enjoy the pump, but I'm really hesitant about what's going to happen when sell is enabled. 

Unless it's been enabled already. Then .... well, that's pretty neat, then. Can someone clue me in?"
Except you can’t buy or sell. 👌 nice.

Everyone that was holding bitcoin on coinbase during the fork just got access to their bch.  More coins will now hit the market. I would think bch price will fall from this, but I guess we will see.

ITS HAPPENING
Coinbase is not a safe option for people who want to remain anonymous. imo
For somebody who knows nothing about cryptocurrency, what is the difference between bitcoin and bitcoin cash?
What is bitcoin cash? Is it different? 
Yeah but it takes weeks to get money into coinbase
Think I’m gonna get an investment into BCH now aswell! To the moon
/u/tippr for president!
"mfw when I suddenly got a bunch of BCH because I was holding BTC at the time of the fork

Well let's test how well tippr works"
In theory.... 
Coinbase, where is my money, it straight up disappeared ok your platform! 10k!
"Can I use Coinbase in Germany?

It says it is not supported. But I have heard of people having used it in the past"
Care to explain for someone from r/all?
According to Bloomberg coin base will start trading again at 9am Pacific time
I'm a cryptocoin newb. Is buying and selling going to be pretty straightforward?
Guys please tell me BTC will go down again when bcash resumes coinbase trading. 
With crypto ... should I buy at a low price or a high price? When I see a high price, I think I should buy as it's going up... but then when it drops, I realise I get more for less but then I'm scared if it crashes ...
If GDAX and Coinbase trading of Bitcoin Cash is disabled, why is the price still going up and down in their app? In the last hour, as at 10:55 am EST it says its up $20.87 CAD...
"Anybody scared what is going to happen once GDAX enables BCC trading? 
Thinking of transferring it to Bittrex .
"
The sales have resumed, at least at GDAX. They went live at 11am pst
I send my bitcoin funds from binance to bitcoin cash on coinbase but the funds no show up. I lost my money?
So it was trading last night at 9,500 it crashed and is at 3,700 how is it in the green? And why is there no evidence of this on the graphs. Think they should halt all trading on Bitcoin cash until this huge hiccup is taken care of. People need to research before they buy.
Well that is a big news for Bitcoin Cash but I mean who didn't see this coming?
"Since Coinbase currently disabled BCH buying could I then do this:

- Deposit USD on Coinbase

- Send to GDAX

- Set a limit order and buy BTC

- Use Shapeshift to BCH

- HODL"
"Is it correct that you still can't trade BCH on CoinBase? If so, is there an ETA for when this will happen?

Can't seem to find anything on their Twitter and the subreddit is a shit-show ATM."
"I received BCH from Coinbase because I had BTC stored there on Aug 1st. There may be millions of customers like me who got ""free money"" (correct me if I'm wrong).

How does Coinbase back this with fiat?"

"Bitcoin Cash is the the most authentic version of Bitcoin to what Satoshi envisioned in 2008.

Congrats to everyone who made some good money just now. It’s always good to see people make money. Especially the underdogs. Hats off to BCH
ATTN: If you go into the CoinBase app, select BCH, and click on the end of the graph (current time). The correct current price will show, which happens to be $3,108.01 at the time of this post (6:45PM AZ).
Damn, Ver was right. I think in his AMA yesterday, when asked if Coinbase will support it in 2018, he said they will support it in 2017.
Hello balance my old friend.
I'm from popular. What does this mean to us?
Thanks for all of you guys who worked so hard for BCH, devs, businesses, community 🚀
I dont understand wtf is going on? Can someone explain? What is Bitcoin Cash & How does it compare to regular Bitcoin?
prepare for pump & dump bch xdd
"Are they gonna let people buy this shit or what? This is a joke. The price of BCH continues to rise, meanwhile nobody can purchase on coinbase.

What a fucked up scenario."
Remember in November when this same thing happened?  Its going to happen again when everyone dumps there bcash and you guys are holding bags.
SELL BCASH !
I feel so lucky. Went all in BCH last week believing in the better fundamentals, and now I'm up $150. FeelsGoodMan

It’s down $5300 this hour
Congratulations Bitcoin Cash, I hope this will be the Bitcoin killer, since Bitcoin has been hijacked by Blockstream and banks. 
I just came back from work and because I wanted to have a good laugh, first thing I did is I went to read r/bitcoin.  Jesus I should have invested in Salt futures, it's fucking hilarious how batshit insanely delusional and salty people are over there. :)

"Thank you u/bdarmstrong

I know you don't take sides and I know this was probably mostly if not entirely a business decision. But I still wanted to thank you for enabling buying and trading of Bitcoin Cash, and for doing it way earlier than most people even speculated. That is awesome! I look forward to telling people they no longer have to transfer their slow and expensive BTC from Coinbase to buy BCH. Now I will just tell them to buy it directly on coinbase! Ignore the onslaught of trolling you will get for this. They are a vocal minority. The fact is, bitcoin is unusable. It is a clown-show and everyday it becomes more and more obvious. Bitcoin Cash was the obvious next coin to add for a number of reasons. Thank you!"

And jumped to 8 eth. Hot dog
"CHEESE AND RICE!

I'm glad I have BTH in my portfolio haha"
Sell gling sub 2k
Coinbase, the site where I can't verify my account because it doesn't detect any of my identity cards! Feels good
GDAX not taking any orders at all
As a casual, what does this mean? Should I leave btc for bch?
So I’ve had a crypto wallet for some time with btc from a small purchase growing to about $30 so that was cool to watch. If I can now buy and sell bch easily should I just buy a small amount of bch to turn quickly in the next few weeks. I have very little knowledge on crypto currency but any info would be appreciated. 
Freaking damn, wanted to buy BCH since 300 still waiting for verifications.. 
"Ah, glad my coinbase account is acting up and I can’t get any support because... well because it is coinbase

Does anyone have a good way to get my money out of coinbase to another wallet?"
I get off the internet for a few measly hours and this happens?! Can't step away for one second without missing out, I swear
"Still waiting to actually be able to buy bch.

I'll eventually figure out how to wrest my 0.029 I had back in August from my wallet (not at coinbase), but for now there's no need."
So for every one of these forks, if it occurred at a time you own BTC, you have an equal amount of that new coin? 
I sent some BCH form coinbase app to my hw wallet address and it's still pending, did I lose it?
If i want someone to pay me in Bitcoin is this the way to do it? 
Nice to know they don’t just waste all their time on useless things like customer service....

"I sent out my bictoin cash to a wallet and the transaction url gives me a 404. Coinbase posted this message on their page : ""Partially Degraded Service: Outgoing Bitcoin Cash transactions are currently not being sent. Our team is investigating.""
"
Just lovely.  Sitting on 4 confirmations, about 90 minutes into my transfer to GDAX.  Thought I was fine when it hit 4 about 30 minutes ago.
A word of advice. Because of the selloff of stashed BCH in coinbase, the price will most likely drop to about 35-3600 before arbitrage from other exchanges and pumpers buying the dip. Therefore it's wise to probably set up a limit order at about 3600 and watch closely to increase your bid if the plateau comes before then. 
"Which trading system should i use if i am from EU and want one that doesnt use tethers? I really like the graph on bittrex(bars updated live, not just a line like on coinbase and bitstamp). GDAX says trading is unavailable in my region. Or maybe i should trust tethers and stay on bittrex?
"
"I'm so angry right now. I got paid today. I want to buy BCH and ride the wave. I see it on coinbase, and every minute it's value is rising, Yet coinbase won't let me purchase it because purchases are ""temporarily disabled"" And yes I know technically I could join another exchange but I just really like the convenience of coinbase. The other exchanges want way more identity documents and I just haven't had the time for that."
It says BCH is temporarily disabled. When is this being fixed? 
Fucking Coinbase restricted my buys
They will fuck that up also.
"You can buy bitcoin cash in QuadrigaCX: https://www.quadrigacx.com/?ref=8pznsyqm3cbbycx0ebbm3twr
Deposit or withdraw directly from Canada banks."
I sold BTC at LiviaCoins and I got paid very fast directly in my bank account
Is BCH is a good long term investment? If so, what is the technical analysis to support this? 
The fees are stupid, 20$ to send 50? Bitcoin will NEVER amount to anything like that
coinbase are digging information from your account details and doing lord knows what with it. I would recommend something other than coinbase. They sent me a message to my main crypto email with the name of the other person on my joint bank account rather than using my name. that shows that they are digging information from our accounts don't know why they are doing it but they are. just a heads up and wanting to spread the information. Really wish I hadn't gotten into crypto at this point.
Why is BCH sinking like a stone right now?
Get ready for a dump as people spend the unexpected free money before Christmas. 
Even though I bought my first bitcoin in June, I fell in love with bitcoin and its altruistic motive. Unfortunately I soon realized BTC was not what i had bought into but held out in hopes we would move towards what it once was. No problem, if it doesn’t at least I have BCH.

"Funny story about Coinbase and Bitcoin.

A few years ago I created a Coinbase account and received $0.01 of a bitcoin. The other week I checked the account after forgetting about it and that $0.01 is now worth $3.43

So you could say I'm a prodigy of investing."
Well i guess we are going to the Moon now :) 
New to Bitcoin, what does this mean?
Bout time.
I told them just late friday that coinbase was likely to bring BCH onboard not only for offloading but for trading. i dont think they believed me. 
"holey fuck.

as much as i have reservations about the development teams behind it, congratulations you'all."
"Ah fuck this, Ive supported bitcoin for ages but I'm finally starting to see its major flaws. To proliferate effectively it needs to be easily accessible and stable, neither are being achieved.

""This great new crypto is here! Buy it so the creators cash in and it becomes a con""

At the end of the day, crypto is subject to the same flaws that fiat is, its just that everyone thinks they'll be rich so are panic buying as news hits major outlets."

"I don't get it, what's so amazing about this?

Interesting that Coinbase wouldn't automatically claim your BCH for you based on your legacy BTC account that you have with them. Maybe it will still happen.
