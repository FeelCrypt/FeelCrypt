"Your words seem wise.
 Appreciated. BCH surges now, but I guess it rivals not BTC but tries to compete with altcoins

Oh no I lost $2
Report me if you think you've been treated unfairly.
I explained what I did, you can either accept my words as truthful or not. I'm done discussing this topic.
">LTC is also 4 times faster than BCH. And guaranteed to clear first block. And more secure. And is growing at a faster rate over the past 3 months (or virtually any other data point you want to use with the stat ""daily unique transactions"").


Huh

> I have no investment in LTC so I don't exactly have a horse in this race. 

Sounds like you're either a liar or an idiot. If LTC is so amazing, why the hell don't you own any?  What kind of fool are you? TIMES WASTING YOU'RE MISSING OUT!  Lol.

>Liberated token independent of the Bitcoin Core team. That's a new description. Impressive word creation there.

Maybe, what you're really here to do is to degrade Bitcoin Cash through whatever means necessary.  Because what I can't figure out is why someone that thinks so very highly of Litecoin doesn't own any and is wasting his time hanging out in a Bitcoin sub taking positions on Bitcoin politics."
You stated what you did, which was already obvious from several comments ago. You failed to explain it though.
"Vote brigading is defined [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/36xhxc/what_is_brigading_and_how_do_you_do_it/).

As you can see, no vote brigading happened here, but feel free to continue to piss in the wind."
"It's easier to delete the letters. To do strike through requires particular formatting. You went out of your way to use the word ""paid"" and then struck it out with formatting code. What is your goal? You communicated a crossed out word. This isn't a sheet of notebook paper, this is reddit. Be honest."
You seem mad - must've struck a nerve. You know what I meant and you know what you're doing.
"They are still way too high, you can get a transaction confirmed on BCH for less than 1 cent. And here is where you'll say ""BCH network isn't as congested as BTC, no one is using it and that's why fees are cheaper"". Back in January there was a stress test on BCH, 150k transactions per day as opposed to the usually 2k transactions, and the median fee was $0.02"
"Mad? You're delusional. This humors me.

There's *nothing at all* inappropriate about calling attention to something within the community so the whole community can see it. That's the appropriate use of Reddit and is why you aren't expected to use np links for linking to conversations within the sub.

What's frowned upon is turning one community against another. That did not happen here whatsoever.

You're just dead wrong.  And an astroturfing shill to boot."
Highly doubt the mods here would ever do anything about vote brigading. It's their form of censorship.
So has coinbase resolved their customer service ticket queue yet? Because I still have an outstanding issue from 3 months ago. How are they going to handle supporting this?
I will look into some other options, thanks for the information.
What's your point? It takes effort to do that, and is clearly intentional. Are you trying to be clever?
If your worried about the difference between 2 cent and 1 cent u don’t need to be in this game 
Calling out those who lie and deceive seems like a good practice to me. Seems like the opposite of censorship in some ways at least. 
"Yes, I claim Bitcoin Cash is the rightful continuation of the project ""[Bitcoin: a Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System](http://bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf)"" and furthermore it *is* older than LTC, as it contains the Genesis block signed by Satoshi Nakamoto; however, as a liberated token independent of the Bitcoin Core team, BCH has only existed for 6 months, and must rebuild network effects. This is happening at a far greater rate than ever happened with Litecoin, which is likely why Litecoin founder Charlie Lee recently dumped all his coins."
"Fear of ""centralization"" is not same as actual risk of ""centralization."" I fear a meteor smashing through my roof.

1 CPU:1 vote sounds great. I would love that. As decentralized as possible. However, we already know that will never happen. Neither of us are going to give up our spv wallets. Asics exist and they're not going back into the barn. 

Your don't have to run your own web server box in your basement in order to have freedom of speech. That what hosting companies are for. Do we fear hosting companies? There are 100s of thousands in every country. We have options. We can even create our own. Just as we can become miners, or mine, if we want to.

Everyday I read about new mining operations starting up in Russia, USA, Canada, Africa, South America... Nothing is centralizing. It's Expanding. Every single sha256 miner that calls themselves efficient (stays in business) mines *both* btc and BCH. Ie, they are equally ""centralized."" 

I've seen many papers exploring simulations of bigger blocks 32mb and beyond. I don't know the best size but it's being sought. We are going forward. I've never any technically backed study showing that 1mb happens to be perfect. That's just the fear talking. ...

Fear of widespread adoption."
"LTC is also 4 times faster than BCH. And guaranteed to clear first block. And more secure. And is growing at a faster rate over the past 3 months (or virtually any other data point you want to use with the stat ""daily unique transactions"").

"There is some optimum block size. The optimum size is not this arbitrary 1mb.

Show me any study findings showing that coincidentally 1mb happens to be perfect. 1.37221mb?  975.2k? 

Fear of touching the max block size limit is not the same as knowing that 1mb is optimal."
Btc fees are rediculously low
"The positive aspects versus other non-php technologies are negligible. Prestashop is PHP and it is much better than woocommerce without being super complicated to hack.

My advice is that if you have few products and want something quick that works and more secure than a hosted Wordpress + Plugins you get a static website hosted in S3, then you get your products into something like Shopify or Bigcommerce and link the site so they can reach your shop. You do not need Wordpress at all, and you can stay away from the Apache+PHP+MySQL stack and Wordpress.

That is virtually free for you unless you have thousands of products and earn millions, now, I cannot tell if those support Bitcoin or not, but you could do a plugin yourself I guess.

That way you do not need to maintain it, you can focus on your product and selling and you do not have to be worried everytime Wordpress needs to be updated because your site may break. Or your site being slow because Wordpress is slow, or be restricted by the plugins it can provide which often are not related to ecommerce.

In general it is not a good idea to have your shop and your website together in the same site. Of course, on the short term all will be good but later on is when the issues appear.

Either way, it is your decision and I am not saying you are completely wrong but I´d stay away from any blogging platform that has been modified to be a Jack of All Trades."
"If BCH is the ""real"" bitcoin as you claim it to be that means it has been around longer than LTC."

"I think you may be reading something more into my edit than is there. I struck out the word ""paid"" because it was the wrong word to use and replaced it with ""made"" because it was the correct word to use. I could have deleted the word ""paid"" and replaced it with ""made"", but I decided to leave it, but struck through, to show the original.

No ""trying to be clever"" was intended."
"What I can't figure out is why someone so guilty of vote-brigading hasn't been banned yet. I had that post up for 15-16 hours and it had 20 upvotes, then all of a sudden, the post is near the bottom of r/btc and suddenly gets 15 downvotes.

r/btc censorship at it's finest."
I don't think you understood what I was trying to say. I was implying the difference is minuscule, which is a good thing. 
"For anyone that thinks XCP is dead I'd advise them to check github. They just don't pump their own coin with hype is all. They have a roadmap for this year and seem to be actively developing as far as I can tell. (Correct me if I'm wrong). 

https://counterparty.io/roadmap/#1515110303054-92969bfa-6914"
"I absolutely agree on all points. For me CounterParty-  and similar metalayers represented (and still does represent) an astonishing advantage, in general, in the context of itself and towards bitcoin. It's logical that should counterparty, or omni become de facto to store assets on THE dominant, battle tested bitcoin chain and users be able to easily transfer them that this is preferential to migrating to another alternate chain even for a bitcoin maximilist that despises any notion of an 'alt'.

 I may be wrong but I think counterparty set the bar high and are possibly the only group who took the proof of burn route to this day?. Which is just one reason why all the hatred towards it seemed a little contrived. 

  I can say that the concept for me was the most fascinating application on 'blockchain' done correctly, fairly and to the benefit of all- not just those involved in the project as was often unfairly implied. I had seen in the wild since the birth of bitcoin itself, again why I never understood the level of obstruction levied against it by some

 I envisaged a lot and i thought that it would only before a matter of time until tokenisation (amongst other things like the concept of a DEX) becomes a word on the tip of everyones tongues. It took some time-  took some bad decisions, lost funds, chain rollbacks and more but it's happening. Albeit at the expense of bitcoin losing dominance and significant dilution that could have been combatted or even largely avoided.

I wholeheartedly agree bitcoin was set back due to the stance some of the core devs, I've spent a lot of time reading and following that. Honestly, fairly shocking behavior and arguably a conflict of interest from a few parties. You summarised it well in the five part post. I'm happy the project is still going along but I truly wish the devs of counterparty had not abandoned it so early and gone total radio silence because I think they could have pushed it forward and kept optimism going. They were the satoshi, the vitalik that was needed IMO but I suppose they had other priorities and had their reasons, I respect the time they did exist.  It's a real shame the project wasn't sitting on piles of money and hype like ethereum it never reached that critical mass point where they could leave and have community takeover. Part of me still wishes they would come back and say the fight isn't over yet, I beleive there could be a renewed optimism. But sometimes you've just got to accept that some things die and somethings flourish. 


I also wish there would be a larger understanding of the history amongst current and future participants because these kind of stories just fade away into the background otherwise and reality becomes distorted. 

I was just thinking what would happen if Luke tried to censor Omni now by abusing his positition to push patches and how *nobody* would stand for it they would be calling for his head now that it's escrowing billions in value and facilitating trades between exchanges. Yet that's exactly what happened in the past !

It shouldn't be ignored.  I do hope it's covered in a book or movie someday haha"
Bcash is trash
Agree. I never owned BCH and didn’t think it was a great thing in general, but even I can see the BCH fork was VERY different from any other fork before. It’s the first and only fork to show up on coinbase, for example. That alone makes it stand out. 
I subbed here a couple of weeks ago because I thought btc was the bitcoin subreddit, its very entertaining though.
"Of course man. Makes me sick seeing what's happened to ""truth"" in crypto. The whole point of Crypto was supposed to be so that you didn't have to trust anyone, everything was supposed to be able to be proven factually, categorically. I don't think (m)any of us early enthusiasts could have foreseen that if you split the ideology at its center, you can divide and conquer the crypto world as well as anything else. So here we are, if you'll allow my American politics reference, where we are no more able to effectively achieve our goals, hopes, dreams, than the republicans and democrats are able to make America a worthwhile country for all its citizens. Amazing, that for all the harm and decadence of the republican party, they still run our country like it's child's play. And I think that is no mistake or coincidence, if you know anything about how intelligence agencies operate, you'll know that there is absolutely no chance they aren't heavily involved in what's going on here in our stupidly manipulable crypto scene."

About $80mil in December, not bad. Kill me?
it's a pity people now forget about it :S I used to watch that bubble on the charts all the time back in 2012
Or got addicted to drugs on the SR. I was so pissed when btc went to 10 a piece. Suddenly it was 3.5 btc for a bag of weed like wtf 
I would like to see surges and recoveries after this. I want so much data. Lol I wish I had a team 
FOMO come true. 
A correction is when the price overshoots and then comes back to a more stable value.
I heard about it in 2009 fml....
"3.5 btc for an eighth of nug at $35 per eighth and 10 per btc. At highest point that same bag of weed sold for 70k lol 

"
"Normally correction is just a 10%+ drop from the most recent high.

Crypto dudes just use it for whatever, they call every downward movement some random term"

I'm sorry for your loss.  It is important to understand when you own a bitcoin, and when you hold an IOU for a bitcoin.
That's no Bitcoin...
Why everybody wants to retire early (actually, not having to go to a shitty job for survival)? Because everyone is tired of working like slaves and paying taxes to sustain fake wars and corrupt politicians.

Yes I'm aware, I'm from Townsville. I'm asking where abouts in the city it was seen.
I'm right though. I checked with streetview. 
Nope, millions of people didnt.
Oh, I’m just in Lane Road, Local Neihbourbood, Earthland.
Specific, how do you know that?
you don't have private keys?  if that is what you are saying, i'm sorry to hear that.
over what? bitcoin? or the 100s of privacy coins? 
How insensitive. I live on Avenue Street in Townsville, Earthland, and I have never been more offended in my life.

Nah, Circle Pay never gave millions of users BCH.
I'm more than happy with my micra k11, but if i become a millionaire that baby is getting a engine upgrade :p
just my opinion. Reckon BTCP will take over. 
"Timor is the bastardization of the Malaysian *timur*, meaning east. Leste is Portuguese for ""east."" Therefore, Timor Leste is etymologically ""east east."""
"Nothing makes it bad. Someone will correct me if I’m wrong but I think Timor-Leste is translated to East-East.

They’re making fun of the name “Townsville”."
Wow. What a name. To any outsider (LIKE ME) it just seems like the most unoriginal name ever.
