"Well, a lot of first adopters are in it for the long haul, and they don't have an inconsiderable volume as it was easier to mine it back then. I am a little concerned with people who don't have a good knowledge of crypto and shout for government intervention or regulations to solve problems when cryptocurrency came into existence because centrally managed currencies have issues.

Back again to your point: Even if there's someone who's been into bitcoin a very long time, they may actually have no strategy involved in terms of buying and selling at a given price and are instead looking at it for the utility value of doing their business in the crypto. I believe a day will come when crypto is the predominant means of exchange. 

Learn about the technology first, and from there it's much easier, I hope."
"I appreciate the reply and explanation. From my own simple understanding of crytpo, i can take form it that it is mostly, if not, all are just short term investments (of course from an investment standpoint)

As you said i will need to ask around a bit as there seems to be so much i need to learn,,"
Do a little research on it. Lot of places thinking it can hit $30 by end of 2018. It’s at like $14 now.
