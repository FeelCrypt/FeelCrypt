"Sure, in an ideal world, people wouldn't downvote things they disagree with.  However, since there is no incentive to use your downvotes altruistically, the **vast** majority of users do not.

You misunderstood, downvoting is used to silence people instead of its intended use of keeping discussions on track. It’s literally in Reddit’s etiquette guidelines.
People can downvote for whatever reason they want. 
This is crazy guys. We need to rebrand. Calling ourselves Bitcoin is bringing great shame to our project. 
LOL Same shit happens here all the time. You guys flip the fuck out when anyone calls out this sub as a Bcash support forum. 
You don’t see how down voting which hides posts with polarising views creates a bias to one particular view? The fact that you’re using the down vote as a disagreement just adds to my point, you don’t want to see opinions different from yourself. How do feel about safe spaces?

"> I understand assets distributed to shareholders also need to be liquidated so taxes can be properly assessed.       
       
False. Bankruptcy liquidation is made till all creditors are been paid, afterwards, there is no more bankrupty and cort/trustee does not have any busines authority on corporation anymore, but ""new"" appointed ceo or proprietorship. So no court can force corporation to liquidate remaining intangible assets (btc+forks) in order to have possible corporate capital gains, what in turn are then shared with shareholders if they requested it (they can decide assets to remain in the corporation). Full asset are liquidated only in the case there is no enough funds to settle all creditors and these asset can't be sold partialy, but at full. (Btc as intangible asset can be sold as incriment or partialy as opposed to the other intangible assets: trademark, copyright, blueprint, internet domain, patent, software, trade secret, etc.).                 
Esentually,  major difference in CR from current bankruptcy is to allow remaining btc to be distributed to the creditors, not to be settled with curent claims 485$ btc evaluation + fiat exchanged and distributed as JPY what make bankruptcy completed, and not to remain as corporation untangible asset where shareholders can get trough dividends if liquidated. Actually, liqidated btc are first mtgox capital gain, corporate annual income taxed, then transfered to the Tibanne (not taxable as asset transfer is to the parent company) what can be further distributed to the Mark as a dividend payout as 100% Tibanne owner (if he want or he can leave it as Tibanne asset. Naturally, that to be possible, Tibanne must complete their bankruptcy). Btc as untangible assets does not make direct dividends or interest, but its capital gain what can be used either to increase corporation equity (investment) capital or as profit/loss eglible to the possible corporate annual income tax (if corporation have income (depend on loss and deductables) and then sent as dividends to the shareholders.       
      
Beside, even with current straight bankruptcy, trustee can address the court based on finance analysis and cuncil for new evaluations of intangible assets(btc) due to price violity and significant asset value increase, what if approved, with current straight bankrupty btc+forks must be sold to pay all creditors with updated and new evaluated claims. On another hand, only if CR and plan is approved, these btc and forks can be distributed unexchanged (unliquidated) to the creditors.
      
       
**Worst case scenario:** Court settle all creditors claim with current evaluated btc (483$) where only enough intangible assets (btc) are liquidated (sold) to settle all creditors (what are almost already done), what makes bunkruptcy completed and reamining 165k btc and forks remain as Mtgox intangible asset where they can do whatever they want, liquidate and pay dividends, trade with btc, invest in other projects etc (bankruptcy is over, no obligation or liabilities to MtGox creditors).       
**Little better scenario:** Court accept new btc evaluation, but then these to be paid, all (or better to say) suficient remaining btc need to be sold(liquidate) to settle new evaluated creditor claims and question is how much liquid asset (funds) creditors would receive due crushing the btc price. Eventual btc+forks surplus what would be significantly lower then in worst case scenario (btc+forks surplus would depend on new btc price evaluation for creditor claims and difference in new total claimed sum vs. what trustee get from actual btc liquidation), would remain as MtGox intangible asset, they can do whatever they want - bankruptcy is completed.               
**Best scenario:** Civil rehabilitation under supervision with approved plan where creditors can claim all remaining btc+ forks unexchanged (not liquidated) + what is already liquidated.     "

Thanking people for doing the right thing seems like a good precedent to me.
"I appreciate your confusion. The forum is for confirmed creditors. At the moment the only way we have of sifting actual creditors from timewasters is to ask for a contribution. That's a terrible way of doing it. So we were asking for help from people with a list of creditor email addresses, so that we can send them an invitation link for them to join for free. 

It's a fair to think, when viewed from the outside, that we've been pretty ineffectual. Filing for CR is a paper exercise that takes little to do. Actually it was a bit risky to file it so hastily, but it all worked out in the end. The real hard work was done canvassing Ito with powerful legal arguments from authorities (a former judge and a legal scholar). That work was done by our lawyer at our expense. Thankfully Ito recommended CR to the court. The next step is getting the court to accept HOW they can move from Bankruptcy to CR. Again we're canvassing Kobayashi (our laywers meet with him on Thursday) to work with him on an opinion to submit to the court. 

We're also working with the other legal team to get this opinion to the court. https://www.mtgoxlegal.com/2018/04/09/survey-for-fukuoka-sensei/
FYI, they aren't a creditor group, they are funded by one creditor, who is well intentioned and open to dialogue with us, but isn't looking to have creditors join them and share the decision making and information like we are.

Our lawyers have different styles and approaches. Both in turn have helped advance the cause of creditors. It doesn't matter to me which one wins, as long as creditors win.

In practice the foundations for the decisions on how CR will eventually be managed are being set now. That's why I'd like more creditors involved in the dialogue of how we do that. Our co-operative is set up to drive the process through participatory decision making, debate and information sharing."
"Fair points and the revolutionary and unknown outcomes are certainly one of the challenges regarding regulation.  But we don't have to know how the eco system will end up.  We need to understand the concerns (and mandates) of regulators and address them.  Or at least acknowledge them and signal to regulators ""chill dudes, this thing is nascent and evolving rapidly so we don't know quite what the finished product is, but we recognise your regulatory concerns and will put in place self and inherent (code) regulation that will address those.""  A regulator hearing this narrative will be far more likely to let Bitcoin grow before stomping in with hard rules.  We need time, not knee-jerk, politically motivated reactions from regulators.  "
"I think you've got a pretty good head on your shoulders.

I suppose the only flaw in your approach is that I'm not really sure even the revolutionary vanguard of cryptocurrencies are entirely sure at what its disruption is actually going to look like and so sometimes these arguments are legitimately people trying to understand what will be possible so they can understand if this is good or bad. 

I mean, I could come up with a number of arguments for why a decentralized world currency might be disastrous. I mean it does suggest that capitalism would become unstoppable -- and while I think capitalism is generally a better system than any others, I'm not willing to suggest it has no flaws and no concerns. Like anything man-made, there are problems. "

REEEEE MY BRAND
"I may be wrong, after a bit of a search. I think I mixed up a few points - Cobra has been pointing out the inconsistencies in -core's 'logic' recently, and the (maybe previous) legitimate holder of the @bitcoin twitter handle had also seen the issues with -core's stance and had been using the account to point these out, seemingly having switched allegiances to Bitcoin Cash. The similarities between these two things seems to have created some confusion in my mind.

Whoever was the holder of that handle, it should be returned to them. Its suspension, deletion and apparent re-registration as a private handle is simply wrong."
We would gain quite a lot, as all the infrastructure that was built up around BTC when it actually followed the white paper would have to actually make a choice about which path to follow rather than just be complacent and get stuck with SegwitCoin.
I would prefer if they did this, they've stolen the Bitcoin name with their soft dork.
"I agree that it's a brand, the real issue in question is who is the owner. In my mind, it's just an internet free-for-all and that's what it's got to be in this decentralized world. There's (rightfully) no foundation or official leadership organization that can claim ownership, so there's really no legitimacy, IMHO, to disputing the usage of the name as a scam because you disagree with the account owner's interpretation of what bitcoin is.

One group (or individual) owns bitcoin.com, another bitcoin.org, another @bitcoin, and another owns the github repo. These people or groups don't all agree on what is or isn't bitcoin, and thats _fine_. That's part of the beauty (and sometimes curse) of a decentralized network.

Personally I agree with the idea that we shouldn't confuse people and try to call bitcoin cash bitcoin. (at least) two groups disagreed about the direction the coin should go, and both created changes to it to suit their needs. One of these groups is larger and owns the github repo, so I think it's fine that they get to keep the name ""bitcoin"", but that doesn't give them the right to refuse anyone else use it. In order to reduce confusion, someone came up with the idea to add ""cash"" to the end of one of the versions to emphasize it's purpose and ideology. I honestly don't think either ideology is more right than the other, and I think it's counterproductive to try to argue what Satoshi would do in a world that he didn't and couldn't predict (tons of altcoins, corporate interest, speculative trading, etc). It's like arguing who Tupac's favorite modern rapper would be."

"> for the impersonation report spamming

meaning ""core trolls"" are spamming Twitter's reporting mechanisms to try to get @bitcoin banned

> Jack Dorsey conspiracy

Idea that Twitter CEO stole @bitcoin due to his recent investment in Lightning Labs 

I was just saying there's as much proof for the purchase violation as for either of the popular theories as to what happened. It's all circumstantial and supposition at this point (though obviously some give more weight to one than to the other based on their own ideological slant)"
"> Even more than other spaces. Afterall, sales of very high reputation accounts were even sanctioned by Theymos (even if discussion of that was only allowed in the very hidden ""meta"") in the main discussion space of years back (bitcointalk).

Not sure why that's relevant. Each community can have its own standards. Twitter's is to suspend your account. "
"> Hubs are a fiction entirely created by Lightning detractors.

Yeah, of course. [Hubs are just fiction](https://lnmainnet.gaben.win). 😅

>These may also be hidden.

Read the article.

>Another step developers plan to look into in the long term, he said, is making both components - the marketplaces and the watchtowers - invisible to bitcoin users.

>""Ideally within our application, this is all abstracted away from the end user,"" Osuntokun said, though he added the goal is still to make it easy for ""power users"" with more tech experience to construct and run their own towers.

>But if the Lightning Network becomes the go-to channel for everyday bitcoin transactions, this vigilance would become quite burdensome. As such, the watchtower concept allows users to outsource the ""eternal vigilance"" to other entities, who will send users a message should something look awry.

Since Lightning Network can't scale on-chain and become trustless, they have to outsource that to a third party. It destroys the point of the blockchain in the first place. Bitcoin was invented to circumvent the third party.

So now we have a sidechain where it is coded into the protocol that third parties will get paid to surveil the network. But you said it won't ""invade your privacy""! Obviously a hub will have enough power of itself to surveil, but nothing wrong with just controlling and surveilling your own channels. 

>False. Lightning runs on top of and requires Bitcoin. It can remove nothing, but it can (and does) add value.

LN piggybacks and steals profits and censorship resistance given from miners. If it didn't, why wouldn't we just have one miner mining and do all of our transactions on LN, since all it does is just ""add value"".

>False. The user would just force close the channel and receive their funds back. There is also nothing stopping them from opening additional channels to other nodes (or even merchants directly).

So you believe that LN won't turn into a centralized system controlled by a few actors who obviously provide KYC and whatever else the government or banks want?  Given it doesn't turn out to be complete vaporware of course?  But I can give you that it might not be that easy to reverse transactions, for that you would need to fork. But transactions are already irreversible onchain, so no news there.

> False. Every full node verifies that nobody creates new bitcoin except by the pre-defined rules. Fractional reserve banking is impossible on Bitcoin, unless the rules change to allow it (I would never allow such a thing, even if that means my node splits from the rest of the network).

Maybe you should read up on the definition? 

**Fractional-reserve banking is the practice whereby a bank accepts deposits, makes loans or investments, but is required to hold reserves equal to only a fraction of its deposit liabilities.**

Just because I go into a bank that practices fractional-reserve banking and owns 1 dollar and they give me 10 dollars doesn't mean that they **exist**. That is the whole point of it. They are lending you money that doesn't exist, and they are allowed to because..? 

>Can you explain how exactly unbacked USDT makes BTC fractional reserve? That makes zero sense.

I guess I should have said blockchain and not Bitcoin. I used Tether as an example, and using USD instead of BTC wouldn't change much. 

It isn't possible to do fractional reserve banking on the layer itself since every transaction on LN is a **potential** transaction onchain, so you would need to do another layer (which seems plausible). 

There will however be a slight problem when people want to be a part of the new hub and they suddenly don't get to control the private keys, or when the LN hubs suddenly starts issueing IOUs, like checks and whatnot. Going to your local hub and asking for a check to pay for things would be convinient when the on-chain transaction costs approaches $100 USD. 😅

Yes but the argument here is that bitcoin referred to a coin which is more accurately (subjectively) reflected in BCH. Twitter is essentially taking a side here. Which one is closer to Satoshi's coin? That's a debate isnt it?
"You harm the person that thinks you're selling them something but instead you sell them something else. 

Just like if you say you're selling bananas but instead you sell rocks, the buyer might get pissed at you. No trademark needed. "
"The account is back. 

'Other people' such as Twitter should not be taking a stance in this debate. I'm guessing it was suspended due to repeated reporting by Core trolls. "
"Or any chain, most likely. 

So if we take the ""most closely resembles the original"" argument as the most important one, Bitcoin is effectively dead and has been for years. "
">I know you will respond with concern trolling about roger and bitcoin.com

Or, you know, the Twitter account we're discussing.

And I wouldn't say I'm morally offended, I just think that BCH (or at least some very vocal supporters of it) is clearly trying to leech off of the success of Bitcoin.

Why would it be so important to claim to be the original if was technically superior?

I don't see ads from car manufacturers selling their cars as being more similar to the Ford model T than the competition. "
I don't, why does that matter? Can't you address my arguments directly? 
To me, as a blockchain dev (as well as Vitalik even), bitcoin cash not only deserves the name... but most likely the title too.
"Which one?

Edit: when I visit coinbase.com/charts I'm presented with a drop-down that includes BTC and BCH. No descriptive names and as such no way to say that either one is the one and only Bitcoin.

But regardless, different sites apply different names. Some call Bitcoin Core by it's full name. Most still call it Bitcoin. Some call Bitcoin Cash Bcash despite that not being its name or even the name of any project related to it. 

So what someone may choose to call it doesn't make it so. "
Thanks for the explanation, and I agree. Locking up funds to send funds doesn't really makes sense for any entity (companies or users), regardless of their will to put up with the system. 
"I'll bring ya back up to 1 ;)

I think that argument is speaking more to the spirit of Bitcoin. We can all spit back and forth about what Satoshi intended, but I think considering his basic intention and what spurred his innovation, off-chain solutions shouldn't be the primary transaction element. They intended from early on for larger blocks to be necessary and even Core developers have also said that eventually they will be. But only with 'agreement'. =/"
"> Why would it be so important to claim to be the original if was technically superior?

It's not, the only people making a big deal about the name are core supporters like you. Bitcoin cash is just doing what it's always done, try and fulfill the vision satoshi laid out in the white paper.

When you fork a technology you don't abandon its roots, you grow from the point of the fork onwards. The only people making a big deal about the name are people like yourself. It kind of worries me how little you seem to understand about this space and the history of the technology. You are meeting a technical argument with a political argument. "
Vitalik doesn't have the same issue with his coin of the offshoot trying to steal the brand of the original. They are clear and separate and don't try to compete with each other as it should be.

"Yes, eventually blocks will be bigger, when all the big efficiency improvements are gone and we still need to scale. 

Doing it the other way around means increased infrastructure costs earlier and more resistance by companies/users to adopt more efficient methods when it starts to get bad because ""why not raise the blocksize again instead?"".

I don't think the Lightning Network is at odds with the original spirit of Bitcoin, it's still a limited supply that can't be controlled. Satoshi himself talked about payment channels, which LN is based on."
"Yes, exactly. It should not be suspended, and I really hope they don't give it to someone else.

Personally I think people pushing the bch is btc angle is a waste of time. Eventually somethings gotta pop. "
">It's not, the only people making a big deal about the name are core supporters like you.

You must be joking, the only times this is even discussed is because a BCH supporter is claiming that BCH is Bitcoin and not just Bitcoin Cash.

>Bitcoin cash is just doing what it's always done, try and fulfill the vision satoshi laid out in the white paper.

I don't remember massive and buggy changes to the difficulty adjustment algorithm being part of Satoshi's vision. It also violates the whitepaper's description of Bitcoin, but BCH supporters prefer to ignore that part.

>The only people making a big deal about the name are people like yourself.

No, it's the ones that keep trying to claim the Bitcoin name for Bitcoin Cash.

>You are meeting a technical argument with a political argument. 

How is naming a technical argument? Does the name provide any technical advantages or disadvantages that I'm unaware of? "
"I know. I'm sorry forks confuse you. Those of limited intellect seem to have this problem. 

Think of it like a Star Trek [transporter duplicate](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Transporter_duplicate). The original goes in. And out come two identical (or slightly different) copies. From that point forward, there are two, not one and the original is gone. 

You may choose to name one after the original, but it's entirely subjective. "
I know exactly what it is and that's exactly my point, it isn't trying to be the main ethereum coin. It's a deviation from the main fork and doesn't try to convince people that it's any different. This is the opposite of bitcoin cash. I don't have a problem with using the name bitcoin but trying to say it's the original and primary bitcoin to confuse and I would say steal the market is the problem. 
I’m gonna think about it like identical twins.  The zygote develops as a single entity, then it splits.  Each twin now has identical genes, but sometimes one will pretend to be the other so it can fuck its sibling’s spouse.
Who is saying this?  The name is very clear about it, and ultimately it's still closer to the bitcoin from the last 8 years which is why people may be confused by any of this.
"That works too.

Edit: but for the analogy to work in terms of which one is Bitcoin, you'd have to have named the zygote Bitcoin before it split."
"are you serious that you don't get this perspective? Lets not play with each others intelligence. Just in this article, it discusses a bitcoin cash user/holder taking the @bitcoin name to talk bad about bitcoin to promote bitcoin cash to the point that twitter had to lock the name and (I assume) transfer the name to it's rightful owners. What reddit sub are we one again? who owns bitcoin.com (but not bitcoincash.com)? lets not insult each by playing stupid games.   
  
to address your other point, what you say may be true that the original intention may have been more like the current intention of bch. I would say this is a valid reason to fork and if you prefer those earlier intentions than by all means promote bch. This does not mean that btc is not the primary bitcoin. It may have adapted and changed to current market forces or because of internal business decisions or whatever reason. It's the norm for a business to change directions to adapt to the market. It's still disingenuous and I would say illegal to steal the name brand of of the original bitcoin. it's not and should not try to pretend it's the original bitcoin. It's an offshoot that may be trying to go back to the original intents of the founders of bitcoin. If this was the official bch slogan and outcry, I would be behind it 100% but it's not. It claims that it's the original bitcoin and tries to confuse people through shady tactics into believing that it's the original brand. It's not. that should be ok but it's not enough to carry the ledger of the original it needs to try and steal it's brand as well. If crypto wasnt the wild west and more like a corporation, It would get sued out of business for these market tactics. "
Lol no its name was originally Jose.  I just call the other one JosB.
"It's open source, bitcoin.com also has tons of information and features for Bitcoin, as well as its sister, Bitcoin Cash.  Twitter is a cesspool period, so basing anything on that is a big disingenuous.  Bitcoin is not a trademark.  Bitcoin Cash is an offshoot, **with a different name**.  It's not calling itself bitcoin.

https://twitter.com/jihanwu/status/928756075108511744?lang=en

Even Jihan Wu (who people apparently hate?) specifically says it's not to be confused with ""Bitcoin"" itself, it is Bitcoin Cash.

I mean if you want to pull twitter examples out, everyone believes Jihan has a serious voice (I don't know much about him) but many people are very aware that it is a fork, **with a different name** and the original vision.

If it were trying to be ""Bitcoin"", everyone would try to force the original ticker symbol, but it's not, it's entirely separate."
I'm pulling relevant facts -- from the article that this thread is about. Again, as I said before, I have no problem with using bitcoin in the name as it's is a fork. My problem is in bch trying to steal the brand of bitcoin in an attempt to gain popularity and market share (and in unscrupulous ways) to make a false claim that it is the true and/or original bitcoin. It's not. This is fake news 101. Making the claim twitter is a cesspool is a strawman argument. It is another example of bch trying to usurp btc. bitcoin is not a trademark becuase crypto is the wild west. bitcoin cash is a different name bit tries very hard to minimize or even directly hide the cash part of the name just as it tries to minimize the name bitcoin for the original by calling it bcore or core whatever other variable without actually saying bitcoin. I don't know anything about Jihan Wu so I can't comment on any direction of him but if bch was clear that it's a fork with a different name than I would be behind this 100% but it's clearly not the community or bch leadership position to do this. It has originally tried to usurp the btc symbol when it forked but failed repeatedly across the different exchanges because of said confusion. This is recent history.  
There is no CEO of Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash, for anyone to say that is a joke... so anybody can literally say anything about bitcoin cash, it doesn't speak for the entire community when a few people say something.  So be mad at them, not bitcoin cash itself.  It wasn't trademarked because it's open source with a free and open license.
The general community is what I am talking about and although there may not be a specific ceo - there are definite figureheads, definite developers and definite spokesman that speak and guide the community for the coins such as roger V for bch, Charlie Lee for ltc and Andreas Antonopoulos for bitcoin so again lets not play stupid with each other. This shouldn't even need to be said. 
What do you think Ethereum Classic is?  They took the name too because it's the same original base code and chain database...  Bitcoin Cash wants to be the cash version of bitcoin, not the gold version.  So it's real clear, right in the title of the new coin.
Most of it can be automated and hidden... Problem is though, that it will always be more efficient to do this in a centralized manner. Regardless of it's technical issues or merits, it doesn't make any economic sense to use LN for one-to-one transactions. There is a true cost in locked up funds and transactional complexity. Bitcoin has mostly social and adoption challenges, not technical ones. LN makes the this situation even worse.
I don't get the argument, you don't have to use those features and they are still within the consensus rules that you agreed to. 
I've never understood why it couldn't be like eth and etc. In fact, I think bitcoin classic would be far better too.
I don't see how that works.  If no one owns a trademark, how can anyone be harmed?
"It's obvious just from basic paying attention and common sense that bch is trying to steal the identity of bitcoin. When bch calls themselves ""bitcoin cash"" and tries to call the original - ""bcore"" or just core that they are trying to steal the brand. Just by using the same ledger, they are trying to steal and convert the user base. When whomever originally had the twitter handle only had it to disparage bitcoin as an attempt to upsell bch -it should be revoked and it should be transferred to the correct bitcoin. It's the same as when someone bought a web domain of an already existing company because they were first to profit off of it in the early days of the web but now there is a process to get the web domain to the rightful company or owner. It's the same with twitter handles of famous people that now celebrities have to get a verified tag to point out that it is who it's intended to be and not a fake attempting to masquerade with a fake name to troll or impersonate. "
">I'm the proof you're wrong

...one paragraph later...

> Those who sell BCH are very clear that it is NOT THE SAME as BTC. What we do tell noobs is that in all likelihood BCH more accurately represents the qualities of Bitcoin that they are interested in.
"
It is a brand and I'm not arguing ownership (trademark). Why is every reply so defensive about who owns the brand? I'm not the OP claiming that, just saying here that its stupid to not call bitcoin a brand.
Which has a program (and brand) named BitTorrent made on it's protocol, just like there are other brands like uTorrent running on that client . Same then can be said for blockchain as a protocol and Bitcoin as it's program, so yes there is a brand for bitcoin, and I'm not arguing who owns it.
Not arguing that. Just saying there is a brand.
People running nodes with 4 year old software still follow the BTC chain because it didn't break any of the consensus rules. 
"I see. Yes I agree. 

I don't agree with your perception of @bitcoin ""switch"" considering how Roger ""switch"" was around the same time as mine and for the same reason (i.e. death of the NY agreement)."
They won't let you keep the account. 
wow, LN sounds like garbage.
"Bitcoin has evolved over time like any other technology does. 

I don't think it matters if it's closer to the original design or not, just like I don't care if my car is similar to the first automobiles or not.

You can use the initial client from 2009, that would be the truest Bitcoin by your definition, but you probably wouldn't like the experience. "
">The fact that you think bitcoin is a brand like McDonald's speaks volumes about why you are in this space in the first place.

I didn't say it was like it, they're clearly different, but in the context of this conversation I don't think the differences are important.

>Bitcoin is not a brand, it's a technology and you cannot control it.

It's both. It's a brand in the same way Banana is a brand. It's not legally registered but it's still a name that people recognize and associate with a specific product/item. 

And no, you can't control it but people also don't have to accept your use of the brand. There's simply no owner of the brand and no one can take you to court for your use of it.

>The fact that you try and make this a moral issue is even funnier. Go concern troll somewhere else.

If I want to buy bananas and you sell me oranges while claiming you're selling me bananas, I might get pissed.

Banana isn't a registered trademark.
Orange isn't a registered trademark.
And yet no one will think what you're doing is ok and most people will agree that you're defrauding me. "

"When the codebase and chain *are* bitcoin-based, why wouldn't it share a similar name?  That's like saying Xubuntu (xfce fork) and Kubuntu (KDE fork) shouldn't have used ""ubuntu"" in its name.  This is how open source works.  Many projects have ""flavors"" that share the name so you know the origin of the software."
"BCH and BTC are both forks of Bitcoin, and as such, both are Bitcoin. I have never claimed otherwise. There is no ""one true Bitcoin"". Not anymore. "
Well we can agree on that then. 
"Fair enough, I don't disagree.

This civil war really sucks ass.  Core should have just encouraged a clean, friendly two way split between the ideologies.  This civil war is only going to get worse and the winner will be altcoins"
That's why soft forks are so insidious, no one got asked, new features were added that no one agreed to.
It's even possible that Twitter received report spam about it being bought, even if that wasn't true, which seems a lot more actionable than the impersonation claim. I think we're entering a new age of the Internet where service providers are extremely knee-jerky.
For sure, but the point is that Twitter has taken it upon themselves to manifest their opinion in this debate through action. I'm of the opinion that in the absence of a trademark dispute, it is an arbitrary exercise of their authority. Granted it is their website and they can do what they want, but it should be seen as an attempt to lend credibility to their favored position. 
The irony is you wouldn't be able to transact on the core Bitcoin chain with it, right?
"> If I want to buy bananas and you sell me oranges while claiming you're selling me bananas, I might get pissed.

This isn't happening. I know you will respond with concern trolling about roger and bitcoin.com but no one cares because it ignores the entire history of what took place and the fact that there are very good reasons for claiming bitcoin cash adheres to the original vision. But you're going to ignore those things so you can act morally offended. You are shouting into the wind. Go put your time into something worthwhile."
Do you have any other examples of accounts being suspended for this? Because I think you're just making this up as you go along.
"I don't have a problem with forking. I have a problem the offshoot disingenuously trying to usurp and minimize the main prong via shady tactics in an attempt to steal its market cap of its primary source. Linux is a terrible example because Linux tries to be free and open source while crypto is the exact opposite. It's a unit of value. Part of that value comes from its market brand and name brand recognition. This is why you don't hear bch saying ""we are an offshoot but now distinct and separate"" instead you here ""we are the original intention of BITCOIN and should be treated as such!"""
Hey, real quick, what’s the USD price of Bitcoin right now on Coinbase?

idk, it seems more logical to me than a report brigade or the LN investment conspiracy. 
mfw 4chan is the only viable social media platform.
What do you expect them to do. Roger bot that Twitter account to promote his alts misleading users, they have the authority to ban that action. When police arrest a guy selling fake watches. Do you call that censorship? 
Hahaha what a cry baby. Do yourself a favor and read twitters ToS. Misrepresenting a product and being shady either online or otherwise is kind of frowned upon by everyone. For many reasons.

Yes, you're right - OP is a fucking scumbag for posting an article with a conclusion for the title that was never in the original article, and accusing someone of a theft with no evidence. Also for lying about Jack's investment amount - it's a group of 11 investors totaling $2.5M, and we don't know how much of that was Jack's part.

Good lord, who actually read the article. Everyone is commenting on /u/scotty321's title, not the article itself. When you argue about a conclusion that the article never raises, you just make yourself look dumb. 
Jack Dorsey hasn't bothered to study LN.
"No, Jack Dorsey didn't make a $2.5M investment. 

> The company is announcing today that it has raised $2.5 million in seed funding to date from numerous big names in payments and beyond, including Square and Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey,  Square exec Jacqueline Reses, serial-founder-turned investor David Sacks, Litecoin creator Charlie Lee, Eventbrite co-founder Kevin Hartz, BitGo CTO Ben Davenport and Robinhood co-founder Vlad Tenev, along with The Hive, Digital Currency Group and others.

That means he was part of a group. I'm sure he invested more than $1, but the article **does not** say he invested $2.5M. 

I mean, if we're just going to link to something and then make the title say whatever we want regardless of what the article says, might as well just make all links rick rolls."
The title is completely misleading. reported!

Oh man, you mean to tell me that Twitter isn't run by free market libertarians who want p2p electronic cash?
"So let me get this right. Jack Dorsey, worth $3.4B, and CEO of a $21B market cap company, is willing to undermine users' trust due to conflict of interest for an investment of up to $2.5M? (there were 10 other investors in that group, BTW; we don't know Jack's share) Has he done the same for Twitter users that compete with his other investments, most of which were far greater than $2.5M? (https://www.crunchbase.com/person/jack-dorsey/investments/investments_list)"

Completely agree with this comment. While we are at the dawn of great block chain based projects. We will soon see new social media platforms where information is completely owned by the user and not the company.
How pretentious does one have to be to write what you just did
The problem with this is that even the centralised ones are plagued by trolling,  bullying and spam. Keeping an uncontrolled, decentralised one usable sounds like a NP-hard problem.
There are promising platforms already, check out https://peepeth.com/welcome . Just waiting on about a years worth of improvements to the underlying blockchain and they'll be ready to replace the incumbents.
Redditor /u/alexiglesias007 has low karma in this subreddit.
GnuSocial and Mastodon might be the best options we have right now. It's not entirely decentralized but it's at least federated so you're not beholden to one central authority.
Good bot.
Yours.org is going to do that. They developing a website plugin which lets you tip theoretically everything on the web in BCH. Can't wait for that.

Anyone that read the article would know that the conclusion OP made wasn't in the article. So either someone didn't read the article and is only commenting on OP's title, or read the article and is struggling with reading comprehension.
But no one owns a trademark for Bitcoin... Right?
"Two people in the space have claimed they know him and is someone from 2009. I have no reason to doubt at least one of those persons. I do agree it would be uncommon in the space. 

Even more than other spaces. Afterall, sales of very high reputation accounts were even sanctioned by Theymos (even if discussion of that was only allowed in the very hidden ""meta"") in the main discussion space of years back (bitcointalk).

As soon as they forked they became a competitor. By retaining the name (and ledger) they intend to impersonate the original product with the offshoot brand.

Hilarious, talking about hijacking, thats exactly what Bcash tries to do with the Bitcoin brand. Jack Dorsey knows this (because he investigated crypto before investing in LN) and don't want scammers on his platform that mislead users of Twitter, so he suspends the account. Makes sense right? Reddit should have done this long time ago already with r/btc
Yeah, where the f is the decentralized Twitter?
Lol. Reminds me of the Greek philosophers who were executed for creating debate and telling truths.
A successful brigading attack by r-bitcoin. We can hope that twitter will lift the suspension when they know the details, but I'm not hopeful, and I fear that cobra has lost his twitter handle.
"Most likely because it was impersonating Bitcoin while actually promoting Bitcoin Cash.

That against the terms of use, rightfully so. That's what the ""we are gifting 5000ETH"" scammer accounts do, they impersonate popular accounts to gain credibility."
"Because it was trying to convince people that Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin, using the original orange right-tilted logo and everything.

It's as if Burger King had the McDonald's Twitter account and used it the same way, they would have been suspended as well. "
"BCH was already dead.

It was only the cultists that kept it pumped for long enough."
"> The company is announcing today that it has raised $2.5 million in seed funding to date from numerous big names in payments and beyond, including Square and Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey.

Jack Dorsey is participating in seed funding for LN? - True

Jack Dorsey is the CEO of Twitter? - True

@Bitcoin handle on twitter is anti LN? - True

Twitter just confiscated the @Bitcoin handle and gave it to somebody else? - True

**FUCKING DISCUSTINGLY CORRUPT?** - True"
"> For violating the ToS condition against impersonation.

I doubt it, since to impersonate, it has to be a legal entity. (ie person or business) Bitcoin is software. 

It is however, against the rules to buy or sell Twitter accounts, which I think we'll all agree is how @bitcoin became so pro-BCH.

"I knew if I scrolled far enough down I’d find some sensible peeps.   

Truly the BCH gene pool has been poisoned by some kind of really bad acid. And then some kind of MK Ultra type experiment was attempted on them to reprogram the brain into believing that something that hasn’t even existed for 1 year yet is the original of an 9 year old project. 

But the experiment was incomplete and those that survived became frustrated and angry by the truth they find so difficult to swallow.  "
I agree. That's one thing that HN does a really good job of. 
"Saying Bitcoin Cash is ""hijacking"" or ""impersonating"" the name ""Bitcoin"" is like saying the different distros of Linux ""hijack"" or ""impersonate"" Linux. Complete nonsense."
"Honestly none, other than circumstantial: Roger publicly bought bitcoin.com, and @bitcoin switched pretty quickly to becoming a primary source of BCH PR. Perhaps it was a totally organic switch, but it really didn't feel that way. 

Regardless, there's as much proof of that being the source of the suspension as there is for the impersonation report spamming or Jack Dorsey conspiracy. "
Well, do you really think the current operator of @bitcoin was the original registrar of the account/username?

"> Ethereum's orphan work is not wasted.

That depends on how you define ""waste"".

Miners mining uncles gets rewarded, and uncle rewards make the network stronger against attacks.  In that blog entry from 2014, Buterin asserts the network should work fine even with a 95% uncle rate.

That was his theory back in 2014, fast-forward to 2017 and things have actually been stress-tested, and the community find a 30% uncle rate as problematic.  Geographical location still plays a big part in reward distribution.  Uncles costs resources as they should be propagated, validated, rewarded and archived - their contribution to the transactional bandwidth of the network is negative.

> the state of fast ETH confirmations is not quite as [bad] as the comment suggests.

This is based on my own experiences, during the most congested times.  Of course things varies dependent on what wallet software was used and weather the the sender is trying to save on the fees or not - but in general, the probability that an outbound ethereum transaction will fail is very much higher than the probability that a BCH transaction will fail - and for the ordinary users, I believe it's harder to relate to ""gas price"" and ""gas limit"" than ""fee pr byte"" or ""fee"".

"Not who you replied to, but one difference is the staking itself. With mining, we see that miners can immediately sell the coin thru mine for either fiat or another coin so while they do have incentive to profit, that doesn't mean they need to support a coin long term if thier hardware will work on other chains.

With dash or similar staking coins, the masternode operators have a lot of capital locked up in the master node itself, so in order to vote in something ""bad"" they are risking a lot more.

Another issue with PoW miners that work on multiple chains is that a large miner could easily switch to a smaller chain briefly to ""attack"" it, whereas that is theoretically less profitable if bad actors have to buy at market rate to stake a coin"
Sure, but that doesn't solve the problem Mike's taking about
"Proof of manipulation?

Bitcoin was overvalued around 2014 as well. It's probably natural."
I just disagree. I don't think people act rationally a lot of times, and the miners showed this to Mike Hearn when they talked with him. Lisk already has problems and it's delegated PoS.
">Any forms of voting that don't require skin in the game are inherently flawed. Only by committing resources to build a block can we ensure that most miners will call a committed vote according to their actual interests.

Would you not consider staking to be ""skin in the game""?"
"Hard to argue with anything you said here.  Good objective post.  Refreshing to read someone articulate both sides of the argument yet root their statement in fact.  

I agree, I think the penalty is way harsh all things considered.  But when looking strictly through the eyes of the law, he could have gotten worse.  Don’t quote me on this, but I think there’s certain states (or maybe even federal) laws that allow a death sentence to be imposed on the head of a continuing criminal enterprise that grosses over 10m a year.
