Tax nightmare if your from the US but could probably claim some decent losses with all those ICOs
  Bitcoin can handle only seven transactions a second (against Visa’s ten thousand), for instance, all because of an explicit hard limit on the amount of data that can go into a transaction block. That limit will need to be raised significantly if the system is to be expanded to include all these other value exchanges in addition to bitcoin payments.   Almost all is tethered to Bitcoin in some capacity, following what Bitcoin does in the medium term. It’s this consistent observation that should be shaping our portfolios. Bitcoin should be treated as the core coin. The one we turn to. Due to btc I ve got to know about the platform which totally suits my need because of fast tps - Credits. The coin to help realize our dream of an incorruptible and technologically advanced transfer of value from citizen to citizen, without the needless bloat. 
No, thanks!
Paging /u/Serhack have you seen this?

that's the stuff! this is EXACTLY how it peels off. one thing to note with this material is that it is not durable in applications where it exposed to abrasion, for example on the back of a cellphone that's in and out of your pocket.

"Sounds like bitcoin when it was no longer a ""instant low fee internet currency"" and became a ""store of value"" and dropped literally everything that gave it the initial value. Sounds scammy?"

"> Their aim was to provide higher transaction speeds and lower fees than the original Bitcoin Core (BTC).

It is interesting to note that bitcoin was originally designed with ~~marge~~ large block.

It is Bitcoin core that made changes that led to the split."

"Usually it has more level headed followers here. Bit-core-ians don't like it when you tell them facts about the science project that is 'The Lightning Network' and how it might as well be a bank on centralised hubs. Yet when the chain split we were the ones that was falsely claimed a 'centralised' system. 

It's hard to take them seriously when they can't see through the smoke and see the fire."

Why would you not?
No edge scuffs, the person who scratched it clearly didnt mind the sticker so much as what the sticker *said.*  they only scratched out the logo and words.  Fresh new sticker below highlights this beautifully.

Samson Mow was in town...
you support Bitcoin Cash but don't support vandals? Too bad neither require your approval.
then why only scratch out the bitcoin cash part and its logo? :D also other stickers on that street sign were left intact.
They focused only on the logo and words.  The anger was directed at what was on the sticker. Not the fact that it was even there. 
"TIL a sticker is ""vandalism"" 🙄"
It's really a conundrum but to sell your asset because you read it in a public board is just stupid...

BCH retains the fixed 21M supply.  you will lose.
"That’s what the masses care about. That’s what it take for large scale world wide adoption. Get your head outta you ass.

"> If you only think bitcoin is about having low fees you are sorely mistaken.

I think you need to re-read this thread:

https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=994.msg12168#msg12168

When BTC was worth $0.06 the suggested fee for large transactions was 0.01 BTC (0.06 * 0.01) = **$0.0006, or six one-hundredths of one cent, TOTAL.**

Satoshi said of the limit:

>I think it should be lowered to 50KB per block.  That would still be **more than 100 times the average transactions per block.**

So there we have a general framework that the blocksize was designed to be ""more than 100 times the average transactions per block."" Although IMO the limit being around 5 to 10 times the average would be more than enough now."

Looks public to me based upon the photo ... are you suggesting that someone broke into the OP property and scratched this sticker?
Seriously? You don't see why I wrote that? And in case you didn't notice, you had replies already.
"""explain why you are wrong"".. in my opinion, this is where you reveal yourself wanting to be spiteful and confronting. r/Bitcoin has become culty if that is what you mean."
Read the FAQ, it covers what happened to btc and the censorship that goes on. You can try it yourself, go post something about bch on r/bitcoin and see how long it stays up(or say somthing about pro-bch on twitter and see how long before you start getting brigaded by trolls). Using both btc and bch is also an easy way to see how much faster and cheaper bch is. I'm sure you have read plenty on r/bitcoin about how bch is a scam and roger ver is evil, as I used to read that stuff too. After the crazy fees happened and 2x was called off, I began to question why the bitcoin crowd spent so much time bashing bch. There are hundreds of scam coins, but nothing can get them riled up like mentioning bch. 
"I never said bitcoin shouldnt have low fees. Its just that I believe 2nd layer solutions will keep fees low and I dont believe on-chain scaling can 1) keep fees low, 2) keep bitcoin decentralized, permissionless and possible to check for everyone. No more gatekeepers.

> That's essentially why it was created

Did you read satoshis message in the genesis block? "
> The threshold can easily be changed in the future.  We can decide to increase it when the time comes.  It's a good idea to keep it lower as a circuit breaker and increase it as needed.  If we hit the threshold now, it would almost certainly be some kind of flood and not actual use.  Keeping the threshold lower would help limit the amount of wasted disk space in that event.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is a hard fork of the original Bitcoin. Their aim was to provide higher transaction speeds and lower fees than the original Bitcoin Core (BTC). Its working great for them but I have a feeling that the new BTC Lightning network will make BCH obsolete. (Just my opinion).
If you only think bitcoin is about having low fees you are sorely mistaken.
*large blocks
If you pay attention, only the logo and words are scratched.  If you put it over the last one, you lose the effect that someone didnt mind the sticker (edges intact except near words) so much as what the sticker *said*, which makes the message stronger.  You want someone to pay attention? Make it known there are people trying to keep this message from reaching them.
Felt better this way.
Compromised in functionality. Politically I don't know. But alas, it is kind of stupid. Luckily crypto is 100% free market competition. 
"It was. You should do some serious reading on it. Bitcoin Cash forked from Bitcoin after years of people saying the ""temporary"" 1MB block size cap needed to be removed. It's not a big deal really, this is how Bitcoin was designed to work. If the current devs aren't listening to what people want, anyone can fork and if enough mining support moves along with it another coin can stick around."
"The original bitcoin experienced a 45 day period of $10 median fees this winter, and it was celebrated by the developers. Do you want to support people who (intentionally or not) are celebrating the destruction of one of the primary properties of bitcoin, that of it being ""electronic cash""?"
u/cryptochecker
"People actually do, though. Anyone with a bank account who makes purchases with a debit card is using a system not unlike what the Lightning Network entails to be.

And that's why what Core have done is sinister. They're taking a technology that was meant to work outside the banking system and turning it into the next banking system in order to keep banks relevant. And this wasn't done by having free and open discussion. This is being accomplished due to a hostile takeover of the Bitcoin project."
It's essentally correct. Bitcoin became something other than bitcoin when the developers added their brain-farts to it. Bitcoin cash is the original and proven bitcoin.
I remember when people said that about our view on the banks back in the <$1 days. C'est la vie.
Lol?
Have fun. The best advertisement for BCH is the BTC experience. Fees, delays, LN... 
"Honestly your comments reek of the baseless propaganda that Core vomits up and non-technical noobs like you eat up like a hearty breakfast.

You're welcome to do whatever you want. Bitcoin Cash is a Bitcoin fork, it has every right to the name as Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Private, Bitcoin Silver, Bitcoin Platinum and every other Bitcoin fork has -- even Bitcoin Core.

And honestly, the BTC chain is no longer P2P digital cash which they openly admit, so I'm struggling to understand who is trying to deceive who at this point. I genuinely hope you truly are a new person trying to learn, but you're already regurgitating some of their bogus talking points as if they are facts so I'm leaning towards you being a concern troll and and this being an alt account."
Bitcoin cash is using the bitcoin name because it is bitcoin. It's an unbroken chain of blocks from the bitcoin genesis block with the workable scaling plan Satoshi devised. What's calling itself bitcoin right now isn't actually bitcoin. Segwit breaks the concept of coins being tracable back to their creation event in all nodes. RBF breaks fast transfers. The artificial block size limit forces fees to crazy highs.
Bitcoin cash is closer to what bitcoin was pre-2013. Since then, it’s bitcoin that has changed the most (for the worse). Bitcoin is bitcoin in name only. 
No big deal, read the whitepaper, look at the Core and Cash implementations. Most OG Bitcoiners are now in Bitcoin Cash.
"Fraud and deception is big among BCH and is how they manage to stay afloat.  Bitcoin Cash (BCH) takes over the BTC subreddit, sell Bitcoin Cash (BCH) under bitcoin dot com, they sell Bitcoin Cash (BCH) under the Bitcoin mobile wallet, they claim they are ""Bitcoin"" instead of ""Bitcoin Cash"" all after copying and replicating Bitcoin.  I don't know of a better example of a scam then BCH.  Just look at this /r/**btc** subreddit and judge for yourself if they are honest or being dishonest in their use of a subreddit labeled ""BTC"".  The real /r/bch subreddit is completely dead, just like BCH's credibility."
"> The threshold can easily be changed in the future. We can decide to increase it when the time comes.

And then there was Blockstream..."
Its not cool to pollute the public , I would be just as pissed with a Bitcoin sticker as a BCH one and remove both to clean up the city if I saw someones sticker graffiti 
I support bitcoin cash, but not vandals. Please find a new way to promote. Or at least don’t use cheap stickers, learn how to tag if you are going to vandalize.

It's a time to invest in - less than 11 bit-cents per BCH.
Now, I wonder who could be behind this?🤔🤔
You know I thought this sub was about bitcoin.  What is bitcoin cash and why does it exist? Seriously asking, I'm not being spiteful or confronting. 
One of core's best plays was convincing people to dump their BCH right after the fork happened. Now there are tons of people who hate BCH simply because they dumped all their BCH for BTC. 
the person who ripped it thought its a bitcoin not bitcoin cash.  whats bitcoin cash? right?
Below it.
"I've removed stickers in public places before (one example is an antifa stickers I've seen stuck on traffic lights). I'm astounded at the piss-poor job this individual has at removing that sticker. Like, seriously, all it usually takes is to take a pen and to use it to pick at the corners, the rest usually peels off. If someone's really triggered, and the sticker is really hard to remove, they could go as far as to get a razor blade and use that to scrape off the entire sticker. 

But the fact someone got so pissy, not at the fact the sticker is there, but at the fact the sticker is promotes Bitcoin Cash, they actually went through the effort of scratching out the what's on the sticker as opposed to making any effort to actually removing the sticker. 

That's just brilliant. 

Edit:
Upon second look, it's apparent that whoever scratched the sticker also scratched the surface below in their efforts. This image is the gift which keep on giving. "

Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin exclusively. The other coin that trades by the ticker BTC is not Bitcoin any more. A more appropriate term for it is Blockstream Token or SegWitCoin.

"This sub is about everything bitcoin, that includes both BTC and BCH.. It existed before BCH, so it's r/btc

Consensus took BTC in a new direction at the cost of a big part of what originally sold a big part of the community on it, so there was a fork from BTC before that happened in August 2017 and continued on with the original gameplan as BCH

Both are arguably different flavours of Bitcoin.. The majority went with Core's new direction so they got the original Bitcoin name, while BCH got the new name but doesn't compromise as much with the original plan"
Bitcoin cash is Bitcoin as per the Satoshi white paper. BTC is not Bitcoin. It's a weird science experiment

Bitcoin-Core has giant fees, while Bitcoin Cash has tiny fees and is meant for the whole world, while [BlockStream admits BitcoinLegacy is not for the whole world](https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/76372r/reminder_blockstream_chief_strategy_officer/)."
There is more than 1 kind of bitcoin now. You have come to the sub that doesn't censor posts and allows discussions of all types. Though generally we here prefer BCH over BTC because it is cheaper and faster and on the block chain.
You should replace it with 2

 Economists do not like Bitcoin. My favorite university professor is criticizing Bitcoin. Bitcoin is not money. Period. My favorite economist (who works for a commercial bank) is even more critical of Bitcoin. They miss the big picture. Bitcoin is a digital currency, but it is much more than that. It is a digital currency that works without the intervention of a central institution. Bitcoin is a payment system and money unit. The task is only to pass from one user to another. Slow blockchain. I choose faster coins like Stellar or Credits which has fast blockchain/ledger, the availability of smart contracts, orientation on the financial sector, supports different currencies 
It's like the anecdote of the university librarian who found a vandalized book about psychopathy...
