So /u/spez how much longer are you going to ignore the blatant censorship and manipulation r/bitcoin by its mods?
"Wow this is huge. I'm surprised /r/bitcoin mods were so sloppy that you were able to uncover that they were doing the vote botting, which means they were involved with the hacking (I wonder if they actually did the hacking too!). What's more crazy is the connection to /u/nullc which shows clearly that Blockstream and /r/bitcoin mods have been working together to manipulate the entire market! I'm dumbfounded. I would be really surprised if we don't see reddit admins take some action here against the mods and user accounts involved in this. 

Edit: I highly recommend you [message reddit admins directly](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Freddit.com&subject=Vote%20Manipulation) so they can look into this further. "

"/u/spez I once shied away from replying to you reddit admins when you asked me (u/PsyRev) what I meant by r/bitcoin being run badly by Theymos and doing bad things to ruin bitcoin. I didn't feel I had enough to give and I was leaving reddit (deleted my account as you see) at the time, so I figured you'd hear my plea and see for yourself in time.

Here we are now and I hope you're watching or that you'll be watching what's happening. This thread is a good indication of at least part of what's going on, so I'll leave it at that."

"Wow, epic, standing ovation! This confirms what we have suspected all along.  The criminal activity associated with Bitcoin Core / Blockstream goes all the way to the top.  If true this means that their CTO Greg Maxwell is at minimum complicit in criminal activity if not directly carrying it out or directing others to do so himself.

I've always been suspicious of the claim that the folks doing illegal things in the name of supporting Core are just some fanatics not directly associated with Core or Blockstream.  While people have been suspicious of Blockstream Core for a while this is the first time there is very direct and compelling evidence implicating Greg Maxwell.  Many of us assumed they were also behind the criminal attacks on XT, Classic, and Unlimited nodes but didn't have any proof.

"This comment from /u/4n4n4 got the double dash, no space too **and** talk about using the weight discount to favour CT transaction..

>Yup, you got it. Effectively CT would work like segwit is working now; if more people use it, blocks will be larger. Assuming a **lower weight is given to CT**, that **is--it's** still very early in the discussion :)
EDIT: Though as you can see in the code the 1MB limit was actually removed already, but due to how weighting works the data sent to legacy nodes will never exceed their 1MB limit.

"If I remember correctly Gregory Maxwell often refers to the ""Bitcoin Core project"" as ""the Bitcoin project"" which is quite unusual. Here's /u/4n4n4 also referring to the Bitcoin Core project as ""the Bitcoin project"" just as if there are no other (competing) node client projects such as Bitcoin Unlimited existing:

http://archive.is/2qfrJ#selection-2021.0-2021.55

It sure sounds like they're the same person. If it turns out that they are the same person then I feel a little embarrassed on Gregory's behalf because it's quite sad to invent a whole other person or (political) [wingman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wingman_\(social\)) like that."
Paging u/adam3us, what do you feel about a C-level executive in your company that might be involved in criminal activity that goes against the ethos of the community which you and all other companies within the Bitcoin sphere relies on? Personally, I find this kind of behavior disgraceful and completely unacceptable, and would take above accusation very seriously. If we as a community want to persevere and replace the legacy banking system, we cannot be seen as a bunch of authistic hackers. It is just bad branding.
Smoke everywhere.  /u/bashco clearly had knowledge of what was about to happen, BEFORE it happened. CU-2 is also damning.  That was not a hacked account and gave more fuel for the bot to upvote.  /u/spez /u/sodypop wtf is going on here?

The most telling aspect of this is the solid link of \/u\/nullc (Greg Maxwell of Blockstream) to the \/r\/bitcoin mods. It proves (again) they have been working together to manipulate both subs.

I feel like watching Spotlight right now. Real detective work has been done and things uncovered that many have suspected for a long time. Reddit admins better react to this. Will probably take some days/weeks for them to analyze the facts and do further investigation though."
"HOLY. FUCK.

If this doesn't get Reddit admin's attention I don't think anything will. But that doesn't matter as much. Why do people in Bitcoin allow this shit to carry on? This is BLACK AND WHITE PROOF of rBitcoin mods and Blockstream forming a cartel to take over Bitcoin. WTF!

Someone should let the reddit admins know about this. 
If r/bitcoin gets banned they will all come flooding to r/btc 
This is yet another example of why I moved some of my most valuable chips to the BCH side of the table. Here in r/btc we get intelligent conversation, sharp research and intellectual honesty while r/bitcoin censors anyone who doesn’t wave childish pro core meme-flags and give Thymos a Nazi kiss ass salute.

"This is merely scratching the surface. Any veteran programmer will tell you how easy it is to set up the code for bots. Just using a RNN, like say https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn can turn up enough semi-logical content to make some hard to automatically detect karma farming. And this isn’t even using anything remotely specialized. The fact is, if I could see myself be able to do this for fun (I am a veteran programmer), then for sure there’s team that are monetarily backed that have done the legwork already. Not that there’s that much to do. You can easily set up some pre-written conversation topics with some minor variations, code some fuzzy search and have bots automatically respond with your propaganda. You could even make the fuzzy search smarter than just regexes; plug in one of the many pre-existing libraries that do NLP. Again, very tough to detect an account that would do that, besides maybe using DNA sequencing algorithms to detect repeated patterns? Like there’s so many ways to do this that it’s not even funny. And soon enough we’ll have so much misinformation that we won’t be able to tell a real conversation from one that isn’t, kind of like r/politics. It’s the new spam of our age. It cost almost nothing to make, and the websites are wholly unequipped to filter it. And like spam, it isn’t that complicated to do. So yeah, expect this problem to become exponentially worse."

Wow, at this point rBitcoin should just be closed altogether
"Alright, I'll take a moment to look this over, if only to separate facts from speculation.

Here we go.

>When we first began looking at the massive downvoting attack as shown in BashCo's previously stickied thread last week, the first thing we noticed was that both of the bot-voted comments ( Image of #1, link to #2 ) would normally trigger our censorship notifier detection. Both ""censoring"" and ""censorship"" are trigger words we have found triggering automatic removal, something we later confirmed again. This would imply that either the comments were explicitly approved by the moderators at that time, or our understanding of the subreddit's policies needed updating. 

Actually, both /u/4n4n4 and /u/StopAndDecrypt have been approved submitters to /r/Bitcoin for 5 months or more. So no, neither comment needed to be manually approved by the moderators, and in fact, as a moderator of /r/Bitcoin, I can say for a fact that **neither comment was manually approved by a moderator of /r/Bitcoin**. This is a fact. 

So right there, your ""smoking gun"" (and your chief hypothesis) is out the window. Let's continue.

>The bots which were downvoting comments and posts on /r/Bitcoin and upvoting posts on /r/btc began their attack on 11/14/2017 at around 18:00 utc. A similar unusual pattern of voting appeared on /r/btc around the same time the day before, though less dramatically. The bots seemed to be pushing people to buy Bitcoin Cash in such a blatant way that it even left a bad taste in the mouths of Bitcoin Cash supporters. Both the attack the day before and the /r/Bitcoin bot voting attack on 11/14/2017 ended before or around 22:00 utc [REF-3]. The bots attacking /r/Bitcoin upvoted posts complaining about high fees and downvoted about 30 other /r/Bitcoin posts. At the same time they upvoted posts on /r/btc. We identified 65 comments downvoted by bots in /r/Bitcoin and 2 upvoted. The conclusions appeared to indicate that the bots were promoting Bitcoin Cash and /r/btc and harming /r/Bitcoin.

This is all true.

>We began investigating into the comments that caught our eye at first, referred to as [CU-1] and [CU-2] for short. [CU-1]'s content can be seen here as it originally looked. Immediately we noticed the next oddity - How were people able to see votes in /r/Bitcoin to discuss voting in the first place? /r/Bitcoin has blocked votes from being visible on comments during discussion for years. When did that change? We found that it changed right before [CU-1] was posted. BashCo stickied a comment stating they would ""pull back the curtains"" at 20:49, and archive.org confirmed that scores became visible between 20:32 utc and 20:50 utc. That, oddly enough, was just 13 minutes before [CU-1] was posted at 21:02:25.

So, to make sure the facts are straight here... the timeline here is that [this post](http://i.imgur.com/xrM39eb.png) was made, it was upvoted massively by a malicious bot army, [BashCo started a thread about it](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7cyj7o/i_just_got_257_downvotes_in_8_minutes_for_calling/) to call attention to it (and as you noted, [he temporarily enabled transparent vote-scores to highlight the attack](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7cyj7o/i_just_got_257_downvotes_in_8_minutes_for_calling/dptn609/)), and the attack continued from there. Then darwin2500 chimed in *to make fun of BashCo for pointing out the attack*, and was immediately upvoted massively (by the same malicious bot army, it would seem). It was approved by StopAndDecrypt a couple of minutes later (almost certainly because he was replying to the comment, and it was *yet another example of vote manipulation* that served to highlight what was being done and reinforce BashCo's valid points), and later deleted by darwin2500, the original submitter of the comment.

I don't see what you mean by ""oddly enough"", considering the entire episode was about *an ongoing vote manipulation campaign* that BashCo and StopAndDecrypt were calling attention to. In other words, none of the above seems to indicate *any* sort of foul play from *any* moderators of /r/Bitcoin *whatsoever*, but it seems like you are trying to imply that it does.

>We have determined that [CU-1] was indeed blocked by /r/Bitcoin's automoderator rules as we expected. The screenshot taken by /r/Bitcoin moderator StopAndDecrypt clearly shows this, as the ""moderator approved"" checkmark is present. We also tested automoderator rules with an aged account with karma and confirmed that ""censors"" and ""censoring"" were both blocked [REF-1]. Note that the poster, darwin2500 (under control of hacker, please don't ping them; they aren't a Bitcoiner) could not have been an ""approved submitter"" - they seem to have only had one comment in /r/Bitcoin before the hacking.

So you are aware of the ""approved submitter"" possibilities, and failed to even *mention* the possibility that either StopAndDecrypt or 4n4n4 were approved submitters in your very first paragraph when you said: ""Both ""censoring"" and ""censorship"" are trigger words we have found triggering automatic removal, something we later confirmed again. This would imply that either the comments were explicitly approved by the moderators at that time, or our understanding of the subreddit's policies needed updating.""? That in itself is rather telling.

Readers, I urge you to re-read my previous paragraph until you understand the point I am making very clearly. OP is *very* deliberately trying to ""spin a narrative"" here, not mentioning the possibility of certain comments being visible because they were made by approved submitters (which I can tell you for a fact is the truth) and instead pretending like the **only** possible explanation for the comment(s) being visible was that they were manually approved by /r/Bitcoin moderators (they were not), *even though they obviously know about approved submitters on reddit and discuss this later on in their post*.

>So why was the comment manually approved? 

As I said above, /u/StopAndDecrypt *was replying to the comment in question*, and was obviously *trying to highlight the vote manipulation that was going on*. You can't very well reply to a comment that isn't visible, and it is completely obvious why this comment was approved, when you look at the context it was made in and what was going on.

>We are not aware of any other approved or allowed comments that blatantly reference censorship like that in the last several months. 

There are **many**, but admitting this doesn't help the narrative that you are trying to spin. I remembered (off the top of my head) an instance from just a few days ago, and [dug it up for you as an example](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7dks5y/cut_the_bullshit/dpyif6k/).

So once again, this is more evidence that you're presenting information *incredibly* disingenuously. Comments that reference the alleged ""censorship"" of /r/Bitcoin are allowed all the time, even on a daily basis, despite the fact that they are off-topic and usually made by troll-armies just to stir up drama and mislead newcomers.

>Except this idea did not hold up. We found 10 similar comments from the same time period which were not approved or were explicitly removed unlike [CU-1]. Some of these were uncannily similar to the original comment. For example this one was submitted 8 minutes after [CU-1] and never approved. Another here supported neither subreddit and was blocked at 21:48 and never approved. This one accused /r/Bitcoin mods of being paid by Blockstream and was manually removed at ~22:35. A fourth was identical to [CU-2] and blocked at 00:12 and never approved. The same account of [CU-1] submitted a second comment 5 minutes after [CU-1] and was blocked and not approved. The other 5 things blocked or removed around the same time were: [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]. The existence or absence of most of these comments around the claimed time can be verified independently of the censorship_notifier, see [REF-2]

What on earth? How does this paragraph *in any way* indicate that ""this idea does not hold up""? 

Your argument in this paragraph seems to be: ""If you allow/approve *one comment* that is discussing 'censorship' in the subreddit (to highlight the vote brigading going on, then *you must also allow every single malicious comment made by every troll in the same thread!*"" 

How does that make any sense? The point of the thread was to point out how obviously vote-brigaded things were being, and how the discussion was being manipulated. Letting one or two example comments demonstrate the point is sane. **Letting the entire thread be overrun by trolls would not be!** 

The argument in this paragraph makes no sense! You say ""this idea did not hold up"" but it holds up perfectly. "

"Regardless of whether you support Bitcoin (legacy/core) or Bitcoin Cash, if you engage in hacking, bot voting/posting, opportunistic propaganda, you are harming your project. Just don't do it. 

One of the hallmarks of the bitcoin debate on twitter has been fake accounts liking posts (30-50 likes really suddenly by people with accounts that only have 50 or so followers, and just look a bit too obviously trying to be 'normal'), trolling people, and amplifying messages (propaganda). My suspicion is that the same people who engage in this crow about having 'the community' on their side - in other words they have no ethics or credibility and are just toxic people incapable of self reflection.

The reasoning behind removing the votes displayed limit by the r/Bitcoin moderator make sense. They don't prove anything.

It is possible that is was all a r/bitcoin conspiracy but it is equally possible that it was someone from r/btc who did that. There is nothing in this posts that provides much evidence for either things.

The upvotes and the number of times this post has been gilded makes me suspicious that most people here are merely wishing for it to be a r/bitcoin conspiracy, whether there be any evidence for it or not.

If anyone can dig deeper and prove anything about what happened with the account hacks, that would be welcome but I am afraid this post does not provide enough evidence for anything.

This thread is almost as unproductive as the several vote brigading threads yesterday on r/Bitcoin front page. Let's not get distracted over petty squabbles and focus on more productive conversation. :)"
How anyone can back BTC that does stuff like this is beyond me.  It goes against the entire spirit of cryptocurrency and what we hope to achieve with it.  This is why we support BCH.

There's only one thread to read through.  Before compiling your evidence, just read the one thread all the way through to make sure you didn't miss anything.

My guess on the whole ""attack"" was that it was a poorly programmed bot going wild.  Likely the bot was programmed to downvote comments 20 times an hour and the programmer missed a decimal place on a timer and it went wild with 200 votes a second.

"So the argument is that moderators approved a comment and then it started being attacked by downvotes, and therefore the mods must be behind those downvotes?

Could it be that the mods knew the pattern of the bot from experience, so picking the correct comment was trivial?

For example if your subreddit gets vote manupilated every day you start to understand what type of comments it happens to. Then you configure auto moderator to remove these comments and require manual approval. But then to show the manipulation you can just approve one, and voila the bots get to work.

So its sort of like having a lake full of piranhas, you know they are there but dont see them until you throw some meat into and it becomes a huge frenzy. "
