So, did anything ever come of this?

There's a difference between evidence and proof. Evidence is useful even if it can't definitively prove something on its own. However, if he had responded with the evidence shortly after my request, I certainly would have been convinced it wasn't Greg, even if I couldn't definitively prove it. (Because it would have been relatively difficult for Greg to find someone else to pose for it in such a short period of time, and relatively easy for Greg to just ignore my request.)
Here’s a site I just found that agrees. It’s still not proof, though. https://83m6a1f16h.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/redditsockdetector/dectect/qubeqube/nullc
"I don't get how you get from 4n4n4n is cnull, to core modes hacked their own users to perform a false flag. ....

all we have evidence of is of a voting manipulation attack, and mods lifting the curtain and selectively banning certain comments. why? not clear.

But to go from there to they did it? 

Well, it concerns me that ppl here would take such a leap, sure doesn't make rbtc mods look good and this side of the community anyways
