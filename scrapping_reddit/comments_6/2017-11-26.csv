I messaged him negatively and he showed me a picture where he wrote his Reddit user name and my user name and showed that he actually is a graduate from a university in Canada. Proving to me that he's not Greg.
Oh you have evidence? I'll just ignore it
I see you don't really understand thr situation

> but I fail to see it applicable in the case of low inflation.

That's the real travesty! You know when they say a frog will jump out of a pot with boiling water, but if you put it in cold water and heat up very slowly, it'll eventually get cooked? That's exactly it!! It's because the effect is not immediate that people don't see it, but it's there. We didn't go from $1 to 5$ for a Big Mac in one day, or even a year. It took us ~30yrs! But now it seems like 5$ is just normal, and no one complains. 


>Inflation is driven by, and encourages, inherent greed.

I'm very anal when it comes to words... don't agree with this. Inflation ""allows"" greed to disguise and manifest itself, but is not driven by it. Not sure it even encourages it.

>Social and academic improvement vs production as our collective raison d'etre.

and Buddha's quote

>""Desire and ignorance are the origins of suffering.""


Will not disagree with this a bit!! The elephant in the room, however, is... 2500 years. The Buddha said that 2500 years ago, and since then, we're arguably back just where we were then! Possibly even worse, consumerism, desire for material wealth and personality cult are at ATH, never mind Bitcoin ATH! So in 2500 years we did not make very much progress on this. Feel free to disagree, but as far as I'm concerned, to believe that Bitcoin will solve this is just not realistic. Bitcoin, or cryptos in general, will just encourage saving rather than spending, so we'll need to find something else to do. Maybe this will lead to an era where we compete in physical and mental challenges instead of in hoarding wealth, but I don't believe so.

Finally, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/78gtdu/i_am_more_of_an_eth_guy_so_correct_me_if_i_am/dp0jk0i/) is a reply I wrote a while ago on the small vs big blocks issue. It touches on various topics, including Blockstream's role and more. Maybe you truly believe that we can scale on-chain, but the large expert opinion is that we cannot. A bit like global warming - You have scientists who don't believe humans are causing it, even independent scientists. My main argument for off-chain scaling is that no complex system that has successfully achieved scale has ever scaled on the base layer. And I provide examples.

Wow, very insightful and interesting comment. Thank you. I'm guessing that you would recommend that book? I could use a good nonfiction read right now.
Uh what?
"> Alberto Brandolini was right

Hmm, I've read arguments for the opposite, to the effect of ""it takes more energy to conceive and maintain lies, than it does to reveal the truth"". Julian Assange talked about this in his *'When Google met Wikileaks'* book, but I can't find my copy right now to dig up an exact quote. 

I think this holds true though, even in cases like this where you have gone to great lengths to refute the bullshit. By spreading truth, liars must invest even more resources in order to perpetuate their shit. 

I think that Brandolini's law contains some truth though. In situations where understanding the truth is complex, falsehood can be more easily spread, and takes a lot of energy to clean up. "
"Thanks! Honestly, your reference to Brandolini sent me down a bit of a rabbit hole of reading, as it seemed to be at odd's with 'Assange's law' (to be fair I don't think it is originally Assange's idea, but I'm calling it that because I don't know a better name/reference). 

But I think the two are reconcilable: 'Assange's Law' works in an ideal situation, where participants are informed, behave logically, and are willing to learn and admit mistakes. 'Brandolini's Law' mocks this ideal, and highlights the issues that arise dealing with actual people. In reality, people [are pre-programmed to have cognitive biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases), so it can take a lot of effort to *""correct their bullshit""*, so to speak.

Anyways, I do recommend the book, its a short but interesting read. The majority of the book is just an annotated conversation, but it touches on a lot of great stuff pertaining to philosophy of journalism, digital sovereignty, they even talk about bitcoin a little! Its available for purchase online using bitcoin too :)

As an aside, serious thanks for your work refuting bullshit in here. I'm sure you now have a staunch appreciation of Brandolini's law :P"
But that's clearly not what happened

"What about paper fiat as a store of value? It’s just paper so not useful for much else. What about the numbers in your bank account? Same thing. Trust is what defines a store of value. That’s why people invest in stocks, bitcoin, etc. Gold is so antiquated I don’t know why people still compare it as if we would ever use gold as a realistic future store of value, unless there is a MAJOR world economic collapse. Humans are constantly innovating new ways of storing value. 

Who caress whether you can make shit with it??? I can make tin foil hats out of my Reynolds Wrap, and one side of the aluminum is prettier than the other side, but it obv will never be worth anything. 

TL/DR
Crypto absolutely is a store of value as long as people continue to believe it is one."
