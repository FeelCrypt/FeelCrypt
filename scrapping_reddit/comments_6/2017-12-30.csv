It’s also worth remembering that Bitcoin Cash already has the block size increase and the lower transaction fees, so it’s entirely possible that it will render BTC useless.
"Oh no, it's always been in development. The creator and lead developer is a great technical lead and focused on making the software. Marketing was never a priority. There aren't many places for crypto discussion. The only ones that I know of are 4chan, Reddit and Twitter. I don't use the latter.
Lately Raiblocks got popular in all of them (check solume.io).

My point about Bitcoin was that it's now too big to double in a week (I'm referring to 20k-40k, 10k-20k does not count because it already happened). In my opinion the upside of Bitcoin is low compared to the risks. Mainly because I don't believe in it anymore. Core did a horrible job with it, and now it's an old piece of tech that isn't even usable... Now its future is completely dependent on the LN, which I don't think will work as promised. Hence during this year I sold all my Bitcoins. I buy Bitcoin only if there are pairs I'm interested in that only have BTC as numeraire.

It could go to 50-100k or 0 and I wouldn't care. I want to focus on solid projects like XMR and XRB. And in the periods of bull markets I'm flipping shitcoins, which is fun and delivers very high returns."
"Alright admittedly didn’t know that.  But why I has no one mentioned it until this most recent wave of noobs?  I don’t spend much time on Reddt, which is the only semi-public place I’ve seen where XRB discussion is prevalent.  Seems as if there has been 0 development for quite some time.

As far as talking about BTC - it literally doubled in a week, and will be $50,000+ next year.  So I wouldn’t count on the notion that it can’t happen again."
Segwit = segregated witness, LN = lightning network 
"> Anyone saying otherwise is lying.

I assume you know all possible arguments against your statement and have an answer to all of them, because there is nobody in the world that could possibly know something about bitcoin you don't."
"That's just tweaking the constant, not improving the tech. Neither 8mb nor 32mb nor any reasonable block size will be able to handle 10K to 100K transaction per second.

You are right to say that bitcoin cash would be able to handle the current bitcoin volume of transaction just fine. But if BCH were to become the new bitcoin, it would hit another capacity limit just a few orders or magnitude about the current bitcoin capacity. Since adoption is increasing exponentially, we're taking a time line of a few months or years in the best estimate, BCH really isn't much more scalable that bitcoin. **It is, and remain, the same core technology**.

It was fun visiting other subreddits and tipping out of nowhere, and very well received.

No one cares about moral value when we’re making money. 
Komodo will ensure banks die. The second we are free of exchanges we're 100% unregulated and they can't prove anything we do to tax it.
Divide and conquer right? Dont be immature. The success of any and all bitcoin chains is a success for all of crypto. If BtH or btc or a future fork takes dominance, we are ALL better off.
Normal people don't care about these things at all.

Wikipedia: The predecessor to the Ripple payment protocol, Ripplepay, was first developed in 2004 by Ryan Fugger,[14][15] a web developer in Vancouver, British Columbia.[16] Fugger conceived of the idea after working on a local exchange trading system in Vancouver, and his intent was to create a monetary system that was decentralized and could effectively allow individuals and communities to create their own money. Fugger's first iteration of this system, RipplePay.com,[17] debuted in 2005 as a financial service to provide secure payment options to members of an online community via a global network.[16][18]
Of course they don't care, they just need the rumor to spread to get their pump in. Banks wont use XRP.
"There's probably a ton of videos on that. I think Tone Vays did a whole hour long video with peter todd about the ""ripple scam."" Noobs will get suckered into ripple's marketing and pump tactics no matter what."
GDAX put out a token asset framework that lists many of the qualities they require in coins they will consider listing. Ripple fails in several aspects. Examples include ripple being centralized and the supply of xrp not being distributed.
"Well for one thing, Coinbase's listed criteria (https://www.gdax.com/static/digital-asset-framework-2017-11.pdf) for listing a token mentions things like: it should be ""An open financial system is defined as being available to everyone and not controlled by a single entity"" .....""The network is public, decentralized, and enables trustless consensus"" and ""The project leadership is not highly centralized or dependant on a small number of key persons"". With such a massive amount of coins being held by Ripple Labs, and the control that they have over the network in general, with no miners to provide any kind of counterbalance/competition for distribution or power over the network...I doubt Coinbase feels Ripple meets those guidelines."
Only if they cash out.
They will not even consider it. Ripple whales spread that rumor solely for the pump. It simply doesn't meet coinbase requirements.
"I agree and actually I agreed with everything you wrote in OP, basically. But don't be silly, you got my point. Core is a pool hate, we should focus on education as you said, but the means to this end matter a lot, let's not be like them. 

There are dozens of threads about how ripple is a bankster shitcoin, but no one was educating about ripple before it was pumping."
"its mostly that ripple has no place amongst cryptocurrency

i took interest in crypto because i saw that it was a way to beat the banks"
"Central banks also ""solve a problem"", do you love them too?"
They feel threatened because it's now clear that the price of BTC didn't increase because people care about the issue, but just because they saw it as a way to make money. Such people will go straight to Ripple or whatever else they think will make them money next.
"Just educate people, if someone asks you about Ripple or Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash, you tell them the basic. In the end if they are greedy and just want more money and do not give a shit about decentralisation, which lot of people are, its still their choice. Eventually they will not be happy with banks and will want to change to Bitcoin Cash... information is the key.

PS: I have one guy at work who bought Ripple, I tried to explain to him that its centralised and fully digital for of Fiat, but he doesn't care, he said he wants to side with banks as he thinks they will win. So, he's one of those assholes and ignorant greedy fools, but what can you do?"
"It is bitcoin, a bitcoin fork. I am happy and its great it exists, wether side by side, as the triumphant coin in the long stretch or another alt coin in history.. what is really really dumb, and hurtful to both chains is 3rd grade bickering and infighting over naming conventions and turf wars.. do we want Ripple dominating the narrative? Stop arguing over bulshit.. bitcoin existed, it forked, we have the original chain and forked chains, all bitcoin.. stop crying foul over mainingless ""status"" ego shit and focus on making all crypto succeed. United the whole economy is stronger. Focus on the tech."

Who do banks pay fees to when moving money? Isn't it just other banks? I would imagine that they won't be too interested in cutting into their own income to much...
">banks can use to lower fees in their business model

As if that would happen. "
"Exactly. It's not a cryptocurrency. It's simply a way for banks to move money around between themselves inexpensively. Whether the banks end up using or not is another question. I'm not even sure why it's being listed on exchanges as it has nothing to do with crypto.
"
"Big business are centralized, the market is centralized. This is what most people know and are comfortable with. Most still don't get what ""cybermoney"" can do other than appreciate like a tulip bubble (see, for example, that incredibly ignorant article today by a veteran financial advisor in a veteran financial publication - Forbes). Ripple's business plan is different but smart; they appeal to the quasi-informed masses and can masquerade as a traditional third party processor or a disruptive cryptocurrency as needed depending on their client. They offer a comfortable solution and entry point for traditional businesses. Ripple isn't a cryptocurrency, it's more like a stock share, but it provides a service and has a centralized epicenter that won't dicker for 3 years over whether or not to have 1mb or 2. Big businesses like having someone to call when their transaction fees increase 1000%. I suspect there's room for Ripple in our new world economy that coexists with cryptocurrencies, doesn't exclude them, and may even *help* them by bridging the banking - crypto chasm. That, and BTC is a dead man walking. A broken toy whose market share is getting radically redistributed. Further, if Bitcoin BCH burns out like a tulip pyramid, which it's hell-bent on doing, other brands will appear more attractive, and Bitcoin Cash may, in fact, **not** want to associate itself so closely with the tainted bitcoin brand, and may actually *benefit* by branding itself as something like... Bcash. I know, but if people think of the DMV when they hear the word ""Bitcoin""... Lastly, other cryptos benefit from the ugly BTC - BCH battle. Ether, Ripple, Dash... They don't have this stink and can slip into this void. Divide and conquer."
I understand perfectly. I have spent my whole life working for big business. There is more at play here then simply corporate money going into a solution that will work for them. I don’t have a btc bth dispute. I am investing to make money but I also invest in coins that are as far away from corporate interests as possible. 
"Meh it doesn't even work. My crypo subs are filled with desperate newbs crying about missing transactions and zero balances. That's the thing, bch just works, just like ether when you don't run into weird gas problems.

BCH doesn't have these problems because it has 8+ years of development in it. Nothing, I repeat, nothing will replace BTC based chains for actual usage in atleast a couple of years.

Not that it matters when markets sees 80%+ gains in a day. In the end though, actual ussge will be what crowns the king. Not gains, not speculation, not market cap."
Exactly. Ripple isn't for the people, it's for the banks. I'm just here to ride the wave.

Xrp can do a lot of good...! Fiat is debt based... mainly issued to governments and we all pay the interest. We are paying bong debt via put taxes for $27 trillion which is locked up... without getting benefit... xrp can release some of that... and that's a good thing... surely"
">This mass crypto adopting bank free utopia you speak of sounds nice, and if we make it there i'll buy you a fucking cappucino or whatever with some doge... but again with that point you answered your own point perfectly: Doge is not going to get integrated into core banking software platforms. In the mean time we live in the real world, with banks, and they will perform insane magnitudes larger amounts of transactions than this whole little crypto world will. Maybe in a few years things will be different, but there will probably still be banks, and I bet they will be using Ripple or something like it.

Not really, bank settle transfer with very few transactions.

That’s why you have to wait few days for a bank transfer to settle because bank settle their debt to each other on a daily basis not on a transfer per transfer basis.

Banks will still exist in some form in the future of course, but we won't be bound to them either if we don't need them to privately transact with each other. Banking doesn't need to die so much as *privatized state fiat* does. "
Yes and the little guy didnt have the internet in 'history'. The banks will be putting up a massive fight in the future and putting pressure on governments to do the same. But the seed has been planted with cryptos and the ones that will survive will be the ones that comply with the banks standards and the anonymous cryptos that act on there own accord. 
Statements on potential scaling are being thrown around here and there for all major cryptocurrencies. I only care about what it can do right now, which is 1.5M tx/day at best.

You can't set up your own node.  You can setup something they call a validator but you can't mine and it's not a full node.  Ripple will collapse when people realize it's a scam.
It's not a shitcoin.  It's literally a banker coin.  Also, who cares what you like.  Sounds to me more like you're a ripple investor that doesn't want people to speak the truth.  Ripple is a banker coin that is in no way decentralized.  People are paying for entries in a companies database that is supported by banks.  Every person in this community should know that.  If that's what they want, so be it.  Still, they need to know.   If you don't believe me, go try to set up a ripple node and be a part of the network.
Umm wasn’t referring to you specifically. Shouldn’t of used word post I guess was referring more to comments and the seems like everyday argumentative shit show 
Ripple used to advertise on CMC, so I'm sure that had something to do with it.
Yes, it is based on trust...at some point every decision you make revolving cryptocurrencies requires a degree of trust. No reason to be upset about me stating what Ripple labs has said and showing a degree of trust for the statement.
"> If Ripple lacks this consensus mechanism, then what prevents Ripple labs from introducing a software change that permits more coins to be issued?

Im sorry but what are you talking about? https://ripple.com/build/xrp-ledger-consensus-process/

Ripple definitely has a consensus mechanism. I hold both XRP and BCC along with a lot of other stuff that isnt BTC - and I'm confused why the fuck this forum is so goddamn upset at others' success. BCH is still doing AMAZING. Jesus fucking christ calm down and stop hating on everything that isnt bitcoin cash. Even if they dont end up having consensus, just stay away from XRP and move on. I'm tired of the negativity running through this damn community."
Man maybe 1% of the population cares about decentralization, sound money, web3 architecture, self sovereign identity, the benefits this revolutionary technology holds for society in its scaled form. Everyone in it now is just chasing dollar signs like locusts. Pumping the latest shit coin. Nobody gives a fuck to be bothered to even remotely understand what they're investing in. I'm afraid you're pushing water up hill. 
"If only there were some device that would enable one to research questions like this ....;-)

"Who says that 1mil XRP is worth 2mil USD... <- the market, the exchanges. 

Does that mean if I had 1 million USD of XRP and the current price on Coinbase was $2 and I wanted to sell .. would I get $2million USD -- possibly.. 

It depends on **liquidity**... or how many waiting **buy orders** there are at $2 price. 

If there are > $2 worth of banks/people wanting to but at $2 then .. yes I'd get $2 .. 
but if only $1million buy orders at $2 then $1million at $1.90 then I'd end up with an avg sell price of $1.95.. so my $2million of XRP is actually worth $1.95.

**Don't be confused with the mkt cap of crypto ccy...** 

**Removing $200BN Mkt Cap from Bitcoin only takes 3 things**

As an **extreme**.. if Bitcoin were to have a mass -ve troll campaign that spread FUD .. and no-one wanted to buy... or say the crypto algorithm got cracked.. 

Then the price could go from **$15000 to $1 with a single sell order** (if all persons with buy orders cancelled them) and my $1 buy orders are there...
So you could wipe off $200 BN of Mkt cap with:

a) A single $1 buy order

b) A mkt sell order for 1 bitcoin 

c) News of a reproducable crypto hack.... 

where did the money go???
Well that's another post :-) 

You are correct that during the 6 seconds of transmission of XRP, that the price could fluctuate.
However this is not very different from the current FX Spot market, which also can fluctuate in 6 seconds. (at least in time as adoption/liquidity increases)

The International Settlements scenario is somewhat dependent upon there being sufficient liquidity to keep the price of XRP near constant ... at some point in the future (or at least stable over 6 seconds time periods) -- with the fluctuations, being more FIAT ccy fluctuations than fluctuations due to the fundamentals of XRP. i.e. say the Fed Reserve interest rates move... this will cause a change in the exchange rate of the USD.. so the price of XRP will change.. 

Many advantages -- 

i) cheaper than the swift network. 

ii) faster the the swift network

iii) Less support intensive than the swift network

iv) Less counterparty risk of default whilst Bank As fiat CCY is in Bank Bs Nostro account. 

v) Frees up a mass of fiat ccy"
I could see how this would be done but it could be done with any cryptocurrency, not just ripple. The value changing during the transaction would cause issues. I guess it would be less of a counterparty risk than normal though. But for those amounts, you would need the value to be extremely high to not fluctuate a ton when the bank sold 2 million at a time.

Ripple is not trying to compete with BTC. They are trying to solve a problem for the banks.
No it doesn't.  Ripple is a centralized, trusted system of men in power.
"Validator nodes provide a concusses on most matters...including modifying the reserve and transaction ""fee"" that gets destroyed. As to whether this consensus method can block Ripple Labs from releasing more XRP or not I can't say...but it appears that the ledger itself has the maximum 100 billion XRP amount baked into it disallowing an amount greater than that...so unless I missed something in my research adding more XRP would probably be akin to creating a hard fork since it would invalidate the ledger...but it could be akin to a softfork though too, not gonna pretend to know for sure but that is a completely valid concern."
corrected to 2013
Ripple and Tether serve totally different goals. Neither is an open blockchain
You are mistaken here, because the 1 billion isn't being created but rather pulled from an escrow contract...that becomes available to sell to financial institutions or the exchanges...anything that isn't bought at the end of the month goes back into another 54 month escrow FYI. So the billion coins don't go into their pockets, but they can profit off of selling it for fiat and releasing it out into the wild.
[deleted]
Maybe it is bank/fed money and not peoples money, which set the new ripple ATH ...
Yeahhh, I kinda was thinking about this earlier today. I decided that I got into crypto (despite it was only a month ago) for its innovation and the decentralization. XRP is not that and with that said, I sold as much as I had and put it elsewhere into something I actually believe in.
I see dotcom bubble written all over this. New tech, super cool and promising, not much to show for itself other than potential and solid foundations with massive amounts of money flowing into it. The public’s in on it now and the sharks are circling...
The pump coins create wealth to dump into the better coins though. Even the well educated investors pick up some here and there.
The whole market is at a peak, so it might very well be, but a influx of assets are incoming over the months, I hear... I'm betting on people will learn quickly - when missing profits vs gaining them. 
"> It's a shame too, because really good tech is getting ignored for pump and dump coins that don't do anything at all;

Same happened when the internet was born. Linux and their derivatives were bashed for years before they were finally the industry standard. My first IT job outside of helpdesk I vividly remember being berated by the ""big corporate solaris guys"" because of my preference for linux over open solaris or the bsds. Looking back it makes me wonder who will buy XRP to destroy it once it's purpose has been outlived."
This is the answer. Ripple is inflated due to pure speculation. I made a shitload of money shorting Ripple during the last XRP crash, and I intend to make even more this time.

"Ok err few things... 

>What real world use? A few hundred bank branches in Japan?

Yeah, for a start. Those few hundred bank branches in Japan will handle transactions for a large part of Japan's 120 million + people.

This mass crypto adopting bank free utopia you speak of sounds nice, and if we make it there i'll buy you a fucking cappucino or whatever with some doge... but again with that point you answered your own point perfectly: Doge is not going to get integrated into core banking software platforms. In the mean time we live in the real world, with banks, and they will perform insane magnitudes larger amounts of transactions than this whole little crypto world will. Maybe in a few years things will be different, but there will probably still be banks, and I bet they will be using Ripple or something like it.

>Ripple is going to accomplish what exactly? 30-60% cost savings for banks vs using SWIFT and save banking customers days in international wires? Woopee

Yeah dude. That's a fucking trillion dollar a year business. Hence, my entire point... and 30-60% is kinda a big deal to these banks.

>Oh and did I mention that all the margin profits that Ripple Labs will get from banks for implementing their product goes 100% to Ripple Labs and company and exactly 0% to XRP hodlers? Yep.

Yeah, I know dude, it's a token, not a dividend bearing share in a company. But it is, and will be, used on the Ripple network. Hence it's value.

No, the banks can utilize the liquidity added by the markets though. But if the banks only intend to use it for submitting IOUs then the amount of ripple required is minimal. Basically it is just as speculative as any other cryptocurrency, with the knowledge that banks using XRP makes it cheaper for them to perform transactions. So the more normal people that own XRP the more incentive banks have to purchase it from exchanges if either A) all the 1 billion released for the month was already purchased or B) The entire pool of coins is accounted for and release to the wild, so the only option is to purchase more from exchanges. Put pinning an accurate value on the worth of an XRP isn't any easier than calculating the true value of any crypto.
"Truth is, they don't need to. If they wanted to use the XRP ledger and network for transferring only IOUs they could...but it requires more work to do so than using XRP as the intermediary...plus doing so is even cheaper than not doing it...so you have profit motive to use XRP.

The main thing that adds liquidity is the Rippled flag you can set on an account...the tech behind it is interesting and worth a read since I can't do it justice here. The other component is market makers trading it on an exchange and having others buy it in secondary markets and continue to trade it or find places where it can be used as a currency as more adopt its use.

As to the fundamental economics of it all...well that is hard to pin down...currently fiat transfers use nostro and vostro accounts which are literally money just sitting there for the purpose of settling fiat conversions. The intent is to allow that money, estimated to be around 27 trillion dollars worth globally, to enter back into the narrow money band along with ensuring that XRP transactions are able to settle quicker than the current method....and the fact that transactions settle quicker via the Ripple network makes it more liquid than those accounts and SWIFT transfers...hence why SWIFT is looking into blockchains for the purpose of liquidity making them a possible competitor with Ripple Labs if they don't simple adopt the use of the Rippled network. So placing a value on that is difficult imo, but I would say using market cap to determine any currencies worth as seems to be the norm right now is a piss poor method and ignores the fact that the intent of cryptos is to replace fiat currency...which cryptos only make up a very small percentage of currently meaning they all have a lot of room to grow if used as intended."

"You can't really educate people to not follow a pump. You have to get rekt by yourself, maybe a few times, to see the underlying risk.

Yeah, the current Ripple pump is an amazing natural spectacle, but nothing to be worried of."
"Exactly. But most on messages boards apply TL;DR so they miss this type stuff!"
It honestly is f**king genius. If you are a new startup today, instead of IPO'ing on the stock market, ICO really is the way to go to access some fast funds.
"Like really. They made more than 100b today, that is more than Apple earns in a year. Can you imagine out-earning apple's yearly profit in a fucking day?

(That is if this price above 2 is sustainable, which it obviously isnt)"
XRP still has value as a fast and nearly free transfer of value from person A to person B. And it can scale to the level of VISA (50k transactions per second) most other cryptocurrencies cannot get anywhere close to that.
So basically they should have IPO'ed. What are they doing here pretending to be a crypto currency? You don't see any of their head honcho guys spelling out the facts for people.
"> The fact that all the consensus nodes are controlled by one entity and that nobody else can join in the fun is also a strong hint.

"Well XRP mainly is designed to not be held but to be used as an intermediary for fiat pair conversions freeing up nostro accounts.

That said it fits well into the whole discussion on the fictional token they discuss, in that I doubt that the XRP will ever be valued at its real worth IMO. I just don't see it being valued linearly to the value added by freeing up the 27 trillion locked in nostro accounts...maybe a few trillion if no one jumps in to compete with what Ripple labs is doing since XRP transactions are cheaper than using the ledger to send a different currency IOU via trust lines. But that is still speculation."
Right, they ALL store cash under the bed. What a ridiculous thing to say. It's under the futon.
Don’t be so infantile. Banking does more than just cause mortgage crises. Companies can’t exist without them, you can’t own property without them, you can’t buy 99.99% of all goods without them.
Trust me, I have been following the crypto scene since around 2010 at the latest...I understand the end goal. The thing is that the biggest issue with the old banking structure is mistrust. Making money transparent will get rid of a lot of that mistrust. Making the currency not controlled by any government will remove mistrust. That said, XRP isn't even close to banker controlled...and it is no more centralized than any other crypto where a few mining pools can completely take control of the blockchain if desired. So if you dislike XRP that is your choice...but cryptos aren't overthrowing banks anytime soon as evidenced by the fact everyone is using cryptocurrencies as a security rather than as currency...gonna take a few years minimum before that starts to really happen, and at that point what do you use to derive the value of the coin from? If fiat becomes worthless, who actually dictates what the worth is? Good luck getting a consensus among the masses as to its worth any time close to when that event actually occurs.
Why do they even have a public token? What is the point when the public can't use the network?

Hey, that is fine. Everyone is allowed to make their own decisions and I am not going to berate you for wanting to hold onto the more purist reasons for backing cryptocurrencies. I just see XRP as being the first step towards achieving true decentralization, that can eventually be replaced by a more decentralized coin once all (or a majority of) broad money becomes liquid...but XRP I believe is going to have a head start if they are the only coin working with the financial institutions to solve the problem of illiquidity that exists in certain transaction types.

"The only thing not adding up is your logic.

The fees aren't charged per se, but are values removed entirely from the XRP ledger entirely. Those fees also are less than a few hundred thousandths of one XRP btw.

That said, if you really want to trace back who gets the money for the fees...that would be Ripple Labs since they are the origin of all XRP. So they got paid for the XRP that is getting removed.

Also, account freezes aren't nearly as big of a deal as some people are making them to be...but knowing that might require you to actually read how the freeze function works for XRP ledger accounts rather than spread fear and disinformation."
"I thought they don't have to burn XRP, but an other token on a non-public blockchain. Can't find an original source, though, so you might have a point here.

Exactly...the only real thing is who comes out on top when it comes to freeing up those nostro accounts and allowing those funds to be re-purposed...if it isn't XRP though it will be some other crypto that is willing to work with the financial industry.
No, I am saying that what makes something centralized is when a majority has control over the network...very easy even with bitcoin if 5 mining pools collude to work together...and shit like reversing transactions can happen in bitcoin...basically no system is perfect, but I meant what I said, no confusion involved.

[The person you replied to is a class-A astroturfer](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7n1idg/ripple_user_comes_to_defend_ripple_gets_hundreds/)
"To your first point: Ripple isn't the one that can freeze funds unless it was from a direct connection between them and an account. I know there is a lot of fear after hearing about the amount frozen due to a holder trying to liquidate the majority of their funds, but it was done to protect the holders from a massive price swing hence why the initial contract stated that the holder could only sell a certain amount every month...the individual violated that contract so they froze the account to prevent a ton of XRP being dumped on the market.

Your second point is valid, I am not 100% sure what that statement means in context. It could mean needing to remove anonymity, or it could just be talking about the protocols used to ensure a non-existent account doesn't place false transactions on the network. I will have to educate myself further on that matter.

The third part is really simple: Ya know how you pay miners transaction fees? The wallet reserve serves that purpose and that purpose alone. The thing is that validating nodes can fee vote to lower the XRP reserve amount at any time. But the intent was to prevent creating numerous accounts to congest the network and to prevent other attacks. I can understand disliking it, but it serves a purpose."

It also means that if u're participating in the ecosystem u're autmatically sharing the bigger chunk of the network effect and, thus, wealth transfer from old system of money to Ripple Labs. Corporate charity. It's a free market after all"
"To your first point: No they can't give themselves any amount they want because the total supply was pre-mined...no more than 100 billion will ever exist.

Second, the amount they hold is frozen in an escrow contract...meaning it is 100% illiquid, and can only have 1 billion come out of escrow at a time which is only used to sell to financial institutions or exchanges that want to follow something like Washington States new crypto regulations.

Third, you can't give yourself something you already own....but it is of no value if you don't do anything with it and is only money on paper...meaning that there is zero reason to hold onto all of it for the long term unless fiat completely implodes on itself in the immediate future."
You are the reason why this subreddit is starting to sound like a T_D discussion
"No, their coins are in escrow, to be dealt out over a long period of time.

If XRP somehow hits $100 it will have ""won"" the crypto game, their market cap will be insane."
That I can't say as I don't know for sure...and won't pretend to know since I want to keep the conversation honest.
The current price of XRP represents the price that the NEXT PERSON will pay to buy the NEXT UNIT of XRP. It is in no way a guarantee that the entire XRP stock could be liquidated at that price. Long term if Ripple Labs tries to liquidate their holdings then the price will fall in response, but markets operate in the short term, and in the short term people are willing to pay $2+/XRP so it's not that ridiculous.
"you just called his analysis ""Bootiful"" and now you're saying it really doesn't matter how factually wrong it is because the ""average investor"" doesn't understand anyway.

"It is? At the time I did my research it wasn't, at least there was no connection between the digital asset ""XRP"" and the RippleNet services. Just got myself a short refresh and noticed, their xRapid service (in development) indeed uses XRP. One should still not confuse the asset XRP with Ripple/RippleNet services.

People talk about how ""Banks will adopt Ripple"" and inaccurately think, that is equal to ""Banks will adopt XRP""."
Because request network will be PayPal 2.0 lol
XRP is used as an asset transfer mechanism that gets burned. The token itself should have zero value.
Digital tokens > Stocks
True, hence the fact that I said it is never ever sustainable. Ripple labs will slowely liquidate those coins, and they wont get the full 100b obvious: ergo >2$ XRP is ridiculous.
"No idea, but remember there is one single company that holds 60 billion of them. For that reason alone there isnt as much grow room as most ripple fans seem to think. 

if it goes to $100, that means Ripple labs has 6 fucking trillion of liquid assets. Thats complete fucking bonkers."
Well they either made 100b or thr price isnt sustainable above 2 and it will come back down. Im thinking xrp will come back down, but hey the new people seem to love it so who knows.
if you are okay paying ridiculous fees then go ahead, some of us are looking forward to a brighter future.
"Thats kind of the point, essentially anybody holding XRP would be ""the bank"" instead of one specific bank."
It is 55 billion, but the contracts are set up so that 1 billion is released each month until the supply is gone as the OP mentioned...was specifically talking about how each contract goes back into a 54 month escrow period and doesn't go back into their pockets like they were implying.
It may be infuriating but it is rational behavior
As most people know, he knows but doesn't think it'll ever happen to him... until it does.
Except if you took the time to read about account freezes, you'd realize it isn't Ripple that actually has the power to freeze a trust line...takes 5 minutes to actually look it up rather than parrot what you have heard others say.
Tethers are the same. Can be frozen at anytime
Hey, and that is a totally valid concern. I am just looking at the benefits of freeing up 27 trillion dollars so that it can be placed into the narrow money band, or the utility it can add if mass adoption occurs since it can reduce the need to print more fiat if everyone is using it as a currency that coincides with that countries fiat currency. That is my take on the matter and everyone is free to have their own opinion and not be berated for it.
Cardano shill spotted
"What do you think is different?  I have been struggling to see the difference.  That is why a good portion of the BTC community doesn't believe in LN.  We have already seen a network that works in that manner, and it leads to what it leads to..  

Ripple wasn't always what it has evolved to be.   It was always kinda suspect, with a lot of pre-mine and such -- but it eventually turned it's backs on the  crypto community and cozied up to those with money..  In order to work it needs large actors with lots of connections.  Those large actors tend to be banks..   LN is going to have the same issues..  One cannot just open channels for everyone they do business with -- It's too expensive to move BTC- and most commerce insn't bi-directional..    So you find one large trusted entity who will have bidirectional connections to lots of entities you need to do business with...   And that leads to centralization.."
No it's not. Because no one uses XRP for anything. It's totally speculative. Banks don't use XRP, they use a private ripple implementation.
"Earlier this summer, I listened to a podcast with the Ripple CEO that was a couple years old. I wish I'd saved it, because I haven't been able to find it anywhere since.

Anyway, he talked about the amount of money that banks keep in overseas branches in various countries that just sit around not making interest and unable to do anything, because of something to do with helping international customers or transfers or something. I don't remember the specifics, but I do vividly remember that he said that banks keep something like $10 TRILLION just sitting around collecting dust because that's the only way they can move money quickly and efficiently across borders. And Ripple integration with their systems is a way to solve that.

It sounded extremely convincing at the time as a business model that was solving a very real problem, as OP said. I recommend reading up on the company before judging too harshly, because it sounded brilliant to me. 

That said, I'm not defending the price of XPR itself. The CEO did specifically say in the interview that banks are not obligated to use XRP even if they're working together on this international business type stuff. I don't know how/if that has changed at all, but the business application is wider than just helping a few Japanese banks move money. You have to think of it in much broader business terms. 

Also worth noting that banking is as slow as any industry to adopt any new technology, so the fact that Ripple has been around for several years means that their deals may start to actually take shape. A brand new crypto could come out with the exact same promises and better tech, but then not finalize a single contract for 5-6 years. 

Anyway, I'm just trying to clear up a few things based on what I heard him say on the podcast. You can knock XRP, but the company and it's solutions seems to be pretty on point, IMHO

((EDIT: adding that I just saw further down this thread that the amount of money just sitting around doing nothing is closer to $27 TRILLION. I knew it was an absolutely unbelievable number when I heard it. Not sure where that commenter got his source, but the rest of the comment was pretty detailed, so he may be correct. That's the scale of money this company could potentially help banks free up. One hell of a pie.))"
It’s not necessarily about the amount of people directly using  it’s about the amount of money in those banks.  Which is affected by the amount of people.
But the power of banks comes from fees and interest. Wont nearly free transactions take away their power? pardon all the questions, it's kinda confusing zzzz
Haha I know right? Got super excited there for a sec...

"Yeah we all know fiat is debt based but that is completely non-sequitur to whether Ripple releasing trillions of dollars worth of premine into the economy is a good thing. 

It's a good thing for the people that own those specific tokens, and for people who wisely stayed far away from ripple. As for the other benefits you list, the other cryptos solve those same issues the same or better. "
"This is part of the problem, everyone lumping all cross border payments together and using trillions to base their valuation assumptions on. There is a massive difference between xCurrent and xRapid.

Use JPMorgan as an example, unlikely to use xRapid to any great degree, may possibly use xCurrent. To the extent they do use xCurrent, XRP would be the cost of processing a message it doesn’t feature as a cross currency. If the cost of sending that message is greater than say Swift for example or alternatives, then they are less likely to use Ripple at all.

Contrast with, I don’t know, Bank of Guatemala who may have limited cross border and agent bank infrastructure but may want to support a bit of cross border trade in a country they don’t have infrastructure, then they may use xRapid. This is not the trillions that everyone refers to."
One look at coinmarketcap will show you that that isn't necessarily true. :)

"Exactly. Ripple seems to be a solution to multi-bank transaction fees (and breaks down the trust between banks.), and wants to preserve the current financial system as is, rather than moving forward into ""the future"". I kinda _get_ why it's being adopted so quickly and widely, though. It conserves a very big market - debt. (tinfoil hat on) Ripple is not a threat, unlike _true_ decentralised crypto."

Real cryptos are networks for the people by the people.  Ripple is run by a single centralized controlled all-powerful company, not for the benefit of the people but for the banks.  It's sad to see so many people speculating in it, especially when the founders are taking billions in value.
"Thanks for writing this. yes, I can believe what you are saying, 

But you also make the point that they specifically said, banks don't have to use XRP (and why would they?). 

Look, I believe Ripple Labs was early in this game, found their niche with banks, and good for them for making $$ integrating this into the world's top core banking platforms (and likely charging a royalty fee / license fee for the usage) and solving a real world problem. 

BUT, I find it extremely shady that they have made next to no disclosure as to how XRP is actually being used or under what exact use cases it is going to be used... and why would they? They have billions of the tokens (60% of all tokens) and are selling them making millions daily. 

They must be laughing all the way to the bank."
That's super interesting, I hadn't heard that, thanks for sharing!
"This is my main issue with XRP token. There are only two stated use cases. 

The first is an anti-spamming measure, which would require accounts to hold 20 XRP. That's not enough to create significant demand.

The second stated case is as an intermediary asset to replace the US dollar, which is stable and liquid, whereas XRP is not. The intermediary asset could have been something like the Dai Coin, or even Tether if Tether were honest. 

But instead, we have XRP as an intermediary asset, which would (A) need to be inflated to provide $5 trillion in liquidity and (B) then stabilized somehow. Banks are risk-averse and have no incentive to do this. 

XRP could have created its own stable coin for its intermediary asset. Why didn't they do this? You have to ask yourself why they didn't go that route, since it's obvious to anyone thanks risk-averse banks are not going to transact in an unstable and illiquid intermediary asset."

"Releasing fiat into the economy... not xrp!

Having xrp sitting in nostro is better than having fiat sitting in nostro... two different things.

The xrp issuance is the equivalent of a central bank issuing. Ee money or a govtbissuing new bonds... but without jo mainstreet having to pay interest on it."
"Have a look at a post called xrp's drake eqn.

U right ... for xborder settlements a v high proportion out of the 11000 banks on the swift network are transactionsfrom mega banks...

Bit the readon for this is that today smaller banks wanting to go from bank A to Bank Z have to go via the megabanks and the bank of int settlements. 

Xrp alliws going point to point and as such, the amount mega banks are settling will reduce -- so even if the mega banks dont adopt xrp.., it's still a sizeable chunk when yhe mega vanks arent needed as proxies no more"
Here, a SWIFT/IBAN transfer costs approximately $7.5 USD. And it takes a day mostly, or two to 3 if you transfer it Fridays. 
I'm not saying anything. I wasn't talking about any technical details. I'm not savvy like that. I was merely making a point, he didn't argue his counter points, that is that.
"> Second, the amount they hold is frozen in an escrow contract

You realize what the word ""escrow"" means, right? Escrow is when something is held by a third party so two other parties can complete a transaction. If Ripple Labs is one party, who is the other? It sounds like that was just a word inserted to make the situation appear more palatable which is: they hold over 50% of the pre-mined currency supply, but only give themselves access to 1 billion of the units per month, then if they decide to follow through on their own promise, which isn't binding in any forcible way, they'll lock back up units they couldn't sell off for a profit in some other currency to be released to themselves again at a future date to try again.

Would that be a fair assessment?

>Third, you can't give yourself something you already own....but it is of no value if you don't do anything with it and is only money on paper

I agree. It makes no sense to control 100% of a currency supply if you're the only one that uses it! What gives currency, ANY currency, value if the fact that many others also value it. It does, in that situation, make sense to control as much of the currency supply as possible, if you're the one in control.

everyone's a shill, eh?
"The system sounds overly complex. It doesn't need to be. They are hiding the true function behind their backs for a reason...it's typical to what banks do with current currencies. 

All the money still funnels through this one point. It's inherently flawed a thousand different ways. How do you think this is going to end? "
"What you're saying makes zero sense.  No one is hating.  We're saying we should educate people.   

You get angry at my opinion, rail against it and then curse me out while wanting me to respect your opinion.  Sorry, the WHOLE crypto community should inform everyone as to what Ripple is.  It has nothing to do with it pumping.  The truth is, because it's not decentralized and is pushed by one company, the FEDS used to throw people in jail for that.  The fact that they haven't with Ripple is odd.  It's the first ever currency that isn't decentralizes where they haven't done that."
"So you go and weight in in false accusation of that idiot? I have no ripple, and even if I had I put my money where I want. Repeat, it is my business where I put my money.

You guys cannot hope for one-way liberty. If someone wants to buy whatever they want, so be it, it is a free world, or it should be. What we can hope for is to inform in a proper manner, build a FAQ, make a video, etc, just not with hatred threads to look like those core idiots. This is negative for us and make it look like we are just the same sort of blind maximalists. Whenever a coin pump, we go and hate... nah, that sux.

BCH will stand on its own soon enough."
Maybe It is you who is the idiot. 
Not if there's another gateway that hasn't enabled freezes or isn't compliant with the request.  I agree it's not ideal, but it would be almost trivial to circumvent.  Especially as the network grows--imagine you had a potential escape route through 75% of the banks in the world.  Or simply exchange into another crypto.  It's pretty weak, I think.  Still, you are right, it is a significant trade-off.
Banks will adapt both, we're in the transition phase

Hello? A permissioned distributed ledger is a database. 
Agree with you completely. Here’s my response to XRP haters: “If you having crypto probs, I feel bad for you son.. cause I got 99+ XRP and you ain’t got one” lol
Exactly like you said, the FUD is due to their myopic vision and missing the gains.
"1 - I don't care if people make money.

2 - I am not angry AT ALL. What is bothering me is it's not supposed to be a crypto since it's centralized (it's the opposite of what this industry is all about). 

3 - Please tell me how I was proven wrong? A quick 15 minutes google search will show you excatly what I stated above. Lol?"
"Haha wow master trole

No we wsnt people to know that Ripple is a 100 billion dolllar sql database"
Lol they mad economics turned around and showed them who was boss. Did they really think a decentralized currency with divided and scammy developers would over take the US dollar and fiat currencies??
Maybe you should, otherwise no wonder that they exist when people are uninformed about them and how they operate ...
I was involved with ripple well before the whole banking focus.  It was kinda cool back then -- They pretty much dumped the Crypto community in favor of those with $$
"I don't have bank account...I used coin.ph and its easy..
I don't have a bank coz its hard and its far away in our place...I tried e banking but wont let you register untit have bank atm, bank book etc.. and I don't have one but thanks to Crypto... it makes posible"
Banks are already adopting XRP in Japan and Korea. This is just the beginning. 
"Yeah I get you. But think about one thing: some new guy comes in, read the subreddits for some time, one is a meme pool bashing BCH, the other is topic after topic bashing BTC and other coins. So, they will just stay away and will not read the much needed educational threads.

Do you now what made me get away from BTC? There was so much hate against BCH from charlie lee and other trolls in tweeter, that it really called my attention and I thought there was something very wrong *with them*.

Luckly I was already in crypto for some time, so I went to check in all information possible about the issues.

My whole point: let's not turn into that, because right now there are half dozen topics all saying why ripple is a crap.

Suggestion: let's work together in a comparison of all projects out there, from a neutral stand point, and concentrate in one place for new comers.

edit: consider that this is coming from a master troll like myself :)"
"Just because their around doesn't mean you need to use them. I see them dieing in the future if they dont change their fiscal ways of double spending and fractional reserve banking. In the future banks will make little to no money which is how they always should have been. 
There will never be crypto loans unless they are faciliated through government fiat i.e. backed by government fiat. Crypto was specifically made to completely eliminate double spending, which causes all the problems banks have in the first place."
"I'm not an ass, thanks.

I'm a bit deceived by BCH (I DO support) decreasing in value and market cap/vol every day.

Yup. But some coins have long term value, making it much easier for noobs to cash out.
Then you either dont understand ripple or didnt read the gdax digital asset frame work document. XRP is a concentrated premined currency running on a centralized network.
"To me it matters as I’ve done my due diligence. I don’t give two shits about others who just put skin in the game without bothering to do just a little extra work. But if someone has and still has questions we’ll that’s another story.

As I type this I realize it’s hopeless with people on here for the most part, either naive or blinded by ideology. 

L8R days nuff said

"
Bitstamp froze his fiat residing in their (Bitstamps) internal system you, not Ripple. Ripple asked Bitstamp to do it regarding a legal dispute, but Bitstamp pressed the button. They = Bitstamp. Bitstamp had a choice. This would be no different then if Bitstamp reversed/froze a BCH transaction you made on their exchange.
You need to do more research then. One of Ripple’s payment settlement systems runs on xrp tokens that gets partially burned when used each time. Banks have to buy XRP and use them for payment transfers. That’s why everyone in Asia is buying xrp and holding, they see its value long term when banks use xrp.
BTC now openly touts itself as a possible reserve currency for banks.  I think there is some overlap in articulated use cases.
"As someone familiar with the banking side of things...Ripple will almost undoubtedly replace SWIFT as the standard of international transfers. That I think we can count on. What that means for its value, and what use it may have beyond that I can't speak for.

But it will replace SWIFT. International wire transfers will be near instant and nearly free."

">  Ripple Labs since they are the origin of all XRP.

"> But the intent was to prevent creating numerous accounts to congest the network and to prevent other attacks. I can understand disliking it, but it serves a purpose.

No, it doesn't. Not in cryptocurrencies. You should be able to create as many accounts as you want. In Bitcoin there are 2^160 possible accounts. The universe will freeze before we consume them all. Creating accounts is not an attack vector, as obviously for an account to exist it needs to have money in it. Plus a transaction needs to be sent and payed for. So an attacker can only do so many. 

Convince me this requirement was not purposely added to undermine privacy, please.

> Your second point is valid, I am not 100% sure what that statement means in context. It could mean needing to remove anonymity, or it could just be talking about the protocols used to ensure a non-existent account doesn't place false transactions on the network.

The previous statement obviously mean personal identification through documentation. ""Non-existent accounts"" shouldn't be able to provide a valid signature for a transaction, this is a non-problem.  
I remember Ripple demanded those who had received the giveaway to either identify themselves or sell before a certain date. 

That's a critical point. If to use Ripple you have to verify yourself, and plus your account can be frozen (it doesn't matter if by Ripple Labs or a ""gateway""), that's just a bank account, not crypto."

"Actually, while no one gets the fees, every XRP holder benefits from the fees since eventually they reduce supply and drive up the price for all XRP.

"So Ripple labs gets to be the sole profiteer of all fees. One entity. And don't worry that they CAN freeze accounts, because right now when they are new and trying to gain adoption they totally won't. Sounds like Google all over again.

"This makes absolutely no sense, we're talking about mistrust in banks/governments because they can create money supply snd inflation at will. Doesn't really matter who does it. Inflation should be created with production, not because a government needs handouts prior to an election.

How will ripple (not it's fuel token, xrp) prevent that from happening in a chain that doesn't have nakamoto consensus or similar?"
"I don't understand how it is not controlled by banks when it targets banks and they only sell to financial institutions (what is not sold is put back to the scrow contract).

Moreover it is potentially inflationary despite the argument presented. If demand exceeds the 1 billion released every month, then it will be inflationary. And once all 100 billion are released it will be inflationary too. 

If one entity can block the funds of an individual... That's a considerable concern. 
But what I can't still understand is what is xrp useful for any end user."

Good question.  I just learned to day you need an ID to even use their system.  Yet they have no problem selling their token to anonymous speculators.
Ripple has been around for longer than most shitcoins of today.

Yes, not a traditional cyrptocurrency. My bet is Coinbase still lists it for reasons above. 
Makes wire transfers slightly cheaper for banks. Don't expect them to pass on the savings.
What's the price if listed on Coinbase in January? If a big retailer adopts it?

Today nobody can look into my bank account, but if someone knows my BTC wallet address, knows everything about what I do with my money.

People here is also obsessed with getting rid of the banks, ok, good luck getting credit and a mortgage with a deflationary coin without banks. And good luck trying to hide your money from the government.

And if it’s used anonymously as cash, is just promoting tax evasion."
Yeah, so what's the difference when they can prevent you from cashing out the XRP you have? The effect is the same as if they frozen the XRP itself.

reddit. what can you do ...
"Thanks for writing that up man.

I see it as problematic at least that xrp fluctuates and thus the asset I receive as a bank always has a different value in the end than the one that was supposed to be sent to me.

You say this situation is not very different from the current FX spot market, but isn't that the whole reason parties decide to transact in USD so that always 1 USD = 1 USD. Even if you want Euro's, FX markets are closed on the weekend, giving you a somewhat stablepriceview to trade against.

I just don't see (I am an economy noob so maybe the bankers see something I don't) why I as a money handling party - let alone a big bank - would make myself vulnerable to something like xrp in light of the above.

EDIT: Thinking of this just now. Also as a bank I wouldn't want to hold xrp very long before sending it, because if I buy 1mil usd xrp now on the open market, I might be able to send that tomorrow to bank B as only 900k since the price has gone down. The same goes for the receiving bank. i would want to get out of xrp asap because right now I can still get 1 mil for it but maybe tomorrow I won't. Doesn;t this create an extra hassle of having to deal with some kind of exchange mechanism, party that would have to able and want to exchange those xrp to usd pretty much immediately, or give the bank an IOU for the same amount (but then hello to IOU's again)."
They don't seem to realize they _are_ the little guy.
I'm certainly not walking around telling everyone how butt hurt I am that they exist.
"55%, and it is escrowed away. 

1 billion is released monthly for them to sell to banks, because major banks are not going to hit up binance to buy some. Any coins not sold that month are subsequently re-escrowed for the remaining months.

"> XRP still has value as a fast and nearly free transfer of value from person A to person B

That's because it's essentially a glorified MySQL database replicated to multiple trusted servers. You need to verify your identity to participate and your funds can be frozen or reverted by Ripple any time."
yeah but how are the banks gonna keep control when XRP provides nearly free transactions? Are banks willing to get a massive paycut?
"So you're blaming me for central banks existing because I'm not that annoying guy that's always going on about how horrible central banking is?

idk, perhaps its just a difference in opinion, but I'd personally rather go around talking about things I like than ragging on things I don't like."
Haha well why would they do something that is not in their interest?
Clearly they made the right decision, this was MUCH more profitable for them.
fwiw, it's 55 billion.  just gunna limit it to 1 billion a month.

Hi. That's a unique definition of a database you have.
The people behind it are donating their coins to charities and otherwise reusing profits to expand the Ripple infrastructure. If you don't see how putting your coins in escrow for timed releases stabilizes the value of the currency then you're missing basic economics at work. Further, the fact they premined their coins and can make a profit is like arguing tax cuts for corporations means they won't reinvest in their corporation, product, or employees and will only HODL the gains for stock options. I suggest you look into Adam Smith and Keyne's economic theories in greater detail. Along with taking a basic psychology course. Bitcoin was like the first Protestant shared farm lots in the early American colonial times. Ripple is like investing in a Rockefeller railroad owned company. Do you see the difference now?
It will reduce their income but also their expenses on transactions  while also saving money by firing unneeded employees...

"Ripple has been around for a long time.   It solves the problem that LN is supposed to solve -- only between any set of asset classes..  It has it's place, but that doesn't make it a viable  competitor to BTC or BCH.. 

I see Lightning network as a rippoff of Ripple.."

"I asked from some btc a very long time ago but it was for the smallest amount possible so I could see how it all worked. I think it was like 10 cents worth or something.  I was very graitful for that at the time though. 

Got me looking into mining (to late for that cash cow) I just run a BCH node now not much else I can do to help sadly."

"I very reluctantly purchased $100 worth of Ripple earlier today for my girlfriend on her instance, and placed it into a wallet that she downloaded to her mac.

This is my experience:

What a sad and dangerous joke ripple seems to be... there are only 2 wallets of any relevance... the first is written in javascript and is only available on github https://github.com/jatchili/minimalist-ripple-client (which has not been updated in over 3 years), the second is based on that same javascript version... which you download from toastwallet.com (which has only been online for a couple of months now... yikes!)

And what a joke that toastwallet was... first they ask you to create a pin... then they ask you to pick a password... then you are forced to pick a ""seed"" which is only 6 random ""words"" madeup of random characters like ""hewue"" and crap like that (terrible seed word practices, the eff does an excellent writeup on the matter at https://www.eff.org/dice ) 

And THEN (get this!) they tell you multiple times... ""THIS SEED WORD IS USELESS WITHOUT A BACKUP! PLEASE TAKE A BACKUP"" (why the fuck did they force us to pick a 6 word seed then? What is it seeding? Why doesn't the backup just seed itself?)

So by now we have created and saved:

a 6 digit PIN number

a password

a seed phrase

a JSON ""backup of the wallet""

Seems a little redundant... or seems like the person who wrote this wallet has no idea what a seed phrase or a deterministic wallet even is.

So we bought the $100 of ripple, and now we have to send it to her account. No fees, GREAT! This is the future (tm)!

I sent it as a withdrawal from the exchange 3 hours ago now, and her wallet still isn't ""activated"" yet.

Oh, and this is the best part! $100 only bought her ~57 ripple (she's made a few bucks and she is through the roof happy which is awesome!) ... but she is forced to keep 20 ripple in her account to ""prevent spam on the network"".

So really... she can only ever spend 37 ripple.

And if the 20 ripple are in her account to stop spam on the network... why has it taken 3 hours for the ripple she purchased to show up in her account?

tl;dr ... buy some ripple if only to profit from the bankster pump and dump, but their technology and their values are absolute CRAP... and they should be removed from coinmarketcap.com imho.

They are not a crypto coin that allows you access to your wealth that can never be revoked. They are a centralized digital version of company scrip essentially."
"Some info:

- xrp is not used by the banks

- Ripple (the company) is promoting their network (not xrp currently) to the banks, the Ripple network is basically swift 2.0 to transfer funds (again, not xrp atm), so banks can build their apps on top of their network and allow users to send funds faster using Ripple network instead of swift. Note: the banks can allow xrp option in their Ripple network but it's stupid to do so since it's very volatile 

- Ripple network success has nothing to do with XRP, I believe xrp price rise is fully speculation and confused people thinking banks are using XRP.

TL;DR: I believe Ripple network will replace swift soon

XRP will crash "

To those making tons of profits with these xrp rides: good for you!

I am neither buying nor encouraging any of these ripple shills and hope the BitcoinX communities stick together to fight back."
"I agree. Ripple is the real enemy here not BCH or btc. 
This is how banks will take us down and this vision we had of decentralized money will be a thing u tell your grand kids about as they get paid in ripple or some other central shit. If this infighting doesn't stop it's going to kill both coins and we all will be losers. "
dude relax it's a premine p&d coin having another moment in the spotlight. check back in a week or two. also a lot of dumb noob money that recently came in yet to figure out what kind of bags they've bought.
Ripple company has the power to just generate money does it not?  How is that not dangerous?
"Thank you for writing this up. I was just thinking about this earlier today. 

What's our 5th rule in this subreddit? If you don't own your private keys, you don't own your coins. When ripple gets hacked, they are going to get wrecked and print more coins.

"And you think that btc and the blockchain is the illumination? It costs a hell of a lot energy and transaction costs are huge!

Beside of this the blockchain technology is also something we can talk about. All nodes that maintain the blockchain do exactly the same thing. A million time! They all verifying the same transaction, they record the same thing. For me it sounds everything else then effective."
I don't like the fact that RippleLABS possess ~60 billion XRP (~$160 billion), even that they can only flood the market with 1 billion XRP at the time I personally don't like that such power is in the hand of the owner. Just compare this in proportion to the fact that someone could flood the BTC market with ~500 000 BTC each month for sixty months with would most likely kill the market!
I mean let the game rollout and let's see what  will happen...
I knew that the owners had tons of ripple, but did not know that they sold it for profit every month. Seems like a huge crash is coming
"Best way for people to be educated is to let them invest in it and learn the difference by experiencing the consequences.

No. Just keep building on what we have. It is far more important. Let them live in la la land while we build. Just don't sell your own coin short. 
"1) Ripple
2) The XRP is removed from the ledger entirely
3) Too ambiguous
4) Go look at the founders if you honestly don't know.
5) If you mean XRP or their tech in general, yes as there are third party validation nodes right now.
6) Not a question.

Trustlines are only applicable to using the XRP ledger for non-ripple transactions...transmitting just XRP requires no trust lines to exist btw...so if using it solely for XRP transactions, it is trustless...it just isn't as decentralized as it could be...but I can say the same thing about bitcoin and the fact it only takes 5 mining pools acting in bad faith to perform a 51% attack."
I love all of this excitement. 
^ The comment of someone with nothing of worth to say. Cant even follow a comment thread.
"What's the problem with mining now what card/cpu do you have?

I find it very intriguing that when ripple goes up 800% in one month, it's all over the media. Except that this time they don't call it a bubble. :) 
u/don-wonton you think you could do a video on this?
XRP has managed to create a giant troll army ready to defend their books at all times.  Want to criticize XRP in any forum?  The XRP troll army will downvote all criticism of XRP and upvote all defenses of XRP. 
Flavor of the month.... Koreans as a nation decided they wanted to pump a coin and take everyone else's money. *evil genius* 🤑
You divide the btc community and now you cry wolf.
Nice theory. Btc vs. Bch == divide and conquer by Ripple.
They can lock your funds without any questioning, did that happened already ? yes they locked in 2016 some transaction that occured on bitstamp, they thought it was Jed who was selling his XRPs...
Also the private bank contrat between Ripple Inc and Banks stipulate that the only place where they can buy XRPs is from Ripple and not from exchanges. What does this mean ? it means even if banks will use XRP they will not ever buy it from exchanges. 
"What percentage founders have ? 20% of all XRPs in existence are in the hand of the founders and 60% in the hands of the company.
So yes the 38 billion you are seeing right now INCLUDE the 20% XRPs of the creators. "
"Will it be listed on coinbase?
While you can argue that XRP is dencentralized or not, you can not tell that : 
XRP had a fair distribution 
Not premined
Those are among the criteria for being listed on Gdax (coinbase), so now XRP will never ever ever be listed on coinbase unless they change their rules..."
People are hypocrites, 99% of them are here because they want to make a profit, not because they think they are going to get rid of banks. They are getting angry because they missed the XRP train, they also got angry when they missed profiting from BCH, XVG, IOTA, etc... Now it’s XRP’s turn and suddenly they became crypto purists.
It's the fact that it's low priced.  I know people who sold all bitcoin litecoin and moved into ripple because at 1.00 you can imagine the return if it hits 10.00.  There's no analysis being done on the technical side of ripple. It's just all the people who missed out on bitcoin at 1.00 are now going into ripple before they miss out.  These are just straight speculators jumping ship from bitcoin to ripple. They're going to cash out once they hit it big. Get in now with your finger on the trigger to cash out.
"But them Ripples spinners is not decentralized!!!! 

*exchanges bitcoin for dollars using Coinbase with a linked bank account and pays taxes for it*"
Paypal 2.0 = Request Network
Tis all speculation, there's a rumor that XRP will be added to GDAX early in January.  After that XRP will likely settle back to $1ish levels.
The only incentive is keeping fast transaction times for non-financial institutions from what I am aware....that and making the process decentralized. The more people that run validation nodes, the less worried individuals have to be about a central authority controlling the ledger.
Ho dat? Cash me outside if you can. Ho dat!
Wallow in your self pity and count your losses
Bitcoin Miners are incentivized though.. they play by the rules to make more money.. how does ripple nodes stay incentivized? Just an honest question.. trying to learn as much about ripple as I can.
Catch me outside.  How bout that.
The company sells 1B coins to the public each month for the next 55 months. What do these coins do? Not much. Their tech may be used by banks, XRP will not. There’s a difference between the company and the coins. It’s a damn shame. 
"Wrong information out there. Xrp is a security and a DLT. Of course has nothing to do with the original cypherpunk idea and it is something created to help the banks to solve a global problem (others can make similar things as Stellar for example)
So, as a project it is a good idea but not as a crypto currency as a lot of people know about them.
XRP has a lot of cons but a lot of pros too (legal issues are out of scope as they don't have that problem, for example)."

Yup
"There actually is a moral argument fir xrp...

It's to do with freeing up $27 trillion locked up in nostro accounts.

A $10 xrp is quntifiable based on tangible assumptions without speculation given the 5 tr dollars of x-border settlements, the 27 tr dollars locked up in nostro accounts alone.
It also enables 95% of the 11000 banks on the swift network to transfer peer to peer instead of proxying cross border through the mega-banks.

Xrp can do a lot of good...! Fiat is debt based... mainly issued to governments and we all pay the interest. We are paying bong debt via put taxes for $27 trillion which is locked up... without getting benefit... xrp can release some of that... and that's a good thing... surely"
Cross border payments and settlements.
Ahh.. I apologize that my assumption was very limited to developed countries like US. I can see why crypto might be awesome for you especially then. Good for you being onboard the crypto train ahead of the rest of the world! I have friends who still don’t believe in it. It’s not BTC vs XRP, it’s more like crypto vs. fiat or stock market investments if you ask me. lol 
"I have always been a bitcoin maximalist. Ultimately I think there will be one crypto that takes the lions share and is most widely used as money. It is inefficient for people to be using many different forms of money and I think one day we will settle on a single crypto. I think it will be based on the bitcoin ledger due to the network effects and history, but I am not convinced it will be BTC. I only hold BCH so I may be biased but I think that is the version of Bitcoin that has the best prospects to become the one world currency. 

I dont have an opinion on XMR. It obviously has utility and therefor value for private transactions but I dont hold any.

I dont know a lot about the details on STEEM but the concept is interesting. I struggle to comprehend how a token that is for a specific purpose will have an advantage over a token that is widely used as money. If BCH becomes the #1 coin and is widely used and accepted, what would be the purpose of have site specific tokens? Couldnt a site integrate BCH to reward all readers and contributors and eliminate the conversions from STEEM-BCH and back? Maybe I fail to understand the steem incentives and model.

Smart contracts seem to be useful and have a lot of potential, but again I don't see the value of having a separate token. I believe that if the Core developers were more inviting and easier to work with, Vitalik would have built Ethereum on top of the bitcoin block chain. I like some of the things I hear that are coming from the Ethereum ecosystem but I am not sold on having a separate token for every single idea that is running on top of Ethereum."
"Very little detail to reinforce one's own ideology in hopes of driving up the price of BTC is transparent. It's okay, though. Not going to trash other coins, each are here for different purposes, but one common thread is to make money for whatever purpose that may be. 

EDIT: The reality is that everything literally everything that exists outside the mainstream and makes it into the mainstream (especially something that threatens the very system that has been in place for decades) eventually gets integrated into the system and this includes BTC and every other altcoin out there. XRP just happened to have been developed to integrate into an already existing system and will in some way revolutionize the banking system something you do not want to hear, but true. 

I feel your pain man, ideology and a vision of what the world could really be like by destroying the system is a great vision to have. Take it from an old punk rocker from the late 70s and early 80s who wanted to fuck the system up in a big way. We were wildly naive. Over time even punk bands were integrated into the system because it became mainstream and record companies saw it could make them money. This is one such example. 

I am not saying give up the struggle, just don't be blinded by ideology to the point of making mistakes. If you want to make money, make it then use it in alternative ways. "
Who cares. 
Dumb money.

If you can't mine it or set up your own node, it's not decentralized.  If a company selects who can mine or run full nodes, then it's a company coin.
Ripple just isn't a cryptocurrency, not an open blockchain. For what is worth u can try to convince coinmarketcap.com delist it
Hold. Trust in fundamentals. Froth always settles.
"Fuck all these ""token"" coins. Teather too."
How about Ben Lawsky too, just added him to the board of directors of ripple. Don't know who he is? Google him.
"I would tend to ignore XRP. As you say, it is not decentralised, their blockchain is useless since the company can change whatever they want, and XRP is unused.

How to ignore it: removing it from coinmarketcap. Stopping its spread over exchanges (for instance, it is so far from the definition of a cryptocurrency that GDAX will not offer it, it does not fit their guidelines).

Who knows how to contact coinmarketcap with these reasons?

"
"> It also requires verified user identification in order to use the network

At all? I saw you can have a wallet in Ledger. So how does this work? If I just create a Ledger wallet and have XRP sent it, will it be frozen until I authenticate with Ripple? Or won't the transfer even clear?

What about all these exchanges trading XRP? Are they forced to require papers from users that buy the currency? Or as long as you leave it in the exchange you're fine?"

"In the spirit of being a devil's advocate, I think I can refute most of these concerns, but one I have not been able to find any good info on is this:

>huge premine of 70% of XRP tokens which are slowly unlocked

I cannot actually find anything that explains how the tokens are distributed, other than reference to some ""giveaways"" in the early days.  In most regards, Ripple/XRP is not centralized (despite the FUD), as no central authority selects ""chosen validators"".  But it does indeed look like Ripple Labs minted the full supply of the tokens and distributes them ""on a schedule"" to parties of their discretion.  Do they sell them?  Give them away?  My Google-fu is failing me.  Either way, that does indeed put them in a role of central bank.  That doesn't give them power over transactions, but it does allow them to effectively gatekeep the system (until the last tokens enter circulation, anyway).  "

"Most of you guys are absolutely right, Ripple is far away from the initial idea of Bitcoin.

But it is kinda hilarious to me that you guys complain about Banksters and decentralization, while Bitcoin got infiltrated by banks, big cooperations (blockstream) and is basically controlled by mining cartels. 

I hold a variety of coins, all coins that I believe in, including XRP and Bcash. But guys, do yourself a favor and stop this god damn ""bitcoin-religion-master-race-bullsh't"".

Best,
Luu"
Just because ripple doesn’t fit in with the bitcoin libertarian vision doesn’t mean it shouldn’t exist. PayPal has its place, bitcoin has its place, and ripple is finding its own. It may not be a crypto in a purist sense, but then again neither is iota. They’re all lumped together because they’re somewhat similar
This didn't educate me of anything. Ripple is a settlement layer right? That's all I know. 
Why do they have this currency listed and available for private people to buy, isn't that superfluous to their business model? 
You're quite uninformed, and I am pretty surprised how this post could get so many upvotes.
"Irrational exuberance plus cognitive dissonance says that once you bet on any horse, no matter the odds, you are convinced that horse will win.

But logic says that once that horse is trailing by 30%, you will likely question your bet, noticing that the horse has a broken leg and keeps veering off the track, and is basically unsuitable for racing.

Thanks for this discussion. I think I'll stick to healthy purebreds and warn others the same."
Wow you are wildly uneducated on Ripple and XRP. 
I think it would be a good thing for Ripple to knock BTC out of the top spot.  It will create greater scrutiny of ALL the coins by prospective investors and IMO expose BTC for what is really is.  The effect of this IMO will help BCH.
"XRP is the future, decentralized coins are still very immature technology in the grand scheme of things, XRP will win short term, decentralized networks will win long term AFTER it has matured to the point of overcoming its current obstacles.

Ripple has a plan to become more decentralized than BTC which 51% stake is controlled by just 5 mining pools.  Ripple has RCL blockchain which it is not pushing as a priority right now.  Ripple validators are less prone to malicious attack since validators are chosen based on merit compared to BTC's PoW.

Earlier this year, Ripple laid claim to match the transaction output of Visa, the world’s largest payments network with 70k transactions at an average time of 3.7 seconds."
I'm wondering, what are the requirements to be listed on Coinmarketcap, and should technologies like Ripple really be listed there?

"I hear a lot of bash going back and forth on what is better so lets just put this into perspective.

RIPPLE IS NOT A CURRENCY. period. It is mainly used from my understanding for liquidity and the transfer of currency quickly and cheaply which will be very important for all your bitcoins, shitcoins, unicorncoins or whatever fiat fetish you are into since currently banks still control the 99% and until THEY fully accept cryptos the world as a whole will not. Until the day I can go to my bank and purchase a crypto currency all of this is worth nothing but speculation and a hype train. 

I cant see why people are trying to bash ripple as being worthless since it isn't a currency, but in my opinion you are investing in THE COMPANY not the COIN. Ripple offers a service to banks which seems much more valuable then what is currently being used and IMO it has the highest chances of entering this tiny crypto community and into the stock markets. 

"
"You will get more value from asking yourself: ""why did XRP pop?"" "
Maybe you guys didn't see it coming because you were too busy fighting a pointless war against banks. Most of the arguments used against Ripple were only politically biased hate speech. 
This is the kind of post I expect in /r/Bitcoin but not here.
It's time for Bitcoin community to unite and oppose the real enemies i.e. banksters. 
"Who cares. Good for ripple.

Ripple has a ceiling. They cannot be a main world currency, that would make the CEO of Ripple literally the most powerful man on the planet. Power corrupts, and corruption produces a lesser product.

I'm sure that ripple and private blockchains have a purpose in the market, but I don't see it as a global currency like bitcoin cash. A global currency would have to be uncontrolled because that is what benefits the market the most. The market will always tend to go toward what benefits itself the most.

edit: Sorry, I missed that part ""no blockchain"". Is that true?"
"Look, there's a hell of hype now surrounding Ripple & XRP, right now the market cap on XRP is more than every other crypto save BTC and do you know why?

Because it will probably get used more than every other crypto, and I would honestly guess it will get used more than BTC eventually too.

This space, let's be honest, is speculative as fuck. While I love it here and have made a lot of money and hope to continue to do so for quite some time, again if we're honest, this is a really small little world. It is mostly filled with geeks, nerds, tech heads, early adopters who now claim to be investment experts, a whole bunch of people talking shit and an astoundingly large number of complete fucking idiots who have no idea what the hell is going on. Yes the space has gotten bigger, yes it has attracted a bunch more people, and yes there are also the idealists, the visionaries, the genius revolutionaries, and so many incredible minds and awesome people.

I also love the idea that crypto will change the world, revolutionize the economy, bring peace in the middle east and vastly improve my vehicle situation...

But outside of this little world, is the real world. That's where the bankers live, the big institutions, where most people haven't even heard of this world and those who have, have only heard of bitcoin and ethereum and couldn't explain the difference between the two if their lives depended on it. 

Despite the claims, I don't think most cryptos are going to be adopted anywhere near as much as the hype suggests or most people are gambling on, and that's what most of this is, to be honest, speculative gambling. I highly doubt people are going to go to the store and scroll through a list of their BTC, BCH, Dash, Monero, or XVG wallets to see what they will use to quickly pay for their coffee and croissant that is easier and cheaper than handing over cash or swiping your paypass chipped card. Because if we're honest, its not easier. 

Sure many of these cryptos will grow, perhaps some will die, some will get adopted more, and this is the early days...

But XRP doesn't really give a fuck about that idealized, romanticised crypto-fuelled Utopia and has never pretended to. It is a private, centralized company, with massive institutional backing, solving a real-world problem and addressing a real-world need, in a more efficient way than is currently offered. 

XRP is kicking ass right now yes, because of hype. Yes, because of speculation. But mostly because it has real-world uses that are far far greater than this tiny little world. The thing about this little world is that the longer you spend in here, the more important you think it is.

Just my two cents worth... "
"What do we do?

I’m was fully expecting BCH or ETH to pass BTC, but I NEVER guessed XRP would be the one that may actually do it...."
"For being so educated on XRP, frankly you don't seem to either not be able to answer your own points but rather make them questions, or present falsities on some matters.

1) Ripple lab's XRP ledger is a blockchain, but each node takes the place of what miners do. So if XRP doesn't use a blockchain, I could easily say BTC doesn't because a ""trusted network"" is the one verifying transactions.

1.5) Those trusted nodes select which they trust, and transactions are sent across the shortest path of trusted nodes between one another. So it is like using a trusted individual to act as an intermediary to give funds to someone else, while allowing them to also hand it off to an individual they trust until it gets to an individual the person you are sending to trusts.

2) There is no mining, 100 billion coins is the maximum that will ever exist and currently over half is in an escrow contract meaning that it is frozen for so many months and 1 billion is released monthly...anything that isn't purchased by financial institutions is put back into a 54 month escrow contract. On top of that transaction fees aren't paid to anyone, they are burned into the ether making it a deflationary currency.

3) You are correct in that XRP isn't fully required...but in order to open an account on the XRP ledger you have to fund the minimum reserve which is inaccessible funds used solely for transactions. Nodes can use fee voting to raise or lower this reserve as prices increase making the XRP usable by the account for other purposes.

4) Yes it is somewhat centralized...but it also isn't to a degree as well. The only real centralization issue is when one party controls a majority of XRP...which is an issue with all currencies. Them working with banks to solve real financial problems isn't what makes it centralized. Right now Ripple labs is removing 1 of its nodes for every 2 third party nodes that come into existence in an attempt to not be subject to a 51% attack and has the goal of being more decentralized that bitcoin. Yes it is a goal on paper and may be a false promise so I can understand being bearish about those claims.

4-5) Also, posting a few words and raising concerns isn't explaining how those things are problems...it is showing your lack of information on those matters.

Overall, if you don't like XRP, think it is a scam coin, or just dislike the fact that Ripple Labs is a fintech company working with the banking industry....that is fine...but I personally am bullish on the coin used in a technology intended to free up the 27 trillion dollars locked up in nostro accounts, which would almost double the amount of narrow money available to use globally...because once you add liquidity to banking and ALL fiat currency has the ability to be liquid, every legitimate crypto is going to fair better as it fills in as a substitute for fiat...because right now what good is replacing fiat currency if most global wealth is just sitting around as it is and not moving? In my opinion disliking XRP and Ripple labs is short sighted because what they are doing is the first step in making cryptos actually have the ability to *replace* fiat.

Plus I enjoy having 5 second transaction times.

EDIT: Also, if you are coming over from the Ripple sub don't engage in brigading...not only is it hella childish but some of the concerns individuals are raising over XRP is valid...all we can do is try to inform individuals who are lacking in information...the goal for all of us should be to legitimize cryptocurrencies as what they were intended for: a currency. That can't happen though if the different communities are too busy fighting with one another to address their preferred currencies own flaws in order to push for innovations. But that also means we should listen to others concerns and engage in rational conversation that isn't muddied by our own personal opinions and emotions."

Ripple isn't about being peer-to-peer money, moreso directed at the forex market, by being an intermediary token between exchanging of different currencies. In terms of utility and actual real world usage, in a way it deserves to be the #1 spot FOR THE SHORT TERM. But in the end, the #1 spot will be to whichever currency wins the peer-to-peer currency race (which is BCH's goal)"

"**Ripple Directs Bitstamp to Freeze Funds of Former Co-Founder Jed McCaleb**

McCaleb and Ripple signed a contract in the earlier days of Ripple that  basically stated that McCaleb was only allowed to sell or trade weekly batches of XRP worth at most US$10,000. 

According to Ripple, however, McCaleb tried to trade 96 million XRP worth around US$1 million in a single batch, which they claim broke the agreement. Ripple instantly demanded Bitstamp reverse the funds and return all 96,342,361.6 XRP to McCaleb.

All that is required for Ripple to freeze user funds is to notify them of suspicious or unusual activity in their accounts and to simply ask the gateways to freeze or even reverse the funds. Speculations arise among bitcoin enthusiasts whether Ripple can still call themselves a “decentralized payment network.”"
Dude, there are a lot of people that don't give a shit about any of that. They just want to transfer money. If it works, then that's good enough for them. And that's fine. Currency competition is good. 
"XRP is a digital currency that uses cryptographic proofs to verify transactions. That's enough to call it a cryptocurrency for me. If you're looking for an objective set of rules against which to make sense of the world, it doesn't work that way. The expectation you appear to have that cryptocurrencies *need* to use blockchains, or *need* to be a specific kind of decentralised... this only represents your own ideological baggage about the way things *should* be. People will make choices based on what is useful to them; expecting them to adhere to the same imaginary objective set of rules as you is a fool's errand."
"Would you idiots quit acting like every single project that isn't you is attacking you. The world doesn't revolve around your shitty emotions. 

Ripple serves a completely different purpose than crypto. Why waste your time with it if it isn't actual crypto?

This shit has made me a lot of money. I also own some Bitcoin, some Bitcoin cash, some Litecoin, some Ethereum, etc etc. 

Quit taking other projects success like a literal cock in the ass "
Makes me sick to my stomach. We have a perfectly good solution in BCH and nobody seems to notice or care. XRP goes against the very reasons I got interested in crypto. Talk about irrational markets. 
They own over 60% of the supply that they sell each month for a profit..... WTF IS THIS SHIT

I honestly wish we lived in a perfect world where everyone could become instantly technologically literate but the reality is that the masses will never be able to be their own bank for larges amount of money without having those constantly stolen, hacked or deleted by mistake. Think honestly about most people around you,  in your family, people at work etc. Do you honestly believe that they are ready to manage a private key that contains all their life savings? 

Cryptocurrency will still revolutionizes finances and thrustless ledger keeping with tons of fantastic projects so I am still extremely optimistic. Let the Bankers bank, they are not going anywhere no matter how much people wish they just magically disappear."

Is there a wallet for individuals? How to get a ripple address without using an exchange?
I don't have a fundamental problem with Ripple except for the fact that it only manages to do 1M tx/day on average. Even if it's just trying to be a better PayPal, that isn't going to cut it.

Price doesn't matter.  Just the technology.  The technology exists.  There are a ton of shit coins out there.  People are throwing money in crypto like it's the dot com bubble of 2000.

I have a feeling any coin that threatens BTC is going to be excluded from the list of *actual* cryptocurrencies (XRP is one, btw.)
"Seriously, what is the point of warning everyone against a cryptocurrency just because it's not the way you like it to be? 

You might not like Ripple for whatever reason and it's fine, I'm not a big fan of it either. But crying over a coin because it surpasses your favorite coin in market cap is wrong and you don't seem to see the big picture. 

A cryptocurrency that has a real life impact and use is good for the cryptosphere. No one forces anyone to use it. If it is useful for the financial sector, that's great! It will make arguments against crypto more difficult for them if they use ripple themselves. 

I really don't understand these warnings against a crypto that is being adapted in real life. There is far worse bullshit in the Top 100 than Ripple. "

"AFAIK and if my memory serves, Ripplepay was created even (far?) before BTC.

BTC is literally killing the ""small"" users in having both a high price, a high fee and a high delay; it has progressively killed attemps to open crypto to the markets (Steam, Newegg, spaceshift...)

BCH has one (only) default: to be in concurrence with Bitcoin, BUT still having a relatively close name: so, is it an enemy, a friend, a replacement? Communication may be complicated.

Somewhere - I guess people are get bored of all this shit.

Regular users use a crypto to send 50 or 100$.

They don't give a shit about premine or 51% attack or LN or maternodes or EDA or whatever geek technology.

They don't care about security/risks, or just as much as you use a bank note, is it a good one, a copy? We normally should NOT have to care.

In short, I think saying ""this Ripple shit is ridiculous"" is at the same level of /r/bitcoin saying ""bcash is shitcoin"".

Thank you to stay awake, learn from success and mistakes, and to pull UP, not push down."
Ripple is just a noob trap. The market cap is not real and it wont be listed on coinbase. It's not a threat.
What's funny is every aspect of this currency (Ripple) that is unlike Bitcoin is every added reason why this coin will survive as a cyrptocurrencies digital currency for small transactions on a large scale. Meanwhile Bitcoin can't even function optimally as a large scale large transactions currency. Bitcoin is a failed experiment, like Yahoo. Meanwhile Ripple is focusing on a singular utilization, doing it optimally better than any other currency, and the centrality of control Ripple as a company holds over Ripple will only lead to more unified future developments and they will seek deals that benefit the corportation and currency as a whole. Meanwhile the Bitcoin developers are divided and all seeking to exploit the protocol for their singular benefit instead of seeking to make decisions that will benefit the currency. Everything Bitcoin was, Ripple isn't. We will be having the same conversation about Ethereum's fall to Cardano ADA coins next. Mark my words.
"If they become established in the market there is a strong risk of regulatory capture. It may not be possible for newcomers to enter that market.

Any currency exclusively controlled by one company carries this risk. This is one of the risks that cryptocurrencies were designed to avoid."
"When Jed will dump his XRPs you will care more about ""moral values"""
What problem does it solve?
Precisely. There's so much hate towards Ripple, but everyone seems to be missing the point. Ripple solves a problem, does so decently well, but we all forget that it isn't solving the same problem as other coins. It'll never be a trustless currency, so why is everyone so threatened?
"> I'm sure that ripple and private blockchains

You're sure?  I think you are confused.  A private blockchain  is a useless and ultimately stupid gimmick.

Who are the players competing with worth their period of work?  and if you remove pow, how does it differs from a database? 

This is the core problem of all these non mineable tokens. If they can be printed at will,  they will.  And consequently dumped."
"> Sorry, I missed that part ""no blockchain"". Is that true?

Yes, it's a network of trusted servers, so essentially a glorified MySQL database distributed to multiple servers.

Also, they can freeze your funds or revert transactions, pretty neat ""crypto""."
"> trash other crypto

It's not crypto though. See? Even you weren't aware of that, education is very much needed in this sphere."
Banks aren't the enemy. Coinbase is perfectly fine. Central banking will be destroyed whether Ripple reigns supreme in coinmrketcap.com listing or not. They might add USD as well
There are no Bitcoin communities. It is BCH vs Banks. 
we here
"Banks serve legitimate purposes in the market and will continue to do so until decentralized services do a lot more than what any single cryptocurrency does now.

No, the point of bitcoin is to become money...not just another payment network. Commercial banks do not hold a monopoly on money or the issuance of currency. They can be in fact, currency-agnostic.  Only governments and their central banks monopolize money and have the legitimized power to initiate force against peaceful people. 

The state is, and has always been the enemy of freedom and decentralization. Bitcoin is inherently anti-state, and its time that new bitcoiners realized or learned this. If banks are capable of harming us, it is only through the state.

This juvenile anti-banking zietgeist needs to die. Many of the functions of banks will be just as necessary in a world where bitcoin or another crypto becomes money, and fractional reserve mechanisms will become necessary in a free-banking and competitive money environment, in order to accommodate shocks and alleviate deflationary ills like price and wage stickiness.

"
The Bitcoin community is so deluded, they don't notice anything anymore.
Banks use ripple, not XRP to move assets around. XRP is the ultimate stupid investment. 
Good points here, Best to be reasonable than insecure...
"You can't be more decentralized, in fact, you can't be decentralized at all if every single gateway/node has to be ID'ed and pre-approved, and is subject to regulatory pressure. Further even putting that aside, the entire thing is run by a corporation (Ripple Labs). It might as well be Paypal for banks.

Get this straight... Ripple Labs is not in the crypto currency business, and XRP by extension.

Sure, but if it's a financial instrument (more efficient SWIFT if you will) what in the hell is it doing on CoinMarketCap instead of a stock exchange?
No immutability at least
"> but in my opinion you are investing in THE COMPANY not the COIN

Exactly, so it should be on stock exchange, NOT CoinMarketCap. And that makes XRP a security and therefore **illegal** at least in the US. So don't be surprised when they get busted one day and all the XRP goes poof!"
uh where did you see this?
Also, ripple is proof of stake right?  No miners.  That could work if the coins were distributed with a faucet like with RaiBlocks, but since ripple has 60%, the 100% can decide what transactions are valid.  Right?
"> Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin. 

Lost me there pal"
I like your comment, but it's still hindsight. When BCH goes up, we say the market now considers BCH is the real bitcoin with cheaper transaction fees, etc., and when Monero is up, we say anonymity is the future, yada yada yada...
Do you have a source on that?

Idiots like to call other people idiots.
"Your missing the point as well as many others. The bickering amongst the btc and bch communities is childish and caused a great divide over nothing. At the same time btc has proven useless because it requires second coin, ltc and it’s fees are through the roof. So attention has been removed from the technology and focused on too much Jerry Springer crap. Meanwhile XRP has kept their heads down and focused on a solution that banks want and is attempting to offer a product that banks can use to lower fees in their business model as well as other features.

So if btc or bch would like to gain back the steam they had maybe they should spend less time arguing amongst them selves, spouting negative marketing and message board fodder and instead focus on providing a usuable product to the consumer or businesses? That would be: a product that is faster and easier to use than PayPal or Venmo, accepted everywhere like visa, and has lower fees than traditional banking options or credit.

Just sayin’ the lack of interest is largely driven by the misaligned focus of the communities responsible for development."
"> XRP goes against the very reasons I got interested in crypto

It's not a crypto"
"It's not irrational.  It is justified.

You have a BTC vs BTH dispute. This is considered instability. Big business doesn't like that. They don't like fork threats and shitty stuff like that.

Ripple provides assurances. Yes it is centralized. Yes it is pre-mined. But the big Asian business doesn't care about that. They care about making money. 
"
"Ripple isn’t about undermining crypto

It’s about improving the current stents before it’s removed

You aren’t going to get everyone switching straight away, it’s fantasy.

The banks are not going away any time soon so ripple targets it so you have a ledger that can’t be riddled with and when asked for will provide full transparency.

It will improve remittance payment making people’s lives so much better.

There are different coins for different roles, the conspiracy theories against anything that isn’t bitcoin or bitcoin cash doing well is pathetic"
Not irrational. They just don't know or care about the problems with centralised currency and are happy to make money in the system.
wwwwwaahhhhhhh....but but but BCH
hey, at least it doesnt utilize POW system.therefore it can be used far into the future. how long do you think BTC/BCH has before all the electricity and heat will become a problem?
so what? I can make my own coin, mine millions of them myself and set the price at $1000 each if I have central bank notes to do it with. It has no utility, so its clearly a pump.

They recently locked up those coins to be released at timed intervals and set amounts so basically they have stabilized their currency and your post is straight up FUD.

Wrong! It won’t affect price at all. Don’t talk out yer arse!
Right, why is it on CoinMarketCap then instead of a stock exchange, it isn't a cryptocurrency, it's a protocol with some internal accounting and therefore should be removed from CMC. 
Escrow
"Repeating from other thread. 

I'd buy Ripple Labs ICO Tokens (if they existed) due to Ripple's success with consulting with the large banks and offering lower cost money transfer solutions. These almost NEVER use XRP.

XRP is like a demo product to show the banks, but the banks want their own private version and nothing to do with XRP traded on the markets.

Sorry if this is a dumb question but what are nostro accounts?
"Couple of questions if you will.

Instead of using nostro accounts and basically trade IOU's between banks the video (I watched in the comment below) says you can now use xrp which is an actual asset with value. Who decides what value it has? Say ripple is worth 2usd right now and you send 1 million xrp to me.

Who says those 1mil xrp are worth 2 million dollars?

Did you buy em for 2 million usd?

Can I sell them for 2 million dollars?

What happens if the price fluctuates even 1% in the time of sending?

Do I now eat the 1% loss relative to the usd value?

This seems like just as risky as using IOU's with risk of a default. Am I missing something?"
Lmao it’s the TRUTH. No one gives a shit about the morals of crypto currency when they’re making thousands of dollars. Everyone knows it. You know it, I know it. Sorry for speaking the truth.

Bitcoin has like 1000x of the fees that you pay with PayPal. It's like 9999x slower. On top of it is public while a PayPal transaction is anonym to the outside. How is Bitcoin not dangerous? I mean it's literally a coin without a function other than storing value. How is it possible that this coin is still valued that high and why is Ethereum (one currency that has a lot of functions) not overtaking Bitcoin already?
How is that any different than new investors buying BTC? Answer it isn’t!
It's described pretty well in the OP.
"What? All I want is to have a resource where I can learn about the factual pitfalls of Ripple and being able to educate others who are interested so they do not invest their money blindly into something they might not want to if they knew how it works.

Just trying to explain bitcoin to people is hard enough, you can lose people in a hurry. Average guy looking to take part of his portfolio to the crypto casino is going to want to hedge, maybe try to get in on whatever is hot, isn't doing much research. If nothing else the recent success suggests it bears closer scrutiny than a lot of people have given it, myself included. "
No, Ripple was NOT created before BTC.
"Thank you. 

People haven't yet realized there is no single ""real"" cryptocurrency. All of the crypto will co-exists and the price between them will be the ""mindshare"" controlled by each crypto. The fact that Ripple is compliant with regulatory requirements is a positive aspect because it increases usability of say crytocurrency.

I don't think they care about getting on coinbase, the end game is bank usage. It's a tool to transfer currency quickly around the world with almost no fees. Comparing apples and oranges.
That's very much possible, however having a video or article for noobs explaining what Ripple is and that it's not a cryptocurrency would be good.

> McCaleb and Ripple signed a contract in the earlier days of Ripple that  basically stated that McCaleb was only allowed to sell or trade weekly batches of XRP worth at most US$10,000. According to Ripple, however, McCaleb tried to trade 96 million XRP worth around US$1 million in a single batch, which they claim broke the agreement. Ripple instantly demanded Bitstamp reverse the funds and return all 96,342,361.6 XRP to McCaleb.

> All that is required for Ripple to freeze user funds is to notify them of suspicious or unusual activity in their accounts and to simply ask the gateways to freeze or even reverse the funds. Speculations arise among bitcoin enthusiasts whether Ripple can still call themselves a “decentralized payment network.”"

It sure has and it has pumped liked this in the past too.

Now you know how the btc-fags felt when BCH boomed 
Sure, but I do not think the adoption will just magically come without informing people of the real issues, advantages and disadvantages of the many coins that exist.
BCH fanboys are truly delusional. To say that Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin is like saying Gold is a Dollar. They are two different assets.
I mean this shit is making Tether look like a failure.
"> XRP is kicking ass right now yes, because of hype. Yes, because of speculation.

Yes, its called a speculative bubble. Welcome to crypto, one per week nowadays. There are always plenty of games to play in the crypto casino...

"The amount of people pouring into the crypto space is very uninformed about the tech, they're mostly just here to 'get rich quick' and doubt they care if it's centralized or not. It's a shame too, because really good tech is getting ignored for pump and dump coins that don't do anything at all; it's really really looking a lot like the 2000 dot com bubble. I suspect sometime in 2018 may be the start of another long term bear market for all cryptos."
It will be short lived, just take a look at a market dominance chart, ripple has come up a couple times, seems to shrink back after a bit though.
"People forget that Ripple actually exceeded Bitcoin in market cap once back in 2013. The market cap metric is completely bogus for something like XRP where Ripple Labs holds a gigantic premine. For example, I could premine a trillion ForkiusCoins, sell one on Yobit to a friend for $1, and boom, instant trillion-dollar market cap. 

We know Ripple is not at all comparable and doesn't have the resistance to attack that most other cryptocurrencies do. It was Ryan Fugger's 2003 idea that Ripple Labs (then called OpenCoin) revived and tacked a totally superfluous coin onto in a crass effort to raise capital by riding the altcoin wave, then marketed the heck out of it to big financial institutions and governments who were clueless about this stuff. It's a boondoggle that will go nowhere except maybe making a more efficient SWIFT, but I doubt even that as they haven't solved the decentralized trust issue that Bitcoin solved. 

We can keep building the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem without worrying about the nominal market cap of massive premines or whatever the pump of the week is. The best coin will win. Let's make BCH the best!"
What do we do?  We hedge our bets, duh.
"> What do we do?

Use sound money. Ripple ain't one"
Absolutely nothing. Continue supporting Bitcoin Cash :) 
">What do we do?

Be smart, improve BCH. That's the only reasonable thing to do. Fighting against other cryptos because you don't like them would be... less smart.

Can the amount of XRP be increased? Like central banks do. I could not find much regarding this topic online and wonder if its technically possible. Hope someone can give me an answer or share some link where this is mentioned. Cheers
I posted this on the ripple subreddit but didn't get a reply - how does it get away with ~5-second block times? 
"There is absolutely nothing about Ripple making it decentralised. Every single user has at least 1 middle man, someone that has to be regulated and ""trusted"" and as soon as you do something the banks or government doesn't like, you're locked out of your own money.

Nodes can be bought out and over years and decades banks will own them all... they will at least have the majority.

It works the same way Lightning works... both are centralised systems, and therefore garbage and will do absolutely nothing to better the world. Fools."
"We don't want some banker controlled ""crypto"" to ""replace fiat,"" we want to actually replace government fiat and overthrow the old banking structure"
Umm, yeah, it definitely matters. Money talks. Ideology is one thing, but money is what spurs businesses to action.
Excellent injection of sanity.
Bitcoin used to have cards you could swipe in stores to instantly finish the transaction, just saying. 
Couldn't have said it better! 
You've made 100  posts on this thread as long as we're counting. Keep gripping onto your unsustainable unscaleable crypto and calling everyone a shill lol
"And you are shilling about BCH. Shilling is fine as long as it is argued and reasoned, true and opennto debate.

Your shill finger pointing does not bring any value to the debate and learning of the community. "
"I think a lot of what you said, which I liked in that it was very blunt, can bring most people down to earth; Although lets not forget what is still happening. You have to remember, Bitcoin is solving issues already in other countries, people are saving their money while their economy collapses - as well in Asia they are already preparing for digital currency. Also, tell someone from 2013 that the price of bitcoin is $14,000 - I am sure they will think the governments across the world were collapsing and that bitcoin was for sure taking over. 

Ripple might as well keep growing - but really it's more like a crypto-coin-stock than what true cryptocoins are. It has it's place, which is great, I for sure own some in my portfolio. But because of it's rise, it does not all of sudden reveal how insignificant, fantasy, geek like the rest of crypto is. We have NO idea what the whales are trying to stir up. The coins don't just follow the least path of resistance; meaning crypto is VERY, VERY manipulated. Just wait a few months and maybe things will seem more clear than what these past few weeks have shown us."
"i reckon BTC has taken far too long to solve it's fundamental problems and deliver on the promise that was the hype a couple years back with micro transactions, fully distributed nodes, easy cross border transfer, low fees and the saviour for the unbanked... which one of those has been delivered as yet?

i do think they are working to sort these issues out but they could end up getting wiped out due to painfully slow progress"
"What real world use? A few hundred bank branches in Japan? vs what? Millions of people using BTC/ETH/BCH/LTC to do monetary transactions + the world changing Smart Contract disruption tech? 

Also OP forgot to mention that it seems few people understand that Ripple the inter-bank network running on top of specific Core Banking platforms, has almost nothing to do with XRP.  XRP is a rare edge case usage.

But let's put that aside... Ripple is going to accomplish what exactly? 30-60% cost savings for banks vs using SWIFT and save banking customers days in international wires? Woopee... Pretty much every crypto can do that. Fuck, DOGE can do that, with even lower fees and it's a freggin meme coin. Only difference is Doge is not going to get integrated into core banking software platforms.

Banks are going to be able to save 30-60% in fees, whilst crypto can bypass banks and (excluding Bitcoin) can save 99%+ of the fees. Guess who's going to win out?

Oh and did I mention that all the margin profits that Ripple Labs will get from banks for implementing their product goes 100% to Ripple Labs and company and exactly 0% to XRP hodlers? Yep.

We are drowning in dumb money at this point. Pigs are going to get slaughtered eventually. Invest accordingly."
  u/hodor7777 how do I xrp tip this person?
Asia isn’t dumping, they believe in the coin and think it’s the next bitcoin so they’re hodling like their life depends on it. It’s the Americans who are doing the dumping.
I can't believe I'm in r/btc when reading this comment with so many upvotes. Is this r/cryptocurrency? XRP is and always has been THE centralized shitcoin. This is the yearly pump and dump, get rich quick scheme. Nothing else. Where did all the people with vision go? 
This needs way more visibility. Excellent comment.
"You bring up a good point that most people are clueless about all these coins, but then you seem to conflate the idea that crypto is a ""tiny little world"" (few people understand it yet) with the idea that its applications are tiny. The applications of Bitcoin Cash as global money are far, far, *far* broader than Ripple. And the fact that few people get the difference yet means gigantic upside potential for BCH or whichever cryptocurrency wins."
If you want to know what is going on with any coin that is getting a lot of attention like XRP use google. If you want some background information use Wikipedia. My two cents worth.  10 bits u/tippr 
"I don't understand how it is not controlled by banks when it targets banks and they only sell to financial institutions (what is not sold is put back to the scrow contract).

Moreover it is potentially inflationary despite the argument presented. If demand exceeds the 1 billion released every month, then it will be inflationary. And once all 100 billion are released it will be inflationary too. 

If one entity can block the funds of an individual... That's a considerable concern. 
But what I can't still understand is what is xrp useful for any end user."
Well said!
"> Look up what their escrow contract is and does before pulling out definitions of words please

Why do I have to look up what it does? It sounds like you're trying to make the concept complicated so people can't argue well against it. Let's keep things simple, shall we? :)

I repeat: the DICTIONARY definition of escrow is something held so two parties can complete a transaction https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/escrow

If Ripple Labs is one party who is the other? If you can't specify who the other party is why use the word in that way? 

>As to your other arguments, it is no different than mining pools hoarding Bitcoin and selling it later at a profit

Umm, yes, its VERY different. Mining pools compete openly in a free market for a supply that NONE of them controlled initially. 

>That said, your concerns are valid in a sense...

Thank you for admitting this.

>it is easy to mistrust something, especially when that something is dealing with another person/group/thing you already distrust.

I don't trust nor distrust Ripple Labs. I'm looking at the entire situation objectively. If I meet you on the street, and I don't know you, and you ask me to hand you all the money in my wallet it seems like you're saying I'm at fault for ""distrusting"" that you would give it back. My point is, why should we start things off with  you getting all my money in the first place? Trust has nothing to do with it. There is no point putting you in such a controlling position, is there? Sure you might see the point since you're in control, but what if we switched things around?

>it is quite easy to be cynical about just about everything if that is the kind of life you want to live

See above."
Your statement would have made more sense a year ago.

So xrp is worth more than the company paypal? Does it have a way to generate profit or get more users than paypal?
What are the real world uses of ripple? What institutions are currently using it?
u speak alot of sense
"Let's say Ripple Labs releases a new client that adds another 100M Ripple to circulation.

How does that create a ""fork"" if there's no ""chain?""

As I understand it, if that happens, then it happens.

If you hold Ripple and don't have a clear answer to the above question then I'd have to label you a fool (no offense personally).

> not gonna pretend to know for sure but that is a completely valid concern.

this from the guy that started his post

> For being so educated on XRP, frankly you don't seem to either not be able to answer your own points but rather make them questions, or present falsities on some matters.

uh huh"
"Who gets to issue the currency?

What happens to all fees?

Who defines the protocol?

Who bankrolled the entire process?

Can ripple exist without ripple.com? What can they do if they become a bad actor?

Bitcoin is a trustLESS decentralized system.

This is not trustless. It requires trust. You get to pick 'who you trust', but let's be honest...it's more automated than intentional.  We already have that system in place. "

"> Yes it is somewhat centralized

Haha.  Um.  You mean the most centralized crypto currency out there with a ""public"" token?  Ripple Labs runs all consensus."
"Superb response.
Was aware of the 5 trillion per day in x-border settlements...

And this, coupled with the non-banking use case can lead to an xrp price of around $5.60 -- see post xrp's Drake equation.

Was not aware of the nostro acccounts and that xrp could free up 21 trillion of fiat ccy that is locked up.

That surely benefits everyone... as fiat is debt issued and we are all paying for this locked up debt.

The additional 21 tr can give xrp a value of $10 without speculation."

Ripple Labs found a great way to make shitload of money
This! people are buying into xrp because they think all banks will / are using it. They aren't they are using Ripple network 
How is XRP gonna keep gaining in value If ripple doesnt need it to function?
This is the biggest, simplest red flag.
"Exactly. It's like a train into a Wonderland, like a coast facing tsunami. It ""explodes"" first"
This is exactly right. This is what these haters are missing. Ripples focus is not peer to peer or decentralization. Their focus is a network to provide banks easier and more efficient means to cut cost when it comes to moving money. What a novel idea, go to an archaic industry and over a better platform?!?! To be honest, Bitcoin has t done this and the jury is still out of BCH has. I believe we’ve moved toward a period where utility or perceived utility is what markets are looking for.
When you put it like that it just sounds like USDT for banks
Yea, it can be an intermediary all it wants but it doesn't change the fact that xrp should have nil value.
1 billion worth of coins in their pocket without doing a single things. Tether sure look like nothing compared to that.
No, it's my opinion.  Maybe I'm wrong.
"> XRP cannot be frozen by Ripple. Period

False. Ripple, the corporation, can lock any account at will. You are mistaken.

You are confusing decentralization with token distribution.

">For being so educated on XRP, frankly you don't seem to either not be able to answer your own points 

I see that you have a lot of upvotes, but [I literally just asked you the most fundamental question (what prevents Ripple Labs from inflating the currency) and you had no answer whatsoever.](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7mykhw/okay_this_ripple_shit_is_ridiculous_we_need_to/dry875r)

**RED FLAG**"
"You made no mention over Ripple Labs ability to freeze funds. That makes them a bank, not a decentralized cryptocurrency developer team.

You made no mention about this: ""It also requires verified user identification in order to use the network""  
Is it true?

Plus, having to pay to open an account in the network? Why? That will obviously push people into reusing the same account, severely undermining privacy."
"Where is the best place to find a description of the benefits and problems with ripple?

who decides if a node is trusted?

Honestly I would not trust many of the banks around the world; not sure I would trust any italian bank or japanese bank ( I understand the japanese all store there cash in strong boxes under the bed)"
Excellent analysis. Thank you.

">  Ripple lab's XRP ledger is a blockchain

No. call it a distributed ledger if you want, but a blockchain that claims to be trustworthy without having access to some of its earlier blocks is by definition not a blockchain. The fact that all the consensus nodes are controlled by one entity and that nobody else can join in the fun is also a strong hint.

It's not a blockchain, it's barely a cryptocurrency, it's a centrally controlled database that borrowed just enough of the blockchain concepts to ride on its buzz without doing any of the actual work.

That doesn't mean it's a bad product. Paypal, Venmo and all those guys are all doing terrific fintech things, and I'm sure some of the many Ripple announcements will translate into visible products someday too. But folks should spend a little time understanding what it is they're buying when they decide XRP is their next big bet.

Great answer. What are your thoughts on the token velocity problem as it relates to XRP?(if it does at all) - https://www.coindesk.com/blockchain-token-velocity-problem/
">To your first point: No they can't give themselves any amount they want because the total supply was pre-mined...no more than 100 billion will ever exist.

Based on what exactly? With a consensus blockchain the answer is ""consensus"" - one would have to convince a supermajority of the network to go against its financial incentives.

If Ripple lacks this consensus mechanism, then what prevents Ripple labs from introducing a software change that permits more coins to be issued?"
"> coin used in a technology intended to free up the 27 trillion dollars locked up in nostro accounts

"What reason do banks have to hold XRP? Can you walk us through that?

From my understanding, the idea is to replace USD as an intermediary asset in FX exchanges, and to do that, XRP would need to be both stable and liquid.

With full understanding of the XRP selling points and the technology behind it. How is value generated back to the token holders by the banks utilizing this system? Do the banks have to buy the tokens in order to complete these financial transactions and does that some how allow token holders to sell them to the banks at the market rate...?

"> but is it probable?

That's kind of why I wanted to get those numbers out of you. But let's talk probable: Worldwide growth of bandwidth availability will continue along with worldwide decrease in bandwidth cost. That's HIGHLY probable.

But will BCH get to Visa-level transaction traffic (2,000 txs per second) before bandwidth can catch up? Processing that level of traffic will require 300mb blocks, or 16 terabytes per year of data added to the Blockchain. How much bandwidth does the average developed area of the world need to have in your eyes to handle this in a decentralized manner? Or are you of the opinion that all or most users should be running a full node?"
I wouldn't speak so soon.  Personally my only real concern about LN is onboarding difficulties, which is probably only an issue with Core, and whether or not the routing mechanism will be able to perform under real life circumstances (and it may).   If there's a good use case on BCH, it'll definitely be explored.
Well, as far as I know it exists and you can run it so calling it vaporware is not appropriate.
Thanks
Sorry, English is not my first language...
I do as well. I made an avatar in Face Your Manga like a gazillion years ago, and I've never changed it.
This is not true at all. Segwit makes it easier to adopt but it is not needed. It just becomes more difficult to implement
it takes the years off, she's 47 according to my research.
"You make a good point right there. 

They got away by using plenty of manipulation, lies and propaganda in r/Bitcoin. I am just mentioning how she has 1 extra excuse to get away. I am not accusing her of being a SJW or getting away. 

"
It's okay, the downvotes show people don't like the truth. It's okay, because a lot of people don't like the harsh truth. Some also may felt offended by my comment, but it's okay. 
"I'm not saying Stark is a SJW, I am just mentioning how she could get away with this. There has been a rise in SJWs and inequality against men, but we don't assume all women are SJWs. 

If we do that, then we're no different then the Feminists. Many feminists have been hating on men, but that doesn't mean men should do the same, hate all females. 

Feminism = Empowerment and Entitlement for females only. It wasn't about equality.
Equality = Equal rights for male, female and all other genders."
"I could believe the hookers version also. That would also work well with Mr Catholic Luke Jr with 6 kids and wife. 

All money is political so I would counter they are very interested in Bitcoin. CIA has regularly counterfeited many other countries currencies btw. 
"
Wow.  And that got merged somewhere else?  Love how simple this implementation is.
As a 13 year old
Possible, yes, but is it probable? That is the real question, and should bitcoin cash be in a situation where it has the option to use sidechains so it doesn't end up in the same situation where bitcoin is now, which is an unusable system.
I just think that you are too optimistic about the people that develop lightning. My point is that they need to capitalise the investment, and the way you describe it seems a lot like are giving free money to other companies! (I have few knowledge in lightning development...my argument is more related to the investors money)
LOL brilliant!
[deleted]
This is true. And we're dealing with currency, so it's a lot more straightforward mathematically than a website or game and there doesn't need to be a beautiful UI/story and shitty hacks everywhere for the sake of hardware. It just needs to work well according to the way it was already designed.. so people making the equivalency of it being like DN which was terrible are not making a fair comparison.
Weird, pointing out the truth usually gets up votes in this subreddit. 
stop that that's rasist
"Being a male is no impediment. You can just 'transition', or come out as gay, and suddenly absolutely any form of criticism becomes 'harassment'.

That being said, I haven't seen any evidence that Stark is a SJW. Let's not assume that people will play the victim card simply because it's available to them."
"CIA?  They're worried about political nonsense.

I'm sure the bankers have their own intelligence service.  They hired a couple of hookers (or some young men) and have all sorts of video on Back.

When you watch his tabs video, he keeps looking to the camera with a look of guilt, of shame.  He not only looks like he doesn't believe his own propaganda, he's worried no one will believe it and the photos/video will get released.

Now, there's tin foil hat for you ;-)

Probably isn't that stark.  Just a lot of money, sing his praises, encourage him to work on LN, stroke the ego.  The more and more I read about core and blockstream I see banker useful idiots."
Its the truth you have a problem with, not the messenger 
What could you possibly have to say here?
Nice shill. /u/adam3us will want to hire you.
Because blockchains are very inefficient for large scale adoption. There will come a time when bitcoin cash will also need to use sidechains because the block will be just too big.
I frequented the strip bar a lot.

**T**he..
"I think that's a fair point. What I think is inexcusable is holding up a block side increase with the justification that ""second layer is just around the corner"". It's passing the buck, and it turned out exactly how many of us expected (no second layer, tiny segwit adoption, and nearly unusable fees / tx times). I hope LN works out, but my current guess is that it'll also be a flop on release because it'll be too hard to integrate and no one will support it"
Lightning is in DEVELOPMENT HELL!
"What to you defines ""too big"" as a block? I don't mean what size is too big, I mean what makes a too-big block excessively large? What makes it big to the point of being bad?"
That's not true: http://blog.vermorel.com/journal/2017/12/17/terabyte-blocks-for-bitcoin-cash.html
Segwit makes it easier because it fixes the transaction malleability problem which is a needed fix for lightning. I believe bitcoin cash is working on another solution for that though.
"We could argue about the definition of ""vaporware"", of which there are a few (never available to buy, never available to use, not manufactured).  In any case, they have it 90%+ written and working on testnet, as well as having been used on mainnet:

https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3-2yI_q5P0

http://bitcoinist.com/lightning-network-mainnet-beta-soon/

Hence it can be used now, albeit with enormous overhead (IMHO the real issue).   I'm no fan of Core or ""let's only scale via LN"" proponent, but the technology does exist in written form, and could be a nice feature for BCH or whatever else."
"Yeah. It's a Divide and Conquer. Be it Donald Trump or Hilary Clinton the US government will still be terrible in many ways. You'll find a person that is a liberal and say ""You must support LGBT people!"" or a conservative saying ""LGBT is not good, God will punish them for their sins."". It's better to take the middle ground and say ""It's none of your business whether a person is LGBT or not""

Liberal politics also go too extreme (same for conservative but it liberal politics going extreme won't either show up in news or be shown in different wordings) "
News to me, link?
I was just giving an example how she could get away with it, considering the fact that Bitcoin Core has made so much excuses, she may have one that works well. It sounds (my comment) sexist, but I'm just giving an example how she could get away. I wasn't accusing her of getting away at all, I was just mentioning how she could get away. People felt offended, so they downvoted me, but I'm fine with it. 
"> the main state works for (or answers to) the deep state (the bankers).

Absolutely. 

I haven't had time yet to read the details but I have seen talk of $21T missing / unaccounted for over last 10 something years. Modern central bank fiat was invented to enable war making and given the number of wars lately it is likely (if that money is really missing) it was put into advanced weapons and intelligence related work. 

If cryptocurrencies ever manage to penetrate the real economy at even a marginal degree it would be catastrophic for the military industrial complex and nation state military. That is a very big concern to western intelligence I am sure. 

Bitcoin as a **store of value** is really pretty benign because infinite fiat can be routed via PPT like operations to manage it ""value"" just like gold markets. Bitcoin as **uncensored money** is deadly to the nation state as official/manipulated prices can easily diverge from the real/black economy, anyone with a high enough IQ can see this difference very very easily. "
When splitting isn't even necessary, yes, it is.
Oh, I see that. 
Yeah, I'm expecting a TM fix to appear in the BCH chain tree if there's sufficient demand.  Low on chain fees would work nicely with LN if the groundwork is there (and not a mess like SW).
Honestly, I dont know. I am not shitting on bitcoin cash here. I want big blocks and sidechains. I want bitcoin and bitcoin cash to be just one bitcoin. 
I didn't say segwit was the best way, just expanding on the comment above.
">that Rube Goldberg piece of software.

Splitting a transaction in two parts is too complex for r/btc. "
What?
"Point taken.. The real takeaway here is that BCH needs Segwit or something like Segwit in order to use Lightning which was in response to Donmartini who said ""no problem using it on bitcoin cash"""
Transaction malleability was fixed in November for Bitcoin Cash. 
"> they have it 90%+ written

It's 10% that we told them can't be done that's the missing part though, and it'll never work past demoware without a working routing model."
"> Bitcoin as a store of value is really pretty benign because infinite fiat can be routed via PPT like operations to manage it ""value"" just like gold markets. Bitcoin as uncensored money is deadly to the nation state as official/manipulated prices can easily diverge from the real/black economy, anyone with a high enough IQ can see this difference very very easily.

Exactly.

Here is when they thought it was $9 trillion missing:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pnc7IXpC0

and another link at $21 trillion - most people can't fathom how much that is - its about $65,000 per American.

"What block size is too big for today's bandwidth, in your opinion? And how big will be too big for the bandwidth of 10 years from now? Or 20 or 30?

Also, when do you think is the earliest Bitcoin Cash growth would necessitate a too-big block size (assuming no sidechains)?"
[deleted]
because segregated witness is sop problematic for developers it will be easier to add to bch
No one is working on code for Bcash, just a couple of salty bitches who strip Core dev’s names out of their code and try to bolt it on their altcoin
Who's working on the code to make it work though? All the existing implementations are written to use Segwit.
"This link is the Lightning Labs CEO saying Segwit IS required for Lightning:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7l5x7n/spread_the_word_lightning_developer_elizabeth/drk3l4a/

> BCH doesn't have a malleability fix. Lightning as implemented needs one, such as segwit.

> Bitcoin activated segwit in August, and Lightning uses it. But not all exchanges/wallets/etc. support segwit yet. Anyone using Lightning would already be using segwit."
Yes and with the shitty devs that run bcash (any change they did they had to hard fork to fix) they won't be able to. 
The biggest problem is that opening a channel, before you're even able to send any money, is $30. None of the current implementations work on BCH afaik.
">I wouldn't speak so soon.

This is hilarious.

The definition of vaporware is something that's being marketed even though you can't use it yet, and your rejoinder is, ""I wouldn't speak so soon.""

You don't get it. If someone is pitching it, then either it's either here, now, and ready to use; else, it's vaporware."
"> a product, especially software, that is promoted or marketed while it is still in development and that may never be produced

The thing being shown around is demoware and couldn't possibly scale up past a demo sized use case.

It is by definition vaporware until it's something you can use IRL today and it'll do what it says on the tin."

I don't disagree with you about modern feminism (old school feminism I respected more though and some old school feminists are still around) but I don't really see the relevance here.
I agree.  But I think that CIA works for the deep state as much as for the main state.  Either way, the main state works for (or answers to) the deep state (the bankers).
Fixing non-critical bugs isn't necessary, but it's a good thing to do. 
Is it possible that, as our worldwide capacity for bandwidth grows at the rate it has been growing, block size will not be an issue?
I would define too-big as the point where is becomes difficult for bandwidth.
What sort of internet connection would be required to download and upload 1TB blocks every 10 minutes? Note: I am assuming all blocks are full which is wrong but let just say that is the case for 1 hour.
If that happens, welcome to a centralized bitcoin being run out of China. 
There are better ways to fix transaction malleability without using that Rube Goldberg piece of software.
No one, because original vision! Read the holy whitepaper! The holy trinity, Satoshi, Ver and Jihan! 
"Nealy all Bitcoin Core, as well as Lightning Network developers, are male.

bcash is a sepaewrte coin, if you weren't too stupid to understand that I'd tell you that segregated wintess is a horrible code choice and is a major reason legacy bitocin won't ever recover


LN can be added to bch faster than legacy bitcoin *because* bch doesn't ahve segregated witness!"
"Haha! You're actually 100% accurate with that she could get away with this by playing the woman card. She already is getting away with it considering Lightning Network should already be here. According to her estimate it should've had been ready prior to July 2016. Also, anything controversial will get you downvoted when you're among millennials. That means supporting anything conservative really, such as Christianity, traditional marriage, the military, etc. Just look at my threads about Andreas Antonopoulos where I criticized he's involving liberal politics into Bitcoin by publicly bashing Donald Trump and donating and encouraging others to donate to Lambda Legal, a liberal political organization supporting LGBT ""rights"" among other liberal politics. Those threads were severely moderated and bashed upon."
Can I pay with ZWB dollars?
Which will happen first LN for full self driving on a Tesla (3 months maybe, 6 months definitely... About a year agol
And who needs LN when you have dPoW!
You know it's running right now and you can go and use t right? And there's multiple examples of it running on the main net already?

Duke Nukem Forever of Crypto..
"**Development of Duke Nukem Forever**

The video game Duke Nukem Forever spent fifteen years in development, from 1996 to 2011. It is a first-person shooter for PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, developed by 3D Realms, Triptych Games, Gearbox Software and Piranha Games. It is a sequel to the 1996 game Duke Nukem 3D, as part of the long-running Duke Nukem video game series. Intended to be groundbreaking, Duke Nukem Forever has become infamous in the video games industry and was considered vaporware due to its severely protracted development schedule; the game had been in development under 3D Realms since 1996.

People complaining about LN not coming in faster deserve no respect whatsoever from me and shouldn't from anyone else who wants to see crypto currencies grow.  Why would anyone want something with such impact be rushed? Each time it gets delayed, it gets delayed with a reason and the technology gets better.  Also, what kind of individual you must be to demand something to be made faster when you are pretty much getting it for free?
"Talk about creating a delay so you can complain about it.

If segwit was not held up because it was ""unfairly cheap"" for users (Rogers words, oh the irony) we would have had it back then.

Your integrity is Zero."
Conspiracy theory - these people are agents, somehow compromised by intelligence agencies. Back was probably called into CIA like Gavin but never told anyone, he was disgruntled and jealous and egotistical person that would be perfect for them to utilize, promise him success and wealth, line up their favorite proxy VC firms for him, explain he needs to help them for national security because he is a patriot. Stark same kind of story, Harvard and Yale professors are favorite pawns of agencies, do it because we know better we are the elites and these ideas are dangerous. Any core developer with public identity could have been targeted for recruitment. Can't stop it so infiltration and slow it down, handicaps of 7 tps, bread discontent and factions, all signature strategies of intel operations to disrupt movements.

"I would actually want for LN to launch and deliver as advertised and be included in BCH as soon as possible. LN have potential to fulfill good use case of super cheap nano transactions which will stab Visa and Banksters right into heart.

This alone will undermine fractional-reserve system and I’m looking forward for that.

Of course most of this traffic will be KYC/AML -ed and regulated but that is not completely bad thing. BitCoin/Crypto is different thing for different people. It is important that cheap on chain transactions are preserved on BCH which will still have all good attributes for which we all fall in love with crypto. If government abuse its power on regulating and oversight it we can with just a click of a mouse get off Ln. And of course we will keep only pocket money there in the first place."

Oh my, just found out this reddit is wrote by evil  Roger. Better downvote it.
"Bitcoin Cash is dead, Ripple will be the new king, faster and cheaper and they run the nodes for you because users don't need to run nodes.

It's what r/btc has been saying all along but now you're all biased against Ripple because you're financially invested in Bitcoin Cash. "
"Nothing funnier than seeing high level clowns in a company get called out for their stupidity in a future based statement. And then proceed to fail at their own moronic predictions utterly. 

Get fucked idiot. God these people.."
"Hey roger, use k-y-jelly

Your ramblings sound more and more like a hurt butt.

Oh, and maybe double the salaries in all those independent devs that are working hard on copypasta "
This is not normal for competent development teams. Something would have to be wrong with either their estimation process, the underlying algorithm, or staffing to cause these kinds of delays.
"Yeah, while delays obviously aren't good, a delay of this magnitude is nothing special and happens to plenty of projects, both projects that turn out great and projects that turn out terrible.

It would be something else if she had claimed that it would be ready in a month, since that would have indicated that she thought the project was nearly done, percentage wise. A 6 month estimate means that she thought there was still a boat load of work to do, and that work took longer than expected / was more complicated than expected / whatever. Happens all the time, especially with projects like this that have many new bits and pieces that have never been implemented before (or that haven't even been invented yet..)"
We need moar women in tech.
If anything it's a jackpot for bitpay. Everyone can open a channel with bitpay and use it for payments to thousands of merchants worldwide. No other company has as many merchants already connected as bitpay.
CoinBase and BitPay will become most used big node-hubs in crypto space.
nerds, whaddaya expect?
I recently saw a clip of a real life interview and it immediately clicked why she uses a drawing.
Maybe she just likes the drawing? My Twitter pic is a drawing too.
Sheez you are so incoherent... ideas all over the place, slung together by nothing more than punctuation and paragraph returns. 
At least we have low fees and our second layer solution tipprbot. 
Everyone should read this great tweet storm by Jstolfi talking about how her analogy to LN as being teleportation is actually pretty accurate when considering the technical in-feasibility: https://twitter.com/JorgeStolfi/status/945698425902903297
"Seems like every week they put out an article how Lightning is “working perfectly” in simulations. 

Yep, and I’ve got some beautiful beachfront property in rural Kansas I’d like to sell ya."
"underpin = support from below.  
undermine = destroy from below. "
BarterDEX is here and now and can be used for atomic swaps with about 90 coins right now. 
Lightning is vaporware.
"Lightning Network ICO

Token: Bitcoin Core

Roadmap: Product release very soon
"
"That's normal in project management.

Started a project which was planned for three months.

Now one year in it. Another year planned lol"
While that is true, don't worry! It'll still be ready in less than 6 months! \*cough\*
More than 4 times wrong. 
And yet when it is ready and running you will have no problem using it on bitcoin cash.
she meant, Lightning Network ll be ready in less than 6 months after bitcoin has crashed..So they are well right on track.
"since the routing problem isn't now and may never be solved, LN is vaporware until it is.

but trying to delay normal upgrades like core did to legacy bitcoin is the harmful thing"
"It's being used on mainnet now.

"Hey /u/MemoryDealers I wonder if you remember Segwit being blocked for so long because it would prevent ASICBoost from being used covertly? 

Hmmm...I wonder why bcash doesn't have segwit. I guess a heavily vetted fix to transaction malleability isn't important if it means less profits for the mining cartel you're shilling for. You're such a slimy politician.

So what happens to your selling point for bcash if LN soon actually allows for fast, low fee transactions on bitcoin proper? Is it just gonna be ""muh Satoshi's original vision""?"
This is what politicians do. They create an evil scapegoat to shift all the blame onto while promising to led us back to a time when things were great. Who cares about false narratives or fallacies like false equivalences. The dude is running his campaign just like a slimy politician.  
BCH can't use it. Segwit is needed
A little harder than they thought. What does this say about its usage? 
"They were 4x wrong

24 months passed / 6 months ETA = 4x wrong"
Except maybe for the patents...
Bitcoin Cash has segwit? 
Then segwit took longer to activate and so on. Who cares, there is bitcoin cash now. But it doesn't look good that the big block community still is focused on bitcoin core. Bitcoin cash has to stand on its on merit and not be dependent on cores failure, that is a weak position to be in. Time to move on. 
Why would you use side chains?? 
I'll use it if there is a good use case. looks like crap to me mostly though.
It’s at a higher volume ?

"True on all parts except 3 things.

- Your banks charges you more for transactions then Bitcoin Cash, don't use Bitcoin BTC to make a comparison, we know who controls it (the bankers).
- Your banks use your funds to make themselves richer, and also use your money to fund wars and what not else, Bitcoin Cash does not do that.
- Your bank can block your account if it chooses to, all you have to do is try to go against the system. Bitcoin Cash does not do that.

You are very clearly thinking like a sheeple. Just where is your spirit and integrity? Oh I know, its rotting away in your bliss of ignorance."
Read the message in the Genesis block.
"Current banks have never been hacked (or doesn't really matter if it's hacked) because the money is insured. But that's because it's been around for decades now. 

In the beginning, no one would put money in the bank because it be could loss or stolen and that would fall on you. So it was better to stick it under the mattress. It was only after the FDIC was introduced that people began trusting the banks again."
"Well look like you love the banking system.

I am not sure why you interested in cryptocurrency then?"
">  And Ripple will have a good share of it.

Why wouldn't someone just get a job at Ripple Inc and develop an inside attack vector? Seems much easier to attack a centralized non crypto with some inside leverage than it would be to rob a bank..."
Totally misinterpreting what I said.
Are Gold or USD listed on cryptocurrency exchanges?
"Same can be said by Tether. BTC supporters claim BCH is centralized. We both like EOS, yet most ETH supporters also claim that it is a centralized coin being run by one company. etc. etc. etc.

Where do you draw the line? If a Cryptocurrency is traded on a cryptocurrency exchanges as crypto, IMHO it has its place on CoinMarketCap.

It is up to the investor to do his/her due diligence, like everything in this space."
Let's face it, most people here are just in for the money, and don't try to disagree because you know it's true. Many people don't actually care about how the tech works, but they made a massive profit with it so they're happy. This sub is full of shittalk about XRP now and you know why? Because most of them are just jelly that they missed out a good and easy profit. I've nothing against both coins, but a behaviour like this is nothing more that ridiculously childish.
"Raiblocks uses a decentralized vote to decide on what transaction to accept in case of a double spend. The weight of each node's vote is proportional to how many coins he represents (delegated proof of stake). 

People can choose a representative node to vote on their behalf (if they don't have a node online all the time) and there's no locking up of funds.

As such, there's no coordinator and transactions are instant. "
How could it be decentralized if there's no mining?  What incentive is there for people other than the company to  secure the ledger?  
I mean look there's nothing wrong with companies, they can do many things well.  But why pretend to be decentralized?  
"> Face it, crypto went mainstream.

Mainstream as a speculative asset. We are shooting for main currency of the whole planet here. We are not even close."
"You buy into a 100% rise in 24hours coin. I hope your ""luck"" is good."
Making ripple usable?  Apparently it is faster and way cheaper than bch.  I haven't used it though.
Cute.  The white paper.  Really?  How many times should I read it?  How about bip 39 how about bip 41?  They weren't in the white paper.  When will you Move On?  Ripple kickin' you ass bro!  It's way faster and FREE and not deflationary.  It actually stands a chance at the digital cash prize.  Oh.... regarding 'legacy' bitcoin (propaganda much) - yes, I see how it is exactly satoshi's vision.  Bitcoin cash to me is a bastardisation of satoshi's vision.  We all have our opinions, and I'm happy to go beyond the title of the white paper just like satoshi did himself.
"if your in crpyto thinking your some hero fighting the big bad banks.... your in it for the wrong reasons.

"> Good luck removing banksters, cuz that ain’t happening.

Maybe after a crisis will destroy all crypto except few that actually do something meaningful (like Bitcoin Cash or Monero) people will get smarter. Because they will have no choice."
"> yeah that'll happen, keep your head up your ass man

It will happen faster than you expect and faster than you can run.

Enjoy your ride."
"> This, how the fuck are so many positive comments about ripple massively upvoted here? Wtf has happened to this sub?

People who own ripple want other people to buy ripple so they can sell for a higher price."
"Invest in Ripple labs then. That is a great investment. XRP won’t be used by the banks/credit card cos. Some explicitly said so and so did Ripple execs. Furthermore, the ones that are merely speculation have no need to use XRP when they can just use the ripple protocol. Maybe if you actually investigated what you bought you would know. 

I don’t care about the forking. I own multiple cryptos including XRP, but I’m not a sheep like you that just wants things to get pumped. XRP is not good for crypto and decentralization. It’s protocol is a decent product, but there is literally zero need to use xrp when Ripple will just integrate their protocol. "
"> Hating an investment isn’t a path to successful investing.

What a strange and depressing statement. Kind of implies that you would invest in anything that was anticipated to make money. Where do you draw the line? I give a fuck what Bitcoiners thought, and think, because the *philosophy* behind Bitcoin, originally and now (although obscured by greed), was based on more than lining ones pockets."
"Hahaha good one... XRP will be used. Yeah no hope and speculation in that. LMAO

Are you 6 years old?"
The good thing is an open protocol is used with Ripple plus compliance and regulation. Transparency can be implemented by design so even you see what your bank or your president is doing with money. I claim this is a good thing. 
"Nobody cares about BCH. Your point is only valid when BCH gets the same adoption as Core.
"
"Actually I’m considered quite the innovator in my day job. 

As far as banks go, the R3 and Ethereum Alliance seem to agree with my premise that banks aren’t going away anytime soon. 

Sometimes when you spend life on the bleeding edge you begin to think it’s the norm. It isn’t. 

And if you think all these ICOs and the more than 1100 cryptocurrencies are planning on changing the world, well then you are the one blindly following faith in the wrong place. Most are pure cash grabs. "
"You do know that tether is *supposed* to be a USD-backed token at a ratio of 1:1, right?

If it deviates too far from that, something is very wrong."
It's the stuff your bank does that you don't see. That's what's troubling.
"Bank do have their place, and will probably continue. But to say your bank has never been hacked for $100's of millions implies that your bank never held that kind of money in the first place. Or it is a new bank. Every bank that existed in the US in 2008 was hacked for trillions of dollars. It was not a computer hack, but a social hack. See money supply:

https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/money-supply-m0

See that big spike that started in 2008 and continued into 2015? That was a 3 trillion dollar hack! For every dollar you held in your bank, your purchasing power was cut down to about 25 cents. That was by far the biggest hack ever to date.

Did your bank do this? No. But it was hacked. ;-)"
"Except XRP will be used. So there’s that. Hating an investment isn’t a path to successful investing. Analysis should be dispassionate and measured. Any other approach is pure hope and speculation. 

Who gives a fuck what bitcoiners thought in 2013?  It’s 2018 soon. Life changes. 

Maybe step back and fork again or something. "
"Do you think it'd be OK for them to list USD? Or Gold?

They should list coins that meet their definition of a cryptocurrency. If a coin doesn't meet the requirements, it shouldn't be listed.

Let's be clear: I'm not saying Ripple shouldn't be listed. But I get the idea that some people think they should somehow just list anything that claims to be a cryptocurrency."
No they should not censor actual cryptocurrencies. But Ripple isn't a cryptocurrency because it's run by 1 central entity. It is not decentralized in any way whatsoever. It doesn't even fit the definition of a crypto. It's like listing some stock from the stockmarket on coinmarketcap. Those are tradeable too, but they have centralized points of failure. Thus they are not cryptos.
Ripple isn't a coin. Why no USD?
That’s fair and I respect that perspective. I felt that way when I first heard of BTC years ago.  As an investor, I see opportunity on both sides. 
"My point is what makes him so virtuous to lead the charge for a crypto-currency supposedly designed ""for the people"" when clearly there is even less than the rule of law to govern his behavior?   Why should anyone support a cause that betters his financial position when he has no obligation to even act within any legal or moral framework?   Crypto-currency was supposed to protect us from people who said one thing and did another.  Support currencies that enforce this! "
"*Has higher market cap

And not a coin"
Well apparently the only way to get through to the surge of ignorant people throwing money blindly at counter-productive platforms, is big, bold, lettering. Because obviously, they don't read anything that isn't put infront of them in less than a paragraph. Otherwise ripple wouldn't have made it this far. 
Don't know, i guess so. XRP *was just like Tether*. And it has no use anymore as the Tether concept was abandoned long ago and the company changed direction completely.
"Thanks for that. Was not aware of the existence of such a ""Coordinator"" node. Do you know much about how RaiBlocks approaches this issue?"
"Decentralized ledgers.

Initial distribution was centralized (genesis addresses and chains had all the coins), but RaiBlocks at least was crafty in how they distributed coins."
I saw that it overtook Bitcoin Cash in market cap a few days ago and when it over took  Ethereum today I didn’t want to miss out on an opportunity to make  some mad gains to buy a Lambo next year. 
What’s your outlook on Tether?
I'd say USD is on #1 and it's not a cryptocurrency.
"Call a spade a spade.   The vast majority of posts on this sub are about other coins and subs, crying foul play or a denouncement of some sort.   Most subs, including all  mentioned, are plagued by greed, self interest, stupidity. fear and/or anger .   If you truly don’t expect this from bitcoin cash, you might be caught up in the same game you are hating on.   

Let’s see more posts about the technical roadmap and analysis, and fewer posts crying disbelief in another bitcoin sub censorship or links to the original white paper as proof core is evil and bch  should be crowned king and anointed with the holy grail of being right.

Such is life .  Human nature to group with others and fabricate irreconcilable differences.

"Yeah, Ripple seems much more like Paypal but with a public ledger and ""ripples"" instead of dollars because *hype*."
I knew about that. It means they still have sole access. Futures and options can be sold based on that. It's a good start, but does not really take away the risk as much.
This, how the fuck are so many positive comments about ripple massively upvoted here? Wtf has happened to this sub? ripple is, and always will be, a massive piece of shit. Ripple the company might be great, but XRP the token is worthless
from all the downvotes and your answer I think you all read my comment the wrong way around. I'm saying ripple has **no** chance against real open cryptos because a merchant accepting a ripple payment will still have the risk of not receiving the money he thinks that he just received (because for example the bank decided it was stolen money so they reverse the payment)

You are the one that needs to learn how to read and think, and go read that Bitcoin white paper. You stupid Core trolls."
"Yup, but this is the thought process of all my friends that just got into Crypto this month. They bought a bunch of Ripple because it was the cheapest on Bitstamp and all I heard from them today is how it’s going to moon to $100+ once Coinbase lists it. 

I tried explaining to them marketcap/circulating supply and they seem to not understand it. I’m pretty sure they are unaware of how Ripple/XRP works. I’m happy they are making some gains but I’m to the point of wanting to move to a new city and not having any friends. FML"
The problem with BCH os that it's playing a game of marketing, not innovation.  There's so much tit-for-tat that's going on and it comes down to who you believe. 
"This is how open source works.   The code is vibible to all and can be forked and used independently of the original purpose.   Miners and users can chooose to use anyone’s fork if they want, but without adoption of the masses it doesn’t amount to anything.

There always has to be owners of a project who control code changes, otherwise it would be chaos.   

There have been more than 2 contributors and it is “controlled” and “influenced” by more than 2.   "
"That's my question as well.  I think we have a problem with the way Bitcoin and its variants are managed.  There seem to be a select set of representatives that seem to promote or control these coins in some way.  In the case of BCH, you may have missed some blatant attempts at market manipulation.  This should be very hard to do if some 70 billion dollars of market cap was evenly distributed.  That's not a coin of the people - it's a coin being controlled for the financial benefit of the few. 

Charlie Lee, the ""good guy"" of crypto should have been a warning for everyone.  If he is able to dump out at an ATH, then what more a person like Roger Ver who argues that Coinbase's insider trading was not a crime.  Sure this might be technically true, but it's morally corrupt.  

The reason I got into crypto was for giving people an equal standing in the financial system.  Just remember that the whole point of saying something is ""decentralized"" is to remove the power from the 1% and give it into the 99%.  People need to sort through all this deception and misinformation because it is being used against us.  Focus on the technology that breaks this cycle of control.  This is not just about who owns the GitHub respository, it's about *who owns the system*. "
Fuck Core. You just read and see what you want to see. My point was you cant replace something when you haven't even reached %10 adoption level. You're dreaming.

I don't believe anyone. I look at the tech. We don't need innovation, Satoshi gave us plenty of that.
"It's the only bigblock blockchain afaik, so atleast it's unique in that regard...

The downside of ""innovation"" is feature creep (segwit/lightning) adding complexity to a system that should be as simple as possible to keep it decentralized. The biggest failure point of BTC is that it can only be maintained by elitist coders"
See my comment above. 
"Roger Ver is a hardcore libertarian and likes crypto because it can’t be touched by government. He’s going to turn his nose up to government regulation every chance he gets.

That’s why he’s arguing for insider trading to “not be a crime.” He thinks central authority is bad and that insider trading should be punished by market forces.

He might be wrong, but that’s not dishonest. The man is literally shopping around looking to buy land to found a country with no government."
">That's my question as well.  I think we have a problem with the way Bitcoin and its variants are managed.

Well technically it wasn’t insider trader.

Insider trader involve buying the company stocks.. not a currency/commodity that trade a company. This is (whatever you like it or not) is 100% legal.

>The reason I got into crypto was for giving people an equal standing in the financial system.  

How don’t know how one can built a 100% equals/fair financial system?

It sound a bit naive.

And how BCH is not?

>People need to sort through all this deception and misinformation because it is being used against us.  

Example?

>Focus on the technology that breaks this cycle of control.  This is not just about who owns the GitHub respository, it's about *who owns the system*. 

And again how can one could « own » BCH?

so far the best example I can think of is BTC with blockstream that sell solutions to a crippled chain **and** hire dev that can prevent any blocksize limit increase.

This is a concrete example of open source project being captured.

Can you give a concrete example with BCH?"
You need to look a little further than Satoshi because Bitcoin is no longer the competition.  
Are you referring to my comment?  I don't see any lashing and I don't see any BTC or XRP. 
"See my previous comment on the topic of ""decentralization"". "
Can you elaborate?
Yes, whatever.  You're reading as if it were a block-buster movie instead of reality.  Decentralization is about the people, not just one man.  You again trust the 1% to empower the people when there's no precedent to suggest that someone in control of a money supply will act in anyone's interests except their own.  Least of all those who thumb their nose at principles that attempt to guide moral behavior in the market.
Then You are either blind or in denial. 
What are you talking about? I didn’t say he was right. It’s just his philosophy. The guy doesn’t want any government. Why would he be in favor of government regulation.
.. Or you're emotional. 
Oh the irony. Butthurt BTCers are shitting their britches by banker coin XRP, the coin they want to emulate, has to lash out here on BCH.
"In this case it's not a choice, it's a consequence of how the system works.  

But they did give almost all of it away for free.

The whitepaper isn't very long and I thinks it's easy to understand, only the part about avoiding double-spends is a little bit more complex, so I suggest you read it. If you've already read a few you can also skip a bunch of sections."
"Oh and i thought nobody cared. Learn to read what words actually mean. Core didn't get to this level in 6 months. Also show something that Core is dying slowly because not many people are buying BTC for transaction. 
Your words doesn't have any sense now. BCH's road is so far away and you're talking like its already done."
u-sharanelcsy apparently doesn't frequent r/btc often. Probably didn't frequent r/bitcoin often either, until maybe the last couple of months. 
"> Where do you draw the line?

Blockchain + Proof-of

No any type of work done, any type of checkpoints/masternodes exist - not an open blockchain. Tethers should be delisted as well as Ripple, or better listed as closed blockchains"
"That is ludacrious. 

I would be happy to die a poor man in a free world, VS a rich man in an enslaved one.

The Crypto Community was almost void of these types of people in years past. I assure you a large chunk of Crypto-enthusiasts care more about morals and values VS. a quick buck assisted by banks. 

By accusing everyone else of being ""Jealous"" and ""Missed the boat"", you and them are simply belittling others under the assumption we are all chasing money. But guess what, you are just proving your own negligent greed. 

If i was Marty Mc.Fly, and my comic book said ""Ripple: $452.31"", I still would not invest when I go back in time. I have more apparent ideological thinking than to willingly play in to preserving the banking influence on society.

The incentive for Raiblocks is to keep the network running, which as a business that relies on it you will want to do. The nodes can be simple computers, so not expensive at all to buy and maintain. 
"Please read up on Railblocks, its design is not centralized at all and it allows for instant transactions with 0 fees. It's insanely cool!

The design does force that all coins exist from the start but they were given out for free via a faucet with a captcha.

Unlike IOTA, there's no coordinator bullshit. "
I bought $300 bucks worth of Tether a few months ago at $1, the price has been pretty steady at around $1.02 - $1.04. I hope Coinbase will list it soon so it can breakout to like $5 so I could make some mad gains.
dude is trolling
It actually mooned to $1.02 a while ago.
No, BCH. And ripple is also not a cryptocurrency, nor decentralized.
">People who researched Bitcoin before investing probably meant to invest in what they researched. Changing the fundamental aspects of this investment without their permission or want is unethical. 

The Bitcoin whitepaper is the specification of Bitcoin, a high level overview that should persists as relevant for all of Bitcoin's life. That's what a whitepaper is. If someone wants a system with full blocks, high fees, forced middlemen(LN), or full nodes with power, then what they want is not Bitcoin.

Let us use this simple analogy as a thought experiment to see why people feel the way they do.

*Imagine*

You read about a new steakhouse with very tasty steaks.     
You go to there, read the menu, pick out the best steak and order it.

No Imagine they bring you scrambled eggs instead. No steak. You went to the steak house, you ordered a steak, you were expecting a steak, but they brought you something else.

You complain to the waiter who tells you the cooks are experts with food and they know better than you. The cooks decided scrambled eggs would be better for you without your input or consent. 

The waiter asks why you are upset? He says he doesn't understand.         
You wanted food, they brought you food, why are you upset? The cooks are smarter than you, they know what you want better than you, you should be grateful for their input says the waiter.


This is how most Bitcoin users feel, that what they wanted (bitcoin) is not what they have (legacy bitcoin).

yeah but what are these people doing on r/btc? this is the last sub I would expect to find any ripple holders
"35 years of successful tech investing under my belt. I’m not pumping squat. I own 7 and only 7 cryptos that all have solid use cases. I won’t outline them here. And I buy for the long term. 

The myth that XRP won’t be used is a lazy investor’s way to dismiss it without doing the research.

"Doesn’t imply that at all. You don’t make investments based on love or hate. Doing a dispassionate due diligence on any investment is just common since. 

And don’t twist my words: who gives a fuck what bitcoiners thought about Ripple/XRP in 2013?  The opinions are completely irrelevant to the value of the company, the technology or XRP the currency in 2018. 

Don’t like it or think it will succeed? Perfect. Don’t buy it.  But don’t act all incredulous when someone else does and they turn out to be right. 

I don’t care what XRP price does tomorrow or next week. It will no doubt be volatile as hell. But it will also be standing in 2020 as a useful cryptoasset while many of the darling projects of the crypto world fall by the wayside. "
To each his own. I am of the opinion that money creation should be taken away from banks. 
I am a someone, many other people are someone, we all care and support BCH. Also Core is dying as we speak, ever so slowly.
I never said banks are going away any times soon. What will happen over time, many years and decades, is that people will go more and more into decentralisation... and no... 1100 crypto will not provide that, most of them are not even decentralised, nor currencies. Bitcoin system (Bitcoin Cash) will do this.
So much stupid trust in banks, its unbelievable. Lets see how that much that trust erodes away when the next big financial crisis occurs, caused by the banks
Please add a USD/EUR pair so people will pump EUR by 100% in two days.
Bitshares lists bitGold and bitUSD. What point are you trying to make? It would be better to ask Coinmarketcap and the Exchanges what the criteria are.
"That's what I was asking, what is the incentive to keep the network running, if you weren't part of the premine / company.   ""The design does force that all coins exist from the start"" <-- well that's a choice.  Premining is a choice developers can make or not when they start a coin.  If the premine is 100%, you are no longer decentralized.  Could still be a great system though, I'll check it out thanks for the recommendation.  "
You have to be trolling, there’s no way..
Not centralized like BCH which is primarily comtrolled by 2 people.. 
"""The technology we have developed, it separated a connection from the cryptocurrency or the token. So what that means is that a bank or non-bank like AMEX can use Ripple to connect and just exchange value from one fiat currency to another directly, without the need for any intermediate blockchain currency.""

From Marcus Treacher, global head of strategic accounts at Ripple

You don’t have a clue. Get out of this and any decentralized crypto sub. "
"I could not care less what Ripple does. I would not go so far as to say *I hate it* but I certainly dislike aspects of the project and purpose and thus have no interest. There are investment paths that I do hate on moral and ethical grounds, and I also ignore those. So maybe I'm misinterpreting your use of ""love and hate"" in the context of a reddit sub but I most definitely make (investment) decisions based upon (loose definitions of) love and hate. "
!RemindMe 2 years
With XRP it is because they are pre-mined. There are 100 billion coins and they are not going to be extended in amount. In case banks would all agree on using it we would put all value being moved into the asset which is fixed in its number of existence. When banks screw around and print fiat money you see it. With XRP the bullshit debt game should actually be ended at some point, but this is a bit far from here. Anyway, this would be my vision because the card house is quite instable and untrusted. It is the best card house we came up with so far though. 
"Is that the metric that CoinMarketCap uses?

So if Bitfinex adds a Gold/USD pair that means no. 1 spot on CoinMarketCap will be Gold? "
> unironically thinking crypto will replace banks 
"Technically yes, They are not mined by miners. I know that.  XRP is not PoW.  But most people don’t mine so it means little to the average investor while people use the argument like it means anything.  

Mined coins matters when you can actually mine them. That is not possible for most people with btc especially and in many cases BCH. 

Edit: to be more clear, the average investor does not care if all the xrp was created at once (which technically isn’t premined) or if a miner mined them into existence after an ICO or launch.   It’s noise to anyone who isn’t deep in the culture. "
"Face it, crypto went mainstream. That’s what everyone said they wanted. Well. This is what mainstream looks like.

My bank values me as a customer and has helped me out of a few jams over the years. I like my bank. My bank has never been hacked for 100’s of millions. My bank lets me challenge a transaction when there’s a problem. My bank is available to me 24/7 worldwide. And my bank doesn’t charge me $30 to send money or require super secret private hexadecimal key codes to access my money. 

Banks aren’t going away. Utopia cannot transcend practicality. "
"Why is this sub attacking Ripple now instead of its usual attack on Bitcoin? What did Ripple do to it?
"
"Haters gonna hate. Potatoes gonna potate. 

Sorry you missed the train. "
Who the fuck runs coinmarketcap.com? They shouldn’t even be listing Ripple on their website.

Yep and neither is LN 
The people get what the people deserve!
/r/btc is a living avatar of the No True Scotsman fallacy.
"Since it's inception ripple always felt like the ""hello fellow kids"" meme but with Bitcoin being the kids and banks being Buchemi."
"Wait, the value in blockchain tech isn't limited to mining coins and never has been. That may be the intent for cryptocurrency in general but blockchain has many uses in information validation, which is incredibly valuable without attaching the label of digital currency to transactions on those networks. if the banks have all gotten together in a huddle and decided to solve some of their issues with their systems (like them losing customer data or being hacked or suffering from regular human error in computation or whatever else), and XRP is how they've decided to do that, that's valuable both monetarily (to those of us who aren't a bank and are buying it) and to society (since it provides a net benefit). 

Now, if your gripe is that that's not the point of crypto, fine, so be it. But if your gripe is that no one should buy this because it doesn't satisfy your particular, unique idea about what **blockchain** should be about in general, then I have news for you. You're going to quickly find yourself in even more of a minority than you already are being on this sub."
Ripple will be more decentralized then Bitcoin by the end of 2018. For every two independent validating nodes a Ripple node is removed until they are all gone. Meanwhile BTC is owned by Chinese miners. 
BTC is not mineable too - when you don't have millions for mining HW of course!
Bitcoin Cash is not a cyrptocurrency, it is a psychological insider trading experiment gone wrong that Coinbase tried to capitalize on in December 2017. Never forget.  
Honestly the anti ripple sentiment of the last couple of days is quite sad and reminiscent of the BTC bitching about BCH. Yes it’s pre-mined. Yes it’s a token. Yes it’s a banker coin. Some of us here own it and like it. Sure, it’s the anti bitcoin, but stop trying to tear it down. We only make ourselves look jealous and shallow. 
WTF gets this posted in this sub?

I posted a post about this back when Emmanuel Macron was elected in r/conspiracy. Ripple spiked a ton right after he was elected. He's a former banker and is heavily involved with elites. There was also some picture of him involved with crypto somehow. 
TBH anyone buying crypto currency now is interested in profiting from the bubble.
Yep, my coworker bought into it for exactly this. I definitely let him know it wasn’t the best idea, but he is an adult and if he wants to gamble, more power to him.
Sounds like Bitcoin Core 
"The analogy is nowhere near the mark. Banks exist almost solely in digital form already. The transition to DLT and public blockchain integration will ensure their survival. Just as discussed in one of the best books on crypto investing:


https://www.amazon.com/Cryptoassets-Innovative-Investors-Bitcoin-Beyond/dp/1260026671

The value is with tech that works. Solutions to specific problems. Actual uses. 

I’m often reminded of Microsoft vs Windows, Apple vs PC, and Xbox vs PlayStation fan boy arguments as I read the crypto subreddits. Investing isn’t a game. It isn’t a popularity contest. It’s real business. And Ripple will have a good share of it. 
"
Or, they are just adding it to their portfolio.
"There actually is a moral argument fir xrp...

It's to do with freeing up $27 trillion locked up in nostro accounts.

A $10 xrp is quntifiable based on tangible assumptions without speculation given the 5 tr dollars of x-border settlements, the 27 tr dollars locked up in nostro accounts alone. It also enables 95% of the 11000 banks on the swift network to transfer peer to peer instead of proxying cross border through the mega-banks.

Xrp can do a lot of good...! Fiat is debt based... mainly issued to governments and we all pay the interest. We are paying bong debt via put taxes for $27 trillion which is locked up... without getting benefit... xrp can release some of that... and that's a good thing... surely
"
Sorry cryptoanarchists, your fantasy was just that. 
Whatever, I bought in at .8 sold half at 2.3. Letting the rest of it ride. 
Hope ripple wins it all. Good idea and it works. 
Truth to be told : I see stellar in actual use before ripple.. 
I purchased 500 XRP's at $2.89 today. Seemed like a good deal at the time.
Still more real than the Lightning Network.
No. 1 is unusable.. probably 1st target of banks to destroy.. No.2 is for banks.. well, they win
"Worse than that, actually: it's a network run by a private company. Their marketing material says it's for banks, but there's zero evidence that banks are even interested in public blockchains.

Public network is used only by cryptocurrency exchanges, as you can see here: https://xrpcharts.ripple.com/#/xrp-markets

Bithumb, Binance, Bitfinex, Poloniex... These are banks using Ripple. :D

Ripple has a separate private network product for banks, not connected to XRP in any way.

Is it true that you must buy 20 ripple just to be able to open an account then never be able to spend those 20 ripple?  Wtf. This would get expensive as fuck
blockchain?  i don't think so.  Show me a block.  
Why is it even listed on CoinMarketCap is my question.
"-It has real world use - today

-It falls in line with current regulations in the fintech world

-It can transfer billions of dollars in 4 seconds

-It can transfer that money for less than a penny

-It is premined but frankly- most of the people here are buying premined coins. Your not mining them 

-100 billion coins ... wgaf when the market it’s going after a trillion dollar industry

-Asians love it and if it gets adopted into the P2P payment space it’s going to have very fast legs

-doesn’t have a schism dividing the community between two coins unless you count Stellar but Ripple won’t devolve I to what BTC vs BCH has become. That schism creates FUD about the name Bitcoin

At a bare minimum, if you are a tech investor in this space, you should be doing the corporate play, “ripple” , and the non-corporate play with good tech and use cases that are live solving real world problems now - about 3-4 other coins.  

If your a decentralized anti bank purist, keep driving on. It’s going to be a very bumpy road for you. "
This what this sub does,just simply hate on any coin which is more valuable than their's

I think it is run by a small team of devs who are trying to pretend it is run by banks, but it is not"
XRP tokens are not only centralized and private but also useless, they were meant to be a web payment gateway. And it was used like that in the early days. Bitstamp for example would accept deposits in XRP that you would buy directly from Ripple that would be converted to USD. You could not trade XRP at Bitstamp, it was just a gateway to USD. Then the payment gateway original concept was abandoned and those tokens became legacy in Ripple's system. Ripple is a company that makes custom solutions to banks, some already in use, and none of those solutions includes using the token XRP.
IOTA and RaiBlocks are not mineable coins, yet they are cryptocurrencies unlike Ripple.
Okay? 
"It seems to like it's the Lightning Network without the security of a public settlement network like Bitcoin. I wonder how many banks in other countries are willing to put their business in the hands of a small federation and company with access to over 55% of the value used as collateral. 

The selling point with Bitcoin is that nobody practically has majority control over the network. With current power distribution in Ripple that's much harder to sell.

I think Ripple is an improvement over the existing banking system when it comes to technology, but the systemic risk for a country could be too large if their banks are controlled by this group. "

If I were to buy them at $0.002 like I remember them being, would I only own legacy xrp, and not the $2+ shitcoin that I see today?
"I'm very skeptical of IOTA, see [IOTA is centralized
by Eric Wall](https://medium.com/@ercwl/iota-is-centralized-6289246e7b4d).

If there was a formal proof that the decentralized system worked, they wouldn't need the centralized coordinator node. If they cannot prove that their system works without centralization (like Bitcoin does), they're not a decentralized currency.

(I'm not sure whether decentralization is required for something to be considered a ""cryptocurrency"" though)"
IOTA isn't censorfree for now. Until coordinator is out, it isn't an open blockchain

">I wonder how many banks in other countries are willing to put their business in the hands of a small federation and company with access to over 55% of the value used as collateral.

Since they can just form their own currency where the banks hold the majority of the value, I see no incentive for them to use Ripple. Banks aren't going to just hand over a lot of value to a bunch of speculators when they have no legal obligation to do so."
They recently put the majority holdings in an escrow account with timed release. So banks and economists are not scared about a flood rush over abundance of these coins on the market. Do your research before spreading FUD.

"It's the opposite, actually. 

Ripple Inc. still owns around 60 billion XPR, worth 140 billion dollars at current price.

That's a lot of fucking money. It's a lot of money even for large banks.

Let me assure you, they do not make anything close to that from their private blockchain products. Their products are sold as fee-cutting, so they really can't charge more than few cents per transactions. So they make maybe few million dollars from that.

XRP is their cash cow. They created a myth that Ripple Inc. relationship with banks will create a lot of use for XRP in the long term, and crypto traders were happy to buy it.

It used to be the other way around, but in 2017 public crypto got a huge boost while there's still practically no use of private blockchains."
"It's hard to tell exactly how much power Ripple Labs and ""issuing addresses"" have since the ""rules"" seem to change frequently.  Information in one document is left out of updated documents.

One thing the developers mention frequently is that you should endeavor to understand completely how the ledger operates so you are not surprised by how the ledger behaves.

[Here's a 2015 article about Ripple asking Bitstamp to freeze an account.](https://cointelegraph.com/news/ripple-directs-bitstamp-to-freeze-funds-of-former-co-founder-jed-mccaleb)

From what I've read this morning, I think they have introduced more ways for both Ripple and ""issuing addresses"" to freeze or reverse accounts and transactions.  It's hard to tell exactly what they can do because the documentation isn't clear, isn't centrally located, and seems to become more concise and general as it's updated.

At this point I view a Ripple address as the equivalent of a Visa gift card. "
"You could be right, but banks aren’t going to be using XRP, just the ripple protocol and privately. Ripple as a company will benefit, but that does nothing for XRP at all. 

I’m sure all of the bitcoiners from at least 2012/2013 will remember how laughable ripple was in the community. It’s a fucking joke to even consider it a cryptocurrency because it’s not. I’m usually open to alts, but this thing is and always will be a piece of shit that ensures the status quo. 

I own some from a while back that someone randomly gave me to test out and I really fucking hate myself for having it still. 

FD: I’m fucking down a lot of money this week, and ripple going up while REAL cryptos are down is fucking stupid.

BCH should be #2 if not ETH. 

EDIT: today to this week. "
banks have equity stakes in ripple the company, although no bank i am aware of plan to use ripple the token as a currency
Writing in CAPS just makes you look pathetic.
How so?  They are company coins, just like ripple corp, centralized ledgers.  Right?    
They can also freeze any wallet at any time without any warning. 1984 fidget spinner coin. 
Banks as we know them are going away. They are cesspools.
Crypto is years and years away from helping the unbanked. You need to be banked to buy crypto at the moment.
"Not true at all, in fact, you can fight them (and we do) AND profit from it.

Siding with banks to make a profits just makes you an ass of a man... just like the bankers."
Except you can't. XRP isn't going to be used by banks. Maybe some variant or fork of Ripple technologies will be utilized though.
"> CODE IS NOT OPEN SOURCE, SO malicious efforts can be made. 

https://github.com/ripple/rippled"
Do you know in which way no semi-private blockchain can comete with an open blockchain? In giving the receiving party a guarantee that these funds will never be charged back. This is crucial in an open anonymous space like the internet
"I'll tell you something funny that is true. When Ripple first started, they got on Reddit and offered Bitcoin users 1000 ripple if you could prove you owned Bitcoin. The strategy was to get those already knowledgeable about crypto to start talking about it. 

Long story short, I'm sitting on a free $2k right now."
I've read that they're able to black list your ripples...is that correct?
"Yes, the wallet reserve is a true thing. But the wallet reserve amount can be adjusted and that locked in Ripple gets released for usage again. Also that reserve is solely used for transaction fees. From what I have read, at one point the reserve was something like 150 XRP back when it was sitting below a penny, but was lowered as the price of XRP increased.

So it would only get expensive if you as an individual are trying to create a ton of accounts...which is part of the purpose as well since it reduces the number of accounts being created for the purpose of congesting the network of obfuscating where funds end up."
It's nowhere near censorfree
Just so you get annoyed. 
Newspapers aren't going away either. <cough>
Should CoinMarketCap censor certain coins? Really disappointing comment of yours
I am most definitely anti-bank when it comes to cryptocurrency. It's not about getting rich for me. It's about something bigger.

Exactly. Alts took a shit today. Ripple did not. Just give your investments time and stop focusing on today. Damn.
This sub does a lot more than that. However they really are very salty about Ripple. It's the free unregulated market, just accept it.

Sorry, I cannot help. Plenty of other readers on this thread will understand.
They did nothing wrong, really you're made because you aren't being coddled in the real world, grow up
Nope, just annoyed that a supposedly transparent company wasn't transparent at all about a pretty big movement, which clearly was not ready at all.
"😂😂😂 ""The real world""


What part of cryptocurrency and an exchange introducing a new cryptocurrency got to do with being coddled in the real world??


They absolutely did do something wrong, it's a shame you cannot see that but okay, that's not my problem but yours.


The real truth is you are just sad and confused and wanna bash out at someone cuz you are realising that BCH is just a curtain for shady operations. Hence the sending of the piddly amount of BCH to try and get something out of me, but instead we got a nearly instantaneous cry from you for no reason, but shows that you're feeling a little fragile.


Grow up."

Surprise surprise, a 4 year old coin has 3x tx volume than a 4 months old coin,
Price is made through trading on information. The name Bitcoin Cash communicates that it's a Bitcoin fork with the intent of being Bitcoin and cash again. That's important information both for users and investors.
Because in the end, who cares what it's called. I just want it to be successful.
"If such a fork existed and was not a cheap PR stunt or just an attempt to troll yet again, it would have to have much more in common technically than just being ""private""' or ""anonymous"". 

We don't have to interpret his writings as if it was a religious document. He stated very clearly his reasoning and design."
"The Bitcoin Cash developers and community chose the name. It's disrespectful to ignore their choice and use something that has been explained to be wrong already.  

The forks you mention simply exist to grab money from uninformed users and/or confuse people about Bitcoin Cash. But I'm sure you are aware of the reasons for these other forks, equally aware of the reason why Bitcoin cash came into being. "
Being successful depends partly on having the right name and marketing it as a quality brand, backed by its actual performance ... Allowing any old name, even a slur from opponents is not a good choice and does not help it become the number one crypto currency. 
Wasn't that long ago they had the same transaction volume... Is it that much of a shocker that people prefer to use a quick fast easy to transact blockchain (LTC) instead of a slow sluggish one (BCH)?
Was thinking the same this morning, I quite like it
It's completely related. It's supply and demand. Only the highest bidders can fit within the limited block size be it a hard cap or a soft cap. Bitcoin doesn't have $50 fees because of wallet software, it has it because of supply and demand.
I agree, not sure why Bitcoin cash was chosen as the name at fork. I would've prefered just Bitcoin and no replay protection. 
You can honestly call it whatever you like, and nobody will give a flying fuck
"> Indeed the future for LTC is a different transaction capacity onchain than BCH. It's worth noting though that with Segwit LTC is around same transaction capacity as BCH today. By the time LTC reaches it's capacity LN will likely be ready anyways.

As virtually no transactions actually make use of SegWit, that really isn't relevant, nor does it change the fact that BCH will not have comparable fees if it has the same transaction volume LTC does today, which was your original claim.

> You don't know that. That's all up to the market and the miners game theory.

I'm not making a prediction on how that works out, I'm explaining that this is the idea behind the scaling roadmap."
"There already exists an entirely different payment system known as BCash. 

The ""bcash"" slur in our case was invented as a propaganda tool by already triggered Core devs and supporters so they could have it spammed all across the interwebs. "
tx vol is unrelated to fee, there is no way you can be right therefore and that makes you a liar, better, the only reason fees are an average of a few cents instead of less than a cent is that people have software which isn't ready for bitcoin
That's possible, but I think, that name will remain intact. Peer-to-peer electronic cash, Bitcoin
People were also objecting to it long before Ver threw a fit over it. It dates back to when the term was first introduced. Some Core supporting trolls just love to pretend everything is about Roger and his evil money or Jihan Wu and his evil mining empire or whatever else.
"You have to say 'false', not wrong...

"Wouldn't the best way to stick it to those guys be to adopt the name. I honestly don't care that much, but if our reaction to it was ""sure, whatever we know it's referring to Bitcoin Cash"" then they don't win the argument."
in the follow up he said what broke him was the guy saying bcash despite roger asking him not to
I understand the official name having bitcoin in it, but trying to police people's nicknames of a crypto seems like such a waste of time. 
[deleted]
Not _just like_. Most other forks created were scams or troll attempts invented by Core and their supporters. An altcoin is a coin trying to be something different than Bitcoin, which is to say by changing the fundamentals expressed in the white paper and by Satoshi himself on p2pfoundation and BitcoinTalk. Bitcoin Cash is doing the opposite.
No. Bitcoin Cash *is* Bitcoin as described in the White paper. No reason why a product that follows the spec & goals from WP more closely than Bitcoin Core should not be named correctly.
I'd say that was a narrative based on false information
We still have the whitepaper, but social context makes Bitcoin an impractical name most of the time as of now. That's where the market based emergent consensus comes into play.
In the white paper Satoshi masks his true identity suggesting Bitcoin should in fact be private and anonymous if the user so chooses. This was his underlying vision for Bitcoin. As such it is safe to say Bitcoin Private is the real Bitcoin.
">in the follow up he said what broke him was the guy saying bcash despite roger asking him not to

This is a blatant lie. If you listened past the first 30 seconds of the video you know this."
Wouldn't want to call it Bcoin for Bitcoin, would you?

Because there's already a company using that name. https://bcash.com.br
The article still needed correcting. There are plenty of reasons to use and support a coin with a more serious purpose and agenda.
"https://coingeek.com/bitcoin-cash-introduce-new-address-format-avoid-confusion-btc-bch-addresses/

Roger is ""pumping"" it the same as he was ""pumping"" Bitcoin for years already. By doing PR and building companies around it. Consider that he has a lot of wealth in BTC and now also BCH. It was never in his interest to simply ruin Bitcoin. Nor would it be in the interest of Jihan Wu (Bitmain). Instead they have bootstrapped a fork and are slowly transfering their wealth there.

They could have simpled HODLD their coins, watched as investors drove Bitcoin much higher and had a more liquid market to sell into later. But they didn't. Instead they are emptying their own BTC pockets slowly and at some point, should they not decide to stop, they won't have any left.

The actual reason for the fork was a long debate, which was not open and fair but often censored and manipulated. BTC devs don't care about Satoshi or the original vision we had going anymore. It's not the main chain that they want to see adopted. They are in it to build a product on top of the blockchain, which is likely to be more easily censored and shut down. They think high fees on the main chain are a good thing."
you can show that this is not true with math
"False. BCH will not have the same fees when it has the same transaction volume as LTC, and LTC doesn't have the same fees as BTC did at the same volume.

---

BTC 1MB blocks per 10 minutes = 6MB/hour

LTC 1MB blocks per 2.5 minutes = 24MB/hour

BCH 8MB blocks per 10 minutes = 48MB/hour

BCH 32MB blocks per 10 minutes (soon) = 192MB/hour

---

Today, BCH can handle twice (48/24) LTC's maximum transaction volume before fees become important, and once the planned fork to 32MB goes through, it will be able to handle (192/24) 8 times LTC's maximum transaction volume before that point.

BCH's blocksize is below 100k still on average, meaning it can handle at least 320 times the current volume before we run into any kind of scaling issue causing the fees to rise.

The roadmap for BCH is that the blocksize is scaled _before_ transaction volume exceeds available space, keeping fees below 0.2 _cents_."
Not really, bch  has actual scaling roadmap and timeline instead of lightening vaporware being pitched for LTC. 
should have just named it Bitcoin.fork#
Agreed, but this seems irrelevant to OP. 
"No. Miners want fees and zero fee transactions permit a lot of spamming. Technically you can send no fee transactions on BCH as could you with Bitcoin. Don't expect them to go through (or in the case of BCH to be very delayed).

One of the things  many miners on this sub forget about is miners want fees they also don't want their blocks to be orphaned. So miners impose soft caps on the block size for the blocks they mine and only up those softcaps as they feel necessary. So again only the highest bidders can work their way into the blocks. This earn miners more fees and it reduces their orphan rate by decreasing block propagation time. Miners will only up the soft caps when they feel it necessary to prevent users from abandoning the blockchain their mining and when they feel the risk/reward of increased orphan rates are worth it and to be made up for by higher volume of transactions. "
Why is the name Bcash so offensive to some Bitcoin supporters? Asking as a casual observer. 
Is there a GitHub repo or anything for Bcash? All I can find when Googling is the announcement post and a Reddit post asking for an update that received no response.
"No, BCash is only widely understood by trolls and by the Bitcoin Cash community which mostly rejects it.

Personally, I'm fine with the name. But Bitcoin Cash emphazises that we are reestablishing real Bitcoin, not an altcoin. BCash is an already existing payments service. https://bcash.com.br"
Bcash
BCASH is catchy .... i kind of like it ... why you guys are not using it
Why he just didn't start a coin from scratch. Like Charlie lee... why same name same address format ... I don't get it !  Is like stealing don't you think.  Is like a cheap Chinese copy of a good brand 
I think roger is a conartist  ...  and he is not transparent .... that worries me
Is super confusing and it has same address format ... and sounds like roger ver is pumping it ... looks super sketchy 
Why didn't he fix the order they are listed in? 
It's important to note the only reason for this is that LTC is handling more than 3x the transaction volume of BCH. If BCH had that same transaction volume chances are fees would be comparable. Much like how not long ago LTC and BCH fees were the same when they were handling the same transaction volume. 
Another reason why it should not be called Bcash, is because that is also the name of a Brazilian Escrow service.
r/litecoin
$0.05 is still higher than you need for most transactions 
"As long as you have miners willing to process zero fee transactions things look really good. Just a quick visual scan of the blockchain demonstrates that. Unfortunately, it's temporary. View it as a promotional period ( Definitely, don't make the mistake of thinking it's permanent (unless you like being naive). 

Besides, the fact is the fees for both coins is next to nothing."
Kyle Torpey, Andreas Antonopoulos: banksters' best friend
You’re right. It’s BTrash.
How would that be disrespectful for the community, and why would they take any offense to it in the first place? Bitcoin Cash is indeed a fork of BTC, just like Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Plus, Bitcoin Diamond and soon to be Bitcoin Cash Plus. 
"That's what we should answer every time some troll spams ""bcash"" in twitter feed."
"Indeed the future for LTC is a different transaction capacity onchain than BCH. It's worth noting though that with Segwit LTC is around same transaction capacity as BCH today. By the time LTC reaches it's capacity LN will likely be ready anyways.

>volume exceeds available space, keeping fees below 0.2 cents.

You don't know that. That's all up to the market and the miners game theory. "
"dear god no

anyone sane ever make that comparison? 

"
"Because Core supporters call it bcash on purpose to avoid it having the Bitcoin name. I understand their frustration, because a hard fork of a coin should always have the name of the original included since they have the same genesis block.

But I do agree that it's been getting ridiculous. It's become an easy way for Core supporters to trigger BCH supporters without any effort at all."
That's not what caused him to have a meltdown... It was trolling before, during the interview and then basically implying all of us that are not on Cores side are just shills being paid by him.
Also https://bcash.com.br for the real BCash.

"That doesn't change the fact that LTC *currently* is handling more than 3x the transaction volume.


Litecoin processed [over 156,000 transaction over past 24 hours](https://bitinfocharts.com/litecoin/)

By contrast [BCH processed around 44,000 over the same time span.](https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin%20cash/)


Can't blame people for wanting to transact with a coin that is fast. "
Sounds more like the majority of the coins value comes from having Bitcoin in the name.
Bcash is really dead now. Ripple eth and bitcoin are dominating. Sell up guys and move to coins above you before its too late :(
"Wrong. There have been several 8 MB blocks.

What about BitCash?
"That's a problem though. We don't know that it won't just continue morphing and somehow be saved , even it's an entirely different project from what Satoshi intended. So no matter if it dies or not we need a working name.

Bitcoin Cash or Cash works for now. Bitcoin alone not so much at this stage and perhaps ever."
"I see what you are saying, but I think the marketing is more important than the name chosen. Bitcoin could be the Myspace of crypto, and Bitcoin Cash could be the Facebook for all we know. If that's the case, then the name Bitcoin could hurt us just as much as it appears to help now. Even now, I imagine some people have heard that bitcoin has problems, so they stay away from bitcoin cash too. I think most of the people who tout the paper as why it's the real bitcoin are technical people who read all the details. The general public that we need to start supporting it are probably just going to go by whats on the news and not think any deeper into it.

TLDR; Relying on the bitcoin name could turn out to be a double edged sword. Marketing is where the focus should lie."
$1 /u/tippr
Yeah fees have to be non-zero to combat spam. Otherwise they're still dirt cheap to use.
It doesn't mater if the hard cap is full as each mining pool will impose a soft cap of their choosing. They still prioritize by fee and if too many transactions occur that don't fit in the current soft cap they'll be delayed and placed is other blocks that would of otherwise not have been full. 
"It's not half as offensive as Core supporters would have you believe, but 1 there's already a company payment service called that, 2 the term was invented as a smear by the Core camp, 3 it removes Bitcoin entirely from the name so that it is more likely to be confused with BCash and not be connected with Bitcoin or Satoshi.

And for all of the trolls that love to link the video of Roger Ver flipping out on camera (yep, that was pretty unsmooth) 1 he's not our lord and savior, there is no master of Bitcoin Cash, (he got the nick Bitcoin Jesus from BTC hodlers when he handed out the currency to spur adoption) 2 He wasn't primarily triggered by ""BCash"" but by the ""interviewers"" obvious troll claim that the rest of us are simply his paid shills. He probably wouldn't have bothered having the discussion if he knew how poorly spent his time would have been."
Or Bitcoin cash, litecoin wannabe?
OK makes sense. That video was weird, for sure. It's only 3 syllables, doesn't really need an abbreviation. It's less of a mouthful than Ethereum. 
More than anything, it's an already existing payments company.

He's always been a BCH supporter by satirizing what core supporter say. The problem is that the satire flies way above the head of most redditors, that coupled with the fact that it's hard to exaggerate what core supporters actually *do* say, you end up buried in downvotes.
"> How does one pay at a shop like this?

Through qr codes. A simple App like Coinomi will do just fine:

* receive/send through qr codes;

* local currency selection;

* transaction fee selection;

* monitoring through transactions history;

> How long would the transaction take place? And what fee?

This is Bitcoin Cash. Zero-conf. No need to wait. You pay and go! If customer is also using coinomi, he can set the fee to zero too!

> If BTC, this would be impossible currently right?

Y - E - S"
Ahh, I see now. 
Do both parties have to be using coinimi to set zero fees? What if one is using coinimi and the other is using something else (like what?) And why would anyone set anything other than zero fees? Why would anyone want to pay fees, the shop doesn't want the customer to pay fees, and the customer doesn't want to pay fees. Where would the fees even go? 
Tx fees aside, ELI5 why zero conf is fine with BCH but not with BTC? 
BCH unlike BTC, has no 'chargeback' option where you can replace your already-sent txn with a new one in an attempt to defraud the recipient.
Btc is chargebackable? How is that possible 
Aren't RBF transactions clearly flagged as such? Or are you talking about another chargeback feature I'm not aware of? 
Yup. That cancerous RBF can be use stealthily by fraudsters to fuck the merchants in the ass. It's the main reason why BCH slammed it hard into the trashcan where it belongs. 😂
What's rbf
"Most receiving wallets are not smart enough to show a tx as RBF. And even if they are, the merchant needs to specify a complicated payment process where they tell the user pay in crypto, but dont use RBF. Then the user would say: I dont know if I have RBF on. The merchant would then need to have some tech support to help the user figure it out.

This is high amount of friction and will cause most merchants to ""Nope"" out of accepting such crypto. Imagine a merchant accepting $100 cash needing to check if the Ben Franklin on the note is winking and if so, the cash could just disappear from the register over the next 4 hours. Its simpler to not accept $100 than to create a process and train all cashiers on how to properly handle $100 bills.

"
Again, aren't RBF transactions clearly flagged as such, especially if the merchant uses a payment processor like Bitpay?... 
Replace by fee
"I don't know about the US, but here in Europe cashiers definitely need to be trained to handle €100 bills, they always check them for counterfeits... But anyway, that's besides the point.

The fact that most receiving wallets are not smart enough to show a tx as RBF is indicative of a problem with most receiving wallets, not RBF itself, and honestly, I don't think we're at a stage where **most merchants** can use **most wallets yet**. I think we can agree that we absolutely need to get there eventually, but I don't think neither BTC nor BCH, nor any other crypto is really there yet.

Besides, while the market is still so volatile, payment processors like bitpay play a very important role. There's not going to be more people arguing with a merchant that's telling them that their payment processor doesn't take those kind of transactions than there are arguments because a merchants POS won't take American Express.

As more adoption of crypto continues to spread and the prices consequently begin to stabilise, merchants will be able to move their slider on their bitpay account page to keep ever higher proportions of crypto. And such adoption will require software such as wallets to improve greatly. Meaning that by the time *""most merchant""* are willing to go full crypto and stop using processors, wallets should definitely be much better. "
So RBF transactions can be charged back? How do you know when it clears (or is it always chargebackable?) 
Whatever your imagination desires. 😂
i do
Yes
Congrats
Awesome but is this a crypto kitty ?! 
*narrows eyes at OP after seeing -31 downvotes in RES and post history*
Amen to that. BCH could be $100,000 or $0.10 and its usability, simplicity, and security as a currency would be the exact same.

That's true, bro. Too bad the banks are laughing right now because the coin that supposedly designed to kill them has just turned into a harmless store of value. Now instead of a threat, the once-proud coin is now in harmony and dancing side-by-side with the central banks.
No, you can essentially only replace by fee if there aren't any confirmations, that's why we were discussing zero conf transactions 
Damn awesome lol

And to that extent, Ripple has proved to be a reliable asset with real-world utility. It is gaining **adoption** at an unprecedented rate.
Great to see more adoption.
"Awesome but does this lower transaction fees and speeds or increases it? If the latter is the answer then sell asap. You know what the asnwer is.
