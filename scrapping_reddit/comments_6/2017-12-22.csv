I honestly don't get why a bigger block makes it more vulnerable, is the encryption method not scalable with block size?
"https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block_size_limit_controversy

""No amount of max block size would support all the world's future transactions on the main blockchain (various types of off-chain transactions are the only long-term solution)""

For a coin to be used world wide, some off chain method is needed to reduce the load on the main blockchain. Bch has no intention of implementing solutions like segwit or LN(or others). It's a short term solution in which roger ver wants to make as much money as possible.

I quote him: ""inside trading is a non-crime""

And btw, more than 50% of miners are already in China because of the power needed to mine the large blocks. Already starts to centralize... what if China raids mining centers?

Oh yes I've lost this argument because your calling me a retard? LOL. 
Ehm... no. You are a retard because of what I already told you. And you lost this argument because of what I already told you.
I was thinking about the same. Someone should build a smart contract which securely transfers Bitcoin private keys for money, as the transaction fee is higher than balances in many wallets.

"Instant off-chain txs are coming to BTC in the form of the lightning network. I assume it's going to be easy to fit it into any Bitcoin forks. If you studied data structs, you're going to love the lightning network white paper.

Sidechains though are a little bit more complicated...

The LN is already running on BTC's testnet. You can test for yourself buying digital coffees with tBTC (testnet coins)."
No need to be sorry, newbie! And welcome also. So great to see so many people who are obviously new to crypto getting interested in talking here about the real Bitcoin. But you too need to do some research into the proper terms, to avoid embarrassing yourself. Always be learning.
No, 'lightning' is currently *nothing* other than a concept, and it most likely will never be anything.
"Possibly, but the practical part of how that would work is still unproven. In the event that you want to send BTC to your friend you would still have to put a transaction on the block chain so your not getting rid of that. 

It's benefit seems to be for situations where you do a lot of transactions with someone. Something I'm still a little confused about how logistically it'll really work or if it is even feasible because the act of opening up a payment channel ties up my funds. So I obviously wouldn't want to put more on the payment channel than for that one purchase. Even in situations where I know I will be paying someone frequently. Say a yearly subscription I pay monthly for. I wouldn't want to deposit the full year's cost in the payment channel and release the funds every month. If I wanted to lose those funds for a year I would have just paid for the year in advance.

You can verify it’s real. But until you send it to a new address that only you control, you can’t be certain that the seller won’t spend them. Meaning that you need to absorb a transaction fee one way or the other. 
Lower the fees. Then we talk again. Even the fact that fees could be as high as a weeks worth of labor would've been unthinkable and a huge flaw in the bitcoin technology. 
"What would you call a coin that costs $30 to move, takes days to confirm and is completely unreliable?  

It's the fact blockstream let the network burn down so they could sell their patented vaporware on it instead of changing a simple variable on a line of code that is so frustrating.  Then censored the shit out of key points of discussion and acted like sanctimonious cunts about it.  Like honestly fuck that 

Good news is we have clearly defined roles now.  BCH is onchain scaling for the transactional currency of the future and BTC is offchain giftcard p2p beanie baby system.  "

"unless you're spending the whole thing and don't reuse the keypair

edit: i'm guessing exposing a private key from a deterministic wallet doesn't leak info about subsequent keys"
That's the only problem essentially, maybe it could be solved if it's a multi-signature wallet being sent so someone holds all the keys somehow. Or sending hardware wallets (that can't be exported, which is its own problem... this is actually kinda difficult).
I mean, isn't that basically what Lightning is? A way to conduct transactions off-chain in order to avoid the higher fees associated with on-chain transactions?
It's another acronym. Seems people didn't get it...
"Networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum are “blockchains”, which you could also call a “distributed ledger”. Think of a distributed ledger as basically an Excel accounting spreadsheet full of balances and transactions, and _verified by other people_ (the miners) to make sure that nobody is cheating the system.

Bitcoin is like an Excel spreadsheet; Ethereum also is an Excel spreadsheet, but with macros (with applications, “smart contracts” built in that distributed spreadsheet; these macros/smart contracts add additional functionality to your spreadsheet)."

"This is also a concept .. so yes.  Just like lightning!
"
"I haven't really looked too deeply into the technical details of Lightning, but I believe the idea isn't necessarily that you open a payment channel directly with the person you're transacting with. Rather, the Lightning network is supposed to be a _network_ that lets you route payments through third parties.

So for example: If you have a channel open with ""ACME Bitcoin Exchange"", and that exchange has a channel open with ""Cryptocurrency Exchange Foo"", and your friend you're trying to send money to has a channel open with ""Cryptocurrency Exchange Foo"", then you can send money to your friend by routing the payment through ""ACME Bitcoin Exchange"" and ""Cryptocurrency Exchange Foo""."
You can mine ether at home using decent graphics cards. It's not as profitable as it was but it's still doable. You need ASICS to mine bitcoin effectively. Ethereum will be moving to Proof of stake rather than proof of work in the near future.
"Yes, when you interact with a specific application’s smart contract (the EtherDelta exchange, Etheroll.com’s lottery, CryptoKitties, etc.), when you want to make a transaction (bet on some number, withdraw your funds, etc.), you pay transaction fees to run these applications.

These transaction fees are decoupled from any value you want to send (i.e. when you interact with a smart contract, you typically pay 0 ETH, but you pay something like 0.0000021 ETH as transaction fees to run the application)."
The problem doesn't stem from the BTC technology.  It stems from the people who are successfully driving BTC into the ground, especially Blockstream's Chief (idiotic) Technical Officer, Gregory Maxwell.

"'lightning' is not 'running' in any meaningful way, anywhere.  The fact that you can manually open some payment channels on testnet (or even mainnet) is meaningless.  'Lightning' doesn't become a real payment solution until there are many, many hubs and multi-hop routing has been solved.  (i.e., probably never).  See some of /u/jstolfi's comments for more details.

>Neither is the previous commenter's hypothetical ""easy-to-use dapp for low cost bitcoin transactions"".

that's even dumber, why would you create a dapp to do bitcoin transactions on Ethereum rather than just using Ether?"
"I get the routing part. It's the locking up of funds that doesn't seem feasible. The exchange will need to know how much money you plan on receiving and they will have to put that much money or more into the payment channel so they can transfer the money. That money is now locked up for the exchange and they can't use it for other customers. Even if no one ever sends you money the exchange can't use those coins. 

This means two things. Only the richest of people will be able to run exchanges in order to be able to support it's customers. Which means your going to get some serious centralization. 

The other issue is how are you and the exchange going to decide how much money the exchange put's into the channel. If you receive a lot of transactions then obviously you want to have the highest amount possible so you don't have to keep opening channels which cost more money. But if your the exchange you want the lowest amount possible because you don't want unnecessary funds tied up that could be better used on other customer transactions. 

I think what is going to happen is you will have a song and dance take place for anyone that wants to be able to receive any amount of money that will make the LN worth it. Because it'll take a lot of capitals to host a productive exchange only a very few will exist. This will be counterproductive to the distributed idea and allow the large exchanges to take advantage of people.

I envision the whole thing becoming highly centralized with that move. Think of the benefits you can get if you treat the exchanges as banks. You deposit all your money into their account. Now they just tell you how much money you have. They hold LN channels with tons of other exchange banks and transfer funds all over the place. Because they are large and hold a lot of money together they can create LN channels with an insane amount of funds. And also because hopefully they send close to equal amount of money back and forth those channels won't run out of money quickly like a one sided channel will. Transferring all of my coins to a exchange bank means I don't have to incur the cost of opening a LN channel or worry about deciding the amount of funds needed on both sides. "

"But you'd transfer it out of the ""transfer account"" immediately, so does it really matter?"
It is in the sense that nobody can see that value was transfered. Obviously the recipient must trust that the sender does not retain a copy of the private key so it is not a suitable solution for most applications.

"In theory, yes.  In practice theres a reasonable upper limit for the number of transactions humankind expects to make.   It might entirely be possible that all of human commerce fits in 256mb blocks (especially with segwit). 

A good analogy is that doubling a road width only increases the number 9f cars by a constant, and you might need to double it again, but its still a better solution to do that than it is to just have one continuous traffic jam and no cars for 40 years while hoping eventually everyone buys a boat to travel on the congestion-free open ocean.   

"
"The cryptos using graphs instead of linked lists are not going to go through these scaling problems (e.g., IOTA, Factom).

To remedy scaling on Bitcoin, a bigger block or a shorter interval in between blocks could be implemented (theoretically), however that would only allow for a constant increase in the amount of transactions per second (throughput).

What we really need are off-chain transactions, sidechains and perhaps even sharding (to allow for those big-ass blocks).

Ethereum's ""CEO"" (xD) made a great blog post on this subject a few days ago.

Edit: graphs as in directed acyclic graphs and linked lists as in blockchains."

"I think there's still a big lingering question which is an issue of trust. Not just trust in the dev team, resilience of the cryptocurrency or technical merits, but trust in the *value* of the coin itself.

If we switch to a better coin every time some new exciting tech comes out, do we switch immediately? Without a way to peg the values, that means existing holders will lose out to people who bought the new coins first. It leads to a lot of uncertainty in the market, and also devalues the currency as a means of store-of-value. Your general average Joe definitely doesn't want to have to research new tech every 6 months and re-evaluate if he/she needs to liquidates the entire crypto savings for a new coin.

You could argue it's still early enough that we should experiment and try out new coins before we settle on longer term stability, which is fair, but at least this is why Bitcoin Cash has something different from the other non-BTC coins: it was a fork and traces back the value from the original chain. Original BTC owners still has BCH."
While I do agree that there are some that do it better, Bitcoin (Core) has clearly demonstrated the absolutely fucking *massive* utility of first-mover advantage and Bitcoin Gold has clearly demonstrated the absolutely fucking *massive* utility of name/brand recognition. Even if there are better coins out there, Bitcoin Cash inherently has a big leg up against the competition. I'm not saying throw everything you have into BCH but I think in this market dominated by hype and irrational exuberance you'd be missing out if you didn't at least pick up some. Actual functionality is clearly if not an afterthought then at the very least it's not the primary concern for most people at this point in time.

It's not that centralization is not bad, it's just that centralization is the unavoidable end-game for crypto as mining becomes more expensive and sophisticated. It doesnt meant anything to just say centralization is bad. You have to analyze what level of centralization is detrimental to the security of the network. Without that analysis I consider it FUD.

There's good tech, and then there's good tech at the right place at the right time.

">And what's the plan once 8mb blocks are full? 

BCH already allows up to 32mb blocks. When 8mb is full nodes will start broadcasting larger blocks."
"It doesn't have a dev who liquidated all of holdings once price jumped for one.

Plan once 8mb blocks are letting it grow and let the market (miners) decide how big it should get. Miners are the ones who deal with all the data anyway."
"Litecoin is not faster than BCH. LTC has 1mb blocks with 2.5 minute block times. BCH has 8mb block with 10 minute block time. So BCH has twice the throughput of LTC.

BCH also supports 0 confirmation transactions which means small transactions can be trusted instantly. LTC has replace by fee so you can't do 0 confirmation transactions.

There are other coins that are faster than BCH but LTC is not one of them. Those coins don't have the same level of adoption as BCH though. 

BCH is a good balance of usefulness and adoption. It's faster than BTC and has lower fees while having the ability for all BTC infrastructure to be easily switched over to BCH. So exchanges, ATMs, wallets, credit cards, miners, and nodes can all add support for BCH really quickly. And since it is a fork of BTC is already has a large user base. This is ultimately what puts BCH ahead of all the other alts out there that are faster. 

Additionally you only need enough speed to handle the network. Anything past that is great for the future but presently unnecessary for operation. BCH is fast enough to operate without issue and comes with all the users and adoption of BTC"
"the plan at 8mb - why wouldn't it just to be a fork and an increase in block size?  seems simple enough until people made it not simple.   

And please, I'll pre-emptively mention this, no it's not going to get ""so big"" that it becomes centralized.  this constant arguement ignores that progress exists.  it ignores that we are staking things on technology that is 10 years old already.  Sandisk is about to come out with a 512 gb SD card -- 5 years ago, no one even had that kind of storage at any size, now  - it's the size of a thumbnail.   this whole ""blockchain gets to big"" arguement is insane.   

so I say again, increase the blocksize.  if the fork is contensious then, that's what it was supposed to be because it's based on decentralized consensus.    

while all the no2x nonsense was going on - quietly ethereum hard forked.   notice the world didn't fall apart for them.  consensus works if people let it.  "
"> itecoin is even faster will the 2 minute blocks. And what's the plan once 8mb blocks are full? It seems like it has all the same pending issues as Bitcoin / every blockchain currency

The BCH roadmap says there will be a size increase in the next upgrade and a move towards adaptive block size.

https://www.bitcoinabc.org/bitcoin-abc-medium-term-development"
"Aside from what everyone else said, I want to address a specific point that doesn't get addressed much:

> Litecoin is even faster will the 2 minute blocks. 

This doesn't matter. There are two measurements we care about:

1. Security of a transaction per period of time (often expressed as time to some amount of confirmation)
2. Number of transactions per period of time

Having faster blocks doesn't affect either of these on its own. For example, let's say we have an imaginary coin where have ten 1MB blocks per minute, or another coin with one 10MB block per minute, and it would be equivalent. You fit in the same amount of transactions per minute, and you get the same amount of mining security per minute (because to get ten blocks per minute, you're reducing the mining difficulty by 1/10).

There _are_ things you can do to get faster block times _and_ better security ([for example](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/07/11/toward-a-12-second-block-time/)), but Litecoin is not doing anything there to my knowledge."
Litecoin is going to hit the same problems that BTC already has, just later because it has 4x the throughput. Charlie Lee is a smallblocker and believes that L2 scaling solutions can work, which means that LTC is inevitably going to turn into a fee market as soon as enough people start using it.
Litecoin doesn't want to be better than Bitcoin it only wants to be second best
"I’m no expert but I think privacy goes a little deeper than coin source. The amount you hold in your wallet will still be public and your IP address will still be sent to the network, which would be solved by Kovri.

I think it’s still a nice feature to have but it won’t replace privacy focussed coins as they cater to different markets."
"MOnero
s a cool idea but it has scaling issues too"
"What do you think about trustless tumbling services for BCH, like CashShuffle?

I see Bitcoin Cash more as a (functional) base layer. If you need full privacy there can be solutions built on top of it, like CashShuffle did."

"Charlie Lee is a ""cash out your chips"" and let them fall where they may (assuming that's ATH)."
"Does L2 stand for level 2 aka non blockchain? Sorry I haven’t see that term before.

How does Ethereum handle similar problems? "
how does this promote decentralization if the block sizes are so big consumer-level hardware can't run a full node?
Oops meant to post to a different comment
"Okay this whole nonsense with Charlie is just fucking stupid at this point. I can see the 8mb growing I can agree with that. But can we just cut out the bullshit related to Charlie? We’re better than that.

The guy can’t win. He holds we shit on him, he doesn’t hold we shit on him. The guy donated his litecoins to the litecoin foundation. I actually respect him for being transparent, we can twist the narrtive all we want, but he did warn his followers several days back a big correction will happen, and it did. He understand the cryptospace a lot more than we do.

You guys ragged on him for hyping when he held coin. So now you rag on him because he doesn't hold coins? 
"Monero is fine for truly private tx, but you have to pay for it via larger tx costs as typical tx is 50 times larger than bitcoin. That won't scale for global adoption unless users are willing pay premium for it.

"The differences of opinion in the different subs just astounds me. I really have no dog in this fight (well, roughly the same number of virtual dogs in each fight anyways)

Yes, level 2 is anything off-chain. I'm not really involved in the Ethereum community, but they have already fixed some short-term scaling issues (e.g. Cryptokitties) by just raising the gas limit (i.e. effective blocksize).

"Thanks for proving my point. 

Just saying it gets old after a while. I'm trying to give both sides a fair shot, and it just comes off as immature. "
Most important news eventually shows up on /r/buttcoin even if it's just to poke fun at it.
">  if the block sizes are so big consumer-level hardware can't run a full node?

Consumer level hardware can run full nodes just fine. Also a currency you can actually use without spending $50 on fees is more important than running a full node on a raspberry pi."
They asked what the plan was once 8mb blocks are full. I linked to the plan.
"Honestly speaking, I really like Monero (tech and team). Of the opinion that for anything to take off it needs to be *truly* private. I like the thought of public blockchain for public-level transactions; government contracts etc but I wouldn't want a 3rd party block chain analysis company being able to link my real ID against purchases on PornHub or Amazon.

Public blockchain excites me as a form of permanent public ledger, but less so as a currency.

In terms of public-based blockchain projects I lean towards Vert and Lite since they both seem to care about their utility as a currency (as does Bitcoin Cash) but I'm less religious about LN."
Concern trolling, mate.

I'm not implying any more than that."
"It's a ridiculous argument. If Bitcoin is still widely used when the block reward is tiny, even a tiny block reward will be a serious fucking hunk of cash awarded every 10 minutes.

Virtue signalling is the conspicuous expression of moral values done primarily with the intent of enhancing standing within a social group. The term was first used in signalling theory, to describe any behavior that could be used to signal virtue—especially piety among the religious. In recent years, the term has become more commonly used as a pejorative characterization by commentators to criticize what they regard as empty, or superficial support of certain political views, and also used within groups to criticize their own members for valuing outward appearance over substantive action.

The same reason we like bch is why btc concerns us...it has moved so far from it's origin and most of the people here were btc supporters until it was basterdized.
Do I really need to state the obvious fact that BTC impacts the whole market?
Yeah, I read that too, until the cats episode.  And then I asked about this and that and the community there is just, weird.

I'm happy the fork occurred. I'm not thrilled with co-opting the Bitcoin name. 
Isn't that a bit rich, given how almost every post on BTC vilifies BTC and pumps BCH? 
"Keep in mind, the 19-man subreddit hit team there (aka ""the moderators"") are all Blockstream lackeys. They ban, erase and censor literally every discussion that has something to do with how broken BTC is. The people running the great firewall of China look at that sub with awe and go ""damn, those guys know how to censor."""
"Agreed. But that applies to my main point. OP was complaining about the nonsense in r/Bitcoin. I was just trying to show that it happens on both sides. 

People will be people no matter what. 

Edit: glad we could have a reasonable discussion. "
LOL - read the comments, the last of us that can still post there are letting him have it.
"That's your opinion and clearly the majority disagree. You don't get to decide which is ""king currency"". "
The big tell for me is that neither the whitepaper nor Satoshi are mentioned in the sidebar. On /r/btc, it's in the header graphic AND the sidebar. +1 for you guys <3
"The decentralized approach of BCH simply demands more knowledge and involvement. But a lot of people are lazy and thus outsource their brain to Blockstream..

As a result those folks that prefer a centralized coin like BTC don't value technical discussion. In the end it wouldn't make sense anyway since all important decisions are made between Greg and Adam.
"
">When did the whole Bitcoin commulity become so greedy and obsessed with who can horde the most coins and pat itself on the back about never using the things.

The former has been true for a long time now. The back patting is a more recent development, mostly because they don't have a good retort for complaints about its broken utility."
People need to realize its not one crypto vs another but rather the entirety of the technology that needs to be accepted and this one or the other mentality only slows the acceptance overall of this new tech. 
I wanna go back to spending internet points! In fact, I never stopped until fees got completely ridiculous the last few weeks. BitPay adding BCH is bullish for me being able to spend internet points again!
"Read the censorship of r/bitcoin

So much for censorship-resistance.

Do as I say, not as I do."
"Well the tribal nonsense is unavoidable sometimes, but there's plenty of pro-BCH stuff to be found here that makes no explicit reference to BTC. 

But it can also be difficult to be pro anything without being anti something else - pro and anti are deeply related concepts, and often only make sense in terms of each other.

You just have to filter out the noise, turn up your BS detector, and hone in on the facts and pertinent data to draw your own informed conclusions about the space/market."
"I'm happy we have BCH :) BTC doesn't keep me up at night anymore worrying about unconfirmed transactions.

Oh we are happy. Just aren't going to let btc claim to be king currency when it's fundamentally broken.

i also hold neither at this stage, though briefly held btc based on nothing more than believing the speculation hype would drive prices, which it did.  
  
BTC is broken and has been passed by. BCH appears, by all indicators, to be wildly better, in that it is actually functional.  
  
But it is so entrenched in a petty fight, I don't want the risk of the brand, nor the inclination of participating in the community.   
  
Neither are all about the tech anymore, but at least BCH is somewhat.

I just got banned from r/bitcoin for talking about raising the block size. I guess I didn't believe the censorship was so bad until now, but that explains the total lack of discussion on fundamentals.
"It is if you already got your way, but continue to harp on something that you've moved on from. 

You can talk about economic realities without devolving to name calling and acting childish. 

Btc users are aware of the problems and are working towards fixing that. You can't release untested code on a network this big. There's a lot of money at stake.

/u/tippr $1 =)
I get that. But not everyone is a civilized as you about it. At times it seems more like an anti btc sub than a pro bch sub. 
">0 of them are about the ever decreasing utility of bitcoin as a currency and/or mempool issues

Everyone is aware of the issue. There is no need to have discussion about it every day of the week. It's all been said and acknowledged already. 

Things are being developed that *could* correct the issue. Whether you believe in that or not is up to you.

I personally would rather have high tx fees for a while as opposed to centralising the network with block size increases that start out small but will gradually push out all the nodes from the network. "

50 of 50 r/btc post are how shitty bitcoin is. these both subreddit suck. both are immature people.
What do you support as a peer-to-peer worldwide payment network?
"WTF is HODL?

HODLing is greed.  It's quite literally telling someone to not sell their Bitcoin so that the value doesn't crash and leave you broke.  In the 4 years I have been using Bitcoin, I have NEVER once cashed out Bitcoin for fiat.  I spent all that I had and bought more.

Well, I can't spend it any more.  So I took the small amount I had left, and I cashed it out to USD on Saturday.  First time in 4 years I have ever even thought of doing that.

People may not like Bitcoin Cash, but at least they can afford to spend it.  I bought USD$25 yesterday of BCH.  Hopefully I will be able to spend it soon."
This subreddit is not much better, filled to the brim with Roger Ver sycophants and now the same kind of shitty memes in the front page. But it's always nice to see both sides of the issue, no matter how right/wrong and fanatical they can be.

"I think both BTC and Bitcoin kinda suck. Don't get me wrong there's some great people here but it's gotten so divisive, were all on the same team team crypto, we shoudl be forwarding crypto as opposed to fighting each other.

As Andreas said, there is no true Bitcoin, the true Bitcoin is what you feel the true Bitcoin is, which one the market values is secondary, though obviously it is important money wise as that determines what it's worth. 

I personally can't stand Ver, his CNBC interview rather than talking about the positive elements of Bitcoin Cash he wasted his time just whining about and trashing Bitcoin Core. 

Meme's are stupid, provide no value and are way overdone. People are gonna talk about price, it's important to people and it's how we wrap our head around it so I don't really care for all these on my high horse talking about how I don't care about value posts either. "

Agreed, for the most part. The utility and practical use of bitcoin is seriously overhyped in that sub. 
"> When did the whole Bitcoin commulity become so greedy and obsessed with who can horde the most coins and pat itself on the back about never using the things.

Censorship and narrative engineering did what they're supposed to. It also created a creating sucking noise draining all the brains out of those who remained. Nevertheless, hodling is not an illegitimate practice, it's a necessity. All coins in existence belong to somebody at all times, they don't vanish into the ether once you've used/sold them."
"Censorship.  The reason killer.
"
I'm curious as to why you are not a fan of Bitcoin Cash. It would be good to get that view from someone who seems to be able to see a little bit of the other side.
I don't understand why you dislike Bitcoin Cash (though of course there are other _very_ competent altcoins as well!), but otherwise I agree with every single thing you wrote. I also happen to love your username :-D
"Are you a fan of Bitcoin?

You'll fit in here.

Also, call it Blockstream Core. It's their implementation of Bitcoin now. They broke it. Let them have it."
"Yours is the very best post from a non BCH supporter I’ve read in a very long time.

Personally I prefer BCH but simply because it’s a bit closer to what BTC should be. If BTC devs stopped caring so much about the price and their so called store of value and they turned Bitcoin Core into an usable coin, I’d definitely buy again."
/u/tippr $1 how does this thing work? What is it?
Just the other day I saw a post about how the mempool was clear.
A lot of currencies have groups like this, though. That doesn't mean the coin is dead, it just means the groups are toxic. Let's turn this sub into one that talks about btc (and all the forks of it) in terms of their techn. Let's use it to educate people. That would be better than complaining about the other guys. It would also help pull new people in.

That's because people that know what they are doing, are using segwit.
"Yet the front page of this sub is more than 75% posts talking about Bitcoin 🙄

Funny you say that. I tried subbing here but it seems every post is just trying to discredit btc. 
"Bitcoin cash scandal sent waves to news now ppl think twice before investing in crypto thinking it's a scamm like bch.l cuz on the news veer said it. 

I liked bch but not anymore. It is used to damage all cryptos"
I *would* say that there is probably a little bit too much of a focus on BTC and /r/btc in this sub, though. The more we focus on BCH and making it better, the sooner that BTC can be surpassed. If you want to beat Bitcoin Core you'll have to stay focused on the tasks at hand.
Censorship filters good discussion out.
"Pointing out the economic realities of the Bitcoin Core network isn't ""bashing"" it. "
There's other currencies I feel do a better job than Bitcoin and even Bitcoin Cash but I don't judge anyone for making the switch. I hope you get rewarded for it.
At this point, switch to ANYTHING else.  It's impossible to USE Bitcoin at this point, and it seems there are no plans to fix that.
You switch coins based on how you like some subreddits?
"> When did the whole Bitcoin commulity become so greedy and obsessed with who can horde the most coins [...]

It didn't. Most of the bitcoin community moved over to bitcoin cash/ethereum or other currencies when the bitcoin project was hijacked. What you see in r/bitcoin nowadays is mostly new ""users"" (speculators) with no real interest in bitcoin other than the price..."
"I think a large part of the hesitation to go to Bitcoin Cash is the air around Ver himself. I didn't really know anything about Bitcoin Cash until the video of him flipping shit and bragging about being richer than Andreas went viral. I think Bitcoin Cash would be viewed much better by the masses if Roger wasn't so 'elitist' (probably not the right word, but close enough)

Bitcoin Cash has far more current and future usability, I think the actual use-case for the Lightning Network is far less than what is being said about it, and at this point, even if Segwit suddenly became 100% adopted it still wouldn't clear the mempool. And considering everyone keeps saying this is 'only the beginning' for crypto adoption, the backlog will only get worse.

I'm not saying Roger is all bad or anything, but goddamn does he come off as an asshole sometimes lol"
"I don't have a side - I think crypto tribalism is infantile and stupid. But in terms of the BCH vs. BTC debate, how do we speak of the merits of one of them without reference to the other? 

For example, one of the merits of BCH is its ability to be used as a transactional currency - using BCH, you can send money to anyone in the world very quickly and very cheaply. 

Why is that considered a merit? Because you can't do that with BTC."
No the point is satoshi designed it to work as a currency for everyone and btc was changed to completely not function unless you pay fees higher than 4.2 billion people in the world make monthly.
This. 
"Is there a mechanism to prevent source code hijacking in Bitcoin Cash?  That is, a problem with Bitcoin is that most of the control rests on the person that controls Bitcoin Core software.  There could be competitors, but sites like bitcoin.com and bitcoin.org are the gateways for most people interested in getting started.  What is to prevent the abuse of power by those controlling those sites or by people that control the most popular software?  I do not see a solution for this.
"
The reasons you list are exactly why I switched to bitcoin cash. 
As an aside when I look here I see news about Nicehash resuming operations, scaling discussion, mempool critique. I wish there as was a little less BCH shilling of course but at least you guys give a shit.

Tbh this sub shows a similar kind of behavior sometimes. With satoshis vision and all. Everyone needs to just stop being so emotional about it.. 
"99% of all crypto speculators don't understand that.

**Speculation.**

 A lot of people think, “Speculation? Oh, that’s gambling.” Well, actually no. Speculation is allocating capital not to create more capital, but to take advantage of distortions and misallocations created in the market—usually by government interference. Gambling is to engage in a game of chance—roulette, dice, or the like. Since most people in the markets have no idea what they’re doing, they actually are gambling—just using their brokerage house as a casino. Perhaps that’s why people conflate the two things.

**Investment. Savings.**

Everybody uses these words, often interchangeably. But nobody ever defines them, because they don’t understand what they actually mean. So, they’re misused and conflated. What is investment? “Investment” is the allocation of a certain amount of capital to a productive enterprise, intended to create more capital. It’s like planting a seed. “Savings” is simply putting aside the fruits of past production. You should produce more than you consume. When you set aside the excess, that is savings. Saving creates capital, and with capital, you can invest. But now, the concepts of savings and investment are conflated. The difference between them is undefined and therefore uncertain in the public’s mind.

Any reasonable discussion is censored, it's not that there wasn't reasonable discussion a few years ago, there was. It just gets deleted now and all the intelligent people left. All that's left now are idiots and newbies.
"Every time there is a negative price fluctuation, it's always ""Roger Ver and his shitcoin"" that is the cause of all the problem."
"It is really amazing that such bullshit gets to the top over there.

Bitcoin Cash is down more than Bitcoin in this crash, yet somehow it was all planned by Roger et al."
Reminds me of T_D
Agree. Everyone likes the occasional meme or shitpost, but the noise-to-content ratio is too damn high.
This mailing list should be stickied to their fucking front page for everyone to see: https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2017-December/015459.html
3 years of intense censorship and banning anyone that dare  Go against the official agenda..
Fuck the 40 dollar fees. That is not the system I invested in in 2012. I am beyond outraged at this point.
The Bitcoin community got censored and left r/Bitcoin. The only people left there are mostly noobs who don't know any better or people willing to accept censorship which should tell you everything about their character. And shills. That's why it has become so immature. The functional adults left.
Only on that other sub is people trying to transact with their currency an attack. 
I agree that is utterly retarded but let's not pretend people in here aren't just as ridiculous with their conspiracies.
Post this over there and get banned then stop wasting your time there.
ok but you are using the logical fallacy of a personal attack. so what is it about bcash that makes it the darkside?
"No, only Bitcoin XT supports both.

Bitcoin Unlimited uses xthin.

Bitcoin core, and I believe Bitcoin ABC uses compact blocks

You gain more than saving half the bandwidth. By uploading  ~50kB instead of 1MB (when a block is found), it makes mining more feasible on a home connection (with a limited upload speed).
"
"I am aware, It is not like I have the hash-power to truly worry about it.

With token hash-power, any orphan rate below 5% is acceptable.
"
"Ok, so then it's 8x worse for Bitcoin Cash.

64MB/~0.5MB/s -> ~128 seconds

That leads to an orphan rate of ~21.3%

For 200kB of hashes: 1600kB/~500kB/s -> 3.2 seconds

That leads to an orphan rate of ~0.53%, 5x that of Bitcoin."
">How do you think bitcoin works? What will these impotent nodes do when they see ""foul play""? Call the police?

They ignore those blocks and disconnect from the node that sent them the block, which depending on how important those nodes are (exchanges, shops, etc) means that the chain with the invalid block becomes instantly worthless.

>They do not determine the validity of a block. 

The rules determine the validity, nodes verify that the blocks don't break the rules. 

>Only miners do that.

Validating a block isn't even needed to mine a block on top of it. Some miners have even publicly admitted that they don't verify blocks before starting to mine on top of them, to gain a time advantage. The real usefulness of miners is to choose an ordering for transactions and make the chain immutable. 

>Non-mining nodes literally do nothing for security of the network.

They make the network more resistant to DDOS for one, along with a few other benefits like the ones I'm claiming above.

>They *can* secure your individual transactions

Which for a business is quite important. 

>SPV wallets have the exact same security implications, and can be run without the storage overhead.

SPV wallets will gladly follow a block with invalid transactions on it as long as they're not your own. This means following a block that will be discarded. 

>Anyone at a university spending money on undermining bitcoin would be better off spending money for honest mining.

You haven't thought this through, how long do you think this person would have unnoticed access to those machines? They don't own the machines, so they can't just keep mining for days or weeks. 

Their best bet would be to do the attack one night and make a huge double spend.

>As I have said before, it did not have widespread adoption. People bought small things with it. Socks, hard drives, pizza, etc. It was a currency from the very beginning.

Do you have any source for that? Because as far as I know the pizza was one of the first purchases and it was in 2010, nearly a year later. 

>The title of the white paper is pretty specific on this point

Yes, it was meant to be a currency but it was worthless in the first months, so I don't see how it was more than experimentation by technical people at that point. "
I use it, what can you do with Bcash? I know of no merchants that take it.
"For the same reason that miners do not all agree to inflate the currency. It undermines the currency, so they would be attacking the very thing that they have been paying the power bills for.

Consider this, why has this not happened? There was a time when spv and full non-mining nodes weren't a thing. At this point in time, why did bitcoin survive? Game theory. It is the essential economic innovation of bitcoin."
"> They decrease the reliance on miners and increase the chances that foul play will be caught.

How do you think bitcoin works? What will these impotent nodes do when they see ""foul play""? Call the police? They do not determine the validity of a block. Only miners do that. Non-mining nodes literally do nothing for security of the network. They *can* secure your individual transactions, but SPV wallets have the exact same security implications, and can be run without the storage overhead.


> The reason it didn't happen is certainly not because of game theory.

Yes, it actually is. Read the white paper again, even more carefully. The game theoretical innovation is crucial. Anyone at a university spending money on undermining bitcoin would be better off spending money for honest mining. This is the key principle in the game theory that you seem to miss. It is essential in understanding the incentives that secure the bitcoin blockchain.

> All that I've seen about the history of it says otherwise, who was using it as a currency in the first few months, and how/for what?

As I have said before, it did not have widespread adoption. People bought small things with it. Socks, hard drives, pizza, etc. It was a currency from the very beginning. The title of the white paper is pretty specific on this point, and people used it in this way from the beginning."
It doesn't sound reasonable because you haven't explained your thinking very well with the English language. 
I was assuming 1MB blocks for those calculation. Typically you have at least 8 peers.
Doesn't matter that it's a minority chain. EDA means it's trading blows with BTC for profitability, and current hash rate is north of 2 exahashes/second compared to roughly 15 on the BTC chain. That's not massively minor, just minor.
Whoever said that non crypto enterprises would operate high volume hubs? Though i can think of a fair few that it would benefit, but anyway....
"Why does he say that a .5 mb connection could propagate a 1 gig block in 10 minutes.  [the math makes no sense](https://youtu.be/5SJm2ep3X_M?t=660)

Even taking 5 minutes to propagate a block is pretty bad because you'll run into situation where you get 2 or 3 blocks back to back and then you'll instantly be backlogged until you get a longer period of time between blocks. "
ok so you reasoning is limited to personal attacks. good for you.
"Please reference the zec bug with a link, I'd like to know about it.

It did not have far reaching adoption, but you can rest assured, people have been trying to undermine it and prove it's game theoretical innovations wrong ever since. They have failed. They will continue to fail. Read the white paper. If you have already, read it again. It is worth reading several times."

Btw, would it make sense for the initial sync to work backwards from checkpoints instead of forwards from genesis?"
"That has nothing to do with how much bandwidth is used, but you make a good point.

"No, I just don't think that for a serious business, the cost of running a machine comparable to a decent sized web server amounts to a hill of beans. I've worked places that have coffee service that's more expensive than the cost of running a full node. You exhibit a tremendous amount of naivety when you think that these tiny sums are in some way an impediment for a business that depends on the blockchain for some mission critical purpose.

There has never been any social contract that suggests that people or businesses of X income will always be able to afford to validate the world's transactions. Such a contract would be counterproductive. All manner of Bitcoin users cannot and have never been able to validate the world's transactions. The notion that they should need to is absurd. I reject it wholly. It's a mischaracterization of Bitcoin's intended architecture."
"Imagine you want to send 8 copies of a 1MB block to peers (assuming 5Mbps upload):

8MB/~0.5MB/s -> ~16 seconds

For 50kB of hashes:
400kB/~500kB/s -> 800ms

That leads to an orphan rate of ~0.13%.

Disk latency due to inadequate RAM would probably have a larger effect. Edit: The overall point is that you do not have to be in a datacenter to win the block race."
">Please reference the zec bug with a link, I'd like to know about it.

I misremembered it, it was with Zcoin, which is very similar to Zcash. Just google ""Zcoin supply bug"" and you'll get a bunch of articles.

>Thousands of full nodes do nothing to secure the network.

They decrease the reliance on miners and increase the chances that foul play will be caught. Right now the exchanges run their own nodes so they can't be fooled but imagine if nodes became so expensive to run that they decided to outsource it to another company. You would have a central point of failure from which you'd be able to attack them all at once. That company could also be owned by miners or receive a cut of Satoshi's coins to keep quiet.

>Bitcoin does not require ""morals"".

In the beginning anyone with access to a large amount of GPU's, maybe someone on a University, could have attacked it while everyone was still mining for fun on CPU's. The reason it didn't happen is certainly not because of game theory.

>It was never a ""hobby for very nerdy people"". If that's how it was introduced to you, I'm sorry that you were misinformed. It has been a currency from day one.

Because right now there are thousands of full nodes verifying every single block, this would be noticed within hours by individuals.

I said pruned, pretty loudly actually. Prune growth is about 10GB per 7 years per MB/block

"> You gain more than saving half the bandwidth. By uploading ~50kB instead of 1MB (when a block is found)

Huh? Instead of relaying 8 MB of transactions **and** an 8 MB block (including transactions), you only relay 8 MB of transactions + block header + hashes. How is that a saving of *more* than half?"
"They always use coffee as the example.   Will the coffee shop tie up funds hoping people transaction with this magical money?

You just have to come up with that $5 on your own.  Yes, we know you already paid us $5 to open the channel at the beginning of the month, but this is different.

"Yeah, it's a bot someone set up that you can use to tip people on reddit and twitter. Check out [the wiki](https://np.reddit.com/r/tippr/wiki/index) for more info. If you get tipped, you can withdraw it into your wallet or use it to tip others. You can also send money to the tipbot to fill your balance so you can use it to tip others.

Bitcoin used to have a tipbot too but it has become infeasible because of the ridiculous fees. Mentioning the BCH tipbot in /r/bitcoin will get you censored though because Core doesn't want their users to know that BCH is actually a usable currency. I posted a comment about it once and it didn't appear when logged out, only when logged in, lol."
To validate a block you have to have validated all blocks that have come before, but I feel like it's totally possible to prune old blocks once the chain is validated (I don't think any implementation of this has been done though?)
I don't see how, would any miner be better off if he didn't take the cut? I suspect that this scheme would fail not because of game theory but because a miner with morals would blow the whistle. 
If you don't want any shitcoins why you keeping BTC? I have no BTC, why the fuck should I keep that shit that is unusable? You already lowered your team's IQ.
"Thanks for your concern and this guide, but unfortunately it is inaccurate in many regards. I won't go over it in detail as a complete description of the roles of full nodes is available on [this wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Full_node).

Full nodes do validate every block to make sure they follow the current consensus rules. They will reject blocks if they do not match these rules, even if the rest of the network reports such block as valid. So having enough full nodes does play a role in securing the network as these nodes emitting invalid blocks will get ignored eventually (and won't be able to feed incorrect info to SPV clients for example).

So in short, full nodes remove the centralization of these tasks which would lie only in the hands of miners otherwise. If you do not see the benefits of this, I might be inclined to think that you are willing to give your trust to miners to always behave in your best interest. That's not something I'm ready to do.

If the usefulness of full nodes isn't clear for you I honestly think you should not write guides about it. I hope you do not take this the wrong way or as a personal attack. I am sure it took you some time to write this, but for completeness you should really consider updating it to include the actual roles full non-mining nodes play in Bitcoin's network."
"You're missing the point. I am very familiar with Ken Thompson and I completely agree with his argument, that's why I conceded that trust in manufacturers is absolutely required.

As per if 8 examined every line of code in my OS, obviously not, I've read only very small sections. But we're not discussing if it's secure, we're discussing if it's trustless. Being trustless means that it's verifiable by you or anyone else, it doesn't guarantee that you did verify it or that it is secure.

>With ISPs, in order to verify your version of the blockchain, you need access to the blockchain (unless you are **trusting** a third party for their version, like an SPV client). An ISP could perform a middleman attack, making you believe that you have the blockchain with the most proof of work, while delivering you an inferior blockchain.

There are several things that prevent this:

- HTTPS prevents the middle man attacks
- My ability to easily use several different connections (home, phone, coffeeshop) as well as the Bitcoin satellite prevents me from suffering from denial of service

>Exchanges: it's not a question of ""holding"", it's a question of acquisition and selling. I would guess that more than 99.9% of the holders of cryptocurrency have used an exchange, so I suspect you have.

Trading Fiat for Bitcoin isn't part of Bitcoin. Once I own Bitcoin, I no longer need to trust exchanges. I can also aquire it by mining or buying from localbitcoins.

Let me just make one thing clear: I am not in any way saying that these issues don't exist, they obviously do and an a convenient/realistic usage of Bitcoin will require you to trust some/most of the layers.

The point is that it is optional. You could, in theory, verify or have alternatives to almost all of the issues you mentioned. So it is (nearly) trustless, trusting a third party is not a requirement to use the system (apart from your hardware, which is a shame). "

Hi, that's me
I use a 128gb micro SD on mine that works fine. Wish more manufacturers would include micro SD slots but then they wouldn't make all that money on charging a boatload more for another 32gb

">You don't need to transmit full blocks. xthin and compact blocks reduce the transmission load to transaction hashes only.

Fair enough. But as you said above, that's kinda besides the point of this thread, then. :)
"Yes, but if you have a block that's currently 100 blocks deep, wouldn't you presume that it has that much PoW on top of it precisely because lots of other miners and nodes have validated it already?

I was talking about the initial sync, where I think it could make sense to work backwards instead of forwards when you, in the future, would have decades or work to catch up to.

"Prune. I can get a 4TB drive for under $150 and the current blockchain pruned is under 10GB, so at this rate I could run at 500MB blocks for about 5 years. At which point, I'll buy a new drive.

How is latency not an issue with centralized mining? It doesn’t matter how cheap storage becomes, miners will centralize more and more based on the size of blocks and want to be first in line to start mining the next block. Big blocks will make bitcoin become the thing we all hate. I feel like we’re building our own cage.
Might not have been a serious comment, but that doesn't take away the fact that bcash is willing to go to blocksizes of 100's of MB just to keep the fees low. You guys have some serious centrilisation problems comming up.

""The chain with the invalid block"" is actually subjective. That's the whole point. Validity is decided by nodes doing work. Of course everyone could just ""agree"" to be honorable, but this is not backed by anything. Mining is what makes it have authenticity to everyone else. Other nodes that aren't mining literally have zero relevance. They can ignore blocks all they want, but miners will respect the work of other miners, and ignore these impotent nodes. Of course, miners do not tolerate invalid blocks from other miners. But if a bunch of impotent nodes decide to call a certain block invalid, and the majority of mining power disagrees, the impotent nodes don't matter. They don't have chain to fall back to, and they are completely slaves to the miners.

> SPV wallets will gladly follow a block with invalid transactions on it as long as they're not your own. This means following a block that will be discarded.

This is actually possible, but only if you aren't vigilant enough with your SPV wallet. You can actually query the entire network if you want that level of security. So, again, you have the **exact** same security guarantees as you would running an impotent node. With an impotent node, you can be fooled by miners you connect to. The solution is the same as with SPV. Connect with more, and be robust.

> You haven't thought this through, how long do you think this person would have unnoticed access to those machines? They don't own the machines, so they can't just keep mining for days or weeks. Their best bet would be to do the attack one night and make a huge double spend.

No, I've thought it through quite a bit. It is a resource with value, so spending that value on ""mischief"" is less desirable than spending it on earning something of value. Do you not understand the game theoretical part of the white paper?

> Yes, it was meant to be a currency but it was worthless in the first months, so I don't see how it was more than experimentation by technical people at that point.

This is how many people felt about it. Many people also disregarded it, and many claimed it was impossible. Those people were wrong. The people that were experimenting with it and testing it considered it valuable, and kept a good proportion of money earned mining."
Data centers are already running multi-gigabit-per-second fibre links internally, and fibre between data centers goes at many times that. That is **today**, not years from now.
Again, that does not apply to a massively minority chain. Not to mention that they could just short bch while they're at it.
"But that isn't how it works you have to store the entire block-chain. 

In 8 years that will be what, 4TB? By then you'll have 16MB blocks. 

$120 a year just to be a node in terms of HDD space.


Anyway, I hope BCH keeps the blocks at 4MB"
"Do all Bitcoin Cash nodes support those features?

Anyway, that only removes the x2 penalty, since you still have to upload every transaction to each peer once."
That's an interesting point. Transactions handled by retail are usually processed in batch at the end of the day. The difference though being that the process provider has a way of covering fraudulent transactions and going after the card carrier. I believe this is the model lightning transactions are supposed to assist with because it would be like having a voucher for some reserve which makes it less likely that a person wouldn't transfer more funds before the block is actually processed, but since it is still essentially an anonymous transaction I don't see how that can be reconciled. Maybe I don't understand what lightning is supposed to resolve.

The nodes are heavily configurable, they can have many different purposes. The most useful ones (for the network) are the ones that help relay transactions but a business or individual may only be interested in verification of the blocks. 
"5 years?

500MB x 6 x 24 = 72 GB per day.
That is about 26.2 TB of data per year.

So you'll need about 7 of those 150 dollar harddrives you're talking about to run a node. If you truely want to run that node for 5 years, you'll need about 33 of those 4TB drives you're talking about. That will cost you about  $4950.

Game theory says otherwise.
What?
"There isn't such a mechanism. You just realized why the ""non-mining relay nodes verify transactions and keep the miners in check"" argument is bogus."
Use it for what exactly? You have 9 years of BTC existence and merchant adoptable for it has been going down and BCH is only increasing... Bitcoin Cash has done more in 4 months then what Core have done for years.
Bitcoin Cash scaling is unfeasible for any reasonable time frame. If you don't understand this you are either ignorant of the facts or ignoring them. You obviously will see improvements now but in a few years better scaling solutions will win out. Lightening Network looks promising but with the constant bickering that Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash people do I think the winner will most likely be another coin altogether. Meanwhile Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash will still be arguing over my dad can beat your dad.
Altruism? You're fundamentally misunderstanding the concept of Nash equilibrium. You'd have to burn literally millions.
"Yes, my Bitcoin XT node uses them right now.

It works because each node sees most transactions in the interval between blocks. They can then request individual transactions they are missing.

">They can ignore blocks all they want, but miners will respect the work of other miners, and ignore these impotent nodes.

And how is that working out for miners trying to sell Bitcoin Cash as if it was Bitcoin? Even if Bitcoin Cash becomes the chain with the most PoW, it won't matter, they won't be able to sell it as Bitcoin.

If the important entities are running nodes, they get to decide what rules they want to follow.

>But if a bunch of impotent nodes decide to call a certain block invalid, and the majority of mining power disagrees, the impotent nodes don't matter.

You call them impotent and yet they prevent miners from forcing businesses to follow rules they don't want and buying coins from the wrong chain.

>They don't have chain to fall back to, and they are completely slaves to the miners.

Game theory dude, if the money is on the other chain, there will be someone mining it. Mining is a job.

>So, again, you have the **exact** same security guarantees as you would running an impotent node.

How is it the exact same if one only needs one block to realize it's invalid and the other one needs to connect to _everyone_ to make sure the block is valid?

>No, I've thought it through quite a bit. It is a resource with value, so spending that value on ""mischief"" is less desirable than spending it on earning something of value.

You completely ignored my very simple example. Let me run the numbers for you:

You have 8 hours of access to what is probably more than 50% of the hashrate in mid-2009. You can earn roughly 50\*8\*4 BTC in that time (1600BTC) by being honest. That means any double spend over 1600BTC is better for you than being honest during those 8 hours. 

In 2010 a pizza was sold for 10000BTC, which was IIRC about $50 at the time.

Conclusion: In mid 2009 if you got access to more than 50% of the hashrate for 8 hours you'd make more money by double-spending $5 than being honest. 

This didn't happen.

>The people that were experimenting with it and testing it considered it valuable, and kept a good proportion of money earned mining.

There's lots of stories of people mining in 2009 and 2010 that were simply curious and completely forgot about it in the following months, many of them losing the keys forever by throwing out the computers or selling them. "

$50! Wow. We should/could get a tip army going with that. Like one of those old ponzi scams where you sent money to the top PayPal address then moved your name up the list but in reverse.
Yea, except to implement LN you are going to need to introduce Segwit and LN first on BCH - it's not as if it can just be turned on overnight. Look at segwit right now on Bitcoin. It's got barely any adoption - but it is growing due to community demand. These things take time. And guess what? By the time BCH does all the things needed to release LN (if it ever does) and have full market adoption, Bitcoin will have a significantly more trafficked, better connected, more secure LN with mass market adoption, why would anyone ever use LN on BCH? Plus, if BCH ever gets to a point where they feel the need to implement LN, it would be admitting BCH failed.
"You're completely misinformed. It doesn't require the whole Segwit package, just any good malleability fix and there are already proposals for that in BCH. https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7hqt7k/transaction_malleability_reference_post/ 
http://www.fintechist.com/malfix-solves-bitcoin-cash-malleability-issues/

Falling from a whopping 12% down to 10ish% is segwit “growing”? Yeesh. 
LN doesn't require Segwit you deluded moron
Fair, you don't technically need Segwit for LN, but I have NO idea why you would want a layer 2 solution to fix malleability issues without implementing segwit. Segwit literally makes transactions smaller so OBJECTIVELY, fees are always going to be smaller and blocks are more efficient. Introducing a malleability fix without it being the full segwit package is just stupid, for the same reason not doing a 2mb blocksize increase for Bitcoin is stupid... ego.
When core implements Segwit fully on their wallet, I suspect the market adoption will skyrocket. Until then seems a bit ambitious that it gets implemented by the masses. However, Core is under no time obligations. Their only obligation is to get it right.
"You're completely misinformed. Segwit doesn't make transactions smaller. In fact, they make them a little larger. You are refering to an accounting trick related to the 1 MB limit in the code.

"
"> Segwit literally makes transactions smaller

No it doesn't. It just stores the witness data in a different area which is not counted towards the 1MB limit. It does NOT reduce network usage or disk storage."
"Yes Segwit makes possible many nice things but it does it in a very questionable way: a rupe-goldberg soft-fork that completely alters the security model of Bitcoin and creates a complicated mess for more future upgrades and mainteinance. http://blog.vermorel.com/journal/2017/11/11/bitcoin-cash-is-bitcoin-a-software-ceo-perspective.html

The same ""nice things"" that Segwit allows can be obtained in a far more elegant way via hard-forks. BCH has a policy of hard-forks rather than soft-forks, so it's going get to the same ""nice things"" but without a legacy of spaghetti-code or breaking existing model. For the soft vs hard fork policy, you will find many different opinions online. The following is an article by Mike Hearn advocating for hard forks:
https://medium.com/@octskyward/on-consensus-and-forks-c6a050c792e7
"
Core, the team pushed for Segwit and is kicking and screaming that no one has implemented Segwit, has yet to do it themselves. Amazing. 10/10 ace developers
"> When

If"
Semantics. More transactions fit into a block. Fair?
This thing called segwit2x almost happened - don't know if you heard about it, but it had the core team scrambling to make sure Bitcoin was ready to handle a contentious hard fork. Again though... these things take time. I would much rather them release it when it is fully tested and ready than release it tomorrow with a bunch of bugs. BCH supporters that think they can just turn on LN as if it's some kind of switch that happens immediately are just completely misinformed. These are massive changes to the code/network that require huge amounts of time testing and verifying it works correctly.
">  and blocks are more efficient.

This is the bullshit part"
"> I would much rather them release it when it is fully tested

Me too. They should've never done this opt-in soft fork bullshit and just did a Segwit hard fork when it was good and ready."
Not an argument.

Sorry.  Facts don't care about your feelings.

They didn't
Stick that that argument if you want. Guess what? Without LN, BCH can't do microtransactions on scale without zero-fee, which isn't happening. Go listen again to the Ver/Carvalho interview. BCH is heading towards miners deciding how big blocks can get and which transactions can get through. You don't think this is going to create a fee market in the future similar to bitcoin? BCH has some MAJOR scaling problems on the horizon - so does Bitcoin. But don't bury your head in the sand and pretend BCH has it all figured out, cause all they did was put bubblegum over a leak that eventually is going to explode wide open.

I blame LN for the crash. Way too much hype, way too complicated and under deliverable."
Coregratulations!!!
Segwit2x is happening around Dec 28th.
"NO; they did not. Nobody is using Segwit, because you shills believe that it breaks the ""chain of signatures""... poor boys..."
"At the end of the day though, you solved the problem sooner than they did, yet you did it in a very simple and obvious way. BCC has the advantage atm, but I believe it's a short term advantage. I'm still willing to bet that BTC will overtake BCC in the long term simply because their scaling solution is about fitting more transactions in a single 1mb block rather than just raising the size of the block, AKA: being more efficient, not to mention I trust them much much more. 

That doesn't mean that BCC's price can't overtake BTC's price in the short term, alot of crazy stuff is going to go down in the next 6 months purely because of the fact that there's so much new money flowing into the ecosystem, but... when that stops, party is on temporarily hiatus for everyone.

Also, I used BCC the other day and it took just as long as bitcoin, over 1h to receive me funds and my ledger won't even let me pay a low fee anyways, so I don't see much of a difference from my stand point. If anything I am bugged by all the rhetoric on both subs and it's turning me off of bitcoin completely.

This is the first time Bitcoin has actually had honest-to-god scaling issues that wasn't purely manufactured by bad actors. Give them some time, I think they will surprise you.

Either way, I like both coins, but I could never chose one of them that's trying this hostile take over stuff and I'm sure I'm not the only one that feels that way.  When I got into Bitcoin I saw it as a much safer investment than I do now. There was only one bitcoin before, one bitcoin address, a handful of bitcoin exchanges, and one bitcoin forum I frequented. Now you have to hold 2 types of bitcoins to ""hedge"" against one losing versus the other, you gotta move your coins to new ""segwit"" from ""legacy"" address, or make sure you aren't sending BTC to BCH (even tho you can stil laccess the funds with the private key its a pain in the ass dude lol). 

If bitcoin wasn't user friendly before, it sure as hell isn't now... either chain lol. It's got more confusing to the average user, not less. If anything the waters are muddy and it's hard to tell what's up and what's down... But, I don't expect anyone to listen to me lol.

Either way, it's dangerous to follow these coins in such a cult-ish manner as it inevitably clouds your judgement and you become partial to one coin over another, regardless whether one is doing better than the other. This goes for both sides lol.

Hell, let's be honest here... the coin that's going to win is the one thats first out of the gate with the capability to do 30k+ transactions a second, near instant transactions for the user, and doesn't take tons of power. Imo, alot of coins are already beat, including both iterations of Bitcoin."
">They asked for 1MB blocks. They got it.

Most Core devs and supporters  asked for 2MB block averages and 4MB block limit . We are still waiting on more segwit adoption to get those numbers

"Yet they claim all their issues are because we are attacking them.

And LN according to their estimates still needs another 18 months and it will probably be even longer than that. I doubt bitcoin will still be around if they continue for two years to avoid the scalability problem"

Yeah, some buy the support packages.  But you know as well as I do anybody who knows Linux doesn't need to pay for it nor do they really need to pay for support.

different people but same goal. we need a cryptocurrency not a cryptoasset. bitcoin gained its value as a currency not a store of value. again, you can buy out the devs but the decentralizing nature of crypto will run core to the ground. keep forking core, keep double spending. less and less merchants will take bitcoin core while more and more adopt bitcoin.

Nobody has any clue where blockstream try to go with Bitcoin now.. (only that they said they were happy with $100-$1000 fees)"

"He is saying that to prove a point.  If you can have a 1TB block limit now, why not 8mb?

Unless bandwidth and storage capacity stops growing today, you can scale, solely by larger block for the foreseeable future.

Bitcoin grew for 7 or 8 years with no block limit.  As soon as it reached a block limit, all these problems started.  The miner reward, today, is enough to pay the miners and we could have .20 cent BTC transactions.  Today.

If the miners were making a profit in October, at $3,500, certainly they can make a profit at $20,000.

This nonsense that Bitcoin can't scale by growing blocks is a fabrication of blockstream, told and retold so many times that people think it is a fact."

"Wrong. I am against the infighting and the pettiness of the Bs and the shady non transparent dealings.  I'd rather see them working together and finding a way to properly legitimize this thing into the main stream rather than still being fragmented and acting like a bunch of cyberpunks still trying to stick it to the man.  And yes, addressing how the terrorists are using it to their advantage now and what to do about it is a topic that must be discussed openly.

And stop talking about USD.  It's hardly a benchmark you should be measuring against except the ubiquitous-ness and global acceptance of it.  Any other comparison to USD just sounds like you are saying what we have sucks less it they that sucks too.

"Full nodes do nothing except tell the owner if his transaction is good until it is recorded on the chain.

What you're saying is a blockstream talking point that has been repeated so many times that it is taken as fact.  Even Satoshi said that in time only the mining farms would run nodes and everyone else would use a simple wallet."
What about this is decentralized I'd like to ask? Genuine question...
"""Long before the network gets anywhere near as large as that, it would be safe 
for users to use Simplified Payment Verification (section 8) to check for 
double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or 
about 12KB per day.  **Only people trying to create new coins would need to run 
network nodes.  At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the 
network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to 
specialists with server farms of specialized hardware.  A server farm would 
only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with 
that one node.**

""The bandwidth might not be as prohibitive as you think.  A typical transaction 
would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact).  Each transaction has to be 
broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction.  Visa processed 37 billion 
transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day.  
That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or 
2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices.

**""If the network were to get that big, it would take several years, and by then, 
sending 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a big deal.""**

Says the guy who doesn't know what terrorism is lol
I'm asking you... Whatever does decentralized mean to you?  Let's take it beyond the buzzword.
Bubba's basement computer is what keeps this whole thing decentralized. Before ASIC mining, the two were one and the same.
I guess for a pyramid scheme, technical don’t matter so much.
"What decentralisation are tou talking about?

Distribution, mining, nodes, development?"
He's talking about mining nodes, not Bubba's basement computer.
"Your comments make complete sense from your technical perspective. I'm not talking about the technical perspective.   The problem is, all the infighting will give opportunities to others.  Divide and conquer.  If you still don't get it and want to stick to the low level technical debate then I'm done. Yes, I said infighting...2 brothers trying to be the winner.  You guys lost at the fork already. 
"
You're avoiding the question.  And actually, there can be no decentralization of anything without some sort of distribution, no matter if it's in equal or unequal parts.
"Great! So whens he converting the half that's the ""erroneous"" BTC to the ""legitimate"" bch?"
"Are you confusing possibility with practicality?

A name is an identity label - if I wanted to identify you on reddit, I'd call you LookAnts. You are defined by what people on this website know you through your actions - that being your posts (past, present and future) as well your karma points, personality, etc. These things can, and will, change over time. If you became famous on Reddit, and changed from a BCH supporter to a BTC supporter, you'd still be identified through majority recognition, as LookAnts.

This is key when identifying the difference between Bitcoin/BTC and Bitcoin Cash. The understanding of every single crypto-exchange in the world is that BTC is Bitcoin. No matter what happens, no matter if it plummets to the ground and becomes worth $1 per BTC, it will still be Bitcoin. Because an identity of an asset, much like that of a person, isn't defined by what they should have been - it's defined by what they are, at this present moment.

Bitcoin is not easily transactionable. Bitcoin Cash is easily transactionable. Bitcoin is worth $11k+. Bitcoin Cash is worth sub $4k. Bitcoin has a capped block size. Bitcoin Cash doesn't.

They're different. To want BCH to be recognized as Bitcoin at this stage of the game just brings confusion to potential investors, and somewhat encourages mistaken purchases between BCH and BTC. This is tantamount to fraud at worst, and just plain confusing at best. 

As such, it is indeed possible to call any derivative as Bitcoin. However, it is very very impractical. "

"Decentralized is a buzz word that is over used and way too vague.

Do you honestly feel it's decentralized and fairly and equally distributed right now?  If so, in what sense?"
So when's satoshi converting his BTC to bcash?
Full nodes enforce consensus rules. They prevent a miner hijacking. Miners do not rule Bitcoin.
"So your are against cryptocurrencies because it finances terrorist.

Must be against the dollar too?"
i choose bitcoin over core because of the lack of double spending via stupid forks due to the change in vision of what bitcoin should be. if i wanted a centralized power to generate wealth via double spending, id go back to the USD... 
"Roger and Satoshi both wanted to have a decentralised cryptocurrency.

I have no idea what the core dev team BS want to be honest.. sone kind of new asset.. a pyramid scheme?"
Has no center.
"> it would be safe for users to use Simplified Payment Verification (section 8)

Section 8:

> As such, the verification is reliable **as long as honest nodes control the network, but is more vulnerable if the network is overpowered by an attacker.**

It's pretty clear Satoshi wasn't advocating miner centralization:

> The more smaller farms resort to generating bitcoins, the higher the 
bar gets to overpower the network, making larger farms also too small to 
overpower it so that they may as well generate bitcoins too.  According to the 
""long tail"" theory, the small, medium and merely large farms put together 
should add up to a lot more than the biggest zombie farm.

We're not seeing more smaller farms. Instead, in their place, we're seeing non-mining full nodes."
"Then it's a fail already.  You don't realize that a very small group of people control and manipulate it already? In terms of development, mining and number of coins being held?

Your answer clearly shows people use ""decentralized"" way too much with little meaning of what it means in reality as it currently stands today.

Edit: I don't mean this of every coin.  But certainly holds true for the 2 currently most popular.  It looks to be a direct factor of the currency's popularity which makes sense.  The more relevant it is the more people want to control it."

I disagree. The amount of computing power enterprises can buy would be more than enough to overshadow any small miner.

Yeah, it's not like Intel has a monopoly on CPUs or anything."
Transaction malleability prevents bi-directional payment channels from being opened safely if one party is uncooperative.  These are part of the Rube Goldberg design of Lightening network.  As far as I aware, this is the only (proposed) application that requires a malleability fix
It  might be good or bad, depending on how fast you could make the trades and how long it took for the next BCH block to be mined.  While you were waiting the markets could have moved.  Plus the two exchanges may have different pricing for various reasons. (One big reason would be friction arbitrageurs face due to BTC fees and delays.)
well, of course u don’t own it . Your boss does.Give a few days and u will see bcash dumped like trash , which makes it more sense to call it btrash as some people does. 
Explain your reasoning. 
"Here come the downvotes, but...

He's asserting, not acknowledging. Just because you say something doesn't make it true. Even in the crypto world, there are rules.

BCH *shouldn't* be called ""Bitcoin"", because it's *not* Bitcoin. Bitcoin is Bitcoin. Always has been, always will be. By insisting, wrongly, that Bitcoin Cash should be simply called ""Bitcoin"", you are doing nothing but demonstrating that branding is the only thing of substance offered."
It's still fast and reliable and secure if you pay the fee. The only fair criticism is it is insanely expensive right now. That is why I support an immediate 2mb blocksize increase. And yes - segwit/LN/schnorr are going to be HUGE upgrades when they do happen and are fully integrated.

"You won't lose anything moving your  BTC from Coinbase to GDAX.  Depending on how you trade there may be a GDAX commission.  You can move all of the  new BCH back to your Coinbase BCH and then if you have  BCH wallet you can then move your combined BCH off Coinbase.  This last step will cost you a tiny BCH mining fee.  (It may be possible to get GDAX to eat this fee, but it shouldn't be more than one cent, either way.)

That's why the most successful people in SV are not necessarily the tech heads, they are the ones that can apply tech to the real world and design from a macro level.

"You probably want to go a tad further than that, and you know, be careful. Linux is fantastic, I've been a convert for 15+ years at this point (mostly on debian..) but in that time the number of stupid mistakes in configs I've seen are staggering.  A big part of that is people playing with their installations to see what stuff does, setting up web/mail/database servers on their local machines and forgetting about them etc.. 

My favourite was coming across someone who was publishing their entire home directory via various methods (NFS/SMB/HTTP) whenever they were connected to network using the same subnet as their home one... A combination of clever solution to their problems at home, and a bit of a silly approach to firewall rules..

If things that change and evolve can keep their name, then surely any derivative of bitcoin can be called bitcoin. 
Bank transfers are fast, too, if you pay enough fees. What's your point? 
i'm talking about from a 51% attack perspective.  i don't see any problems with big ASIC pools since, imo, we have enough decentralization of these big pools across the world right now.
And if you want an OS that hasn't changed, use Windows 95. Pretty solid analogy.
"The botnet situation is more of a computer security problem, not with the cryptocurrency POW algorithm. If users ran 
more secure OSes like Linux there would be less botnets.

If large enterprises bought more CPUs then  they would earn more money. But there would still be money to be made for small time miners by mining in a pool. With general purpose CPUs they can be run on anything like a server, PC, phone etc. The situation now with only one company selling ASIC miners (Bitmain) is a monopoly and untenable long term."

"To me, much of this sounds like you've read some common talking points passed around in other arenas and accepted them as truth without diving into the details behind the points.

>Sustainable fees to pay for the proof of work instead of a block reward that is halving every 4 years seem to me the only way forward. 

If the price ONLY doubled in 4 years, you'd have equivalent security to today.  Keep in mind, that Bitcoin price has averaged over 3x / year for most of it's history.  That's an increase of 40 fold AFTER the halving.  So, based on history (or how else would you make any projections), we can expect 40 times as much security for the network from price increase alone without factoring in fees.  That's about $1trillion dollars per day in security.  $1 Trillion.  Let that sink in...  And you want fees to be added to that?  Is your personal wallet secured at the same level as national nuclear codes just because more security is better?

>the only viable way to make bitcoins a world wide currency is to create a payment network like Lightning

How can you say this when there are SO many alternate ways to approach crypto scaling in process? Have you read any of the counterarguments for Lightning?  This network security that you were just talking about is decreased due to Lightning - miner fees are reduced.  If Lightning had majority use in a blockchain, it potentially destroys the carefully balanced incentive model between users and miners.  There are technical challenges that haven't been overcome at smaller scales much less tested in a world-wide application.  Lightning does offer some potential advantages and have some good use cases - but basing the entire Bitcoin future on that one concept while everyone else in crypto is looking into various solutions seems crazy to me.  Perhaps I'm overstating your personal view here, but it is such a common talking point that ""Lightning will just make everything better, soon (TM)"" that it gets my ire up.

"I thought about it a bit more than that. I've been following discussions for a while now. And this conclusion didn't come easy. Being censorship resistant to me means a lot of people can easily verify with low budget hardware and slow internet connections. It also means that miners (not pools, that's a different level of discussion) must be all around the world. 

Check [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=4936&v=QkYXPJMqBNk) presentation with Nick Szabo on using radio for transmission of blocks to get around censorship. That's the level of security you'll need if this becomes a threat to nations.

I'm not really suggesting one perfect solution, but I understand the arguments from the different approaches.

You might end up being right about such poor conditions never allowing Bitcoin, but I would want to bet on it. I saw the internet grow from free and practically anonymous for everyone to a huge surveillance and propaganda mechanism.

Yes, i agree fully and think exact same thing. They really make me sick... but fight must go one... until we win.
If the whole industry is about nothing but purely speculative investing based on others investing speculatively, and if that's all it could ever be, then good riddance if it all goes to 0. I don't think it is though.
"> there's nothing but speculation propping it up.

I don't think this is true. Being able to send money to someone anywhere in the world fast and cheap is the utility and it's the reason I got into bitcoin in the first place."
There's supposed to be a certain utility. BTC has lost it though.
">  Being censorship resistant to me means a lot of people can easily verify with low budget hardware and slow internet connections

What you're asking for is not Lightning but rather SPV.  SPV says each individual user can observe the network at a level that requires minimal personal effort with maximum assurance.

Radio transmissions can be triangulated to find the source - is that really something that is going to allow an individual to escape the reach of the state?  If you're talking about nations crossing borders, I'd expect there are many other concerns than currency.  In those conditions, people are likely using barter systems for subversive economic systems.  And perhaps if such conditions exist it need not be the domain of a worldwide monetary standard to server those particular needs when a more suitable crypto could be used instead.  Or perhaps you are suggesting that Bitcoin should serve a small, anonymous userbase and another crypto should reach wider acceptance?"
No, he meant BCH is different from BTC.
"The second issue - social engineering attack - was defended against in August 1st, but ripples, or should I say, tsunami, will be felt during a long time as it seems

I've 0 doubts about it. I just've no idea about the timeframe. Gox cost several months. How much Blockstream's BTC will cost us on top of the past years?"
"The point of the post though was just to point out that the writing has been on the wall for a long time with BTC. Nothing to do with BCH. The fact that has gone down as well is kind of inevitable but that's a different story.

This post would have been more appropriate in r/bitcoin but of course it would have been removed by the censors immediately"

Not really. I don't know if you've noticed that there is a much bigger focus in the economics, the technology and the social issues of Bitcoin vs the pure obsession in the price of the censored sub.

Go read the thread where Greg is literally celebrating the current state of Bitcoin.
"They were heavily replaced by millions of imbecilic get rich quick new 'investors' who had been hearing about Bitcoin for years and never signed up. Many actually shat on it for years. So when they finally signed up want it to go perfectly and to see big gains. They don't want anyone to talk shit about the issues that didn't exist before they bought, and they don't want you talking shit about ""Core"" who they believe are the original devs and people you made Bitcoin become so successful. 

To sum it up, they are really fucking bad at knowing what they are investing it. I met so many people at Christmas parties this year. ALL bought in in the last three weeks. Many thought I was some kind of god for having bought at $2 in 2011. Few of them knew about Blockstream or even any of the problems with the net. One had done his research and invested in Ethereum instead because of Bitcoins issues, he was smart. "
Big franchises didn’t know bitcoin took 4 hours to process lol

"I don't like high fees either, but like anybody else I was quickly skeptical of a blockchain scaling to a massive payment network. Sustainable fees to pay for the proof of work instead of a block reward that is halving every 4 years seem to me the only way forward. Sure we could have lower security blockchains with less usage to keep doing on chain transactions, but at some point the only viable way to make bitcoins a world wide currency is to create a payment network like Lightning. 

Personally I'm happy to see Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum... even Ripple and many others compete with what they think is the right model. Unfortunately solve less of the global banking problems and rampant money printing than others, but I think all of them, probably even Ripple are a step forward. Bitcoin Core might just be a bit too ambitious in thinking that maximum decentralization can scale to enough users fast enough. 



would be the only way forward "
You forgot Jihan /s
Exactly. This is very recent development in the crypto world and many of us think it didn't have to be this way.
Thanks- I’m trying Bitstamp currently- was already approved and they have BCH. I exchanged for ETH on Gemini first as recommended here- and when that’s authorized I’ll send it to bitstamp and make the exchange. In the meantime i sent a small amount of my gemini BTC to bitstamp as well, and did a small BTC-BCH transaction.  I’m only starting to understand this madness and I swear i don’t know what I’d do without Reddit geniuses.

How its useful? Any ATMS wit BCash? Any Debit card with BCash? So you use it just for cheap transfers? ... well its clear you're just shilling.
Yep. Years ago. Left the moment I had proof it was being censored.
Yeah well you were most likely in /r/bitcoin before you were driven out I'm sure. A decentralized coin relying on a centralized source of information is a recipe for disaster imo.
Ok, so youre a shill. Drop dead.
"Zero arguments on your part. 

If you actually care about cryptographic currency becoming anything more than a failed experiment, why can't you even try to not misunderstand people? It takes time to write this stuff, and you just resort to name calling."
And Erik uses the segwit discount.
"Erik, you've certainly been very ""reasonable,"" but this has included extending the benefit of the doubt to authoritarians and censors and acting as though their position is equally worthy of consideration.

Regardless of their technical ideas (which are also completely harebrained), the fact that they rely on such tactics should warrant nothing but strong condemnation, especially from someone so liberty-minded as yourself. "
"you went back on your word. 

you're in bed with core by inaction."
Remember when you said you'd support a fork away from Core if they refused a blocksize increase? You went back on your word. Bitcoin Cash is clearly in line with your original statement.
I think the point is that you should publicly support the coin whose fundamentals are in line with what you believe Bitcoin should be.
"And after so much effort to prevent a block size increase they are looking into it know? W T F..

all that happen was 100% predictable and now they realize the consequences of their decisions..

No he didn't, he holds equivalent amount of coins for both coins. That's how he's done with the scaling debate. Whoever wins, he wins.

Cognitive dissonance can be a bitch. Get past it.

"Erik, I don't say this lightly, but consider dropping BTC from ShapeShift altogether if the business is actively losing money on BTC trades due to fees.

The leading Core developers say that BTC is not for transacting. It has no use case other than hold and admire like a rare beanie baby. Indulge them and drop support for it, at least until they come around to an actual scaling solution (which they won't, the coin will be long relegated to history by the time LN is widely usable)."
Don't lose faith in Bitcoin Segwit. I heard rumor that Lightning Network is coming soon in 18 months. It could even cure cancer and teleport people to Uranus.
You are a public figure in Bitcoin. People want to see you out there *supporting* what you believe in, as you had *supported* Bitcoin before it forked away from its fundamentals..
"I know many of us saw the failure of 2x as the final straw, but shouldn't someone like you be a leader in moving Bitcoin forward, not a reluctant passenger on the train someone else is conducting? I remember when you used to be a pioneer. Now you seem meek.

Litecoin core. Same problems.
Litecoin was bought out by Blockstream. It's now effectively run by the banks. Charlie Lee, the founder of Litecoin, has washed his hands of it and sold all his Litecoin.
Because Litecoin doesn't have 9 years of hard-earned issuance to the hardest working miner. Its distribution SUCKS. Bitcoin does, and now Bitcoin can scale.
"I’m glad for it, because he is a very intelligent prominent figure who has bent over backwards to accommodate and support core.

I hear it's only 18 months away. there is just no other solution at all, we'll just have to abandon market share and first mover advantage and piss off millions of users with high fees until maybe 18 months. Now that's some sound logic.

I wonder what the average crumb is worth right now...
Erik, you were the one sucking cores dicks for years. Now you pretend that any of this is a news.
If only the devs were so competent that they would fix everything by, oh I don't know, increasing block size?
Not sure what price you sold at but if it was let's say 15k, that's about 2% fee. I pay more than that on my merchant processing when someone uses a miles or rewards credit card at my shop.

Dear Erik. The fees are cause for celebration and champagne https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2017-December/015455.html
I wonder what percentage of btc’s value is from wallet crumbs that can never be moved.  I know that I was disappointed when my mycelium wallet had some btc where the fee in November was more than the amount in the wallet.  I can only imagine how pissed people must be now.  This has got to be a global issue, thousands of bag holders who can’t move $100 crumbs.
But Adam wants to make some money by shorting Bitcoin. How else would he be able to pay the trolls?
Oh, Erik FINALLY admits there's a problem? Erik is a hypocrite... talking and speaking about censorship-resistant money, how we must separate money from the state, blah, blah, blah... and then he supports Core for all these years and continues to support them? Zero respect for Erik because he has zero integrity.

Eric, don't you know that's exactly what Greg and Adam want?
"Emergency Fee Reduction is underway right now...  just crash the price sufficiently and 2000sat/byte becomes cheap.  :=)

Holy cow, that’s insane.  I remember being pissed when I had. 0.75cent fee.  I thought, “shit I can’t buy a coffee with this.”  Crazy to thinks it’s gone off the rails to that extent.  I’m so thankful Bitcoin Cash came along and brought the vision and utility back. 
"Dear Mr Voorhees, are you ever going to realize how problematic your assumption of good faith actors in Bitcoin Core are getting?

Note: Not the same as an assumption of bad faith."
"I have no idea why Erik is complaining. Fees are exactly within the BScore plan, just maybe a little too low.

"We have, long ago, and we solved that problem with a stupid simple upgrade **and** successfully tested **extremely** larger blocks in preparation for the future

If you're going to complain about high fees of BTC, you should at least mention the alternative which is Bitcoin Cash.
When is this guy just going to get a grip and move to BCH?
The fees will be the downfall of Bitcoin and it might put a dent in the cryptocurrency space. Core is really fucking everyone at this point.

Erik. I completely hear you. But linear on-chain scaling does little relative to exponential global demand. Worse yet, it requires a hard fork and recent experience shows hard forks are highly dangerous.

I agree that increasing the blocksize a modest size is probably 'safe' to do, even though if it is merely can kicking. However, I do not believe after the recent fork wars that *any* hardfork is safe to do now, if ever. I don't know the answer but I don't think a hardfork is it.

Small blocker are going soft.."
Uhh we do realize, that's why we have Bitcoin Cash.
"First they took his satoshidice transactions. Erik didn't do anything. Erik complied.

Now they take his shapeshift transactions. Erik doesn't do anything. Erik complies.

Just a little shy bark comes out of him. 

Good boy, Erik, good boy.
"
Don't worry, fees will drop when no-one uses BTC.
I personally don't care if they fix it at this point.  The smart money has moved to BCH.  Once the merchant adoption comes there's no reason to ever look back at corecoin again. 
Sometimes I wonder if all this needles drama in Bitcoin is created by alt coin people trying to destroy us. 
"Excellent.

https://i.imgur.com/vcot1Db.jpg"
BUT MUH PAYMENT CHANNELS
I am not sure why he is complaining either. Erik told us he is done with the scaling debate. Maybe Erik should shut the fuck up.
Exchanges should open BCH pairs right now. Problems would reduce a lot.
My position (in units, not USD) in BTC and BCH is roughly equal now. After SegWit2x failed, I acquired BCH. 
He just can't seem to let go... probably sold his cash.
Grotesque.
F***k  him  ....  First preaching scaling through litecoin and then that! 
"And now people in the other sub would rather sit tight than accept at least any immediate stopgap fix so they can use Bitcoin for everyday purchases. Those ""my local Subway is accepting Bitcoin!"" posts seem to be long forgotten."
I'm sure Erik is quite happy with the about of alt trading that goes on shapeshift because the block limit on btc wasn't removed.
With whom did I throw in with, exactly? The zealots in both subs hate me, so I’m probably being completely reasonable.
"I have not “continued to support core”. They hate me, btw, because I’ve been telling them for years a block size increase is warranted. 

However I also don’t vilify them or assume they are all evil witches. "
So many disingenuous hypocrite cunts in this space. Who knew freeing the world from the bondage of central banks would be so difficult.
"The respective Bitcoin Cash crumbs are easily movable.

"Just let it go. Use Cash (Bitcoin Cash or Bank Notes)
"
not the only alternative, but ok
I own lots of both now.
"More over it's exactly what BS/Core proponents said they were doing. 

Erik supported their actions because it was the politically correct thing to do. "
It doesn't matter, you have enough time to educate yourself.
lightening needs to be implemented asap.Core needs to communicate better 
"How can anyone in this group call Erik Voorhees a four letter word or a hypocrite or anything of the sort? Even if he was that bad, is his how we treat and convince influential people in the space? Where is our integrity?

He’s shown nothing but class, please do likewise"
"This problem was illustrated 3 years ago and solutions proposed.

Erik among others rejected the proposed solutions. He said I'll give Core a year befor I'll consider forking away.

A year later he said that's not what he meant. And said we need to work with Core effectively complying with their plan for high fees and layer 2.

6 months later he agreed to a compromise with himself implement Core's Segwit and increase the transaction limit.

6 after that he was complicit in implementing Segwit and he withdraw his intention to increase the 2X transaction limit.

Meanwhile the people who took action upgraded the bitcoin transaction limit without Eric and Core.

Erik the BTC chain is working as designed. 

The bitcoin upgrade is now called bitcoin cash.

You got what you asked for if you don't like it you're welcome to use the original bitcoin with a transaction capacity increase. "
It's ShapeShift's job to provide SegWit and LN solutions.
"I've seen u/evoorhees twice post that he's ""done with the scaling debate forever."" Clearly his recent tweets and reddit comments are in contrast to this. I understand it, Erik. It's frustrating. I had hoped that after the August fork (named differently by different people) and the defeat of S2X, the two camps would just separate and stop fighting. Alas, it's not to be.

I hate to say it (because I've found shapeshift useful and recommend it to people), but if this is really so frustrating to Erik that he/you can't let it go, maybe BTC should just be ""Temporarily Unavailable"" on shapshift for a while. If the fees don't come down in a few weeks, shapeshift might even consider dropping it altogether.

I do think someday Erik will come to realize some of his friends (Roger Ver) and colleagues (Brian Armstrong) were actively attacking the bitcoin network over the past few years. He might change his opinion in retrospect. But for now, maybe it's time to just let BTC go its own way. Making further comments about it isn't going to have any affect except to alienate people. Bitcoin is not going to hard fork to raise the block size any time soon no matter what Erik says or does. Maybe it will hard fork to raise the block size someday, but I don't think it should even be discussed for another year or two. We've had the fight. We've had the split. Move on. Erik is someone I respect from afar, and I'd prefer if he moved on without the vitriol and recriminations. Ultimately, that's up to him, of course."

>- BCH is attempting to hijack the Bitcoin name and brand; just look at the logo, it's literally the Bitcoin logo tilted back a few degrees. Why not just create a new brand rather than trying to fool the uninformed?

Core do not own the bitcoin brand. No one owns the bitcoin brand. There was a significant split in the bitcoin community, and so the chain split in two. Which means bitcoin is now split in two, with two visions. Which one is the ""true"" bitcoin is up to interpretation. That is not an attack. It's funny though that BCH is supported by the oldschool bitcoiners and original devs - makes you wonder how BTC has a claim to being the original bitcoin.

"
"> makes you wonder how BTC has a claim to being the original bitcoin

Simple. BTC *is* the original Bitcoin since BCH forked from the BTC codebase."

"In my humble opinion, the only reason why most miners still mine, it's because of the USD/EUR/(pick your fiat) they can get in return.
The profit is the capability to transfer the value to fiat, because as you said, *miners want to eat, f*ck and by lambos*, and currently, you need fiat for that (at least, to buy lambos). 

Bitcoin adoption in the early days, was merely a fantasy. I don't think that people mined coins in those times, because they though they were going to get rich. I know people that have lost wallets with thousands of bitcoins, because they erased them from their computers. Having said that, I honestly don't know how we can compare the early Bitcoin days (0 tx fees) with the current days. 

But I ask now. **Why didn't the miners support the 1st of August fork?**
Does the majority of miners really want low fees or do they prefer to guarantee a long term profit through transaction fees? 
After all, what will a miner do when there are no more coins to mine? (I know that this is sketchy, but quantum computers aren't that far in the future). 

"
"> but why shut other people down who try? 

Where did I say to do that?


Just because I'm not serving you up on a silver platter doesn't mean I'm holding you back. There is a middle ground you are trying very hard to pretend doesn't exist.

I give what I get."
"This is what I've prior referred to as the fork of visions for Bitcoin. This psychological fork preceded the real fork.

The vision for Bitcoin used to be the complete opposite of what you're espousing. It was about decentralized, censorship-resistant transactions that were extremely low-cost, only coming at the trade-off of waiting for block confirmation (an inevitable result of any blockchain system). Bitcoin was supposed to free Venezuelans from hyperinflation, capital controls and government-sponsored violence. It was supposed to lift up a class of under-banked or unbanked individuals who for whatever reason were locked out of the banking system.

Now, Bitcoin (Core) has happily wed itself with the legacy financial system. What most people mean by ""bitcoin"" is really coinbase since they don't even own their own private keys nor do they make on-chain transactions.

(Yes, for sending $100,000 fees are negligible. They're not negligible for as high as $1000. 40/1000 is a ridiculous percentage.

Even with LN, blocksize must eventually grow exponentially if adoption grows exponentially. I think this is very clear to see, but I can break out the napkin math if you would like.

---

Additionally...how can LN transactions be censorship resistant? Is that even possible?"
"AFAIK roadmap is blocksize removal. Detailed info should be on Bitcoin ABC site

Competition is good"
"People need to think independently make good choises if they wind up following they're going to risk being burned. 

We can educate but we can't be responsible for ignorance or those who intentionally mislead the new comers."
Get rid of him? What? You know he volunteers autonomously to do Bitcoin Cash PR right? He's not an employee we can fire.
"Without a blocksize, is it possible for the transaction fees to drop to zero? 
If so, what will be the incentive of a miner to mine without collecting fees?
"
"You can stop praising him for one, and let him know his tact is not appreciated.  

Though he will probably just react by telling you go fuck yourself and do his thing anyway."
"> the incentive of a miner to mine without collecting fees?

Supporting userbase and future profits. Bitcoin tx has two and only two parameters: validity by current Nakamoto consensus and economic feasibility

Supply and demand of blockspace for winning miner: If miner can produce as much as he wants, currently able to produce 3 and recieved 2 in txs with fees and 1 in txs without fees, there's more to lose than to gain by excluding the latter - slower network effect, less money made in the future. Network effect directly influences mining profitability and, **more importantly**, stable level of future profitability. Miner wants to eat, fuck and buy lambos today, tomorrow, next week and next year. If he has 3 and recieved 4 in txs without fees, he'll discriminate and cut 25% off from this block. If there'll be no txs with fees, miner will eventually go bankrupt and sooner or later open blockchain will become insecure

It's not what actually happens. We don't need to theoretisize much: just watch charts of early years of Bitcoin and current charts of Bitcoin Cash to get idea of fee market when blocks aren't full. It works flawlessly. Some txs are 0-fee in both cases. No permanent exclusion, cos it makes no economical sense"
">  Bitcoin was supposed to free Venezuelans from hyperinflation, capital controls and government-sponsored violence.

Yes I know, an utopian vision. Not possible in the real life. Miners are persecuted in Venezuella and the Venezuella Government is very effective in censoring communications.

> Now, Bitcoin (Core) has happily wed itself with the legacy financial system.

Kill it from within, maybe? 

> Additionally...how can LN transactions be censorship resistant? Is that even possible?

I don't know the details of the LN mechanism. I can't answer that question.

"
Thank you for your comments!
"> the only reason

Profitability. Miners who ignore profitability lose competition and/or go bankrupt

> Why didn't the miners support the 1st of August fork?

Giant chain split is still unresolved. Majority of miners are ready to mine either chain"
">Shouldn't the increase of miners, reduce the amount of transaction fees?

No, this is a common misconception. At difficulty level N, increasing hashrate *does* increase network throughput. But it's a losing battle, because difficulty adjusts after a couple thousand blocks and then we're back to an average 10 minute block time.

The only way to scale on-chain is to make the chain bigger, period [or transactions smaller]. Segwit does this (higher block size) too, but with an ugly, convoluted accounting trick - they ""pretend"" that Segwit blocks ""weigh less"", even though they don't, which is the same as a blocksize increase but only conditional upon segwit activation. To me this is very, very bad...obviously BTC supporters don't seem to think so.

I also personally don't understand *why* witness data would need to be moved into its own section. Do you have any insight on that to share? Segwit just seems so ugly to me

>I don't pay attention to that. I'm not the type of person who receives their daily dose of incentives by micro-trophies :)

Heh, neither do I (at least for my own comments), but I hate being censored in /r/Bitcoin (I'm banned from there, lol) so I don't like to see dissenting viewpoints downvoted here if it's real discussion"
How can a miner blacklist addresses? With decentralisation, another miner is just gonna include that tx in a block. Nobody can control the blockchain like I said.
"You run a full-blockchain non-mining node, so you presumably care about BTC.

How often do you transact in it? I ask because I've been paying $30-40 fees (damn those UTXOs from using bitcoin as recommended) per transaction. If you actually use BTC, the cost of using BTC is higher than the cost of increasing storage space."
"The 1TB will only be possible on the BCH chain. 

If you could do everything you can think of to make sure the BTC chain keeps the 1MB limit I'd be very thankful. "
You provide an important service for SPV clients, and help out holding all these unconfirmed transactions in mempool. But that's the extent of what a full-blockchain non-mining node does (man that's long, but I prefer it to full node)
"The stated reason is insider trading. Coinbase added BCH trading suddenly, without any warning. \r\bitcoin believes this was done to allow insiders to trade before anyone else knew about it.

The *real* reason, I think, is because \r\bitcoin wants BCH to die quickly. Coinbase adding BCH gives it legitimacy and exposure. The folks in \r\bitcoin desperately want to be right about BCH crashing and burning. They're having a tantrum because reality isn't following their expectations."
It's inevitable that they'll add BCH.  But I think they'll wait at least a few weeks for the outrage at Coinbase to die down.
You know it's mostly bluster, not so many people will actually change exchange, talk is cheap... Meanwhile immediately Gemini stands to gain more from adding BCH trading pairs... Longer term Gemini gains goodwill from being on the right side, the winning side, the side that ends up with the money. No brainier
Unprofessional how?
Exchange for dollars then buy BCH.  Move it GDAX to do that.
">  Do you have any insight on that to share?

In my opinion, Segwit is a way of increasing the blocksize without needing an hardfork. I understand why they did it, or at least, I understand the reasons which took them to do it.

Hard-forks will always be connected to instability and market speculation. 
It is always a time of uncertainty and uncertainty kills currencies. 
Example > British Pound right after the Brexit voting, even though Brexit would only occur 2 years after.

Yes, segwit is a hack but it was in my opinion, a safer move than an hard-fork. Still, it doesn't solve the Bitcoin problem in the long term. Maybe Lightning Network will, but I'm no fortune-teller. "
"I think exponential growth of transaction number is a fair assumption, **even with the lightning network**. This is due to the principle of relativity. Even if LN eliminates 95% of transactions, more users means more opening/closing lightning channels = still exponential blocksize growth

However this is counteracted by exponential decrease in cost of computing power + storage space. Thus I am not afraid of large blocks hiding under my bed at night."
"I don't currently transact bitcoins simply because there's nothing I can buy with then where I live.

I only have it running because it keeps a copy of the blockchain in my server."
"Sorry you got downvoted. I don't think you're right but I do think you're contributing to the discussion.

Miners don't need fees as an incentive until after coins dry up. However, a small amount of fees is healthy. 1000 satoshi/byte is not. As long as the transaction fee is > epsilon, where epsilon is an arbitrary constant >0, then it should be beneficial to the miners to include the transactions.

>I mean, with the increase in transactions due to the low-fees, the 32MB will eventually not be enough.

Eventually, yes. I'm a proponent of slow exponential blocksize growth

>If increased for example, to 1GB (pure speculation), how would it work?

The same way 1MB works? It would take years to reach 1GB, at which point if we have near-visa-level tx throughput, then the network has succeeded and there should be plenty of capital to put towards non-mining nodes and especially mining nodes.

(If non-mining nodes are such a centralization risk, BTC is fucked too. It's cheap to DDOS all the full nodes out there and substitute your own evil ones, as opposed to trying to acquire majority hashpower)"
This.
Oh? Where are you going to do your exchanging?
My interest in crypto-currencies is purely academic... at least for now.
This is great. The more the merrier.
"Are you advocating we limit the future global financial network because you don't want to spend  $185.99 on a 8TB hard drive that could accommodate 8MB blocks every 10 minutes for the next 20 years? 

If so sure let's keep the 1MB limit. "
"It's not useless, unless you make very small transactions. For transactions equivalent to $100K, the fees are acceptable, compared to the pain of transferring that amount of money to between banks.

Why do people don't just use gold as a currency in their daily lives? 
Because a 1 pound gold coin is worth more than £600. Good for high value transactions, not so good for low transactions...

I see Bitcoin as a high-value transaction currency, not a currency for the low value, like gold. "
"I prefer to look at crypto-currencies with a more practical and common view.
For example, I always try to look at from the point of view of someone who is not a computer-science person. 
I understand the terms, I understand *the thing*. But the common-folk doesn't.
I know for a fact that when I try to explain to a non-computer person what a blockchain fork is, their new question is  *""So, which one of the new coins shall I use?""*
This is indecision. 

A currency needs to have the capability to store value in the long term. Common folks like that. They like things which they can count on in the long term, especially if it's money. If common people have uncertainty about the future of a currency, its value gets affected and people get scared and cash-out to a more stable currency. This is real life with every other fiat-currency. 

> Now we have two relevant bitcoins, each squandering valuable resources on attacks 

I agree. Resources are being wasted.

Edit: I have edited to remove my comment regarding XMR, since I confused it with XRP (it's getting kinda difficult to know every currency symbol...)"
">> Sorry you got downvoted.

I don't pay attention to that. I'm not the type of person who receives their daily dose of incentives by micro-trophies :)

Shouldn't the increase of miners, reduce the amount of transaction fees?"
Serious questions: would the Winklevoss twins allow it? I am not clear on their stance with BCH.
Right now they're getting lots of business from people who think Coinbase betrayed Bitcoin by listing BCH. If Gemeni started listing BCH now, they'd lose all those customers. I don't think they're going to do anything to risk their new revenue stream.
I’ve got my money in Ethereum and Bitcoin on coin base. How can I put it into bth? Coinbase isn’t letting you buy bth. 
"> I don't currently transact bitcoins simply because there's nothing I can buy with then where I live.

Why did BTC adoption start going negative? You used to be able to use steam, bitpay, stampnik, etc. Now BTC is useless to transact with, since the fees are cost prohibitive."
"This is where we must disagree. In my opinion, the only sensible approach is to view forks as healthy. They are a natural part of open, decentralized software development (where did the term 'fork' come from?).

Soft vs hard fork is an arbitrary division. I get what it means, but is Segwit really ""soft"" if adoption is only at 10% or whatever level it's at? Right now Segwit looks like a minority soft fork.

Hard forks aren't scary, currencies like XMR do them all the time. You have to after a certain point to get things done.

The best way to activate hard forks is to choose an arbitrary future block to activate. This is in line with what Satoshi recommended.

Here, read this:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3rejl9/coinbase_ceo_brian_armstrong_bip_101_is_the_best/cwpglh6/

Note how Theymos actually was quite spot-on on what would happen. He thought that he could hold Bitcoin by the balls and censor opinions he didn't like, and as a result he forced a fork. Now we have two relevant bitcoins, each squandering valuable resources on attacks (personally I think the BTC side is conducting the majority of the 'attacks' but I try to avoid even going there due to all the panic about BCH being a pump-and-dump attack. I prefer to focus on the technology, which is what made me choose BCH)

So, why did/does Bitcoin Core spend so much time making hard forks out to be a Very Bad Thing? It's simple, they correctly saw that it would decrease the centralized grip they have/had on Bitcoin."

No but seriously, bitcoin legacy chain will stay as it is, valuable but useless for commerce, like gold.  It will be for speculators only (which I suppose is a use-case, sort of).

People mistrust Bitcoin. But not because of the current situation. They haven't heard anything about the current situation, and they've never had any coin of any sort. All we have to do is give people BCH so they can play with it, and then they can feel like they're inside-- and BTC can't do that. BTC went around yelling at merchants to take BTC, and they did, but then nobody went to any of those stores they HODLed instead. If we actually get places to add BCH and then actually go there that'll be the first time merchants actually make money on crypto and they'll love it.
Back in my day we used to have to transfer fees uphill both ways in the snow barefoot.

The have failed as coders and leaders. 
Uuh? 
Ethereum wasn't hyped because buterin. It was the tech. He became known afterwards.
BCH's new Cash Address format apparently will set it up to support the same anonymity Zcash offers
Delusional. Bitpay is not going to influence the value of bcash. The search interest has not fluctuated whatsoever since the announcement. 
"I'm with you ;) "
"90% of the alt-coin and ETH tokens are just like LN... works on paper, good promise, but nothing works. Show me ETH tokens that actually do what's on their whitepaper?  There will be a HUGE correction as promise works only for a times... usefulness is what matter. [Bitpay wrote on their blog that BCH will be soon integrated to pay product for as low at 1$](https://blog.bitpay.com/minimum-invoice-update/#whatsgoingtohappentosmallerbitcoinpayments) while BTC 100$ minimun... that will grab a HUGE market share of ""usefulness""."
"A bunch of code monkeys does not make a good currency. They are lacking understanding of economics.

When we've just had all this adoption from low income countries, pushing the fees up so none of them could afford it was just a ridiculous and fatal error. What do you think the user experience for the guy who makes $20 a week is? Is he speaking highly of Bitcoin? Is he happy?

Not to mention any amount of coin worth less than the fee amount becomes unspendable. Exchanges are saying that a large chunk of coins in their storage is now unmovable. So what are those coins worth?

And if you have Bitcoin that isn't worth anything, do you still count those in the market cap? Do they still add value to the currency?

Those devs are not thinking about economics *at all*."

Did you even read the title? How could it be on every exchange if it was just announced.
Why? Explain.
What did he do besides write for Bitcoin magazine?
That's the only thing they needed / their investors were interested in.
The only thing they have is the brand name.
I'm still going to upvote him because his point stands. To me it illustrates that bitcoin's biggest advantage right now is the first mover advantage. They've stagnated in almost every other way.
I bought ether in the pre-sale. Vitalik was well known prior to any ether code.
Maybe High Fee Coin Is Actually A Stupid Idea: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpskCdwc54o
I wouldn't buy in. That is for sure.
Why doesn't someone announce another fork of Bitcoin, but have it be exactly what Blockstream has or is moving toward and just call it something different?
Yeah sometimes a new coin is announced with client implementation complexity on the level of SegWit and then you usually hear that places aren't supporting it because of the extra effort before it quickly dies.
"BCH doesn't have to compete with other classical blockchain and BTC clones, because it blows them away by good functionality and low fees. If I'm to compare BCH with classical superheroes like Batman or Iron Man, his main opponents are neither Superman or Joker. These guys are thing of the past. 

BCH's main opponents are 

- The *new kids on the block*, the X-Men, Guardians of the Galaxy, and Harry Potter coins which doesn't waste power by mining, doesn't have the cumbersome blockchain tech, have instant transfers and zero fees. These kids are a serious contender to the throne, and only thing stopping them right now is that they're mostly unknown, don't have working mobile or desktop wallets, or aren't on main exchanges.

- The strange heroes such as Vertigo's Sandman, Lucifer Morningstar, or Motoko Kusanagi. These strange heroes represent the hidden and subtle world of fungible, anonymous coins such as Monero, Zcash and many others alike. They might be even more serious contender to the throne than the new kids because these strange coins offer *true cash* experience, fully untraceable exchange of value. What might hinder their advancement is that they are all based on old blockchain technology, so the scaling problems seen in BTC might be their doom too.
"
But Lightning!!!!
"It's true for literally any 0 days, brand new coin

However, it wouldn't have scalability issues, because it doesn't have scale (like BCH and any other alt-coin)"
It's bitcoin cash... Motherfucker.
Not true. A giant network effect and some part of $241 bln of wealth. Unfortunately, it's not over yet
network effect. if it had the mining power it currently does, it would quickly take top 5. If it was a new coin, it would die as an inferior to dogecoin.
Well with the fees so high up and transactions time that it takes sure it would be considered that.
The only merit it has currently is usd value advantage so take that away and yeah pretty much.
"lol, don't you know that you can't say anything positive anout BTC here?
Wondering what would happen if someone said ''if BCash was announced today ti would be also a shitcoin'' ajajaja"
What an utterly pointless pontification. It didn’t come out today, and has first mover advantage, which is why it’s where it is. 
BCH is also a total shitcoin if it came out today,
okay, let's see what happens when people actually see bitcoin cash popping up as a payment method
"But if BTC was announced today in its current form, it wouldn't have the mempool isues, because it wouldn't be as transacted as it is now... so it'd actually be amazing...

"
[No](https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/20/litecoin-charlie-lee-conflict-of-interest/).
it's got electrolytes 
"Missing the point how? It literally is a response to your ""Lol fuck the other team"" post. If I wanna *move funds*, LTC is better. If I wanna ""Suck the dick of the whitepaper at the expense of speed"", I'll try and find somewhere that uses BCH."
I agreed until the last two sentences, then I didn't care about your opinion anymore.
"If your intent is to inform uneducated newcomers, a different title would have been appropriate.  As an observer, this read as mudslinging. I threw in ""middle school drama"" intentionally.  The opinionated kid who always shares a negative opinion to smear another kid, in an attempt to put them down... As it turns out no one wants to be around this kid.  Yes this exist in bitcoin but as I mentioned it would be great to see the higher road taken.  Cheers"
I use bitcoin.tax to keep track of it, I believe it’s FIFO by default. It’s definitely messy if you’re doing anything more than trading.
The bank run needs to start on the exchanges itself, because people can't send there to sell.  So instead the buy side has to fall out on exchanges because everyone realise what a ponzi scheme BTC is.
"Same here. I was using Bitcoin for all sorts of minor things several years ago. About a dozen commercial transactions per month. Plus I would play around with different wallets and stuff. I like to experiment. As fees slowly went up, I stopped using it for these small things. I still thought BTC would be useful for larger commercial transactions though, so would still be a good store of value. I also stopped experimenting with wallets and stuff which means I was not keeping up with the technology. Tx prices went up some more and I stopped even using my own wallets. If someone wanted to send me BTC, I just gave them an exchange address. So now fees were discouraging me from controlling my own private keys. Occasionally, I would pay a few dollars to move from one exchange to another, but was still getting by with cripplecoin. When I paid a $15 fee, I knew it was high, but I wanted to make sure my tx was confirmed fairly fast. Wow, was I surprised. Checking the mempool and calcuating my tx size, I realized now that I should have paid about $35 to get confirmed within a few hours.

Eventually, I tried a double spend with much higher fees, but I couldn't get any of the networks to accept the pushtx. Guess I should have used the RBF flag, but my wallet doesn't do that, I would have needed to created a manual tx. I finally sent the other half creating a child pays for parent tx. Paid a total of $85 in fees to move her one input wallet to an exchange. I am converting them all now after seeing how bad it is. I have enough time locked coins with dates in the future and can easily restore her BTC half if I am wrong and BTC is the winner (which I doubt VERY much now).

And here I am an engineer that has made his own wallets, yet I still messed up. How is a regular person going to use Bitcoin Core? How are they suppose to allocate and reserve fees for future lightning transactions closures? Guess to low and they will have to do an extra transaction to pay an accelerator or do a child-pays-for-parent large fee transaction. Who is going to manage their own private keys when moving Bitcoins to your personal wallet costs you a days wages?

It has gone from bad to insane. Bitcoin Core is not Bitcoin anymore. It is some Frankenstein creation. I feel angry, sad, and disgusted. I will survive, but WTF."
No it was dumped. He tweeted that he sold it all.
Irrelevant and missing the point.  WTF do you support?  Western Union currently works better than Bitcoin and is more mainstream and adopted/accepted.  This isn’t a Western Union fan group.  
"Donated to the LTC foundation you mean? 

Don't spread misinformation please."
Serious Lee?
But Brawndo has what plants crave!
BCH with 0 confirmations, ETH once the Kitty fad fades.
I have to agree. Fighting fire with fire is hypocrisy.
"It is a bit like a cult of rage and jealousy isn't it? So much fury on one sub. If the coin was that great, everyone should be chill!

This place is a reflection of Ver himself, in a way. You feel dirty reading a lot of the drivel."
donated to whom?
"I said he donated his coins to the LTC foundation and you said no. Now you're saying you're right because he 'dumped' lmao

He donated his coins to the LTC like I said."
"The ""but Litecoin is decent"" statements are totally idiotic in this context, regardless of the truth or falsity of it.  Imagine a person whose daughter got shot by criminals.  And the criminals went and bought a bunch of Air Jordan shoes with the money in her purse.  You are like a person who says to the father ""What's the problem?  Air Jordans are pretty nice shoes.  I mean, they have cool colors and last a long time!""  I don't expect you to understand such a parallel."
All of it?
"That's dumb as fuck of him. If you sell then donate you have to pay tax, if you just donate you pay no tax.

I only saw the tweet where he said he sold. Where is the tweet where he says he donated?

Edit: Found the Reddit thread and he did sell then donate... Interesting strategy."
"He dumped. He dumped. He dumped. No amount of ""misconstrue"", ""out of context"", ""conflict of interest"" or whatever excuses you can come up with can change that fact. **He dumped**."
Kitty fad?
Jeeze dude. Why the vitriol? Any chance of a polite discussion. Litecoin is fast and works.
It's the Dapp that clogging the ETH network.
But noone can ever prove he sold them. 
then that settles it!
He said he sold and donated it. Stop spreading bullshit.
Sure, link to an article that misconstrues the whole thing rather than the reddit post. GJ.
Read the thesis of this post.  That's the point your missing.  Hurr durr stick a coat hanger up your nose.
I did. Litecoin and Bitcoin have always been buddy buddy. Sorry though, I didnt realize your circle jerk couldn't handle criticism. All hail the whitepaper.
unfortunately all coin subs are like this, not just btc
Even so, the money you put into the new coin goes as a cost to be deducted out of your capital gains. The math should work out if you only tax your absolute gains when turning into dollars.
"Combating false narratives has become a NEED for this community, because people are being purposefully misled and lied to amass. People need to be told the truth.

If you're constantly being slandered and attacked, but you never retort or defend yourself, that doesn't help the situation - especially when people are starting to BELIEVE the FUD being spread (and they are, I see it in Social Media groups all the time)."

"This makes me so angry. I got banned for pushing alt coins and all I said was we should understand both sides. 

And now they promote Litecoin nonstop "
"As someone relatively new to cryptocurrencies WTF is the point of a litecoin? Seriously?

At first I was confused by hearing ""Silver to Bitcoin's Gold"" since it makes absolutely no sense when worded like that. After researching I later learned it was referring to the way people minted coins out of silver, as gold was too precious for use as a currency.

So after some research I hear the founder Charlie Lee spewing the same zealot nonsense maximalist spew. Constantly FUD'n altcoins ect. but dude, you are pumping a fucking altcoin yourself. It's best (and only useful) feature is that it's listed on coinbase as it's not made any headway in merchant acceptance.

The contradictions continued as I learned Litecoin had no innovative features. It's basically the same thing as bitcoin x4, and used as a testnet for Segregated Witness, and will also test lightning networks before lightning is deployed on Bitcoin. So basically, if either of those scaling solutions are successful and make Bitcoin Core usable again, in the best case scenario Litecoin will be made obsolete.

Scenario 2, (more plausible) After reading about how lightning network will work, it's hot garbage. Literal dumpster fire that was sparked by a bolt of altcoin envy. Nobody will put down a deposit just to be able to use what should be a ""trustless"" payment network. Besides, you'll probably have a better chance of merchants accepting cryptocat sperm by the time Segregated Witness, and Lightning are ready to be FULLY deployed.  If they wanted to make an altcoin, they should have just made one. Bitcoin was cool in my opinion because of it's secure simplicity. Your average math student could learn to hash it out with a calculator and pencil. That's beautiful.

Maybe I'm missing something here because I'm not part of the cult, and drinking the same koolaid the Maximalists have been during the rise of altcoins. As far as I can guess, LTC is practically worthless moving forward. I'd rather invest in Dogecoin. I bet Charlie Lee had a moment of clarity and secretly traded it for BCH, giving up your HODL when you're the founder to be able to argue online better makes no sense."

"I just posted a comment that people need to stop blaming Roger Ver for the current Bitcoin problems.  He gave plenty of warning that if Segwit 2X fails, then he's putting it all into Bitcoin Cash.

First comment I get:  ""You should be banned!""

WTF?"
"/r/btc forever: ""We haven't anything good to say about ourselves so let's try to trash the competition!"""
To be fair LTC has faster confirmations and is more widely adopted/accepted, especially on more mainstream sites/exchanges. It's what I've been using on Bitfinex and GDAX. And I'm saying this even though I hold much more BCH than LTC.
Hey u/theiflar can you fucking unban me now you hypocrite? Altcoin discussion is allowed now on r/bitcoin apparently you imbecile.
Just got banned from r/bitcoin I assume that's a pretty common event around here ? Lol. 
">Now they are recommending people use ... literal altcoins

same thing with this sub, this post pointing out hypocrisy is also hypocritical. "
Let's face it. Charlie Lee is the smartest among us. He sold everything into fiat and will be looking to buy back in the current dip.
I disagree, pointing out the hipocracy and/or unabiding by their own rules informs users that sub is garbage.
You BCash supporters are going to loose in the long run. Grabbing my popcorn and watching.
"Don't forget that they [love to talk about Ethereum](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/search?q=ethereum&sort=top&restrict_sr=on), but only ever to say negative things.

Nasty cockroaches, the lot of em."
Rather than direct Lee control
...and was recently dumped by their founder. 
Inb4 they transform Litecoin into a 2nd layer network.
Look at litecoin github commit history. They follow upstream branch with few of their changes so yes its basicly copy paste testnet
so what altcoin can actually be ideally used for normie transactions? 
"Just use SegShit. and LN...oh wait....

Why are you selling anyway!??1111 Just HODL, we're being ATTACKED.

Money is invisible until it stops to work. Marks, dollars or BTC
I wonder if the continued high price if BTC represents in part just that a lot of people are already trapped there. And the bank run hasn't even started yet in earnest.
Why are you spamming the network with your 15$ fee?
He did at one stage almost stand up to Core, but they must have gently per$uaded him to be $ympathetic to their cau$e $omehow.
How does the IRS decide the cost basis for either side of the transaction?
I think him selling his LTC in the first place is a bad strategy that will only spread FUD rather than mitigate it like he wanted to. Definitely an interesting strategy. But I do believe that he is more or less good natured- at least to LTC.
BCH just got adopted by Coinbase. That's pretty big for adoption.
No! Use the US dollar if you need to transact.  Use bitcoin if you care about future wealth.  Use Bcash for nothing.
He donated all his mined coins to the LTC foundation.
