"Talks about BCH have been cleared because the reddit is dedicated to Bitcoin, not Bitcoin Cash.  There is no such moderation happening in /r/btc because one of the moderators has business interests in BCH and uses the channel to market those services.  /r/btc actually censors topics that expose the cognitive dissonance of the subreddit's focus on BCH instead of BTC.  Guys like you then attack people who point it out like youve been doing over the last day.

If you want to talk about all cryptocurrencies, do it in /r/cryptocurrency or /r/cryptocurrencytrading which covers bitcoin and all alt coins.

If I went into /r/nbalive to talk about NBA2k, theyd bump those comments too.  Ya know why?  They dont belong there in the first place.  It's off topic.

The fact is /r/BTC should be focused on BTC, not BCH.  You certainly should not be misleading people by confusing BCH and BTC and selling services that focus on BCH in a subreddit named BTC.

Core is a group of developers programming the original bitcoin client.  It's not a bunch of private business owners with their own financial interests like BCH.  The market and the rest of the community have called BTC the legacy Bitcoin chain but its you guys in /r/BTC selling BCH that make the community look shady and scammy.

I dont care that you support BCH.  I own some myself.  What I care about is using /r/BTC to do it.  /r/BTC should be about BTC, not BCH.  Whats happening in that subreddit is fraud.  BCH should be in a subreddit about BCH not hijacking the subreddit for BTC."

"Yes, the central claim of the paper is that when this inevitably happens, Bitcoin is not stable *unless* there is a continual backlog of transactions (with accompanying fees) waiting to be processed. Without such a backlog, the rational (most profitable) mining strategy becomes to ""re-mine"" any block that managed to capture meaningful fees, *rather than building on top of it and extending the chain*.

In other words, when the block reward diminishes to a small enough value (**which is 100% inevitable by design**), it stops providing sufficient incentives to reliably grow the blockchain. Satoshi's answer to this problem was ""transaction fees will provide this incentive"" but the paper demonstrated that they can only reliably do so if *the mempool regularly contains a backlog of pending transactions with meaningful fees attached*.

I recommend actually reading the paper, rather than just glancing through it. It is a seminal work. "
"It started as people simply proposing ways to upgrade Bitcoin; it only became a fork much later when it became clear Core would not allow Bitcoin to be upgraded."
"Core has allowed upgrades.  They just didnt allow the upgrades the BCH crowd argued for.  So they went ahead with the fork and the markets and community didnt support their alt coin.  It failed on the open market and the rest of the community didnt have faith in it either.

Roger Ver is a convicted criminal.
OK sounds like you have it all worked out. So you know about Bitcoin Cash, that's good, sounds like it suits your idea of what Bitcoin should be. There are many different scaling proposals and they all have drawbacks and downsides. Bigger blocks is just one. I don't know better than Bitcoin's developers. If you think you do, that's just incredibly arrogant, but you might be right. We'll see. All the best.
"I am not exactly sure what ""artificially high fees"" means, or how we could define ""artificial"" objectively in that context, so... no, I am not trying to argue that.

The paper shows that a backlog of pending, fee-paying transactions in the mempool is a sign of *health* in the Bitcoin network.

Bitcoin works because of how the economic incentives are aligned. Miners' greed allows the network to function autonomously. It would be wonderful if we could achieve everything that Bitcoin achieves through sheer altruism, but that's not a realistic assumption to rely upon, unfortunately.

I apologize for assuming you hadn't read the paper, your comments and responses so far led me to that (apparently mistaken) impression. Thank you for correcting me."

Isn't BCH the original plan of Bitcoin before Blockstream? This is what I thought based on my past experiences with Bitcoin pre-blockstream. 

I read the article. Man that is a fast article following what happened today. It is informative and eye opening if true. I have to take a step back and do some research before I take in believe what it say. I do have to ask this though, near the end it says:

> Oh no, I’m losing an argument. Look over there CENSORSHIP!

the article implying that BigBlockers do this. I can only say that this is half-true as I have yet to see a solid argument for SmallBlocks. This is what I was asking you and my conclusion down below. If it is a simple argument and you can post the details real quickly then you would save me some hassle, but ayways...


>You are asking me a question that had months of debate and the outcome was a split with both sides thinking their truth is the truth. I don't think I can convince you in post while months of debate on both subs failed....

How is Bitcoin Core censorship resistant if poor people get all their transactions censored?
"> I've never said any of these things.

I think he's saying his actions are not within what would be expected of someone that is simply a neutral moderator.
I think you're misrepresenting the point. In general, one cannot discuss the censorship by /r/bitcoin on /r/bitcoin without your posts being grey listed, along with various other topics (it even happened to me today). One example of a post containing the word does not disprove that.
"If you are serious about disclosing internal moderation policies (which you almost certainly are not), you could open up the mod logs as a first step.

And maybe you can't.

"People ridiculously dirt poor typically a) don't have money to be sending around all willy nilly.... duh, and b) most likely don't have the technology access for transactions with any sort of frequency anyway... duh.

How does this work? I know of bitcoin but how does this work with that? Does it keep a balance of money and you can tip people with it?

Why does poor automatically mean 3rd world to you? Why doesn't it mean people in developing countries that transfer money regularly to and from developed countries?

That is very interesting. BTC is heavily censored but you say it is against that?
Bitcoin Cash is **a** Bitcoin, just like Bitcoin Core. Bitcoin Cash is more Bitcoin than Bitcoin Core though.
Again, I don't deny Core's propaganda efforts have been quite effective.
">Your argument says nothing about the current case, when mining rewards don't have to be dominated by transaction fees.

About 80% of **all BTC that will ever exist** have already been mined. When do you believe the transition to a fee-centric paradigm should begin, at what rate should the transition occur, and do you have any formal academic analysis to support your reasoning?

I am happy to hear out any long-term plans that people have in mind, but in my experience they usually don't have *any* other than ""Let's just think of the short term for now, and cross the other bridges as they come!"" If you are the exception, if you've put actual thought into this and have meaningful arguments for what you think the timetables should look like on how this all plays out, I'm all ears. I suspect this isn't the case, though.

I really, **really** recommend reading [The Hardest Logic Puzzle In The World](https://xkcd.com/solution.html) and spending a good amount of time making sure you understand the answer and why it is the answer. I promise that it is not irrelevant to our discussion here, and you don't have to do it right now or anything.

Efficient markets (at least should) work like the logicians in that puzzle, in that *if* something will be worth a certain value at a certain point in the future, and this can be known (and demonstrated) with certainty, the price will converge on that value *in the present*. Or, to be more accurate, the price will converge on a value in the present which reflects that future value after you factor in the time value of money (but that's not particularly important for the point at hand). This means that *if* Bitcoin would suddenly stop working in 2140, and the whole thing breaks down, and we can logically realize this today, then its value should go to zero *starting now*.

That's why it was important for Satoshi to specify an incentive that exists even when the coinbase rewards vanish (or drop to negligible levels): transaction fees. It is an elegant solution, and seems to give us a means for Bitcoin to continue working for as far as you care to extrapolate forward (at least, *a priori*).

So you can't simply say ""We have the block rewards now, let's not worry about fees while they are still 'pretty big' because we don't have to."" We *do* have to. And we're rapidly approaching the point where big block rewards are no longer a given.

>Bitcoin has the power to change that.

I'm the most optimistic person I know, and I certainly hope you're right, but ""Don't worry, Bitcoin is magic!"" isn't a good enough argument to convince most people or convince the market.

I'm not trying to make a strawman argument here, by the way. It really does seem like you're saying ""Bitcoin has powers we don't understand."" It's an argument based on an appeal to magic, as far as I can see.

>Whenever people make the argument that ""this cannot work because it requires people to not act selfishly"" or similar, it implies 1 of 2 things: 1) a defeatist attitude about the inherent goodness of man or 2) they themselves want to act selfishly. Which of these are you?

I think this is a false dichotomy, but if you force me to choose, I choose 1. 

Bitcoin is built so that it survives *even in adversarial conditions*, and it achieves this by relying on the inherent greed of Man. That's the beauty of it, in fact. Once you start trying to remove this quality of it, you are *trying to weaken Bitcoin* and effectively trying to reduce it from antifragile to fragile.

I, for one, will oppose that effort with all of my might. "

"That was *not* actually the point in the OP. The point here was actually that this *never* happens in /r/Bitcoin, and that they have *never* seen a *single* instance of a comment being allowed which contained such a word. Therefore, when they saw a visible comment containing that word in the analyzed thread, they concluded that the only possible explanation for this was a carefully orchestrated malicious false flag campaign by the moderators.

I have explained that *not only do other examples exist* (and provided a quick example *off the top of my head* to prove this), but that *there is another explanation that OP very deliberately neglected to consider*, which is that approved submitters (like 4n4n4) are not caught in any filters by default. They even go on to discuss that *they know 4n4n4 is an approved submitter*, many paragraphs later, which contradicts the claim made in their first paragraph.

It does not seem that you have understood the arguments in the OP nor the refutations that I have made. Do you appreciate the contradiction that I am pointing out?

Interesting, but not terribly surprising. This is not something most people in this subreddit want to hear, I'd imagine.

I never actually ran BIP148 software myself, mainly because I didn't think my doing so was ever going to have a meaningful impact. I did root for the movement (mostly silently), though, and the most ""extreme"" my support ever got was chiming in to a couple of reddit arguments to point out the continual successes of flag-day SegWit soft-fork activations (a la BIP148) in coins like Vertcoin and Litecoin, and ridiculing misunderstandings regarding the conflation of ""the backing of the economic majority"" with ""total UASF-signaling node count"" (which I always considered a particularly stupid strawman argument).

OP's a core developer so I'm sure he's not talking shit. Anyway, Bitcoin is a high fee environment at the moment because transactions are happening on-chain and the block-size is limited. OP was saying it's not a technical problem if the mempool is huge, he wasn't talking about it not being an attribute to high fees. The plan to scale bitcoin is to kick payments up a layer or two. If you are using bitcoin for payments on the blockchain level (your only option at the moment) then I agree, fees are two high for it to be practical for low payments. Also blocks take on average 10 minutes to confirm. It's a pretty slow and shitty payment system if you have to wait 10 minutes. Sometimes a lot more. Come back in a year or three when some new layers are rolled out, they ought to be instant and practically free. For now bitcoin is a good but highly experimental store of value. It's a long way from being in a finished state. It's still in BETA.
You shouldn't believe everything you read. There is absolutely zero evidence of that.
