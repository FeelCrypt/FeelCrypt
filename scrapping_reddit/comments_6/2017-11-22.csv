This is yet another example of why I moved some of my most valuable chips to the BCH side of the table. Here in r/btc we get intelligent conversation, sharp research and intellectual honesty while r/bitcoin censors anyone who doesn’t wave childish pro core meme-flags and give Thymos a Nazi kiss ass salute. 
"The only one serving propaganda is you and the moderators in /r/BTC.  The rest of the world is trading BTC as Bitcoin.  The development community is supporting BTC as Bitcoin.  You're the one trying to create a false reality where BCH is the ""real"" bitcoin despite it springing into creation in August of this year in complete contradiction to the rest of the world, the development community, the larger crypto community and the markets.

You're hopeless and you have been exposed as a willing propagandist for BCH.  You are the one creating false propaganda and scamming new users through misrepresentation and lies."
Good bot
"Again, the original Bitcoin doesn't exist anymore; Bitcoin Core may have stolen the name and have been running quite an effective propaganda effort, but Bitcoin Cash is still closer to the original Bitcoin."
"The market did not steal the name.  The only people trying to steal the name are guys like you purposely confusing BCH as Bitcoin in a subreddit named BTC.

Bitcoin Cash is an altcoin and not the original Bitcoin.  That's a subjective philosophical discussion based completely on opinion that should be had in a sub named BCH or BitcoinCash not a sub named BTC.  The rest of the world, the markets and the larger community all call BTC the original Bitcoin and there is no evidence there was a propaganda effort behind it, the only evidence of a propaganda campaign is the guys like you confusing what BCH really is through Bitcoin.com and /r/BTC."
Yup. On the other hand, if it was not a picture of Greg Maxwells signature neckbeard, and posted shortly after I requested it, I'd take that as evidence toward it not being Greg. I doubt highly that Greg would be capable of asking someone else to agree to pose for such a ridiculous picture on such short notice. Again, this wouldn't be proof of innocence, just more reason to doubt this is Greg. If you wouldn't find that helpful, then feel free to keep your skepticism. I'm not trying to convince you of anything.
The community and markets decided before the hard fork that the legacy chain of Bitcoin would retain the name BTC.  There was no propaganda.
It can be argued that Core is misrepresenting Bitcoin Core as Bitcoin.
If r/bitcoin gets banned they will all come flooding to r/btc 
"Besides being the ticker for Bitcoin Core, ""btc"" is also an abbreviation for Bitcoin.

I don't see you complaining about people shilling for Bitcoin Core in the sub for Bitcoin. They shouldn't shill for Bitcoin Core on a sub for Bitcoin, they should do it in a sub for Bitcoin Core."
Someone should let the reddit admins know about this. 
List of banned Bitcoin ceos please?
Name of private company?
Well, if it was clearly a picture of Greg Maxwells neckbeard, I think we could count that as more evidence it's him, wouldn't you agree?
"Philosophically that may be the case.  In reality it's still BCH not BTC.   

Purposely misrepresenting BCH as Bitcoin in a subreddit called BTC, while pitching services that sell BCH is FRAUD."
I'm an approved submitter on r/bitcoin. I'm a nobody. I guess my posts kept triggering the auto moderator and mods got sick of having to manually approve my posts all the time. I would not be surprised if that is standard practice.
"> So it doesn't look good for you, friend of Greg.

OMG, I can't even comprehend how sane people can be indoctrinated this fast by only frequenting a subreddit.

You just make assumptions over assumptions to suit your theory, and I'm now fully part of the big Greg/Blockstream takeover non-sense? All this because I posted a reply and you bent it enough to make it look like a proof to you.

Wow... That was fast."
"Hey, thanks for doing this--almost all your postulations about me are correct. I'll just add a couple things:

> 4n4n4 seems to have a deep knowledge of Bitcoin on a technical level

Ha! I wish. I do try to follow and understand development to the best of my ability, but it's very much not my area of expertise so I'm always in over my head with the really technical stuff. From time to time I'll do a little code-digging to look for simple stuff that I can understand (for example, like how [MAX_BLOCK_SIZE is no longer part of the Bitcoin consensus rules](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/consensus/consensus.h)), but largely I can only try to analyze and explain ideas, rather than actual code.

> Just like nullc, 4n4n4 liked BIP148 but did not ""support"" or ""endorse"" it.

A bit of trivia: To my recollection, one of my comments explicitly linking to a UASF build was one of if not the only comment I've had moderated in rbitcoin. I didn't fight it because it's not incorrect to say that BIP148 significantly diverged from Bitcoin's consensus rules (though ended up staying fully compatible), but since it was removed, maybe my support isn't as obvious in my posting history. At that point I also started chilling in the #uasf dragon's den super top secret slack channel, so most of my UASF-talk moved elsewhere. The whole truth of the matter is I agreed with nullc about BIP149 being a much safer deployment mechanism (and I still do and look forward to BIP8's use in future deployments), but with the steam that was gathering behind BIP148 I made the decision to run with it and take the risk, which he did not."
So u/4n4n4 categorically denies they are u/nullc. If u/4n4n4 then posted a pic of Greg Maxwells neckbeard with their username on it to prove they are not Greg Maxwell that would either be 1) Homer Simpson level idiotic. Or 2) an epic troll to show how stupid this whole thing is.
"
>Seems to know an awful lot about nullc's life.

I know both of those things, too. So do you. Neither of us are Gregory Maxwell, and *once again* this is explained by the fact that 4n4n4 obviously follows the space closely.

These things are not secret. I suspect that the facts mentioned in both of these links are already well known by *most people posting in this thread*.

>Used the phrase ""Bitcoin's creator"", a major nullc trait previously documented

Please *actually look at the context he used that phrase in*. Saying ""Satoshi"" in that sentence *would not work*. It would have read: ""lmfao are you serious? Satoshi is on the other side? ... It's possible he believes that scamtoshi is Satoshi :("" which would have been a *very* awkward phrasing. I myself probably would have said ""It's possible he believes that scamtoshi *actually created Bitcoin*"" but ""is Bitcoin's creator"" feels just as natural there. In any case, saying ""scamtoshi is Satoshi"" when the quote from the comment above itself leaves off on ""Satoshi"" would have been a *lot* of ""xtoshi""s in a row, which most halfway-decent writers would shy from because *it doesn't sound right* due to being *horribly redundant*.

This is a painfully blatant stretch. If he had lots of documented cases of saying ""Bitcoin's creator"" in place of ""Satoshi"" or ""Satoshi Nakamoto"" this might hold *some* water, but in this context, it simply doesn't.

>Talks about nullc. A lot.

By that logic, **everyone on /r/btc is a sockpuppet of nullc's**. Everyone here talks about him *far more* than 4n4n4 seems to.

Furthermore, this is *once again* explained by the fact that 4n4n4 is subscribed to the mailing list (where Maxwell is quite active), and seems to keep up-to-date with developments in the space. Once again, the argument that *I am Gregory Maxwell* has *just as much evidence* as the claim that 4n4n4 is.


>Somehow knows who is working on what within Blockstream.

**Are you joking?!** The comments you linked to *explicitly quote Gregory Maxwell as a source*. Please, anyone reading this, click the links in question. The first one says: ""**I don't know their profit model** and neither do you. **Greg has denied** that Lightning plays a significant role in their plans--beyond perhaps being very beneficial for Bitcoin in general--and their allocation of, **in his words**, 1.5 people to development of Lightning **doesn't seem to suggest** that it's especially important to them.""

If anything, this comment indicates **strongly** that 4n4n4 *does not have special knowledge of the internals of Blockstream*. The second link reiterates what is said in the first (and contains **no** extra information about Blockstream). 

The fact that you tried to spin these links as ""Somehow knows who is working on what within Blockstream"" is one of the most disingenuous phrasings of your entire post (and as I've been showing, you have been phrasing things horrendously disingenously throughout). You are clearly *deliberately trying to mislead readers* with how you're presenting these links. Saying he ""somehow knows"" these things clearly implies that it is secret, privileged information, when in fact the comment itself explains that *he is quoting Maxwell directly* which explains *exactly* how he knows what he knows.

>And even responded directly to nullc in support of a claim nullc had made multiple times within that thread

You just linked to a comment corroborating what nullc had said. In fact, it starts with ""Can confirm"" which is a common way for someone on reddit to chime in and say ""Yes, what the person above me is saying is true."" 

This is exactly something you would expect a technically-inclined user to contribute to a thread like that, if they had firsthand experience that confirmed what Maxwell was claiming. This, *yet again*, seems to serve as evidence *against* the hypothesis that this user is controlled by nullc.

Beyond that, [external analytical tools indicate that 4n4n4 is **UNLIKELY** to be a sockpuppet of nullc's](https://83m6a1f16h.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/redditsockdetector/dectect/nullc/4n4n4), and *if* it is a sockpuppet, then Maxwell was careful enough to have made comments with both different accounts *within 2 seconds of one another*. This is a theory which requires an *extraordinary* suspension of disbelief to entertain.

Finally, [/u/4n4n4 has explicitly denied this allegation](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7eil12/evidence_that_the_mods_of_rbitcoin_may_have_been/dq5nijs/), saying: ""I've followed Maxwell's posts on BCT and here since a while before I made this account because I like to learn from people who know their shit."" This is exactly what I have been arguing is the most likely explanation of the similarities you have tried to paint in such a sinister light. Again, by the same token, I can equally well be accused of being a sockpuppet of nullc's, because I, too, like to learn from people who ""know their shit"" (and there are many others like me).

>After the massive amount of research we put into this, we believe that at least one moderator of /r/Bitcoin must have been either aware of the bot's plans (and allowed it to place blame on others), or have executed the attack themselves.

After the massive amount of effort you put into this, at least one moderator of /r/Bitcoin (namely, me) believes that *you were complicit in the attack in question* and that *this post itself is part of it* (and perhaps was the end-game all along). Your conclusion that /r/Bitcoin moderators were somehow involved has been *thoroughly* debunked here, and I believe that I have done an excellent job in demonstrating that you have *no* actual evidence in favor of that hypothesis. You've simply phrased things to *imply* that this is the case, without ever actually providing *any* evidence of it.

>This is most likely the moderator who immediately approved the [CU-1] comment.

You are specifically accusing StopAndDecrypt here. /u/StopAndDecrypt, did you orchestrate (or were you involved with) the vote-brigading mentioned in this post? I do not believe that they were.

>Other moderators may or may not have been involved. Meaning, yes, we believe that a moderator of /r/Bitcoin either directed or was complicit in the hacking of many of their own Bitcoin Reddit user accounts.

This is unbelievably scummy of you, *especially* if you are the actual perpetrator. Shame on you. **Shame on you.**

>We believe that it is likely that /u/4n4n4 aka /u/nullc was also aware of or involved in this attack based upon the suspicious timing and similarities of [CU-2].

There was no ""suspicious timing and similarities"" that I can see. I believe I have done well in demonstrating this, in fact. I will let the diligent readers in the audience decide if they agree with me on this matter.

>Some users reported that the IP addresses the bots logged in from were vultr instances and that vultr 1) requires tracable payment methods like credit cards, and 2) takes an aggressive stance against abuse of their systems, so perhaps more information can come to light about this yet. We encourage the Reddit admins to carefully review our claims and to validate them. If our claims here are true, surely some type of strong action is warranted. 

I sure do hope more information comes to light about this whole episode. I suspect that you actually hope the opposite, and I suspect that if you *were* actually complicit in the attack, that you (and any cohorts involved) were careful to avoid being outright detectable from an admin's perspective."

"Report it to the FBI cyber crime center.  Really easy just fill out the form.

"First step is to probably document what happened - save copies / screenshots of the reddit emails you got about resetting your PW, any pictures of votes or posts or comments you account made, and a picture of the IP's here that don't belong to you: https://www.reddit.com/account-activity

After that... Not sure.  A lawyer would need to make a case and subpoena them.  This can go into federal court since it almost certainly crossed state lines, which means the case means business.  The lack of monetary damage isn't much of a problem, it will still be enough to get the subpoena through and reveal who did this.  If it can be revealed, the FBI could arrest them for hacking systems(and might do so)."
How did you become aware you were hacked?
"Right, and if there are no public records of Greg revealing that information then 4n4n4 could have gotten the information from Greg privately.

If they had the same ip address, they might simply have been in the same building, or using the same vpn.

And so on."
"Seriously, when I first read that suggestion, that was my first thought. I realize there's obviously a gap in information between myself and all of you about my identity (obviously I'm pseudonymous here--and it seems for good reason!), but for myself and the close friends I have shared this incident with this actually is the most absurd ""is this real life?"" moment we've ever seen.

Just a hypothetical aside on the end here (since I think that I'm now rate-limited on this sub), but if nullc were to go to jail or otherwise be in a position where he obviously could not be posting and I kept going, would that change anyone's mind about our identities? Anyone with my login credentials would suffice as ""me"", since this handle is literally my whole identity in the Bitcoin space.

Fortunately for me, I'm not at much personal risk if people think that I'm nullc since they want to send the dogs after him, not knowing who I am. It's just... wow. You want to talk about fake news? Try being at the center of it some time--the view is spectacular. "
Nothing proves that the identity is a human or a bot, no matter which metric you come up with. You’d need a centralized authority such as a gov to make this call, or rely on pseudo-identity such as linked-in accounts.

Bitcoin Core is the original Bitcoin according to the community and the market.  Only the BCH shills are trying to argue that point in contradiction to the exchanges and people investing in Bitcoin.  None of this changes the fact Bitcoin is traded as BTC and Bitcoin Cash is traded as BCH.  You are one of many in this sub who continues to sow confusion and lies that BCH is Bitcoin in the BTC subreddit.  BCH is NOT BTC and it never will be, so quit perpetuating a lie that its the ""real"" bitcoin to people who are taking an interest in Bitcoin and join the BTC subreddit."

No, the /r/bitcoin sub was created before even the first Bitcoin-Qt client was created, so it existed before Core. Even /r/btc exists longer than the Core client."
Thanks
"Alright, I'll take a moment to look this over, if only to separate facts from speculation.

Here we go.

>When we first began looking at the massive downvoting attack as shown in BashCo's previously stickied thread last week, the first thing we noticed was that both of the bot-voted comments ( Image of #1, link to #2 ) would normally trigger our censorship notifier detection. Both ""censoring"" and ""censorship"" are trigger words we have found triggering automatic removal, something we later confirmed again. This would imply that either the comments were explicitly approved by the moderators at that time, or our understanding of the subreddit's policies needed updating. 

Actually, both /u/4n4n4 and /u/StopAndDecrypt have been approved submitters to /r/Bitcoin for 5 months or more. So no, neither comment needed to be manually approved by the moderators, and in fact, as a moderator of /r/Bitcoin, I can say for a fact that **neither comment was manually approved by a moderator of /r/Bitcoin**. This is a fact. 

So right there, your ""smoking gun"" (and your chief hypothesis) is out the window. Let's continue.

>The bots which were downvoting comments and posts on /r/Bitcoin and upvoting posts on /r/btc began their attack on 11/14/2017 at around 18:00 utc. A similar unusual pattern of voting appeared on /r/btc around the same time the day before, though less dramatically. The bots seemed to be pushing people to buy Bitcoin Cash in such a blatant way that it even left a bad taste in the mouths of Bitcoin Cash supporters. Both the attack the day before and the /r/Bitcoin bot voting attack on 11/14/2017 ended before or around 22:00 utc [REF-3]. The bots attacking /r/Bitcoin upvoted posts complaining about high fees and downvoted about 30 other /r/Bitcoin posts. At the same time they upvoted posts on /r/btc. We identified 65 comments downvoted by bots in /r/Bitcoin and 2 upvoted. The conclusions appeared to indicate that the bots were promoting Bitcoin Cash and /r/btc and harming /r/Bitcoin.

This is all true.

>We began investigating into the comments that caught our eye at first, referred to as [CU-1] and [CU-2] for short. [CU-1]'s content can be seen here as it originally looked. Immediately we noticed the next oddity - How were people able to see votes in /r/Bitcoin to discuss voting in the first place? /r/Bitcoin has blocked votes from being visible on comments during discussion for years. When did that change? We found that it changed right before [CU-1] was posted. BashCo stickied a comment stating they would ""pull back the curtains"" at 20:49, and archive.org confirmed that scores became visible between 20:32 utc and 20:50 utc. That, oddly enough, was just 13 minutes before [CU-1] was posted at 21:02:25.

So, to make sure the facts are straight here... the timeline here is that [this post](http://i.imgur.com/xrM39eb.png) was made, it was upvoted massively by a malicious bot army, [BashCo started a thread about it](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7cyj7o/i_just_got_257_downvotes_in_8_minutes_for_calling/) to call attention to it (and as you noted, [he temporarily enabled transparent vote-scores to highlight the attack](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7cyj7o/i_just_got_257_downvotes_in_8_minutes_for_calling/dptn609/)), and the attack continued from there. Then darwin2500 chimed in *to make fun of BashCo for pointing out the attack*, and was immediately upvoted massively (by the same malicious bot army, it would seem). It was approved by StopAndDecrypt a couple of minutes later (almost certainly because he was replying to the comment, and it was *yet another example of vote manipulation* that served to highlight what was being done and reinforce BashCo's valid points), and later deleted by darwin2500, the original submitter of the comment.

I don't see what you mean by ""oddly enough"", considering the entire episode was about *an ongoing vote manipulation campaign* that BashCo and StopAndDecrypt were calling attention to. In other words, none of the above seems to indicate *any* sort of foul play from *any* moderators of /r/Bitcoin *whatsoever*, but it seems like you are trying to imply that it does.

>We have determined that [CU-1] was indeed blocked by /r/Bitcoin's automoderator rules as we expected. The screenshot taken by /r/Bitcoin moderator StopAndDecrypt clearly shows this, as the ""moderator approved"" checkmark is present. We also tested automoderator rules with an aged account with karma and confirmed that ""censors"" and ""censoring"" were both blocked [REF-1]. Note that the poster, darwin2500 (under control of hacker, please don't ping them; they aren't a Bitcoiner) could not have been an ""approved submitter"" - they seem to have only had one comment in /r/Bitcoin before the hacking.

So you are aware of the ""approved submitter"" possibilities, and failed to even *mention* the possibility that either StopAndDecrypt or 4n4n4 were approved submitters in your very first paragraph when you said: ""Both ""censoring"" and ""censorship"" are trigger words we have found triggering automatic removal, something we later confirmed again. This would imply that either the comments were explicitly approved by the moderators at that time, or our understanding of the subreddit's policies needed updating.""? That in itself is rather telling.

Readers, I urge you to re-read my previous paragraph until you understand the point I am making very clearly. OP is *very* deliberately trying to ""spin a narrative"" here, not mentioning the possibility of certain comments being visible because they were made by approved submitters (which I can tell you for a fact is the truth) and instead pretending like the **only** possible explanation for the comment(s) being visible was that they were manually approved by /r/Bitcoin moderators (they were not), *even though they obviously know about approved submitters on reddit and discuss this later on in their post*.

>So why was the comment manually approved? 

As I said above, /u/StopAndDecrypt *was replying to the comment in question*, and was obviously *trying to highlight the vote manipulation that was going on*. You can't very well reply to a comment that isn't visible, and it is completely obvious why this comment was approved, when you look at the context it was made in and what was going on.

>We are not aware of any other approved or allowed comments that blatantly reference censorship like that in the last several months. 

There are **many**, but admitting this doesn't help the narrative that you are trying to spin. I remembered (off the top of my head) an instance from just a few days ago, and [dug it up for you as an example](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7dks5y/cut_the_bullshit/dpyif6k/).

So once again, this is more evidence that you're presenting information *incredibly* disingenuously. Comments that reference the alleged ""censorship"" of /r/Bitcoin are allowed all the time, even on a daily basis, despite the fact that they are off-topic and usually made by troll-armies just to stir up drama and mislead newcomers.

>Except this idea did not hold up. We found 10 similar comments from the same time period which were not approved or were explicitly removed unlike [CU-1]. Some of these were uncannily similar to the original comment. For example this one was submitted 8 minutes after [CU-1] and never approved. Another here supported neither subreddit and was blocked at 21:48 and never approved. This one accused /r/Bitcoin mods of being paid by Blockstream and was manually removed at ~22:35. A fourth was identical to [CU-2] and blocked at 00:12 and never approved. The same account of [CU-1] submitted a second comment 5 minutes after [CU-1] and was blocked and not approved. The other 5 things blocked or removed around the same time were: [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]. The existence or absence of most of these comments around the claimed time can be verified independently of the censorship_notifier, see [REF-2]

What on earth? How does this paragraph *in any way* indicate that ""this idea does not hold up""? 

Your argument in this paragraph seems to be: ""If you allow/approve *one comment* that is discussing 'censorship' in the subreddit (to highlight the vote brigading going on, then *you must also allow every single malicious comment made by every troll in the same thread!*"" 

How does that make any sense? The point of the thread was to point out how obviously vote-brigaded things were being, and how the discussion was being manipulated. Letting one or two example comments demonstrate the point is sane. **Letting the entire thread be overrun by trolls would not be!** 

The argument in this paragraph makes no sense! You say ""this idea did not hold up"" but it holds up perfectly. "
I've got a contact at a reasonably large agency. They've exposed Reddit manipulation before and been on the front page a few time. I've sent them this thread.
"It is not an opinion.  It is simply a fact.  

It's Bitcoin.  It trades under the symbol BTC.  Bitcoin Cash trades under the symbol BCH.  When people buy and sell BTC on the marketplace, they are buying Bitcoin.  Thats simply a fact.  This subreddit is named BTC not BCH so quit shilling for bitcoin cash.  Do it in a subreddit for BCH."

"In recent times, this site has been politicised to the extreme, and even subs like /r/cringe which have nothing to do with politics have become havens for left-leaning users and mods to promote their ideology, abandoning the original objectives of those subreddits. Take a look at the top posts of /r/cringe to see this in action. We have also seen many of the default subs bought out by political interest groups like ShareBlue and the result is that an impartial opinion on /r/politics, /r/news or /r/worldnews is now non-existent, they are all just echo-chambers. 

  We have mods that moderate hundreds or thousands of subs. We see people being banned from subreddits they have never visited just because of their participation in another sub. We see mods abuse power to ban users from multiple subreddits for one infraction, or with no infractions in some cases. Often these bans come with no explanation and questioning them leads to simply being muted (why does this option exist?). We see a multitude of censored comments in any thread about a remotely sensitive topic.  

  It is clear that the administrators are happy to let these abuses of power persist and happy to let the site become a hyper-politicised safe-zone for liberals. We've seen the site's algorithms changed to target one specific sub which doesn't go along with the narrative, /r/The_Donald, hiding posts from that sub from the front page even though they were happy to let /r/SandersForPresident take over the front page during the 2016 primaries. We also saw an astonishing action taken by the CEO of reddit, Steve Huffman, where /r/The_Donald's users' comments were personally shadow-edited by Steve himself in an act of petty retaliation for the criticism he received, which says a lot about the type of character he is.  

  Finally, the direction the site has been taking lately is very discouraging, as they aim to become a new Facebook. We are now seeing Facebook-like user profiles and a Facebook-like card-view homepage to go along with the Facebook-like quality of content that reddit has sank to, and it looks like the mission to turn reddit into another social media site is well underway, making this a great time to leave.  

  As an act of protest, I have chosen to redact all the comments I've ever made on reddit, overwriting them with this annoying message. I've had some gilded comments, made some funny jokes, given some good advice and started pointless arguments, but now they will all be turned into this, as I delete my profile and take back every comment.

"BTC is the ticker for Bitcoin.  This subreddit is called BTC.  Period.

BCH is not BTC.  You continuing to lie about his proves youre doing this to enrich yourself.  I know you're not this much of an idiot, you're choosing to be to perpetuate a lie that BCH is Bitcoin in a BTC subreddit.

The topics in Bitcoin are related to Bitcoin as its traded on the marketplace.  Bitcoin Core is the original Bitcoin.  Bitcoin Cash is an alt coin created by a fork of Bitcoin Core.  The Bitcoin subreddit has existed longer than BCH and was always focused on Bitcoin Core.  If you want to talk about and extol the virtues of BCH, do it in a subreddit dedicated to BCH not BTC.  All youre doing is confusing new users, making the entire community look bad and perpetuating the idea BCH is a scam."
Nailed it.
Me? What I'm doing is informing people about Bitcoin. Unlike what goes on at propaganda-central /r/bitcoin .
"You're MISINFORMING people about BCH being Bitcoin in a subreddit called BTC.

You're the propagandist here.  I'm simply asking for more transparency and honesty about the subject matter in the BTC subreddit."
Bitcoin Core is less Bitcoin than Bitcoin Cash is.
"That's the plan with politeia, the data is not stored on chain, but the backend is based on a git repository with dcrtime timestamps anchored in the decred blockchain.

This makes it possible to prove that no history was altered."
"> If you want to have philosophical discussions about BCH as **Bitcoin** do it in a subreddit for BCH not one meant to be about BTC.

So I'm not supposed to talk about Bitcoin in a Bitcoin sub?"
It's Bitcoin Cash, not Bitcoin.  Again, you clearly miss the point.
"> It's Bitcoin Cash, not Bitcoin.

That's up for discussion."

"As a relative newcomer to cryptocurrencies, but a veteran in business I would offer this:  The entire crypto market is 'small enough' for rogue agents to become market movers by influencing opinion in specific target platforms (like reddit).  

You can't come on reddit and affect the value of Ford Motor Co by blatantly claiming that their products are killing babies, because the overall investor base doesn't read reddit.  However, in a subset like crypto, you may actually be reaching (and subsequently influencing) a significant portion of the userbase via posting on reddit.

"
">Youre a bad liar and your arguments have become ridiculous.

Stop talking to the mirror while I'm talking to you."
"No, when it comes to trading it on a market, there is absolutely no discussion.

BTC should be about BTC, not BCH."
Yeah cool. To be honest I just found the whole thing a really funny concept. Some combo of Greg's enormous beard and chins in general as evidence, I don't know, seemed like a courthouse scene in a monty python sketch. Have a good day.
The reason I've been buying Bitcoin Cash instead of Bitcoin Core is precisely because Bitcoin Cash is more Bitcoin than Bitcoin Core. So, when it comes to trading, it definitely matters which one is more Bitcoin.
"Your arguments continue to get more desperate and pathetic.

/r/btc is not welcoming in the slightest.  They downvote anything that challenges the bullshit of calling BCH Bitcoin in a subreddit about BTC.  Even the OP says posts were astotured using bots to upvote and downvote, except you blamed /r/bitcoin without providing any evidence or motive and ignoring the fact those actions benefit nobody but the moderators of /r/BTC who own businesses selling BCH.

Youre a bad liar and your arguments have become ridiculous."
BTC is Bitcoin.  BCH is Bitcoin Cash.  This subreddit is /r/BTC.
No, /r/bitcoin largely about Bitcoin Core and against competing bitcoins. People posting about things that are in favor of the original Bitcoin and against Bitcoin Core get censored there, meanwhile Bitcoin Core propaganda is quite welcome, even when it's inconsistent with the original Bitcoin.
It is largely about bitcoin.  Now youre simply trying to deflect after going around in circles. There is no outright shilling for a different alt coin on /r/bitcoin, the moderators dont own any businesses that they promote like Ver does on /r/BTC.   The topic of conversation on /r/bitcoin is Bitcoin.  They dont talk about Bitcoin Cash because the topic isnt about Bitcoin Cash.  Bitcoin Cash should be talked about in a subreddit called BCH or BitcoinCash.
I don't see you complaining about /r/bitcoin not being about Bitcoin... I guess it's because you personally profit from that misrepresentation?
"No, I'm not.  Bitcoin Core is traded as Bitcoin with the ticker BTC, which is what this subreddit is named.  You are the one who is PURPOSELY MISINFORMING people to claim that BCH is Bitcoin in a subreddit called BTC.

My argument is very clear and straightforward:  The content in BTC should be about BTC.  Youre the one twisting yourself into a pretzel to make the argument BCH is Bitcoin in a subreddit named BTC because you will personally profit from that misrepresentation."
"not in US. 
"
By saying Bitcoin Core is Bitcoin, you're just as bad as you accuse me of being. But in fact, you're worse than I actually am, since I do acknowledge the original Bitcoin doesn't exist anymore and have stated Bitcoin Core is not the closest thing to the original Bitcoin we got.
"The markets call BTC Bitcoin.  Wikipedia calls BTC the ""original Bitcoin"".  The majority of the crypto community calls BTC the ""original Bitcoin"".  The only idiots that dont are right here on /r/BTC.  Idiots just like you."
Post a picture of your chin with your username on it so that we have reason to doubt you're Greg.
"What in my post history makes you think you're wasting your time?? 

You mentioned that bch won the war but I don't see how...can you elaborate on what you mean by this? 

I don't see the appeal of small blocks - I'm told that it is so everyone can run a node but what is the use in this? You think I'm not gonna get a biased answer from /btc? I want to hear both sides to educate myself. 

Edit: to be clear, I've asked what the use of small blocks are and I'm told that it is so everyone can run a node. I would hope there's more to it though, which is why I ask a supporter of smallBlocks/knows arguments of both sides."
"I think you're actually referring to thieflar's bizarre rant, which establishes nothing other than that thieflar denies the charges, while being unable to answer basic questions.

You see, if 4n4n4 is a nobody, then 4n4n4 would not be an approved submitter, able to bypass the auto-censorship.

Here is a comment from 4n4n4 from a few months back:

>2MB blocks is conservative enough that segwit alone is able to produce 2MB blocks--it doesn't need a further bump to do so. Though really, is a full doubling really that conservative? Driving twice as fast is hardly a small change, let alone four times as fast--and four times what we're doing today is what 2x is pushing for.

Now you will think that any gentleman lke yourself would say such a thing, but those of us familiar with Greg's arrogant and foolish style will recognize that this was written by Greg and not by somebody like yourself.

A normal person would not be confident enough to liken a doubling of bandwidth to driving twice as fast, because he would rightly fear ridicule since bandwidth has doubled many times and will continue to double, while maximum safe driving speeds have not doubled in the same way.

Only a supremely confident arrogant person like Greg would think that he can make an argument like that and be safe from ridicule. Greg, you see, has an inflated idea of his own intelligence and thinks everybody else is stupid. So he makes stupid arguments like this with ease while oozing arrogance, thinking everybody will be too stupid to see how ridiculous he is.

Anyway, if there is no reason for 4n4n4 to be granted approved submitter status then that is just as suspicious and incriminatory as manually approving the offending comment.

So it doesn't look good for you, friend of Greg."
Indeed, they have quite literally formed what is basically a crypto-mafia
LMFAO.
"This is what anarchy online looks like lol.  The people wanted it and that's what they got.  You can't have unmoderated completely free speech online and not end up with trolls and bigots. 

Unfortunately you can't have moderated communities and not end up with corruption apparently. "
"Presently yes, but not because the administration wants it that way.

The administration is deeply committed to free speech, but the communities with the most impetus to migrate have been the things reddit has banned.

Once /r/coontown was banned, a critical mass of a certain viewpoint took over and it became a circle jerk.

"No, the problem is a disproportional amount of people of a divisive group was attracted to it when it started, establishing a pattern that's hard to break. If it had started with a more diverse distribution of groups, or rather, if it had started with a significant percentage of more moderate and reasonable people; it would develop an image leading to a more sustainable growth of a diverse population.

Certain types of ideologies tend to push away differing ideologies, while others can promote diversity even with otherwise mutually incompatible groups (ironically, the most prominent group today claiming to be for diversity, the SJWs, are just as bad at it as the alt-right, if not worse)."

Bitcointalk has 1.3 million user accounts. I'm sure quite a few of them use the same username and password on Reddit. Who knows if they keep plain text copies of the passwords. Even if they don't it would be relatively trivial to run a dictionary attack on the hashed passwords.

I'll admit that I started using this term after seeing nullc use it, along with him making the point that *we don't know who created Bitcoin*, and using Satoshi implies a bunch of things that we really don't know. I probably have picked up a bunch of diction from reading stuff he has written, but I don't think that makes me him.

The first couple I noticed were things I might've upvoted on my own anyway (e.g. something about fees on /r/bitcoin) so at first it didn't seem too unusual and I didn't investigate further.

A little while later though I was suddenly locked out of my reddit account. When I tried to relogin I got a message about ""suspicious activity"" and was required to reset my password. I also received an email about this (twice actually).

After increasing the security on my account I check my account history to see what the suspicious activity was, which was when I noticed that it wasn't 2 or 3 posts that I misclicked to vote on, but rather dozens."
Fortunately I did indeed collect all evidence of what happened -- actually, when I posted originally that my account was hacked no one believed me so I posted it as proof. I don't exactly have funds for hiring a lawyer, so for now I'll just file the FBI report that another user mentioned.

I see you have also posted a thread in /r/bitcoin calling for ""refutation of the accusations"" of this thread (also structured as an insult). I see from the responses to your thread, no refutation is forthcoming:


Suggest you ignore comments  4

Disparaging comments 3

Acknowledgement comment (no refutation given) 2

Lack of response doesn't prove anything, but if he would have quickly provided a picture then I would have been convinced he's not Maxwell, so that would have been a little useful.

"weinstein had his hands up dresses.
nullc had his fingers in our pockets.
bad comparison jussayin...."
Now we are closer to : «It is on the internet, it may have been manipulated»
yeah, but why tesla motors?
That's a lot of subs. Someone really wants to spread this narrative.  Whatevs, BCH is still not Bitcoin. Never will be. 
That makes two of us.
"Right?! At first, I was kinda like... ""Duh. Isn't this the danger of an unregulated currency?"" Then I realized that this is more transparency and call to action than most scams ever see.  This community is pretty cool."
You should be concerned that a community of people who have tied up a lot of their money into bitcoins is being ran by really selfish and unethical people.
He also allows leftist SJWs so...

Wow, this comment feels really scripted.

I don't get it and that is way too much text for. I lose focus after the first paragraph (ADHD is awesome). Can anyone provide an TLDR?
"So the argument is that moderators approved a comment and then it started being attacked by downvotes, and therefore the mods must be behind those downvotes?

Could it be that the mods knew the pattern of the bot from experience, so picking the correct comment was trivial?

For example if your subreddit gets vote manupilated every day you start to understand what type of comments it happens to. Then you configure auto moderator to remove these comments and require manual approval. But then to show the manipulation you can just approve one, and voila the bots get to work.

So its sort of like having a lake full of piranhas, you know they are there but dont see them until you throw some meat into and it becomes a huge frenzy. "
Before we start demanding mod changes we should think about how the admins would choose a replacement. If they merely take the second in command or draw a random prolific rBitcoin commenter, it may not be an improvement. Auction would be interesting, probably generate at least a few tens of millions in funding.
Too late for that. They all stink to high heaven.
Actually - just click on his/her username. His/her profile shows he/she is definitely a moderator of this subbreddit. Fact. What is your agenda?
He's an /r/bitcoin mod. Shill is indeed an accurate tag!
">The comments and posts chosen for downvoting were all over the place. Many of the comments chosen for downvoting seems to have been simply ""because they were there in the thread"" - For example every single comment visible in before 20:50 was downvoted. BashCo was targeted more than any other user(8 comments), but the bot generally didn't seem to focus on specific users. The vast majority of comments downvoted(54/65) happened in the stickied post, with 6 more happening in the second upvoted post. The remaining 5 comments downvoted were scattered across 4 different posts [REF-3]. The bot specifically went after comments and posts talking about downvotes, the accounts hack, or the attack itself [REF-5] but they also downvoted neutral posts. The voting seemed to come almost exclusively in waves targeting one thing at a time, which made the bot votes obvious to anyone who was looking for them - which people were, since many posts targeted were about the downvotes.

This further strengthens my above hypothesis (that this was a blatant attack from entities **antagonistic to /r/Bitcoin**, rather than an elaborate false-flag orchestrated by /r/Bitcoin moderators). The attacker(s) may have been trying to collapse as many comments as possible, to further muddy the waters and make the conversation difficult for readers to digest. After all, their attack was being exposed rather clearly at the time. 

>We also noticed that an extremely high number of /r/Bitcoin and /r/btc users were reporting that they themselves were hacked and part of the bot attack. We identified 35 such users, but the highest number of votes seen on a single thing indicate between 250-300 accounts involved with the attack. Over 10% of the hacked users were Bitcoiners, what are the chances of that? Well, Reddit has (very) roughly 50 million accounts, and the CN database indicates that about ~50k are regular or semi-regular /r/Bitcoin and /r/btc users, which is 1/1000th. 35 / 300 of hacked users being regular Bitcoin users and feeling the need to post about it is > 1/10th. Whoever was running this bot seems to have intentionally chosen Bitcoin users - It seems like they wanted the hacked users to see the results of the hack.

Wait, what? That is a *non sequitur* (it does not follow). It seems much more likely that the attacker(s) wanted hacked users to be recognizable usernames in the venue-of-attack. Occam's Razor favors this explanation *heavily*, in fact.

And *even* if we go with your explanation, it once again seems like it might implicate *you* in this entire episode, more than anyone else. After all, look at how much work you've gone through here. Your entire account is dedicated to smearing /r/Bitcoin and its moderators (and in fact, you seem to go through *extraordinary* amounts of effort to do so); if **anyone** ""wanted the hacked users to see the results of the hack"" then you (and whoever else collaborates with you on this account and project) are prime suspect number one.

>The result of all of this was that many many people commented on the blatantness of the voting, with many of them suspicious as to why anyone would do such a blatant attack. More examples: [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9]. Amidst all of this there was one exception so subtle that we almost missed it - There were two posts voted on that ran completely contrary to the rest of the behavior of the bot. The first image showed upvotes on a pro-/r/Bitcoin post ""PSA: Attack on Bitcoin"" thread and a downvote for the anti-/r/Bitcoin ""awkward meme orgy"" /r/btc thread. At first we thought maybe this was a legitimate vote by this user mixed in with bot votes, but archive.org showed us that indeed that /r/btc thread got a sudden wave of downvotes in less than 23 minutes. Perhaps the bot forgot which side it was pushing for? But both changes were subtle and not noticed by any users as far as we can tell.

I am not quite sure what the accusation here is supposed to be (most likely this entire section is just supposed to be one big nebulous sinister-sounding implication), but I do have a question: how was archive.org being updated so frequently on these (relatively mundane) threads? Someone must have been submitting these pages for archival. Was it you? If not, do you know anything about it?

>The final thing the bot did as far as we have identified was to upvote [CU-2], and then the attack seems to have stopped suddenly. That comment wasn't upvoted until 21:55 - 22:05. So what about that comment? Why was that the only comment not under its own control upvoted, and why did the attack stop suddenly afterwards?

I have explained this above. It seems like the attacker(s) realized that they had been caught red-handed, and tried to ""change gears"" and obscure the attack. Again, this seems to incriminate /r/btc (and you yourself), and I fail to see *any* way that this incriminates any moderators (or supporters) of /r/Bitcoin. You have offered *no* explanation or rationale for this behavior (though, note that I *have*).


>The CN database gave us some hints. Both the [CU-2] and this comment were deleted by the user, likely when they took back control over their hacked account. [CU-1] was deleted at 21:23 +/- 1 minute, ~21 minutes after creation [REF-6], and not present in that snapshot. The votebot operator probably didn't expect this to happen so quickly. After that deletion there was no obvious comment showing their upvotes on the thread

At the time of the linked screenshot, there were no comments in the thread that fit with the narrative that the attacker was trying to support (most that would have fit the bill were likely caught in a filter). Note that there were **many** comments aggressively downvoted at the time, which perfectly demonstrated the ongoing attack (see Stallzy's -242 comment-score, for instance).

>It seems that they wanted a comment that wouldn't vanish, so not a hacked account, and also that they preferred a comment that could ultimately be used to make /r/btc look guilty.

What? That's quite the inductive leap you took there!

Again, Occam's Razor indicates that there were no massively-upvoted comments in the thread (other than the deleted one) because *no comments that fit the attacker's narrative were visible to be targeted at the time*. It wasn't until an approved submitter *tricked* the attacker when we got more evidence of *upvote* manipulation (though, it's important to note that there was *plenty* of extant evidence of *downvote* manipulation still visible in the thread at the time).

>4n4n4's comment [CU-2] provided exactly this, and it was posted to the thread ~5 minutes after [CU-1] was deleted - at 21:28. [CU-2] was never blocked by automoderator, it was picked up in the next CN scan ~1 minute later... Seemingly because 4n4n4 is an approved submitter.

Ah, so you *do* know that this is an approved submitter of /r/Bitcoin. And yet, **in your first paragraph you make no mention of this when you say: 'Both ""censoring"" and ""censorship"" are trigger words we have found triggering automatic removal, something we later confirmed again. This would imply that either the comments were explicitly approved by the moderators at that time, or our understanding of the subreddit's policies needed updating.'**

You're in such a rush to spin your narrative that you're contradicting yourself directly in a single post."
"I actually included 5 separate links (on 5 separate words). I was too stupid to realize they would all ""blur together"", though, looking like one big link. I'll go fix that."
"> Why is 4n4n4 an approved submitter?

Because it's a sockpuppet of Maxwell's.  ~~Note how /u/thieflar didn't deny this claim.~~edit: looks like he does argue against this in further replies. my bad."
"Yes, but such a person would not ""know who is working on what within Blockstream"" or have the other specialist knowledge indicated by the OP."
True that alt could have been an elaborated plan to discredit him. But still a part from the writing style you can clearly see it is him by how he answer on the comment chains... sometimes he directly forget to swtich back to u/nullc :p
"Yes blockchains can solve many issues, but this isn't one of them, unless you have a centralized authority that 'confirms' accounts are real. And as anything blockchain, a 'centralized authority' is exactly what they were meant to avoid. Point is, if you can't differentiate between a bot and a human, then your cryptographically proven identity proves nothing more than the fact that posts are from the same entity and were not forged; not whether or not you're dealing with a human or bot."
So why was it confirmed that ver took 50000 btc out of storage and moved onto the exchange to buy bcash during these events?   How does that fact line up with these theories?  He was clearly in on whatever happened too.  IMO this whole market is ripe for manipulation and all the big players are a part of it

>But the why wasn't the only oddity. [CU-1] was submitted, approved, upvoted, and screenshotted all in less than 180 seconds, as shown by its screenshot (""2 minutes"" rounds down on Reddit). That is an extremely short time for an automoderated comment to be approved based on what we have observed and in checking other subreddits open modlogs on approvals. Perhaps the moderators were very snappy about approving comments within this particular thread? Once again, this idea did not hold up. This comment appears to have been manually approved as it wasn't seen until the third scan after its supposed creation, ~11 minutes of delay. Perhaps only when the comment was a direct reply to BashCo? Still no - Here's a comment that was a direct reply to BashCo, but didn't show up in scans for 45 minutes. Here specifically the our data can be independently checked - This snapshot does not show the comment, but this one does.

This is *the exact same argument as above*, and makes just as much sense (namely, none). The comment in question was approved by StopAndDecrypt within a couple of minutes *because he was replying directly to it*, and because *it demonstrated the point that obvious vote manipulation was occurring extremely well*. The fact that other comments made by malicious attackers during the same time period were not similarly approved *in no way constitutes evidence of malfeasance*, and yet you're trying to (totally nonsensically) pretend like it does.

>Despite all the comments being blocked or removed as normal that we found, what we did not find was any other examples of anti-r/Bitcoin comments approved or allowed except the comments the bots upvoted. Three snapshots([1] [2] [3]) of the thread in question show no other strongly anti-r/Bitcoin comments present except [CU-1] and [CU-2]; Why did the moderators specifically allow [CU-1] and [CU-2] and nothing else? Perhaps they wanted to reveal the voting patterns, but then why only those comments? Further, by the time of [CU-1], the bot had not upvoted any comments at all. Why would the moderators assume that particular comment and no others would be upvoted, a mere 13 minutes after they ""pulled back the curtain?""

Again, this has already been explained above. Why would we want the thread exposing the vote manipulation to be overrun by the manipulators and sockpuppets in question? The demonstration comment/thread was *more than enough evidence to expose the foul play*, letting more antagonistic comments (intended solely to mislead newcomers) through would make *no sense* at all.

>The next thing we investigated was the behavior of the bots during the ""attack"". How many posts and comments did they downvote? How many did they upvote? What did they pick and were there any obvious correlations? We initially identified only two posts inside /r/Bitcoin that were upvoted by the bots - Both being posts about long delays on the OP's transaction confirmations. 

Did you also examine the vote patterns occurring in /r/btc during the same time period? I personally remember being *incredibly aggressively* downvoted (over a hundred times in a few minutes) *merely for asking not to be harassed*, during the exact same time period as what was happening above.

In other words, I know from firsthand experience that these two comments in /r/Bitcoin weren't the only things being vote brigaded at the time.

>The comments upvoted, too, were specifically chosen. Both comments upvoted were ones attacking /r/Bitcoin over censorship, and without any subtlety. Both comments were in the primary stickied thread with most of the comment downvotes. We quickly determined that the account that posted [CU-1] was under the control of the hacker, something other users also concluded. [CU-2] was posted by a clear /r/Bitcoin supporter based on history. Both comments used words that /r/Bitcoin's automod rules normally silently block [REF-1]. Other comments that subtly denigrated the subreddit's policies were noticed by the bot - but were downvoted instead of upvoted. Why?

It appears that the ""other comment"" (note: **singular**) in question is casting aspersion on /r/Bitcoin policies, and if I had to guess, I would say that it was downvoted because *the attacker(s) had been exposed*, and in fact, the [expository comment in question](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7cyj7o/i_just_got_257_downvotes_in_8_minutes_for_calling/dptpngb/) even ""goaded"" the attackers to try and make their comment score -200 rather than +215. Rather than ""giving him what he wanted"" (which would just serve to strengthen the point being made), it seems like the attacker(s) tried to ""muddy the waters"" by doing something that would be uncharacteristic of them to do...

In fact, the more I think about it, the more it seems to me that *you* may have been directly involved in this attack. If so, making this thread [is a bold strategy](https://youtu.be/9HVejEB5uVk?t=7), sir.

I don't understand what the counter-hypothesis is, honestly. It seems pretty obvious that whoever was behind the attack decided to downvote comments that one might expect them to upvote (note: *after* having been exposed by /u/BashCo), but if anything that seems to incriminate *this* subreddit, *not* /r/Bitcoin in any way."
You should edit your comment in r/bitcoin to start with [this link](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7eil12/evidence_that_the_mods_of_rbitcoin_may_have_been/dq5xrdi/). You currently link half way down the chain. 
"I'd also like to know what an ""approver submitter"" is. So there are submitters that are ""more equal than others"", besides the mods?"
"> There are many, but admitting this doesn't help the narrative that you are trying to spin. I remembered (off the top of my head) an instance from just a few days ago, and dug it up for you as an example.

This is not a very good example. That looked like a newb asking a question and you allowing the post so that you could bring them in to your world.

Meanwhile, I'm sure you won't deny that posts with the word ""censorship"" are generally automatically censored from /r/bitcoin (except for approved posters)? In the subreddit about a thing where the whole point is to be resistant to censorship? Do you see how insane that is?"
"> separate facts from speculation

There's a credibility issue here. Anti-censorship personas like censorship_notifier begin with high credibility. Pro-censorship personas like yours begin with essentially **no** credibility. So you will have to make a much, much better argument before you will be taken seriously.

If you are serious about disclosing internal moderation policies (which you almost certainly are not), you could open up the mod logs as a first step.

But I don't think you will.

And maybe you can't. You are at the **end** of the moderators list for /r\/Bitcoin (except for the last one, which appears to be a bot that posts only biolerplate text). Which means you are the juniormost. Any of the other moderators can take you off the list if they are displeased by your work. You cannot take any of them off the list.

Maybe you mostly make coffee for all the other people that moderate /r\/Bitcoin 24x7 in three shifts. And if you tried too hard to make them open up the mod logs, you would probably be quickly shown the door.

So I sympathize for your situation. Approximately the rank of a barista, but with lesser credibility."
Please make the mod log public then. If you really do not have anything to hide, this should be a non-issue right?

It's not his job to decide what is and isn't censored on subreddits, it's their own rules
My most usual mistake is putting the first letter of the next word at the end of the current one, but I usually catch it before (or shortly after) I submit the post. Pretty interesting stuff though. Isn't there someone in the btc community who uses double spaces or something?
Isn't this what this thread is about?

"If you consider the concept of using the blockchain as a decentralised public key server with limited storage capabilities, then it becomes trivial to tie identity to blockchain addresses. 

For example signing a message using your Twitter feed using the private key in the keypair above."
You're right, there is no comparison.  nullc has harmed millions more people.  
indeed yes, deleting stuff from other member
Too bad nobody here actually knows how to read code.  
I'm a bit surprised that a sub about a form of currency that relies on the internet doesn't have *one* net neutrality post on their front page today. 
Three of us! Well, mainly because I'm poor and live in Brazil, but that's the intention that counts, right?
"Are you for real?

The mods of r/bitcoin created bots to downvote their own posts and upvote posts on r/btc so they could place the blame on r/btc to make them look bad?

Since spez has shown us that some people edit the reddit database directly allowing changes without changelog, they could write code that automatically detect donation/crypto addresses and swap them for their own occasionally.
Are you saying they don't post a ton of stories they believe to be real news? most of their front page are 'news' stories that many of them legitimately agree with.

">Almost immediately after it did so, 4n4n4 screenshotted, archived, and edited the comment. And then the bot's voting attack instantly ceased as far as we can tell [REF-3] [REF-5].

*Yet again*, this seems easily explained by the fact that *4n4n4 caught the attackers red-handed and helped to expose them*. This is further corroborated by the strange up/downvote discrepancies mentioned above.

>The biggest indicator we found is that nullc has the very frequent pattern-- of writing--his sentences with two dashes separating words. This by itself is somewhat rare, though we confirmed that he uses it more times than anyone else in the CN database

That's not very good evidence, especially since your own database screenshot shows others who frequently do the same.

>But there were many more things we noticed. We found several examples of 4n4n4 picking up nullc's conversations and continuing them.

I have done the same, many times. He often stands alone against armies of trolls and ignorance, and since I commonly find him fighting the battles single-handedly, whenever I find an opportunity to help out and debunk whatever nonsense he's fighting against at the time with some knowledge that I *do* have, I have noticed that he tends to drop out of the conversation (rather than repeating the truths that I have made known). I've actually noticed /u/nullc dropping out of a conversation in a similar manner *when other users than myself* do the same thing. It seems like he is most interested in making sure the truth is well-known and available for those interested enough to research for it, and he doesn't often waste his time debunking things that were debunked before he got to them.

I've actually made an explicit mental note of this before (and very much respect him for this). I have been *proud* of some of the instances in which I responded with a quality rebuttal to someone he has been arguing with, and he stops responding to the thread. It indicates that he approves of my own contribution enough to feel comfortable leaving it at that. In other cases (and if I'm being totally honest, more often than not), he'll politely correct the things that I have gotten wrong or extend upon points that I didn't elaborate too deeply on.

>4n4n4 also referenced many of nullc's writings and posts. 4n4n4 referenced this code change that originated from nullc multiple times. 

Okay, sure, good point. There are two possible explanations for this... one is that 4n4n4 is indeed nullc. The other is that:

>Very knowledgable about Bitcoin Core development & the history of the scaling conflict.

**Exactly!**

This, alone, perfectly explains a lot (most? all?) of the similarities you have identified. 4n4n4 seems to have a deep knowledge of Bitcoin on a technical level, and clearly follows Core development closely. In fact, he seems to *like* Gregory Maxwell (assuming that he is not one and the same), which *also* explains why he might have picked up a few posting similarities (like the double-dash habit). This is a real phenomenon: I myself have picked up a few habits from Satoshi, in fact (I had to fight the urge to start using British spellings of certain words after I binged on Satoshi's writings for a few days).

>arguing that low fees and empty mempools are actually a problem.

They **are**, and this is well-known among those who understand Bitcoin on an academic level. Again, this is just another indication that 4n4n4 has a solid understanding of Bitcoin's tech and economics. I myself have made this argument, *many times*. I dare you to accuse me of being a sockpuppet account controlled by Gregory Maxwell; I would consider it an honor.

>Just like nullc, 4n4n4 liked BIP148 but did not ""support"" or ""endorse"" it.

1) The first link is to 4n4n4 *quoting nullc*, which (in my opinion) actually weakens your argument that they are the same person.

2) The first link actually also shows the fact that 4n4n4 is subscribed to the bitcoin-dev mailing list (in his second comment in the link, he mentions that he ""was too lazy to search it after just digging it up in my email""). This, again, seems to corroborate the hypothesis that he is a well-informed person who keeps up-to-date with Bitcoin technical developments, which (again) fairly well explains why he commonly agrees with Maxwell.

3) The second link **directly contradicts what you are claiming!** In it, 4n4n4 says: ""I'm personally running the BIP148 0.3 code right now"" which is *directly* supporting BIP148."
"> They have no idea that if you're the first person to register the name of the subreddit, you can do anything you want with it. 

Not true, even if you register a sub **first** reddit admins can take it from you."
And Dash marches on.
Is it crazy for me to suggest that we use a blockchain platform to secure online forums?  Isn't this what it's really all about?  Being able to discern the wheat from the chaff?
Those sick censors are not moderators. 
"That's not the sort of brigading reddit refers to.

Reddit is notoriously inconsistent with what sort of direct action campaigns it will allow, but those do not run afoul of what is typically referred to as brigading.

Odd sidenote: in that post, [you can see the guy who made the final cake day icon is celebrating his cake day today](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/5frg1n/tifu_by_editing_some_comments_and_creating_an/damughn/). Weird little coincidence.
reddit
T_D has a long history of brigading other subreddits, as well as internet polls and news articles. They break reddit rules constantly have have directly lead to at least two acts of violence. They are also super ban happy. T_D  bans users and deletes posts constantly.They might might be breaking reddit rules in the exact same way as the mods of bitcoin but the point is that spez treats those rules like guidelines. sometimes they dont apply when he feels like it.

Regarding /u/nullc, besides his comment being targetted by the bot, the ""sockpuppet"" of his could just be one of his many fans who imitate his writing style and talking points, and yes even sometimes have his back in comment threads.

Unless nullc mentioned it elsewhere. If I were a small blocker, I would immediately notice that pretty much every talking point originates with Gmax, he's the conduit of it all, so it would make sense to follow him around everywhere. 
What I don't understand is how they were able to hack so many /r/bitcoin accounts. I feel like it's strange that nobody is talking about the account hacking itself, how was that done? 
as much as i think he is out here to kill bitcoin and very likely behind this, do we have any proof this was him?
Ah, right, /u/cheeeeeese 's mom is very fat.
He's got a full time job scaling Bitcoin that is extremely important. Where does he find the time for this?
Ten year bro reporting in. Reddit is under pressure to make a profit, and they are choosing the worst most unscrupulous ways to do it.
(one of the admins wants ether to go up and wants to see bitcoin go down)
It's great that someone of your account age can come in here and state the obvious. What's been going on with these subreddits speaks volumes about reddit itself. Thank you.
"The sins of Blockstream and the cabal behind them should be archived on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain so that they're immutable and can forever be referenced. 

Reddit is part of this house of cards too. This is a place that is bought and paid for and there is no rule of law. "
Thank you. My once-over of the original thread did leave some open ends in my understanding. This filled in the blanks
I replied to a bunch of new redditors saying Segwit2x was an 'attack' on BTC. Seemed very fishy. Brand new accounts all saying the same thing.
Honest question: Why would writing in an alter-ego sockpuppet account lead to a prison sentence?
you left out the most important part
I can assure you, you're not the only one who has learned a few things about trusted sources from this incident. I just went from insignificant troll (who sometimes tries to clear up misunderstandings to the best of his ability) to conspiracy superstar in the blink of an eye.
"I got an email a few months ago, about bitcoin, that freaked me out. It used my Reddit name, which i don't use anywhere else. To my email which is connected to Reddit. I had thought at the time Reddit got hacked, but this makes more sense. No other unwanted spam of other content. I unsubbed from 'the sub which will remain unlinked' after realizing i was shadow banned already. No big block talk, whatsoever. If this gets any interest I'll try to dig it up. Can't quite remember but I think it was about some exchange.

/u/spez maybe mass censorship and manipulation isn't enough, it's their sub mod as you see fit, but giving my personal email out to third party has to be against the rules? Surely"
Oh I know what the hell is going on because nothing changes in this corrupt evil world. I don't need to read a wall of text to know that some shady shit is going down right now.
That's why /r/btc exists! But we cannot ignore the goings on in the original sub.
"Premature to say. Could just be a nullc fanboy. There are many.

The thing that is suspicious is the coincidence between this fan/sock and the comment targetted by the bot."
I think they have bigger problems to deal with than drama between two subreddits, unfortunately. Their motto usually is, if you don't like how a subreddit is being governed, make a new one.
We don't need any further proof at all, you're right. Just look at bitcoin.com, it's just 1 example of the techniques by BCash people trying to make money from the Bitcoin brand. It's unique within the crypto space for such blatant brand piggy-backing and in a normal market it would be sued out of existence.

Looks like 12 out of 45 links in the sidebar are to bitcoin.com pages (about 25%). I dont think most people here would argue that Ver doesnt promote his sites. The reason I have less of a problem with Ver's influence than Theymos's, is because Ver's web properties have dramatically less censorship, not because he promotes them less.
