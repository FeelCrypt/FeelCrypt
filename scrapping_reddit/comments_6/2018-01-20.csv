"That may be your problem. Not saying cexio is innocent or anything, but I've withdrawn using their other methods very recently without any problems. 

Banks on the other hand are still using horse and charriot methods which can get lost somewhere and you need a scouting pigeon to find out what's going on with your money."
There are countless threads just like this about coinbase. For every shady exchange there are 5 more trying to keep up with demand.
"Have you got any feedback from them? If not, I strongly advise to make an account on BtcTalk and ask for your money over there. 

There is this guy who was waiting for his money for a week and he got them today. It was not as much as you, but you never know.

Anyway, there's is no doubt that there is a serious problem going on with this exchange. There's a user over there who is waiting for 300,000 to be stored to his bank account for over 2 weeks also...

My guess is that they are not paying back big amounts and only little ones to keep their game going as long as they can. They keep telling anyone that ""they escalated the issue"" and that ""You will definitely receive your money. The processing just requires additional time to be processed, we will try to investigate with the Finance department on the status of the payment."""
Exactly. As much shit people like to give the US for crypto regulations and essentially being a tightass I’d trust exchanges located in and regulated by America (esp if I’m dealing in large amounts).  
Is it too late for a Christmas present for me?
Overcome my arrogancy? Is that a new one? I've never seen it before. If you actually think you made a single valid point there we're done here.
"Thanks for that scenario, yes that will probably happen or is already happening with the current credit card system? Who knows, maybe visa or hackers are selling out the information?

Actually i really like the idea of everyone paying a different price for the same good, because wealth is spread out really unfair, that would help the poor to be able to afford a product. 

Which the company could otherwise not sell to the poor person for that price, if the rich person wouldn't pay 5 times as much to compensate...

I am not saying the company is selling at a loss, but the company can sell very close to their production price to the poor people.

I really like that scenario, i really like transparency because it creates fairness and destroys all possibilities for lies."
Lol what do you do for a living? Not self employed, I hope.
"Do you actually realize that the price manipulation scenario you are talking about above is being practiced today by the national taxes and the free market anyways??

You can buy the same car cheaper in Portugal than you can buy the same car in Germany or UK.

So if everyone would get the same price, the poor people in Portugal would just not buy the car, because its too expensice...

So they raise the price for the Germans, to be able to lower the price for the other countries.

This is also happening with electricity and internet. It is extreme in the case of electricity.

Eletricity in Venezuela costs 4 cents, in Spain it is 14 cents and in Germany it is 25 cents...

It is the same electricity coming from the same nuclear plants in France (In the case of Spain and Germany).

Oh and while we are at it, did you realize that the miners in Canada only pay 2-3 cents per Kilowatt eletricity??? So yes! There is a difference in price for everyone and it has ever been that way and it must be that way.

I think you have been brainwashed by the Monero propaganda, they make so much marketing to make the people believe that privacy is actually sooo important.

That's why I'm 100% Ripple and BitConnect.
!RemindMe 1 year 'LN usage'
The problem is even in theory it still doesn’t provide zero fee transactions. You actually need to pay for two transactions. One to open the channel and one to close the channel. It works if you have some sort of recurring payment or micro transactions, but is completely useless for buying a pizza for instance. The other problem is your money is tied up for the duration of the lifetime of a payment channel. Lightning network is really no more than prepaying for something and then getting a refund for what you don’t spend. There are some niche scenarios where I think it’ll be a good thing, but for most payments I think it’s more overhead than what it’s worth. Definitely not the silver bullet that everyone seems to think it is. 
"> zero fee transactions

Free lunch doesn't exist. If median fee is 0, someone is still paying the costs. Low fees? Sure, but a lot of problems with routing and settling"
in reality you need to make atleast 2 transactions on chain to play with lightning
"This.

It does have some use cases. Its just not a silver bullet."
XRB, XLM, and others can do instant micropayments just fine right now
"Plausible, perhaps... But fact?....

I find it more likely that a for-profit company is pushing LN than the banking system pushing LN."
">It only needs to be accepted by banks and the elite who stand to profit from it. All they have to do is pump the price, and it wins.

That's why BS is pushing for the LN, to slowly turn BTC into Ripple, but I don't think the BTC holders even care if the LN could ever work, they just want the news it generates to pump up the price so they could sell after they made X10."
Does LN even hold a candle to xRapid's settlement times?
I joined reddit to talk about bitcoin.  That was in January of 2013.
"> But in the meantime they will be proposing a 3rd layer to create a lightning network of lightning networks, which might actually allow it to scale to a million million nodes tops, which could mean Lightning has won their gamble, if they can pull it off.

How can it scale on 3rd layer without a working 2nd layer? That's absurd.

>Meanwhile, BCH will be scaling on-chain and adding value in every way possible.

BCH has to be given the chance to show it scales first. Dash scales onchain and it's nowhere near the BTC market cap."
">Lightning has to absolutely fail before BCH can take over, meaning its own supporters must begin to admit to themselves that it has failed.

I don't think this is true, more and more businesses and users are adopting BCH, they are not waiting for LN. Bitpay is supposed to add BCH in a few weeks, that will be another good push.

I believe BTC's (and many altcoins) price rise is caused by Tether and Bitfinex, it's pure speculation, people are not investing in tech or future prospects. Tether has been printing USDT at an increasingly quick pace, now they are at 100M per day. I believe this is unsustainable, and the BTC price is going to crash very soon. Miners might then move to BCH because its DAA will give them better profits. This may trigger a chain death spiral in BTC, as more hash power moves over to BCH, BTC becomes slower and its capacity drops, BTC price drops as people try to leave, hash power leaves..."
"Just add payment channels as an option to BCH and it will have both, then the user can decide what method they want to use.  
  
But bitcoin has already said LN is not necessary, so I really don't understand what is happening in that sub right now. Why would they need instantaneous cheap transactions when they themselves have been chanting that bitcoin is a store of value not meant to be spent?"
I'm not sure their supporters will ever realize in significant numbers...they don't seem to be paying attention.
"> But in the meantime they will be proposing a 3rd layer to create a lightning network of lightning networks, which might actually allow it to scale to a million million nodes tops, which could mean Lightning has won their gamble, if they can pull it off.

This is just a meme, right? "
Who said anything about holding? Read again.
"This is an interesting point to ponder.

It has drastically higher awareness, yet a minority of the total market cap.

Like MySpace? Relax, I'm just kidding. Or not.
I suspect all miners would want to follow that fork, seeing as how they would mine more coins rather than just collecting fees.

That’s the whole argument from you Bcash trolls. Bitcoin is broken because the fees are too high (you can’t buy coffee with it). If that’s not your idiot logic, tell me, why isn’t Bitcoin “legit”?
"If you look at the value of transactions over BTC, you can see that over half are over $2,000USD in value. Only a small amount (10% or so) are for less than $50.

Since LN has liquidity restrictions due to channel funding limits, it is reasonable to presume that it will primarily only be used for small transactions.

This means that perhaps 10% of on-chain transactions will naturally migrate to LN. This isn't irrelevant, but I'm not convinced it will actually cause any appreciable reduction in on-chain volume.

If in fact LN does become useful for small transactions, you may actually expect on-chain transactions to increase as a greater number of people may adopt BTC.

For these reasons, I expect high fees to continue to be a problem. However, the security model of LN relies on the ability to settle transactions to the blockchain in a reliable manner. If you can't reliably confirn an anti-cheat transaction, the security model is suspect."
with the current inflation they are issuing i would say its unlikely that your second point will be viable for much longer

I understand tether but why tron?
Looks like ETH gets closer to there.
I think you're inferring that point.  
"Things were pretty different ""a couple years ago"" "
"What makes you think they don't think other crypto is useful? Why the ""only?"""
This is the most obvious and entertaining response from noobs.  You say something about bitcoin and they assume you ONLY hold bitcoin (EDIT: aka only own bitcoin, bitcoin maximalist etc).  Lol...happens all the time on this sub when trying to have convos. No understanding of why bitcoin is a thing.
Probably the most telling is that bitcoin has almost 100% of the market awareness if they know about crypto currency at all amongst the general population. 
"> If you add enough decimal places, you can make a crypto currency with only 1 ""coin"".

The ""Onecoin"" guys should have made a currency like this instead of a scam."
Isn't there a onecoin from like 2013? Or has that died now?
This. I was waiting for such a response. And don't forget CHAO as well, with a total supply of only 23 coins! If you like novelty cryptocurrencies, then those are must-haves.
"Scarcity and divisibility aren't the same, bro. Scarcity means finite/predictible supply. Divisibility means ability to split into and reemerge smallest representations of value

Absolute numbers of coins doesn't matter"
That would cause a hard fork, and only those who chose to follow that fork would be affected. I suspect not many people would want to follow that fork.
"Everyone abandons it, no one uses wallets or runs nodes or has a back up of the blockchain, you know ""failed"""
[deleted]
Good thing I wasn't persuade by others who advised to invest in bitconnect :). I'm glad that I did my own research :)
I know right?
XMR is super interesting and I'm just now learning about it, so please correct me if I'm wrong here. My understanding is that you need the entire blockchain forever because spent transactions will forever appear unspent as part of its security feature. Any transaction can be referenced in any future transaction as being a possible source for the coins even if it is not, so it must remain on the chain. It's a genius system, but they may have se scaling challenges ahead of them.
it doesnt really scale that well though. even fluffypony says that.
"> Bitcoin isn’t “legit” because you can’t buy a coffee with it

Where did I say that?"
It's the most profitable coin and it's more scarce than Bitcoin.

"Lightning has to absolutely fail before BCH can take over, meaning its own supporters must begin to admit to themselves that it has failed.

That might not happen for a good while. They are now rolling out Lightning to mainnet and posting about payments. This is likely responsible for current BTC significant price-rise.

They will be able to cast this as a success until Lightning fails to scale, if it fails to scale.

That is expected to happen somewhere between 10,000 nodes and 1 million nodes.

That will take a long time to get to that point. Only once Lightning fails to scale and the congestion problem becomes chronic, do people start to wonder if it's actually a failure.

But in the meantime they will be proposing a 3rd layer to create a lightning network of lightning networks, which might actually allow it to scale to a million million nodes tops, which could mean Lightning has won their gamble, if they can pull it off.

Meanwhile, BCH will be scaling on-chain and adding value in every way possible.

So, what we're facing is a scaling race. 

Betting it all on Lightning is much riskier proposition than what BCH is attempting, and I am a BCH partisan for that and many other reasons, but the game is not decided yet, and who can say how it will ultimately shake out.

There is a lot that can go wrong in Lightning even apart from failing to scale, and they may face significant hiccups.

But the point is, there needs to be a schelling point to create an actual flippening. And it would likely need to correlate to some very public failure of Lightning coupled to a very public success of BCH."

From a business perspective, it makes sense to accept as many forms as payment as possible, providing the overhead of each doesn't exceed the marginal profit from each.

Less people own coins, less secure chains
Too much stupid in this thread it's embarrassing.
"I'm not saying there is a solution, I'm just outlining the logical case in which adding another layer allows for a capability that layer 2 was originally intended to provide.

However, for completeness:

Sure.
https://i.imgur.com/NYu6CEh.png
Certainly, prices for many crypto are still fairly tightly tethered to BTC. If it failed very soon, do you think it would at least be a forest-fire across the board (forests often grow back stronger after)?
the level of security of chains is much more about the number of full nodes or diversity of mining pool than number of people owning said coin.
Sure. Andreas made a great comparison: USD is Titanic and BTC is a zodiac on waves. Well, BTC is new Titanic (since decline of portability) and several open blockchains around it are new zodiacs on ever harsher waves. Let the fittiest win!
I meant less distributed **and** less secure. Number of non-mining nodes is irrelevant due to Sybil attack, but mining = security. How many exahashes/s secure coins u named?

The only thing lightning has going for it is a neat-sounding name, and a public that doesn't know enough about it to know how much it will suck. 
Yes, that is why it is important for BCH to take off before that in terms of adoption. There is no time to waste.
Add some DBC and you're all set.
Lmao not true at all
This is actually true
They said diversify so I have, Ethereum, Neo, EOS, Omisego, IOTA, RIPPLE, streamr Data, Golem and Aventus. Is it wrong? :(
"Depends how Lightning pans out, BTC partisans can still plausibly claim Lightning will solve their congestion woes.

If that fails to materials within say a year, we'll be looking for a Schelling point to get out. You will want to be out before that."
Yeah cuz you register at multiple exchanges and get random airdops every other day, also giveaways and freebies...
"Not really sure why this is being upvoted, this is basic math.

If you only know about Bitcoin and you buy 0.01 BTC, 100% of your portfolio consists of BTC. If you then learn about another cryptocurrency and buy any amount of that currency, your portfolio is now no longer 100% BTC."

100% bitconneeeeeeecttt!!! 
He's probably only at phase 2 of bitcoin understanding.
"This has absolutely been my experience. 

Started out with 100% BTC, then branched out into ETH and LTC on Coinbase. Then I added a significant amount of BCH when they added that.  Now I’m starting my full blown shitcoin phase. "
Exactly! That’s what I have. Close to zero BTC. 
Very true!  Even my mum has jumped ship and she adored bitcoin.  They have alienated so many people.
Bitcoin is the most scarce coin out there at 21 million capped supply. Good luck to anyone that passes on the opportunity. When cryptocurrency becomes mainstream there will be so much fomo for Bitcoin you can’t even imagine 
Yeah right. If the bitcoin blockchain project fails, everything will be right behind it. 
Only in r/BTC can you read shit like this and get downvoted for having a opinion. 
No truer words have been spoken
Stay away from anything that has bit in it.
Nan Ruiner is a hype machine.
Bitbean HODL
Same goes for BCH
very true
With that statement he has lots to learn.

There's a wave of new promising crypto you can buy for like 100 coins for $1 then a month later you realize it went 100x I mean it's free money all outside the main coins I've made $15,000 from $500 thru jetcoin, sugarexchange and some others
The only BTC I hold in my account is what is currently being paid out from Nicehash. Other than that, I have zero BTC in my entire portfolio. I actually don't hold BCH, either, but I transfer some from my exchanges to temporary wallets if I want to use it as a currency. As a general rule, though, I don't hold Bitcoin as an investment at all because I think the flippening happens and other more efficient coins become more mainstream. Like raiblocks.
Lol who is this fag...what a noob
https://i.imgur.com/SRBdEPj.jpg
Actually, guys at www.blockchainwhispers.com/tm are now actually suggesting to move from bitcoin completely until it settles
Another year?! They have been promising LN for too long. I think the BCH flippening will happen in a few months, much less than a year.
"> 
> 
> If that fails to materials within say a year

They themselves recognise that at best we're looking at 18 months, so..."
Touché
People downvote over disagreeing everywhere. Crowd wisdom is emergent characteristic of such forums. r/btc is no exception
"Depends on what you mean by ""fail"". If it sees a slow bleed over years until it's no longer relevant, the ecosystem could be untouched."
"I don't believe that for a second.

E: I was referring specifically to BTC."
Some folks with literally trillions of dollars are pushing LN: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k14EDcB-DcE

However, there are some to avoid, like bitconnect ;)"

I almost agree with you... none of the top 10 coins are legit. They’re all old tech or copies.
"Let's not shit all over lightning. It sounds like a very interesting idea and if it works it would be beneficial.  However it seems like the major advantages to it are micro payments, which not many (none?) crypto can do right now. Some other crypto could adopt lightning in the future and gain micro payments, but BTC is trying to use it to solve all payments, which seems weird. Regular payments make sense on-chain, thousands of micro payments could use a system like LN to aggregate it all into a regular on-chain payment.  
  
tldr; LN could be cool but seems like it's most useful for micro payments."
Bitcoin can't fail. Unresolved chain split will end, though. Bitcoin Cash will win
So Bitcoin isn’t “legit” because you can’t buy a coffee with it? Sure thing buddy.

You make it sound much different than the reality of the situation.  Only on /r/btc the anti bitcoin sub reddit lol. It's already beginning to be used and will continue throughout the year.

"> Why will lightning even work and be accepted by the market?

In theory it provides zero fee transactions, but in practice it's doubtful it'll work even remotely as promised in the next few years because of how hard the problem it is trying to solve."
The supply cap is software. Don't assume that in the years to come the developers (whoever they are) won't suddenly decide to attempt to increase that. Greed is a powerful thing.
With a cartoon head and Mexican accent, and subpar grammar
Meh, Ran has been at it a while. He likes saying stuff like this to get attention. Not long ago he tweeted he was selling everything and opting to only hold BTC. He was lying through his teeth but he said it anyway because he knew he'd get a rise out of his followers. 
I am sorry but if you think bitcoin is the only useful crypto I doubt your knowledge no matter how long you spent.
Nope. Go look up 42 coin 
"My portfolio was 100% BTC until a couple years ago, and I would consider myself very savvy.

Just because you learn about a bunch of other currencies doesn't mean you will invest in them if you are smart. What you will do if you are smart in this market though is not be 100% BTC."
It's true I agree all these noobs here it's embarrassing what this sub has become.
name checks out
I think you missed the point. The more you learn about crypto, the more you realize how flawed bitcoin is, and hence invest accordingly.
Few months in this feels like years!.. But yup..totally agree with OP, I hold no bitcoin..
Scarcity is important, but so is portability
"The problem with your statement is that it infers (but I might be wrong, there was not enough meat in your one liner) that the price progression of Bitcoin will be dictated by it's price progression in the past. I prefer to believe that the price of a crypto-project is influenced by multiple more fundamental factors like the ""health"" of it's community, how it implement changes and adapt, how it attract new contributors, how it integrate and play nice with other existing projects, how it it attract investors etc."

"NEO is 21 million times more scarce than BTC as it isn’t divisible. 

1 NEO = 1 NEO
1 BTC = 100,000,000 satoshis 

NEO is a sleeping giant. "
Surprisingly accurate depiction of the enthusiast retail investor. Not a bad thing, per se.
"LN will be a success.

There are huge forces with endless pockets pushing for it. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k14EDcB-DcE"
My own shit is scarce too, I only drop a deuce twice a day.
"Scarcity isn't really comparable in absolute terms. 21 million isn't even the true number, as the base unit is a Satoshi. There are 100 million x 21 million satoshis.

If you add enough decimal places, you can make a crypto currency with only 1 ""coin""."
Thank you, Winston.  Bitcoin FIBRE looks like a great way for mining pools to communicate internally, and for performance-critical full nodes like exchanges to get/send blocks with minimal latency.  Thanks for the interesting pointer.

"That assumes:  
1. You know the difference between opting in and opting out  
2. Your wallet software supports opting out  
3. Your coffee shop's POS software recognizes the difference between RBF and non-RBF transactions  
4. Your coffee shop's payment processor has decided to accept 0-conf non-RBF transactions

That's a much harder social coordination problem than BCH's status quo:  
1. Your coffee shop's payment processor has decided to accept 0-conf transactions"
"Well I'm a knowledgable person in the field and I can tell you he is extremely intellectually dishonest and very short-sighted.  He doesn't understand good software and lacks the vision to see the big picture. 
 He's too concerned with defending his own little territory he's carved up.  He doesn't like new ideas unless they come from him.  He regularly shoots down the ideas of developers much smarter than him, because he didn't think of it first.  And because he sees power first and control before any other criterion.  If he anoints someone with a ""yes"" for his idea or proposal -- he first needs to make sure that person is very loyal and controllable.

He is shit at actually producing good software.  And it shows. Bitcoin has stagnated massively under his ""leadership"" as a piece of software.  

"
Their current CEO Adam Back very publicly shilled for the BTG scamcoin which turned out to steal BTC private keys. Some people lost their BTC and BTG because of it.
"I think he is likely one of the main reasons why BTC is stuck with 1MB..

I am rather anxious he has been fired from Blockstream..

"
The people working *for* blockstream may have different intentions than the people who invested in and *own* blockstream.  Hiring well-meaning but ineffective patsies while making it so toxic the really smart people leave or stay away accomplishes the intended goal.  Except, the really smart people went somewhere else and started their own projects.
Ant, what is your current opinion of Greg?
"Interesting. Resigned in November, but still on the team sheet in January...

Yep, this is most definitely the case.

Remember something else which happened around November. [Blockstream CEO Adam Back first popularized the BTG forkcoin and pumped it](https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/922569768770478080) so that people would use its [official BTC-stealing scam wallets when trying to sell it or whatever](https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/935928919391440896). Two of those BTG wallet scams were uncovered in November.

Ha ha exactly!
"Don't hold your breath. My understanding is that the original code is pretty obtuse. However, it has shown to be secure over the past 10 years - so far only about 5 show-stopper bugs, and 2 or 3 hard forks. Not bad for a continuously-available peer-to-peer network...

Let's just be glad that RBF and Segwit got yanked in BCH. Most of the important refactoring will likely occur on that tree. The new features on BCH are nice - most notably the new address formats and the difficulty adjustment fixes. "
"> You are not happy that he may have been pushed out? Is this not step 1 of ""operation dragon slayer"" :)

I don’t give a shit, I would actually prefer he keep screwing up BTC."
No, I think they probably really thought side chains were the solution (and maybe they are) but they couldn't really implement that except in their limited federated way.
Some of those bugs have been in code that quite literally shouldn't have been in a reference implementation though. Don't worry about arguing about it though, I'm starting to work through what I think needs to be done.

Do you run into any issues holding client crypto funds in a trust account for them? I’ve heard some state Bars require you to exchange to USD immediately and then hold it in trust. 
BTG is scam, with scammy devs who stole coins and pre-mine
"a chain fork is a voluntary mutual dissociation between network *peers*, between *equal peers*

Or I need to create some automatic gateway before this? I think there are no reason do to this automatically, because nobody interested :(

"Well crypto is its own property. If they intend for a trustee to hold property in trust for the benefit of a beneficiary, there is no need to convert.

The problem arises when funds are held in a trust account to pay the attorney for services rendered. This is where it can get sticky, where some bars (I am sure) require crypto to be exchanged at that time to be held in a client trust account (to then pay the attorney for fees and expenses related to their representation)

Edit - I have not run into this problem specifically but I am governed by Florida Rules which generally allow it. See http://www4.floridabar.org/divexe/rrtfb.nsf/FV/6D5B076E51CCBC9985257172004C0105"

Check out this [announcement](https://medium.com/@freetrade68/announcing-bcash-8b938329eaeb) for what Bcash is. 
Thank you sir
Do you have a list of places that accept BCH? I want to get into one of the widely accepted payments coins, don’t know much about BCH yet
Tip on defaults and explain to people what bch is and how it's faster and cheaper than Bitcoin. Show them it's a top 5 coin after forking just a few months ago because it's what the people wanted!
Good stuff
