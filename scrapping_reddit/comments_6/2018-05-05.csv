Having a phone does not mean having a smartphone, let alone a decent/working internet service, let alone knowledge about cryptocurrencies, let alone having wallets/services for those in your language, let alone people you can use it with.
It is, because if you'd like to send someone money from outside the country, BCH has fees less than a cent, compared to a bank's transfer fee.
Oh wow. So much easier than, you know, just using fiat.
"That's why [CoinText](https://cointext.io) exists.

You can use a phone with only texting capabilities, only needing cellular service (otherwise, why would you have a phone), with easy conversion rates when sending in the local currency to BCH, with the only knowledge needed being how to send and receive with your address, with easy compatibility with every phone number listed on the page."
There are more people that have phones than toilets.
