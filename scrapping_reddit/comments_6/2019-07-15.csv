Literally just saw this posted today...
Don’t forget Tulsi. She’s got more balls than the rest of them put together. Only candidate to stick up for Assange by name.
A vote is a vote. Nothing is wasted. Change has always come from fringe political parties. Slavery abolition, for example.
"Sham*e*   
Try this"
"Yeah, when it was happening I almost thought ""Maybe this will spur people on to start considering political implications more"", but that's backfired. Or it looks that way.

If Yang or Sanders don't win the next election it'll be more of the same. Even if they *do* win it'll still be very slightly less of the same."
"Glad you've cottoned onto that anyway - it's demoralising once you realise it, but the earlier the better. I'd been talking to my parents about dirty politics for years and they couldn't understand why I was so distrustful, figured it was youthful naiveté - until 2008 happened and their pensions got a 60% haircut, taxes got hiked and their property value halved.

They still preferred voting for ""safe"" options.

>Ooh, that's a wasted vote though.

Not if enough people stop wasting their votes on scumbags."
"It is an incredible sham~~e~~

Edit: goddamn, strikethroughs through lower-case e does nothing"
The whole country wants deep drastic change. Thats part of how obama got elected. Burn it all down was much more appealing than conservative democract. I think all the damage trumps done is good actually. It will either make the politicians show their true colors. Or have to actually fuckin buck up and do their jobs for once.
It wasn't clear to me at the time that they can not say anything that is true, lying is their job and if they don't lie they don't do their job and they will be fired!
The issue with elections is that in most cases you can choose between shit and crap.
"What you're describing isn't a function of the central bank.  It's a function of social policy.   

If you look at history, what keeps private interests from accumulating all the wealth is *central/government regulation*.   The notion that an unregulated market will even things out is not reflected at all in the sum total of all human history."
It's been clear for the past 30-40 years that he was one of the leeches in the swamp - how did you fall for the rhetoric?
It is hidden, lol
Yeah i really like both of them, warren too. Hecause at the end of the day. Nothing will change until we fix the corporate and financial corruption that is running this country. Nothing else matters hesides that and climate change. Because fixing those things, making life better for the average person will ripple out through society, dampening the shootings, racism and other issues that are boiling up right now under all this pressure.
People are feeling it alright. It's just that it's a gradual change of wealth streaming slowly but steadily from normal people to the banks and the 1% who can take advantage of central banking and rampant inflation. When my parents were young, one man could buy a house and a car and provide for a family without taking a loan. Can you imagine that today? If it wasnt for the enormous technical achievements in production we would be even worse of in comparison.
Yes however as we have seen this before in politics.  Trump is for something D.C. is against or Trump against and D.C. is for.
This meme was completely designed for this.
orange man bad - the fed irrational as ever. What a miserable coin they have
"> “It is no coincidence that the century of total war coincided with the century of central banking.”  - Ron Paul

The Fed is one of the greatest scams in human history. I'm actually surprised by the igorance of Trump in this regard, he's been saying a long time the system is rigged against the middle class and this is the number one reason in my belief. But as many have pointed out, the tweet doesn't even seem to have been written by himself. Slightly concerning, but also a great boost to the Bitcoin brand recognition."
You think Trump may have been quietly signalling to the fed with that statement?
Ha good one. Thin air would be the trillion dollar printing press the Feds have. Anybody care to count 1 to a Trillion? Yes that will be 32 years.

"Yeah, we can not put the whole weight on one man. To be honest, I liked his ""drain the swamp"" speech, and I was a little entused, but you know they always disappoint, I should have known. The problem is giving them authority, it is not really needed."

Edit: phrasing"
"The ""orange man"" didn't write that tweet himself, nor does he even understand what he (or one of his flunkies) posted.

This is a guy that, in 2019, has never used email or even an actual computer for heaven's sake -- yet thinks his opinion on cryptocurrency carries any weight.

Honestly, Trump's whole angry-dementia-patient-yells-at-cloud Twitter shtick is getting really old."
"> The Fed is one of the greatest scams in human history.

If this is a scam, how come it seems to basically work?   Can you point to how it's ruining the economy?   I recognize you think the organization is horrible, but if it's so horrible how come everyday people aren't feeling it?"
"We have a limited supply of memes and inflation control.

The miners of memes will be happy."
I'm in Europe so I haven't heard of all of them - glad to hear there are more fighting the good fight!
