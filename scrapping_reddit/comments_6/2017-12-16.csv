I mistakenly read as /u/segwitCop that would be funny
That's why I listed those two last, but it is true. Google+ was amazing, but when you already hold the majority no one will want to switch. LTC will have a lot to offer when they move to Casper. But if Lightning Network drops before that, LTC will have nothing to offer before Bitcoin. ETH however will see value increase as we continue to see. Everyone told me it wouldn't break $400, and I'm now sitting happily in my money back as well as the same amount of Etherium. They have some scalability issues to solve as well, but it's better than BTC as the two stand today. XMR will continue to see growth as it is truly the anonymous crypto. I also believe LTC and BCH will continue to see growth despite lack of innovation compared to Bitcoin, as there's already a lot of money in both markets and crypto diversity will keep them alive. 
"The current leading libertarian candidate Austin Peterson calls for a 1% across the board cut in taxes; not a complete abolishment of the tax structure.

You're conflating one or two types of Libertarianism (Anarcho-capitalism/communism or Geo-libertarianism) to the entire Libertarian party.

In fact there are 11 different types of libertarians and only a portion of those would be against ownership taxes.  Minarchists and Classical liberals would strongly support ownership taxes but would want them very small and used for a small number of services.

Try again. I'd love to see evidence of a Libertarian platform that agrees with ownership taxes just for the sake of your argument.
That's why I'm watching ByteBall -- quite possibly the best platform/ecosystem for real commerce that I've seen. And they also offer anonymous transactions. It's really a fascinating time to watch crypto (not to say it hasn't been interesting enough since all the way back in 2010)
Maybe. I don't think BCH or LTC have much to offer in the long rune. They are better, but not 10x better, which they have to be to get people to switch. For example, you can make a better Facebook, it doesn't mean people will use it.
Yeah XMR and ETH have something drastically different to offer. They are playing a different sport, you could say. Bitcoin will never be anonymous or a platform.

I think so too.  I bet they add ripple, bch and dash.
segwit btc is the digital equivalent of casually throwing $20 bills out the window every time you do a transaction. right there alongside lighting your cigar with a banknote and throwing away your socks after wearing them one time.

Well, Coinbase is to buy and sell cryptos, if people HODL them is not the decision of Coinbase. Also, Coinbase has the same service as BitPay, it is just not used as often as BitPay: https://www.coinbase.com/merchants

"No, Bitcoin Segwit is the hijacked version of Bitcoin that has been stagnated for years by Blockstream (The centralized Core development team controlling the development of BTC). It has a sloppy hack called Segwit that had no consensus despite Core lying to everyone to say it had majority support.

Bitcoin Cash is the coin that has consensus of users, merchants and miners, and is usable as a CryptoCurrency, with signatures still intact in the blockchain as per the original definition of Bitcoin.

To suggest that Segwitcoin is Bitcoin is fraudulent and misleading. This altcoin needs to move aside and let the real Bitcoin take its place. To avoid confusion, it should re-brand itself to SegwitCoin, or BGold if it wants to be a store of value."

"
You realize such a person wouldn't need to rewrite from the moment of the fork right? They could actually start building such a chain now and reorg the next x weeks... From what I see btcs hashrate keeps getting bigger and bchs has actually been getting lower, the more that trend continues the easier and cheaper it will be for an attacker to pull this off, and they can start at any time. Blockstream has money to blow, maybe they'll do it. It doesn't really matter who, but there are people that have money and a large incentive to destroy bch so I wouldn't get too comfortable storing value with bch knowing this threat exists. Even a 1 week reorg starting from today would be enough to crush bch.

"If thats true then it's a real shame. If BCH wants to assert that it's ""the real bitcoin"" then it needs to support the claim that BTC is the fake bitcoin. Its hard to do that when you're adopting their standards verbatim. It plays into the narrative that the BTC developers are the ""real developers"", and the BCH devs are ""fake developers"" that copy BTC.

Whats next, also adopting every other useless extension they come up with? You guys were on the right track by not adopting segwit, but then you go and ruin it by adopting bech32? It doesn't make sense.

You could have at least changed it to bech31 or something, or change it in some other superficial way. There are literally infinite ways to create distinct addresses from BTC, why in the hell did you guys have to use the exact same format the core developers made up? It make it look like BCH is ran by people who can't do anything other than copy code from the core developers.

"Coinbase is important, but they already support multiple cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin Cash is an obvious addition, and only a matter of time.

Bitpay's CEO notably [stated](https://hypepotamus.com/people/bitpay-stephen-pair/):

> BitPay’s business model only needs one cryptocurrency. 

The fact that he now chooses Bitcoin Cash as secondary currency, is much more important.

From the same interview:

> If we were to add a second cryptocurrency, it would because we thought that alternative had a chance at overtaking bitcoin. "
Also because, if Coinbase fully supports BCH (buys/trades/merchants), we can finally start paying for things in crypto again (e.g. Purse.io and Gyft become viable again). I used to buy things with btc and buy back the btc I spent in coinbase, and would break even or even save $ (with Gyft's 3% back or Purse's 5%+). Bitpay is great, but we need a quick/easy fiat unramp to get back to where we were 2 years ago.
Does this mean they acknowledge Segwit is now an altcoin?

Good bot.
How's BCH in any way immutable? 
It’s back under a new and improved title. 
Cause Bitcoin is the name of another coin?
"No because Bitcoin is Bitcoin. Core is the development team. U new here?

https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7k2cu8/bitpay_will_process_payments_on_multiple/drba3dm
You have no idea if somebody has been building a longer chain in secret... That's the difference between bch and btc. On btc it's near impossible, on bch it's a very real possibility and your hand waving about game theory isn't gonna change that.
A BitPay developer has said that they will switch to Bech32 when others are switching to Bech32. User experiance is the key. Everyone will gain from using the same format.
"It's a possibility.

In the end we all win."
"Not for the reasons you think, 

BU voted to support both, the market will decide private keys not affected so it's not a big issue. its a UX, UI issue. "
I know, but I also know when I use Bitpay, there will be a point in time, when the merchant will have 10%+ of orders with crypto. At this point I am sure some of them will convert to keeping the coins or portion of the coins

Well, everyone in the world is just like you, so I guess you're right
"To be a currency, yes. It was and still is with Bitcoin Cash.  Current Bitcoin Segwit is headed a different direction.

Bitcoin Cash has higher capacity of 8MB, and actually its 32MB, with a simple miner config change.  Then its obvious we will just hard fork and go beyond that.  They have already put out tests with 1GB blocks.  Bitcoin Cash is made to scale worldwide. "
How about you exchange the BTC for litecoin and then buy the item? 
Bitcoin used to be very low fees and quick transactions until it started to gain some ground. Bcash will do the same thing if it ever gains the same ground that bitcoin has. I don’t know why people want to act high and mighty when it comes to other cryptos as a whole, we are all here for the same thing. Decentralization.
"> 2nd layer solutions do not remove security from the blockchain when done right.

2nd layer solutions are not on the blockchain, and therefore are less secure."
No, it didn't take any longer than buying with my CC. I dont remember what I paid for the TX fee but it was probably like $5-10.
I don't see why they wouldn't if enough people request it. They already have bitcoin in place so switching it to BCH wouldn't be that difficult.
"I would really recommend the Electron-Cash wallet. Then again, I was always a fan of Electrum, which is derived from.

Both. It’s complicated. This sub is for discussing BTC and BCH uncensored. The other sub is BTC only and heavily censored.
"They can't roll back until genesis block unless they are able to recreate more proof of work than the one  done through this 8 years in very little time, which is not possible. Realistically unless they have more than 90% of hashing power they can only rewrite a few blocks back before they need to mine secretly for weeks to be successful.

Moreover both attacks do not have similar risks. The attack against SPV nodes in which they can mine invalid blocks allows them more than just double spends. They can rewrite the consensus rules and, for, example, create coins out of thin air. "
"> The attack against SPV nodes in which they can mine invalid blocks allows them more than just double spends. They can rewrite the consensus rules and, for, example, create coins out of thin air.

They can create invalid blocks and trick SPV clients into accepting them. Whether the block pays the SPV wallet with stolen coins, already-spent coins, never-existed coins is immaterial. In all these cases the danger is that the person running an SPV wallet will accept the coins, then later discover they aren't valid and have been defrauded of funds. This is the exact same risk as accepting payment in a valid block that later gets orphaned.

In fact orphaning a chain is a better attack for a coaltion of majority-but-not-totality of hashpower. If they mine invalid blocks, they're out the block reward for each block (which cuts into their attack profits). If they orphan the chain mined by the honest miners they don't incurr this loss (instead they get the side-benefit of harming the honest miners)."
"> They can't roll back until genesis block unless they are able to recreate more proof of work than the one done through this 8 years **in very little time**, which is not possible.

The highlighted text is absolutely not a requirement."
It's kinda amusing in a grim way. That explanation made some sense at the time people started saying it. But then storage space costs fell ridiculously quickly and dropped the floor out from under the argument. The argument if you'll think about it with a fresh mind is that hardly anyone will be able to run a full node because it will take up too many gigabytes to store the chain. Not too many terabytes. Gigabytes.
Wait, are the two subs different currency or just same coin and arguing over tech?
looks like a shit sandwich to me!
"I mean I think people are starting to do some of that, that's why the price of litecoin and bch skyrocketed these days.

But critics of the status quo are more likely to just slowly abandon bitcoin all together if fees remain high. Why would they use bitcoin for purchasing a car when they can use bitcoin cash faster and for a lower fee? They don't see BCH as less secure.

Moreover not many people are buying cars with crypto these days. They used to use bitcoin to make donations, buy games from steam, purchase small things online, etc. They can't do this anymore. "

"Bitcoin Cash as it is right now could have more than 7 times the popularity of bitcoin Core and still have a clear mempool; and if it gets to a point 8mb starts getting close to not being enough, the limit will be raised again."
What does it mean?
Does difficulty affect this?

If they mine invalid blocks they hard fork the blockchain and all SPV clients follow this new blockchain. They don't lose on block reward, on the contrary, they can give themselves a block reward of trillions of bitcoins or whatever they want. 
Ok I can selectively pick posts as well in a small snapshot at time.  But it doesn’t take a genius to realize r/btc has way more shit post about bitcoin than r/bitcoin does about Roger and bcash.
"That's a good point and if they manage to reduce block transmission i/o by reusing the already downloaded transactions that would be great... But having a higher blocksize and therefor lower fees has the systemic consequence of people being less efficient with which transactions they make. If fees are low enough it encourages people to make micro transactions and dust transactions on-chain.

In other words, high block size increases the total amount of transactions submitted by people cause people are able and willing to make more inefficient transactions. "
They would take more than 8 years on paying tons of electricity with no reward before being able to perform such an attack. Its not possible to reverse blocks from days ago without spending an unsustainable amount of money for more than a week with no reward *during that time before the attack* unless you have way more than just a slight majority hashrate. 
"I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

Prepare for disappointment, the main devs on BCH are actually working on BTC and their code is just copied over. It is probably going to be hard to find a dev to come over here considering how horrible of a reputation R. Ver has.
"I don't know why an AMA is required, the guy repeats the same talking points in every forum. ""I was the first person in the world to invest in Bitcoin"" ""I poured my heart and soul into Bitcoin"" ""Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin"" while sticking to propaganda techniques of never referring to Bitcoin as Bitcoin but calling it ""Bitcoin Core"". Doing his best to mislead people into assuming Bitcoin Cash is in any way as sound of a platform as Bitcoin.... the guy's a broken record."
"Look at the date /r/BTC was created. This sub was created a long time ago to give people free speech away from the censorship of /r/bitcoin. A place where people who could see the problems with small blocks could talk about fixing the issues without being censored. You know like the problems with high fees and slow transactions.
If you want to talk about low tactics how the fuck do you justify calling BCH bcash when you know that is not its name ? And to say you doing this to avoid confusion ? And then setting up a sub called /r/bcash ??  Trolling the fuck out of /r/ BTC with some cart misleading posts and outright lies ??

Seriously , go fuck yourself. You may want to re-evaluate the community you are part of.

"
"You should write to all the traditional money exchanges, how have they coped all these years. Just think of all those people who bought Australian dollars thinking they was buying USD or Jamaican or Canadian or New Zealand dollars.

If this is difficult for you to understand then yes you keep calling it bcash so you don't get confused. Good luck getting tying your shoelaces tomorrow."
"But how can they not be confused and be buying the wrong type of dollar ? Surely if we use your logic and your argument then people would be turning up at airports all around the world expecting to have a nice holiday, horrified to discover they bought the wrong dollars.

Or is it actually that no-one is getting confused and it's just lies and propoganda from core supporters ?

Can you cope with this logic or do you need to rest up? I'm keeping it as simple as possible . "
"No , the fact that people do not get confused by at least 10 other currencies called ""dollar"" proves you are talking shit to fit your agenda. You are the one theorising that people will be confused. 
If your theory was true that people buying currency would be confused by having a generic name such as ""bitcoin"" or ""dollar"" then lots of people would be buying the wrong kind of dollars but you admit that doesn't happen.

The only people causing problems and confusion are the people trying to brigade exchanges and websites to use a false name for a coin they see as a threat to the coin they are invested in. 
"
I only say evolved because it started out being referred to by the majority as Bitcoin Cash, now the majority call it Bcash. The reason that this is less confusing is because the name Bcash does not have the word Bitcoin in it. If my comment is difficult for you to understand try reading it again slowly, I assure you that this makes sense and I have confidence that you put a little work into it you will be able to understand!
"Obviously there is a massive difference between various dollars which would be very difficult to accidentally buy the wrong one of and two very new, very similar cryptocurrencies that are often sold along side each other to people who are just learning about them.

There, I just blew all your BS to hell. That right there, the fact that you are trying to act like it is somehow common sense that if ppl confuse BTC and BCH that they would also confuse fiat currencies is absurd. The fact that you so desperately cling to that as your only lifeboat is very strong evidence that you have nothing. You are just trying to shove anything out there to try and hide the fact that we just walked to the end of your train of thought only to find that there is nothing there after all. I appreciate your attempt, I would have loved to have found something there to change my mind, maybe next time. Thanks for trying, please don't stop :)"
"Would it bother you if someone started a currency called Cash Bitcoin and they set up a community for it over at r/BCH despite it actually being CHB? How about if they then took it a step further and started calling your coin 'Bitcoin Cash Core' and calling their coin 'Bitcoin Cash'?

If this seems like low tactics, then yoy may want to reevaluate the community that you are a part of. "
"You say obviously but give no details, has your argument been proved bullshit?

You say that having bitcoin in the name causes confusion, I pointed out that for decades people have managed perfectly well trading and buying currency when some of those currency's share a common name. The only people trying to cause confusion is assholes like you being sucked into a circle jerk to take your attention away from the fact BTC is crumbling. Big names are dropping BTC as a payment option, the mempool is backlogged with a huge number of transactions, fees are through the roof but you and your moronic comrades just keep reading your controlled censored sub and thinking everything will be ok if we keep focused on thinking the problem is BCH !! Incredible !!

I've given you a perfect example why your argument is stupid but you still not ready to see the light, I see that.

And yeah I see the benefits for BTC if they can disassociate the word ""bitcoin"" from bitcoin cash. And yes especially for new people, your core masters don't want new people thinking. They don't want new people to think there is another bitcoin, a better bitcoin. They don't want people to do any research and find that bitcoin in the form of BTC doesn't work anymore but bitcoin cash does.

I'm flying to the US in the new year, I will be careful when I go online to buy some dollars, I wouldn't want to end up with any of those Hong Kong dollars"
People do not often confuse money from various countries so it is not a problem actually. On the other hand, people do often confuse bitcoin and BCH. I hope I havnt lost you, I really am trying to keep this very simple.
"It hasn't evolved to become bcash, calling it bcash is a deliberate attempt by core supporters to cause confusion and to try and ""claim"" the name bitcoin for themselves. BCH is just as much bitcoin as BTC and if you say bitcoin is what satoshi laid out in his white paper then BCH is more bitcoin than BTC.

You need to look at your own sub and the bullshit going on there. /r/bitcoin has become a huge circle jerk of new accounts , where are all the people who been around bitcoin for years ??? Simple they gone or they here. 

"
You are theorizing about a hypothetical world that you think should exist, I am pointing out what is actually happening. People do not often confuse various fiat currencies, although sometimes they do. However, not enough that it is causing problems.
"I honestly do not know if you think you are making a valid argument or if you are just portraying an exagerated caricature to show how ridiculous it would be for someone to try to defend what is happening in this sub.

However, just incase you really are trying to make points and to learn, here you go. Yes, the reason that BCH has evolved into being called bcash is to reduce confusion. If both coins had merit to stand on their own, then both communities would want to have their own individual identity. It is very obvious which community is trying to separate the identities and which is trying to piggyback on the other. Claiming to be unable to see this difference is not believable, sorry, it is such a simple concept, I can not accept that this is to difficult for you to be able to understand. Ethereum could have called themselves 'Bitcoin Money' or 'Bitcoins', but they didn't because they were proud of their coin, they wanted it to stand on its own merit."
He gets it
Do something noteworthy as vitalik did/does, and you may get quoted. 
So do I. Make a post about me.
"What do you mean no use? It’s very useful to transfer high values even with the large fees. If you want to sell or buy something of high value you want to do that on the most secure chain with the biggest hashing power. BTC has 10x more hashing power with virtually no chance for a 51% attack. BCH’s chain can be rolled back by any medium sized miner at any time over and over if they want to. Any relatively small new mining entity could anonymously screw with BCH and nothing can be done about it. 

BTC also has 10x volume, processes 10x number of transactions per day, has 10x number of nodes. It would be crazy not to trust it more.

On the long term it will be the most transacted coin with Rootstock, LN and bigger base blockchain that is planned (part of the official Core scaling plan)."
"Every fork is a contender in theory. Whichever fork has the most work behind it is Bitcoin. Given BTC has 1.54x more work accumulated already, it’s very hard to imagine how BCH can match and ever overtake BTC.

Also, the more time goes by the less likely BCH’s chain will ever be called BTC because of market and psychological reasons. This is especially true if companies like Bitpay and Coinbase introduce BCH under the Cash name. There is no turning back.

I think at this point the chances of ‘flippening’ are below a percent, and within a month or two it will be virtually zero. Whoever is counting on it is a huge risk taker, or delusional.

This doesn’t mean BCH can’t be a successful 3rd or 4th most used alt one day. ETH will be no. 1, LTC no.2 and BCH will compete with Dash, IOTA or others to be no. 3.

BTC in number of on-chain transactions will probably be 5th or 6th. However if counting Rootstock, LN and other off-chain transactions, and in volume, and in value transacted BTC will remain no. 1. "
true
You have a point. Thanks
"well he got bullied into an apology for this statement, and made it the following day :( 

still, he was initially right of course )))"
"I don't necessarily agree. how can BTC remain stable for so long. How would someone prefer that to $ or BCH or ETH after the craziness and hype goes away?

BTC is nothing, no use, no value."
Pff, Vitalik is such a shill. /s
Oh whoa! I didn't know he said this.  When Vitalik likes you, you know you're on the right side.  I think branding ourselves as legitimate contenders might be a lot better than trying to claim to be the real bitcoin might be a better strategy to get people to understand bitcoin cash.
This endorsement matter. A breath of fresh air in a community that has been hijacked by corporate interests. The idea behind the creation of Bitcoin is the exact opposite of the current state of affairs. Vitalik has always been in the right path. Great news for Ethereum and Bictoin (Cash). 
Smart and humble man, true bitcoiner
 Less appeal to authority and idol worship please.
I don't think you understand the role of leadership. Idolizing is irrational. Recognizing the leaders is essential. Ships have captains. They are useless without the crew, but they are crucial.

Per S9 miner? I'd hate to see the odds of finding a block with my BCH full node with the internal CPU miner turned on... :P

So you’re saying you’re going to post an invoice showing you received 2 s9’s for $1250 each?
"> people thought they shouldn't withdraw every day

Not quite true. Nicehash sets a threshold of 0.01 BTC to withdraw to an external wallet, so most casual users would need to mine for a couple months before they're able to do that (and they're thus forced to store their BTC with Nicehash until that date). You can withdraw to your Nicehash online wallet for a threshold of 0.001 BTC instead, but then there's like a ~$10 or ~4% fee (whichever is higher) to move it into a real wallet, putting you back at square one. "
You go out of business if you lose 500 bucks? You must be joking. 
"> The probability is high because it already happened before.

This is a fallacy. Just because it happened before doesn't mean it will happen again, and it doesn't necessarily mean the risk is imminent either.

I'm not trying to tell you how to run your business, I'm just saying that there are multiple ways of looking at this, and since your business is just emerging and fragile as you say, maybe it would be better if you would analyze the situation from multiple angles. Good luck."
The pool gets back the fees for blocks it mines, so it can just include the payout transactions in the blocks it's mining. 
"With POS, the person with the most capital makes all of the decisions.

I prefer POW because it allows relatively friction-less entry and exit of miners."
"https://youtu.be/bSdwqa3Yl0Q

3 minutes in.

It's effectively making similar economic incentives and disincentives without the requirement to perform hashing with nonsense until you happen upon a valid hash."
"PoS simply takes the fundamental idea of ""one hash one vote"" and changes it into ""one day-old coin one vote"". The more and older coins a wallet has, the lower difficulty it is required to mine at to confirm a block; when a block is found, it includes a stake transaction that spends the staked coins into the coinbase of the block (effectively resetting the age of the coins).

With PoS, any ""miner attack"" that exists has an equivalent ""money attack""."
"Oh I understand now. Yeah I don't keep my coins in the pool very long either, but I'm mining at coins with a much smaller fee. 

Did you start with asic mining or GPU mining?"
Same with my Credit card or cash.
"He should be able to go about 30 days before bills are due and he should have budgeted for ""start up"" costs."
It's a very modest risk given the amount he's talking about. All businesses have third party risk at some point. It's not like he's putting up his life savings one day, waiting for his payout 12 months later. 30 days of third party risk is not that big of a deal.
The beauty if bitcoin isn’t that you don’t trust anyone, it’s that you aren’t *forced* to trust anyone.

"Read the incentives portion of the White paper.

You would make far more money , with a much gentler profit curve on BTC. BCH mining is also too erratic because of the quick over compensating DAA it has employed. 

The blocks are also filling up to 2Mb in BCH now and they are lagging behind. The profit ratio gets pretty fucked up when the blocks slow to @3 or less an hour and payouts stall.  

I've mined every Sha/256 coin. Kept ahead of the profit curve for well over two years. 

As for pools centralizing mining, one unknown entity had been the primary miner for BCH since it's beginning.  BCH had been controlled up to 95% by one entity at times, that's as centralized as you can get."
"Even their own sad ""non-mining nodes are important"" pseudonarrative conflicts with what their broken software is obviously doing to bitcoin. "
Well atomic swaps trading works with UTXOs that can be compared to fixed-size coins & banknotes in a cash trade, so if you have many small UTXOs it's like having many small value coins for a cash trade rather than a single 100$ bill. So miners have their BarterDex inventory ready for trading. The whitepaper has a long explanation: https://www.komodoplatform.com/en/technology/whitepapers/BarterDEX-Whitepaper-v0.4.pdf
"One of the pools got hacked, and everything that wasn't saved to a personal wallet got stolen.

I am using a pool..."
"Basically one of the core developers during some conference thing explained how instead of scaling the blocksize, companies could make ""tabs"" and just keep a record of what you owe instead of, you know, using bitcoin."
"Do a Google of ""Adam Back Tabs"" and you'll find a video of him that some people are having a field day with."
"That's his claim to fame. Adam didn't even think bitcoin could work despite being sent the white paper in 2008.

It wasn't until mid 2013 when bitcoin traded above  $1000 that Adam got involved. "
What, does that make his tabs proposal more relevant? It's still one of the most idiotic things said in the crypto sphere.
"Did you also know that until recently he implied on his Twitter page that he basically invented Bitcoin? The line was 'Bitcoin is hashcash extended with inflation control'. Unfortunately he didn't even invent hashcash.

Well your bank can freeze your credit card. Bitcoin cash can't. What other incentive do you need? No government can decide your money is not yours.
Divide the network hashpower by your own. It totals up to less chances per block than winning the lottery for 1 S9. :p

An s9 is definitely profitable if your electricity isn't outrageously priced.
I have another card, debit, (3 different banking institutions) also cash. If I need a coffee I can use any of those. I think I have a gift card as well, though Bitcoin cash is a better gift card than the one I have because it works at all coffee shops, fair point there.
You must be doing something wrong in the math.  If you can make $90 per day via pool, and bch is whatever $1500, then you should get a block once every year and a half or so on avg, right?
Good to know. Are they actually available to buy? 
Your life sounds complicated.
Well regardless, I have electricity/infrastructure costs to pay... Every month.

"Because I'm a normal person. The more important question is what situation caused all 3 banks to freeze my credit and ban me for suing money. If I was doing something 'untowards' that would get the spotlight on me I would certainly look at alternate payment options. But if we're going down *that* road, Bitcoin/BCH/varients are not the way to go. Need Monero or something like that.

If something in society has got so wrong people like me lose access to the financial system, coffee is going to be the last thing on anyone's mind. Curiosity, do you think my BCH Visa will work if all the other credit card companies and banks block me?"
"Did you know Mr Back rejected the whitepaper when he was given a chance to read it in the summer of 2008 months before the whitepaper was public?

Did you know Mr back didn't try to get any bitcoin until they hit $1000 in 2013?

Did you know Satoshi only put him as a source in the whitepaper because he had once doen work that could be useful in bitocin (where it had never been useful to anyone else)"
"Blockstrean inc.  suggests that people ""use a tab"" (keep track of who owes how much on paper) to avoid transaction fees.   He was 100% serious when he said it.  I was floored.   That is when I realized the game is over for bitcoin as we know it.

That's probably the only part of the white paper he's read.
"His profit is like $2400/month. If he was able to afford a mining set up, I'm sure he has a normal job and doesn't have a problem with starvation for the first 30 days of operation.

"The way to look at this is that the risk is caused by the high fees and these were caused by non-other than Gregory Maxwell.  It is entirely reasonable for  people robbed by exchanges and pools to blame him for their losses.   (And in the unlikely event that LN gets off the ground, when people lose funds in channels because hubs get hacked and the network can't allow timely recovery, the people who are robbed will equally well be justified in blaming Gregory Maxwell.)

Frankly, if I were he, I'd be getting out of Dodge before the shit hits the fan..."
Well I tried mining with my R9 390 on nicehash, saw the payout, did some math, decided it wasn't profitable with a GTX 1070 compared to ASIC, bought ASIC.

You wont get 1 block in a lifetime with 1 S9. You need 100 S9 miners to mine solo the same amount as in a pool.

Okay Jihan. My bad. Good luck with your mining fortune.
Haha, because that's BCH's *real* competition. The credit system, the under banked. Gotta convince people like me, those that like using crypto, are comfortable with it, have been using it for years, that paying for purchases with Bitcoin cash is any better than the credit card I have now.

I made the mistake of auto mining the most profitable coin (bch or btc) before realizing the fees would kill my profits.  Since that first day, I've exclusively mined  Bitcoin Cash and I couldn't be happier. 

I only wish I had a few more S9's!"
I honestly never thought about this, don't some pools pay fees for you? 
The pool gets back the fees for blocks it mines, so it can just include the payout transactions in the blocks it's mining. 
I'm in the same boat, due to high withdrawal fees I had to switch to only mining BCH. I can send a daily payout if I wanted to for sub 1 cent fees. 
"I hear you.
I had the same issue and thus have switched to BCH a long time ago and stayed even if it got less profitable.

And in addition to the withdrawal fee there will be consolidation fees down the road when you want to use the daily inputs."
Where do you live and what’s a day of power run you?
I was looking for a good pool to mine BCH, where are you mining?
"Unintended consequences coming to bite Bitcoin Core in the rear.
If it falls apart too quickly, they might actually have to do something about the block size quickly.

And that might lead to Bitcoin Cash being irrelevant.
But now that the /r/bitcoin subreddit has poisoned the well, I'm wondering if they're going to cut their nose off to spite their own face and end up seeing Bitcoin core fade to obscurity by refusing to increase the blocksize at all cost.
"
What pools are you using now?
NiceHash has never been hacked. Until it did. 
Slightly offtopic. But is there any thought about adding pos instead of pow? Like Ethereum's casper?
What’s bitcoin core? Is that a new coin?
"It's also a matter of perspective. In your mind, the only solution to avoid losing money is to make daily withdrawals over a congested network. Of course that won't be profitable.

However, another pool hack is probable, but unlikely. You can just as well withdraw once at the end of the week and tilt the scales in your favor with not as a significant risk.

In the unlikely event that the pool you're mining in gets hacked, worst case scenario is you get set back a week, which in the grand scheme of things isn't that a big of a deal.

Of course, you can keep mining BCH and carry on with the daily withdrawals according to your plan, but saying you're ""forced"" to mine BCH is just something that's in your head."
Dude , stop calling bitcoin core . There is bitcoin and altcoins , and bitcoin cash is one of them . Bitcoin is bitcoin , there is no bitcoin core . 
Sorry, I thought you were actually asking for advice / expressing a problem. Didn’t see which sub I was on.
"So I’m fairly certain the OP doesn’t mine. Even leaving your “profits” in for one day and withdrawing to pay for your “business” expenses every other day makes sense in reducing your immense profit killing expenses. 9 days ago you invested $420 in bitcoin and seemed concerned about it falling in price. 16 days ago you held 3bch that you were thinking of selling for btc.
So now you actually have $10k invested in two s9’s and are overly concerned about how to reduce $20 a day in withdrawal fees?
Voted worst shill troll in this community. Gtfo. Pics of your mining rig “boxes plugged into flux capacitors”."
This problem will probably get worse. It will likely be almost impossible to spend small change (~100$) be cause of the fees. This is pushing users to keep everything off chain on exchanges who can afford such costs. It seems we are recreating banks. 
"So to hear core tell it, that 25% of your profit as a fee goes to the evil big miners who are trying to centralize and control Bitcoin.

Also to hear core tell it, those big evil miners tried to centralize and control Bitcoin by forking to bigger blocks.

Which reduces their fees.

How are both of those true again?"

Very very interesting point.
"Thanks for bringing this to everyone's attention. In retrospect it seems like an obvious issue, but I have not seen it discussed here so far.

/u/tippr tip 10 USD"
This post is underrated. 
"yes. Bitcoin core project has forced centralization upon bitcoin in many ways.

people are inventivised to only use coinbase, not real bitcoin, and to keep their btc on exchange, not keep privkey. its terrible."
"How long have you been mining? How much does your setup run you outside of electricity fees?

I noticed in the OP, you said you don't trust pools but somewhere in the comments, you said you are in a pool. So, basically, you feel you must use them but don't trust leaving the money in place or do you mean something else? "
"Important that I should mention, BTC mining is relatively decentralized.

BTC CLIENTS are centralized. One client implementation means BTC holders are forced to use whatever code core puts out.

Now that BCH is going to be integrated in next release of BarterDex, don't forget to take advantage of a useful feature for miners: https://twitter.com/BarterDex/status/933722675582787584
"I faced the same situation a while back, except I was on a slightly smaller scale of mining so the fee situation was worse.  Eventually, I just gave up on mining BTC completely.  Good riddance to bad rubbish.

BTW,  unless you've had your hardware for a long time and have incredibly cheap electricity,  the fees are coming out of your revenues, not your profits.  At the price I pay for electricity these fees would eat me alive, as I can only mine profitably now during the winter where the electricity offsets (somewhat) the cost of fuel for heating my home.
"
Thanks for sharing, I didn't consider this. Of course, you could always solo mine, but what are the odds of finding a block
What kind of hardware do you use to mine ?
You're obviously doing it wrong, you should be mining a federated cross-chain two-way asset peg, or you know, use tabs.
"If you insist on daily withdrawals you’re probably correct! But how little should you really trust pools, and how much do you really have to risk when considering less frequent withdrawals? Dozens of mining pools out there, many that have never been hacked after many years... this is a bit of an irrational fear to protect a couple hundred dollars of weekly returns that you would have with less frequent withdrawals.

That being said, at exactly equal profitability, i can see why BTC fees tip advantage to BCH... but that also tips the hashrate to it, reducing its profitability accordingly, canceling out this effect. This is a complete non-issue, you can afford to mine whichever coin is more profitable just fine."
"So you have two S9 miners going? Or the equivalent hashrate of@28 Th/s....

You would make more on the BTC chain, right now.  My hashrate is@53 Th/s. And the fees MORE than make up for the profit disparity.  

You would make much more on slushpool than you would on any BCH pool.  

"
Mine with Slush, the original Bitcoin mining pool, has never been hacked.  Set your auto payout thresholds and relax!
"Lol, Charlie Shrem did not go to jail for simply ""Pulling BTC into fiat""."

"Saying

> I'm worries about getting hacked

And

> I'm throwing away 25% of my profit

At the same time is really fucking stupid. Why would anyone give a fuck about one person who can't problem solve. You are making this a way bigger problem than it needs to be."
HAHAHA!
"It's Tabs(tm) ;-)"
"> ~~It seems~~ we are recreating banks. 

FTFY

In Corea you get everything opposite from what they claim to promote, mining centralization is not the only thing.

"It doesn't have to make sense, you just don't use both arguments together, and if someone points out your inconsistency you just go quiet and post somewhere else.

I've considered GPUs with fast switching algorithm to always mine the post profitable coin, and every ASIC. The most profitable one is still the S9 Antminer, and will be for the forseeable future.
Can you elaborate on why not using a pool makes you have to pull it every day?  I'm a GPU miner and I can just mine to any wallet address, so I don't understand this. 
"Same... I haven't thought about it until I started mining.

I made a profit analysis chart for BCH and BTC last night. BTC was just unsustainable.

Thank you for the tip, kind person!

man use an exchange u can switch from bcore to bcash small or no fee then send bcash to wallet.... 
I forgive you.
Lol, for now. How would you do if the miners all came back over to BCH like they did in Nov?
Nah it's the broken one apparently.
Can you explain the difference? I always thought pos sounded like total bullshit. But i don't know anything about it really.
If/when subchains become a thing, you'll be able to solo mine on BCH, and never need to trust pools again.
Why do you need to sell every single day? Doesn't make any sense. I don't pay my electricity every single day, so why do you need to sell every single day?
"The things you mentioned are all true... I don't see how that contradicts anything.

The only thing they can do is hard fork... which is what bitcoin did. If they hardfork, they'll have huge consensus issues.

"Which pool do you mine with? I haven't heard of pool.bitcoin.com being hacked which is what I use. You could let your mining rewards 
accumulate for a week or month then withdraw. Enable things like 2FA with Google Authenticator (remember to backup the seed which is very important if you lose your phone). I mine BCH and only withdraw once I have about 0.03 BCH to save on fees. Also you can majorly save on fees by doing the automatic withdrawal which batches everyone's together rather than manual. I think if pool.bitcoin.com got hacked the onus would be on them to restore lost funds to miners. It probably would be easy to cover the loss for Roger."
Seems like a patch fix. What are they going to do when fees outweighs the profit the pool makes? Insolvency?
A bunch of boxes connected to a 240v outlet... :p
"> You can just as well withdraw once at the end of the week and tilt the scales in your favor with not as a significant risk.

Risk = impact x probability.

The impact of losing a week's worth of income (at this frail beginning of my business) means I go out of business. I need to pay rent, electricity, overhead, etc.

The probability is high because it already happened before.

The risk is therefore at the maximum possible value. 

Not withdrawing every day is basically asking to get robbed.

Nicehash got hacked for a value of 60,000,000 USD because people thought they shouldn't withdraw every day."

I don't understand. Oh, you're talking about the 'bitcoin' word in the bcash name? I don't get that argument at all, I mean it's not bitcoin but neither is bitcoin gold and that's the same thing. No, I just like the idea of bcash - yunno, like $ was the 'a' cash, now we have 'b' cash, or just bcash.
