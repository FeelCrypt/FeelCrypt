Yes, as SuperGandu [points out](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/72tecp/psa_twitter_is_currently_under_attack/dnlk3gw/), putting data on the twatchain is a bad idea
"ignore this troll, we have him on video saying, ""if a twat costs $20,000 so be it"""
Awww. Poor Core Troll with his panties in a bunch.

"> The mods in r/Bitcoin are just bad.

Sorry, no. While I agree with what you claim they do, you're missing out on why they're WORSE. Because they've been systemically censoring and banning users with differing opinions for nearly TWO YEARS now. Its not even comparable. Every popular subreddit devolves to appeal to the lowest common denominator as they get more popular, that's just reddit. 

And this is just funny."
3,000 people currently browsing this sub. Eat a dick.
The mods in r/Bitcoin are just bad.  They allow FUD on titles.  What if scenarios written by people who lack fundamental understanding.
"whoa, you guys got me with one of your clever inside jokes?  good one

No wonder nobody gives a fuck about your stupid bitcoin cash

This sub is like 15-20 of the same jackassess sucking each others dicks about how good their gonna get them evil bitcoiners

if you dorks could see how you look to the outsiders in your little private circle , you'd be appalled.  but you've got your heads so far up each others asses you cant see it"

"Lol no way, that's crazy. I remember seeing the post about the ""most addicted city"" being an Air Force base, but I didn't think much of it. Now it all makes sense, it is where the most astroturfing happens. "
It's a linear algebra pun
WOOSH
So, basically, want John Galt was working on, before he quit unexpectedly from the Twentieth Century Motor Company.
"wow..... just wow

go ahead then lets see this video, this should be funny"
In the marketing meetings, definitely.
Hey, I'm a TweetStream developer and I live in Florida. I need to replace a few windows, and while we're at it I'd like to upgrade my internet to a screaming fast 56K modem. Please donate.
Tweets are not meant for talking about your coffee!
And just as an aside, the Earth is the center of the solar system, not the sun...
omg just starting to realize how devolutionary twatchain technology really is
What's to discuss?  More fork bullshit on a sub that won't even put the correct coin on its banner.  I come to all crypto subs and this one makes no sense.
You think Apple innovates?
*Eglin*
I like SegTwit‚Ñ¢¬© better.
Just in case you missed it: Adam Back shows that the whole twitter scaling is a non-issue because any piece oft information can be compressed by Blockstreams Chief-Troll-Officer Samson Mow: https://mobile.twitter.com/adam3us/status/913190320275427330
Twitter is already run from a datacenter. The character limit should be reduced to 40.
"> You might be worried about efficiency, after all a simple increase of 140 characters would cost much less bandwidth than a picture

Actually, we have a new metric called ""weight"" which we use to measure bandwidth. In that measurement system pictures don't count, so our protocol is much more bandwidth efficient then expanding the character count."
I loled üòÇ
Damn, something actually funny on r/btc. 
"You jest but with careful encoding I could put a *lot* more data into that image part than I could base64 encoding it into text. Plus, you know, I can show a picture as well which is superior to the ascii art.

"
Very funny... :)
Excellent satire.

Your post would have been more authentic if you included TwitLonger. Otherwise, good job!

The Tweet Network is right around the corner. It will make Twitter go to the moon!
u/tokbot tip 20000 üÖ±Ô∏èitcoin
Gild this shit /u/tippr
I honestly believe this analog is a perfect description of how the users in this community completely misunderstand the technology and concepts underpinning bitcoin. Everyday this sub is proving why it's treated like a joke by the rest of the community. Never stop. No one is able to discredit you the way you do.
"""... we are the smartest people in the world"" ... a bit cocky much? "
lol 3000 people reading what kind of asshats you are
is that the one with the underground tunnels for illuminati fun-n-games?
A fine point!
How does an ISP measure bandwidth, weight?
Happy cake day!

You win all the internets, sir.
Just keep telling yourself that. Surely it's not you who are out of touch. It's the tens of thousands of /r/BTC subscribers!
