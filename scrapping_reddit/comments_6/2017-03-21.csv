"What is stopping the majority miners from doing the same?

Why are you operating off the assumption that this stops an attack when there is literally nothing actually stopping one?"
Convince me of what? It is just a bunch of facts and isnt meant to be persuasive.
"> What did changing the PoW do?

See my responses earlier in this chain. If you are new to bitcoin, consider asking someone for some technical assistance. "
"> oligarchy of hashpower

lol, that's the studipest shit I've ever heard."
"Ahaha, let's keep it stupid and enjoy a circle-jerk said /u/RexetBlell

PoW is necessary.  The fact that PoW is there in the first place means that core did good.  You could reject bitcoin outright and help Ethereum with its PoS scheme.  It's really interesting."
Ah gotcha. Thanks for setting the record straight. Sorry about that.
"Why wouldn't they attack the minority chain? They have every reason to.

What did changing the PoW do?"
While unrelated, it is funny that he is actually a religious fundamentalist. So his behaving that ways makes sense.
What?? The whole premise here is that the miner's are attempting to attack the new chain with the new PoW. There is obviously no attack if they keep mining on the old chain.
"This needs to be stickied! 

It sickens me that the masses believe a Hard Fork is more dangerous than a Soft Fork, that it will automatically result in two coins, and will destroy BTC as we know it."
"> which was originally proposed by Samson Mow.

This is not true, it was proposed on a BU slack channel, Samson Mow just tweeted about it(attacking it of course) after I already announced it."
Mining ASICs should be done away with, ideally. But now is most definitely not the time to screw with stuff like that.
"Erik Voorhees seems to misunderstand what the proposal for a PoW change really is about. It's not about ""preventing miners from mining"", but about preventing miners from attacking the other chain after a split."
"The miners pick the PoW though. The PoW of the bitcoin network is not defined by Core. It's defined by the miners because the miner's protect the network.

What?"
Did that convince you? What you just wrote?
"I didn't say it would stop. I explicitly said ""they could still be attacked."" 

All I am saying is that the bitcoin miners have a huge mining advantage, relative to everyone else, due to the equipment they have already purchased. That particular advantage would go away in a PoW switch. "
Satoshi did good. Not Core.
Same with my chain :)
"It's clear you are being purposfully ignorant.

A change in PoW does not stop an attack in any way. Objectively. If you can't see that you should re-learn bitcoin.

There is nothing you can do outside emergency black-listing or white-listing nodes as far as I can tell. Good luck with it, I hope you guys actually try. Maybe then you will figure out what you claim here to be unable to see."
