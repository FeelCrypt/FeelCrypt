What is Credits? I ve heard that its kind of blockchain project
I agree, if you are going to claim onchain, you should be able to mention a few places.
No it's not it xD it makes an on chain TX to the wallet of the card. I can prove it if you'd like. 
"great sign as they were big btc supporters 

WOW"
Okay? I don't have to leave my money on exchange, if that's what you want to do, power to you?
"> Who accepts onchain bitcoin?

Nobody uses Bitcoin. It's a well-known fact. Since 2009"

"Okay? So I have a coinbase account, so when I sent money to that... it makes an onchain TX.

That sounds like lots of work, so I just leave spending money in coinbase."

I haven't tried this one yet. "
That's basically it, yes. I do an on chain TX to the card, it's converts to USD, then I use it like a normal prepaid card
Core boycott incoming in 3...2...1...
"Lol then I do an 'on chain TX' to coinbase.

That isnt an onchain, thats loading up a wallet. Just like LN."
Autoconverts? Sounds like you have a debit card.
"Those were some pretty awful crypto sites.

35 dollars for a 3$ pair of sunglasses? 20$ tshirts? 

These are novelty websites, not merchants. "
Wow huge news for BCH bois!
Ew. Bcash
no its not accurate
And a trusted setup which is far more important detail. Just a PoW coin with premine and false sense of privacy
don't get left behind
you mean like the ethereum sec false report by WSJ last week... stuff happens all the time
"Gemini has the trust license thing,  better than bitlicense

They need to stop asking permission for this shit"
"uhhh you missed the most important part of the quote... ""though details about when these currencies MIGHT go live remain sparse."""
"They could that also if they add LTC from the begginings of their business. BCH actually is not about the low fees and fast transactions, with huge blocks it is about data storing on the blockchain (memo.cash is perfect example). Litecoin, which was created in 2011, has [10x lower fees!](https://chain.so/tx/LTC/a98a95f97d9537e4b123fe11b3c046fca438de2efbdc169e6b3f6cb8ee95c030) and [4x faster transactions!](https://www.coindesk.com/information/comparing-litecoin-bitcoin/). BTW, they added Litecoin (and zcash) as well to their exchange, so well done. Strange, that title does not mention this.

I wonder, why no one has comparing LTC to BTC/BCH here, instead downvotes blindly when you come to community with better alternatives for every day transactions."
Nobody believed Satoshi, and now people cry. Fuck them
Hi guys! They added Zcash too. Check out Bloombergâ€™s new cryptocurrency index. Winkelvoss predict bitcoin to grow 30x! Please watch my video if you want to catch up with all the latest crypto news. https://youtu.be/nrWkwJs0IGQ
Which is exactly why you shouldn't use Bcash.
Gordon Gecko would like a world with you.
Well 620 sounds good, thats 3x? Howd bitcoin do during that time 6x?
I guess... more winning for Bitcoin Cash ðŸ™„

"""Following approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), Gemini will begin accepting deposits of Zcash on Saturday, May 19, at 9:30am EDT.""

They will never allow any real ""privacy"" coins on.. mkay? ;)  "
Cos Satoshi doesn't exist anymore. Keys are seem to be lost or destroyed
don't worry about me, I'll be ok
