>Of course he does.
He will lose, just like he lost BIP101 and XT. Eventually he will lose his MIT job once they realise he is not actually doing research but instead playing lobbyist.

"That's a good possible explanation.  
Power and its responsible use isn't something for everyone. I'm still baffled about theymos fast decline into insanity. I mean, he's still very knowledgeable about Bitcoin but his social skills... I wonder how he was in person some years ago."
I wish reddit had actual, functioning community moderation. Down votes are really good enough though. 
"Roger's /r/btc has been undermined by the enemy, as it seems.

Really bad that such kind of war is fought at reddit. "
ELI5, Roger cannot remove?
"I'm not trying to mislead anyone. I don't know about the ATF conspiracy. I wouldn't put it past them, though. That entire agency should be abolished. 

It doesn't change the fact that shipping explosives (which fireworks are, by definition) in the mail is negligent at best, and put people's lives at risk for no good reason. I'm not going to defend an act I find morally reprehensible because of a baseless conspiracy theory. Maybe it was just an honest mistake on Roger's part, but he's never struck me as particularly remorseful for this crime."

Good question. :(
"I do believe downvotes are aggressively abused here (and on /r/bitcoin).

I think it's unfair to give downvotes simply because one is disagreeing with the point of view in a comment, and even more unfair to systematically downvote every comment from persons one is disagreeing with.

/r/btc has drawn in a lot of people that are in favor of BIP101 and ""bigger block limit, the sooner the better"" - and I tend to find myself in that camp - but still, remember that the ultimate goal for /r/btc is to become the new /r/bitcoin.  It doesn't really work out when the most upvoted posts all the time are either bashing Blockstream or promoting bigger blocks, we need better content than that.

And still, aggressive moderation does not work out, because the raison d'Ãªtre with this group was to avoid the aggressive moderation seen at /r/bitcoin.

Here is some suggestions:

* Create some new sub, i.e. /r/btc_meta for discussing moderation of /r/btc and /r/bitcoin, plus anything else related to the usage of reddit in the cryptocurrency scene.  Declare that all meta discussions are unwanted here.
* Declare that posts that does nothing but promote big block limits or bash the core developers should go to /r/bitcoin_uncensored
* Don't moderate comments too heavily."
"This event makes me question the integrity of /u/MemoryDealers.

Roger, please do not !%/= this up."
"> (and be respected by the users in turn)

that's key.

and i'd add:  trusted."
How is this related to how he moderates?  Is there evidence that he's using his mod power to help his goals in bitcoin? Is there evidence that he suppresses other opinions on the matter?
"It's all very clear from /u/btcdrak's comments:

>We need a technical lobbiest, someone who will go to companies and listen to them and discuss the technology with them. 

Clearly, he thinks that we might have gotten more technically lobbier, but we're not making the *lobbiest* attempts that we can. We're just sort of lobbing development willy-nilly, without any interest in finding local maxima for our lobs."
"From the mod guidelines on this sub. Mods on /r/btc will not:

> Take moderation positions in communities where your profession, employment, or biases could pose a direct conflict of interest to the neutral and user driven nature of reddit.

Seems like making btcdrak a mod here is a betrayal of the rules. I'm not necessarily opposed to people modding here who have strong opinions, but I didn't make the rules."
"#btcdrak banned me. Luckily I have ninja skills so I can still post this:

http://i.imgur.com/B3wBFkx.jpg (conversation leading up to the ban. I said ""go away"")

http://i.imgur.com/WyWOT9K.jpg (the ban itself)

&nbsp;

I requested of the r/btc moderators to un-ban me. This is the post I sent to them:

    I request you to re-evaluate the validity of this ban.

    I don't believe saying ""go away"" constitutes an infraction on any guidelines.
    It's not spamming and it's not trolling.

    It is my belief that the ban originated out of an emotional response to my post,
    and perhaps the fact that I voiced publicly my opinion that btcdrak should not be a moderator.

    r/btc is supposed to be what r/bitcoin failed to be. If we are not free to speak out
    against those who hold positions of trust and power, then we have lost our freedom as a group.

"If you are able to devote a bunch of time doing boring free labour on a topic, you're pretty damn invested in that topic.

This is the same for all moderators on all systems, it's just that Bitcoin has some interesting stakeholders and their passion is financially incentivised."
Its moderators in general tend to be scummy ego-driven bully people.  Usually they were bullied in middle school and then they became a hall monitor and learned they could be the new bullies by cozying up the the system and administration.  By using government and authoritarian power, they seek revenge on the cool kids who made fun of them.  The best mods are those who don't want to be mods.
"> **Mod should be above it.**

This one! If mod cannot differentiate between his role as mod and his role as a user or person, he is simply unsuitable as a mod."
"<taking moderator hat off here>

That's right, we need adequate representation because reddit was overrun with disinformation. Gavin going behind closed doors and telling what what to companies, we dont eve know who. Plus, Bitcoin Core is not great at communicating with the outside world.
"
Yes yes and yes
did you even read what OP posted?
"> and i'd add: trusted.

Damn straight! :)"
It is bullshit. He sold fireworks that were commonly sold online by many other vendors (without licenses) and shipped them legally. He was targeted by the ATF for making anti-ATF statements during a political speech. Do your homework - unless you're trying to purposefully mislead people, which this bullshit certainly has been used for in the past.
"http://www.justice.gov/archive/criminal/cybercrime/press-releases/2002/verPlea.htm

It's not bullshit. He sold explosives on eBay and put postal workers' lives in jeopardy. "
"Ok troll. Nice new post in /r/buttcoin btw.

Question: did you just join Reddit bitcoin71186, or did you have a previous Reddit account?"
Not this bullshit again.
"Well within his rights? Doxxing a customer over $50 screams ""unprofessional"" in ways I can't even begin to describe.
"
[removed]
"I know nothing about this ""doxxing users who owe him $50"" so I can't comment (though I'd suspect he was well within his rights), but as for the public fight with OKCoin, he acted with integrity and simply demanded his due according to the legal contract OKCoin entered into with him. The fact that you think this makes him look bad makes me question your judgment and/or motives.

Question: did you just join Reddit bitcoin71186, or did you have a previous Reddit account?"
I put on my robe and wizard hat
"I see your point now. Thanks for your advice.

But as a trader, it is really important to feel the sentiment of the market. That's why I care how much better/worse this community is becoming. A bad community lowers the value of this new form of money."
Roger has a long line of questionable decisions and talking points, doxxing users who owe him $50, and his public fight with OKCoin was not well reflected on him (even if he was in the right). He does do a lot for Bitcoin, but that doesn't give him a free pass for everything.
"I think it could work ok, just make sure there are some surprise caveats so people can't game it ahead of time.

It's totally do-able IMO."
"/me blushes

I cant see either, my glasses broke"
"Good point. Agree.

A small-blockist mod is not a problem per se."
I didn't say anything about ignoring the crisis, I said ignoring the drama. You can read about the actual important developments between small and big block without getting involved in the drama. 
Care to elaborate?
Someone mentioned the idea of letting users vote for mods. I am not yet certain how this could work (given potential sockpuppets) - but a subreddit with at least a hint of decentralized decision making would be great for Bitcoin.
I posted those questions way before we saw /u/btcdrak actually do any banning here.
I'm not familiar with the guy. What has he done as a mod that's been questionable/bad?
"Bro I'm just making a joke that you can't spell ""lobbyist."" Jesus. I know you're trying to push a political agenda here.... But you can't even read your way out of a reddit comment. Good luck "

I'd like to see this ""disinformation"".

"Roger can remove any mod he wishes. I'm not sure exactly what he means, there's some sort of pun with the ""Verified"" but it's not particularly clever. Perhaps there's something else I'm missing."
"If one ignore the current blocksize crisis, and keep buying bitcoin blindly. 

When the crisis hit, one loses money on his/her investment."

"It's not negligent at all. You just have to declare them and pay the appropriate postage. I get ORM-D packages regularly.

And it's not a ""conspiracy theory"", the ATF agent openly said they were pissed about what Roger said in his speech in front of the DA.

Edit: man, of COURSE he's not remorseful. He really did nothing wrong, was targeted for speech. He was a political prisoner and it jaded him towards how corrupt the political and justice systems, (not to mention the murderous ATF) are. It changed the course of his entire life."
I'll admit that I don't know what a lot of this is about... but it seems like that if /r/btc is all about anti-censorship, why would one person's opinions/comments be used against them - as opposed to their actual actions (which it seems there are plenty).
"Some lyrics by Pete Townshend spring to mind:

This is insane. Why is it so hard to keep a forum decent? Christ.
"What was the reason for the addition? 
Reviewing the mod guidelines, it appears that a few rules have been violated by btcdrak (as demonstrated by linked comments here).

Edit: guidelines not rules. "
"Less the mods, the better it will be. Mods needs to be passive, and not do anything! Very much like /r/Anarcho_Capitalism

upvote
Why upvote can't be seen on this post?
I like the sentiment. An attempt to bring the community together. Wrong choice though. Passive moderation only please.
"Completely agree. Please remove him.&nbsp;

/r/btc with btcdrak is not /r/btc i want to use."
score count magically reappears, so much for someone w/ strong backbone and that doesn't bend to the crowd. . . .   this has to be one on the worst mod appointments - if not the worst - in the history of cryptocurrency and cryptography online communities. 
[deleted]
btcdrak have IMHO been quite a few times been very abusive. Quite surprised he is a mod here with that kind of history.
"I agree as well. We need to have an interesting sub where lots of opinions are respected and discussed, not one where there is heavy handed moderation going on.

It's not bad if unpopular posts are down-voted . . that is part of the free market of ideas. And I think most of us are pretty careful with our downvoting."
Aaand this is now the top post of all time in this sub.
"I don't know the whole story, but the side I've seen makes me pretty sure I agree that he seems unfit. 

As a btc user with no expertise I wonder why the moderators aren't less involved in Bitcoin itself. Shouldn't moderation be based on discussion and not content? I suppose there's a grey area of on topic or not that would take a decent level of knowledge, but that seems to be what the voting system is for. 

It almost makes me want to try my hand at moderating a sub, but that sounds like so much work maybe. I guess I have no idea. "
I'm done with /r/btc. See ya on /r/bitcoinxt
I came here from r/bitcoin so I could get away from controversy. I want a GREAT mod for r/btc not someone the communicate doesn't favour. Sorry btcdrak, it's just not your time, please understand its not personal. 
i dont understand what happened?
Up-voted.
Yeah I agree he shouldn't be moderator, he seems like a huge anti-BIP101 troll, and now he is banning innocents, please remove him ASAP.
I think mods should have a probation period to prove themselves.
"Can't agree more.  He can say and do whatever he wants whether I agree with his negative attitude or not.  However he brings too much negativity to this discussion and no real achievements to warrant such a position.

/u/MemoryDealers can do what he likes but this move will cause me to want to unsub from /r/btc."
">update 4: btcdrak hides the votes on this topic. It's 152 and counting (You can still see it on the right).

Scores are never shown in the post headers for the first 2 hours after being posted. This functionality has been part of reddit since very early if not the beginning and has nothing to do with this subreddit or its moderators."
Yeah this is 100% BS
"Agreed. I'd also encourage people to mail /u/MemoryDealers and *politely* voice your opposition to btcdrak being a mod.

A mod should be non-confontational, polite to users, respectful (and be respected by the users in turn), tolerant (especially of differing viewpoints), non-obstructive (especially when users voice their displeasure on a subject, banning because you don't like what some say is childish and petty, but Bbtcdrak shows he's eager to do just that), and open minded (should readily consider the wants and needs of users, of which is clear in his opening post that he has no interest in fostering the community that currently resides, but instead wants to rebuild the community from scratch in his own image). Btcdrak is none of these things, and his ""welcome post"" clearly demonstrates right off the bat that he is not fit to stand in that kind of position nor is he respected among members of this sub's community. His posts in /r/bitcoin has clearly shown he is an abrasive personality. I personally urge Roger to reconsider appointing him as a mod."
[deleted]
The redditor btcdrak is highly unsuitable to be a forum moderator for anything Bitcoin related, in my opinion. Please remove him as a moderator for /r/btc, Roger Ver. 
This doesent make sense. Any mod would ban you or anyone else for saying go away to their face efter being approached in a respectful manner.
"Not this emotional drama again.

Can't we have one decent Bitcoin subreddit where people moderate with a steady hand?"
Agreed simply because of his comments. Mod should be above it.
fuuuck, why are so many weirdos responsible for moderation on bitcoin related subs?
