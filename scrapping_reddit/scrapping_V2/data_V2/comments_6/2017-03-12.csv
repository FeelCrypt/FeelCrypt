I like how Gavin is trying to calm down the fanatics of either side with this statement. This is exactly the kind of message we need right now. Nobody profits from an all out war between BU and Core. It just makes the Bitcoin community seem petty and childish.
Gavin is practically back. Stop clamoring, let's do stuff which encourages him.
">There is some ambiguity in what a hard fork means

Let's get this straight. ""Fork"" in either soft or hard variations doesn't depend on what happens to the blockchain. It's a software development term.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)

A ""soft"" fork is a fork where both resulting versions of the software can continue to use the same database (the blockchain). A ""hard"" fork results in two versions of the software that disagree on the proper structure of the database, causing the users of each branch to use a different version of the database.

BU is a fork of core. It's considered a hard fork because blocks considered valid by BU will sometimes be rejected by core, meaning that the chain will split if there is contention among the miners. At a 75%+ activation a chain split is unlikely, but that doesn't make any difference: BU is still a fork of core. It's still changed the rules of the database they both work with in a way that the original implementation will reject. This it's always a hard fork and will always be a hard fork.

The only issue with this language (which has been in the Bitcoin space since the beginning) is that the developers of core have been trying to demonize the act of making a fork of their software that isn't 1-for-1 compatible with their implementation. Don't let them control the language; there's nothing inherently dangerous about forking the software (Monero successfully hard forks several times a year with no problems, Bitcoin has previously had firmed with no problems)."
"> transactions greater than 1MB are deemed ""excessive"" and by default are not accepted

Ah, I wasn't aware of that. Yeah, that effectively solves the problem."
No matter how fast your machine is, there's some size, probably around 3MB, where a specially-constructed block will take you more than 10 minutes to verify, and a 4MB block may take several hours.  Eliminating quadratic sigops verification doesn't change that such a block exists, but greatly increases the size where it becomes relevant, likely into the GB range.
(AS)*AP* is 50%. But It think if we get 50%, we'll get 75%, so there's that.
"""Quadratic hashing"" applies only to very large transactions, not blocks.  A block that is twice the size and contains the same mix of transactions as some other block will verify in twice as much time (not four times as much time).  

In Bitcoin Unlimited, transactions greater than 1MB are deemed ""excessive"" and by default are not accepted, thus avoiding the quadratic hashing issue for very large transactions.  "
My hardware doesn't depend on  quadratic sigops verification AFAIC.
That sounds more like core uasf.
"Yes, we don't need a bunch of sell out devs turning bitcoin into something nobody benefits from.

Acting like you represent any kind of user base or organic support is becoming comical. "
Obviously?
"yingsena, you should run bitcoin unlimited.

you can stop accepting blocks over 300kb *today*"
"I don't see why such a block would ever get built on though, so it'd just get orphaned. I guess it lets a miner try to DoS the network but why would they do that?

I don't know... the whole attack vector seems, in practice, to be very benign."
There are definitely fanatics on both sides 
With the evidence presented in this post, you could similarly assert that there are no toxic core people, only BU detractors trying to make them look bad.

I think it is you who's putting words in his mouth now.
"Talking about words in mouth, where in the white paper does it say we have to turn bitcoin into a segfault ""settlement layer"" for banks with centralized layer 2 token systems? "
"It suits them to paint us as irrational and irresponsible - and to portray themselves as the rational ones - it is a technique to maintain control - also, repeating something such as these lies a thousand times is a technique which politicians employ - some mud sticks.  These things work on credulous minds - of which we can see there are many among the core supporters.

Our best course of action is maintain confidence and self belief and to carry on advocating our position and doing what we can to give BU traction.  As time goes on the desperation tactics will get increasingly overt and more and more people will see certain participants for what they truly are. 

While the crack in the dam appears to only let a trickle flow out such that one may feel the water will never drain, we can be sure that the structure is weakened and will inevitably give way entirely - perhaps sooner than we might expect."
Yes, this allows them to dismiss us with seeming authority to their censor followers. 
If there is a UASF, some miners could decide to go after it and the % of UL would increase.
"It seems you are under a misconception.

The objective of BTCfork and /r/btcfork is not ""let's fork ASAP"", but to create the basis for future safe hard forks as a mechanism to upgrade Bitcoin.

We are continuing to work - in public - to bring the pieces for this together, something that Core devs promised to do but failed to deliver on.

P.S. common sense would suggest that a majority-hashrate HF is less risky than a minority fork. In that sense, I am very excited by the grassroots momentum that is building behind big-block supporting clients such as Bitcoin Unlimited, Classic and XT.

I can support such a majority hard fork, secure in the knowledge that future forks will benefit from the continuing research done on hard forks as an upgrade mechanism, whether at /r/btcfork or by others."
"I mostly ignore the ""drama"" posts spit by both sides. The discussions around them are usually not very productive."
I like how Core pepes don't consider themselves to be minions when Core represents the very concept of having obedient followers that ban anybody which speaks out against them.
Clamoring isn't encouraging him? ðŸ¤“

"the only ""let's do this ASAP"" attitude and actions are coming from SWSF pumpers.  ex: BitClub's James Hilliard's TM attack with /u/nullc's follow on BU attack."
"Gavin: ""No, miners alone aren't enough. They know that, they're not idiots."" <- this is what the other side doesn't seem to get. "
"Who is spreading the idea of ""let's fork ASAP""? This shit is taking years and won't activate for months after all of this is settled - assuming nothing changes.

**EDIT** - What I mean by ""assuming nothing changes"" is miners could start voting a different way and the activation could not occur. I think the consensus has to stay for X amount of time until it will take affect."
Gavin come back! ðŸ˜­
"There is some ambiguity in what a hard fork means. Consider that if everyone runs BU with EB>1MB, a bigger block would not trigger a hard fork. 

So the riddle is, when did the hard fork happen? Either (a) it didn't ever happen and we don't need a hard fork to get to bigger blocks, or (b) some miners would already be hardforking as soon as they move to BU with EB>1MB, even though no blocks bigger than 1MB had yet been published. 

I would say (a) is the correct idea. Miners first increase the size of blocks they are willing to accept, then they start publishing the bigger blocks. Rather than speak of ""hard forks,"" it would be clearer to say there is a possibility of a *split* if some miners publish bigger blocks while only part of the network has started accepting bigger blocks. (So obviously miners won't publish bigger blocks until hashpower accepting bigger blocks is at least a supermajority, giving some advance warning for any minority hashpower to get with the program.) The hard fork terminology just confuses things here, as it can refer to something that results in a split or not. "
"yes, the real HF is happening as we speak; each time someone abandons core code and runs a BU node.

edit:  it's also happening in the hearts and minds of users/merchants in offline communitcation channels."
"Dear Gavin, I know you want to calm the crowd down. Reality is you're right. But the BS (bullshit team) needs some smacks around their arrogant faces. 


I'm quite done with their attempts to ridicule the need for bigger blocks and their slow talks. "
I hope this guy is helping with the code and we just don't know it!

"Why can't anyone talk openly about the blockstream conspiracy? Just call it what it is?  I left bitcoin a while ago but i still get this sub on my frontpage; it's sad to see the same pussyfooting for literally *years.*"
Meanwhile, there's a two minute hate underway against /u/gavinandresen in that other place: [Hi Gavin, I miss you. Come back and let's make Bitcoin great again](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/5yyrgl/hi_gavin_i_miss_you_come_back_and_lets_make/) (just remember to leave your dignity at the door).
Yeah well let's fork ASAP anyway.
"Correct - from what I saw the miners won't activate until they have 75% for a full difficulty period (two weeks) AND then after that, two more difficulty periods to let people have time to update to clients that will not reject bigger blocks.

So it will take six weeks minimum from the time we hit 75% consensus.

Unless there's a User Activate Soft Fork - then I *hope* we activate regardless of the consensus, but I don't know if the miners would."
"> I'm ready for bigger blocks...

If that's all it said, I'd probably run it.

And unless they've fixed the quadratic sigops verification, you're not really ready for bigger blocks, anyway, only ""slightly bigger blocks."""
If your coin is so great, people will flock to it.  So, just fork and be done with it.
Agreed. And that's why I used to run BU. I was ready for big blocks but essentially agnostic. Now that miners are mining BU I feel differently. I don't really think BU is the best mining protocol. BU is great for full node users but Id much rather see the protocol maintain a cap of some kind, flexcap or whatever. 
"In that case running BU is like saying ""i never want bigger blocks"" because it will never get consensus. "
"The fanatics ""on both sides"" are actually all just Core supporters paiting the tape as it were. There is no war, just some people who never understood Bitcoin trying to hold back the tide with centralized thinking."
[deleted]
Some of them get it. It just doesn't support their agenda.
"They seem very fond of strawmanning us all as if we are all raving lunatics who want to follow whatever Jihan wants. Or Roger. Depending on the context. 

"
"The Core side has been discounting Gavin's expertise for a long time.

In the process they have exposed their own lack of good faith quite sufficiently."
Intentially obtuse
"With SegWit voting introduction on Nov 18th 2016, there is a 1 year deadline for 95% activation or it fails. 

Hash support is stagnating and 95% looks extremely unlikely so Core is considering extreme measures meant to bypass the regular voting mechanisms (like UASF)"
"' dur, why dont you fork right now'

'Hurr, just fork already'

'Skreeeeeeeeeee'

"
"Well the idea of forking the software is yet another (related and conveniently conflated) idea, but I take your point that this is the reason they use these incongruous terms. They are so narrowly focused on the code that they have stretched these software terms into the network consensus space with its market and social dynamics. 

They still use the term inconsistently, saying BU will trigger a hard fork (by which they usually mean to underscore the potential for a split), rather than BU being a hard fork. And that's not even getting into the fact that it is users doing the triggering, not inherently BU. This is entangled further with their concept of ""consensus,"" a bastardization of Nakamoto consensus, which they [have never understood](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5yyotu/if_blockstream_core_offchain_solutions_are_any/deu0hpn/)."
