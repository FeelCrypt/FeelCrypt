"Bought my first ^^^^0.444 BCH in 2017. Time to see where I land in 6 years. 

Cheers everyone, lets not get cocky yet but I'm looking forward to the future."
Gee thanks.
I mean BCC is not BTC
AXA bought over blockstream - they've been on the side of the big banks since then trying to fuck up bitcoin from what its original intention was. Search this sub for more info
Monero is being used more these days as well on the darkweb..
Yes you are correct it was adopted by silk road and the darkweb vendors but without them it would have not developed into it is now today and is still a key fundamental..
Thank you, not looking to exchange just looking to buy
Oh sorry, I had no idea. Ill just stick to BCH when im in a rush on mobile, although that use to confuse me since some exchanges use BCC ticker.
Oh right. The truth. Totally forgot about that. Let me guess - the truth comes from Roger and Jihan? Really two nice guys to trust...
"which truth? 
did you mean that BCH is also a way behind ETH, in terms of Technologie, Efficiency, community, company acceptance, DEV, and on chain scaling."
"Up vote for you (amongst the down votes).  If there is anything that we should take from all this is that mining represents a weak point in the supposed ""decentralization"" of crypto currency.  It clearly has fostered greed, control and lack of fluidity (through regressive fees) - things that Bitcoin were said to revolutionize.  Any solution without a block chain is the next generation of crypto. "
Without being top coin, technologically, Bitcoin is probably dead in the water.
BTC can not survive as a minority chain because it has no EDA like BCH
He was right. Its now at 50% of its peak just 12 hours ago. 
I predicted this after the letter about 2x
"Yep. The fact that a big bunch of old-school bankers have crystal clier ties into Blockstream and the Bitcoin Core and segwit and the resistance to bigger blocks (which will funnel traffic into their proprietary side channels, for their financial gain and for further centralization and hubs) is not relevant, I guess. 

The only thing that can remotely be connected to the possibility of ""centralization"" with BCH is that you can no longer run full nodes on a Raspberry Pi. You will actually have to pay for an Intel computer with some memory and an SSD. Oooh, scary scary centralization."
"lmao. I read the comment as was like ""i'm gonna tip this guy."" then I looked at your name as was like ""hmmm, that sounds familiar, guess it's his lucky day."" "
"It was giving to me as a tip lol, I merely think the premise of Hodling like a dollar seems dumb.

"You need a wallet address to send or receive coin.  

The tipping uses a bot, which maintains an account for each tipper/tippee.  To start tipping, you send coin to the bot.  Those coins go in your account with the bot, and you can withdraw them whenever you want.  

When you send a tip, the bot just creates a new account for the recipient and transfers the coins (off chain, in its internal database) from the sender's account to the recipient's account.  So I could withdraw my coins to my own wallet (on chain).  You do this by PMing the bot.  "
LMAO.   Core deserves this.  Imagine being the fool that has 500 bitcoins and thus then 500 free BCH and was so arrogant to sell all the BCH months ago?  Are you one of those guys?  Lol.   
^ Reddit account for 6 days.
Best of luck to us all. Diversity my friend. 
2012er here. Done with Core and their shenanigans. Got rid of the last of my BTC when Segwit2x fell through.
2013er here, after 3 years of bullshittery I will no longer go back to that chain full of assholes again ever. If BCH ever fails I'll just go down with the ship, I have enough fiat left to not be homeless. It's not like Corecoin has any hope to ever upend the fiat world order anyway.

I have been trying to get bitcoin but I’ve gotten less than a dollar in total
Do you buy it?"
"While Bitcoin Cash seems like an okay bet, I've been putting my stake against Bitcoin for a long time now. Ethereum seems like it will be the prevailing technology is my guess; It has a stable growth and a very dedicated team of developers, along with the support of several businesses equally interested in Ether as a medium for transactions as well as the Ethereum blockchain technology. I personally believe it is the future! We're working on rebuilding the entire internet on it right now (Web3 and dApps). Besides it's ability to utilize smart contracts, it will hopefully replace currency as we know it through it's decentralization!"

I am very excited to see BCH develop in the next few months.

I'm very excited to see where BCH goes with it, and hoping that some good merchant adoption can be had.  

Right now I think Coinbase and BitPay are really the most important players for the possible mega success of BCH..."
"
>People in shitty countries or poor countries cannot get BTC or BCH because the barrier of entry is so high.

Only because original BTC has lost merchant appeal and has been turned into a digital investment grade metal with a high barrier to entry.

BCH is merchant friendly so anyone with something to sell - a sandwich, a fish, or an hour of their time - can get paid directly in coins. This was always the path to widespread adoption."

Thanks for supporting inflation. Why do people make the same mistakes as in the FIAT world? 
"Quite true.  My investing strategy is not coupled to my excitement or lack thereof.  

I worry about the long term health of BTC though.  Right now I don't see any answer to scaling.  If more companies adopt SegWit that will help, for a while, but we'll have the same problem in another year (and the developers don't seem to consider it a problem).   If financial activity starts to move to BCH, then Bitcoin is in trouble.  "
"> At the end of the day it's about personal net wealth, right?

By enrichment of us all"
"FWIW I haven't sold anything, as I said at the end I'm still considering my options.  Until anything changes, I am still buying BTC and ETH on a weekly basis (and will soon be buying BCH too).  I've got a bunch of BCH on my holdings from before the fork.  Obviously it hurts to watch the price tick away (another $50 since my last post).  But I am in for the long haul.  If I sell anything, it's going in another crypto, not fiat.  

And you're right we don't know the answer.  This is all a grand experiment, it's never been done before.  Maybe Core team is right and on chain scaling is a bad idea in the long run.  I don't know.  

But what is bothering me is not the price, it's the attitude.  I got into BTC years ago because I liked the censorship-resistant honey badger future of money.  I'm sad now because BTC (and to a larger part, the BTC community) has become the censorship-supporting defeatist alarmist group that calls any proposal not from Core a 'hostile attack', pushes crap like UASF (which would have caused chaos), is happy to censor and ban people who push ideas they don't agree with and DDoS nodes that spread new proposals, and while the developers mostly insulate themselves from this, they also don't speak out against it.  

On a more practical note, what BTC has right now is momentum.  There is one simple action that could flip that- Coinbase and BitPay start trading and accepting BCH.  If that happens, I think it's game on again- BCH will once again be a useful currency for transactions.  If that happens, then Bitcoin's future basically rests with Lightning- if Lightning doesn't work, then people will quickly move on from BTC to BCH simply because it scales.  "
People don't believe horrific consequences when smart people talk about math. Current flippening **is nothing** comparing to the future crypto/fiat flippening. Wars may break out, be ready
Can i sell my btc to you with the rate $6500? I only have 1 btc.

What the heck just happened
If inflation was a mistake why did every country in the world switch off the gold standard?
I LOVE THIS MANNN!
No I don't think CSW is Satoshi.  I like BCH because I think it's solving a problem that BTC is ignoring or not considering a problem.  What do you think is wrong with the BCH developers?
Why?
If I may ask, give me the basic briefing:  Why is Nexus good?  Give me your sales pitch... :)
"> You can use btc or bch for everyday transactions.

Except lately half the time I'll be paying $5+ for my BTC transaction and sitting in the store for half a day waiting for it to confirm..."
"> The honest and can't rebuttle answer is we don't actually know which side is correct.

Nope but it's possible to make an informed bet that the side that lives inside a disinformation bubble where they literally throw out everyone who disagrees is likely to end up making the first mistake.

It's also possible to make an informed bet based on one's own personal understanding of the technical issues."
What's this about losing. If you went all in on BCH at 600 you've almost trippled your investment. If anyone that got into BCH is crying, it's from tears of joy. If you're an idiot that bought in during the pump to 2800, then lesson learned. 
"> Teach them the biggest lesson in trading and that is emotions stay out.

Hodler not a trader here. His opinion is based on fundamentals, not emotion. Although he expresses sadness in his post, his reason to divest from btc is because it's not working per the fundamentals that he believes in, as it did when he first discovered it. 

> What everyone should have done was hold both and stop thinking we know everything. 

Yes when there's uncertainty. But with 2x cancellation there is no potential path forward. The scaling proposals from Core are stalling strategies, to distract from the elephant in the room. Even if we're wrong about that there has been a clear shift denouncing its use as cash. No-one knows everything but at some point you've gotta make decisions based on the information you have at the time. 

The fundamentals say to sell. The only factor is derivatives on top of btc may push the price higher before they realise the emperor has no clothes. So DCAing may be right thing...but it still feels like catching a falling knife.

Let me tell you something that might help. A core developer is ANYONE that codes for bitcoin,  it isn't just a group of four or 5 guys that decide what is what. Same goes for any other decentralized coin.  Now for updates I recommend following developers that only post on the tech and not the price or attacking other currencies. If they do,ignore it. No one knows what is going to happen in the future. I recommend watch Andreas Antonopolous on YouTube, learn do much about the technology and how disruptive it could be

It's the same as a business losing 300M in cash, it doesn't hurt the price of the dollar because it wasn't the dollars fault, it was the fault of the company. In this case, it may have hurt investor interest, but the technology behind Ethereum is sound, and only getting faster!

Beside price spikes with means nothing else than fat finger trader, what is the rationale behind using Bitcoin Core vs Bitcoin Cash? I don't see how in the future people would picker over the expensive and un-reliable one...
At some point soon even with just 8mb blocks you will need 500gb of ram to store all the UTXO set which has to be on ram-like fast accessable storage. But yeah lets just hope and pray and hope and pray that tech will evolve fast enough before your 8mb blocks become a problem. no one using BCH anyway so who cares. Even Gavin had his UTXO UH-OH! moment but then just dismissed it because that technical fact didn't fit his agenda.
How when some noob developer can lock out and destroy 300m in  investor coins accidentally& forever non reversible. i could imagine engineers explaining that one, so dry listening to devs talk about code.   I get investing a risk but dam.... different than a business tanking compared to one single human mistake.

Now it is time to support Litecoin by buying some with your USD or EUR (Fiat in terms of EUR, USD, JPY, CHF, SEK, etc) or support new ideas of freedom, which combine different values in different countries aka ICO.

This is a story of an invention beyond quick profits on trading crypto to crypto.

The Invention, the new source of hope for mankind stuck in capitalism for a moment, is defined by Proof-Of-Work.

No Replay Protection needed due to definition - defined in the charter of peace between: Lord Roger Ver and the Kings of the NYA & Conqueror Satoshi Nakamoto and his Blockstream Alliance beating Goldman Sachs and JP Morgen in the battles of November 2017.

This is getting expensive for Jihan and Roger.
I’m a lurker here... where do you buy Bitcoin Cash and what the hell does “mining” mean?
How does one purchase bitcoin. I have no idea how tipping works. How would you take the money out. I just don't get it  
I am really sorry for your loss
Still hold more $$$$ since I bought my BTC in 2009 and will keep it during this dip . BTC is not bitcoin, but keep fooling yourself .
Translation: I want another rapid rise in value and have no gratitude toward what made me so much in the past.
"I definitely agree that Bitcoin has been hijacked and is now just a speculative mechanism for the big boys and everyone who bought into it in the early days are too fucking greedy and scared to support anything else.

Blind Bitcoin and Core supporters are just like Climate Change deniers."
Where can I find a ELI5 to understand whats going on with bitcoin, why theres a bitcoin cash, and other important facts about this whole situation?
"To be fair, this is a positive sign.

This is what happens when you begin to get widespread adoption. I can look back into any community with nostalgia while it was still niche, and only those who were genuinely interested participated. Now you have everyone coming in, and stuff like this happens.

Don’t be too down, it happens with everything. Think hip hop, EDM, gaming, movies, etc. It’s becoming more mainstream, which we want with crypto. These are not necessarily bad things, just things. I’m hopeful that the original vision will work itself out."
Putting a modest amount in both bitcoin and bitcoin cash! We got this fellas! 
"Sorry if I sound like I don’t know anything. I am pretty new to this 

I have bitcoin through coinbase, but I want to buy bitcoin cash, how do I do that since it is not offered through coinbase?

Thanks "
I have to say I've come to see that Bitcoin cash is truly what bitcoin should be. I was the kind of guy stuck on the old and because it was first. But I have seen that you need to progress with the future. 
solid point... if you believe in the tech

"I do hope the unbanked and underbanked who had bitcoin before the fork did not sell their bitcoin cash.

It would be a shame if those who needed a non-inflationary currency and bought bitcoin are being burnt by this recent shift.

It would be hurting the very people who could have benefit most."
"Where can I find a good explanation of the differences between BTC and BCH?
"
Hodling my 0.0017 BCH like it is actually gold!
I️ don’t get I️t. Even Bitcoin Cash is years behind the tech that other projects have.
"It is so weird to wander into the other sub and see how adamantly they defend Bitcoin OG. They're so threatened by any other coin that they work themselves silly denying the legitimacy of others. They did it with Eth and other altcoins, and now they've turned against BCH because it's finally doing something- therefore it's a pump and dump.

Nevermind that BTC has gone from $3000->almost $8000 on... What? An impending fork so people would get free money? Slow transactions, high fees, and a super toxic community? They deny any value growth outside of Bitcoin OG and they don't even understand their own growth.

Personally I'm still long Eth and BCH. Bitcoin 1.0 was great but it's going to be replaced because other coins are willing to innovate and do it quicker."
Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin. What you sold was Segwitcoin, a silly and relatively short-lived fork. I too got Segwitcoins for free. Sold some, but the rest is unspendable now (fees too high, not enough room for transactions)
Bought my first for $80 in 2013, sold my almost last for $7250 in 2017. (I have still little to sell, waiting for confirmation that never seems to come. Now over 50 hours in mempool)
How do you acquire bitcoin and how is .05 bit coin 85$
Amen brother, Ryan X Charles is another example of the type of excellent people who are contributing to BCH, where we can finally rebuild Satoshi's vision of a world wide, high velocity, digital cash, hard money system.  /u/tippr gild
#
Wow, and I'm sitting here admiring my 0.01 BCH that I managed to scrape by to get.
I expected a little bit of a pump, but picture this. I am at work, as a manager, checking my phone every ten seconds like a crackhead needs his fix. My co-workers are trying to work out what the hell I am up too.. a new girl perhaps.. no.. just crypto.. :D
"I think Mr. Charles is right.  

I got excited about BTC years ago because it finally offered the possibility of fully decentralized finance- no need for Wells Fargo or JP Morgan or Goldman Sachs.  Normal people and businesses could transact without needing anyone else's help or approval.  

For me, an American with a good job and credit, that is mildly interesting.  For someone in a country with shitty economic policy / corrupt financial system, or who cannot get a bank account for whatever reason, it's *revolutionary*.  Just as the Internet took away the borders of communication, Bitcoin can take away the borders of money.  

So I bought and I started HODLing.  I told my favorite companies to please start accepting BTC.  I told others to get into Bitcoin because it's the future.  I laughed with everybody as we said 'TO THE MOON!!1' because we all knew that's where we were going.  I looked at companies like Visa and laughed, because they were the past and we were the future.  We were *excited*.  

Then the bubble popped.  I was told I can't use 0-conf to pay for coffee because nobody should use 0-conf (including the people who were using it).  I was told I shouldn't send microtransactions on Bitcoin.  I was told that gambling on Bitcoin is spam and should be filtered out.  I was told that I shouldn't use Bitcoin for small day to day transactions because I'm wasting block space and I should use Visa instead.  I was told that paying $5 per transaction is a good thing and the network is working as designed.  The companies I told to start accepting Bitcoin mostly stopped accepting Bitcoin.  

Right now, this is not the rocket I wanted to be on.  I wanted the rocket that goes TO THE MOON!!1, not the rocket that's too small to even make orbit let alone hit the moon.  

I want the old days back- the days when we'd tackle problems together with enthusiasm rather than defeatism.  The days where we'd boldly innovate rather than being paralyzed for months/years by fear of technical problems.  The days when we boasted we were impossible to stop or censor, rather than fear [getting banned for promoting the 'wrong' proposal](https://i.imgur.com/B1WlwOM.jpg).  The days when voting for proposals was called decentralized democracy in action, not a hostile attack.  

I don't think those days are returning to Bitcoin, not anytime soon, not with the history they've created in the last few years (especially /r/Bitcoin).  And at minimum, it would require a change in moderation policy.  Don't get me wrong- I hope Bitcoin succeeds, I hope Lightning works as well as promised, and I hope the Core devs can build something really cool.  

But I only see that *excited* attitude in altcoins.  Go talk to an Ethereum fan and you'll hear all about innovation, smart contracts, ICOs and new tokens, and the future of investing.  While we fight each other, those guys are innovating.  I want to do that again.  I want to stop fighting enemies within the walls, and worse people who think I'm the enemy because I want my coffee paid in Bitcoin, and get back to innovating.  

Maybe, hopefully, Bitcoin Cash will hold the future I'm looking for.  I really hope it does.  But for now, I'm losing excitement for Bitcoin.  I see the mempool filling up and the user experience going to shit and the price dropping and I don't see anyone with the power to fix it even considering it to be a major problem.  

So, for the first time in several years, I am considering actually SELLing at least some of my BTC, most likely to buy BCH and ETH.  

//edit- while writing this, the price of BTC went down another $100.  :("
Looks like pump and dump and market manipulation actually
"I don't have an opinion in this and my comment will probably get buried but why are controversial opinions downvoted to hell?

The downvote is supposed to be used for inappropriate or unwanted interventions not civilized and justified counter arguments; no matter how wrong they can be"
So is bitcoin one of those internet cashcrate sites where you fill out a survey and they give you like 2-3 cents for each one, but you use like 15 gpus and a bot so it fills out like 400 surveys an hour? Or am I just totally not understanding what a bitcoin is..
BCH is going to dump so hard. If you are trading this stuff, you better sell soon. 
Best place to buy Bitcoin Cash with fiat?
"You sold close to the top.
"
What do you think is the realistic value before the November 13th fork? https://coincodex.com/article/1058/bitcoin-cash-fork-scheduled-for-november-13/
Well, I just dropped 400$ spread across BTC, ETH and LTC on Coinbase. When you sell/purchase through them, with their massive turn around times, are you guaranteed the price quoted when you initiate the transaction?
Are you serious? What kind of social freedom is BCH offering?
FUD P&D
Totally new to crypto, and it seams that I jumped in at an exciting time. Now to figure out the best way to get into BCH...
hi guys, i am happy to meet likeminded people like you. I'am a ETH early adopter and BCH and ETH can both go into the future, hand in hand. I can see it
B.S.
"Im just sitting on the fence, and although I have a small amount in bitcoin and bitcoin cash, I really wish I could sell some btc for bcash so I can transfer and spend or even hodl. The only two reasons im struggling to do this is because of FOMO in regards to btc and because I currently have no job so its been a tight month.

Ill probably just put $20 aside every week and buy. Hell I get anxiety just looking at price movements so Im going in blind, yet small.

I just hope things go well for me and others. Poor people of Reddit, take it slow! I want all of us to gain, I just hope we arent wrong."
"Wow. I wish I knew about it then. I bought my first bitcoin (0.0066 bitcoin) when it was at 7300 (still waiting to get it from Coinbase) now it is at 6000. I have been trying to figure out how to buy Bitcoin Cash using usd but haven’t been able to get any yet. Really want to get BItcoin Cash. I think Bitcoin Cash is here to stay for long term. 

If anyone can help me out to buy Bitcoin Cash it will be really appreciated since I want to buy it now. "
I am so excited to see where this goes. As an amateur cryptocurrency enthusiast, I can't wait to see where this goes! 
I concur.
Is this the fucking vision you signed up for today was a perfect example of fuck ups like you with all the market manipulators gtfo with your bullshit!!! And don't fuck with BTC .. there is only one and always will be one BITCOIN!!!! 
Bitcoin Cash is close to having 33% of the value of Bitcoin. Is this the beginning of the flippening? Then after the flip can we just call it bitcoin again? And then we can call bitcoin core an altcoin. 
This is ridiculous. BCH won't overtake bitcoin. Never. 
Are we seeing the death of core Bitcoin this week? I think it might be. So interesting.
How the hell is Bitcoin as it is now financial freedom for everyone? It just has big fees and long transaction times which will be fixed in coming months i hope
Go BCH. It is our vision. I switched yesterday and completed the switch tonight. 
"Said the guy who contributed ZERO to bitcoin.
Bye bye! 
You won't be missed."
I seem to have missed it on the old days because that's what my entire life has been like

"bitcoincash.org has a list of exchanges you can use.

The easiest would be converting BTC on-the-fly to BCH through Shapeshift, Changelly or Evercoin, but BTC transaction fees pretty much skyrocketed in the last day or so.

Any rational or pure feeling?
Please dump, i will buy your cheap coin.
So funny to see so many troll accounts from rbitcoin posting here.... U can see they're afraid 
Btc had years to get adoption. Bch did in a few months what btc did in years. It will get used soon enough when people stop believing the propaganda machine which is Blockstream 
Yes. When you buy, you buy at the price when purchased.
"It is a classic pump and dump. 

Do you think the price went 2K + Euros and is now back down at 50% of that 12 hours later by accident. Clear pump and dump for profit. 

Not that I'm complaining, I managed to sell my BCH at 1950, sucks to be whoever bought them at that price and is down almost 50% in less than 12 hours. "
Many people will lose a lot. Markets are harsh. Things that were happening in 1990's in Russia... Read some horror stories. Prepare to fiat/crypto flip. People are gonna die in large numbers when supply chains in big cities will break and no one can do anything about it
"Google, there are so many posts in this subreddit, do a little bit of research, I'm sure you will find what you need ;-)"
Oh, boi. Read top posts here. One word: scaling
Bch is the attempted hijacking of Bitcoin through a concerted effort of a small group of miners that has deluded various people into believing on-chain scaling is a valid and sustainable scaling solution (which will simply further their centralized control of the mining economy). You'll notice the majority of Reddit accounts are not older than one year (most only a few months old) who are promoting bch. 
c'mon man.. you're just begging for a tip.. I'd give some if i was richhh like these guys tho lol
[deleted]
The more appropriate analogy would be people who consider blocksize increases to be a valid and sustainable scaling solution are akin to people thinking clean coal is the future.

Hey man, just fyi, we don't really like it when it's called bcash. Bcash is a different alt coin created by Blockstream to confuse new users. Better to use the ticket bch or Bitcoin Cash fully! 
Yes. Maybe ETC cos of rollback
I don't think so, BCH will overtake BTC, but bitcoin segwit will not die that fast.

A long time ago I was already sick of the blocksize debate and eventually thought why stop at bigger blocks? If I want the best network technically, sure bigger blocks will help, but eth has moved on so much further already with bigger improvements incoming that at best bitcoin can only copy a small subset of. All ether since then.
Ol muggins here still has no idea whats going on in the bitcoin world and has not bought a single coin of any currency. It's all so damn volatile I'm scared to put anything in!
I would say that's a misunderstanding of both Bitcoin Cash and the other tech you think is years ahead.
"If you really meant what you said, you probably would have sold neither and be holding both right now. You are literally being a hypocrite and listening to the noise (and the price). The honest and can't rebuttle answer is we don't actually know which side is correct. What everyone should have done was hold both and stop thinking we know everything. For all we know, both BCH and BTC still haven't found the answer to scale indefinitely. 

Also hav3 to remember this technology is extremely new so how could you believe a random noise in the internet to know the fix will work? IMO anyone that chose a side deserves to lose their money. Teach them the biggest lesson in trading and that is emotions stay out. To those that currently own the exact amount of BTC and BCH, they are living well and are laughing at all of the comotion."
I don't know the details of what's wrong with bitcoin but I can see the frustration and disappointment in your post
You can use btc or bch for everyday transactions. Are you going pay taxes on your everyday transactions? Wait for btc/bch to be labeled a currency first.
Monero is worth considering too.

how can people be so blind and follow bch? you see the people behind it??? well, if you believe CSW is satoshi then....

Take your private key(s) to a wallet/exchange that handles BCC and you will be assigned an equal amount of BCC as you had in BTC when the fork happened.

"If you think any of these currencies are here for the long term then it makes no sense to just buy them unless you actually have a use for them.

Currency is not a good investment. Currency doesn't do anything except facilitate the trade of things that are actually valuable. Currency only increases in value if there is insufficient supply of currency to meet the demand for currency.

What you appear to be interested in is a speculative asset (i.e. something you can by for X and then sell for 20x a short time later).

Speculative assets by definition make bad currencies because no one wants to spend them, everyone wants to sit on them and wait for them to go up in value. This is one of the reasons the entire world switched off the gold standard. It's also the reason nothing like bitcoin is ever going to become a widely adopted

The idea that deflationary currencies are somehow superior to inflationary currencies has never been proven. Almost every country in the world had a chance to keep hold of gold currency instead of switching to fiat, but none did. If deflation of the money supply actually conferred an advantage then surely at least one country in the world would have liked to retain that advantage.

But it doesn't. Money is only useful for allowing people to trade things of value, and a constantly shrinking supply of money (relative to total goods and services in the economy) does not allow people to trade more than a system that slowly increases the supply of money to match the value of goods and services in the economy. Shrinking the money supply discourages trade because the rarer money gets the more valuable it becomes so the greater the incentive is to not spend it."
0.05 bitcoin is $300, what those guys here are selling is bitcoin cash, a soon to be worthless altcoin.
Yes
BitcoinCASH is not BITCOIN. BCC is not BTC ,  A real BITCOIN you can sell for at least $6500 in the streets, who has a BCC to buy and sell? hahahhaha , keep up the farse

In years from now, people will say: at some time in 2017 there got a chain split and for some unknown reason the real bitcoin got rename to BCH... that's why we don't use the BTC ticker.
My transaction took 4 days to confirm.... With 7usd fee. Good luck !
Years behind? You mean the code was copy from Bitcoin Core because they had crap like replace by fee, pay for child, segwit, fee estimatation and other annoyances only to deal with their own issue of full blocksize? We don't need any of that and there is much much dev going on in Bitcoin Cash than think. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDF8bOEqXt4&feature=youtu.be&t=1h11m20s
That's what it is. They're even selling ltc and ether to prop up bch in an attempt to attack Bitcoin.
will there be Bitcoin buyouts?
"Yeah it's kinda cool .. I can't find the research right now but it's something that would help ""most"" coins with a large tx volume."
"Wow, I hadn't seen that Mike Hearn article.

If someone made those claims today Core supporters would assume it was just an opinion (one easily dismissed as 'from the other side'), but by being written 2 years ago and laying out how Core works and what's going to happen, we have 2 years of Core talking and doing just as Hearn explained they would, while also being contrary to what everyone at the time was led to believe."
Ok, don't work on the latency of blocks problem then since it's not that threatening to you. I wouldn't say it's a fear. It's just more of a question in computer science: what do I try to optimize in this system? To me the answer is latency in this case. Not bandwidth. In fact, higher bandwidth is acceptable here if it gives you less latency.
Don't worry, I think bch with their development team will be hard forking a lot. Just my opinion of course. Also, if you are pro segwit than you are 1% of rbtc
I won't be rekt no matter how low it goes from here.  And I won't have to pay more than a penny for a transaction. Ever.

"The lightning network, and other layer 2 solutions are fine, but they aren't going to exist for the next 5 years.

The blocksize is a tradeoff.  And right now, 8MB is well within safe limits for people to run their nodes.  When the negative effects of large blocks 'actually exist on the network', THEN we can start being more conservative.  

But right now there is a whole lot to be gained with larger blocks, and it only 'costs' the network a very small amount."
BCH supports up to 32MB blocks no hard fork, just a configuration file tweak.

So segwit is secure, why not activate it on this chain? Or you think segwit specifically is bad solution? I mean whatever solution you come up with in the future will likely require another HF right? It seems like you are agreeing that big blocks are only a temporary solution
Yea but big blockers bch people don't want segwit on their chain. You see the issue here? 
"Not avoiding. We’re simply doing what we can now; until other methods to scale become available and tested as secure."
Heard about Gavin’s work on Graphene?
"I feel this could include the other bullet-between-the-eyes response to ""bigger blocks cause centralization"": the more adopters the system can let in, the more entities arise with needs to run full nodes.

(often people making the ""bigger blocks cause centralization"" argument think fewer people can afford to run full nodes)"
But mining isn't decentralised enough.  How about a switch to multi-PoW?
Because most people are greedy and don't care about use. They simply just care about fast they can get profit from it in terms of USD. BTC will fail and BCH will be the new BTC.
"Well yes, bitcoin cash *is* bitcoin

but legacy bitcoin is no longer a viable means of exchange and without any fundamentals or utility it doesn't have a good outlook for being a store of value much longer"

Apologise,.
There are certainly areas that need to be optimized.  We've only scratched the surface.  We've started a five-year plan to remove the roadblocks to 1G blocks (3x Visa peak), so rather than worrying about the issues and getting paralyzed by fear, they are going to get fixed before they are needed.

"It should start from 0 and not duplicate the bitcoin chain. Is their project not strong enough on its own merit to start from 0? You'd make a lot more money mining from 0 than double-spending fiat coin. ICO are a good example of how quickly a coin can grow in value.

Hey buddy, you can troll all you want but your Bitcoin is nothing but a ponzi shitcoin. 'Bcash' is digital cash as originally designed by Satoshi nakamoto 
Bitcoin was supposed to be digital cash. What is it now? Satoshi did not create segwit
Or hold *and* spend to encourage merchant adoption. At the precise moment you spend it doesn't matter which currency you're using.
The audacity people like Luke have. They are destroying Bitcoin yet they attack Gavin at every chance, even though he is the second most important figure in Bitcoin after Satoshi. Do they have no respect?
"It's crashing back down. Soon, hash power will be 1% again.
You'll get rekt."
bitcoin core is a store of value, because no-one can take their money out
"So you want to let the totalitarian Chinese govt determine Bitcoin's capabilities. Sounds like a recipe for failure. Actually, I don't even have to guess what it sounds like — we can already see the results: failure.

Chinese miners are resourceful: they'll just cooperate with South Koreans and other Asian miners to escape the firewall, as they have already done by using Korean exchanges after China outlawed those, too. Only reason they haven't defeated the firewall yet is that don't yet have to. But they will, either because of inevitable block growth or due to inevitable repression from the Chinese govt.

This 'latency because China' thing is a particularly weak argument in Core's array of weak arguments for why fees have to be high when we all know that the only logical reason they have to keep the fees high is to preserve a future value proposition for their vapourware Lightning Network."
A tendency, eh? Well that honestly doesn't sound too threatening compared to an autocratic dev team intentionally keeping fees high and the network practically unusable in convenient alignment with their boss's plans to offer an alternative gateway and charge admission. You may be deathly afraid of that geographical 'tendency' which has always been endemic to the Internet. I try to keep my fears in perspective.
Very true. I do not envy them the crisis situations that force them into that position.
I'm feeling very good about Bitcoin Cash!
That would require a coordinated effort by a large number of them since the two networks still have significant hashrate. Assume that BCH is successful, and it stays immutable and they get more honest and less FUD with fake news. This printing of 18 million bitcoins from fiat can not be tolerated ever again.
So that's why they're selling BTC and buying BCH.  And 64% of the hash power.  All just one or two people.  Got it.
"No need to be redundant. ;)"
Yes. It's great to see real progress and innovation begin to be addressed again.
Because they make up 20% of the world population 
Not just the Chinese firewall although that is an issue. The basic problem is that miners have latency between them. If two miners are in a single region they will get the blocks propagated to each other faster, but if they are in different regions, it will be slower. So, there's a tendency to get miners in a single geographical region.
The best leaders are often the ones not looking to lead.
Hey bud, Bitcoin is not a shitcoin. Shitcoins such as dash, ripple, and bcash are generally discussed in r/cryptocurrency or their respective subreddits. Satoshi Nakamoto started the bitcoin project. Not the Bcash project. 
Because of the Chinese firewall, right? Why is it so important to cater to China? It looks like they are about to ban Bitcoin mining, anyway.
"You wrote: ""Core Devs are still pushing for a POW algo change""

To be honest, there were two lies in your post, and I am surprised you are not seeing this:

1. It was not the ""Core Devs"" but one member of the core devs who is known for his unconventional ideas that does not always create ideas the achieve majority agreement withing bitcoin core (at least I have never seen bitcoin core releasing a version based on tonal bitcoins).

2. LueJr wrote: ""PoW change conditions were met a long time ago, and are now overdue."" Calling this ""pushing for POW algo change"" is a stretch, because he jsut expressed an opinion in a tweet. Pushing for something"" means taking more concrete action.

So I am not surprised that your post earned bitcoin core's outrage. I hence still stand by the opinion that r/bitcoin do not censor or ban people for making pragmatically decent posts, at least your example does not even closely qualify as a counter-example."
I doubt more than a handful did. It just isn't the true bitcoiner's make up.
I hope you do!
"**Eternal September**

Eternal September or the September that never ended is Usenet slang for a period beginning in September 1993, the month that Internet service provider America Online began offering Usenet access to its many users, overwhelming the existing culture for online forums. The influx in Usenet users was also indirectly caused by the aggressive direct mailing campaign by AOL Chief Marketing Officer Jan Brandt in order to beat out CompuServe and Prodigy, which most notably involved distributing millions of floppy disks and CD-ROMs with free trials of AOL.

Before then, Usenet was largely restricted to colleges and universities. Every September, a large number of incoming freshmen would acquire access to Usenet for the first time, taking time to become accustomed to Usenet's standards of conduct and ""netiquette"". After a month or so, these new users would either learn to comply with the networks' social norms or tire of using the service.

Hey! Thanks for all the info!
"> I guess I'm not sure what this means.  I guess I'm dumb. :/

Not at all. : )

Cryptocurrencies are *weird*. They are not at all what you have been used to your entire life.

Good news is, you don't need to know much to use them safely. And you'll get used to it very quickly.

#In a Nutshell

A **wallet** is a collection of **addresses**. Each **address** is made up of a **public key** and a **private key**. 

**Public Key** - This is, as the name implies, the public part of an address that you share with other people. If I wanted you to send me some money I might say ""Send bitcoin to this address: [1BPr81BrFQZgHPwE1y5nZwBs7szduCYbGf](https://blockchain.info/address/1BPr81BrFQZgHPwE1y5nZwBs7szduCYbGf)"". That's just a random one I picked from the last block that was mined. As you can see it is *completely* public. But pseudo anonymous; you've no idea who owns that address.

So, an address is the equivalent of a bank account number, that someone can send money to. And like a bank account it needs a key that only the owner can use it. Normally that would be a user account and password. In bitcoin it is a...

**Private Key** - This is, as the name implies, private. Never share this with anyone. This is the key that allows you to *spend* from the public address. Whoever has this private key can spend from the corresponding address.

**Wallets** - Now, we say ""wallet"" but I prefer ""bank"". The reason being it actually is a bank. Literally. When you create a wallet you just created a bank that can create accounts and transfer money internationally. Again, literally, an international bank. The wallet/bank software auto creates a (huge) list of accounts, based on a ""seed phrase"". Each account/address is a public-private key pair, as I explained just above. 

Now, you can just use the one account/address for *all* your transactions ever, but to make bitcoin transactions even more hard to track wallets will automatically send transactions to new address/accounts. This all happens automatically.

I've gone off-topic, but you'll come across the above again and again, and it is pretty much ""how to use bitcoin"" for the average person. You don't need to know more to just use it.

**Wallets** contains **addresses**, and each address has a **public key** and a **private key**.

#Bitcoin Cash

Now, what the hell happened with the BCH fork, and how can you understand it? Let me try : )

The currency bitcoin runs on a protocol called Bitcoin. They are two things, but inseparable. The Bitcoin protocol includes a blockchain that contains *every transaction ever*, to every address, ever. It is now 9 years old and about 300GB in size. It *is* the bitcoin ledger.

When Bitcoin Cash (BCH) was made, ""forked"", it was copied from Bitcoin (BTC). Literally copied. Every transaction ever on the btc blockchain was copied and saved as the bch blockchain. As of August 1.

So say I have a spreadsheet that is keeping track of all the money I owe you, and you owe me, for whatever reason. If I make a copy of that spreadsheet all the IOUs are now on both copies. Exactly the same happened with the BCH fork.

So, if you had any addresses on the BTC chain with money in it (unspent transactions) those same addresses were copied to the BCH chain. And are still there.

If you have your **private keys** to those addresses, then you have the **private keys** to those addresses on the BCH chain.

Download [Electron](https://electroncash.org) which is a wallet specifically for the Bitcoin Cash blockchain. Generate a wallet using the seed phrase from your BTC wallet. Presto! You have Bitcoin Cash.

You can trade on exchanges like [www.hitbtc.com](http://hitbtc.com). They only require an email address so you can join and trade instantly (because you're not trading dollars or yen or euros, just crypto).

#Don't Send BTC to BCH

They are different blockchains. It's akin to you putting money in an envelope and posting to an email address. Different message systems.

#Fin
Now I've written all that I realised I should have asked you which wallet you are using. I assume you are using a wallet on your PC or phone??? If not you won't know your seed phrase, nor your private keys.

I highly recommend setting aside a small amount of money and playing with it. Send it to and from some addresses. Make a few wallets and practice. Learn how to backup. Learn how to make and use a paper wallet. It's all pretty interesting in itself. The tech is really cool, for example I sent my bitcoin to a painting for cold storage, hack that.

**P.S. How lucky are you!?** BCH has just had a *massive* pump and gone up, what 75% since I last replied you? (I call it a pump because 40% of the trades are out of one exchange in Korea. Not normal)"
I notice people give bitcoin in comments on these subs. When I figure out how to do that, I'll give you some!
So, what happens to the btc in my bread wallet when I import it into Electron?
Its Bitcoin, there are no rightful developers. Everyone is free to contribute and innovate and consensus / free market decides what sticks.
The shady things you speak of aren't really shady, they're just smear campaigns that you're inclined to eat right up. Trust me, if we knew what was going on behind the scenes in Bitcoin, you'd either be disillusioned to a traumatic degree, or just do some mental gymnastics and keep supporting the fee extortionist regime that has couped Bitcoin.
These are just bots. Check the articles here and it is the same bashing and style of writing from different accounts. Those miners are really campaigning hard against BTC, deinformation included

"Oversimplification. If it was that simple, the Federal Reserve would not exist, and we would still use the gold standard. It can take decades to hundreds of years for an unsustainable paradigm to collapse, such as the debt bubble. And let's face it, people are pretty stupid, so they'll believe whatever is posted in /r/bitcoin, because that's literally the extent of their critical thought: ""/r/bitcoin is like... the full name. I choose this one. Hey guys! New to crypto. What's up?"" - ""Bitcoin is king."" - ""Fuck yeaaaahhhhhh! Paying a meal's worth of monetary value for a transaction that hopefully won't take more than a couple of days, fuckkkkkk yeahhhhh.""

Crypto is full of shitkids who couldn't even tell you how a signature works. Keep that in mind. They hear about crypto, they buy whatever has claimed the Bitcoin name, they try some alts, and if they don't make money on it, they stick to Bitcoin. All they know is that they have Bitcoin. They know they have to copy/paste a series of characters to access, send and receive their BTC, but that's about it. Very, very few of them actually bother to learn how it works. And they keep hearing ""Bitcoin is king"" from the cult they unwittingly joined (lured by the series of letters: ""BITCOIN [nothing after]""), so the hoax keeps going.

So the first problem is that people will not necessarily support the best solution, they will support some image that has been planted in their heads by their peers and the people behind it.

The second problem is that both strategies rely on the support of a common resource, namely miners. Miners will come to BCH when the price is rising steadily yet fast enough to make it a more lucrative bet, which it won't be until the majority of people stop buying the inferior coin at higher prices. We depend on the ability of our fellow crypto investors to get a grasp of the situation and actually break free from cognitive dissonance.

That requires action on our part. It requires that we illuminate them.

So no, the Nash equilibrium does not apply in this situation. That's just lazy, wishful thinking."

There is a lot of fear-mongering going on out there. Everyone has their own economic motivation. Bitcoin Cash has been very unfairly demonized by the Bitcoin Core developers and fans. I wrote an overview about things earlier. [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7cbvel/can_someone_educate_me/dpopizn/) I don't give investment advice, but I will tell you I would not feel safe without owning at least equal numbers of each coin. The original person who the Bitcoin project was left to when Satoshi Nakamoto left, a guy by the name of Gavin Andresen, basically just said yesterday that Bitcoin Cash is more like the real Bitcoin.
It is the nature of social media nowadays I guess. Someone else posted something the other day that was like 8 or 9 layers deep or something. Was pretty funny.

"Honestly, Bitcoin is probably the most difficult technology to get into in the world. That's because the technology relies heavily on the actions and psychology of people. It is a highly dynamic system of a million moving parts.

The community debates are so difficult to follow because they a dispersed across hundreds of actions and hundreds and thousands of posts on many different social media sites.

The only reason I, and others on r/btc, have been able to keep up with the situation is spending way WAY too much time on social media following the situation, AND having a good understanding of how the network functions. The people on r/bitcoin (and r/btc) often are only seeing a few pieces of the puzzle and are intepreting the small amount of information they have and expecting it to explain the bigger picture. Often that information has been directly handed down to them by others and they have not been able to assess the situation properly themselves. What they don't see is the hundreds of other pieces that are required to put the full puzzle together. I actually don't think anyone has all the pieces. Some have more than others, and that's fine.

The reason why the debate has become so fierce though is that one side of the debate has been actively hiding many of the pieces of the puzzle from people and saying they don't exist. This is why people from our side are so angry. Not only that, but when we refused to be manipulated and abused for simply holding an opinion (one that literally everyone held in 2013), we were kicked out from our home at r/bitcoin. It really was a home to us. I had many what I would consider to be friends there. We were a great community. That is why this has all been so sad and destructive. None of this needed to happen."
You know that once you attach nationality to any bitcoin miners you've basically admitted that you are completely centralized.
"More efficient mining is great. The problem is when that advantage is limited to a single player, which is what Jihan is doing. This drives massive centralization, which is really bad for crypto.

Considering BTC only believes in a store of wealth while BCH believes in a currency it seems that BTC has no reason to come out on top. People only stayed with it for profit, not for practical use.

Because people on r/btc generally already know about the situation. People on twitter don't. So if it gets retweeted there, it has wider impact. It reaches more people who don't know about it.

It is actually a tactic in political science to make the side you want to win seem like the default. It changes how one words questions and such.

An example being the difference between opt-I'm and opt-out policies. People tend to stick with the default and do not opt. So if the default is in people will not opt out without good reason, and if the default is out then people will not opt in without good reason."

I didn't say make your friends buy BCH. I said tell them.
/u/tippr 0.001 bch
Been using Cex.io but I’ve heard lots of bad things about it....they verified me much faster than any other exchange at least and I've had no problems so far. Binance worked for me too. I’ve heard Kraken is the literal worst on everything, so only use it if you absolutely have to.
Trust no one. Currently it's three main teams: Bitcoin ABC, Bitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin XT
Mike Hearn was never a core developer.
In that order.
True for the world as well. Making people believe(!) in a certain history is beyond evil. It creates a curated and potentially limited future for all humankind.
We just have to keep spreading the word like you have just done, and other will stumble upon it and hopefully gets some insight into the truth about all of this. If more and more people do their own research and come to the same conclusion we won't be censored
"The problem is ignorance of end users. When the majority of end users only know that they're ""buying Bitcoin,"" and only know little bits and pieces of how it works, they are easily manipulated. In that state, the market's popular vote is controlled by the people with the biggest marketing budget and political power (though legally binding contracts and whatnot), not by the merits of the technology, or even the interests of the people behind it.

Bitcoin Core is a very profitable (for the large mining pools) scheme that intentionally extorts you into paying higher and higher fees to get your transaction processed. It cannot go one forever, because it's a bubble, and in no way does it serve you as a user. Bitcoin Core was a very well-organized heist, and it's time we take the power back from the men who duped the majority into calling Bitcoin ""Bitcoin Cash,"" thus locking in the illusionary image of being ""king.""

We need some sort of campaign that can't be silenced. Not by the activists (people seem to eat smear campaigns right up), but by us. lol

#RetakeBitcoin"
"> i'm so mad. What do we do next?

Anger can be a powerful driver. Try transforming your anger into something positive / productive. Like helping those still lulled in by the propaganda to wake up and see the light, for example.

"BCH is just a quick patch then, people are jumping around for such short term solutions.

If block size gets too big then BCH will become centralised due to computing power and the people claiming it is the REAL bitcoin will have no leg to stand on as it contradicts the white paper.

Very emotional and short sighted it seems"
Oh just wait until you learn how messed up the BCH developers are too, there are no good guys in the story the whole thing has degenerated into a multipolar shitshow.
"We do all the things we used to do on the original chain: we work on public awareness and merchant adoption, we build useful things. We don't just hodl but also spend, because we want a usable currency rather than just an investment instrument.

We don't need to ""get rid of"" anything: the original BTC will eventually die out because literally all it has going for it is the first mover advantage. We're not [delusional zealots](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7ccvl9/just_another_fork_to_destroy/?st=j9wvz7mp&sh=25078252), we're rational human beings. Yes, it sucks that we're having to start over due to the actions of the dishonest, but we're better than that and we should act like it."
And I'm mining nicehash like crazy so that I can get paid my 10mbtc and then wait for like days for the transaction to go through and finally trade it for bch xD
Welcome.  For those of us who are articulate and good in front of cameras, we need a few YouTube channels for new users.  All of the new channels that we see popping up created by new users this year with their 100k subscribers are unfortunately not  always informed.  So this results in millions of new users thinking that the current developers are the original developers.  Each of us can do our part to inform our friends and to help others answer their questions here.

You need to sell your btc for bch immediately! 
"I see a lot of ownership bias in r/bitcoin.

INCREASING THE BLOCKSIZE IS A SHORT TERM SOLUTION TO A LONG TERM PROBLEM!!! There has to be a better way. 
Wow! Why? You're too kind. Thank you.
Yeah well your about to get a lesson on coin pumping cause in about a few hours, you better get your parachute.  
"Bitcoin-anything is kind of a toxic asset due to the lack of consensus. I only fuck with it for short term gains. Wish I was privy to the BCH conspiracy a week ago when I migrated my gains away from the top of the bull trap.

Anyways, good luck with the soap opera. Just remember, Litecoin is better than Bitcoin Cash."
"Hmm, Then why has BTC been under constant attack?  If your altcoin is so perfect, why are you concerned with Bitcoin. Why is there shady thing after shady thing occurring with seemingly perfect timing? Why do your large gains come from odd combos of circumstances that come from ""outside noise"" to hurt BTC? 

Why does the mempool strangly become spammed with useless tiny transactions at the exact time Bitcoin Cash gets propped up with odd buy orders?  All during the same short time the mining profitability switches... For 1 day. Making a huge hubub about a technicality before your chain corrects itself a day later??

Who paid for google ads for a damn subreddit for Christ sakes?  So again, tell me who is the shady one?

If you were an altcoin and stopped this fcking madness, I'd prolly see the usefulness as an alt to Bitcoin.  But even this fucking post reeeeeeks of a scripted PowerPoint from a barely active account. LOL"
">Yesterday, I read up on the history of bitcoin and the scaling debate.

You should keep reading. No one understood very much about a complex issue by spending an afternoon reading about it."

Edit: by eliminated I mean murdered"
Do you have a link or links to what you read? Interested in reading something similar
So should I buy btc or bitcoin cash?
Until BCH has no scalability solution of its own it's merely the X8 better BTC, it still DOES NOT scale for a cash usage.

The best way would be to build BCH instead of attack BTC. Let the superior use case speak for itself.
It's a lot worse than you think. Keep reading the history.
"People such as Gavin Andresen, Mike Hearn and Jeff Garzik were the original 'Core' developers and they never agreed to what the current Core developers are doing.

It all really is a ruse of the highest level."
Also, people say that Bitcoin Cash has no independent devs, can someone please list and sticky that who are the devs

"> How do we make bitcoin cash succeed and get rid of the toxic fake bitcoin?

1) Sell our Bitcoins for Bitcoin Cash. All you can afford to lose (I'm not going all in, but I'm like 70:30 in Cash:Segwit).

2) Keeping the average user about what a shit coin Bitcoin is (both from a technological point of view and governance)

3) **getting the hashrate**. Segwit Coin is doomed without proper hashrate.

4) Spread the use of Bitcoin Cash. Till Steam and other shops accept Segwit coins we'll be the ""second coin"".

Mind you, for me Segwit coin and Cash can coexist, but we need to sustain BCH.

In the end I think this ""war"" might end up well for both communities or terrible for both."
There has been a lot of deceit, I've been following bitcoin for years and was largely unaware of all the BS that core and blockstream were up to. Not yet 100% convinced about bch yet, but I must thank the community for opening my eyes to the shenanigans going on with Core
And to top it off, if they just raised the blocksize to 2mb fees would still be high on the main chain.  High as in 50 cents or so.  Miners would be making plenty of money and there would still be room for other technologies.  There was NO compromise.  Now we can't even do a simple transaction without a $10 fee or waiting literally over a day.  
Damn didn't know about this censorship thing. Thanks for opening my eyes. I thought I knew it all guess I have tons of research to do 
"1.  Be prepared to be called a shill.
2.  Be prepared to be banned from r/bitcoin
3.  Pass the word

No need to get ""rid of this toxic fake bitcoin.""

Just use and spend your BCH, let BTC do its own thing.  A coin without utility will suffer in the end."
I recommend investigating more of the crypto space too if you have not.  Even Bitcoin Cash is not a sure thing.  The more information you have the safer you will be.

buy bch. get rich. tell your friends.
If you've done your research long enough, you'll know their main weapon is censorship. What's the best way to counter it? -Always spread all the information far and wide.
"As we've seen many times, historically, better marketing with a shittier product will always defeat a better product that lacks sufficient marketing, and they have the Bitcoin name. 

The average person knows very little of bitcoin and virtually nothing of alt-coins. When they learn of alt-coins, bitcoin cash is lumped in with them

Bitcoin cash will overtake bitcoin *only* if it implodes"
Why is 8mb big enough? Do you just keep upgrading the block size why not 1 GB block size? 
It really depends on what you are trying to achieve. BTC at least tripled after the fork so g the purpose of buying was speculation on the goal to sell for profit, BTC was not the 'wrong' coin.
"Dont trash talk /r/bitcoin memebers as it will just fgrow into more trash talking and we get no where. Instead be the mature one and inform people on what you think is right. They also have the right to their opinion. Dont hate, tolerate. At some point the coin that people find usefull will thrive. If its BCH or any other coin we cant say now. Crypto currencies is still quite new and we dont know the full potential of it.  
"
This reads so fake it's unreal...
"Congratulations on seeing the light. 

Now, we continue to fight. We vote with what power we have - miners by supporting the cash chain, users and investors by trading their BTC for Bitcoin Cash, driving the prices down and up, respectively.

If you are neither a miner or a large investor you can still help **majorly** by simply spreading the truth. I am not a large whale by any means but my contribution has still been significant thus far. **If you help even just one other person see the light, you have already done a great service for this community and for our species in general.** 

Understand that there are many, many people who are still stuck in the mindset that you were just a week ago. The clues that helped you see the light, use those clues to help them.

When I joined in the debate this sub had less than 30k followers and the opinion of scaling on chain seemed like a truly fringe opinion. Now we have snowballed to over 80K and massively growing everyday and people are waking up at an exponential rate.

Your reward for helping will be massive later in life, when BCH has reached mass adoption. The quicker we get there, the better, so it's full steam ahead for me :] "

F*cking A I'm right there with you. After the spike in bch last week I wound up here and started hearing about all the censorship on r/bitcoin. I am orders of magnitude pissed that I didn't find this place sooner and put my money into bch instead 
"It can work. The only reason bitcoin had a block size limit is because the network was very small when it was implemented, and Satoshi realized that the network could be attacked by creating very large blocks that the network was unable to handle at the time. It was meant to be a temporary patch. There is no reason to limit the block size to 1MB, unless you want to choke the network and force people to use your layer 2 solution (which means more money for you). This is precisely what Blockstream has done. Look at the mempool.

Layer 2 solutions would work fine on BCH, and will likely come at some point. But the immediate issue was the block size. "

And that is when they have Luke-jr as a major contributor who promotes slavery uses bitcoin as a platform to force his beliefs on others and believes in Sun going around Earth like he's some kind of medieval lumpen. It's just plain disgusting hypocrisy from the very beginning.

It became non-free as soon as blockstream silently invaded the whole development."
The OP says original bitcoin was going to solve scaling by block size increases alone, this can't work, are BCH supporters expecting to adopt layers? Because if so it's no different to BTC?
That works up to the point that someone controls the repos and keeps your upgrades out for personal reasons.  Conversely, controlling the repos only works up to the point where enough people actually using the system decide to run some other software.
They may be no rightful developers, but there are certainly wrong developers, and core is full of them.

Well, if you still hold BTC, good for you, as you may take their money later, but I urge you not to waste too much effort and energy on that.

The real work for those who believe Bitcoin (the true one) will change the world, is to make the average guy use it, is to ask the retail store where you make your shopping to accept it, to use the tippr bot (look it up), to spread the word. That is the kind of work that brought Bitcoin (both of them, and every other crypto) to what it is today, and that is what will keep it growing way past the 1MB limit banker's Bitcoin will never lift. Once that happen, who knows if old Bitcoin will still have its use? But until there, we have much work to do."

However, until more of humanity gets on board with the ""change our most basic paradigm in society from competition to cooperation"" thing, I don't mind using cryptocurrencies to increase my own freedom (by, hopefully, increasing my personal wealth from near nonexistent to just pathetic or so.) "

">It was a design decision to encourage acceptance of Bitcoin Cash by the community

No, the name is ""emergency difficulty adjustment"", it was meant to work only in the first few days and occasionally if there was a grand miner exodus from the coin.

The developers say so themselves. "
"Seems like opt-out would be more appropriate than opt-in. You should assume that most users *don't* know what they are doing. 

Not sure how it gives a 'false sense' of security. You need to understand it, but I've personally been protected by it and it has also made attempts to breach other systems difficult (though nothing is impossible) to the point that it wasn't worth attempting to breach. "
People are leaving the Titanic
"Very good. By ""no 2FA"" I meant it was not forced upon their users but rather opt-in."
 They could also mine BTC and then sell it for BCH.  That way they can actually obtain more BCH and give it even more support. 
Good luck with that. Bitcoin is what people want it to be. It was PROPOSED as digital cash system. Right now it is more like digital gold. One day it might be cash too but for now its gold. And thats ok. Bitcoin will be whatever people want it to be. But not you. The majority. After schnorr, LN and all the other awesomeness Bitcoin will be suitable for mocro transactions again. Things take time. People do not take Bitcoin's name.
eventually, when all the coins are mined, you'll need the EDA to adjust the difficulty to keep costs down = more transactions (full blocks) with smaller fees per transaction but the same overall fees paid to miners.
"Probably.  But that doesn't mean it won't happen, it happened this time.  In fact, on a long enough time scale it's effectively guaranteed to happen.

And luckily, the genius of Bitcoin is that it is unstoppable precisely because it has fallback mechanisms to release built up pressure whenever something is very wrong."
"Because if the iteration is going to win, it has to prove that it's better and necessary on its own merits.  You can't handicap the original to ensure an iteration, because iterating just for the sake of iteration is a huge negative (iteration change has a LOT of costs).

But in the case of necessity, it's ultimately a good thing.  But it does have to be necessary. So whatever could replace Bitcoin Cash has to be worth replacing it.  And Bitcoin Cash is worth replacing Bitcoin partly because of the EDA."
Difficulty's gonna go up 400% in about 22 hours, the price needs to be four times higher than it is now for the ratio to hold where it is now. BTC price dropping will also help actually. This is a huge thing though. BCH can adjust much faster so that transactions never get too slow and prices never get too unstable. BTC takes weeks to adjust.

A small limitation you forgot to mention is that this applies to POW crypto, not all.
if bitcoin cash is an iteration, why prevent an iteration?
Fuck man. Good analogy.
If there are future forks resulting in significant community splits, it's probably because something is very wrong.

It is just a pump from korea. It will come back down after the difficulty fork kicks in on November 13. It is the same pump as 3 months ago. 50% of the volume comes from Korea. That is not an organic growth. I got on bch the train for the second time at 900 and I sold today at 1300. It might go up a bit, but it will go down eventually when btc is equal or more profitable. 
Do you seriously believe 50% has permanently  switched to mine that? 1 day and miners will come back to Bitcoin.
Not as long as they hold $7billion in bitcoin we wont.. The tactic employed by the NSA seems like it would fall apart in the fairly likely scenario that SN is actually a group of people

"Disclaimer: I may be biased. I side with Bitcoin Cash.

First, there is intent: members of the Bitcoin Core team have indicated that they plan to take it in a ""digital gold"" direction as opposed to cash. Proponents of this vision make light of the idea of using cryptocurrency to, say, buy coffee. This is expressly against the intended design of Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer digital currency. The mission of Bitcoin Cash is to correct course back to being a digital currency.

In terms of technology, the following is relevant:

- BTC currently has very high network congestion, and thus high transaction fees. A backlog is forming. This is due to an arbitrary 1MB block size limit, which is literally impeding on-chain scaling (as in, scaling Bitcoin itself by processing more transactions per block). The purported rationale for keeping the 1MB limit varies, but the gist of it is that larger blocks are supposedly harder for users to store (as any user running a full node needs to keep an entire copy of the blockchain), and/or they are less secure (although no evidence or even hypothesis has been offered to show this), and/or the contention that we should use an external layer to scale Bitcoin instead of allowing Bitcoin itself to grow. The latter point is the most significant one, and has been stated publicly: that scaling Bitcoin should be done via external solutions. Some Core members have also said that high transaction fees are actually desirable.

tl;dr: Pro-BTC people believe Bitcoin shouldn't grow enough to support a cash-like volume of transactions, and that high fees are OK, maybe even desirable in order to encourage a shift to 3rd parties / sidechains, where the actual scaling should happen. This is more similar to gold, because gold is a security and not cash (you can't buy coffee with gold), and so you tend to access it via gatekeepers, and the transactions you would make would be closer to a wire transfer (e.g. simple transfer, or investment) than a transfer to buy coffee. You could supposedly still buy coffee using Bitcoin only as a backend, but you'd be doing this in the Lightning Network, which is unreleased (and always 18 months away), and has unknown characteristics (you may find yourself dealing directly with a company, and being subject to their own policies, rather than having the assurances of blockchain technology).


- BTC has implemented Segregated Witness (SegWit), which is a controversial update, to say the least. SegWit is very complicated, so I won't quite do it justice here, but essentially it's a fix for transaction malleability. Malleability must be fixed in order to do off-chain scaling. SegWit is Core's solution for this. It also uses a very convoluted and complicated ""block weight"" system for calculating block size, thus resulting in larger blocks in certain relatively uncommon situations, and so Core sometimes claims it's also a scaling solution. SegWit introduces complexity and several security vulnerabilities. More importantly, it goes against the idea that Bitcoin can be viewed as a chain of digital signatures (https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6vmvfp/we_define_an_electronic_coin_as_a_chain_of/). The entire thing is controversial, but Bitcoin Cash proponents deem it unnecessary. Redirecting the growth of Bitcoin to external solutions turns Bitcoin into more of a long-term value store (i.e. similar to gold) rather than a high liquidity asset (cash).


- BTC has RBF (replace by fee). This means that if you send a BTC transaction and it gets stuck for a long time, you can override it by re-issuing the transaction with a higher fee (thus canceling the original stuck transaction). It's thus more likely to go through. A consequence of this is that a merchant can not rely on unconfirmed transactions, since they can be canceled. Bitcoin Cash removes RBF, and so even unmined/unconfirmed transactions may be accepted by merchants on a provisional basis (think of ordering a coffee, and not having to wait until the transaction gets mined).


- Conveniently, many of the BTC developers are employed by a company (Blockstream) that sells sidechain solutions. What a coincidence.


- Core employs blatant censorship on r/Bitcoin and other forums. They also engage in malicious behavior, such as BTC supporters registering r/bcash and trying to claim that Bitcoin Cash is called ""Bcash"" and is just an altcoin unrelated to Bitcoin.


In light of the above, Bitcoin Cash is very simple to understand:

- Mission = decentralized digital cash, not digital gold
- 8MB block size limit in order to allow a much higher rate of transactions to be processed (= lower fees and your transaction doesn't get stuck), so the actual blockchain can scale up (whereas BTC's current development team literally does not want Bitcoin itself to support more growth)
- No SegWit
- No RBF


Bitcoin Cash negatives: it has a fragile difficulty adjustment system, which has caused some pretty harsh swings in the block mining rate (periods with very few blocks mined, followed by periods of very fast mining). This will be fixed in the next few days, via hard fork. That's the only negative I can think of."

"Current estimate for BCH difficulty retarget is Nov 13th, 13:51 UTC

New BCH difficulty algo is live from the first block after Nov 13th, 19:00 UTC"
Yes, the difficulty of BCH won't oscillate dramatically, but which chain is more profitable will. Precisely because BCH difficulty will always be oscillating close to the ideal.

"> is much lower than that of BTC no?

Yes. Grows with hashrate"
Yeah, I don't think that's how it works. Network fees are still pretty minimal. If it's 3x more profitable to mine BTC they're going to mijne BTC. That being said, the price of BCH is not rising because of the miners.
doesn’t the eda enable a small group to keep the current chain alive and survive large hash power attacks? that was the whole point of the eda to begin with.
I hope both stay alive....But then again im invested in both so...
Thanks!

^ Found the girl!
Do you know when this update will happen?
"That is unlikely unless BTC's difficulty oscillates as well, which doesn't happen. Since BTC's difficulty rarely changes, the BCH difficulty algorithm is essentially in the driver's seat. If the BCH price were to fluctuate wildly for some other reason, then there might be a lot of quick switching temporarily (that's true regardless of which DAA is in place), but with the new DAA in place, I doubt it could last very long.

The next few days will be extremely interesting. You can tell things are getting intense when you end up regretting just going to sleep!"
Dorian Nakamoto
I see. But why would they wish to do so if the DAA is more consistently profitable? My point wasn't that they *can't* keep the unupdated chain alive — they can. I just don't think it will serve their best interests.
Ok. 7.06 PM GMT on Nov 13. Approx 41.5 hours from now
"Yes this is correct. I am not saying that 2FA is worthless :D I am saying that for some people it is an overkill to demand. My point is that people should be able to say: ""I know what I am doing, I know the risks, now please let me opt out from 2FA in this particular case."" Also I'm not a big fan of Google, so I don't want to use their particular solution for 2FA. Now if they used Byteball wallet for 2FA it would be another story ;)"
2FA is good when your computer is compromised, indeed. However, in my case, if my computer should ever be compromised I'd be in much bigger trouble than having any of my exchange accounts hacked :D
You are correct. Wow does time fly.
You sicken me.
Might have already happened, not sure for bitcoin.com wallet. I use Electron Cash, and they just released a version supporting the fork.
I think we have learned that consensus is not always easy to reach. Especially if money can be made from disruption. 
Just a question does wallets have to upgrade to be able to function with the DAA fix?
You certainly don't mine, if you did you would know the halving is every 4 years, you would also know  that current rate with the EDA brings Satoshi's plan of the year 2140 down to roughly 2060. 
Nope, its the backend so to speak that gets updated. Because its done with consensus and no replay protection you dont need to update your wallet
I do mine, troll. 2 years may be too fast. It depends on blocks not time anyway. Every 210,000. I doubt your schedule. Because if the EDA is fixed on Nov 13 then it won't have increased the schedule significantly. It just means they've reached the next halvening 1 or 2 years quicker.
We miners like the few extra coins but realise it's only great for the short term profits. In reality we know it needs to be sorted properly or we'll mine all the remaining bitcoins too quickly and ruin the distribution schedule. The way Bitcoin works is that all the coins are mined over 100 years. As the reward halves every 2 years it should get harder and harder to mine. Therefore causing deflation on the coin rather than inflation. Eventually in 100 years when all the coins have been mined there'll be 10 billion users all paying 1 cent per transaction and that will be plenty reward for miners to keep the network running.
"Not happening. Because there are lots of people deeply invested in btc. Thats Bitcoin for them. They will always call it Bitcoin. Even if Bitcoin Cash manages to steal the ticker the price is still lower. 6k Bitcoin vs 1k ""Bitcoin"". People are not dumb."
I don't consider myself a hacker, but I have stolen passwords/etc in the past. I agree that opt-out is an important feature for users that don't have proper smartphone-like systems. And I believe that not using untrusted nodes is important as well. As long as you generate unique passwords for every site, that enables some security. Brute forcing is a last resort and shouldn't be relied on from an attack method. Unfortunately though, targeted attacks exist. You're 'trusted' nodes can easily be compromised in some fashion, [hardware solutions](https://www.keelog.com/hardware_keyboard_logger.html) exist which can be soldered directly into whatever brand keyboard you use, including video loggers. And thats before we discuss software/rootkit/etc logging.  The one thing I've seen stop these specific attacks are methods similar to 2FA. 
It is [5 hours later](https://www.bitcoinabc.org/november). The time originally mentioned in the announcement did not match the timestamp.
"What's I the block height for the hardfork?

I wouldn't be surprised if the miners redirected hash-power to BTC for those ~4 hours to help BTC users to exit and not let EDA to trigger before the DA-algo upgrade.

EDIT: Oh, I see it's not a block height but time time flag. Makes sense."
"https://fork.lol/pow/retarget is now predicting the BCH difficulty retarget will occur Nov 12th, 14:08. It's moving up, probably due to all the hashrate that is moving over to the BCH chain.

Of course, by then it may *still* be more profitable to mine BCH, even with a 400% increase in difficulty. BCH's difficulty is currently 10% that of BTC's, so if the price rises to 0.4 BTC before the difficulty retarget, it will remain more profitable to mine BCH all the way to the hard-fork."
Does  SPV wallets Need an upgrade? For example bitcoin.com s wallet.
Those two variables are in tension with each other, and oscillate in sync. Calming one should calm the other. If the BCH difficulty changes more gradually, then so do miner incentives to switch.
The EDA allows a chain to stay alive when it is largely abandoned by miners and ends up with a very low hashrate, causing the blocks to slow to a crawl, and that was only a danger for Bitcoin Cash in the early days. Anyway, the new DAA has that property, too.
"So you're suggesting all miners sell immediately, instead of holding in expectation of future rises in price?   

Are you claiming that altruistic mining doesn't happen? "
"Hard Forking is a normal, common action and almost never results in two coins. This recent trend of bitcoin forking multiple coins has spread FUD around Hard-Forking. 

Updates to the code often requires a hard fork to implement, and usually everybody agrees on the code updates.

Concerning BCH/BTC, some developers disagreed with the SegWit update (rightfully so) and used the hard fork to keep a coin alive that followed Satoshi's vision."
Why would anyone want BTC to fail or BCH to fail? Why is it a competition? Doesn't it benefit everybody if both coins go to the moon? Hodlers of BTC pre-fork are hodlers  of BCH and BTC post fork. If both coin succeed then everyone wins.
"November 13th, 2:06 PM GMT.
Which is approx 37 hours from now.

"
"Anyone know why 80% of BCH purchases are coming from one no-fee Korean exchange? ;)"
"okey opt-out would also work :D I fully understand that for the bulk of users it could be a good thing, for people who put their password the same as username for example :D I guess the major beef that I have with enforced 2FA is that I am not a smartphone user nor do I intend to ever become one, so it complicates things for me more than there is potential benefit. 2FA is good if you might log in from untrusted computers, it's never the case with me because I use generated passwords that look like this:
AYzJC9PUp4rnRbJv2Xqh5ezQC9fWYhj0

This means that I am unable to log in from untrusted computers to begin with, even if I wanted to, even at gunpoint. And the master password that I have contains 12 random words from various languages. Easy to remember, hard to brute force."
what if karljt is the majority? (MIND=BLOWN) even if btc manages to keep the ticker, people will still call bch bitcoin. 
bitcoin was designed to kill forks to preserve the property of scarcity.  also, EDA is comparable to running a printing press.
"Yes. But I don't think the the price would need to be four times higher than it is now, because I assume this will be the last 400% spike.

The idea behind the new DAA is to adjust much faster to changes in hashrate and thus does not allow such spiking increases in difficulty after two days of ""rush hours"".

"

Spying on everyones data is crazy powerfull
I believe that SPV wallets will need an update yes.
"Not if miners are switching automatically. Which is the most profitable chain might change at every new BCH block.

Well. Let's wait and see "
my point is that if the current chain is abandoned, the eda would allow a very small group to keep mining it and keep it alive, since it satisfies the “largely abandoned” criteria you just mentioned
No. I'm saying if a miners objective is to hold BCH, when BTC is more profitable to mine, they can get more BCH by mining BTC and selling it for BCH than staying and mining BCH.
Oh please, come on people. Majority hash rate is achieved due to EDA. Please get real. 
Miner love the EDA coin because they can miner dozens of blocks per hour rather than only 6.
Thing is, the FUD has been totally unwarranted. The hardforks have brought only more freedom for more market participants to get what they want, as well as to give a clear signal to the miners. Total value stays the same or grows, and miners get a clear picture of what direction to go, for the very first time. Forking is indispensable to Bitcoin's governance model.
I've seen this before... Fascinating read. Technology is crazy powerful.
"It's a meme from the forums when somebody meant to post ""This is it, gentlemen"" and screwed up."
My point was that they'd rather be earning BCH for it's longterm potential, since they're not selling right away and don't wish to pay the network fees and exchange fees that are required to transact BTC in order to get BCH.

BCH is the future. Ver og co destroyed BTC
~15 hours until difficulty increase.
Glad revised EDA is being released, in a couple days. 
the price has reach a point where its profitable regardless
i believe this is due soon.
the 3h rate is higher for bch.
What about the emergency difficulty though? Has that been sorted out yet?
Well, after the update, profitability won't get much different from one chain to the other (since difficulty in BCH will adjust faster), but necessarily there will always be one chain more profitable than the other at each given moment. And I suspect the shifting of which is more profitable now will happen much more frequently. I wonder if miners are already changing chains automatically. If that's the case, hash rate oscillations might get even wilder.
are there going to be new coins issued like in other forks?
I wouldn't discount any thought of strategic plays here.  There is some 4d chess being played here while i'm playing checkers...
Shifting equilibrium. Nash theorem
[deleted]
is this true? interesting.
"People screaming ""spam"" when in reality it's a wealth transfer"
This isn't accurate. The inflation difference between BTC and BCH is only 0.015%. One could argue the difference is compensation for the risk miners took while mining at a loss for substantial parts of the last 3 months.
When the cumulative proof of work on Bitcoin cash exceeds the legacy chain that's when I'll really start celebrating.
Use bitinfocharts.com
The normal DAA should do an adjustment at block height 504,000. That is only 250 blocks away, which won't be long at the current rate. Hopefully it stabilizes things a little. I haven't done the math, but I am assuming it will slow things down quite a bit. 
Manipulation at it's finest. This is a waist of time. Wake up.
depends when you got it I suppose, a smartdevice wallet like coinomi and electron cash and shapeshift though
In my opinion some BTC supporters spread a lot of misinformation and negativity, making it harder for better technology to be accepted. So I just want that to stop. 
Yes, only the ones bold enough to engage in fork arbitrage really have a stake in the outcome. Note how Bitcoin=BCH+BTC remains virtually unchanged at $7650. Hodlers unaffected. Arbitrageurs are killing each other in the trenches, leading to the more prescient ones coming out with more power and the less prescient ones less. Basically **the average hodler intelligence in Bitcoin (weighted by the value of their holdings) is increasing by leaps and bounds today**, while hodlers just yawn. The end result should be happy hodlers as the overall price rises to reflect this dramatic increase in average intelligence.

https://wex.nz/
Obviously an attack on Michael Marquardt, Gregory Maxwell and Adam Back. Oh, I mean bitcoin.
no, bitcoin cash has replay protection enabled (which segwit2x did not have).
"The 1MB vulnerability as a single point of failure was presented many times most notably explored when the antblead vulnerability was explored.

the thought exsperiment was simple:

> what would happen to the transaction rate if 70% of miners stopped mining and there was a 1MB limit -vs- what would happen to the transaction limit if 70% of the miners stopped mining and there was an 8MB transaction limit.

The opportunity to fix this 1MB vulnerability fell on ignorant ears, and now it will be exploited. "
"I know that segregated witness never got much miner support until lied about the condistions of it's activation.

SO logicall about 80% of the hashpower might quickly leave the legacy chain and move to bitcoin"
Why does market value of BCH follow the hash power so closely? 
"The EDA basically allowed the miners get way richer, along with the already crypto rich. 

Just great. "
Only for the next 19 hours and miners may mine with short-term loss
fork.lol is incorrect, it cannot rise 400%. The max single adjustment is 4x: -75% to +300%.
Stop making sense.
actually, the new DAA is good.  Better than every 2000 blocks.  Not much reason for btc not to use it too.
What's EDA?
The mining reward and fees are a DROP IN THE BUCKET when compared to overall volume.
Unfortunately it's only so profitable because of EDA, let's hope the fix will work 
Hmm, I didn't know about the difficulty adjustment, and I'm holding some BCH. Do you think the price is going to drop because of it, or do you think investors even know about the impending difficulty adjustment?
What's DAA?
so should i sell (at least half) of my BTC and buy BCH? these developments are so exciting, i can’t wait to see what happens over the next few years!
A Bitcoin Cash mistake that resulted in periodically subsidizing miners with extra unplanned inflation. 
https://fork.lol
What makes BTC analogous to gold and BCH analogous to cash in this case?
Won't DAA also lower miner profitability and therefore decrease hashrate.
where are you seeing this?
yep, its weird, more than once with bitcoin I have thought of hari seldon and how bitcoin seems to go through a seldon crisis every once in a while. its really weird, actually
So people celebrate flawed difficulty adjustment algorithms that lead to inflation now? Sounds like your typical bcash user.
Bitcoin not having the drama of a crypto dictator or group of publicly visible fallible people has been very healthy for it.  Look at all of these altcoins with embarassing drama because developers can't help but get political or become divas over them.

"> Use bitinfocharts.com

Why this one is any more reliable? "
Yes, a few pools already do change chains automatically. But since Bitcoin Cash's new DAA will be based on a 144-block (one day) rolling average, it should be able to absorb and smooth out such oscillations. It's far from overreactive. It looks like a well-engineered solution, at least in theory.
Only if both the old and new 'tines' of the fork survive, but for that to happen, there would have to be a significant number of miners who refuse the upgrade. Why would miners refuse an upgrade that will make mining consistently profitable, rather than a boom-and-bust affair? It seems unlikely. I think the fork will go pretty smoothly and there will be no accidental 'new coins'.

"90% of the people I️ know who happened on bitcoin in the last 12 months (which is a huge % of the current ecosystem) are completely lost and don’t know what to think. Because the thought control and censorship over there has them convinced BCH is the brainchild of Demon Man, Roger Ver.  

They have no idea how we got to this place. And they’re not allowed to learn. They weren’t there for years and years, as people politely begged Core to do something, and got laughed at, or ignored. I sat here and watched it day after day. Slowly getting more and more angry. Knowing this day would come.

The information control has done a ton of damage.  I am in a few groups with tons of stock investors that switched to crypto, and they all just believe what they’re told from over there. They mock BCH, because they think that’s the narrative.  They have no awareness of how this thing actually played out over the last seven years. 

That’s why I wrote my [tweet](https://twitter.com/bittburger/status/929419040816209920). The rewriting of history that has happened has done incredible damage.  "

In future, those coins traced back to Kikvadze can rightly be called 'fool's gold' :-)

I'm one of those bigger fools who bought BCH at $800... but turns out even that is a lesser fool than George, lol.
That’s how trading goes though, I’m sure he made more profits trading other coins than he would have waiting on bitcoin

I held on.
Don't feel bad for George. He's probably lying, as usual, and is hoarding his Bitcoin Cash, while tweeting this nonsense to show his fellow cult members that he's still one of them.
"yea.. i usually get frustrated by them, but this time it's sad... making up theoretical and political reasons why this isn't happening.. I wish they'd say ""well after EDA patch, BCH might fall under 1.0x profitability again"" at least then they'd be hanging onto a rational hope... 

I get the feeling that many of them don't even understand what happens when you lose 50%+ mining power, and they legitimately think the mempool is just being spammed."

It's not artificial. Why do you think that? Most people start to see through the Blockstream lies and start dumping their cripplecoin for the real Bitcoin. Last week I sold my whole 30btc for bch, is this also part of the artificial pump?
Pump and dump schemes seem to be the best time for exchanges. It is stupid economic decision to not support it.
"If you're really trying to get BCH as fast as possible, one option is to go on Coinbase, buy $250 of ETH (or other currency), send that ETH to your wallet on an exchange that supports BCH (like QuadrigaCX or Shapeshift), sell your ETH, and buy BCH.

Sad thing is Coinbase takes a 5% cut whereas QuadrigaCX has lower fees:

Oh yeah, I have some respect for Ethereum, and the precise qualities that made it so interesting for app-building, in my opinion makes it unsuitable for a world-changing currency. Since the two project missions (Bitcoin and Ethereum) are mostly unrelated, I don't think we should pay too much attention to whether we overtake them or not. 
My thoughts exactly. The World Wide Web was born out of cooperation, not maximalism. There's no reason that the Ethereum community and Bitcoin Cash community *can't* collaborate and every reason to do so.

You think Wall Street is the whole world.  That is passe thinking.  The volume is primarily coming out of Korea which is a proxy for all of Asia especially China.   If Wall Street wants to pile their money into BTC they will be the eventual losers.  The rest of the world has been looking for an opportunity to break away from the petroldollar for decades.  They can do that now with Bitcoin Cash.
I think BTC can only survive this short term hashpower battle if it hardforks the lift the blocksize cap. And if that comes from Core it would ruin their whole narrative. Possible that 2x will decide it really was a good idea to fork. The market signal couldn't be any clearer.
"> I think that's unlikely as I don't see this BCH rally stretching that far, I think we'd be lucky to break much more than $2000 short-term, 

Momentum is a crazy thing. With the way things are going I wouldn't be surprised if bitcoin and bitcoin cash hit parity at around $3,500 in the next week. In that case I think Bitcoin Cash COULD takeover the number one spot and hold on to it. "
1.5 hours after your comment and we're at $2050. I wonder where it will be in the morning...
Throw all the FUD you can think of, something will eventually stick.
What do you mean by this? I’m on the fence and trying to get all the info I can. 
Yes that’s correct, according to the last estimate based on the amount of Truffle downloads it was actually over 50k but though I would err on the side of caution when repeating that.
People are buried with work in smart contracts' programming, Billions of dollars in so many markets it will affect. Kudos to talented people, but Ethereum isn't sound money
"As a (very minor) dev for the BCH side of things (and I wasn't even to keen on BCH for a long time as many of you remember), I hope and think a lot of focus will be on keeping and making the chain simple.

Do crazy DB stuff, crazy efficient network transmission protocols etc.?

Sure thing.

But the validation part, that what defines the chain, should mostly (except blocksize of course) stay as it is IMO. Unless a major feature *warrants* a change.

No thanks to SegShit force feeding or similar.
"
Artificial? Delusion much? 160k+ txs on dying chain with insane fees. Do u think those people are gonna buy a cup of coffee made of gold?
Aren't you ashamed to write such a bullshit?
"> Can you explain In what ways you think BCH is more popular than ETH?

It's Bitcoin. End of story. I actually invested in ETH in early 2016 (price around $10) and just holding it, so I'm not crapping on it.

But as one comparison to bitcoin payments, ETH can only do one type of transaction. A to B. There's no (A, B, C --> D) or (A --> B, C, D) type of transactions. That is a huge weakness IMO.

> ETH had 40k+ developers

ETH has ""40,000 developers"" just like Core has ""100's of developers"".

If I once corrected a spelling error in commented out bitcoin code, I'm a Core developer."
40k+ developers?!
"Well, I don't think so. It's possible that cleaner money (than ETH itself) could be run on top of Ethereum but it will still be subject to the Ethereum dictatorial incentive model.  

There is always good money, there is always bad money, and good money always wins in the end.  To some extent this is a clash of philosophy/culture and we're not going to settle it here.  Thanks for interesting discussion."
I would be happy with either scenario also. As long as the Blockstream fuckers get what they created... their own doom... I'm happy. 
I think people put way too much stock in the market cap cock measuring. Face it, all crypto is right now is emotional speculation. Until there's an actual scaled blockchain with real world utility at scale none of this stuff matters. It's all just manipulation, a chain of pump and dumps. Sure BCH is nice, currently able to handle more transactions than BTC, but not nearly enough to handle mainstream adoption, they need a multi-faceted scaling roadmap to reach that not just big blocks, I haven't seen a consensus roadmap on how that's going to be accomplished. But yet, billions pouring in as I type this. You can try to ride the hype waves as they pump from ETH, to BTC , to BCH, to ETC, and hope you time out your jumps and don't get caught in the riptide when the manipulators move, or you can place fundamental bets on who's going to get to that scaled implementation first and best, but the 2017 market cap really only matters for whales and plankton.  
While this is true, I wouldn't consider Ethereum a distraction. The whole premise of Ethereum is very interesting and I don't see a reason why it couldn't co-exist with Bitcoin Cash. They're not really competing, but yeah, going to #1 is the goal here, and we're well on our way to get there. 
"150K last I checked.

The dump is real right now. I had a 330 entry point at October 25 so I'm still good but I should have exchanged for ETH last night to lock in profits. Might fall back to 800 range or lower... Or could go up again. But that was an epic pump the last few days, especially last night. Good times.

From what I've read miners will be switching back to BTC on Monday. "
A market so liquid and juicy, ripe for volatility, playing ping pong on the roller coaster has been an amazing ride.
Not to mention I recieved my first reddit gold tonight for elucidating upon this fiasco on r/Bitcoin
Win at what? They do different things?
True. You can't buy it for that.
See where apple is now in the personal computer space. They were almost bankrupt before Jobs came back and saved them with the iPhone. Honestly I do not think that this is what Vitalik was referring to, I think he really means it. He has been defending BCH against BTC attacks on twitter for a long time.

Blockstream postponed growth of Bitcoin. No more!
Well it would be for ABC or BU or one of the other implementations. It could have been some arcane thing Core already changed in their codebase.
absolutely
The executives are likely in the same shock as people from the street with a couple of coins. Nobody expected it so fast (maybe except silent Coinbase)
Well ok but Litecoin is a clone, Bitcoin Cash is the design that was cloned.  Bitcoin Cash sits on a longer chain than Litecoin and has over 10X the market cap at the time of this comment.  Bitcoin Cash also isn't stuck with SegWit.  It's irresponsible to call it a ponzi and just reveals desperation. Come on, there is still room for Litecoin.
"> Now I think it's 70 % likely that Bitcoin Cash will take the number one market cap spot within a few days and then keep that spot for the foreseeable future.

I think that's unlikely as I don't see this BCH rally stretching that far, I think we'd be lucky to break much more than $2000 short-term, but then will begin a war of attrition that could last a year, but I think BCH will prove the winner there. We'll know by the 2020 halvening who has won. 

The key will be if BCH can differentiate itself, VISIBLY, before Wall St piles in with their money. If we can get on their radar when they are doing their due diligence, then the obvious value proposition of BCH over BTC will make a lot of them think twice, and smart money will begin pouring into BCH rather than BTC.

In fact, I expect this could make the difference for BCH. This fight will ultimately be judged by price differential.

The BTC partisans can be delusional about which coin is the 'real bitcoin' right up to the point where miners abandon them, their transactions don't complete anymore, and the real kicker will be BCH price surpassing BTC.

At the end of the day, bitcoin is math, not social science, and propaganda can only get you so far. The hard facts are hard fucking facts, and the facts say that BCH is far supeior *right fucking now* to BTC, and that this will always be the case because Core is dedicated to a development path completely contrary to BCH and has every intention of stubbornly never changing direction.

Bright days ahead."

"Yes and no. While all of that is true. Climbing to #2 is a big milestone that still holds incredible value in itself. How many of the more serious cryptos have even gotten to this point? 

Still, eyes ahead, the big target is still infront of us! "
That's why I want BTC to lose (other than the lack of progress) is because core and all there sycophant followers seem to be the ones who think BTC is everything and ETH should die.
"Lots of people thought the world was flat.  I personally think Roger is a great guy.

I do agree with your point about branding, I just think your blame is misplaced. Any brand damage is entirely the fault of Blockstream, Inc. and Core.  They deliberately destroyed the legacy chain's utility.  We cannot control the bunch of people who don't think for themselves and followed along.  Those people tuned into Youtube and r\bitcoin to be told what to think, and they bought Corespeak h hook, line and sinker.  While I am sorry for them, and hate that they were taken advantage of, I believe this lesson is important.  Over time we will benefit.
"
another eth hodler, i still have a few bch too..  it's much better to have both networks (BCH and ETH) going.  and there will probly be a few other big ones as well.
Yep. I'm hold both coins. Different niches, peaceful coexistance
Eth isn't meant to be a currency, but it is one despite that.
"Good point about Eth foundation being in Switzerland.  

The West is communist too, just a different brand.  Mises identified the German strain and the Russian strain (of communism).  The German strain has evolved into a subscription model.  The West already has socialized welfare, retirement, housing, health care, but, like India, the West is developing a caste system to impose upon nonsubscribers. The intent is to have at the top r-selected, communist glee, which will be subsidized by laborers at the bottom. This is already here and it's not really new.  

This is why western institutions will back BTC, some western companies (particularly big ones, aligned with the state) will do the same, they know what's coming and don't want to be on the bottom side."
I'm just saying that wall st money is imminent, and oil money probably a few years.
You clearly have no actual understanding of how the global financial system works my friend :)
I hope you do know btc is the centralized coin here? Bch is not.... 
Well don't invest in what you don't understand.
Sorry the euphoria is out of control right now and I can’t help myself sometimes. Personally I’m not trying to get rich off crypto so if bch ever does become the bitcoin I’ll switch over as the price approaches parity. I won’t pretend I know what’s fueling the current market but it has been very interesting to watch and a good opportunity to learn.

"> The rest of the world has been looking for an opportunity to break away from the petroldollar for decades. They can do that now with Bitcoin Cash.

The market cap needs to be much higher before we can price oil deals in cryptocurrency. You need to be able to make multibillion dollar movements that also DO NOT move the market significantly. And we're nowhere near that."
"You think Korea is a proxy for any country other than Korea...? Wow. I live in Asia. Asians think of Koreans as Americans. China follow Korea? LMAO and Japan will go contrary to Korea just out of basic spite. Besides the fact that they are loyal early adopters - if BCH gets Japanese gov't stamp of approval MAYBE they'll flock. But you're talking about a nation that still uses fax machines everywhere as a matter of course. You've lost your mind. 

And if you think that Wall Street money - which is, what, 1000 times bigger than all crypto? - won't be the deciding factor in which crypto is the winner then you're just a fool.

And, seriously, the petrodollar? The crypto that does that will have to be the most secure and developed and longest lasting. You think nation-states and mega corps care they have to pay a few dollars instead of a few cents per transaction and that it may take a tiny bit longer? You're nuts. They care about it being done right, not faster, just better.

BCH: Good for coffee and broken promises. Wake up man. Being easy to transact gives it the same value as an ATM card."
"> I think BTC can only survive this short term hashpower battle if it hardforks the lift the blocksize cap. 

That would requires \*gasp* a HARDFORK! 

I'm pretty sure that if BTCore is forced to hardfork that they will roll out a PoW change in retaliation.

This is great though, we're already deep into their nightmare scenario, and their cheering at the end of B2x should now become fear in their bones.

Still seeing a lot of self-delusion on r/btc though.

> And if that comes from Core it would ruin their whole narrative. Possible that 2x will decide it really was a good idea to fork. The market signal couldn't be any clearer.

The end of B2x clearly signalled that everyone who thought we could increase the blocksize on the BTCore chain had to abandon that project, and they are.

What BTCore may not like is that when Wall Street comes to invest, they might also simply invest in BCH, seeing it as the superior chain and the superior value proposition, both on price and features."
At this rate it certainly looks awesome and plausible, I could easily be wrong. We shall see.
Lol how is that going 
You mean HODL on to It? 🤣
:) who are we kidding, who's sleeping tonight.
If it actually flipped in a day that would be earthshattering. That would be lights out for BTC.

"What’s that? The sdk?

Eth fanboy back again - love the btc vs. bch thing going on right now, super entertaining and interesting. Just wanted to echo that I think Ethereum is not meant to be a currency and that we can all live happily together. We're all just blocks on the chain anyway...
"Btc will always be dominated by chinese communist miners 

Why would any western company back any version of btc

Eth foundation is based in switzerland

Guess why"
I understand that nor I'm I saying that cryptocurrency is going to replace the petrodollar overnight. What I am saying is that Wall Street doesn't determine the outcome of the whole world.  If Wall Street wants to put their money into BTC they will eventually come out on the short end because the rest of the world is not Wall Street.
"> The market cap needs to be much higher before we can price oil deals in cryptocurrency.

Agreed.  Which is why if Asia is seeing BCH as being the strongest likely contender they are likely to start piling capital in it ASAP.  Legacy Bitcoin wasn't going to do it.  Ethereum is proving it really isn't well suited as a reserve currency.  What else you got, really?  Ripple?  Dash?  A state crypto?  BCH has all the benefit of *real Bitcoin* unleashed from its capacity constraint. There are incredible rewards for spotting the opportunity and being an early mover."
Cant believe the level of delusion on here. Why would anyone want a centralized BCH coin? or are they shills? good ones at that.
Firstly, I didn't say that it would just that it could. Secondly I said within the next week. But yeah - the momentum may have stalled. We'll see. 
I know I should care more, but my years of zen master training is preventing me from getting worked up yet. Maybe tomorrow it will sink in and you can regale me of the bitcoinity gif stories.

Noticed that bithumb stopped bch trading right after I made the post. I've been saying in the whole time giving people warnings. There is something shady with the way bch was handled by them. Curious what their statement will be and if regulators will audit them for this
Quadriga is the only one I know of. They are legit, just takes some time to get verified and fund your account. Prices on par with the market, minimal fees.
"QuadrigaCX is the best one for Canada. I haven't found one that supports credit card, but you can use your checking account with it. EFT Withdrawal funding is the most compatible way. Feel free to PM me (or reply to this comment if you have any questions).

So an artificial pump is a good way to convince all exchanges to accept something? Seems there are so many coins that would qualify. 
Oh my gosh, I have wanted to buy some and was waiting for a good chance. Now its high.

Guess not. Don't bet against the honey badger. 
It's a PnD. And it looks like the pump is over and now is the dump. BCH down 38% in 1 hour.  ETH is back in 2nd place now.

"As an Ethereum fanboy, it's a little sad to see it dislodged from second place like this. However, I don't expect it'll lose the second-place slot for all that long - Ethereum will move back up to #2 again once the Bitcoin Segwit chain descends below it.

(Apologies for this brief moment of rah-rah ""my sports team is best"" silliness. :)"
This is gentlemen!
One more to go!!
As a Ethereum holder only I'm glad that just happend. It's worth to add that Bitcoin market cap just fell thought 100 bill, its big. You guys killing it. I think that cryptocurrencies should be fast and cheap, and I accept any crypto on the throne as long as it is like that. Hope you will get 100 bill as Bitcoin Core will fall to 500$, there's no place for regression in progressive environment. And yeaa, I will still hold Ethereum as i think there's a place for us 2. We share similar vision.
Okay now bitcoin core tomorrow?!!
What exactly does this mean? 
To the moon!!! ┗(°0°)┛ .⋅°
And... it's gone, It's all gone!

"Wow, IT CONTINUES.  

Bitcoin Cash has skyrocketed up to $31B market cap/$1856 each, legacy chain all the way down to $96.5B/$5791 per token!

Bitcoin Cash is going to the edge of the Universe not just moon and Mars. 
Cool, but I already met the world's tallest midget.
... aaaaaand it's gone......
Wanna thank Parity bug, cause when it happened I've sold all my Ether for BCH (price was 600)
This is a true pump and dump.
Shit, i need to get into this.
As an ETH head, i am truly happy to see this. I've said it before but I'll say it again, bitcoin was my first love and got me involved in the crypto scene. I was extremely disappointed by the censorship and dishonest tactics of blockstream/bitcoin core in promoting their vision alone and stifling those who truly gave a shit about the network. I am so happy to see bitcoin cash finally starting to emerge as the true bitcoin. This is super exciting!
Satoshi Nakamoto is smiling on us today.
dictatorial drama is what all your bitcoin related forks and core guys are
"They can't spam the network to great effect; they tried a concerted spam attack in August. BCH swallowed up their tens of thousands of transactions in no more than 5 blocks, and the spam was promptly stopped. It was a total waste of money. It will be even harder now. To spam the BCH blockchain, you need to actually possess BCH. Many of the Kore Kool-Aid drinkers sold theirs off already."
"BCH is a pump and dump scheme if I've ever seen one.

It has more flaws than BTC, I would hodl off on the praise just yet when 90% of it's value has come in what, a day? lol..."
"Eth will win in the end

 Btc brand is toxic"
Your coin is not worth 1700 at all
Yep, agree. Vitalik saw a long time ago that working on BTC is not viable with the current dev team.
Actually here's the real reference for that expression: http://aaplinvestors.net/marketing/seriously/
I always thought Vitalik was great. If you have a vision go ahead and build it. North Coreans act like people who build alt coins or fork Bitcoin are some kind of traitors and they should eternally be loyal to the brand. That's not how it works.
Why don't you ask Vitalik? I only reposted his Tweet here. I don't care about what Roger does.

I don't think anyone actually spams blockchains except for special big trolling transactions. Social engineering attacks are cheaper and more effective. My guess than in August the smartest money flipped. People can do math
Since the two chains are so similar it'd have to be a zero-day that BCH has and BTC doesn't, otherwise it might lead to mutual annihilation.
There's been a lot of incredibly embarrassing behavior from industry incumbents shooting their own business models in the foot. 
"Ltc is the 2nd oldest coin

Your ponzi btc cash is weeks old and done zip"
"I think the biggest reason is that Segwit2x was canceled. That reduced uncertainty about the future and showed two clear choices; Bitcoin Segwit or Bitcoin Cash. The market participants seem to see the obvious choice now which is the Bitcoin version that is designed to scale primarily on-chain, coincidentally just like the Bitcoin whitepaper always intended.

I started thinking that it's become more than 50 % probable that we're going to witness a quick cashening event as soon as I saw that the Bitcoin Cash exchange rate had become 1 200 USD / BCC half a day ago. Now I think it's 70 % likely that Bitcoin Cash will take the number one market cap spot within a few days and then keep that spot for the foreseeable future. I'm optimistic."

"Can you explain In what ways you think BCH is more popular than ETH?

Last I checked, ETH had 40k+ developers, more transactions per day, more projects, more adoption, more nodes.. and the list goes on.

Marketcap is not everything, Ripple has a true marketcap higher than BCH right now."
The original ledger is just sitting there yawning. Price unmoved from the mid 7000s (BCH+BTC). Hodlers unaffected while a giant wealth transfer occurs in the trenches of the blocksize war.
Yep
Yeah looks like someone put buy orders for more than 10k BCH at 0.5BTC to force other buyers to bid higher.  Then once the price went up, he proceeded to sell some of its BCH at high price and then cancelled the buy orders.
"Koreans went to sleep. 

Mempool keeps growing. BTCs cannot get onto exchanges fast enough."
or a pump and dump? is no one considering the fact that exchanges might dump all the unclaimed bch and drive the price low again?
It is certainly happening much sooner than I had anticipated. I thought for sure that the price would not do too much until after the Monday hard fork to change the EDA. Just wait until all the BTC that is currently stuck in the mempool trying to get onto the exchanges finally clears! --- That is if they will EVER clear?
When coinbase allows people to split their bch out in January, you will see a lot of selling. A large amount of bch is currently locked away. 
I don't even care whether BCH or ETH gets first place, as they are both good coins. I'm just happy that BTC gets dethroned.
nothing until shit levels out in the next few days and people start asking what happened
"> Ethereum will move back up to #2 again once the Bitcoin Segwit chain descends below it.

Now that's optimistic! :) That would be nuts to see."
I agree with this assessment. I really like Ethereum also. It will have number two status again soon behind Bitcoin Cash's first place. 
This I can get behind :)
i deposited onto Coinbase. Bought ETH. Transfered ETH to another exchange. And bought BCH. All on Wednesday of last week. First crypto purchase, long time follower. I saw a shift coming.

"The Koreans are asleep now. Let's see what happen after they wake up. It will be Monday morning for them.

I'd be more worried about a zero-day.
Does anyone know how to get a bitcoin cash in Canada? I'm brand new to crypto. I looked it up and found some sites with credit card but they are offering coins at 50% more expensive than market rate. Help?

"I'll accept that point if segwit remains largely unadopted in a year's time. Right now it is too early to draw meaningful conclusions. Don't let that stop your misinformation campaign though, I don't want to spoil your fun.

The fact is that the activation of segwit was never certain so most wallet devs would be taking quite a chance to develop a Segwit UI before the activation date. And developing good software takes time so now we just have to be a little patient."
The constant removal of facts and allowing misleading opinions on r/bitcoin turn me, eventually I saw that *all* the censorship supported one side, while the facts that I knew to be true kept being removed or distorted, and any corrections removed. 
"If there was an overwhelming consensus that BTC was going down in price and was going to permanently stay down, you would see a lot of ""so many millionaires"" cashing out."
"Bitcoin don't need any utility or fundamentals. It is already proven. It is a basically a savings account. It is not ment for buying coffee or shopping online. Stop trying to be a smart ass like you know anything. The fact remains that exchanges are staying with BTC as main trading pairs shows that bitcoin is not going anywhere. 
"
"This sub is entirely different, because there is no censorship. This is easy to verify if you're so inclined, just like the extreme censorship on /r/bitcoin is easy to verify.

And the fact that, in the open forum, the vast majority of people now support bitcoin cash should really tell you something. Wake up.

The holder of BTC can make their BTC triple value or even quadruple by just selling and buying BCH now. It is more a divorce from an old boring partner for a young sportive and dynamic one. :D
"So many reasons: much better back end, faster transactions, lower fees, scalability, and primarily the support of the dapps/tokens. All coins that don't offer scalability through contracts are limited in scope and capability.

Also, what's wrong with pushing for big blocks?"
"Wat.

No. It's the same BTC w 8 MB blocks as pre Segwit w a little difficulty adjustment jazz added. Only software upgrades are necessary for merchants, exchanges etc. - very simple software upgrades."
It is Bitcoin. BItcoin Cash. And then there's Bitcoin Segwit. Both are Bitcoin, it's just that Bitcoin Cash is much more like the original Bitcoin. And quite frankly, the people over on the Segwit have been rather unfriendly. It's just hasn't felt good over there on r/Bitcoin.

I want it, and I don't want the legacy coin, and I've been telling everyone who I told years ago to buy bitcoin the same thing
I wouldn't want to underestimate their stupidity .... but also note that hypocrisy seems something they're perfectly comfortable with. 
"Yes, they can change difficult adjustment, proof of work, or anything else to save their chain, and they probably would. Heck, they could even raise the blocksize if that's the only option too keep their status as the ""original developers"". The problem with this is that many people that they have convinced that ""hard-forks are bad"" will see the light then, and possibly move to BCH. Pointing to BCH saying ""they did it"" would be even more ironic after all the ""it's a worthless shitcoin"" narrative they've built. In any case, they would alienate many users that they themselves had convinced.

I still think they would do it, but I wouldn't be too surprised if they let the chain die out if arrogance. they will probably hold off doing anything like that for as long as possible. But by then it might be too late. "
">  If you want me to shill that 'Bitcoin Core is going to die no matter what' well that's just wrong and unrealistic, so you do that, and I'll stick to a reasonable analysis of the facts. 

This is called a strawman. You are trying to imply that I think Bitcoin Core will die no matter even though I have never made that claim.

You say you are not here to shill but your posting suggests otherwise.

Changing the proof of work will destroy any credibility and power they have. This is a fact. There are ways they can survive, but that isn't one of them."
"Irony is dead, though, so only you, I, and the non-ironically-challenged would really notice, or even care if someone brought it to their attention. It's hard to overstate just how purely tribal online society has become.

Two things I can see killing the chain: (1) Total loss of confidence as a 'store of value' due to the price hitting the floor, or (2) the Core dev team quits."
"Who exactly do you think I'm shilling for? Get real.

You give Core's followers way too much credit. I'll make a prediction right now. They *will* change the proof of work, and it will only ""destroy their credibility"" in the minds of Bitcoin Cash supporters. As long as their price stabilises, they will not lose any support over changing the proof of work. In fact — they will gain some due to overselling the benefits of the new algorithm."

A troll who hates bitcoin is pretty uneducated about Bitcoin? I'm not surprised though."
"160,000 transactions and climbing, 1 block every 25-40 minutes. That's a full day to process all the unconfirmed transactions if new ones stop pouring in. Sadly, that's not happening. There was a 3000 transaction increase over the last 2 blocks meaning that 3000 more transactions came in that went out. Currently if you have paid less than $100 fees on your transaction, forget it!

All this price pumping, I suspect, are from clueless investors who want to jump on the bitcoin bandwagon because they think it will go up forever. Those guys will be stuck without a chair pretty soon and start dumping it. 

As far as the mindless core army: I do not care what a couple hundred half a bitcoin investors in r/bitcoin think or do as they have almost no power here.

It was a bad idea. No matter how much hashpower 2x had it would never have been bitcoin. Bitcoin cash isn’t bitcoin either, you can’t have names changing around. Even if you think bitcoin cash is better you shouldn’t try to rename it, and confuse newbies.
"Well Bitcoin Cash is the bitcoin most people signed up for

Legacy Bitcoin is a *newly designed* system built on the idea of always full blocks and high fees.

So when I invested in Bitcoin, I invested in what is now Bitcoin Cash, and not what is now legacy bitcoin.

So clarifying the difference is useful"
"no.. I bet btc will still have a significant value after all is done. look at that shitty bitcoin sub.. its just memes and ATH posts and hodlers everywhere. they are grinning like crazy that they are able to buy ""cheaper coins"" right now."
"Why not both?

Hold 1 BTC and 1 BCH let the best man win.  If you wanted to be risky you coudl change BTC->BCH 6 to 1 right now, but it's not without it's risk.  

What if a BTC ETF comes out?  That is moon time for BTC."

The point is that Bitcoin cash follows the rules of the original Bitcoin before core held it back to create a need for Blockstream's sidechains. Therefore Bitcoin cash is Bitcoin, the way I remember it back in 2013.
Editing reality is what 2017 is about!
"wait six months, it wont be called cash then, just bitcoin ;)"
I don't get why you guys try so hard to say it's Bitcoin... Why not market the point of difference?

"You mean just like they could push out an update increasing the block size to 8MB? That would fix the whole mempool in less than 10 blocks.

No wait because some poverty stricken person in a third world country needs to _run a full node in their house_, your money is stuck in an inefficient bloated fucking mess. "
Mike Hearn is another major player in the early bitcoin game.
