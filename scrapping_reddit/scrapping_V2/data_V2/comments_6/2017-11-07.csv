You don't need to store the full blockchain. Pruned nodes are no less secure and can use less than 1GB of disk regardless of the size of the full blockchain.
Yep.  Bitcoin is kept decentralized through a system of checks and balances between miners and nodes.  Sadly a lot of people don't understand this and pick a team and stay loyal too it. /r/btc is the pro miners anti node sub Reddit and /r/Bitcoin is the pro nodes anti miners sub Reddit. It's ashame what a shit show the Bitcoin community has becomes over the years to the point people don't even understand how Bitcoin works or what's best for Bitcoin instead it's just about tribalism.

"Kinda.  

The point is to have usable p2p cash.  While user have the option to have a full node to verify transactions, ideally businesses would do this in order to have faster confirmation times for their businesses.  

Also, keep in mind that we are nowhere near that level of needing 500mb blocks.  A full node is less than 200gb right now (gained about 40gb this year), so with affordable consumer HDDs in the TB range, we have plenty of time before we need to worry about full nodes being out of range of users.  

If Moore's law fails us eventually, then we can stress then.  "

">If the chain is already congested, you can't open a channel.


Of course which is why we need to scale onchain to. Thing is the chain regardless of block size will be far less congested when the vast majority of transactions are done offchain.  Therefore there's less bloat onchain and less congestion when opening/closing a payment channel.

"> but i dont agree that bitcoin is enterprise level tech now

Well, honestly that is just a simple reality now. Do you think most of the network is some guy in his garage, or full datacenters full of miners now? It's been the later now for years.

Do you want Bitcoin to be run on redundant, professional level gear with professional IT support? Or a bunch of nobodies running their nodes on old desktops? I definitely want Bitcoin to be hardened by the best tech and the best technicians. Miners and businesses are really the only ones that need full nodes, SPV takes care of end users. There is nothing stopping anyone from running a full node if you want, in that it is always decentralized, it just isn't practical for most non-enterprise users to do this. 

By hindrance I mean that some nodes are only effectively leeches on the network that don't actually add anything if misconfigured or are truly on low bandwidth connections. A home node with no miners is not really adding much more than being another relay if configured properly. Not to discourage people from doing this ( I do), but my node is not as relevant as enterprise nodes with mining support."
"> businesses that have the capability to store such large amounts of data

It isn't large amounts of data, in fact, home hobby users could handle Visa-scale onchain Bitcoin with a modern computer and gigabit internet, *which tens of millions of people already have*.  But home users are not the intended backbone of the Bitcoin network and end-users don't need to keep a copy of everyone else's transactions to use Bitcoin as intended.

> Isn't the point of bitcoin so that anyone can participate in the network by having a full copy of the blockchain?

No!  The point is to have total control over your own currency, which you do simply by holding Bitcoin onchain in a wallet whose keys you exclusively control.  The point was never ""everyone runs a node"":

> The current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale.  That would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server.  The design supports letting users just be users.  The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be.  Those few nodes will be big server farms.  The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don't generate.

"And youre a shill.

""Gravity"" is the only force in existance that doesn't pull on objects uniformly. All other forces pull whatever it is pulling equally hard towards itself. With the magical force of ""gravity"" it consciously choose to apply different force depending on the size of the object. It's strong enough to hold trillions of tons of water to a ball yet nice enough to not pull so hard on the insects. No other force does that, it's as if an insanely strong electromagnet or an unimaginably strong windtunnel somehow chooses to be nice to the little objects. It just doesn't happen in reality.

People say a heliumballoon rises because it's less dense than air, but apparently when something falls it's not because it's denser than the surrounding medium, it's because of ""graaavity"". With that logic, the heliumballoon is now an antrigravity device, and for some reason gravity decides to turn off when objects happen to be less dense than the surrounding medium."

You sound like a flat earther. 
Sorry I didn’t get back to you sooner but I’m on vacation and trying to participate in this conversation on my cell in between family events. The study was posted by another commenter in the thread. You pose a good question. I’m not certain but I imagine it is not full mining nodes. The discussion around a nodes worth to the network is also elsewhere in this thread. Again, I apologize that I’m able to better reference it, but I’m currently limited.
If you're not willing to verify a statement don't make it. 
GPU's have literally nothing to do with this topic. I think you are confused, and you definitely are no 'old-school' bitcoiner as this is pretty basic stuff.
"If you are unwilling to provide proof for claims you should stop making them.

A claim that can't be verified is worthless."
"The thing is capable of and should be are two different things. The bigger the blocks the less individuals running the nodes and therefore the more centralized. We are dependent on there being enough honest nodes not to censor transaction to make the network censorship resistant. We are dependent on there being a large enough amount of individuals rather than a few large players to run nodes to make it so that rules like 21 million max coins, 10 minute blocks times, etc are all enforced and unchanged. 

So yes we could probably handle 1 GB blocks if we really wanted today, but it'd be a highly centralized system in contrast to what we have today as a result of smaller blocks. This is why it's important to find solutions to scale that allow us to use block space as efficiently as possible. Yes we need bigger blocks and all but we should try and keep them reasonably small else wise it becomes far too centralized of a network."
Even as a rough guess, how many nodes worldwide would be running? There's like 100,000 nodes going on btc, and I know a bunch of them are raspberry pi's. 
then wouldn't businesses that have the capability to store such large amounts of data be the only ones that have full nodes? Isn't the point of bitcoin so that anyone can participate in the network by having a full copy of the blockchain?
"Now, collaborate this with a comment slightly above this. that ""for 7 billion people to open/close 1 LN channel per year, we'd need 133 Mb blocks"".

I think *everyone* - even core - *agrees* that we might need bigger block. It's just that it's preferable to keep them small, to increase the possibility to run full nodes and mining operations.

Everyone also agrees that bandwith and disk space increases over time. This is why segwit effective blocksize increase now is acceptable, but doubling that again would be a little much now.

Also: Compare 2 transactions per year for a LN channel for each of 7 billion users, with 1000 transactions per year without LN. Now do the block size calculations, please."

Craig Wright is a joke. No doubt intelligent, but the dude is shady af. This comes from a supporter of both small and big blocks. 
"Yeah that's what LN will be for. So you can pay $10 once to then transact Bitcoin thousands of times for only a few cents and do so with 0 confirmations, instantly, and streamably. 

That's cheaper even than big enough blocks to accommodate  small transactions as any network big enough regardless of block size will make it cost prohibitive to buy a coffee onchain.

We still need bigger blocks obviously because even LN can't function in the long term without blocks of a few hundred MBs. But none the less the $5 it costs to do an onchain transaction with proper technologies is well worth it as day to day tx can be done off chain and it provides us with greater decentralization. "

Lol. Diane proved my point.  Her simulation had people only able to transfer a tiny amount and have many channels open. And I answered other objections in my followup which is linked from the bottom of the original article
"1. Immutability: nobody can mute you. Nobody can stop you from transacting with anyone else in the world, from anywhere, at any time, in any amount. 

2. Irreversibility: Once a miner has performed the proof of work to write your transaction to the blockchain, there are no steps that you can begin to take to attempt to take it back. You would have to redo the proof of work which is all but impossible. 

3. Decentralization: This one is often mischaracterized but In Bitcoin, it means everyone has the same privileges. Nobody is allowed to do anything that anyone else is not, anyone may begin mining or transacting, there are no barriers to entry. Contrast this with the fiat banking system: You have people who are allowed to create money out of thin air but everyone else has to work for it. This is centralized.

Side note on Decentralization: Low fees (I'm talking 1 cent or less) are crucial to maintaining decentralization because anything other than an extremely negligible fee starts pricing use cases off the blockchain, **centralizing it.** 

These 3 are some of the main defining properties of Bitcoin. But it has been mathematically proven that LN, due to the **centralized** Hub structure, which is a different topology than Bitcoin, can not scale in a decentralized fashion.

"There are simply no ""use cases"" for a BTC 0-conf. 

0-conf is used for small value transactions which are the vast majority of merchant transactions.

BTC fees have long since driven off these small value customers.

>  I just asked why Bicashers hate RBF so much. 

Obviously you have never sold a merchant on accepting BTC as you would realise RBF is seriously hard to explain. Merchants find it not worth their trouble accepting BTC when there isn't that big a customer demand in any case. These early merchant adopters are vital for building that customer demand, something segwit core fails to understand.

On the other hand, the simplicity of Bitcoin Cash 0-conf instant transactions allows a merchant to get started with nothing more than a *qrcode* with customers immediately enjoying the 0-conf benefits. Merchants can dabble and have fun accepting Bitcoin Cash as it is unencumbered with these unnecessary complications. This is one of the reasons Bitcoin Cash is gathering new merchants so rapidly.

It is worth mentioning that Bitcoin Cash is gathering new users rapidly also. The fastest way to win a new Bitcoin Cash user is to gift them a 'coffee' worth of Bitcoin Cash, something no longer possible with BTC's fees.

Thanks to the brilliance of segwit core, BTC is a dead coin walking.

> I just also understand how LN works 

Please explain then:

In section 2 of the lightning white paper the author claims that Lightning transactions and channel state is private (the old ""the whole world doesn't need to know about your coffee transaction"" argument).

If channels are private so that their state and state changes are secret, how can they be used by everyone else for routing, without revealing information about their state, and if it changes?

Is it not the case that this dilemma was pointed out over a year ago and that the author still has no workable solution?

____

Elsewhere you said that a Lightning user remains 100% in control of his funds. If so, how can I use your funds to route my transactions, and while I'm using them for my routing, how can you claim to control them 100%?  Also, if you and your channel partner cannot agree on channel state, isn't it the case that your funds could remain locked for days or longer until the channel timeout expires? How can you claim that is 100% control?

____

Bonus question: since another specific party has the power to jam up the money in your channel until a timeout expires, isn't that a prima facia case for regulation and licensing...?

____

Maybe LN is not ""evil"" but it is definitely ""damagingly oversold."" I hope that it gets built and find use cases that are not dependent on wild overselling of the potential of this technology."

If Satoshi came out against them they would plan his assassination because they wouldn't be able to divert the world otherwise. 

I think the idea of forks need to be understood as a strength, not a weakness. But I think most people don't really get the concept of a fork yet and so there are still many many lessons to learn about cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology in general.

But if you believe in democracy at all then the ability to create a decentralized system is extremely valuable and regardless what happens to Bitcoin, this will see tomorrow."

I've never seen anyone say that these people are the developers behind Bitcoin Cash. Do you have a website explaining this? Because so far all I got is your post.

I agree. You shouldn't have shit in the punchbowl with your BS about how Craig, Roger, and Gavin are big fans of centralizing the network.  I hang out here in uncensored rbtc so I get to hear what these people say instead of having it censored and spoonfed to me in deceptive soundbites, you lies about these people (not to mention waving their names around in the first place like a big troll flag) really did put a damper on quality discussion.  But if you'd like to get back on track with some sort of actual point I'll hear you out.
"Nodes have nothing to do with development. Why would I need any development experience to understand the structure or function of cryptocurrency? I dont understand your point at all. 

If you think a crypto user needs dev experience to use it or participate in the network, then crypto is truly doomed. This was a civil discussion until you showed up."
"OK let me break it down.

> Craig speaks of a *centralized ledger ""Paypal 2.0"".

No, he doesn't.

>  Roger was for quite a while explaining that full-nodes are harmful for Bitcoin  and should be replaced by central systems.

No, he wasn't and no, he didn't.

> And if I read the comments well even Gavin's (and others) recent technical improvement proposal for the block propagation is basically weakening of the peer-to-peer concept.

No, it's not.

In short, he's just full of shit."
"I think it would reduce value of all chains if a major attack like that happened. Probably all cryptocurrencies. I think it would cost a lot and be a huge gamble as to whether it is profitable.

It is more profitable to follow the rules. "
"> Now one company manufactures all the ASICs on the network. Remember this is the company that put a call home script in their miners that allows them to turn the miner off remotely. It creates a systemic risk and makes hash rate meaningless

That therefore would be very stupid for a company that has invested $100m+ into creating a device that has no purpose whatsoever other than providing the hash rate you say they have made meaningless through bad strategy.  Seems like a self-correcting problem if you ask me.  Or maybe you have a few facts wrong."

"Because the ROI is insane. I don't really care that much about the ideology surrounding this.

How does it work if not like that? That has very little to do with Bitcoin and much more to do with the laws of physics."
With chains like BTC and BCH competing for hashpower, a 51% attack may not intend to “steal”, but rather to delegitimize or sabotage faith in the network. Lets say you own a lot of BCH and attempt a 51% on the BTC chain. If you succeed and it is reversed, or even if you fail but the attack goes noticed by enough people to be reported, faith in the chain and technology takes a nose dive and BTC would see a mass exodus, likely to the competitor BCH. I dont think either of us need to run any numbers to see how this could be extremely profitable in the long run. You could also recycle the hashpower (or nodepower) on the BCH chain after the flippening. Huge $.
"They don't have to actually sue for the patent to be a problem. To become a viable mining competitor $100m+ will need to be invested. Companies aren't going to do that with even a slight chance of legal repercussion if they try to level the playing field by implementing ASICboost on their own machines.

You can buy the miners they produce and run those, which is what they want, everyone buying their miners. If their miners have ASICboost with a 20% efficiency people will buy their miners over competitors. Now one company manufactures all the ASICs on the network. Remember this is the company that put a call home script in their miners that allows them to turn the miner off remotely. It creates a systemic risk and makes hash rate meaningless as a security mechanism because you end up having to trust a single company.

"> What I don't get about your Craig rendition is I recall Gavin sits with him privately and the. Says he confirmed the key to him. Then in public he didn't confirm it. Why would Gavin say he's craig? We can make the argument that Craig is a fraud but gavin is on core or was...he knows Bitcoin and how public private key pairs work better than most...so I find this all hard to believe

As I said, this was done on Craig's own laptop. Gavin might be a good cryptographic engineer, but he can't know if a signature is valid by looking at it.

How he bamboozled Gavin and Jon was likely one of two ways:

1. He used a publicly available message and signature (like he did with his provably-fraudulent public proof).
2. He used a modified version of the signature-verification software that generated a bullshit signature that looks about right, then his fake signature verification software just confirmed that it was correct (even though it wasn't).

At the time he was very keen on people thinking he was Satoshi, even gave the community a public ""proof"" in the form of a signature. When people spotted how he'd done it, he backed into ""oh, I can't do it, I thought I could but I can't face outing myself definitely"" etc. Everything about that whole episode is suspect.

> I still think the argument that Craig didn't want to get assassinated as being a valid motive for backing out of it.

So why is he still making a public figure out of himself and trying to horde patents while never publicly repudiating his claims?

> Remember he came out of 'hidjng' as core was taking Bitcoin down a very dangerous Trojan horse infested path. He is trying to save Bitcoin and that's how I see it too.

This is fantasyland wishful thinking that has no basis in reality and is literally a form of ""he says things I agree with so I think he's Satoshi"".

To play devil's advocate, there is *only* one message since Satoshi disappeared that isn't totally debunked, and he's coming out against a contentious block-size hard fork.

I'm not saying I believe the message is real, but looking at the headers etc, it's not obvious how it was done, if it is a fake.

"Okay, that is a possible attack. My point is that it is unlikely to work. Nodes work on rating systems and they find other nodes that they like. So it would be nearly impossible to have enough malicious nodes to control the network. Far greater than 51%. So when Bitcoin is used by a lot of businesses and has a high block size/transaction throughput that requires a reasonably powerful computer to run a full node, most businesses will run a full node with rated peers, and it will likely not be possible to fool them. Just spinning up 10000 nodes doesn't make them automatically accepted as ""good"" peers to existing nodes. Also, with a fraction of the hash power of the rest of the chain, the valid proof of work blocks would be much slower than the actual longest proof of work chain, so the ruse would have to be maintained for a long time, in which the node you are attacking could likely figure out something is wrong. No one accepts million dollar transactions on 1 confirm.

By bad data I mean invalid signatures or not enough proof of work for the current chain difficulty. Things that can be independently verified instantly. Basically, the only thing that can't be independently verified short term is ""double spends"" of recent UTXOs if a node is somehow kept from seeing the longest proof of work chain.

The good data can be intentionally not propagated, but it can't be made invalid, again, except for in the short term the ""double spend"" of a recent UTXO that we have been talking about.

In either case this is still similar to a 51% attack. Not very profitable. You are spending a lot of money to do this attack to steal Bitcoins. It won't go unnoticed on the network, and you are devaluing the Bitcoins you are stealing. As Satoshi designed, it is more profitable to follow the rules and just use that money toward benevolent mining."

"No idea. Here try [this](https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/7081868) fact, it's two years old:

> According to Pew’s research, which surveyed about 1,000 people in each nation, 89 percent of adults now own a smartphone or basic cell phone in South Africa and Nigeria, 83 percent in Senegal and Ghana, 82 percent in Kenya, 73 percent in Tanzania and 65 percent in Uganda.

[But only 34% have banking.](http://datatopics.worldbank.org/financialinclusion/region/sub-saharan-africa)

That's right. **Twice as many people in subsaharan Africa can use Bitcoin as have bank accounts.**"
flat rate for a week here in Manila can be had for under a dollar. 
"If you have 51% of the hash power, then you don't need to control nodes. The chain you produce is valid because it has the most proof of work. Valid nodes not controlled by you will follow your chain.

If you don't have 51% hash power then the chain you produce is not the one with most proof of work. Any valid node can independently verify if a transaction is valid or not as long as at least one of the nodes it is connected to has seen the valid chain. You need a lot more than 51% of nodes in order for a node to not see the longest chain, unless you can somehow manipulated the network and control which nodes another node connects to. Most nodes connect to at least 8 other nodes. You would need enough miners to produce valid proof of work, not the most proof of work, but still above the chains current difficulty for probably more than 7 blocks. Have a ""double spend"" transaction on your new branch of the chain, plus enough nodes that all 8 of the nodes connect to by the node you are attacking are controlled by you. This is assuming you have some way of cashing in on your double spend with some subset of nodes that you have separated from the rest of the network. With many thousands of nodes out there this would be hard to do.

edit - They do not have equal footing as a miner. Miners produce blocks with proof of work which takes a lot of processing power. Nodes just verify and propagate. They have no power to change anything. The only thing they can do maliciously is exclude data or propagate bad data. Any bad data will immediately be invalidated by any other node. If they exclude data, any node that isn't excluding it will override them immediately."

"ASIC mining becoming more efficient is neutral for bitcoin as a whole. It's not a problem. The problem comes from having one company in one jurisdiction with a patent which allows them to run 20% more efficiently than any other miners anywhere else. If all other miners and mining producers can implement ASICboost, then it is no problem, but the patent on it allows future legal action which has a cooling effect on the mining ecosystem. If ASICboost is viable on a coin It moves that  network from being secured by hashrate to being secured by contract law.

The reason Jihan loves BCH is he can monopolize it with ASICboost, but he fails to realize that the world is never going to value an ASICboost Coin  / China Patent Coin."
My point is that 0-conf is always toted as a feature to BCH when in reality every single crypto has 0-conf. It’s not a feature. It’s a choice of the merchants. The very same issue hits BCH when EDA gets gamed and blocks slow to a crawl. As you put it, no merchant is going to want to wait weeks for a transaction to clear. 
"In your second paragraph, you outline how an attack could work without 51% hashpower. You explicitly say that “with many thousands of nodes out there this would be hard to do”. This is exactly what I’m getting at: with bigger blocks killing 95% of nodes, it would make this attack MUCH easier. So, in reality, you strengthened my argument: you don’t even need 51% of hashpower to attack the chain, so long as you have enough nodes. Bigger blocks make this easier. 

Why would bad data be invalidated by a node if you own 51% of network power? Why wouldnt it be the reverse, that good data is invalidated by a malicious node on the 51% attackers chain?"
"Fair enough.

What I mean is you take their comments at face value and to be honest, I agree with most of the statement I've heard Craig say.

I don't care if he's Satoshi or not. I care about the argument out forward. 

Now censorship land r/Bitcoin criminals care a whole shitload about Craig because they know how many sheeple a bogus authority figure can inspire. And that's why people like yourself, who are staunch core supporters, make such a big deal out of wright. It's a propaganda issue.

Thank you. The field of crypto currency is not so much about investing as it is an element of gambling. My gamble is that enough people have invested into this for them not to make a run on the ""banks"" and kill any growth that has happened. X2 is interesting in that aspect. When you only invest as much as you can lose these things become interesting.

But look at [Bitcoin ABC](https://www.bitcoinabc.org/november), they do address what I mentioned previously:

> On a final note, Bitcoin ABC is committed to the values of decentralized development.  We strive to be a leading implementation and drive innovation and progress, but we do not wish to be THE leader, as we believe there should never be one singular authority.

> Although this time it is Bitcoin ABC’s proposal that is being put forth to the miners, we are confident that in time, other development teams will also see their ideas implemented as we move forward together as a united community.

They don't want to be the leader than publish these things, but they do acknowledge that there is a need for *someone* to do the actual action of publishing something. That role can change hands, and move around, but there is a person with the keys to publish things into the live code."

It's different that nobody owns it. You can just make a copy of the code and do the changes that you want and send it to the miners for review and implementation. Very neat system! But then if I do so it becomes *my* ideas. As opposed to the ideas of a CEO or lead dev somewhere."

Maybe in the world in general that is the true. Satoshi did a decent job of designing the system to prevent that so far. If Bitcoin isn't secure then why hasn't anyone successfully attacked it yet. There is a lot of money out there for the taking. If someone finds a way to break it then we will just have to find a way to prevent that in the future.
"> there is a person with the keys to publish things into the live code

What's ""the"" live code?  There are four compatible clients.  Miners and users can use any of them.  Any others can join and make other clients.  Any person can propose an improvement.  It's permissionless. Any user can run whatever code they like."
Lmao so explain the difference between immutable and irreversible. If Jessquit accepted my definitions I think they are fine 
"If they understood it was poor strategy then they would not do it, but the fact that they put scripts in their miners that create an attack vector to the network show that they do not really understand where a cryptocurrency's value is derived. The miners seem to think it is hash power, but they do not understand *why* hash power is used (as a neutral metric) and why it can therefore be abandoned based on community/user sentiment (for example during a 51% attack). 

You are right in that it is self correcting problem on the mining side, but only if miners are rational and fully understand the value proposition of a decentralized asset (something I think they do not understand being based in a politically communist jurisdiction). Luckily the fail safe is for the userbase to correct the problem via economic consensus - by valuing a coin that is decentralized over one that is centralized."
Murphy’s law doesn’t state WHEN things will go wrong, and similarly, there are many reasons why the attack is possible but hasn’t happened YET. Maybe the attacker doesn’t have the funds yet. Maybe the attacker hasn’t even heard of bitcoin yet. Maybe they’re waiting for 95% of nodes to be shutdown by big blocks... We don’t know. We can’t know. We can only do our best to position ourselves securely for the future. This is why I’m against big blocks.
Well, 95% of nodes won't be shut down anyway. I bet 95% of nodes can handle 8 MB blocks. I have a 6 year old AMD64 Linux machine that was $600 when new and it can handle 1 MB blocks without even noticing it. It takes a few seconds to download and process an entire 1 MB block.
"I'm asking you what you're on about.

A team makes a proposal; other teams and miners adopt it.

No button.  Invisible hand.  What's hard to understand?"
It’s not about processing 1mb or 8mb blocks, it’s about storing a massive blockchain. If 1mb blocks got us to 150ish GB up to now, imagine the size of the chain after just 1 year of 8mb blocks. Did you check out the study from BitFury?
"The person who sends the proposal to the miners and other teams -
 Who is that person?"
"Even if Bitcoin Cash had the same traffic as Bitcoin Core, the blocks would normally be a lot less than 8 MB. 150 GB isn't that much any more. Even if they were all full for a year, that would be 420 GB. A 4 TB drive is like $100. But you really shouldn't expect to run a node on a PC in the future. If there aren't enough businesses accepting Bitcoin and running full nodes to prevent attacks and centralization then there won't be enough traffic to worry about. 

The real scaling issue is the UTXO set, because it slows down transaction verification.

I will try to check out that study tomorrow. "

The peer to peer value of Bitcoin will he destroyed if it turns into a settlement layer. The peer to peer value of original Bitcoin (BCH) can legitimately go to a million USD per coin at current usd valuation.

It appears from the spec that this network divulges state information to the packet sender of various channels in the route, which does not sound like what was suggested by the white paper.
"I don't disagree with you, just pointing out the state of things now and probably for some time to come in USA fintech w.r.t. moving money. 

My best hope is that technology simply routes around and past the current restrictions using networks that are being tested now e.g. zcash, monero, others."

"Censorship resistance means that nobody can prevent you from transacting

Irreversibility means that once you've transacted, nobody can undo it.  This is the same thing as saying ""immutability"" (the blockchain cannot be mutated or changed after the fact) but ""irreversibility"" is a much clearer term IMO.  ""Immutability"" *also* can be used to mean 'the economic properties of the money cannot be changed' which is *not* strictly a property of blockchains.

"Not at all.

If you go to https://bitcoincash.com/faq/ you'll see the following:

> **Which Development Team is In Charge of Bitcoin Cash?**

>Unlike the previous situation in Bitcoin, there is no one single development team for Bitcoin Cash.  There are now multiple independent teams of developers. 

>This decentralization of development (and decentralization of software implementations) is a much needed and important step forward.

This contradicts what you said. And furthermore; it makes no sense. Someone is in control - always. I just want to know who."
"I don't really like Core, so no complaints here. And BCH seems to be working. But if we don't know who is making it then we don't really know what new plans they have in store for us.

Is Bitcoin ABC the same as Bitcoin Cash?"
"Yeah. I remember the days it started getting fishy. Then when r/btc came to challenge it, the full propaganda wing became very apparent. 

It was pretty self apparent because API linked to btc exchanges could automatically make trades using algorithms and web crawlers. What better place than having an easy identifiable score such as reddit. Positive bitcoin news was upvoted, boosting confidence and therefore price automatically as well. 

These forces were already in place before the fork debates got hot."
"I dont understand what you mean. Yes, some (but I concede not “most”) of the network are people with equipment in their garage. The existence of even just 1 of these people proves bitcoin is not enterprise level tech. I mine, I run a node, and my income is under 100k by a long shot. 

If my choices are only “professional level gear with professional IT support? Or a bunch of nobodies running their nodes on old desktops?”, as you say, then I choose the latter, because that is a decentralized topology and in line with the nature of bitcoin and crypto. It doesn’t matter if joe nobody’s node fails or a miner leaves, because the overall structure is meant to make that negligible. 

Just because a node is not as relevant as an enterprise level one doesnt mean its making a negative contribution to the network. To my understanding, you can only positively contribute to the network by running a node."
"Why on earth is that hopelessly outdated other than because you say so? 

Gold would be a much better settlement than Bitcoin if you want to talk about a 'settlement layer'. 

Bitcoin only makes sense as digital peer to peer (decentralized) currency. Money by the people for the people. 

You can try other experiments. There are a thousand other coins that have already done this and good luck to all of them. They think of other ideas and they try them out. 

But to subvert Bitcoin and change its goals? What non-hostile selfless reason could you really have at that point? "
If you want better fees, then use a better wallet. 
"That's not an argument. Not that you have any.

"I took that number from a statement earlier in the thread.

""7 billion users with one Lightning channel per year equals to 155 MB blocksize"".

I agree with you, if you read my comment. Lightning now should actully scale pretty well, but not for 7 billion users. That would require a block size change. But as you said, *that* would take years."
If peers can't participate in the actual peer to peer network  of Bitcoin (nodes) then how is Bitcoin P2P if the only people running nodes are in large data centers? /u/doorknob88 never said the point was  for everyone to run their node. Most people use SPV wallets today. But fact is bigger blocks means more resources to be a part of the P2P network of bitcoin nodes if anyone so desires to do so.
"Confirmation times are just as fast whether you run a node or not. The reason why a business would want to run a node is that it means they don't need to trust any third party as they validate the blocks themselves. 

Think Bitcoin is only P2P cash if it is done P2P and not through the use of a third party right? Well nodes are the only P2P part of the network, otherwise you're running a thin wallet which is dependent on connecting to third party of which runs a node on your behalf and of which you must trust to accurately be validating all blocks so as to not report you as have receiving  funds even though you didn't."

Not shitposting, but I definitely have a side. What's wrong with raspberry pi's? I prefer arguments to understand the other side better. Ad hominems help nobody. 
Current bitcoin mining doesn't even use GPU's. Of course you can mine alts with GPU's because the hash rate is so low because of low demand/value. But whatever is deemed 'the real bitcoin', isn't going to have any GPU's mining profitably.
I never claimed BTC or any other crypto is feasible for people living on 2$/day. Thats the claim i see for BCH daily here but no one seems to be able to really break down how that works.
Whats the cheapest service provider for that phone?
"Would you mind paying me 1cent today and doubling it everyday for a month please?

My point is that increasing block size isn’t the proper or complete solution to scaling, and can lead to other MUCH BIGGER issues. Imagine how much easier it becomes to perform a 51% attack with 95% of nodes gone, especially with BCH’s low hashrate. This is the very definition of centralized."
I wish I were a shill. I think I do a good enough job proving my point to get paid for it. Can you point me to where I can sign up to get paid for this?
Jfc dude.. weight is a measure of the force of gravity. Gravity is created by warping spacetime. A 1 gram butterfly weighs one gram because it only has enough matter to create that little force of gravity. Objects pull against the earth with a force equal to their weight. Ie the earth pulls you down, and you also push down against the earth. The question of gravity as it relates to the other forces (strong/weak electric etc) is a question of particle physics, not the earths shape lmao.
No one is talking about how miners compete or regulating them at all or miner centralization here. How is this even relevant to what I'm talking about with block size?

You're right, brain fart on my part.  Good write up.  
Yes, which is why second layer solutions as the ONLY solution is so dangerous. Most of us here don't give a fuck if there is LN support on the chain, we wont use it, others are free to. That shouldnt be the only way to do day to day tx though.
"You need an LN enabled wallet. You'd also wouldn't want to use it with real BTC because it's still development software so you might loose the funds, it's not production ready and as such is recommended you use it on testnet only.

"> It wasn't just a fradulant signature there was more to it than that.

There actually wasn't.

If you believe someone is Satoshi without the one piece of proof that would verifiably confirm it, then (I try not to do this, because I recognise people have different viewpoints) you're an idiot. Sorry. There's no other way of saying it.

The icing on the cake is that Craig Wright actually did provide a fraudulent signature. This proves that he's not opposed on principle to proof via signature... it does prove he's incapable of providing a genuine proof-by-signature. Take what you want from that. The obvious conclusion is that a fraudulent proof is proof of fraudulence.

The ""private proofs"" he did for Jon Matonis and Gavin aren't worth shit either. They were done on Craig's own machine (i.e. with a potentially modified signing/checking software that always ""validates"" what he wants it to) and it doesn't appear that Jon or Gavin were able to choose the message.

The only, only, only thing that could be viewed as proof that Craig is Satoshi is if he signs an arbitrary message (""I, Craig Stephen Wright, am Satoshi <latest block hash>"" would be my choice) with the private key to a known Satoshi address (pref block 1) and distributes it publicly.

If Craig Wright still keeps claiming to be Satoshi while failing to provide this proof, you can be fairly sure it's because he's not able to give it.

Why would he do it you ask? Because it's been an entirely rational choice, he's acquired a set of followers like yourself that are satisfied with ""you can't prove I'm not"" and ""trust me, I did a proof for Gavin/Jon... no you can't see it you just have to trust me/them"". He's now a major figure in the space, for better or for worse. It's literally impossible to prove Craig Wright isn't Satoshi, and he's the only one able to prove that he definitely is... which he won't do.

There's also the fact that his writing/communication style is completely different from Satoshi, and he appears to misunderstand a lot of the things Satoshi stood for. His tendency to try to horde blockchain patents just doesn't make sense if he were Satoshi. It's also likely that his attempt to ""become"" Satoshi is an attempt to bolster his claim on the patents.

> Logic is not bound to authority

Correct, but all Craig's claims to be Satoshi are based on trusting the authority of others (Jon/Gavin for example). And Craig's behaviour shouldn't be rewarded with social status. Many other people make similar arguments to him."
"So he's famous for saying that he was but proving he wasn't Satoshi Nakamoto

He's said some other stuff from time to time...which has been insightful but you should never lose track of the fact,  he said he was  Satoshi Nakamoto but didn't prove it 

Hence the comment 'full of shit'"
Wallets connect with peers, they don't connect with other wallets (they could with payment channels, but they don't when onchain transacting).

Why don't you take a second to think about why none of us like you 
I know it's quite a technical subject, maybe do a bit more research. It took me at least 6 months to really understand bitcoin. I would suggest not calling yourself an 'old school bitcoiner' until you understand it better.
Very impressive. Finally, a straight answer, thanks. I’m on vacation and dont have the time to dive deeper, but do you think thats a flat rate?
How so? What about what I said is untrue?
I think its you who misunderstand how a 51% attack works. Yes, you need hashpower to perform it, but not 51% of hashpower. You need 51% of hashpower + nodes. The idea of a 51% attack is that you forge transactions and own enough of the network to propagate the transactions as legitimate. This is why nodes are so important. They have equal footing as a miner in the network without high barrier to entry, meaning anyone can participate in the network (aka it’s decentralized)
Okaydude good luck explaining astrophysics without gravity ... I guess stars and wormholes are a conspiracy too 
I think you are intentionally misinterpreting my words and taking my view to the extreme. Ive never said every user should have a node, that is beyond absurd. I explicitly conceded most of the network is not home users. The point is not what the network is comprised of now, but instead, what direction it is heading. The internet is decentralized, but with the consolidation of power within very few ISPs, were now under threat of losing net neutrality. The exact same issue will happen to bitcoin and any crypto as the barrier to entry is raised such that ONLY enterprises can participate in operating. The powers that be will even move to limit participation, just as how the largest ISPs have moved to bar community ISPs.
Using corporate language is extremely dangerous when we're trying to perpetuate an anarchic technology. The enterprise is capitalism, which rapes your grandmother. Fuck the fucking enterprise. 
What is it about bch that allows 0-conf? Dont all cryptos have 0-conf? Its just an option for merchants, not a real solution.
"He's not Satoshi or he'd have provided a signature. He did provide a provably fraudulent one.

Satoshi would understand that only a verifiable signature is good enough to prove it. Satoshi wouldn't rely on ""I know I've given you a fraudulent signature but honestly I really am Satoshi"".

Anyone in here ignoring all this because csw says things that fit their agenda is unbelievably dishonest "
Is that really your position? That I don't have a basic understanding of the English language? ...
"I wasn't suggesting it should. Agree with your other points btw, was just trying to re-inforce the point that hardly anyone can understand people en masse without constructing elaborate simulations.

Yes. And I don't have any trouble finding 16GB USB sticks, you are complaining about a trivial amount of storage.
The only nodes that matter in Bitcoin are mining nodes. As we scale, mining nodes are the only ones that contribute to Nakamoto consensus. That's not a bad thing - in fact Satoshi himself saw this as the natural scaling evolution of Bitcoin.
You're arguing *against* a free market of mining (by restricting blocksize). Free markets lead to more decentralization.

"I think you misunderstand how a 51% attack works. 

First of all, they are commonly thought of as unprofitable, because they destroy the value of what you are essentially spending money to steal.

Secondly, they require hash power. Full nodes provide no hash power. They only verify. Any full node can determine the proper chain with the most proof of work, even if almost all of the other nodes try lying to it. "
Yes, just send an email to blockstream. They also have a slack where they plan raids, etc.
"My entire point is that that is insane. You cannot call gravity a force, it is too insane. You cannot have a force that selectively chooses to drag on some objects less than others... Then it's not a force then, it's some kind of magic. My whole point is that we have been fooled. Get that into your head. People are /scamming/ you.

If you were right then we should see feathers being dragged sideways next to a big mountain, because big mountains ""generate"" gravity.

Before gravity came along the scientific community agreed that it was an objects density relative to medium that dragged it down, and it being less dense than surrounding medium that made it rise. Assuming that objects generate ""gravity"" is insane. ""Gravity"" is an older literary tool, as in ""gravitate towards"" co-opted, introduced together with the ball and used to scam people, it has /nothing/ to do with the real world whatsoever."
"Well, I don't know what you tell you.

Bitcoin has been primarily in the enterprise domain for years now. There is just no other way to say that as a simple truth of the network now. Why do you believe the bulk of the network is still being operated by home users? Big enterprise and big miners are now the name of the game as a simple fact.

Bitcoin is still decentralized topology as a distributed network of independent data centers and professional miners, I'm not sure why you think just because every user is not a node this is not valid ""decentralization"" somehow. 

As said, if you want to operate a full node in support of the network please do so. What makes it decentralized is I *can* run same node as the big boys should I choose. *Enterprise* doesn't necessarily mean *giant data center* either, small business would be encouraged to run their own server infrastructure if they need to interact with the network. 

Nodes that don't help are the badly configured ones that leech, ie only download for example. Unless they are serving other nodes, your node is a burden on other nodes, not helping relay the chain."

"That is absolute bullshit.

Most mining nodes are running in enterprise data centers to which such bandwidth and storage is already trivial, and will only be more so in the future. 

Users were never supposed to be full nodes, which Satoshi said himself would be the case later on. It should not be a surprise that running enterprise server software at home could be difficult and not recommended generally."
"woah there cowboy, we all know that ***full nodes don't matter for decentralization*** and we can show this to ourselves very easy by thinking:

How is bitcoin decentralized when centralized banks can steal or freeze money? The answer is the miners in bitocin have power (miners are also full nodes), and they make bitcoin decentralized.

We can see how full ndoes don't really help the network in if they disagree they simply get left behind, they have no actual decentralization power.

At the same time, that study didn't take into account advancing hardware or software and had a poor basis,

the 4MB full block study that showd less than 5% lost nodes (which again don't contribute to decentralization) lost, but millions of more new users

You don't seriously believe that do you? That spending cash is wrong.
it's worth investigating...but it's depressing...
When the blocks started to become recently, the developers needed to make a small code change to increase the block size, to allow increased capacity on the network. The core developers refused to do this however and instead decided to rewrite the entire bitcoin protocol, which makes no sense, but they somehow managed to bamboozle enough people into thinking this was somehow a good idea. Go figure.
I'd imagine that by passing strings as data with tx, you could emulate a lot of ether-like end use cases with apps watching the BCH blockchain. A dumb and robust chain can still be applied very effectively, without needing SDK like features. Case in point, no need to over complicate a good tool, just get better at using it.

"RBF is not opt-in for the merchant. 

The merchant must check both the RBF flag *and* that the transaction fee is reasonable for a confirm-in-the-next-72-hours mining expectation.

The merchant is forced to perform these checks during the vital seconds of the over-the-counter trade when mere seconds dictate the difference between a great user experience and a mediocre one. Nuts! These added complications push a segwitcoin 0-conf way down the user experience list.

But your question is moot right? Segwitcoin is a settlement system now right? You don't want merchants using it, so why is a butchered me-too 0-conf even necessary? Merchants must first find customers willing to part with the trade-destroying transaction fees in any case.

Bitcoin Cash 0-conf is the fastest over the counter transaction short of a customer with correct change!

Your comment reminds me of [i'm a PC I'm a Mac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfv6Ah_MVJU) advertisement where segwit core just doesn’t get it but tries hard.

"
"Anything that lets a customer fuck over a merchant in any way should not be in Bitcoin, opt in or otherwise.

There was nothing wrong with pure 0-conf until Core dipshits decided there was a problem (because it clashed with their centralized corporate vision of Bitcoin). 

Someone selling coffee can be given a 99.9% guarantee their 0-conf will confirm in the very near future. Someone selling a house should probably give the network an hour for full confirmation before signing off. This is not hard, and something RBF fucks with for no reason and removes its utility as currency, as well as kills micro-transactions."
"It's one useless step more. Without full blocks RBF doesn't serve any purpose as every fee paying tx gets into the next block.

I think that those against RBF simply want buying with Bitcoin to be as frictionless and simple as possible. End user shouldn't even need to know what <insert a feature here> is."
Indeed, Cores shenanigans have painted them in a corner now pretty clearly, it is put or shut up time.
"Sidechains were announced in 2014. Turns out they couldn't even make them work without trust.

The reason they were hyped was that they were sold to people as ""hey, we can test new technologies on sidechains and then implement it on bitcoin is it works"". The problem is, people used to say the exact same thing about altcoins. Core has never once considered bringing in working tech from altcoins though.

I was around back then, no one, and I mean NO ONE thought that Core devs were going to oust Mike, Gavin and Jeff and then turn bitcoin into a settlement network."
Yes I also remember four years ago when sidechains were going to revolutionize Bitcoin.  How long do you think we should delay the original, very sound plan for these unicorns to appear?
You know, objectively speaking, you have to admit it: the concept of a magnet-powered perpetual motion machine is really cool. If they get things figured out with magnet power and friction, it could really take mechanics to a whole new level.

Hi.
"Second layer solutions are totally fine in theory, just not ever at the expense of scaling on-chain as far as possible too. Though with things like Graphene and 1gb blocks being tested, it may be a long time before we have to worry about it much. 

Id prefer Bitcoin just be a dumb, robust, and intently secure chain, I never really agreed with trying to ""Ethereumize"" it with more complexity than needed."

Absolutely it's an attack on Bitcoin.

What's wrong with opt in RBF? If you want to rely on zero conf, you can ask your customers not to use RBF transactions.
Imho it's too late for that. Currently I don't mind any current forks, because none has shown significantly how to scale like 1000x or even 10x. Whether Segwit nor bigger blocks will solve that. These are just skirmishes to me. 
Yup I loved Bitcoins vision when I first got into it in 2014.. then with all the fighting I turned to Ethereum. And now, Bitcoin Cash made me excited about Bitcoin again.. and like you said there are so many promising altcoins ready to take Bitcoin's place .. we just need an easier entry to them, but I don't think Core can keep this up.. they will be the death of themselves. 
"THIS!

While a lot of this is true, you have to admit that, objectively speaking, the concept of the lightning network is pretty damn clever. If it does manage to get built, the routing algorithm worked out, and people use it, it will really be next level peer to peer network finance transacting. 
"I don't get the Bitcoiners who value ethereum.

You claim to be old school but you don't even know what bitcoin is.  We don't need crypto to buy coffee.  We need it to store wealth outside of nation state and bank control.  Bitcoin is digital gold - just as it was intended.  If you kill Bitcoin original chain you kill all crypto forever.  Nobody is going to use your miner owned chain to buy McDonalds happy meals.  Surely you don't believe this crap.  You miners will be stuck mining something nobody wants or needs.  If you win we all lose.

"> zero-conf enabling normal retail use
 I dont think zero-conf is in the whitepaper?

Furthermore, zero-conf is just a miner mempool policy. Its not defined in the consensus rules. Therefore you could send a raw transaction directly to the miner and they could  manually add your transaction to the block even if it exists in the mempool. 

There is nothing preventing someone creating a bitcoin node that relays replaceable transactions to miners.

Some miners might not accept them to protect zero-conf - based on good will. Initially satoshi asked people not to use GPUs to make sure mining was decentralized for a while. But eventually people made asics because at the of day profitability drives miners decisions ( the security model of bitcoin is built around this assumption ).

So if some miners can make slightly more fee by accepting replaceable transactions then other miners eventually will. 

So eventually I think zero-conf will be broken, I think fully replaceable transactions ( zero-conf 100% broken ) will happen in bitcoin first. This doesn't really matter because bitcoin will become like gold ( a useless commodity which isn't used for day to day transactions )

Eventually i expect even bitcoin cash might have real-time secure payment layers to replace zero-conf. The difference is its optional to use these layers.  

"
Fortunately this is not how things work.
"I don't mind BCH, it was essentially free money and currently I hold more BCH than BTC (not in USD terms though), but I never understood what was the point of creating it. Seemed like just admitting defeat.  
What is the sentiment of BCH enthusiasts? Have you just given up on BTC? What happens in a hypothetical scenario: Blockstream runs out of JV $$$ and goes belly-up. Scaling through LN/sidechains is a failure and BTC goes back to on-chain scaling as originally intended. Will you still stick to BCH then, or go back to BTC?"
"Bitcoin's protocol allowed Segwit to happen. It doesn't matter if Bitcoin Cash's fork is more philosophically aligned with Bitcoin's original vision or not, because part of the vision that you support(ed) is that consensus within the system wins. If you're a ""big blocker"" your horse lost the race. Consensus won, and Segwit passed. You can call Bitcoin Cash ""the real Bitcoin"" if it makes you feel better, but the reality is that Bitcoin Cash's fork breaks from Bitcoin's consensus rules. Bitcoin Cash, while having history of the original chain, is not the original chain. Like the protestants straying from the corruption of the Catholic church, Bitcoin Cash is a protest against Bitcoin. "
When is everyone going to realise that all crypto development is practically an evolutionary process. Trying to implement carefully laid plans and then complaining when they don’t come off is futile. Bitcoin and crypto will get there, but the form it takes will result from a long period of refinement and adaptation based on the massive number of factors impinging on it. Stop being naive, and be patient.
Bitcoin Cash is not even close to being vision of Satoshi Nakamoto because it is missing most important part - censorship resistance because it is controlled by small group of people who you can be bribed, threatenes or coercees into doing what ehonever holds the largest stick wants.
"A lot of the criticism towards the Bitcoin chain is about the developers and whoever is behind them. Both 1x and 2x for that matter.

But when I look towards Bitcoin Cash developers and whoever is behind them I've come up a bit short. Who are they? Is there a face there at all?"
"I dont know anyone that started with Bitcoin back in 10/11 that say that BCASH is the „true“ vision or the real BTC.
Most of them are developers there consensus is to not make things bigger if there is a way to make it more efficiently.
Also thats my way of thinkin. Its easy to just adjust the blocksize and if the TX explodes it can be set up as fast as you can say Hello. The challange is to force the Development to make it more efficiently."
">I would agree with you, with one additional statement: Bitcoin Cash is not _against_ second layer solutions, if done properly.

Most of the problems with 2 layer are much easier to deal with if it is used for micro transactions..

2 layer are actually very complementary to onchain scaling.

Both will fit well on BCH."
"If you just leave your coins alone, you are not losing anything. Your btc address always holds all the forks if you don't do anything, zero risk.

However, you could try to **predict** the price of these forks. And trade them just like any alt-coin, sell the forks you think gonna go down. You could make more coin, or lose. 

My advice for you is to not take extra risk, and leave it the way it is. Wait until the dust settle, whatever fork emerge victorious, by that time there should be proper guidelines from this sub or rbitcoin on what to do."
I agree with your point of view. Bitcoin Cash is permissionless, so anyone can build whatever they want on it. We aren't against building things on top of Bitcoin, we're against having Bitcoin reengineered into a system primarily/exclusively intended to support L2.
Can someone ELI5 please? (In a non-biased way) I've been loosely following this but it's all got very confusing over the past 6 months. I have had BTC for several years now, should I be getting my BCH out of it and separating all of these currencies? As far as new investors and the public go, this massively disenfranchises bitcoin as a technology by making it unclear and hard to get into. The last thing a new currency needs is a steep learning curve.
Some exchanges are still using BCC for Bitcoin Cash. If it says it's Bitcoin Cash, it probably is, even if it says BCC.
It should be bitcoin cash, some exchanges just give it the bcc symbol instead of bch but its the same,

"~350-500MB. Also take in consideration that this is over 10 minutes. When a new block is announced you already have most of the TXs in your nodes memory pool. So it's mostly smth between 10-20MB ( new block + missing TXs )tops.

I downloaded a patch for Overwatch for 500mb in under 20 sec on a home connection... Again: on a home connection. I can have Visa levels TXs on my home connection. I don't think people fully understand what this means. It's easy to troll and spread FUD. But the technology to achieve Visa levels TXs is already here. We don't need LN or any L2. 

We can scale Bitcoin by scaling Bitcoin the way it was supposed to be from the beginning. By allowing more people on board and increasing throughput. 

The future really is bright for Bitcoin Cash.

There are many incentives for a blockchain-based business to keep a full, validated copy of the entire chain.

Any exchange, payment processor, analysis, wallet, etc provider will need one.

">Bitcoin not in wallets whose keys they exclusively control

This is wrong, payment channels are just 2 of 2 multi sig contracts that require each participant to sign every signal transaction in order to move funds. In the event that both parties don't agree to a funds transfer it's not an issue because initially in order to make the 2 of 2 payment channel they had to agree to a Hash Time Locked Contract and one of the rules of that contract is that if the 2 parties involved in the contract don't move funds after N number of days all funds are returned to the recipient.  

It's not like users don't control their funds within a payment channel, they in fact have 100% control over them. A payment hub nerve holds their funds, the users private keys do. LN just a bunch of crypto graphic proofs and in the event of any dispute or settlement the funds are broadcast onchain and the blockchain resolves the dispute by enforcing the contracts both involved parties sign and agreed to the resolution of.

 It'd help to understand how LN works instead of just spreading FUD."

Bitcoin Cash is Satoshi's original recipe. High performance, low fees, built for merchants and you as a real, hardened, secure, spending currency for day to day transactions. 

Cash is the one that was getting adopted and was working for 6 years until /r/bitcoin mods (of Bitcoin.org and bitcointalk.org), Bitcoin Core developers, Blockstream, and Dragon's Den, all of them nothing but cyber terrorist groups in the end, decided to ruin the original vision for corporate or personal gain. They killed adoption with bullshit like RBF.

Bitcoin SegWit with RBF is an abomination and an altcoin as far as I am concerned that miners got tricked into supporting. They can keep it, if Cash dies then I will be a full time Etherian.

">onchain scaling through planned blocksize increases

Immediate relative small scaling! And further scaling as needed based on the demand of the network. Eventually protocols and other systems build upon Bitcoin are a very good idea. If they go down they don't take the whole system down. Multiple different solutions can be implemented as long as Bitcoin itself will be usable directly for anybody that wants to do so. If you want to be a crypto bank or service provider or whatever it will always be a good idea to settle transactions internally first before on the blockchain. However sidechannels are not needed today and not needed in the near future. Why? Cause there hardly is much of bitcoin as a way of paying.  The blocksize should have updated to 2 or 4 mb like 4 years ago.

>no FUD surrounding mining requiring large data centers[3] at scale in the event of mass adoption 

What is the incentive for anybody to run a full node that does not mine? There is hardly one, to make the network more secure is bullshit. Only more mining power makes the network more secure. And mining is the most centralized aspect of bitcoin right now.  However as Bitcoins grows you will see all the large tech companies get in to bitcoin mining. This centralizing problem will fix itself. Next to that  it would be nice to have cryptocurrencies that use something like proof of stake. Satoshi never made a distinction between different types of nodes. No, a node was always a user, a replayer, a miner. That did not work out like that.  I am still waiting for a crypto that has an incentive for every user to use it on a daily basis. Build it on top of another app or something. Build a free netflix for porn but you pay for with your bandwith and some storage and some mining or something like that. The mainline DHT bittorent network has between 15 and 30 million nodes online, every single day cause people have an incentive for using. Make websites that can only visited by people that run a certain crypto software that will pay that website a microamount. Everybody mines and makes enough of these micro amounts to be able to visit these websites. These websites are now free, no mining in the pages. People need to mine when they use their computer or they can't visis these websites. No need for ads anymore. There are so many different concepts and ideas to think of now. We finally have a timestamp system that can not be manipulated anymore. I can proof I made a certain document with certain data at a certain time. This is amazing tech! 

>end-users using SPV (see section 8[4] ) to verify their transactions

Yeah, I never understood why the full block is always needed. It's impossible to start from block 2000 and build a longer chain from there. So at  certain point you can have clients that work off the last 10 GB of the block. Never understood why for ever every client needs the whole blockchain. If a client needs more data it can find a full note to get that data. 

>zero-conf[5] enabling normal retail use 

Yes very important so that every individual could use the bitcoin network for his own payment system. Was that not one of the thrilling aspects of Bitcoin? Affordable banking for the people that don't have good acces to the international banking system? High tech banking services freely available to everybody? Not necessarily free as in free beer but free as in nobody can ban you from the network or close your bitcoin address. 

>always-low fees 

This is  ESSENTIAL if you want to attract everyday normal users that want to use bitcoin for it's convenience over other payment systems. There should always be some room for free transactions, as a service of good will to everybody. Are we not trying to fix some of the things we hate about traditional banking? Or are we creating yet another tool for the banker that only they can acces?

how? technology is improving, right now we could have full 4MB blocks with only a few missing full nodes but maybe 10 million more users. Technology will only improve. There can't be any relation between scale with technology and change the fundamental design to have full or small bocks
"...so, by this reason we should support the miners attack on the current system?

Good logic never fails."
Where do you get the info saying at least 18 months away? As far as I can tell they have it working somewhat on testnet, and they also have a working mobile wallet. 
"The biggest reason SegWit as implemented is such a wart is because it was implemented via soft fork. It got rid of features like message signing and anyone can spend and is about 10x more long winded than it should of been to make it ""backwards compatible"" (but not really, because old versions don't understand what a Segwit tx is and see them as anyone can spend). I don't like Segwit, but the code would be so much cleaner as a hard fork."
"Where is the source code? ;)"
That doesn't define Bitcoin. Funny how you're luring newbies to believe your shit when you don't even know the basics. Would make it much better con if you built in it on at least something.

"/u/djbunnies is what you call a low effort troll. They put out a few words or a sentence and wait for someone to take the bait of ""responding"". It doesn't even matter what you say, the fact that you respond to the troll means that the troll won(in their mind).

Djbunnies, y u do dis? Well, beyond guessing they have nothing better to do or unresolved issues in their past, who knows. 

I just block trolls who have nothing of value to say. Most trolls I don't block, but the low effort trolls are annoying because they aren't intelligent enough to come up with a good troll. Low effort trolls are like the kid on the playground no one wants to be around because they are annoying on purpose, but when they are annoying it doesn't even make sense(because they are psychotic)."
As a Sith, I take offsense to that.
The less people that can participate in the network, the closer you get to centralization of network power. True or false?
I hate “we all know” statements. No, we dont all agree with your opinion so dont state it like fact. Miners and nodes have entirely different incentives. You say miners make bitcoin decentralized, yet it is huge companies with a massive amount of hashpower that typically end up actually mining blocks. A 51% attack becomes so easy without altruistic nodes. Youre GREATLY exaggerating the numbers, but no, I don’t agree that expanding the userbase at the expense of nodes is worth it. If the network is entirely miners, theyre going to use their power for profit. Thats why theyre mining in the first place, for profit. Nodes secure the network by having no financial incentive.
"> the 4MB full block study that showed less than 5% lost nodes 

I couldn't find it, but they later updated study to show that blocks could go even larger with a similar level of node loss.

"Got my first coin in 2010. I was with the bitcoin developers then and I'm with the bitcoin core developers now.

Satoshi was a developer. He was constantly going forward. LNs and other development was something he wanted.

Bitcoin cash is reactionary and it doesn't provide any features that other coins don't. If bitcoin cash had started with a new genesis block it would be dead in the water. 

If bitcoin cash had taken the opportunity to fix some of bitcoins real issues during the hard fork I would actually have a lot more respect for it. But instead people here are claiming that malleabillity is a feature (show me in the white paper where it argues for malleable transactions). "
"> Decentralized the development team¨

Yeah that seems to work great.

> Fixed the block size issue - the thing that's hung Bitcoin up since 2010

You haven't ""fixed"" anything. At best it's a postponement at worst it's a critical flaw

> Removed RBF so zero-conf works again

Zero conf doesn't work, If you like zero conf you don't actually need the blockchain at all

> Proven atomic swaps

Well that's nice. Finally bch has catched up to everyone else

> Three solutions on the table for malleability all better than the Segwit disaster

zero solutions in actual use, so their actual ""betterness"" is highly questionable"
How are you, personally, old school. Are you using a different account than your main? 
A 20%+ energy efficiency leads to an inevitable centralization of miners in china. There's nothing to 'believe', its basic economics.
"> zero-conf enabling normal retail use

That link didn't seem very conclusive. It seems like there's still a risk. Maybe someone could explain why this risk is insignificant?"
"What year did you get involved in crypto? 

You shouldn't make claims you can't back up. I find it hard to believe you can't find ANYTHING that goes back longer than this reddit account. No github? No bitcointalk? No irc? No posts on mailing lists? "
"With 1 MB blocks Bitcoin has a transaction capacity of about 3 transactions per second, while it could potentially be up to 7 tps from my understanding in real world conditions we see 3. So for ever 1 MB of blocks (assuming all non Segwit transactions) you get 3 tps. 

As for [Visa it's capable of transacting 24,000 tps](https://usa.visa.com/run-your-business/small-business-tools/retail.html) However [this other source of theirs says 56,000 at peak](https://usa.visa.com/dam/VCOM/download/corporate/media/visa-fact-sheet-Jun2015.pdf) 

Anyhow looking at that first source we can see that they average 150 million per day on Visa. That works out to be 1736 tps. Now 1736/3=578. So that's 578 MB blocks that would be needed. Now that doesn't account of the number of transactions handled on competing systems as well like MasterCard and that this number consistently grows along with the worlds population and that Visa would see higher TPS if it wasn't cost prohibitive to do things like micro transactions using them.

Anyhow everyone shouldn't be broadcasting the transaction of every cup of coffee they buy to the world to forever be ingrained in history on the blockchian. That's just bloat. Realistically most transactions would be done offchain through means that are tied to the security of the blockchain, effectively allowing us only to save the net sum of transaction on chain. This way we can handle much smaller blocks."
You heard wrong.
That's the same argument for staying at 1mb from my understanding. 
[deleted]
But merchant adoption fell this year because of blocks being full, tx being slow and fees rising, so we're obviously way behind supply and demand.
Sorry, but that sounds reasonable to you?. 
u/xmodulus says it's in gigabytes, which is quite a disparity. Any numbers or evidence behind the figure?
Why, what will happen? 
"Bitcoin cash is nowhere near the original plan.
Was the EDA algo in the original specs? ...I didn't think so.
Did the original specs mention highly inconsistent block times? ...I didn't think so.
Not to mention shady developers and shady miners that game the system.
It's a crypto parody.

"where was the original meet up forum that was started before actual mining software was released?

I'm a bit out of the loop so a genuine question: is the lightning network not already implemented on Litecoin? I had been under the impression it was a working technology already.
How so? When Bitcoin Cash split it took a new ticker(s), replay protection, and EDA. Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin Cash why try to change it now? If Bitcoin Cash is better then it will win...
"The real bitcoin is all of these things. Just because the bitcoin cash people cannot play well with others and choose to take their ball and leave whenever things do not happen the way they want does not make it ""the real bitcoin"". "
Yes indeed, exciting times when we see real dev work like that happening. As said both chains are bringing the goods to the table, which is awesome for users all around to fill all of their financial needs.
"Yeah no problem

Tend to agree. This is similar to the mess the US has got into by putting the constitution on a pedestal 
"I think you are confusing some sort of religious attachment when people just want what they signed up for.

Would that upset you?"
Yeah, why follow Satoshi's words anymore? I mean, he may have titled his Bitcoin whitepaper 'A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System' but that's such a lame goal in retrospect. *Obviously* what the world *really* needs today is a hub-to-hub electronic settlement system. Satoshi's vision is hopelessly outdated. As for 'cash'… what's wrong with USD, amirite??
"The road is unknown, but the destination doesn't change.  

The issue is that layer2 solutions is not the same as p2p cash that we signed up for, regardless of the merits of the code. "

We don't. Please point out the errors Satoshi made and how they are relevant here and I promise we will listen.  But I don't think you have a better plan than what's written in the links in op."
"I do both. I spend bitcoins from my spending account, but hold on my bitcoin savings account.

Even with high fees, the purchases I have made was extremely cheap if I count it by the FIAT I purchased it with - and given that it was purchased *from* my spending account, *for* spending, I consider that pretty neat. Even if it would be neater with lower fees. Incidentally, I don't really care if my books/random stuff purchases from amazon (future use) or my ""coffee cup spendings"" are recorded on a public ledger. Nevertheless, the bitcoin settlements *are* of course eventually recorded on the blockchain.

It's a little bit like free person-to-person-spendings on coinbase and other exchanges, except that it's governed by bitcoin smart contracts instead of a companys whims."
takeaway.com accepts bitcoin SegWit. I'm not sure about bitcoin cash though.
I still have my old mycellium wallet from 2014...I spent 2BTC that year on pints of beer @ $9AUD a pop (that's $150AUD in today's money and yes deflationary money is hard to understand :P)
That would be the same developer as the Bitcoin chain then, so everything is good then?

">The whitepaper does in fact discuss zero-confirmation transactions.

I think you need to read the white paper again....
https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf
Here's the only reference I found to transactions:
>He can't check the transaction for himself, but by linking it to a place in the chain, he can see that a network node has accepted it, and blocks added after it further confirm the network has accepted it.

>New transaction broadcasts do not necessarily need to reach all nodes. As long as they reach
many nodes, they will get into a block before long. 

I am NOT saying RBF, or OPT-IN RBF is good, all I am saying is sometime in the future zero-conf will be broken. Because zero-conf rules are not apart of bitcoin consensus rules, therefore it can get violated with no consequence to the profitability of miners. Therefore there is no incentive other than good will of mining pools to keep supporting zero-conf for better adoption.

Bitcoin might just end up be a cautionary tale to its successors, and that’s fine with me as far as the ideology underpinning cryptocurrency goes. Everyone is getting way too tribal about bitcoin, and most pretend it’s because a greater good is at stake. In reality, most people just want money, and want holdings in whichever implementation is successful. 
What kind of moron uses bitcoin to send that much money so that the fee would be that unreasonable. 
Don’t think So. I have researched both coins independently and Bitcoin is still only one which is censorship resistant.
Sold all my bCash. If you started with a genesis Block...bCash would be dead. Forking is the only way you can scam people
