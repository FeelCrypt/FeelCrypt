"I didn't say anything about communism.  No-one is coming to confiscate your property or force you to work for the government or to buy things from them.

The freedom you imagine will never occur on Earth.  We must look after the place as well as the vulnerable.  Your views on what constitutes freedom only result in the exploitation of others for personal gain."

Satoshi Nakamoto was not a communist either as you seem to think. Freedom is not freedom if the government still controls the economy. You should probably tell the liberals that, so they stop trying to turn the world into one big communist regime. 
The fact is, free speech doesn't apply to Google or Facebook or Apple or Microsoft or Amazon or Reddit. They can do whatever they want with their private, opt-in platforms. If you create your own platform, you are free to do whatever you want with it.
Fuck Roger Ver. When I see him I’ll punch him in the face 
Wow but that actually makes sense. I already got my pitchfork and everything. 
I'm free to stick my foot up the ass of any commie conning for my gun!
He is a known scammer so why so mad bcashers? 
Oh wow Youtube is in on it too! /s
">maybe they also track ICO tokens and whatnot? Those would probably be taxed differently, maybe with the 25%?

"> If the author of the project claims it to be his project

The sentence is already presupposing that he is the author of the project.

> Roger claims BCASH is his. Now you want BCASH the software project to call Roger its owner? What?? What is the total factual proof you'd be satisfied with? I've presented you evidence that BCASH is RV's project -- Roger's own words, and you've not provided any counter to that, and you do not believe Roger here. Lol.

> But hey, I'll gladly waste our time here. A great example.

After so many comments, what you affirmed are two things, that RV is the representative of BCH and that RV said that BCH is his project. You have only presented evidence of the latter, but I was interested in the former, as I said, I do not care what RV said.

Let's see if I can be clearer because it seems you do not understand me. That someone says he is the representative of something does not make it true. You asserted he is the representative but you only have evidence of what he said, not what it is. If I say that I am the representative of BTC, you would not go around saying that this is true, but you would say that I said that, they are two different things."
"If the author of the project claims it to be his project.. Uhh, it can't go other way, can it? What sort of evidence are you looking for here?

Roger claims BCASH is his. Now you want BCASH the software project to call Roger its owner? What?? What is the total factual proof you'd be satisfied with?

Alright I retract my statement that he didn't delete any posts but instead had his posts removed by mods. Both things may well have happened and I overlooked that. My apologies.
Most people would never have seen it if I did that, but you tell yourself whatever you need to. :)
"The part about false accusations is /u/Korberos accusing me here and elsewhere of helping someone spread lies, which I did not do. In fact he accuses a lot of people in this thread with his repetitive spammy message. Rather than focus on the new evidence and articulating the point about new evidence he is obnoxiously making false accusations towards commenters here because he suspects a conspiracy, which ironically means he is committing the same crime he is accusing the OP of via a false accusation. This I keep saying and yet you do not seem to comprehend.

No, not everything is a lie about this incident either. The initial interaction did in fact happen. It's the reason I specifically chose to post in response. I had no reason to believe OP was a liar and no particular loyalty or reason to help them spread a lie. "
"> Yep. So you're calling Roger Ver a liar?

I did not watch the video, I do not care what RV said.

> In that interview Roger Ver says that Bitcoin Cash is his project.

That is evidence that RV said something, not that he is the representative of BCH, which is your claim."

"We know that half the people are here because they were kicked off for something ridiculous and that's who you cast your lot with.

+1 to this. This many posts makes me think u/Korberos has an agenda. Like if he can poke holes in this one story that proves all the claims from credible users like u/jessquit and u/JustSomeBadAdvice that they were banned capriciously by rBitcoin's draconian censorship regime are suspect too. Complete fucking non-sequitur.
"> He's saying it's his project, why do you not believe him?

As I said, I do not care what he says. The statement that matters is not that he says he is the representative, but that he IS the representative. I thought you had evidence of that but apparently not."
">That is evidence that RV said something, not that he is the representative of BCH, which is your claim.

Roger claims to be representative of BCH. Either he is, or he lies. I see no reason for him to lie about that. Do you?

He's saying it's his project, why do you not believe him?"
Whatever. One week ago your side was cheering that BU nodes were dropping like stones where in reality coin dance didn't take into account the new network magic thing. Fact is, currently Bitcoin is more centralized with its wallet monoculture.
"> I can answer to your second question directly, too: If you say that something is your project, then you're the representative of it. Unless of course if you're lying, which simply makes you a liar and a representative of liars.

If I say that I am the representative of something then I am the representative of that, but if I am not and in reality I am lying then I am not, good logic...

Anyone can say that he is the representative of something, that does not make it true. I do not know if RV lied or you're misunderstanding, I do not care, what matters is that you affirmed something and you have no evidence of that."
Putting words in my mouth. You did good making the comment that you  did, you did less good spamming it 30 times or whatever it's been. Have you ever seen another user copy and paste the same comment 30 times in a thread or however many times you have? This isn't even that important a reveal, and most people in this thread seem to be on your side but you're still tirelessly chasing shadows. Relax.
I do not care about that. Are you going to answer my question?
So you don't believe Roger when he states Bcash is his project? Or in other words, you're stating Roger is a liar. Why would he lie about this?
At the time I started posting, no one was on my side. It's very clear that my efforts changed the tide if you've seen both the before and after, which you apparently haven't.
lol... because that sudden influx of 400 BU nodes was totally natural growth. /s
"Ohh, so this is about the sources, not about my logic.

Well, one of the interviews where he calls Bcash as ""my project"": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJT2CbfHTpo"

You earned it
"That seems like an unnecessary jab when there are more straightforward criticisms to levy. 

What's offensive to me is people thinking they own the branding behind the name Bitcoin and that it entitles them to attack and ridicule others for dissenting and initiating a fork. There are reasons why the fork happened which Bitcoin Core supporters must come to terms with. Everyone is at liberty to fork.

It's a self fulfilling prophecy if you make observations that people are agitated while in turn facilitating that agitation through mockery or the circular logic of attacking the fact that there is antipathy towards a subreddit that has troubling levels of censorship and bans which is being voiced. The voicing of criticisms is just that, and while there is a legitimate concern with avoiding drama there's also a troubling number of people who want to pretend there aren't problems or don't want to discuss them. There is a divide. You don't have to state the obvious fact that there is conflict. Water is wet. Most of the hostile comments I've seen don't elevate the conversation beyond these obvious facts or opinions about legitimate authority and other nonsense."
Likewise :)

You said it would be unfair to call him a representative on that basis if it was not his project. What is your evidence? If it's just what he said, then I repeat my question: if I say that BTC is my project then IS my project and I am the representative?
The miners are free to accept or reject Bitcoin ABC or Bitcoin Unlimited's proposals. Something Nakamoto Consensus, big boy

He did, in a way, but it's not a new thing that people get randomly banned on rnorthkorea for comments that simply express a disagreement in opinion, or get banned for no reason at all for having commented on another sub. reddit knows all this, if they just cared to have a look, they could find plenty of that, even in OPs case. They just don't have a look.

"My agenda is to point out liars. OP was an obvious one.

It strikes me as laughable and not at all unexpected that you would be more concerned with my agenda than OP for lying in the first place."
doesnt really matter for my point unless bitcoin core was 100%... but by all means, call it bcore if you like
">  so I am just calling out that it's fair to call Roger representative of that project.

That is meaningless. It's like calling out that Greg Maxwell is a representative of the Core project. Also meaningless. 

What you're trying to do is suggest that Bitcoin Cash (not bcash) is controlled by Roger which is demonstrably false and dishonest. "
"Greg hasn't called Core his project, has he? Anyway, this is not about whether ""representative of X"" is meaningless or not in your opinion. Roger states that Bitcoin Cash is his project and OP states that by no means should Roger ever be called representative of Bitcoin Cash. That does not make sense.

So, Roger has stated that Bcash is his project. What's so difficult about this? Of course he represents his own project, right? Who cares if that's meaningless -- it's not the point.

Read the post by OP and see why I mentioned the whole ""representive of Bcash"" thing at all.

>What you're trying to do is suggest that Bitcoin Cash (not bcash) is controlled by Roger which is demonstrably false and dishonest.

I have no idea about who controls Bcash (or Bitcoin Cash, whatever). This is not about that. This is about Roger stating that Bitcoin Cash is HIS PROJECT and that obviously he can be fairly called REPRESENTATIVE of HIS project, then.

Okay, so you call Roger being representative of Bitcoin Cash as demonstrably false and dishonest, which directly contradicts Roger's own words about it being his project (we assume that his project = his control = he being the representative?) You say it's ""demonstrably false and dishonest"", so in other words, Roger is a liar in your opinion?"
Lmao and taking the web domain bitcoin.com and the Twitter @bitcoin isn't? Do as I say not as I do I suppose..
You can call Bitcoin Core BCore all you want... doesn't bug me.  Bitcoin is different then the software that the network runs on tho.
">Roger didn't even support Bitcoin Cash when it came out. It was only after segwit2x failed did he change his support.

This is a lie."
Good bot
No, I don't, of course not. But he opened himself to attacks when he said a falsehood. Now they can point to his msgs in r/bitcoin and simply say they didn't break any reddit rules.
"> My last comment on r/Bitcoin was 18 days ago.

[Here's proof that you're lying, so that everyone can see.](https://ceddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/83291g/)"
Is this proven? Can someone examine this and peer review it? Nothing coming from these liars should be trusted at first sight. And not to mention someone who's got the name 'bcash pill' on twitter obviously...
"Incredible, but true. You insane censor. Are the mods supposed to call the users of this sub ""stupid"", because that's like borderline harassment, imho."
im blocked
It's not my twitter (It's StopAndDecrypt's), but thank you for the call-out.
So you have been banned from reddit by the admins for repeated harrasment? That's funny because I reported you for personally harassing me, yesterday.
"So you want to show them how, when confronted with evidence that the OP was lying, everyone changed their tune? 

This kind of censorship from rBitcoin is believable. Many people have been banned from rBitcoin simply for saying they think bigger blocks is a good idea. In this case the OP lied and we called him out on it. Not sure what you're showing people."
"Conflating an individual's actions with all people who post on a given subreddit is dishonest.

You can speak your mind without being censored on quality subreddits."
What in the actual fuck? Did you just make that up or you thought about it for a while and said, yeah this is a good lie? Cause this is the stupidest story I’ve heard yet. 
It would be awesome if we could get reddit to close r/bitcoin.

Still, /u/Korberos ought to consider an apology for falsely accusing several posters here of helping to spread lies. I am also in the group of people who posted here but did not upvote the OP's thread.
I am legitimately impressed that I wasn't down-voted, the way I usually am in this sub when I bring up the truth in matters like this.
r\bitcoin mods are known to edit threads in order to portray events differently.  They and their followers routinely lie about the Bitcoin Cash project, especially the ones that come to this sub.  Sorry bro.  that bridge is burned.  I don't think very highly of them, I don't read their garbage anymore, and I certainly don't believe a word you or they say.
Of course if it indeed wasn't his project, it would be unfair to call him a representative of it on that basis. Roger stated that it *is* his project. Let's assume he knows what are his projects and what are not.
">It's funny because if you know your history Roger didn't even support Bitcoin Cash when it came out. It was only after segwit2x failed did he change his support.

Who cares what he allegedly supported or didn't. What I said is that Roger has stated that Bitcoin Cash (bcash) is his project, so I am just calling out that it's fair to call Roger representative of that project. "
"If so many people weren't gung-ho to believe these lies, and if the lie hadn't been posted in the first place, I wouldn't be here.

It’s a lie.

2: I walked away.

3: They commented in r/bitcoin after my convo with them.

Serious kudos for being the only person in this thread to apologize. Good on you, man.
"I heard that bitcoinxio once chased a user down and worked with reddit admins to have them banned from the entire site because they said ""die thief"" to someone who was bragging about a succesfull bitcoin theft that they had pulled off, in this sub. But no, there are no radical censors here. "
"> Of course if it indeed wasn't his project, it would be unfair to call him a representative of it on that basis.

So what do you rely on to say that it is indeed his project?"
But I thought BCash was also an abbreviation?  And since you’re using an abbreviation for Bitcoin Cash for the chain/network anyway, you might as well use the shorter one.
Saving this post just to show everyone in the future how corrupt THIS sub is.
It isn't. I saw the events play out with my own eyes. Roger Ver continued his support of Segwit2x--which would have killed Bitcoin Cash and kept the community united had it succeeded--right up until it was cancelled at which point he announced he would shift his support to Bitcoin Cash. This isn't rBitcoin dude. Falsehoods like this don't get a free pass just because you've censored and banned everyone who disagrees. Provide counter-evidence or go back to your safe-space on rBitcoin.

"The claims check out. ~~u/StopAndDecrypt lies a few times in his response though. OP didn't ""delete"" his posts, mods removed them. As a mod StopAndDecrypt would have been fully aware of that, but chose to lie about it to further his case.~~ He also lies in claiming Roger Ver was a BCH guy before Segwit2x fell through. 

One user lying about the reasons he was banned from rBitcoin doesn't mean that rBitcoin only bans people for good reasons. I think the rBitcoin people posting in this thread are trying to advance that conclusion but it's a non sequitur."
No not true at all. 
You’re not owed my time.
"Of course I won't apologise for calling out such a triple-change-of-subject.
