Bitcoin was so great under Gavin. 
Gavin was duped into thinking G-Max, Adam, and the other dipshits were good-willed people. Seems like he has probably learned a very valuable life lesson about what to expect from certain types of people, finally, at around the ripe old age of 50-something. 
I also echo /u/BejingBitcoins sentiment. I assure you, I am no paid shill. 
Hello religious nut! 
Word
Hopefully we can make for all that lost time in the near future :)
"I chalked up $2M in losses due to Blockstream Core, I can only imagine how much loss Circle, Fiver, Bitcoin.com and many others have suffered.

Worst than that, is all of the abuse towards good people. This has a psychological cost and while this is business, nobody deserves to be abused at work. Your health is priceless."
[deleted]
Not to mention that the one and only company responsible for causing that massive cost will be taking on exactly none of it.
"Who are you to say how many altcoins we should have?

Crypto currency will be adding ranks of greater-fools for decades to come. 

There will always be alts because the cost of spinning up a new scam is near zero while human greed remains high as it always will. 


There are 7 billion people yet to buy a crypto so yeah, there will probably be more and more alts - but bitcoin remains the only coin of actual value."
"Glad to see some understanding in that post.

The Devs arnt dictating anything, and they cant. All they are saying is that THEY arnt going to work on a presumably bad idea. The network can choose to signal for a less-safe implementation if thats what the market truly wants. 

So far the market doesnt want to risk loosing money. And the tx fees are the extent to which the market will bear. We will see how much that is in time.

But it just so happens that the great majority of competent people happen to code for the Bitcoin Core client.

Maybe because it is also the best & most tested  implementation out there right now? No need to do extra tedious work on smaller projects right? I mean, who wants to clean up for someone else?

Im not calling the other clients devs idiots, but there are really only a handful of people who REALLY understand how to code for bitcoin. And they mostly work on Core. *Shrug*"
What do you mean? He worked on/started XT then abandoned it, joined Classic over Unlimited then abandoned Classic. Now he is suggesting people use BitcoinUnlimited yet he himself has not contributed to it. At least with him on board, errors such as the one that caused the recent accidental fork might have been caught before going into production. I'm just curious why he hasn't worked on this fork attempt.
"""Team Bitcoin"" means doing nothing productive and attacking Bitcoin, calling it broken, attacking contributors to it, being a banner-name consultant to competing systems?

If so, I'm proud to not be on it."
"> Could say the exact same thing about you with one word replaced.

You mean to write welcome to sabotage, perhaps?"
So you are you saying Gavin invented Willie bot?
"> We've been here all along.

Lurking in the shadows."
You're pretty uninformed about the past. We've been here all along.
This so bad, I was going to write this before seeing your comment. The moment Gavin handed the keys to the kingdom to the dungeon troll the whole kingdom when to hell.
Hello paid employee/shill of Rodger!
Compared to Gavin's breath of fresh air G-Max is like an acid rain cloud.
"That kinda fails to take into account the many blocks being mined by BU without incident doesn't it?

Even if we pretend like BU was only alive for the past 1000 blocks. If you assume theres an approximately equal chance of finding a correct hash for an invalid block as a valid block (by size) then you would have to say this bug has reduced the effectiveness of BU from 100% to 196/197~99.5%

So its more like you work for 2 months and get paid at some rate and its all good and then you realize that the manager is mandating you waste .5% of your time and not paying you for it.

either way, not 12k"
Actually what happened was like the manager promising a certain amount of pay based on expected share but then a piece of equipment malfunctioned. Expected share didn't change and the workers still got the same pay. 
that's one way to spin it 
I know it's so ridiculous.  Another example of the worst centralization being the blockstream devs, not the miners
"-

I would say the damage that has been made over the years is higher than one orphaned block: 

-

- Merchants lost confidence
- Users lost confidence 
- Current/Prospective startups lost confidence
- alienating and driving developers to altcoins
- alienating, ridiculing and threatening miners

-

Again, I think the costs and the damage is more than $12K. The user, business, developer and mining community has to act together. Core cannot hide and code in their ivory tower detached from these communities. Otherwise, these communities select alternatives, as it happens with BU. 

-


"
Not to mention the additional support load that is externalized to all bitcoin companies having to deal with users sending support emails asking why their transactions have not confirmed.
"it went up in value and it was cheap, user friendly. Now, in order to avoid the high congestion fees, I have to go through many steps to send a transaction with electrum:

1. disabling ""use dynamic fees""
2. setting transaction fee per kb to 0.0001 
3. entering amount - clicking send
4. copying my transaction ID
5. pasting my transaction ID into the VIABTC accelerator - captcha - submit

Under Gavin management, I had 1 step:
1. enter amount - click send
"
">which has not happened.

What? Are you blind? Why do you think we still, after all these years, have all these altcoins hanging around? Instead of hundreds we should have maybe a few dozen at most. Imo, it's all because people see a problem with core dev and their willingness to exploit the protocol for their own ends. "
"> Who is anyone to say what is excessive but the market - who's voice will take the form of a significant migration to other coins - which has not happened.

That's what I'm saying. Let the market decide what is an excessively large or small blocksize. Devs shouldn't even attempt to dictate such a thing."
"he gave a few reasons, you could call it a bit of a personality clash. Gavin endorsed Classic for Miners and BU for nodes. 

who knows what the future holds.  "
now you love him?
Hahaha, you're hilarious!  You ever consider getting into comedy?
Not taking any decisions which was a good thing considering your terrible lack of leadership and judgement. 
good thing he has the rest of us to confirm his findings.  stop trying to rewrite history Greg.
"Yeah, y'know, ignoring the endless thousands of lines that gavin has written already.

And ignoring the fact that you literally write heavily downvoted posts to reddit 1-5 times an hour. I don't even know how you have time for anything else."
Such a badass. Your independency, lack of respect for authoritys and free speech directly from your heart inspire pepole all over the world, hemorroid.
If it has all of those things then the price could go even higher.
I've been around for many years now and know exactly what Gavin is like. Now shoo troll http://www.lake-link.com/images/forumPhotos/trollrepellent.jpg
I already knew the answer to my question. Never.
"You're too trusting. Just say ""link please "". "
"Many people might think that a price in the range of 100'000 USD/BTC by 2020 is unrealistic - but actually, it is quite realistic, with almost no change to the existing software:

> 1 BTC = 64'000 USD would be > $1 trillion market cap - versus $7 trillion market cap for gold, and $82 trillion of ""money"" in the world. Could ""pure"" Bitcoin get there without SegWit, Lightning, or Bitcoin Unlimited? Metcalfe's Law suggests that 8MB blocks could support a price of 1 BTC = 64'000 USD

https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5lzez2/1_btc_64_000_usd_would_be_1_trillion_market_cap/

---

If the price went up 3.25x per year, we would hit 100'000 USD/BTC in 4 years!

Here's the formula which calculates this rate (3.25x per year) which would be necessary to get us from 900 USD/BTC to 100'000 USD/BTC in 4 years:

  (100000/900)^0.25 = 3.25

This would give a market cap of about 1.5 trillion for Bitcoin. 

This would actually be less than 2% of the ""money"" currently sloshing around the world - so it would be quite feasible, given the advantages of Bitcoin over so many other currencies and asset classes.

It's very exciting to think that basically all we need to get there is bigger blocks (ie, market-based blocks like what BU gives us - not centrally-planned blocks from Blockstream/Core).

And remember: a bitcoin price means that _miners would make lots of money from the coinbase subsidy / reward itself_ - so miners could make much more money, and users could spend much lower fees.

This is how Satoshi planned for Bitcoin to grow.

And this is how Bitcoin will continue to grow - once we get it back from the stranglehold of Blockstream/Core.
"
$100K by 2020? I'll take an efficient Bitcoin network with low-fees, fast confirmation times and worldwide acceptance please!
Not to mention that they made an agreement with miners on scaling, then broke it.
i meant coding
Gavin has repeatedly shown to be a passive aggressive outsider whose incompetence has been the catalyst to his own exit from Bitcoin development. He acts like he is a former US president criticizing the newly elected. Except, in this analogy Gavin resigned because he couldn't handle the job of the president of the most powerful country in the world. Oh, and possibly he has PTSD from the Craig Wright Satoshi shitshow which resulted in his extreme bamboozlement. 
PLUS ONE
Wow you're such a badass for defying your gurus like that! Don't you fear their wrath? 
Depending on how badly Soros and his friends try to hurt Trump's chances of reelection (they are very likely to cause one of the biggest market crashes in history and even could go as far as completely decimating the USD) bitcoin could reach a stable $100K in today's dollar value by 2020.
Not to mention that they completely deny this fact and the clear conflict of interest therein by lying repeatedly and manipulating people.
/u/memorydealers said it was just an orphan but it was a fork. You can read more about it in this thread https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/5qwtr2/bitcoincom_loses_132btc_trying_to_fork_the/
"If this were true he would stop inserting himself back into it.
> maybe he's just tired of the debate. 

"
"> I have never said Bitcoin is broken.

switch to a coin that scales.

> Part of the broken culture is an inability to react maturely to criticism, or to acknowledge that reasonable people can disagree about priorities.

Stop being such a negative nelly. If you spent more time working on solutions......,

Your constant negativity is not helping make progress, which is sad because there is awesome progress being made all the time by [myself] and Pieter and other contributors.



"
hard at work trying to change Bitcoin, i see.
"This is the CTO of Blockstream; still has nothing better to do than shitting on the community. "
"Such visionary CTO ;)"
"I have never said Bitcoin is broken.

I will continue to be critical of the Core implementation's priorities and culture since I stepped down as long as I think those priorities and culture are harmful to Bitcoin.

Part of the broken culture is an inability to react maturely to criticism, or to acknowledge that reasonable people can disagree about priorities."
maybe he's just tired of the debate.  as well, BU is difficult to understand as it relies on free market mechanics which are not always apparent.  most of his original fears centered around the sigops problem but BU has since addressed it in it's own secure manner.  his latest sentiment seems to have improved markedly towards BU.
"> recent accidental fork

far from it it was an orphaned block."
"Go back to /r/bitcoin gross being. Go back to your ""alternative facts"""
See? He likes BU : https://twitter.com/gavinandresen/status/826168800647270408
Not to mention that said company also stands to profit from transactions that don't take place on the blockchain they are limiting.
Bitcoin will eat it all up, it's on the 2140 plan.
I actually disagree with Greg and Luke et all from time to time *and speak out about it* when have you ever disagreed and said it out loud?
Yes, it is very unfortunate, he was trying to improve things by removing reliance on himself as 'the leader' but he was better than all of those he let replace him. 
"Yeah man, in any other tech business, a CTO that talks shit on reddit all day would have been fired because of the media blowback. Imagine if Apple's CTO just went around raging at nerds online.

But the so-called ""bitcoin media"" is about as impartial as kim jong un. "
Such a class act Gavin. Very refreshing change after reading Gregs non-stop childish posting. 
"> All they are saying is that THEY arnt going to work on a presumably bad idea.

What a complete lie. They openly advocate for banning all positive conversation about any of the competing clients on the largest bitcoin forums in the world. And if you think people like Luke-jr are competent when it comes to coding bitcoin then I'm glad he is on your side. Also, there are thousands of people around the world who are extremely skilled at programming and cryptography who could and would be developing for clients, sidechains, and other things if bitcoin proved to be more successful and if Blockstream and Core stopped trying to ban competitors being allowed to speak on the biggest platforms. It is a terrible myth that ""only a handful"" are out there. Not true. Only a handful have decided to dedicate time to bitcoin because thus far it is still either seen as a joke or not seen at all by most of the world. Raise the blocksize limit, improve service and capacity, watch the marketcap explode upward, and suddenly that ""handful"" will become much larger overnight."
so u're one of the flies on Gavin's shit. Get a life. 
I'm sure he meant BS/Core. 
Almost none of them suffered any loss since they earn a share which disregards that block. It was mostly Roger who ate it and I can surmise that he was actually quite happy to do so if it weren't for the bad PR which BS/Core and their shills tried so desperately to capitalize on yesterday.
"They worked for it.

Kinda like working for a company for two weeks and then the manager saying they messed up payroll and won't pay you for your work."
"Still I'm very sorry bitcoin.com miners.

This reminds me when I mined at BTCguild and there was a fork my pool lost lots of blocks. And I had to eat the cost because of a bug.

The upside is it all works out in the wash with a difficulty adjustment everything being equal.  "
i'm glad i was still solo mining back then.
"Who is Gavin to say what is excessive? Who is anyone to say what is excessive but the market - who's voice will take the form of a significant migration to other coins - which has not happened.

And when a significant migration happens - bitcoins tx fees will go down just like they wanted.

Gavin has lost all credibility and this is a perfect example why. What a dunce"
Now just imagine if segwit activated and something went wrong.  It wouldn't be 12k in miner fees but who knows how much in anyone can spend user funds.
They won't let him.  They revoked his dev keys
Gaaaaaa Viiiiin!

Gavin is killing it on twitter and he is right!
This
"Actually, the situation is more like:

""if i tell you that i'll give you 12k, if you clean my yard and then, after you clean my yard, say, actually nvm.

did you lose 12k?""

I think the answer is definitely yes, in that situation (though slightly less in this, if my understanding is correct, as the change in code would have changed the outcome of how many blocks they confirmed (Disclaimer, I don't know if that's true or not))."
"Not to mention the sales that merchants have lost when random backlogs occur and transactions get booted out of the mempool or are delayed for several days during which time the customer says ""screw this"" and cancels to get a refund. "
"Gavin continues to do nothing but tiresome crapposting: Rbtc cheers.
"
This guy really can't sink any lower. No wonder MIT stopped paying him.
Thank you Gavin! I always appreciate hearing your perspective.
Is he in XT or Classic now?
It went up in value what, 100 or 1000x during that time? 
Seriously, I miss the Gavin-run community.  Everybody loved eachother
Why is BitcoinUnlimited the only fork software /u/gavinandresen hasn't worked on? 
not even the fees that are the problem yet, but the disruption over last year caused by capacity issues to new users, business etc.
therein lies the financial confliction
What is an excessive fee? How do I know when I see it? What fee structure should I compare Bitcoin fees too? What value store/payment network has a comparable structure to the Bitcoin network and same security model that I can use as a reference?
"Fees so ""excessive"" they happily pay them. So excessive, bitcoin usage and price are plummeting. "
"I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

LOL, you just come here to get down-voted but hey each to there own.

Psychopath dev Greg continues to do nothing but bask in his own delusion of supreme genius, splitting the devs, booting out the best minds in a trojan horse take over, turning the entire community into a warzone in his wake: needs censored b/bitcoin to receive cheers. 
Bitcoin did much better under Gavin's watch going from $1 to $1,000 than it has under Core's watch. 
BItcoin investors lost (did not earn)   billions... who cares.
Bitcoin is the train you want to jump from.
Even after the bug in BU, the blocks mined signalling for BU are at an all-time high. Only a mater of time until they surpass SegWit: rbitcoin & core devs keep sticking their heads in the sand.
