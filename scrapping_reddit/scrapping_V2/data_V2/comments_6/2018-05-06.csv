Do you really think that will happen?  This is an actual question, not rhetorical.  I just do not see that happening and why would it?  Then every time another new Bitcoin Cash comes along and overtakes it becomes the new Bitcoin?  Think about the implications.. no, I don't see it happening like that nor should it - it would be too confusing!

Whether you agree or disagree with the development teams decisions when working on project A or project B, Project A is still project A, even if B is better.  

Only my opinion that the naming discussion is really binary - even on https://bitcoincash.com/faq/ do they talk about Bitcoin Cash being a continuation of the Bitcoin project.  That has to be done to avoid confusion from A to B.  Bitcoin Cash can still be *the best bitcoin* but I don't see it being Bitcoin."

You’re acting as though a neutral third party is *less* reliable than a rabid shill. 
This annoys me as well. It takes no balls to be like 'ah yeah I don't care about either' because it's evident how much fake flak you get from brainwashed trolls for daring to even see the other point of view that bitcoin has been bent over a table and raped. It's exactly how they want this whole thing to go down. Passive apathy about the situation helps no one. Get angry. Take a stand and make some noise.

"Coke is owned by a central authority that decides what Coke is. Bitcoin has no central authority, only competing implementations. If one of those implementations decides to make a radical change while the original continues to still exist, it follows that the radically changed version should choose a new name.

Since there are two implementations currently competing for the same hashpower, there should be a way to differentiate them by name.  Bitcoin Cash is the name of the one that resembles the original vision, and Bitcoin Core is what the radically changed one is being called since it’s community hasn’t chosen a name on their own. When the competition is resolved, the winner can simply be called bitcoin and go on its way. Until that time, it is reasonable that people refer to them by names which differentiate the type of bitcoin they are referring to.

We’re talking in circles. It’s been fun, but I’m afraid we’re not going to see eye to eye on the issue.

Cheers."
"I'm curious if you do use bitcoin to buy goods or services, or conduct business, on a day to day basis, which is the whole point of cash. Cash needs to flow. 

People who use bitcoin as cash on a daily basis may recall a time when their beloved BTC (formerly market dominating cryptocurrency) used to **consistently** have fast, cheap, and reliable transactions. 

That use case for bitcoin as cash is being fleshed out by development in the BCH ecosystem, now (not in 18 months+). It's mind-boggling that one would advocate for restricting growth and the blocksize limit while waiting around holding a bitcoin that's essentially unusable at peak user capacity with $25, $30, $50+ fees. For BCH I don't ever need to check mempool conditions to estimate ""normal"" or ""urgent"" fee levels. 

An invitation to economic participation by those making less than $2 a day will change the world. There are people and entities who either do not care for them (the poorest billions), or have vested interests that are not aligned with that vision."
"Your using rhetoric to cover up the truth of the situation. BTC Core development is also a descendant of the ""Bitcoin project"" even though it has strayed far from that project's goals. Calling it Bitcoin does not make it the true Bitcoin (for either side of this debate). Capturing the GitHub is also not a reliable determination of what's going on here."
"No, both are not equally valid; you got a crippled impostor, and the other is Bitcoin Cash."
Come on, surely you have more persuasive arguments left...?
BCH is still P2P cash. Much closer to original formula than BTC. 🥤
A typical [gaslighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting) response. If it's so clearly NOT fact, it wouldn't take much to illustrate that. But this is clearly a trek too far, and about all the Core supporters can do is gaslight.
Removal of the alkaloid in Coka leaves isn't radical? You know its whole name has the origin because of that coca plant and its utility was originally not as a fizzy drink but as *medicine*? Yet you are fine in saying that it resembles it's original vision, but think it's wrong when Bitcoin changes. See the issue here now in your analogy?

"Coke didn’t radically change into a different product that no longer resembles coke in the way that core devs have radically changed BTC into a product that no longer resembles bitcoin. I don’t get the point you’re trying to make.

Core created something that’s not P2P cash, so it hardly makes sense to call it bitcoin, because bitcoin is P2P electronic cash. Bitcoin is not just whatever core decides it is."

There is only one bitcoin, then there are additional forks / descendants of bitcoin like Bitcoin Cash

Directly from the Bitcoin Cash Github:

Bitcoin Cash is a descendant of Bitcoin."
I dont think you understood what I said. Bitcoin Core runs on the Bitcoin network, Bitcoin ABC runs on the Bitcoin Cash network. Terms like 'Core' and 'Cash' are ambiguous.
"I'm not arguing that BCH should be called just 'Bitcoin', but rather that BTC should be called Bitcoin Core or something like that to differentiate it from Bitcoin the architecture/idea, and from other chains that share both the architecture and the blockchain until recently.

Like it or not, BCH is already important enough that its existence should be acknowledged. Calling BTC just Bitcoin is misleading noobs into thinking there is only one Bitcoin.

It's different from Linux (kernel) and Linux distros, as cash forked away from core and the two went their separate ways. Cash does not depend on core in any way."

Manipulation? Or explaining in ways you don't agree. I could point out how this sub ""manipulates"" as well. Hell going back to the original comment! Adding ""Core"" which is 100% unneeded since literally everyone knows what you mean when you say Bitcoin. And those that don't are being obtuse to make ""their coin"" better. Bitcoin Diamond and Bitcoin Gold didn't need ""Core"" after Bitcoin. So why does Roger and Bitcoin Cash? And Bitcoin.com. Why not coinbase?? "
Yes and if it has been a hard fork, as all updates should be, then Bitcoin would have continued on and Bitcoin segwit would have been created. The fact that they have been using soft forks for years to implement changes that are good for blockstream projects and not the rest of the ecosystem. 
"But I forgot about the point I was going to make. Sorry for the double post. I've seen multiple people see Core then get confused and stay away from Bitcoin Cash. It just has a general scammy feeling to it. And that is something we'd have to overcome.

"Many of us disagree with your premise. The majority of the hashrate and market cap and txs are easy to measure mathematically.

On the flip side however trying to say that bch is not also bitcoin is silly. Bitcoin is not 1 thing anymore. That is hard for some people to accept. All of the forks of bitcoin including bitcoin pizza and bitcoin gold are bitcoin. Whether or not you think they are legitimate projects or scams however is opinion. I personally think BCH is the best implementation of what Satoshi originally envisioned. Which is why I choose to support it. But I do not deny that BTC is also the core devs team's opinion of the best progression of the bitcoin project. I can not speak for everyone, but I think the majority of people I know personally would be satisfied if people on the BTC side quit trying to deny that BCH is also bitcoin and lay off the ""bcash btrash chinese scam coin rhetoric!"".

i would agree github doesnt play back the entire history about bitcoin and bitcoin cash but even without that history the name is still what it is.  bitcoin cash will always be bitcoin cash, these are technology / software products and naming is pretty easy to determine.  unless the goal is to get the bitcoin project to turn over the name and if that happens sure, then bitcoin cash (and all its preferred changes) become bitcoins.  i just dont see that happening."

People have called pyrite gold in the past. What we call things is always a social construction.
talking about software changes vs naming, analogy doesnt fail because bitcoin cash is taking a different direction.  it *should* take a different direction in attempt to improve the product and it is still a fork of bitcoin, still making it 'bitcoin cash', but not 'bitcoin'
"Also for the record I have just as much Bitcoin Cash as I do Bitcoin so you saying ""your side"" is pretty stupid and the fact you think there are sides is sad. "

Of course since that is the proper name.

"I actually hope we choose to be bold and keep the Bitcoin Cash title for the protocol and set the precedent of *Bitcoin Newname* for future forks, not unlike the many shards of BTC this year. It should be shared, not constantly consolidated by some group or another. We need to kill the idea that ""longst chain has rights to the name"" because that is simply mis\-understood bullshit by people who don't understand what Satoshi wrote about that.

I say that mostly because if we go back to being *Bitcoin* we're going to have this whole fucking stupid problem happen again someday when BCH spawns an offshoot \(which anyone can do at any time for any reason\).

*Bitcoin* should be used the same way as *Linux*\*.\*

That aside, why erase Bitcoin Cash's illustrious, impossible journey by removing the Cash part of its history? Its a badge of honor to me, and frankly the first *Bitcoin* should have had a name like that from day 1. The mistake was calling the first live implementation the same name as the whitepaper. "
"So to you, 1/5 criteria defines bitcoin, I’ll take the 4/5 that is Bitcoin Cash with 4 out of 5 checkmarks describing the real bitcoin.

Bitcoin Cash is 80% Bitcoin, Bitcoin Core is 20% Bitcoin. Deal with it. 

And the only reason BTC has that 1/5 criteria is because miners are greedy, the very thing that BTC is trying to kill, will end up killing BTC. 

Good luck! "
"I totally agree with you. And I think the whole crypto world would be better off if BTC and BCH quit bickering with eachother.

I think in the long run, BTC and BCH will be seen as successful projects that helped test out two different ideas for scaling."
For me it's simple. Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin is Bitcoin.
"Why does BCH always try to take stuff that wasn't theirs to begin with. You wanna steal the Bitcoin name, the piratebay.

So troll.
why can't we just do both? segwit bigger blocks and lightning network, why split and fight
"There is no confusion, the name is bitcoin cash and the official website is bitcoincash.org.

I refer to both as BCH and BTC often, personally I think this whole discussion is misplaced because I never saw anyone marketing BCH as BTC. Calling BCH ""bitcoin"" is not wrong at all, because it is bitcoin, same for BTC.

I find helpful to distinguish ""bitcoin cash"" from ""bitcoin core"" (a core's project, ""bitcoin core"" ipso facto). 

While everybody is complaining about names, bitcoin.org is marketing BTC wrongfully, but you don't see a swarm of trolls posting it everywhere.

http://bitcoin.org  german, spanish, korean, japanese, chinese versions as examples:

""Geringe bis keine Transaktionskosten""

“Comisiones muy bajas o inexistentes”

""무료 또는 낮은 수수료""

""ゼロあるいは安価な 手数料""

""零或极低的 手续费""

""幾乎為零的 手續費""

All of them saying more or less ''*zero* to very low fees''=scamming people.

In english

""Low processing fees"" which is also false."
"Bitcoin Cash respresents a return to the original Bitcoin design, as it ran for 8 years, and it uses the historical Bitcoin ledger (no investors were disenfranchised, sound money was preserved). This is the ""BCH is Bitcoin"" aspect that needs to be emphasized, not some metaphysical or semantic war. 

That said, keeping in mind that every new 10x surge in adoption and price comes almost entirely from NEW users, businesses and investors, there is probably a system bias among us oldtimers toward overestimating how important the name is. New people do care that it's a stable ledger with 9 years of history, but I think most care more that it is cheap, fast, secure, reliable and eminently useful in a wide array of situations."
I wish more people thought like you. Maybe a lot of us do? I think there is a vocal minority that think rather highly of themselves that are hellbent on taking over Bitcoin \(at least in name\). It has rubbed me the wrong way since the fork. Live and let live. Let them both succeed and prosper. Perhaps in the future there will be a need for both chains. If not, one will naturally die off. 
well said
Do you have a choice?
"I also do not mind calling Bitcoin Cash ""bcash"". it's smooth and fast."
"I think the people who care the most what it's called are from BTC.

Personally I don't care what other people think about my preferred naming scheme. "
Core and Cash software run on the same network. Try not to make things more confusing on purpose.
I like it being called Bitcoin Cash, good reminder of what happened. Never forget.
Fight the toxic dipshits who hijacked the project and ruined the brand every step of the way. Don't let the cult of core get away with their crimes. Fuck theymos and his thugs. Resist them now and forever. 
This
To me, Bitcoin is what Bitcoin was before the scaling debate. Bitcoin Core is what Blockstream made it after the split, and Bitcoin Cash is what the BCH teams made it after the split. I don't care if they keep those names, and even if BCH were to gain immensely compared to BTC, I'd likely still keep calling them Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Core.
"Totally agree. Stop worrying about what is and isn't the ""real"" bitcoin and just grow Bitcoin Cash into a dominant force in the market."
The vote brigading is strong in this thread.
I agree with OP
calling it different names will not bring anything positive, it will just create confusion. Until one dies, bitcoin will be bitcoin and bitcoin cash will be bitcoin cash. Trying to present one as the other is not the right way to push adoption
Personally i prefer the shortened name bcash. Rolls off the tounge easily.
Nope. I just refer to it as bcash...so much more easier to say and just rolls off the tongue.
">Am I the only one that doesn't mind Bitcoin Cash being called ""Bitcoin Cash"" instead of just ""Bitcoin"" (for now)?


No.  Its mostly you and every Bitcoin Core troll.  There are a few of them, though we're not sure how many actual individual humans.  If we look at the Bitcoin.com lawsuit, there were over 3k upvotes on one thread and another thread claiming ""600"" people were starting the lawsuit.  When reality took over and their vote-brigading took a back seat, it ended up being 31 people.  

By the way, nice job giving them something to upvote to further their anti-BCH hatred.   Your service is appreciated I'm sure."
"downvoted because of shilling propaganda and concern trolling

Bitcoin is Bitcoin Cash, deal with it"
I call them Bitcoin Cash and bitcoin core just to differentiate.  Even though I know Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin.
"I think it's best for the cryptocurrency industry as a whole if no currency calls itself ""Bitcoin"". 

In my opinion, it's more important that the other bitcoin be called something other than just ""bitcoin"". Call it ""Bitcoin Core"", or ""Bitcoin Legacy"" or ""Bcore"" or whatever, just as long as it's not just simply ""Bitcoin"". Calling BCH ""Bitcoin (BCH)"" adds just enough confusion that people will start calling the other Bitcoin something else."
"You can call Coke Zero ""Coca-Cola"" as much as you want, but it will never be Coca-Cola. This sub is trying to gaslight the world into believing a lie, it's ridiculous."
Couldn't agree more. From a technological standpoint I think BCH has the better hand. The fucking politics, name calling, namejacking and all the drama that comes with it is, in my opinion, detrimental to all of us. 
"No, someone altered the code and tricked the masses into calling their crippled altcoin ""bitcoin"", killing the original Bitcoin in the process; then right  before a particularly bad modification was about to go online, a group of various big players, miners, devs, businesses etc, decided that enough was enough, and revived the original Bitcoin, but unfortunately, they did not had the level of power over the flow of information to the masses to be able to instantly reclaim the ""Bitcoin"" name, the revived Bitcoin is what for the moment is more well known as Bitcoin Cash."
This sub is like a hydra mutating and warping with every passing week.
Bitcoin Core is the software, Bitcoin is the network. Why make things even more confusing? You already have a BCH forum on r/BTC, I dont think you need any more confussion. What mess have you guys got yourself into? [Bring the downvote]
"I'm one of those who post on both subs and don't particularly want to be banned from either. I don't have such concerns on twitter where I follow Bitcoin Cash and the controversies re SM. I'm more interested in finding those few people who have something worthwhile to say about whatever.

Not owning either coin (at the moment) just makes it easier to do so. The civil war will end eventually and most will get over it and move on. It was briefly fun to troll the obvious trolls but I got over that fast.

Went back and read the whitepaper (again) as I've also heard rumors that it needs to be 'upgraded' of all things as it doesn't reflect the 'upgrades' to Bitcoin! Surely that's more important that trying to 'steal' the name. Just not interested in going to war over it though it's a point worth  making to all newcomers- but rumors need to be substantiated. Choose the battles you can win. That's all"
"It's about the whitepaper as much as it's about the code. Bitcoin Cash holds the whitepaper to be 'sacrosanct' and changing  it to reflect 'reality' may become a future battle in this war particularly over LN - but the war (chain split) more or less started with the insistence that Segwit was 'necessary' (for LN), also over scaling, hard vs soft forks and over the role of the miners and mining hardware. And that's just a brief overview of the controversies.

It's about interpreting the 'gospel' of SN (and even the  role of SN) which was always going to happen anyway just that nobody seems to have realized that before he left and he didn't exactly offer a lot of guidance either. Maybe he was too modest to realize that he would become something of an icon to many - but not to all - because his role and his anonymity has become a point of contention before anyone truly knows what and where this is all leading to."
*trying to kill the original Bitcoin in the process...
"Totally agree with you. 

One issue is the “Bitcoin Cash = Bitcoin” crowd seems to not have a strict definition of what “Bitcoin” is. Before, it was [Gavin’s definition](http://gavinandresen.ninja/a-definition-of-bitcoin) which basically says “the longest chain wins”. For a while that’s what Bitcoin XT etc was going for. After that since BCH is clearly not the longest chain there’s an evolved definition about the “original” protocol but that is a loose concept too as a lot of the transaction types we use these days came from forks after the original white paper. It’s hard to argue what a name means when there is no concise definition of said term.

Also, Bitcoin Cash came from a lack of consensus especially from miners. The fork initially clearly branded itself as “Bitcoin Cash”, even though it puts itself as closer to the original vision. This rebranding itself as “Bitcoin” un-ironically is actually making the coin lose credibility and reputation among the greater crypto crowd. It also adds unnecessary confusion in regular discussions. E.g. Ethereum Classic doesn’t say it is “Ethereum” without extra qualifications. Like it or not, it was Bitcoin Cash’s decision to fork and given it is still a minority hash chain I can’t really say “Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin” with a straight face. I will say it’s my preferred protocol that fulfills what Bitcoin’s vision more though. 

And also, this naming debate just seems to detract from the more important issues."
"every branch may (and should) fight to be the best branch of bitcoin, but there will only be one bitcoin.  i hope someday to use bitcoin.peopleb4things and it is the best bitcoin.  but it would still be the peopleb4things bitcoin, not just bitcoin.

you may not view them as products but by definition it is a product with advantages and disadvantages within branches. 
 a product that we the people, buy or mine to use, as electronic cash, within the peer to peer system."
"since we are talking about the name and not the better technology - there is a bitcoin project, its here:

https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin

BCH working on a descendant of the bitcoin project, they even say it on their page ""Bitcoin Cash is a descendant of Bitcoin.""

https://github.com/Bitcoin-ABC/bitcoin-abc

"Calling Bitcoin Cash ""Bitcoin"" is deceiving. I understand the history of BTC and BCH but for the sake of clarity of online discussions, people should call them with their appropriate name or ticker.

In time, if the BTC experiment fail and BCH prevail, then a discussion about renaming BCH to BTC would be relevant."
"Massive effort to keep on calling bitcoin bitcoin? Users, exchanges, merchants etc all just had to keep on using the clients and name as they always had, so theres no need for a ""massive effort"" for bitcoin to keep on being what it always has been. The bitcoin literally had to do nothing to keep the name as there is no confusion.  Outside of this crazy sub there is zero confusion as to what is bitcoin. The confusion only exists here, @bitcoin and on bitcoin.com.

Tricking people into thinking that there are now two bitcoins, and both are equally valid, and actually the ""new one"" is the ""realest"". Now theres a massive effort."
"""objectively fact"" rofl."
"I'm simply not going to give up the name to those thieves. 

It continues the conflict? Good. They're still fighting and if your side gives up it's just a slaughter."
"Right. That's why there's Bitcoin and there's also Bitcoin Cash. Just as there was Bitcoin Gold before and no one needed ""Core"" added to tell the differences. "
"Funny how you say ""stooping to their level"" but insist on calling it Bitcoin ""Core"""
"> ""bcash"" was started as a direct attack by trolls to rename the project from the first hour of the fork

Hold up, like it or not the term bcash was first suggested here in /r/btc at the same time as Bitcoin Cash. It's used as a derogatory basically ever since then but let's not get all revisionist here and claim that they actually came up with the term instead of just embracing it. I doubt anyone would even care anymore if bcash didn't turn into a meme to piss off Roger.

As far as bcash taking off organically is concerned, that's not a hypothetical, it was suggested since day one and basically everyone agreed that Bitcoin Cash was a better name. Either you recently created a new throwaway account, or more likely, you weren't here when this originally happened.

bcash wouldn't even be mentioned at this point if Roger hadn't acted like a literal 5 year old and thrown a tantrum about it."
"true.

this drama sucks."
Yes! Ive done that too. bcash and bcore, lol
"Please start the campaign over on r/bitcoin to make it a neutral ground without censorship with all new neutral mods, in return we will give up r/btc to become the Bitcoin core sanctioned censor zone and those that want to can move to a Bitcoin cash only sub. I am sure ""community consensus"" will be easy to reach over there. "
So Coca-Cola isn't Coca-Cola because it doesn't have coca extract anymore as stated by it's original recipe? That's where the flaw in that analogy is, things change and develop that doesn't mean a new branding is required.
I often call them bcash and bcore just to piss everyone off equally. The whole Bitcoin community is so devisive and toxic and not the awesome one I remember working with back in the day that I think we need to do a lot of work to earn the Bitcoin name back. 
"> changes to the protocol called Lightning Network...

This is something that gets repeated a lot but there are no changes to Bitcoin to work with Lightning network. This is FUD. The only change to Bitcoin has been the addition of SegWit which is still compatible with older constraints on blocks. That's not to say that SegWit wasn't a change, it was, but in a clever way that makes SegWit blocks look like and validate as older blocks did.

The fact of the matter is that there is absolutely zero code related to the Lightning network added to Bitcoin. Lightning doesn't depend on a specific cryptocurrency and it works just as well with Litecoin for instance. The only reason why SegWit is often described as required for Lightning Network is because SegWit also fixed transaction malleability. LN is still totally possible even without fixing transaction malleability, the problem is that an attacker can screw with your transactions in such a way as to lock up your funds until your channel expires and sends the coins back to you. Even without totally fixing transaction malleability Bitcoin Cash could still use Lightning network to transfer coins offchain."
"You may be the first to point out that 'this whole fucking stupid problem [could] happen again someday"" over the bitcoin (BCH) name - though not sure if you meant 'Bitcoin' or 'Bitcoin Cash'.

Point taken though.

The idea of ""rights to the name"" for open-source anonymously authored (code?) whose specifictions are an academically cited whitepaper. Don't suppose SN ever thought he had reason to be concerned about it. Maybe this really ought to go to trial to establish case law - someone has to arbitrate these things  - but jurisdiction is going to have to be argued to start with.

Also, it's going to attract a host of interested parties wanting to define exactly what is being contested here, not just who owns the name 'bitcoin', Is there a 'chain of custody' or 'provenance' for claiming to be the 'true' Bitcoin. Seems that it's a case of a 'Recipe' vs a 'Dish'.

I prefer BCH, but find it incredibly childish and an absolute dickhead move by Ver to try and take over the Bitcoin name. We should embrace and market our differences instead of trying to trick newcomers into thinking we are core. Additionally, to just making us all not seem like total assholes, it would quell 99.9% of opposition to BCH. People don't hate us because we have bigger blocks, faster and cheaper transactions, they hate us because the way we have gone about antagonizing the market. 
"Unfortunately, there has been a massive effort to make the uninformed masses call bitcoin Core ""bitcoin"", and it continues long after Core had destroyed the original Bitcoin."
Surely you mean a **GNU**/Linux distribution!
Consensus will do what consensus does
That's okay. we will pet you extra to bring you back around. 
Not at all. Marketing is essentially dressing something up, but stating that BCH is the cryptocurrency that is the closest to the [Bitcoin white paper](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/bitcoin), and that has been truest in following prescribed Nakamoto Consensus in practice *and* in intent is objectively fact.
Redditor /u/bitking74 has low karma in this subreddit.
"The original is no more; Core made sure of that. The closest thing to the original we got now is Bitcoin Cash"
nah, never yield to the mob
So bitcoin cash was the original? Please, you're being intellectually dishonest.
So, your saying there is no longer any Bitcoin project. That's not true. BCH is still working on the Bitcoin project. Core hopes their project is Bitcoin again someday, but, that looks unlikely at this point.
Good analogy 
You a BCH
glad you agree
Wait, so you agree that BCH is stupid then, as you noted above?
Yeah, a total cuck too!
A stupid BCH
Yeah, I really am! I'm a total BCH, whatever that is...
Yeah, totally!

What is the healthy limit for blocksize?  What happens if it gets too big?
There's no reason there can't be off chain solutions for BCH. Holding the network hostage to force them is ridiculous. Right now, on chain scaling is perfectly reasonable.
but when the demand for TB drives rises, then the price will also rise, like with graphic cards
I ideal decentralizion that would be true, but in reality there are only 2000 people running full nodes for BCH and blockchains aren't that remanding yet for people to mass buy data drives. Compared to graphics card, each mining rig has several gpu's and only on drive.
"I would agree that on chain scaling is only viable up to a certain point. The more costly it is to run a node the less incentivized people are to run one.

Off chain solutions are the only ones that make sense to me, as storing each and every transaction on the blockchain is a really inefficient way to go at it."
