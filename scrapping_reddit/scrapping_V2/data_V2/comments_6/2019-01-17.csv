Yup. Can’t ban them, that’s a slippery slope. We will just need to live with it.
It’s you isn’t it? 
"Oh I agree. Vote manipulation however is against Reddit ToS. 

A ban is probably justified in this case. Proof however is not easy to come by."
You can keep your savings in Venezuelan Bolivar, too. It's a government issued fiat currency with tons of liquidity. The value thing, however ...
"You may want to double check your info... Daily txs now = Daily txs a year ago, when median fee was $30?

Wanna try again?"
It does though, by using different scaling solution - the Lightning Network. And even on-chain transactions are cheap now.
I’ve got lunch money left. Does that count?
"Compare the mempool. Sure, maybe same amount of tx's/block (due to 1mb+SW limit) but not the same amount of tx's in queue to get into a block.

Wanna try again?

EDIT: Instead of downvoting me if you think I´m wrong, respond with why you don´t agree."
"If LN is a scaling solution you could also say converting to Fiat is a scaling solution. 

>And even on-chain transactions are cheap now.

This is because users like me were driven away. If you limit usage it will stay cheap for the 25 people that use it."
Coinbase won't unlock my lunch money wallet until I have $17 worth. I definitely had $10 worth at the start of the school year, but it seems like only about $5 left.  I guess Ill be hungry for a while...
Unfortunately we can’t ban them. Just going to have to put up with the noise.

"Of course it's not the same txs in the mempool, that's the whole point of increasing capacity, to reduce txs in the mempool. Since txs today = txs one year ago, this proves beyond doubt that SegWit did function as a capacity increase. (Fees, btw, are ridiculously low.)

Wanna try again? Hint: Usage = Txs in blocks, NOT txs in the mempool.

Edit: I didn't downvote you..."
This is old though right? Like 2012?
This is definitely a vote manipulation lol. But why?
An old pic, saw it years ago
Btc still a thing?

"Does anyone have change for a button?

&#x200B;"
Cool opinion but that's not how bitcoin works. No one needs your permission to be their own bank. 
I am fearing that this will happen in the future. The Simpsons can show you the future. 
"It specifically says ""lunch money"" not ""lunch savings"".

Money is to be spent, savings are to be held. Bitcoin is money, NOT a store of value"
At what year this episode came out.
Nice! Thank you for sharing, haven’t heard anything about bitcoin on The Simpsons yet. :)
Wow! the simpsons are still a thing! who would know.
Looking at OP's other posting activity (not just here), looks like much of the same. Organic posts, 1-2 total karma, then a shitpost/repost, bam, 300+. 
"Leader bitcoin excuse me a few minutes accidentally sent  clip sound waves. don't intend and deleted immediately. Is it effective to you?
"
During december of 2017 when fee's where reaching it's peak it where around 25-30% more tx's/day. Do you think that BTC can handle that today with segwit without getting a growing backlog in the mempool so that the bid wars begin again?
