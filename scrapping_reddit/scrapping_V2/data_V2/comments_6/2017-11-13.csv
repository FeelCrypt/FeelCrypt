Tipping 1000 BTC can't be real, can it? Otherwise this is the most mind boggling thing ever, like casually handing out winning lottery tickets.
You know that satoshi all the time thought fraud proofs for SPV clients would be way easier to implement, when he made this statement?
Silliness, we need real experts not these autistic idiot Core people with giant neckbeards, blue hair, no teeth, and can barely interact socially.  They are not the type of people to be in charge and make important decisions in a social economic system.  I have already outlined how these people like Adam Back [are not experts at all](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/66ymxs/adam_back_is_not_a_bitcoin_expert_if_he_were_then/), they are merely specialists, and not even good ones at that.  The only reason they got in their position was because they bullied and forced others out.  They are the scum of the Earth and justice will be served.  Never fuck with the Honey Badger.

"Absolute majority of people inside and outside of crypto are lightly left-leaning. They think that open blockchains empower people as collective, that we will share, sing together and everyone will be more happy. 

Sorry, no!

">  Bitcoin Cash is a long way from taking over

Of course, I didn't expect that to happen overnight but I also think Bitcoin Core team have a long way to being able to scale, LN is years from being used daily."
We already have [SPV wallets like Electrum that work great](https://electrum.org/bcc.txt).  Those poor excuses for cypherpunks write code like politicians write laws.  The more complex, and kludgey, and the more commits, the prouder they are of their accomplishments.  Then the false cypherpunks hold up a bunch of commits on github and claim they are so great, same way as politicians claim they are so great for passing so many horrible laws.  Bitcoin works despite the damage these clueless specialist developers have done.  They have no clue about economics or how Bitcoin works generally, that is why they are coders, they have a specialist mind, similar to an idiot savant type of autist, and its no coincidence many of these devs fit that profile.  Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin, and if you don't like the white paper and Satoshi's vision then enjoy your segshit coin.  Its not looking like its going to turn out well.  
"Price doesn't matter here per se cos there's fiat hyperinflation factor (even without crypto the current colossal debt pyramid wouldn't have a chance). Millions of dollars per bitcoin, maybe

haha thanks :)
No, could you please elaborate.  I think its very simple for SPV to work, all any user needs to do is query a number of nodes and compare them to get near certainty that they have the right history.
It really boggles the mind
Prepping doesn't really suit me. My best hope is something like territorially-closed community in USA for the storm and projects like [FreeSociety.com](http://FreeSociety.com). Without joking companies like Coinbase will make headquarters in such pockets and will have private armies
"If there are 10000 real nodes, and 20000 fake nodes on just 20 machines having 1000 IPs each, how do you find out what is real and what not?
Sure, just hardcode in some ""trusted"" nodes -> paypal 2.0 which no one wants.  
  
> Do you realize that there is no such thing as 100% security

That is exactly the engineering view bitcoin needs lol"
[deleted]
"That would be easy to manipulate by just spawning 1000s of fake nodes giving fake history.  
I don't have the technical knowledge to explain this in detail, but IMHO i got a good understanding in an abstract way to tell that what would be needed to make SPV 100% fraud proof would be to make it a full node.  
Considering that, there is no secure SPV, anyone who claims otherwise always quoting satoshi, please explain or link to somewhere where it is explained how a perfect fraud proof SPV is possible to implement?  
Because if it is not, we are WAY more secure with LN or even doing most transactions offchain using trusted services like coinbase.  
Those who need the real bitcoin network will have to pay some fees for having the privilege."
[deleted]
"I dont think spinning up 1000s of fakes will be a good enough attack.  You can query enough nodes to figure out that they are fake.  What is your definition of ""secure SPV""? Do you realize that there is no such thing as 100% security, there is a spectrum that security exists on and you can never achieve 100%.  So if SPV can be 99.9999999999999999% reliable then that is pretty darn good."
"Well I think [this article with Dr Craig Wright](https://coingeek.com/craig-wright-on-bitcoin-scalability/) does a great job of winning this argument.  He also addresses your point of fraud proofs:

> Now, the first thing we need to understand is that all encryption systems are probabilistic. Password systems and any modern information security system works on probabilistic information. The so-called experts who talk about the probabilistic system of bitcoin fail to comprehend that strong encryption is probabilistic.

> Fraud proofs and nowhere near as difficult as anyone thinks. They do not require some special cryptographic protocol. They are far simpler to implement than anyone seems to understand.

> The solution is incredibly simple. All you need to do is randomly select a series of nodes on the network and query whether the inclusion of your transaction has occurred on that node. Each query would be random. Using a simple Bayesian algorithm, we could use a failure model to analyse the likelihood of a double spend or other attack.” – Dr Craig Wright

Maybe he is Satoshi after all huh?

Ok, trying that one
"That being said, how about you BCH guys make the needed speed improvements on chain instead of complaining, then we talk?  
Oh i see, core is doing that already. So what is your value here?"
Why would you pay with btc at the store? You would have to pay taxes for your coffee. 
"Who says there will be more nodes with BCH? It is a risky and not even needed assumption. I will prefer sound money over a paypal 2.0 payment network that MAY be decentralized enough and MAY even work at all. Did you sync bitcoin lately on a high end hardware? I did, and i sure as hell don't want it to take 8x longer, or 50x longer as years go by.
If i can't sync a node, i can't run a node."

"Segwitcoin will be [centralized on LN](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6jqrub/game_over_blockstream_mathematical_proof_that_the/).  Technology grows, over time and can accomodate.  If you have trouble running a node, then update your hardware, simple.  Satoshi Nakamoto the inventor of Bitcoin said [users do not need to run nodes](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=532.msg6306#msg6306):

> The current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale.  That would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server.  The design supports letting users just be users.  The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be.  Those few nodes will be big server farms.  The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don't generate.

If you don't like Bitcoin's design you should have went and started an alt-coin instead of trying to change the original vision into segwit AXA/Bilderberg BlockStream coin."
"It does not nullify asicboost at all....barely anyone uses segwit and miners don;t have to include segwit transactions.  Actually bigger blocks is the worst thing for asicboost by making collisions more rare.  So why is Jihan pushing blocksize increase if it hurts asicboost? Logic fail."
Hard decentralization? Sounds silly, what does that mean?  Decentralization exists on a spectrum, and has many facets to it.  By having more nodes all over the world and more users even if nodes are more expensive to run results in more decentralization and more censorship resistance.  Strangling blocksize forcing everyone to off-chain centralized solutions is not decentralization, sorry.
"In the long run, even BTC will have a large memory requirement. 

But BTC is broken *now*. BCH gives everyone time - years and years of time, probably - to come up with a way to scale that doesn't break the coin with shit like segwit."
"Because Bitcoin does have plenty of stuff in the pipeline to speed up transactions. 

Far far more developers working on it, and those developers have lots of experience with these systems. 

If bitcoin is ever overthrown it will be a slow and steady slide, not the 'flippening' that people talk of. 
I'm not fussed which wins, I have money in both to hedge my bets, but Bitcoin Cash is a long way from taking over. "

Are you saying its more likely that there was a global conspiracy to get every single country on earth off the gold standard regardless of the benefits to that country, rather than that countries gradually switched over from the gold standard over the 20th century when it became apparent that being able to increase and decrease the money supply at will was more useful than being limited by however much gold you could get your hands on?
"Yeah ChangeTip was great, as was bitcointip before it.  

I'm also very glad to see a tip bot back in operation, tips are one of the best ways of doing outreach!"
"Here's the abridged version.  

Bitcoin blocks are created about once every 10 minutes.  The Bitcoin block contains all the transactions that happened since the last block was created.  

There is a limit that each block can only be 1MB in size.  This was added by Satoshi as a spam filter, so a bad person couldn't flood the network with gigabyte-size blocks and grind things to a halt.  The idea was we would change or remove the limit when we got close to hitting it.  

As Bitcoin becomes more popular and more people use it, that means more transactions happen every 10 minutes, which means more data to pack into each block.  Once we hit about 3-4 transactions per second, that will create about 1MB of block data every 10 mins.  

Since 2012, we've known this would be a problem.  Since 2012, people like Gavin Andresen have been trying to get the limit raised.  The people in charge of Bitcoin-Core development have never agreed to do this, because not everybody would agree that it should be raised, or because people are worried that raising it would cause a problem, or because insert the reason of the week.  

In 2014, Gavin went around the Bitcoin-Core devs and released his own software called Bitcoin-XT.  It had a code that when 75% of the miners started using it, it would raise the block size.  
The moderator of /r/bitcoin and bitcointalk forums (a guy called Theymos) decided that XT was bad, so he would try to kill it using the moderator power he had.  So he decreed that since XT isn't fully compatible with Core, it's not Bitcoin, and thus prohibited advocating it on /r/Bitcoin or bitcointalk.  Lots of people got banned.  That's why /r/btc was created.  

Anyway long story short- after XT started to gain traction, someone started DDoS attacking all XT nodes so it was killed.  A bit later there was another more conservative proposal called Bitcoin Classic.  When it picked up steam, a few Core devs flew to China to meet with miners, they banged out an agreement that SegWit (Core's answer to scaling) would be released soon and a 2MB block size upgrade would follow from Core.  Miners agreed and dropped Classic.  The deadline was blown, Core never offered a real block size upgrade (the only one came from LukeJr in the form of a proposal that reduced the block size to 300KB then raised it over several years), and even other Core devs called the ones who negotiated ""well meaning dipshits"" who didn't actually have authority to negotiate on behalf of Core.  So Classic died.  
Next came Bitcoin Unlimited.  Unlimited removed the 1MB limit entirely, replacing it with an 'emergent consensus' system whereby miners would each set their own preferred limit and the network would adjust accordingly.  It started to get popular, hitting 50% of the miner support, while SegWit (now finally out) was languishing at 30%.  So that meant another agreement- SegWit2x (aka the NYA agreement).  We'll activate SegWit now, then do a hard fork upgrade to 2MB blocks in November.  SegWit was activated immediately, but the 2x fork (originally scheduled for November 17th) was attacked by Core supporters as a 'corporate takeover' 'hostile attack' etc etc.  Miner support dropped from 95+% to ~80%, exchanges decided to support both sides of the fork (thus making it a split rather than an upgrade), and the fork was recently cancelled.  

So now we're left with a clogged Bitcoin that has doesn't have enough capacity for the transaction load of people trying to use it.  Fees go up, wait times go up, transactions get delayed or dropped.  The Core supporters don't consider this to be a problem.  

OTOH, the Bitcoin Cash people DO consider this to be a problem.  Cash was created on August 1, as a hard fork split from Bitcoin.  Cash has a block size limit of 8MB- plenty for all the users we have today and in the next few years.  

Hope that clears things up!"
Ignore the white paper.  Jerk devs who think they control bitcoin when people are sick of waiting for key features of speed and low fees.   It is the true Bitcoin. Not bcash or btrash.   I have 466 BTC and 849 BCH.  Heck I wish I would have gotten the BTG ...  I keep them all as I have no crystal ball but I'm friend of CW. 
Shoutout to Tone Vays for teaching me TA!
That graph is the BTC mempool.The larger the mempool, the longer the time it takes for a BTC transaction to be confirmed. The different bands represent different levels of transaction fees per byte of transaction.
In layman's terms, it's how many transactions (tx) are waiting to be processed
"Well, it seems there are quite a few companies in India that scam people, calling in and saying they are Microsoft support and that there's a problem with your computer.

They then try to get you to give access to your computer via remote desktop. They then encrypt your drive, and you are supposed to pay ransom to get your hard drive decrypted (or not).

There are videos on Youtube about this (BTW I'm not a racist, I think it's just that people in India are poor and for them, this scamming is a way to survive).

Now the guy in the video called back two such scammers on two different cell phones at the same time, then gets them to talk to each other.

You then get a few hilarious verbal exchanges between the two scammers :)
"
Coming soon at the CME :)
I've run a gas chromatography mass spectrometry on this graph and the results indicate the fees should be at -21million btc by tomorrow. Essentially you get the entire bitcoin network! Invest quick guys!
Do eet!
That's not interesting at crypto scene, especially short term. People are making 10x like that every day (and losing as much)
"https://blockchain.info/charts/mempool-size?timespan=60days

Hahaha!!!
Actually, if we were to follow Blockstream argument that fee increases with price - if we were to honestly believe that logic, you'd be making profits, nice!
"Not to mention you might pay $20 to move 100k but at the same time 10000 other people pay $22 to move $100 and your 100k is now stuck for half a day.

Or the fact that lets say your LN transaction was based on a $10 fee, but when you need to close the channel the fee market is now at $20, so your channel can't close. LN needs an empty mempool to work."
Anyone who's had a transaction stuck since before the weekend is so lucky, it's gone up tremendously since then!

Until 3 days ago, the chart only went up to 600 sat, all the colors above that are new. on-chain innovation, right there.
good one
to give you a perspective, at the very peak you see in that graph, the total amount of fees that people paid for transactions *that didn't get confirmed* was 1.4 million USD. If you assume that one person had one or two transactions total that were stuck and that they paid at most $10 total for these transactions, that still means 140 thousand people were waiting for transactions to confirm that they paid dearly for. I assume that the actual amount of people waiting for transactions is way smaller, but that also means they paid a lot more..
"Also, OP is turning it into a joke by using the language of TA (Technical Analysis), a tool of traders.

They love drawing lines like this on price charts, which OP has lampooned quite well here."
Ah okay, for me it was just like a big graph colored draw a line straigh through it is abstract art :=D
The fact that it's trending upward means the fees are also trending upward. The more expensive it becomes, the harder it is for an average guy like me to purchase bitcoin. I can't buy $100 worth if $40 goes to paying transaction fees. 
The different colors are the different fees people are paying. The higher it is the more they pay
"It is the mempool size in tx-es, the yet unconfirmed transactions. The colours indicate the fee in sat/B paid for the tx. For bitcoin. There is a corresponding one for bitcoin cash. See https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#24h

The high fees is a result of low capacity, the mempool queue size is a result of the users surprise, it rises when there is an unexpected pressure from users (or a low block ~~time~~ frequency)."
"to put things into perspective an average transaction is ~250bytes.

250 * 800sat/byte * 0.00000001sat/btc = 0.002btc or 13$ at $6500 per btc.

Network is overloaded
This is no more absurd than the idea that one can predict the future behavior of market participants based on recent past behavior.
"The *mempool* is basically a holding tank for incoming transactions before being processed by the miners (confirming your transaction and 1000s of others in a block). This is just some memory on a node server with a default limit of 300mb. 

BTC doesn't have the capacity to handle the current amount of incoming transactions, so we are seeing this mempool get filled up with increasing fees (the color bands), which simply means it costs a lot and takes a very long time for your transaction to clear. 

If the network was operating correctly (no block size limitations), the mempool would clear out within every block or two. Cash is able to do this, BTC is not.

Its pretty much sarcasm. The OP is reading the mempool graph as if it were a price graph. Its good for a price graph to go up because that shows that the asset price is appreciating and going up in value and it would show bullishness. However, the OP is showing a picture of a MEMPOOL graph in which case its bad that it goes up because it means there are more transactions than there is space in blocks so fees are going up and transactions are not getting confirmed. Hope that helps.

"Hi ThePenster No. It is always cheaper because there is not so many that use that chain. The block site is 8 MB but even if the block size was only 0.4 MB manny block will not be full. And right now it is must cheaper then Bitcoin. Under more normal condition, where there is not so many forks that create Bitcoin traffic the Bitcoin mempool is still not so full and the fee is not so high. You can compare the Bitcoin fee and see that the Bitcoin fee is often OK. https://fork.lol/tx/fee

"No lol, it is 750 sat/B for bitcoin segwit right now, see https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/

For bitcoin cash it is practically 0, maybe 1 sat/B, some people pay just a bit more, don't know why. Most blocks clean the queue, but not always, it is up to the miner. Maybe you look at the wrong picture, here is the jochen hoenicke link for bitcoin cash: https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/cash/#24h Note also that the scale to the left is dynamic, the bitcoin cash queue is seldom more than 4000, and you can see that some blocks do not clean the queue."

"Absolutely nothing. 

Remember that the btc blockchain and the bcc/bch chain are completely separate. They are as different as Ethereum or Litecoin (a bitcoin fork itself). 

If you want to be 100 % safe move your btc to another address in the same wallet before using electron. Send it to yourself. Your btc and bcc will then be on different chains and different addresses. Overkill, but easy. 

Note that transactions are probably SLOW today. "
"Good to see Vitalik speaking out.  He's also spoken about the Bitcoin Cash censorship on /r/bitcoin: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uL9VoxCFqT0

It really is bizarre how censorship resistance and decentralization is the biggest selling point of cryptocurrencies but the most popular coin has some of the most centralized and censored communication channels."
Pretty much every other coin except BTC has super low fees.  
You gas price of 60 Gwei seems extremely high. It normally works well with a price of 1 Gwei. 
Thanks :)
That was before the metropolis update.
No, they hardforked because such a big part of the ETH in circulation would have been lost or in the hands of nefarious users that it was a problem for the entire currency. 
R/bitcoin considers everything an attack and won't allow other trains of thought.  getting downvoted for name calling and retarded statements doesn't mean its a censored forum.  
No, on /r/Bitcoin you would have been perma-banned.
"Chain rollback, lesser hashrate and unrestricted supply. Ethereum has its own niche and it isn't sound money, Bitcoin Cash is

You're literally retarded. Just because someone develops a program and works on it doesn't mean they're directing what happens with those programs, Ethereum is a great example of decentralization.
"Centralized will always outperform decentralized because it takes entrepreneurs risking their time, capital and reputations to make things happen. Equivocating eth with something like fiat just because a figurehead exists is fallacious because Western civilization got to where it is today by the musings of renaissance men and entrepreneurs and the organizations built around them to deliver their ideas to the masses. 

Semi centralized chains are ok as long they’re voluntary. ETH doesn’t put a gun to your head and you are not bound by the “social contract” to use it. 

"

And there some form of redistribution still exists. More importantly people with guns are being fed hierarchically on nation scale. Open blockchains revolution will be nothing like anyone ever saw
Where do you get this shit from? The world is at peace moreso than it has ever been. There's hardly any real war. All crimes in all countries are in decline. Stop your doomsday fantasy,
I can't even oversimplify. It quickly becomes a wall of text. Read about central banking, taxation, Greshem's law, how many people even in 1st world have savings and how many - debts. Open blockchains will lead to the greatest wealth inequality
I would also like to know more of the tax bit. Having only lived in countries with tax that covers healthcare and other things to make society more equal.
"Yes, they will. How u are going to collect taxes from me? From millions of people? My transaction history always will be invisible to any state cos no one has manpower to do such graph analysis simply cos cost of traceability reduction is cheaper than cost of analyzing enlarged graph

Nobody won't be able to connect money to anyone as tech develops. Complete opposition to modern banking. Read about foundation of IRS, without FED it'd be impossible"
Yeah all the 90+ companies are centralised... Idiot
I know, it truly could have been the programmable money we we're all promised.

That was the original plan. Mastercoin, eth, etc. Imagine the value of bitcoin if it was allowed to scale, if it was allowed to host innovative projects, if it wasn't being smothered in the crib.

Can you elaborate on the end of total taxation? It sounds like you're suggestion cryptos will end taxation. 
Look up Ethereum Enterprise Alliance. ETH is a centralized project with figurehead Vitalik in charge. Why is that okay but Blockstream isn't? Neither should be. This sub should be supporting the likes of [ETC](https://ethereumclassic.github.io/blog/2016-07-15-start-project/), who went through the exact same thing as BCH did, not ETH's bullshit.
Please /u/insette. A medium post will do. That's insane, I didn't know this.
"Well we can agree that simple money is not Ethereum's niche, and I hope that Bitcoin Cash can restore the ability of Bitcoin to fill that niche. Some corrections though, since I think Ethereum provides stiff competition just in terms of implementing money:

* There has never been a chain rollback on Ethereum (hopefully it is never necessary). The idea is not at all popular among the community either. There have been at least two in Bitcoin.
* Hashrate is not directly comparable since the PoW algorithm is different. Ethereum has plenty of hash power to be secure however, and since GPUs are still profitable, mining equipment manufacturing is less centralised.
* If you want restricted supply on Ethereum, you can make your own coin on it without reinventing the blockchain.
* Ethereum has much much faster block times (12s vs 15 minutes) and more transaction capacity than Bitcoin. It stores the current state more efficiently because nodes can directly store the current state instead of the UTXO model which becomes unnecessarily complex over time."

"I will decide what I do with it. Maybe I will, Maybe I won't. But the point is, you don't get a choice. When the government collects taxes, it is not a consensual transaction. I personally feel that all transactions between people should be voluntary and not through coercion.

If you want all those services, why dont you pay for them yourself? Why do you think that it is beneficial to involve a middle man for you to get those services? The government is just redistributing wealth and they are inefficient at it. It leads to crony capitalism and corruption."

Your assuming that taxes make things more equal. If it is morally wrong for me to take your money from you by force, why is it ok that the government does so? If something is wrong on an individual level, doing the same action collectively does not make it right. 
"There are no countries where tax has made things more equal. Inequality of wealth has risen all over the world in the past 50 years. You're confusing a global increase in living standards with an increase in equality. The current state of Western Europe is inching closer to communism: lower classes share the same possibilities, but the ceiling between them and upper classes is increasingly thick, and breaking through it increasingly requires political favor over merit.


There is a case to be made communism and inequality aren't so bad if basic living standards are high enough, but equality it ain't."
"Rollback happened and Classic was born. C'mon, man, stop gaslighting. Immutable ledger means that all hacks and steals can be fought only outside blockchain. Ethereum is good for smart contracts and has its own niche

I already have plenty of Bitcoin Cash. Create competition, achieve PoW security of EHs/s and convince me to switch after that"
i haven't used metamask personally, but according to [this guy](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/16609/is-there-any-gui-ethereum-wallet-that-lets-you-manually-set-gas-price) it should be editable when you initiate a transaction, hopefully you can save lots in transaction fees now :)
I don't have the screen in front of me, but normally, when confirming a transaction, you can choose the gas limit (maximum amount of gas that will be used), and the gas price (price that you are willing to pay per unit of gas). I think that the minimum price you can put in metamask is 0.1 Gwei.
No it doesn't because eth devs corrected the fee price, core devs did not.
Good bot

"What is the difference between armed robbery and the government collecting taxes? In both cases your freedom is being threatened unless you pay. I understand how taxes work everywhere. It is morally wrong to take someones money forcefully. You say ""free"" education, ""free"" healthcare, but how is it free? You are paying indirectly through taxes. 

>And there is no way I would ever change my mind on that.

This is not a good attitude to have. Always have an open mind. I used to be of the belief that taxes were for the good of everyone in society as well. The more I learned about how government operates, the wasteful spending on wars all over the world funded by our tax dollars, the preferential treatment that is given to big business and corporations that have politicians in their back pockets, the more I came to the understanding of what taxes really were doing. I have also read a lot on economics and when people have to voluntary enter into transactions with each other, both sides are better off or else they wouldn't perform that transaction. The free market is better able to provide the goods and services that you need than the government is. "
"The OP_RETURN wars really deserve a revisit. I consider the actions of Greg Maxwell and the usual suspects here as ""Intolerable Acts"": deep injustices which can never be forgiven.

At Counterparty.io, we tried everything under the sun to get the usual suspects of Bitcoin to see why what we were doing was critically important to Bitcoin's continued relevance, but we were constantly labeled spammers, ""altcoin scammers"", and parasites ([literal word choice](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=395761.msg6162434;topicseen#msg6162434)).

They simply would not listen to reason. No amount of evidence could convince them to embrace embedded ledger technology like Counterparty.io.

Of course it quickly came to light the core developers of Bitcoin had cofounded the Blockstream company, had taken *equity in Blockstream*, and planned on launching *sidechains* as the ultimate smart contract solution for Bitcoin. We would later learn sidechains were to become Blockstream's #1 claim to fame, and that those plans had long since been put into action.

I've summarized the many grievances at play there in considerable detail on /r/Decred, a coin which I have chosen to involve myself in solely due to the Intolerable Acts carried out by the current Bitcoin Core developers in the OP_RETURN wars, acts which led directly to the rise of ETH to 90% of BTC's market cap: acts which can never be forgiven or forgotten.

In fact, even though I support what Bitcoin Cash is doing, I have trouble shilling the coin simply because I know it acts as an effective *bailout* for the Blockstream/Core developer team, a team which deserves nothing less than dying broke and penniless for systematically discriminating against Counterparty, causing our project and the Bitcoin project itself BILLIONS of dollars in damage due to lost opportunities, not to mention incalculable brand damage and brain drain."
"This line of argument just doesn't stack up. Ethereum has maintained functional money (storing ETH with a private key/address in the same way as you would in Bitcoin) since its first public release, with no significant bugs. This is in contrast to Bitcoin, which suffered [a consensus bug](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcoin-network-shaken-by-blockchain-fork-1363144448/) where the cleanup required rolling back transactions on one of the forks.

The only things that fell down on Ethereum were more complex applications that Bitcoin has no ability to do (perhaps thanks to OP_RETURN being censored, idk). The DAO for example was a decentralised democratic venture capital firm. Yes Ethereum hard forked to avoid the fallout of that, but at no time was there a significant failure in the basic features it has in common with Bitcoin. It's like claiming that a F1 car is unsafe because one time the driver crashed it at 350km/h and then had an embarrassing black eye.

The only real failure Ethereum had as a currency was once for about one week there was a wait of about a day to get transactions to clear. When you compare that to Bitcoin Core... that one week of congestion is the standard situation. It didn't just break once, its almost permanently useless."
"The smartest mathematicians of the world wrote whole books on it. No, I can't just explain it an a comment. I lack intelligence to do so. I recommend u to read books

Well, I can try: like water flows downhill, economic activity always will flow in the systems **with least friction**. Economic activity, collective market won't notice burned wealth and death of others. It's absolutely immoral flow, like flow of water. Currently Bitcoin Cash has almost the least friction amongst all other payment systems and it's the second most secure ledger in the world. From economic activity store of value arises"

"If you've been in r/bitcoin since 2013 or earlier, you will see how r/bitcoin has changed overtime. The censorship became worse and worse. Instead of new ideas and open discussions, it was just all about price and how great bitcoin is. One can't even say the word Ethereum so people referred to it as ""the E word"".

"You are confusing merchant adoption with merchant switching. There isn't nearly as much friction to changing to 100% api compatible but different node software than when trying to accept crypto for the first time.

And once bitpay or coinbase switches or add BCH support it will flow through automatically to all their merchants. Not nearly as hard as getting those merchants in the first place."
Fuck Vitalik and Ethereum. That shit is as centralized as it gets, no better than Core/Blockstream. Vitalik engages in Theymos level censorship. Get your head out of your ass. 
He is a clown supports censorship.

Not sure why the downvotes. Possibly because you mention game theory two too many times.
It’s so refreshing to come to a forum where people truly understand and accept what is coming. Thank you for speaking about it. 
But fees on eth have gone above 0.20 usd, so his point is moot
Why doesn't this subreddit speak out about the scam that's known as CSW (which Vitalik has done)? It's sure nice to have double standards.
Vitalik is a more and more a political clown. a pawn manipulated by people around him.
Dude is  so overrated.  I’d like to see him stop bitching about other coins and fix his own coin’s shitty transaction rate for once. 
"Or even 5 cents. The thing for the Cashening is, merchants and consumers (darknet, gamblers, VPN services, etc.) have to *run into problems doing the thing they need to do* in order for them to consider switching. The guy buying his weed needs to think, ""Man, is it really gonna take a $20 fee for this $200 order? Well I can try $5 and wait til tomorrow. And heck even $20 is fine I guess, could just order more at a time. Not like I have a choice, and maybe this is only temporary.""   That's four ways he can adjust and not be concerned enough to figure out what BCH is. Some vendors will probably now be thinking about how the fees are cutting into their bottom line, but maybe they are making enough anyway. Gamblers? OK, fees are a big problem on a platform like SatoshiDice, but on  centralized site where you fund all at once, a $20 one-time fee isn't that painful. At least not enough to switch. The site might consider switching, but they're making bank and so the inertia can be heavy. Everyday merchants? Maybe, but bootstrapping a network effect is hard, and almost no one can be using BTC to pay for things so they probably aren't feeling optimistic. 

We have to re-inspire all those services like VPNs and porn sites and marketplaces. The price rise helps BCH be taken seriously, but it must be followed by massive action on getting the economy going or it won't last. High fees on BTC killed so much; it won't just automatically come back just because fees are low on BCH. And fees can still go higher on BTC while people just deal with it in a lot of the commerce situations, since many are not that fee-sensitive. I think the point where it just becomes impossible is $50 fees."
When you begin to see someone like Vitalik speak on the condition of Bitcoin you know the truth has triumphed.
"Vitalik is a professional and and a gentleman. He has always tried to be diplomatic and just busied himself with his own project. 

And yet even he can't hide how he feels about BTC devs anymore. "
I wouldn't have thought so either. But...here we are. 
I moved some BCH today... paid half a cent fee.
"Even smartest people don't look deep enough into game theory. I was absolutely sure that Bitcoin Cash will overtake the network since August 1st, but I didn't foresee that wealth transfer can occur that fast 

It's a very valuable lesson of game theory, the **exact same thing** is going to happen with fiat/crypto in coming years or a couple of decades max. Total calmness, some news, some actions, total panic (in the first time of history across the globe, everywhere), fires and wars. Prepare

Edit: Cyprus crisis and Bitcoin's price uprising back then was a smallest glimpse at things to come"
"> this willingness to compromise protocol immutability to achieve a desired outcome in a particular application (hmm, sound familiar?)

Can anyone enlighten me what he meant by this parenthetical, with regard to OP_RETURN?"
Today I wanted to donate to a site that only accepts BTC, and the fees scared me away from doing so.
All of these top comments are trying to push bitcoin cash so hard. 
As someone who is a believer in Ethereum, holy shit you guys are pretty fucking level headed. Can someone explain why it’s actually pretty ok on this subreddit but over on /r/bitcoin they are incredibly defensive?
"I've never received or sold BCH, could someone tell me how much BCH takes in fees.

"
I had one of my comments removed from r/bitcoin today. This is not my original account, but I have been a contributor there for over 4 years. The mistake I made was describing $5-$10 fees as a failure.
Public blockchains without fees are a scam
Brave, he could have kept his mouth shut and avoid a ton of criticism and attacks he is going to get.
Vitalik says some good things but beware of attempts to lionize him, he's not in the camp.
This is so funny.  Don’t you think Vitalik has a reason to see the real Bitcoin fall.  Enough with this fake Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash bull.  It’s already tanking.  You better hope you can sell your Bitcoin cash before it tanks too far.  Seems like this plan has tied things up.  Hopefully people didn’t buy in past $1000 because your in for a long ride down and if you can’t sell it, your stuck.
I wonder how much Vitalik has invested in Bitcoin?
Just imagine Eth's usecase built into Bitcoin proper.
Can you please explain game theory to me in this context? I am unfamiliar with it. :/
[removed]
There were lots of developers using OP_RETURN to build projects on top of the Bitcoin blockchain (e.g. colored coins). But the Core devs didn't like this, so they essentially rendered it useless by reducing it's size by 50%, driving tons of developers away (including Vitalik when he was starting his project)
Exactly.  All technical discussion aside, if there are two sides to an argument and one side won't even let me hear the opposing viewpoint, I can be 99% sure that their side is wrong.  Because any decent argument should be able to withstand knowledge of its opposing viewpoint.
"Strange thing about fees is: They are socially unjust ... 10$ fee is nothing for a 10.000$ transaction, but a lot for a 100$ transaction, so it hits the poor. And in my view, it hits also the population of the poor countries (90%) on our earth. They could need bitcoin more than us, they fight against currencies with high inflation rates ... 
... I really don't think, that was the vision of satoshi."
"That is true, but it's still a jump that they have to go through several stages of awareness to reach, which may put a natural limit on the speed of the Cashening. At least it may not happen as fast as yesterday's meteoric rise suggested.

Linchpins like Bitpay and Coinbase are of course key for getting a whole bunch of people on board, but there may be a bit of a chicken or egg problem there, too. Are any of their merchants pushing for them to adopt BCH? At least one big headline use, like overstock.com / newegg.com or a major darknet market or popular domain registrar / VPN or a big gambling site may be necessary to have so that people can at least point to something to spend the ""magic internet tokens"" on."
No, they are less than a penny.

They are becoming comparable to JP Morgan and Fox News.  The level of censorship is astonishing.  There will be a few flips of price and hash power between BTC and BCH it looks like.  Problem for BTC is if BCH holds majority hash power and price get closing to flipping BCH > BTC there is no coming back for BTC.  BCH is chomping at the bit(coin) and once it succeeds it is game over.  The reasons BTC is failing will not be the same for BCH once it reigns.

"8mb is big enough for right now. Over time it is supposed to keep going up. Satoshi wrote about it and planned for it to increase over time. 

1 GB is too big for right now. At our current internet speeds, with millions of nodes around the world, if a miner discovered a block, by the time this gets propagated to the entire network, many others will have found a block as well. Hence the block chain diverges. It doesnt make sense at our current transfer speeds. 

As our internet speeds increase and if our transactions are increasing to a point that it requires increases to the block size then it makes sense. "
it's real. Google Mike Hearn or Gavin Andresen and read their blogs.
People will give you their biased answers depending on where you ask the question. I’d say look where the money flows and who it benefits. Seems to me lately the ones who yell the loudest have the most to gain. Imagine being an early adopter in bitcoin and then an even bigger adopter in bitcoin cash. 
i have no idea, but i think so because bitcoin cash is interested in developing satoshi's vision, whereas bitcoin is interested in developing the vision of a guy who originally said he proved bitcoin mathematically impossible. How can you prove it to be impossible and then suddenly become the lead dev of it?
"Exactly...it's this and the fact that really the BCH solution is a sort of temporary solution that stops me from ""jumping trains"".  I have to stay on both for now.  I dislike the core devs at this point but I feel BCH is not necessarily an angel either especially with this pump..."

Blockstream.

BTC has already been hijacked.  BCH aims to make things right and take bitcoin back from Blockstream.  BCH dev teams are looking for alternative layer 2 solutions that don't involve singular companies that would look to profit off btc transactions."
"There is work to ""compress"" the blocks (since all nodes get all the transactions anyway).

The way Bitcoin originally worked, all the data would be sent twice: once as individual transactions, then another time as a completed block.  Now Bitcoin just sends the list of transaction hashes when a new block is found.

Bitcoin was always intended to scale up to [multi-gigabyte blocks](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability#Scalability_targets). The Lightning network may be useful for micro-transactions (less than $1), but won't be ready for a few years.

And if you want to hurt BTC transact with it.  That backlog is a bitch. (not serious, I think...)"
"so why did the consensus decide ""Core"" should be the rightful committers of bitcoin legacy?"
"For me, these appear to be symptoms of the fundamental flaw of bitcoin. I mean, originally, it was simple. A digital currency that will be mined until a maximum, and whose mining will be controlled by computing power required to mine, essentially. 

My understanding may be a bit crude and incomplete, but from what i can tell, the currency can have value, because every transaction is checked and verified through a network. Each transaction I believe must carry some sort of history or something like that as part of the legitimacy process. This means that every transaction gets harder and harder to process, the same way that mining gets harder to do. This is a big fundamental problem, since the more transactions you make, the longer it takes to process them to the point it becomes unusable. 

I dont fully understand all of this segwit and bitcoin cash, and and all of that, but if im not mistaken, these forks are desined to alleviate this problem.  but then you end up with multiple different sorts of coin. And I think the probpem will just come back again later.

I may have misunderstood some of that, idk.

"BCH teams have removed the insecure RBF, avoided segwit (that was put in place to line Lightning Network pockets, not to make btc better) and have been testing larger block sizes to find a better solution to scaling than segwit/LN.  They successfully ran 1GB block which shows it can scale much, much larger than just 1MB.  Now they can work a more exposed and thought out problem than sweeping the truth under the carpet, claiming ""1MB is as big as it can ever be!"""
bitcoin cash is shit the only reason they fork is because of their ASIC mining hardware will not have an advantage after segwit comes in and after the lightning network. Bitcoin is also kinda shit imo, to me any PoW coin is shit because the amount of electricity that goes to waste just to send bytes over the internet.

My guess is that BCH will by nature of economics naturally overtake BTC.
Most of the great use cases for Bitcoin are for it's use as a transnational cash system. 

BTC now fails at this endeavor. 
BCH has the bitcoin name, but also the spirit of being low transaction fees and speedy transactions.

We need to start helping vendors get into the using BCH. Getting people transacting in BCH. It will naturally grow the coin and the pie for both BCH and BTC.

Maybe we should each try and find a friend.

I believe they had a larger block size but it was constantly being filled with spam, so they limited it to 1MB.  The Bitcoin white paper mentions that the block size can (and should?) grow, but core (Blockstream) ignores that and uses the backup as propaganda to push their segwit/Lightning Network solution that puts money into Blockstream's pockets, eventually.

David Gerard wrote the only book on the subject that you need to read.
These last few days it wasn't because of a difficulty adjustment on Bitcoin Cash, it was because of the price increase.
It's optional.
"Emergency Difficulty Adjustment; an addition to the legacy difficulty adjustment algorithm meant to make Bitcoin Cash survive significant loss of hashpower without needing to spend many months with extremely slow blocks.

It's a blunt tool that sometimes overcorrects and makes things too easy, attracting lots of miners back right after too many miners move away; we're upgrading the difficulty adjustment system this monday to make it work even better."
">fork.lol is incorrect, it cannot rise 400%. The max single adjustment is 4x: -75% to +300%.


100% + 300% = 400%

[Whether you should say 300% or 400% depends on how you phrase things; it's an increase of 300%, and the new difficulty will be 400% of the previous.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage#Percentage_increase_and_decrease)

It displays most data with averages, not just the last value.
We're getting something better tomorrow.
Has a 51% attack been observed? I suspect many alt coins with low hash power are very susceptible to this. I suspect the odds of a 51% attack are exceedingly low. Especially if said attackers are traceable somehow. I see many miners and pools are specifically identified in charts. Even if they don't broadcast their name, it probably wouldn't take much to deduce what miners mysteriously disappeared from other mining during that time.
"It's always possible; but the more honest hashpower a chain got, the more expensive it is to perform a 51% attack."
"[Centralization is just means to an end, the real goal is censorship resistance](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7c59cy/charlie_lee_criticism_of_bitcoin_cash_are_they/dpos62w/).

[And block size increase isn't gonna make centralization much worse anyway](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/76u07x/small_miners_who_might_be_hurt_by_larger_blocks/)."
"Makes the chain more secure; the more honest hashpower the chain got, the more expensive it is to roll back transactions (what's commonly known as a ""51% attack"")."

We're gonna get something better than the original algorithm tomorrow.
"I read 6.84/10.86 = 62.9%, so what on Earth are you talking about?

One of the still active Core devs was responsible for a 51% attack against an altcoin some years ago.
"The legacy DAA doesn't adjust fast enough; the same would happen to the Core chain if the situation was reversed. The EDA only goes downward.

But that's alright, we're ditching both the EDA and the legacy DAA on monday for a new and improved DAA."

I follow your conversation with the other poster to this very end, I'd like to say that I really appreciate what you write.

Maybe the other poster is indeed a troll, or maybe they aren't, who knows, but your continued replies to them are beneficial to me.

I'm currently learning about BTC and BCH, and it's especially hard to me because coinbase aren't open to my country of residence.

Cex.io and Coinmama takes forever for verification (not their fault, it's the combination of this country's infrastructure fault, and my fault for not following instruction to the letter), and bitstamp just means I need to use bank transfer which takes days.

So, while all this is going on, I check out some local places and managed to buy a couple dollars worth of BCH finally. I think I'll be in it for the long run, and am currently on level 0 on learning.

Welp, my post went on a tangent, but I'd like to let you know that your effort was not in vain because at least there is another stranger reading it at this very moment.

Thanks!"
"Oh hi, I'm still reading the replies to that thread.

Thanks for the tip. I've read enough for the past day to know that the tip thing is real money, so thanks for the generosity!

I don't know how to claim that yet, but I'll figure out how to take that several hours from now when I'm on my reading break. I'm still engrossed on reading all the information my brain can take, so I can parse them and eventually make beginners questions about it."
"Yeah, I have a BCH wallet address created by the local exchange where I managed to wrangle a couple dollars of BCH. (But I haven't managed to get a separate wallet outside of said exchange yet)

"The most common method for off chain transactions are at exchanges.  It is very common for an exchange to limit who can participate and in what capacity.  In some cases, a country will be so controlling that they will shut down the exchanges. 

Most newer proposals that I am familiar with for off chain transactions require participating in an off chain distributed network.  If you wanted to transact with another, you'd need to find a node on the network for which both have account balances in place.  Larger nodes would have more accounts.  My concern is that said nodes can implement whatever policies they want in regards to who is able to participate.  I don't like my money being subject to the whims of any controlling agency.  On the flip side, I can understand why these control points are useful for establishing control.    It helps the good guys catch/control the bad guys.  The problem that arises is that my definition of good/bad guys might not match yours.

If you use the 2h view on https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#24h, you can actually see that the big chunk of green at the top **right now** is 800-1000 sat/byte."
not mention dying of thirst while your transaction confirms ... because, as we all know, zero-conf transactions are dangerous 
Turn with the wind? There were two years of debate that lead up to the bch/btc split. It wasn't a lightly made decision. 
If you don't know the history, should you be allowed to post opinions about it?
What you dont understand is that bitcoin cash is a version of bitcoin. The bitcoin community split, big blockers and small blockers. Bitcoin cash is bitcoin with bigger blocks. We’re scaling according to the original scaling plan. BCH and BTC are sister chains. 
r/btc was formed long before the fork, as everyone knows. It is you that is being deceptive now.
I hold both coins equally (as does anyone else who bought before Aug 1st and simply did nothing, which I'm virtually certain is the majority of worldwide holders), so i like to discuss both BTC and BCH, and they're inextricably linked no matter how much anyone wants to pretend they aren't. This is the only sub where I can have that discussion, unfortunately.
hence my words:  on bcash' level, silly! try again :0
The mass is using the bitcoin by many years? You must live on another planet then... go out, stop the first person you find and ask them what's the Bitcoin, then be surprised of their answers.
It won't happen anymore because the hash power will remain on the Bitcoin from now on.
"""Probably""? In your opinion the Bitcoin developers will just sit there waiting for it to die... and doing nothing. Does it looks like plausible to you?"
"51% attack IS a fact... if you ask the dense BCH supporters about this issue, they will tell you that the miners can be trusted (!) ...yes you read it right. After years of technology and cryptography, the security of your money is hanging on the integrity of a miner. Isn't it fun?

That's why It is important that the hash power is adequately shared between multiple entities.
"
"A single miner having the majority of the hash power is a ""joke"" for you? Interesting pow."
I agree 100%.  I actually sold my BCH after the fork initially, then I bought more back when I realized BCH is the bitcoin I've wanted/used all these years...  At this point these people seem like they're betting on a sports team and they want theirs to win, with zero regard as to utility or community.  Seems like a big propaganda campaign/smear.
"Just look at the time history of the mem pool over the last three months [here](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#3m)

Why is the mempool empty for weeks at a time and then spikes. No it isn't because bitcoin adoption has gone bonkers in the last four weeks. "
"Well, don't create solution that market will reject. :D

Even worse, don't try to force that solution on the market by keeping them hostage. Eventually market will abandon you."
"How serious of a threat do you consider a 51% attack?

Put your money where your mouth is. I am willing to bet that 51% attack will not happen within the next year. What odds do you want?"
"The Bitcoin has been designed this way. If you decide to fork from it, it's supposed that you planned to have miners support, or you must adopt another technology.

BCH forked from the Bitcoin without having any miner support, and see what happened, they had to ""invent"" the EDA (promoting to be the ""original"" Bitcoin vision and then add a broken system to adjust the difficulty.. that's pretty ironic), that is the only reason of why we had the (former) Bitcoin miners aboard: they was exploiting it for a profit. Now it's being fixed, and all of them will switch back.

It's not the community that should do ""something"", it's this fork that should never existed, or it should have planned carefully not from a day to another as the result of madness and impulsiveness."
The fat that IT CAN happen is already a good reason to raise some questions.. instead of just ignore the problem.
"I agree they should have increased the block size, but only as a PR move, not as a necessity for bitcoin right now. 

It is bad PR and bad for marketing that core has not caved at all on this issue. But I think had they caved, the mempool would still get spammed at whatever size it was today. So bottom line what really matters is that their evil side chain plan needs to get implemented as fast as possible. I am skeptical. 

"
Well as it stands right now, it just sounds like miners are big assholes. Hopefully they don't piss everyone off to the point that the market abandons them and their expensive ASICs become useless
One Bitcoin Cash's DAA kicks in, the time-stamping services using it will be more precise (within 1 hour).
lol Enjoy watching your bcash die and destroy lots of peoples confidence in cryptocurrency. cheers mate.
"Reply. Yes, it is wrong. You would have needed 900sat/byte during the time of one block per hour, where the network was highly overloaded. The fee estimation does not take into account that load is now severely reduced due to increased blockrate.

This is also the reason why there are still 900sat/byte transactions on the queue. They use outdated fee estimations. The only thing interesting in that chart is the lowest band that gets completely reduced to 0 transactions within a few blocks. This is what you should look at.

Any other logic would yield 600sat/byte for bcash as well:

https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/cash/#2h

>(10 transactions with 600 sat/byte or more atm @ bch, or ~0.4% of pending transactions)

>(425 transactions with 900 sat/byte or more atm @ btc, or ~0.4% of pending transactions)
"
"> So https://bitcoinfees.info is wrong? I'm seeing 900sat/byte on the table for 1-3 block conf.


You have to actually look at the orderbook (fee market) and understand how it's trending. 

We only spiked up to 1000 sat\byte yesterday because BCH had a majority of the hashpower because the difficulty adjustment. BTC had 30 minute blocks. That caused a HUGE backup and fees to spike as a result. 

Now miners have returned after the difficulty adjustment (and price decline); so block timing is returning to normal. 

https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/

You can see here that the market is quite thin up until you hit the 750 and 500 sat\byte levels. You need to think of the fee market as a ton of ""bids"", of which when a block is mined, the miners ""market sell"" into it clearing the top layer of best bids. So the ""average"" may be high because a lot of wallet software uses moving averages to calculate fees which doesn't necessarily take into account actual bid depth that you would expect to get a tx confirmed at. 

Welcome to a fee market. It's a pain in the ass and not really necessary currently, but it works. 
"
Okay, I don't know much about that debate. Why were you opposed to segwit and lightening? 
Maybe not, but then this sub would be empty. 
Everyone can hard fork from btc, all you do is copy btc code and go your merry way. Bigger blocks only temporarily solve the scaling problem. Bitcoin cash was baptized bch, why try and steal your sisters name? Do you hate your sister that much that you want her dead? How's that constructive, let alone sane? 
"Same. I’ve been hodling for some time now. Lots of popcorn has been made ready to keep my hands occupied during the drops.

... yes, low wait times and low fees are bcash, as the link you provided proved. I don't understand what you're implying?
"You just used the term ""mass"" which I have never mentioned. Even then, if you ask a random person on the street about Bitcoin they are not gonna say ""It's a store of value!"". Most people probably don't even know what Bitcoin is.

Do you even know why Bitcoin has value in the first place? Because in was traded for things. The first thing that was bought with Bitcoin was a Pizza which decided the price for Bitcoin, then it was used on black markets which drove up the demand. Please do some research first."
Sure, apart from [all the times it happened before, including before BCash forked](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#all).
They *are* doing nothing in this current shitshow caused by the high fees and delays. Indeed. 
This is true, but what can we, as a community do about it? Or the developers for that matter. Again this is not an inherit flaw in BCH itself. Just because one big miner decides to stand with BCH no matter what so that he bevomes the 50% when the others leave is unfortunate, but there's nothing anyone can do about it for now. The same thing could just as well happen to BTC, so while it's bad, it's not something that should be held against BCH out of principle.
"“Cannot chase every attack vector”

Dude, this scaling debate is dragging from 2014. All they had to do was to increase block for 1Mb. What are you talking about? This is bitcoin prevented to scale BY DESIGN.

Look at average tax fees all time and you’ll see what I’m talking about. BitCoin had 0,01-0,03 fees for years before 2017"
"There's nothing that should be done today. It's not that they will listen at some hysterical posts on this sub to decide when it's time to do ""something"". Upgrades will come, with plans and calm."
Bitcoin probably has 100 attack vectors. It is nothing more than accounting and basic prioritization that makes you realize that the core team cannot chase every attack vector. You are wrong about this thing lasting a year now. Just a few weeks ago the mempool was completely empty. It stays that way until it is attacked. 
You got downvoted for speaking the truth (new DAA algorithm in a few hours).  It's amazing how much people are invested in suppressing either side, based on their financial position/holdings.  It's a shame the truth isn't priority #1.
"LN will open its door in 18 months MINIMUM, and then adoption will take who knows how long.

If bitcoin scales, it will win. If it doesn't, it will be replaced.

Bitcoin doesn't get to continue to be the majority coin if it can't be used. That's not how reality works. Bitcoin Cash has an advantage over coins like litecoin because the majority of Bitcoin holders hold Cash as well, and every single miner can freely choose to migrate giving Bitcoin Cash the same security system already built for Bitcoin.

Imagine how much easier Facebook could steal MySpace's customers, if they just imported all the MySpace accounts into their system. That's the situation Bitcoin Cash is in.

Next block conf is about at 900sat/byte right now. The delusion is strong.
Exactly, all the rbitcoin talk of reaching $10,000 by end of 2017, it could've been that already if not for Cores bullshit developing. 
It's almost as if their business plan doesn't factor in new users and they are actually trying to cripple bitcoin.
"None of the core developers have had any foresight, Adam Back, Blockstream CEO, ignored bitcoin for years despite being mentioned in the white paper and being contacted by Satoshi before release of Bitcoin and only bought when it was at a 2013 high just beige the 2 year bear market. 

Greg Maxwell, Blockstream CTO, claimed he had proven that decentralisation was impossible in bitcoin and is now spouting decentralisation is the only way forward ignoring the fact Core is a centralised developer team. 

Samson Mow, Blockstream CSO, after releasing the Blockstream Satellite (useless) then posted a photo with the caption about some man being stranded in the Sahara and then using the satellite to buy some water with bitcoin from a local villager, forgetting the Sahara was literally the only place in the world the satellite didn't cover. 

These are just incompetent dickheads who have forced their way into power and have ruined the BTC chain. Now the real innovation is in BCH. "
"The latest pile-on of hash-power was not triggered by the EDA: the price of BCH Quadrupled in the space of a few days.

This made it much more profitable to mine.
"
">Imo, BTC can't survive that long as no1 crypto with 5$+ fees. Also, what stops BCH to implement LN (and even segwit) if technology proves to be any good as it is advertised.

I'm not debating whether BTC or BCH is better or which one will win. They are both pretty shit at being a currency without LN or some other scaling solution. So I guess as it stands right now, the only reason that BTC/BCH have value is because of the brand recognition.

>But given the fact that they promised that ""Segwit will instantly double chain capacity"" and they didn't deliver anything near that 6 months from its activation makes you think why would you believe anything they say...

Isn't it because wallets haven't adopted Segwit yet? Segwit is up and running, but people are simply not using it yet. "
"What do you mean ""BTC doesn't have to be immune to every conceivable attack"" ? o.O

And your second argument is implying a 51% attack? That's a fucking joke.

>You also seems to ignore the importance of the hash rate related to the security of the transactions

If these are your best arguments, I think I'll stick with BCH."
"Well if they own old BTC, they own the equivalent amount of BCH, so I don't see what the problem is? BTCs value would migrate to BCH, and because BCH is usable as a currency, its value should go up higher than BTCs.

The only problem I see if they sold their BCH after the August 1st fork because they perceived it as free money and not as a free hedge. Well then they have no one else to blame but themselves I guess."

"When you begin with a lie ""/r/btc"", how can you have honest discussion? "
"Proof that you don't understand what you're talking about.

Just because someone chose to pay $7 USD per KB (likely a typo), doesn't mean it's required. The proof is that there's only 4 transactions in the entire block you linked, and the total block size is 18.896 KB (0.24% of the maximum allowed). They could have paid a 0.70USD transaction fee per KB (you know, like the one in the exact same block you linked), and still had it confirmed.

So yea, fake news, try again."
"Well said. Too many people here self-importantly project their vision of what crypto ""should"" be used for. It's not for anyone to decide how others use their crypto."
">When the market (and the mass) will be ready to really use it as a ""coin"", it will adapt. Today is OK as it is.

What the fuck are you talking about? People did use Bitcoin as a coin for many years but since there is no scaling happening, the capacity didn't allow for it at some point. Do you know how many stores used to have Bitcoin but then removed it from their payment options because of fees and wait time? You have so little knowledge about Bitcoin that I really cannot take your opinions seriously."
If the transaction queue of almost 200k isn't signalling that the market wants something, I donno what is
"The point is that blocks will be found every 10 min consistently on the BCH chain but with much greater capacity. As for BTC, nothing is being fixed and probably never will.

"
This is the biggest thing people like to point out, but what do you expect we can do about this? This is not a problem with BCH in itself. I'd love to hear your proposal for this.
Actually I didn't really deny that it is spammed. I'm looking at the mempool all the time but I can't see something suspicious there, what should I look out for? Also are you aware that less blocks than usual have been mined for Bitcion recently?
Occasionally, and never caused any issue. It's not that you need your Bitcoin to be transferred in 10 minutes or you'll die. People are used to use the banks, 2 hours for them is already something coming out from a Sci-Fi movie.

Does not sound like you are over it. Work on that. 
And it certainly won't happen if transaction fees are 4 euros and wait times are 3 hours.

"No, I'm not twisting words. Here's your original statement.

>[BTC] fees nor the slowness is an issue at the moment. On the other side the BCH network is struggling

You downplay fees and slowness of BTC which is a very real problem and go on to emphisize how the ""BCH network is struggling"".

You know that BTCs problems will persist and BCH will be fixing their shit in literally a couple hours. As for the 51% attack, considering you didn't take me up on my bet - I will assume that you don't think this is a real problem either. Nearly all your statements were completely disingenuous."
"The point is if you can't do enough basic research to get the name right, nobody should trust a thing you say.

As in bitcoin ***is not for you***, it's not user friendly, you have to do your own homework, it's not optional.

Nobody is doing you favors letting you pretend you know what you are talking about, instead of teaching you how to learn starting with getting the name right.

Maybe when you can get past the starting line on your own without tripping and crying about it and carried over by someone else, I will take you seriously.

"BTC ""problems"" (as you call it) will persist until they will be fixed, at the moment they aren't a big issue.

I mentioned a problem that is affecting the BCH by its fork day, to evidence that problems exists everywhere, it will be fixed today, but it will generate another (bigger) problem: the migration of all the miners to the Bitcoin, exposing the BCH to a higher risk.

Not having your transaction going in for 3 hours is an annoyance, having your transaction manipulated maliciously by a miner that own the majority of the hash power is something different. It is a real problem, it's not just a theory."
"I didn't ask you to prove anything. You were creating a strawman argument so I pressed you on it. 

You were basically saying the BTC's perpetual logjam of transactions is as concerning as the temporary backlog of BCH tx. And then you go on to pretend that a 51% attack is an actual problem right now... talk about concern trolling. The problems with BTC are magnitudes larger than BCH and you know it.

You say you are not into forum trolling, but that is exactly what you are doing."
Backlog transactions that have happened due to the BCH pump&dump ops.. it will return to the normality soon. Nor that it will be extremely faster by a miracle in the next day, but it will not slow down like yesterday, that's an exception.

"Just because Bitcoin has planned to further improve the technology with the DAA upgrade doesn't mean the EDA was a debacle. I wouldn't describe a $21B market cap as a debacle.

Even in this short time, Bitcoin has proven that the 8 MB limit makes it more resilient, lowers fees, and speeds up transactions. Yet legacy coin is making no plans to learn from this valuable information. And they've had years.

There will always be more time. How about instead we make the fantastic technology today. The masses will follow."
"Upgrades must be carefully planned, not rushed while causing unpredicted behaviors (see the BCH and the EDA debacle...).

"Repeating points that I have previously debunked doesn't make your points any less debunked.

You again bring up the flawed brand recognition argument. I have already pointed out that there's nothing stopping creating a brand *and* having technology that works. It's not mutually exclusive. I'll add to the argument that having technology that works is an important part of creating a brand.

You bring up that the mass is not ready to use it. I've already provided arguments and examples showing that this is unimportant. [Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7cmhz2/and_not_a_single_post_about_high_fees_or_slow/dprapck/)

"In order:

- BCH doesn't have any brand recognition. It's like any of the other thousands alt coins out there. Again: I'm not talking about the technology or anything else, only about what the ""normal"" people perceives.

- Bitcoin will be used for normal payments in the future, when the mass will be ready to use it."
"For a moment I'll indulge your brand name argument merely to point out that we can have fast transactions and low fees now, as well as the brand name.

But it's nothing to do with a brand name. Lets instead indulge your argument that people require a vague idea of something before they'll use it. Do you think knowledge of bitcoin is going to spread by bitcoin ""storing value""? Maybe, but the ""vague idea"" people will have is ""Bitcoin holds value, and is useless for payments"".

What about if people are using bitcoin as a payment provider? Making payments is far more common than making transactions to hodl, and likely to happen in more public places. People are going to notice. And what will their ""vague idea"" be? ""Bitcoin can be a payment provider"".

So the brand name argument is a farce, and the ""vague idea"" argument, even if it were accurate, makes no sense when applied to the current state and direction of legacy coin."
"We're talking about money.. probably the second thing the nowadays chaps cares more after their life (and in some cases it comes even for first...).

"If there would've been the time, it would've probably worked that way. But BCH hat to split off before segwit was active or else that would've been with the chain forever. Correct me if I'm wrong here.

Also we don't know what will happen after todays fork. The difficulty should adjust and drop, making it more profitable to mine. Once the hashrate rises it adjusts up and that cycle should go back and forth, but it'll ensure that blocks come in 10 minute intervals, no matter what. After that we'll see how the miners spread out over the chains. Saying that they'll just move away has no basis whatsoever."

> The fastest and cheapest transaction fee is currently 835 satoshis/byte, shown in green at the top.

Yes you can probably get included within a few hours if you're lucky at 300-500sat/byte, but it is *not* next block conf.

For fucks sake, there's been two blocks since I started arguing with you and the average fee in those is 15-20$."
"It doesn't work when demand spikes. During those times either enough people get despondent and just wait, or there is a boundless bidding war in the dark. Add the randomness of the Poisson process and the potential deep spiral of slow blocks due to mining dynamics and you have a grade-A clusterfuck always lurking in the cards, now periodically bringing commerce to a standstill if there is any real normal commerce left in BTC.

What Gmax never understood is that there are different amounts people are willing to pay for transactions to confirm ASAP. When the chain is full of people who need confirmation ASAP, the fee market is completely broken and fees can skyrocket to hundreds of dollars, even thousands per transaction. We haven't gotten there yet, but we are close. Market dynamics help make it less awful than it would be, but there is no way to win against Poisson variation and the hashrate spiral, as well as natural demand fluctuations that are unknowable. 

The design to keep blocksize cap much lower than demand simply doesn't work. 

However... there is a semantic issue I have just discovered that makes this unnecessarily hard to see: it isn't precise to say ""lower than demand,"" nor is it precise to say ""full blocks"" or ""not full blocks."" Because, as Gmax points out, you can always have someone putting out tons of txs if they are free or cheap. Miners could even put them into the blocks. The thing is they don't, because it costs them a bit to do so in terms of orphan risk (a beautiful example of the market for network resources, which Core fails to recognize partly because of its obsession with ""full nodes,"" which aren't even helpful for the network beyond a few mining and infrastructure nodes that will always be dirt cheap to run from the perspective of the major businesses running them). 

Blocksize is naturally self-limiting and the cap should only be a sanity check if we even have a hardcoded cap at all. That brings me to another semantic issue: miners vote every block so there is no such thing as a hard cap anyway, just Schelling points made slightly less convenient to deviate from by software that has hardcoded caps. 

Putting these semantic fixes together, we can more accurately say that *every* block is always full because miners are always deciding the blocksize themselves. Some of them are just unnaturally full due to the artificial quota created by the inconvenience barrier Core has maintained. 

Gmax changed his emphasis away from the old argument that miners would abuse their power if they were allowed to create bigger blocks, probably because he realized that the only thing stopping them was a hardcoded limit that they could easily change by leaving Core or just modifying the code themselves. He moved over to the argument that full blocks are actually a good thing and they create a fee market that will allow blockspace to be priced rationally. Many of us have been pointing out all along that a fee market already exists without a blocksize limit, and this was famously laid out and demonstrated in concrete detail by Peter Rizun. In fact, the blocksize cap ruins the fee market by tying a millstone around its neck with its artificial intervention. 

Core has always been fighting an unwinnable battle by trying to scare people into following their magic numbers, but the FUD they are using is circular: ""Miners must mine at the blocksizes we say because otherwise miners would be free to mine at whatever blocksize they want. Miners must be scared of us users so that they will not deviate from what us users want."" See the problem? The premise is that miners have the freedom to obey or disobey Core, but the concern is that they will have the freedom to disobey Core. It's a self-defeating point, because if they can be scared into following the users, there is no need for a hardcoded blocksize cap at all as they will never mine or mine atop oversized blocks, and likewise the hardcoded cap in Core software must by that logic have no meaning anyway. Either miners want to please users or they don't. If they don't, there is no way to force them to run any particular software, and if they do there is no need to. But Core supporters never seem to think that carefully so as to see the internal contradictions pervading their worldview.

""Miners must stick to 1MB or else they'd be free to mine bigger blocks."" The self-contradictory implication is that miners must somehow self-bind by running Core so that, what, they cannot stop running Core? It is an argument that merely runs in circles and says nothing. **Either miners vote at every block or they don't.** Running Core@1MB is a vote that the current blocks should be no bigger than 1MB, but nothing about Core software magically prevents them from switching their vote at the very next block. Miners are always choosing the blocksize and it cannot but be so. The 1MB cap doesn't exist except as a Schelling point, helped by Core's hardcoding but only until the ecosystem matures more and brings more talent on, as it is doing now. What is there to think about a group aims to stay in power through clearly unsustainable tactics? Through believe that when Bitcoin was a tiny fringe phenomenon it somehow attracted all the most qualified coders and now when it is literally a million times bigger the gigantically bigger pool of talent to draw from cannot beat these guys? No, these are small fry who still have the mindset that they are the big fish in their little pond. The adults are waking up and exponentially more are entering the room all the time, especially now that BCH is around. Decentralization of the network will be preserved by, of course, decentralizing the development - and for basically the same reason. It prevents abuse of power."

When we get close to filling the 8mb blocks, the limit will lift and we’ll expand up to 32mb without needing a hardfork.

One day we may have 1gb blocks being produced. And thats okay because economic incentives will prevent censorship and crypto will prevent theft of your money.

I explain that the fee is decided by the sender, that the high fee wasn't required for a confirmation, and that fees *in the very same block* are less than 0.25 USD.

Nah. This guy you're talking with isn't being honest. Anyone can spend three fucking seconds and look at what the fees to be included in the next block is. Don't waste your time.
"I explained how the mechanism of the fee market worked and how miners choose tx with the best fee. You want to be roughly the 2000th most expensive transaction in the mempool once the block is mined and they scrape the most expensive TX's to be included. 

The very metrics you're using to get ""best guess"" fees are built around moving averages which are... slow to adjust to the real-time status of the fee market, which is my entire point because the market has been falling cheaper and cheaper ever since more hashrate went back to BTC. Because this adjustment happened very quickly, the fee calculation algo's haven't had time to adjust. 

EDIT: and I used ""my link"" to show the actual ""orderbook"" of the fee market\mempool, not for it's estimation. I specifically mention satoshi\byte levels. "

However with this massive inrush and tx backlog people are genuinely furious with Core and want their 1MB changed. 

Core wanted to quietly let 1MB blocks be full with a backlog of maybe 10-20MB but never over 100MB as that is just proof of poor coding and shows them for what they are. They were happy with 1MB until lightning was available and then state ""miners fees are far too high, come use our side chains!""

World needs peer-to-peer, digital, uncensored, border less CASH. Many of us are not into crypto just for a quick buck on speculations. BCH will probably end up bigger than BTC in the long run. For now both currency can coexist and thrive in their respective use cases.

Sure, I'm holding both for now but planning to slowly increase BCH as its brand increases. BTC have literally nothing going on for it besides brand.

Imagine if I today told you about 2 coins and their properties. They are more-less same but one of them have 15$ fees... Which one would you choose? 
All BTC have going for it at this point is brand recognition and that can get him only so far (think Kodak). "
"Well, if you define ""alt coin"" as coin that is not BTC than that is true. It is just a question of ""Bitcoin"" brand. However, don't worry about it. BTC and BCH will serve different use case from now and will be advertised as different thing. 

*BTC = Digital Gold

*BCH = Digital Cash

World needs both. I thought that it all will be in single currency, but I'm Ok if it is diversified into 2 currencies as well since you can easily, quickly, anonymously and cheaply swap between them.

If it takes 2-3hrs to move BCH from wallet A to wallet B, why do people think its a good currency?  Where are those posts?
Oh that’s because btc sucks. Check out ethereum if you are into getting rich.
Geez I wonder, maybe you have the biggest mining pool in the world attacking core. God you people are stupid
If you sort by controversial there are a lot of them. :(
Serious question lets say core does this on purpose, why would they do this? What they would profit from this high fees? Theres something missing here
The cabal that owns the world's economy already owns core. That is now obvious to me. Whether they killed and replaced theymos, are controlling him thru threats, whether he joined them willingly, or whether they've owned it since day one...I don't know. They don't care about high fees and slow trans cause that's the world they already run. All that matters now to them is that BTC continues to take over the world
I spent some BTC (through BitPay) on Friday afternoon which I thought was before things got crazy so I assumed it went through, but it's still unconfirmed 3 days later...
Go to /r/BitcoinMarkets for a more balanced view
Its getting boring discussing this over and over again. There are many altcoins with much cheaper fees than bcash and with similar levels of lack of merchant/user acceptance
"Not true, if you sort by ""controversial"" you can see threads being downvoted and later removed entirely. Though my wild guess that a few of them are people from r/btc simply trolling r/bitcoin, but others are genuinely get banned! Because why not, they give bad cred for bitcoin! /s

Edit: https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7cothn/i_managed_to_get_a_post_about_btc_tx_fees_to_the/ oh hah.

If one truly wants to upset balance, high fees should be all year round, then people will start asking right questions, everywhere."
"BCH work on 0 confirmations as well. BCH can’t be double spend, and don’t have replace-by-fee bug included . Mind blowing, right? ;)

You just can’t re-spend it again until it is settled in next block however you are confident that transaction will happen."
You are laying to yourself. If you are not banned from there yet go and try to create new post about high fees and slow transactions and see what happens.
"That's surely worse then here where the comments that *explain* get voted into oblivion ...

I'm somehow really starting to dislike this sub. Name-calling and thin skinned people all over the place."
"> I posted about the Exodus of hash rate from BTC to Bitcoin cash......and the post was automatically removed and I got a warning from the mods......pitiful.

its this kind of stuff that has me considering jumping ship w my coins. "
This is the real reason BCH has 8MB Blocks. You need them when you haven't had a block in over an hour...
Unless it's on the way from/to an exchange to buy/sell
"true but these are manufactured arguments because the block size is completely adequate unless the mempool is spammed. So it is a bit disingenuous to insist we argue about something that only exists because of nefarious actors. I would be okay having a conversation on this subject if we started out by asking ""should we increase the block size to reduce the impact that spam attacks have on the network"", if you think we should increase the block size to reduce the impact of spam, won't spam just increase to whatever size you pick? The answer is yes, if you didn't increase it enough to appease the spam terrorists. "
A price rise accompanied by a steep drop in marketshare, meaning BTC price could have been much higher.
Funny that they would not anticipate an increase in users and the subsequent complaints of slow confirmations and hight fees.
"I wasn't literally FIFO in that sub, but close.

Didn't even get the project fully off the ground and pioneers were already being personally attacked at every opportunity.

Bitcoin was invented to protect yourself from robber barons. It's amazing to me that so many will jump right back into bed with them.

The concept of peer to peer cash is out of the bag. Don't be Blockstream's useful idiot, or do, whatever, it's not my money you are playing with."
It's ironic that their miscalculation is based on the fact that they were over-pessimistic about bitcoin. No, wait, it's poetic!
"I still own both Bitcoin & Bitcoin Cash equally.  I support both.  Obviously ideally Bitcoin would solve scaling issue and then we'd lose our skism of the community.  

Examples of trolling?"
Pretty sure everyone wears it with pride because everyone knows the sham going on in bitcoin...
Look at the mem pool chart and tell me with a clear mind that the mem pool size is not a fake joke. It has happened so many times in the past three years that it is not worth talking about at this point. 
"Most of the people (especially newbies) go there because the name is ""Bitcoin"" 

Vast majority agree with low fees and faster confirmations but they're spoon fed this nonsense so they believe it.  "
IMHO the policy is only there so they can censor discussion.  The idea of banning discussion of competing technologies is idiotic.
I have been reading both channels, and let's be fair, this sub is by far the most annoying. Why even call this channel btc when it's bch? Do something constructive. 
"I'm not shilling anything, I have posted a fact.

You also seems to ignore the importance of the hash rate related to the security of the transactions and the small amount of hash rate remained owned by a single miner. But how do you care.. right? You have low fees and faster transactions, anything else is irrelevant."
So it is for the Bitcoin: the hashpower will remain on the BTC chain since it'll be more profitable from now on, due to the EDA no more exploitable.
BTC doesn't have to be immune to every conceivable attack, doing so would be a waste of resources and would be akin to a dog chasing its tail. They should focus on their plans and execute. Mempool blow ups are temporary and always resolve themselves when the attackers run out of money or time. 
"I spend most of my reddit time over there and this problem annoys me too. Your comment clearly shows much of the community is reasonable, but the mods are not. 
Remember a lot of folks from /r/Bitcoin will say the same of censorship on this sub though. No one wants to talk about the criminal activity and self-interest of the BCH 'CEO's'. Each side has major issues which are doing real damage to the reputation of Bitcoin."
"Been monitoring segwit usage during the weekend.

Even in the middle of one of the biggest backlog of Bitcoin history not more than 10% use..

"
Dude, it cost me $17 dollars and over 18 hours to move $610 dollars of BTC over the weekend. That system is whack.
My credit card gives me cash back for every tx I make, how will bcash compete with this...
Or paid trolls
What's BTC's use case?
[deleted]
"What if story is exactly opposite? Because right now i see real moves from miners side. What if all this new  forks and BCH stuff is to actually to hold the centralized stacked mining power? 

Lets say Core had this bad plans, miners still could act then and besides community would know if their intents are real or not. 

Miners clog mempool, miners fork btc as an attack and you all think Core has bad intentions. That doesnt really look reasonable. 8 mb blocks mempool still can be clogged if same guys wants to do it, after all  fees will return them what could go wrong? But you see BTC mempool gets clogged whenever those “good” intention miners need it. If theres not something fishy what is happening with all this drama , then you guys are really very naive and living in a pink dream."
"There are posts on this topic, read for yourself if you have the time. 

Banning is bad. It is difficult for me to prove if this is true, unfortunately."
 so when bitcoin scales properly next year what will the point of bcash even be? Its very clear to me that bcash and the people leading the way for it are the exact type of people that created the need for bitcoin in the first place. Its an altcoin and its an ico scam and in the end I cant wait to see it fail and see those who push this crap eat their words.
"As of pumping, you can't pump coin to 20-30billions market cap. That is insane to even think about it.

I agree with your first points but not this. That is like chump change for some people"
Completely agree with you. 100%.
That is definitely an issue and is why I personally support larger blocks, but the original post was a bit misleading by omitting relevant recent information. 
"30 mins to 2 hours (there abouts). All transactions in the mempool fit into a single block, so you just need to wait for a block to be found.

Source: https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/cash/#24h"
"How did they give up? Isn't the development of Lightning network the way to fulfill the currency dream?
Otherwise without Lightning network, BTC/BCH are just going to keep forking until they converge on a protocol that some altcoin is already using. "
"All the times, since segwit activation, when BCH couldn't trigger any difficult hack, all the mempool were cleared perfectly. I guess you're ignoring that miners are milking BCH hacks.

This backlog will be cleared again until BCH comes up with another hack attempt"
mass adoption that has filled the mem pool all while bitcoin is under attack by every competitor... give me a break. Just lok at the mem pool size three weeks ago, it is a joke. 
"That's because most of the hasrate moved again after the difficulty spike.
The new DAA should be active in about 6 hours. Once that's in effect and the difficulty starts adjusting, we'll see 10 minute blocks no matter what the hashrate does."
"Read his comment again. He specifically says that he does not use segwit and still his transactions confirm with 11 sats/byte. Meanwhile others are paying 300 or more and have been stuck for hours.

It's as if there's two distinct groups of users: one believes that fees are at record low and another that thinks fees are at a record high.

And the longer it goes, the more these two groups diverge. It's as if there are two versions of reality."
I was one of the upvoters. Now I unsubscribed from that channel. I’m pro lightning and stuff, but this is ridiculous
Well at least they can't censor it, so their bullshit gets called out.
"Correct, if any of the thousands crypto-currency would be used concretely as a coin, to buy real stuff (not random nerd things here and there just for ""news""), the Bitcoin today wouldn't exist.

But as I mentioned above, the mass is ready yet... so the technology is (sadly, I admit) not relevant at all, what it counts is the branding, that is the reason of why the Bitcoin is the only known coin known outside of this circle-jerk.

This is today.. what it will be in a couple of years, it'll be a completely different matter.
"
You just demonstrated part of the disconnect by comparing Bitcoin to wire transfers. Bitcoin is not another banking mechanism, it's a peer to peer electronic cash system, a paradigm that has never existed before and that should open up new possibilities to the world by being trustless and costing almost nothing to transact.
"bitcoin has ~95% of the hash power right now and still the mempool is increasing... Is this not an issue?

https://blockchain.info/unconfirmed-transactions"
What are the BCH times and fees right now?
"* r/bitcoin = censured

* r/btc = NOT censured

* r/BitcoinMarkets/ is usually neutral and a-political

* Twitter is good. I look for industry leaders and ignore trolls."
"No, alts don’t have brand recognition, market penetration, have high volatility and so on... 

Also, up until yesterday no one knew that BTC will give up on digital currency dream and leave such a big void in market Un fulfilled."
"What solved?

So you're saying there aren't really any real users of BTC, it's a majority of spam? Mass adoption is near!
"I don't believe that spamming are significant factor into this mempool cluttering. 

Even if that is (partly) true, BTC should be more immune to that. It should always have enough space to handle all expected transactions and than some. Bitcoin is having trouble with transactions for over a year now..."
[deleted]
"> Why would anyone talk about it, it is a manufactured event. 

If this was true it would be even more worth talking about."
This will be fixed today. What will your shilling be once we see 10 minute blocks on the BCH chain, no matter where the hashrate goes?
"Market decide what the Bitcoin is used for. When the market (and the mass) will be ready to really use it as a ""coin"", it will adapt. Today is OK as it is.

It's supposed that you have a brain to decide how to use an instrument, without blindly following the decision imposed by someone else, and the market decided to use the Bitcoin as ""digital gold"". Accept this fact or move on and good luck.

Being ""old"" and do not adapt is much worse than being ""new""."
">It's used to store value, hence it doesn't need to be transferred so often.

This was never what Bitcoin was about, how new are you?"
You're 100% right, although the culty downvotes are predictable here. If the market was so concerned with fees they'd use segwit. Since it's used mainly as a store of value, most people don't care. I'm not saying it's good or bad, but the market is what it is. 
"> On the other side the BCH network is struggling and people that want to transfer their Bitcoin Cash are waiting by 6 hours already (see the other messages).

It will be fixed in a couple of hours. Looks like your argument is not a strong long term prospect. "
"Look at the hash rate Exodus.
https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/hashrate-btc-bch.html#3m

The profitability of mining BTC is becoming shit and the coins are useless if the fees make them too expensive to sell or use as currency.

"A long time ago it was not the current dev team he decided not to work with.

I don't think that 8MB block back in August was spam. I think someone was testing the network maybe the devs themselves.
Yea, you're right. The sane people have left since then and some additional crazies joined.
C'mon man. It was obvious a big correction was coming.
I did but it is saying I need a US social security number to get tier 3 verified. I will try and start the process though, maybe it wont have a problem
How do we know that it is a large amount? They made it perfectly clear that they were not going to give that BCH to people so everyone who has any significant amount would withdraw even if he was agains the fork and intended to sell immediately
Aaaannnddd it's gone.
"That's what I hope and you fear: that newcomers run that vaporware and see with their eyes that it does nothing. That's why you posted that link buried deep into a discussion instead of at the very beginning. Clever, but when people see hear the deadline is always ""in 18 months"" no matter how much time passes, they realize it's vaporware even without trying to run a node."
I wish you all the best in your continued efforts to tow the party line and pull the wool over the eyes of newcomers. The facts are out there if anyone reading this wants to check - see multiple links above and pull lnd yourself and try it if you want to check.
"You replied to a post that was pure FUD and narrative and jumped in on it.

The OP was about ""Blockstream motivation to steal transaction fees from miners and pay to Liquid sidechain customers""

Absolute conspiracy theory that Blockstream will 'steal' fees. If anything LN etc (developed by Lightning Labs) will offer users a second fee market. I thought you lot hated high fees and would welcome some market competition?

No - you like shouting 'blockstreamcoreshill' and the like."

Yes but I thought that after 20 Mins basicaly the difficulty goes to zero temporarily in order to force a block. Maybe I misunderstood and someone can eli5 me what this fork does.
I understand, but how can we see if we succeeded in our goal? My intuition tells me blocks are still quite close to each other.
"Yeah, it is great that it is going as well as it is. :-)

One of the sites I was talking about is back up and running and on the correct chain. [Block Explorer](https://bitcoincash.blockexplorer.com/)

Two of the nodes that my wallet looks at are still not updated though. It doesn't really effect my wallet though, because the other 8 nodes are good. I am sure they will figure it out shortly and we will be good soon."
Exactly. No need to be hostile. I am happy coexisting with them for a while. When it comes to actually using it Bitcoin Cash will be the clear choice and value will follow.
Thanks. This one is nice.
"Which they make sure there is not by themselves alone. The reasoning is circular. They argue they are against the hard fork because there is no consensus, but the only reason there is no consensus is that they are against it.

This is the shit that we are dealing with."
That's just adding some fuzziness to the statement so they can game it when it's in their interest to HF.

"The hash rate percent will be (Bitcoin Cash Price / Bitcoin Price)*100

So making up numbers:

Bitcoin Cash $1300 / Bitcoin $6400 = 0.203 * 100 = 20.3%"
"> hashrate ratio will be very close to price ratio

Don't forget fees and reward dynamic (can't spend for 100 blocks). [Dance of DARIs](http://fork.lol) is the best indicator. Bitcoin Cash is obviously winning the split since conception"
The logic is somewhat correct but I also belief the price and bitcoin as a brand is dependent on perception, not technology or performance. Security is what holds its price. The brand is now accepted by big corporations as well as individuals. Like Microsoft in the early days, if it gets the job done even if there were better products, it will have the masses follow. As a payment system it sucks and there are far superior products coming but can't be mentioned by name on this forum. eg. Dxxx. I think BTC will hold its trend and BCH will have its followers as well. The market will take a long time to determine who is to be as upgrades are not limited for neither. What we have today will not look like it 5 years from now. They will leverage from each others mistakes and successes. Short term I favour BTC. 
"Agree. There should be a stream of good news OTW.

Also, consider if there are repeats of major Exchanges halting BTC Deposits/Withdrawals if the network becomes unstable again like on Saturday as Genesis/Coinbase/Shapeshift had to block BTC Deposits/Withdrawals.

Many wallets don't support dynamic fees as high as we see for BTC as well, stranding BTC wallet users unable to transact."
"yep, a little less because of the fees in bitcoin mempool.
"
"Yes, and Mempool dying and blockage decrease usability and price for the BTC Network. 200,000+ Unconfirmed transactions and $20 Fees to transfer BTC will affect the price. Eventually it will cause a panic for BTC users as it goes higher and higher and transactions fail to be confirmed.

BTC will need 2.5 weeks to readjust their difficulty from here."
"Unsure, trying to figure out all of the dynamics, lol.

I'd guess this puts the BTC chain's difficulty adjustment out at 2.5 weeks away. The rest comes down to how fast the BTC mempool floods. Also how the BCH price moves. If BTC's price goes down as it's network floods/slows the effect will compound.

Price Discovery will be important here.

P.S. Other announcements from Major Exchanges adding BCH Trading and Coinbase/BitPay adding BCH for website processing and similar news over the next 1-2 weeks would help.

Edit: Any further BTC price drops would also push Miners over to the BCH chain much more quickly. The next BTC price drop could put it in a death spiral with the DAA in effect."
The only one that matters is hash rate.
any fork is contentious if you throw enough crackpot devs on the team
BTC-BCH split was :)
I recall there being some disgruntlement over exactly which new difficulty adjustment algorithm was picked. Bitcoin Classic decided to fold rather than update.
"Well people are using it. Like 7% of nodes forgot to upgrade.  But they are all stuck on block number 504031, and they will likely never see 504032 because noone is mining their chain now.
"
"> hashrate ratio will be very close to price ratio.

What is the reasoning that leads to this conclusion? "
"By that definition there is a fork happening every block as long as even one guy keeps changing his software.

The real issue is whether a fork is valued by enough investors (and therefore also by miners, and exchanges) to be of any economic significance. In this case, apparently no. So people won't be calling it a split, just an upgrade.

But it shouldn't escape notice that Core is doubly wrong here, because not only are they incorrect that controversial forks are dangerous, they also think such an economically significant surviving fork would be a disaster (and the really economically dim ones think it would create inflation or dilute stakeholder value). BCH (and ETC) prove this is not true at all, and in fact it can be a huge boon if the market hungers for both visions."
2 more block. Looks ok now
It's for fun dude, I don't actually believe in any of the cultist bullshit. 
The moon.
"This is the best metric I've found to show increase in BCH usage:
https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin%20cash-transactions.html#3m"
That's hard to measure. You can look at the number of transactions, but it's not a good proxy, because usage patterns may differ.
"Can you explain how Bitcoin Cash is more centralized than any other crypto currency?

There are 3 development teams, there are many nodes running 3 different clients, and the miners are from the same pool of miners as Bitcoin."
Yes, Blockstream's Segregated Witcoin could be hardforked without problem.
I believe we did have consensus by all practical measurements. =)
"Forks are only ""contentious"" if you are the loser"
This was not contentious.
That's more /r/Bitcoin style. I'm fine with hardfork AND upgrade though.
"It is a fork though, just because no one is using the old client doesn't mean you can't. Now we have two ""functional"" clients that are independand from each other - thus the name fork."
"https://blockchair.com/bitcoin-cash/blocks

Be sure to check the difficulty check box."
I do agree with this. I've thought for a while that it is time to use the term upgrade. The details of the upgrade involve a 'hard fork' but the terminology was too easy to turn on Bitcoin, the users, and community by bad actors like Blockstream. Psychologically it is a pretty easy term to make scary sounding, 'so hard and dangerous' 'a splitting fork, you money is in danger from a bad split' 
"I agree.

Technically, a ""hardforking change"" was introduced. It didn't lead to a *fork*, so it was just an *upgrad*"
"- maybe a **""mandatory upgrade""** is better terminology than ""hard fork"".  Any non-technical user would understand that.  Those that don't follow the mandatory upgrade would expect that their machines / software would now be dysfunctional.

- When a hard fork is done to intentionally branch the chain - eg when there are two or more different philosophical standpoints (or a bunch of a-holes like core) then the term could be that the block chain is undergoing a **""network split""** rather than a hard fork.

Here is an example of how it would be used in layman's terms:

""We were intending to do a **mandatory upgrade** to the bitcoin network to increase the block size to more than 1 mb due to increasing congestion but Core refused to allow this to happen so we decided to do a **network split** instead and create a new coin called Bitcoin Cash.  Anyone holding bitcoins before the split will have an equivalent number of Bitcoin Cash coins after the split."" 

I think that passes the ""could I explain this to my grandmother"" test.

What do you think - should we adopt these or some other similar terms instead using a blanket term ""hard fork""?"

"Software: forked

Blockchain: not forked (better to use a distinct term, like ""not split"")

Certain kinds of software forks have the potential to result in a blockchain split, but they don't unless the investors (and thereby the miners) value both sides of the split."
Where do you think we'll go?
But the software was not forked either. Is there another branch alive and being maintained in parallel? The software was updated, not forked.
i dont think you know what centralization means.
That chain has the EDA that drops difficulty 20% when a block isn't mined in an hour. Some joker might be able to point an old miner in their closet at it and get it going again in a day or two. Won't be worth anything, of course.
Go for it

"> I presume that's the difficulty for that block, rather than con. rules for the next?

I do not know."
"You go it exactly backwards. Hash rate follows price. (Though hash rate = security which helps the price of course, but unrelated to the topic at hand)

The algorithm that determines the difficulty is defined by the speed of the blocks. If it is more profitable to mine bitcoin cash, the blocks will come quicker. (because more miners are mining it) As they come quicker it makes it harder and harder until profitability is equal and blocks are 10 min."

"You're actually correct, but obviously store of wealth doesn't work if everyone is using other competing decentralized coins to do useful things that your coin can't, like global commerce, because they become a better store of wealth by default as they have all the benefits of your coin but there is actually something boosting their price quickly and reliably. People store their wealth so as to have the ability to purchase things when they need to, not to sit on it forever. Holding and spending go hand in hand. Ignore this at your wallet's peril.

Not to mention that under chock-full blocks, as we have seen, you won't be able to rush for the exits if you need to spend or sell your stash in a hurry, at least not without paying through the nose. By hook or by crook you lose purchasing power, exactly what you hoped to avoid by sticking to a ""safe"" store of wealth. Seriously, **holding and spending go hand in hand**. All holders hold to later spend, and all spenders must hold for a time. Separating the two is a fool's errand. Or more generously an economic ignoramus's errand."

"I think we have a Core Troll in our midst, lol. ;)

It's interesting how the DAA offers protection to BCH in case of a price drop, but BTC has zero protection if it's price drops and the Miners migrate to BCH quickly.

Next BTC price drop will be very interesting.
Especially since 200,000+ unconfirmed transactions mean nothing to you.
=)"
Thank u. Accurate
"Thats not how it works. He needs to at least mine 6 blocks for the EDA to even kick in. That would take a substantial amount of time for a mining farm, let alone someone with ""an old miner in their closet"". "
"Ha yeah, theoretically, yes.

Difficulty doesn't drop immediately, though.  It needs at least 6 blocks to be mined before an EDA triggers. 

So yeah, some joker could do it incredibly slowly and get to like 0.0000001% the difficulty after many EDA drops.  

I'm not entirely sure what the point of it would be but it would be a fun ""gag""... :)
"
Well...for one, they don't read it. And 2, they generally have no interest in anything relating to jews (pretty bad history with treating them in the past)
You're right. I got that backwards. So from that, it sounds like it would be (on average) more profitable to mine BCH than BTC slightly greater than half the time until the price of BCH == price of BTC. Is that correct? Should we be expecting to see $3000 BCH and BTC (using an arbitrary figure based on current prices)?
"That's one side, right, but store of wealth also cares about security, and this does not mean only hashrate, security against change of rules (and thus hard forks to change rules) is a big characteristic.

E.g. if you had to bet today on the coin that people think would keep its max supply in 10 years, which one would it be?"
"What's trollish in what I've said? It's just a fact that's it's used more and more as a store of wealth nowadays. It's not a wish.

"They are at this very moment trading which of the two coins are more profitable between each block.

> Should we be expecting to see $3000 BCH and BTC (using an arbitrary figure based on current prices)?

I don't expect the price to be effected at all by this change, except for the fact that bitcoin cash now has gotten rid of the scary and broken EDA.

Nothing about this should cause their prices to drift toward equal. Unless this causes people to value Bitcoin Cash more.

This is just a method of keeping block times at 10 min averages and security as high as possible."
The Romans killed Jesus btw...also if you are going to lay blame on a Jewish sect, it would be the Sadducees, which died out as a religious movement and have no connection to the Jews of today.
"The Coinbase CEO has been hinting at adding BCH support on his Twitter account, based on his re-tweets: https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong

BitPay Chairman/Co-founder re-tweets seem pro to adding BCH support also:

There can't be anything mandatory in decentralized system
Exactly this. Hashrate is all that matters. Nakamoto consensus has NOTHING to do with community sentiment, user opinion. Bitcoin has never been a democracy. Hashrate is consensus/polling/voting, and that is it. 
Agreed.  If Coinbase suddenly adds BCH support, BTC might be in for a rough time.
"Yes, we will.

That comes after Leviticus.
He's catholic...this is the Hebrew part. They don't like to remember that.
I thought as much :-)
Yep difficulty has adjusted :)
Very handy - thanks. I presume that's the difficulty for that block, rather than con. rules for the next?
Isn't that assuming price follows the hashrate? What's the incentive for that to actually happen? 
I should say I'm new to BTC politics, the center stage of which BCH has recently taken. I'm assuming the difficulty of BCH can be directly compared to the difficulty of BTC. I don't believe difficulty functions on the same scale across all coins (such as ETH) since they don't use the same hash algorithms. BTC and BCH are both SHA256, correct?
"> Yes but I thought that after 20 Mins basicaly the difficulty goes to zero

No, that's not how this works at all. That would be **very bad** for multiple reasons.

The new algorithm simply defines the difficulty for the next block. The difficulty does not change between blocks."
"I believe that was Tomas Zander's proposal.

It was problematic in some ways. Because the difficulty would adjust so quickly, it opened the possibility of new gaming opportunities. I also believe there is some merit in having blocks grind to a halt during a network partition.

The current DAA is a 144 block (1 day) moving average, with a target of 10 minutes."
In the end: yes. But hashrate is influenced by other factors. You'll have to look at the decision-making processes in the mining headquarters.
Basically things will just run smoother. It will take a day or two to really take full effect. There won't be long waits for confirms, and there won't be out of control inflation.

U don't understand Nash theorem. There **can't be** a balance. Only shifting equilibrium 
If the price is lower then miners will be more profitable on the other chain, and leave. So the hashrate will decrease until it matches the price.
"> What is the reasoning that leads to this conclusion?

Assuming it is already the case (this means the two coins are equally profitable to mine)

Then assume price rises in favor of BCH. Miners will switch to BCH (some of them, not all at once). Difficulty will adjust upward and make both coins equally profitable to mine again (effectively stopping *every* miner from switching). So we've reached that equilibrium again.
"
Sure, problems with Core itself will help accelerate the process but Core's mistakes alone won't make Bitcoin Cash a winner it needs to also be successful in it's own right.  We only have control over the one side of the equation Core's behavior is what it is.
Xapo, Tenx and Revolut are the key. None of them yet have any plans. Especially disappointed with Xapo. :(
Also keep in mind the price direction. If Miners believe the future value of a coin reward will be higher/lower by the time they can dump/sell for their preferred currency and how much they may lose there. Depending how a coin is trending...

Unconfirmed transactions are not that big of a deal for the largest use case of Bitcoin nowadays, which is a store of wealth.
"> The reasoning is circular. They argue they are against the hard fork because there is no consensus, but the only reason there is no consensus is that they are against it

exactly - 10,000 upvotes

> This is the shit that we are dealing with.

This is the shit that we ~~are~~ *were* dealing with.

The best way to defeat that kind of game is to just go right around it and do our own thing.  We win by making Bitcoin Cash more relevant, more useful, more widely adopted and being wary of ever letting any of those toxic a-holes ever come near our system.  We don't have to fight them to win anymore."
Hashrate follows price, not the other way. If BCH = .15 BTC, you can expect 15% of BTC hashrate after a few blocks.
"Exactly! This is the only way to maintain balance and avoid miners jumping back and forth.

1 usd u/tippr"
In my opinion, it depends on if BCH price can hold. If it does, enough miners will leave BTC and thus slow it down. I believe they have 3 weeks before their next DAA. If the network slows down too much, you will see capital leave BTC for BCH like we saw over the weekend (but in a more stable manner). The price of BCH is the key, without it being stable and/or increasing, there won't be enough of an incentive for enough miners to leave BTC. Miners need to leave BTC to slow it down and create the cascading affect of high fees + slow block times.
"And it shows the same difficulty 522 billion so far.

So I will wait for the next one, too."
Could have checked Monero, they're at like hard fork 18 or so?
Now instead of exploiting EDA, I suspect miners will exploit the long difficulty adjustment time of BTC.
It's not hard to execute a hard-fork on a completely centralized cryptocurrency...

"and which block # will be ""Apocalypse""? Oh wait, this one is reserved for BTC. "

Oh no - reminds me of Luke-something or other...
Believe that's for the block itself, rather than the current target. New consensus rules apply from here. Anybody have a calculator/site that tells us the current BCH difficulty? fork.lol and friends not reflecting the new algorithm yet.

"After ""Genesis"" #1 and ""Exodus"" #478559, I propose that block #504031 be named ""Canaan"". "
yep they've reached an equilibrium. Now we just wait for the BCH price to rise relative to BTC, then the death spiral will slowly strangle BTC.
And it's working great !
Don't forget the wallet devs! A big thank you to all those who helped get those clients up to speed with the new DAA. Great work, guys!
"Yes, congrats. 
DAA dropped to 36% or so of pre-fork.

Looks like we'll get 20% of Miner Hashrate?
The rest will depend on BCH price (and BTC price drop as their network slows?).

Anyone care to speculate where we go from here?"
"the price fell from 1430 til 1279$.
so.. the upgrade is the beginning of the dumpening?"
Now we need Roger to strike with that 45k of BTC and this would be over.  The profitability is 1:1 right now and BCH is only $1330.
Oorah!

"The next important step is integration with existing services.  Especially important is support by Coinbase, Bitstamp, Gemini, and itBit.  Right now most of the exchanges that have good support are in Asia.  Kraken is the only US one and it sucks hard in terms of reliability.  Shapeshift is really the only option for folks in the US right now and that isn't very high volume.

Also integration with OpenBazar and merchant services.  Once that happens and transaction volume begins to rise then I think you will start to see more action on the price."

Welcome to the world, Shuya Yang!
The only people to ever claim they were dangerous were the Blockstream Core devs. They had the most to lose if another team/the users became unhappy with their behavior. They knew their attempts to turn Bitcoin into their Blockstream Fee Business would not go over well. So they needed the propaganda, the fear, the control. They tried to reign in and control an international P2P cash system. They actually thought they could do it. Shows how self destructively selfish/greedy and utterly short sighted they are. 
"It appears that the HF was successful, and all three implementations (Bitcoin ABC, Bitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin XT) are tracking the same chain.

Congrats to everyone from all three dev teams who made this happen!

roy"
Hurray. The impossible upgrade by hardfork worked once again.
Yeah I was just wondering about this
[deleted]
Experimental proof that hard-forks are safe. Huge congrats to all the independent development teams that worked hard to pull this off! Nice work Bitcoin ABC, Bitcoin XT, and BUCash devs.
I prefer [this one](https://bitcoincash.blockexplorer.com/). If that is what you are talking about.
"Why do we have to be hostile towards the other chain?
"
"Do we even know if that's what he plans to do with his Bitcoin?

Price is stuck. BTC is flying high.

Am i not seeing something?"
that's just noise / price finding
"See the thread regarding Ver setting up BTC->BCH buys at around 0.2   

The theory is that the big players are going to keep mining both in order to get their money out at a reasonable time and price before slowly draining the rest of the hashpower.  "
buy the r sell the n
"Yeah, well. The time to upgrade was relatively short. Like 2 weeks.
"
There will always be outliers, but the rolling average should be a silkier silk and a smoother smooth.
The way the POW algorithm works, even the occasional 40 minute block is to be expected. It approximates a Poisson distribution, with an expected period of 10 minutes.
Technically it still can, but it's gonna be less likely to happen.
"> The only people to ever claim they were dangerous were the Blockstream Core devs. 

To be fair, they only claimed a hardforking change was dangerous in the absence of near-unanimous consensus."
When you have a tiny network and few users and developers forks are a lot easier. 
No. 1 hours blocks (for example) happen quite a lot, even when difficulty is perfectly aligned to hashrate. This has always been the case.
https://i.imgur.com/XS5LK.gif
"> Anyone care to speculate where we go from here?

hashrate ratio will be very close to price ratio.

So with a price of 0.2 BTC/BCH we should get 20% of the miners (a little less when bitcoins mempool is boasting with fees like now)
"
BCH has proved bigger blocks work and now we are showing how a community upgrade can happen with a hardfork. Two core talking points being proven wrong.
Sorry, I'm new to BTC. How does this compare to the average? Is this an improvement? Due to all the optimistic talk, I'm going to assume it is. So is that miner hashing power coming back to BCH tonight?
BCH is already 1.01x more profitable than BTC https://fork.lol/

"Day trading is quite risky, Bitcoin, at least at the time this meme started, was guaranteed to rise in price over time; so if you wanted guaranteed returns in the long term, you should hodl instead of trying to guess the market movements minute to minute, and never panic sell when it looked like it was going down.

Over time the meme mutated a little, losing a bit of it's connection to anti-day trading arguments and started to just be used to refer investing in a coin seeking long term profit.

The next few days to months will show whether hodling legacy Bitcoin is still a good idea or not (personally, I'm betting on not; but it's usually recommended that you shouldn't take investment advice from other people, study things yourself and come to your own conclusion on what to do)."
how ironic
"Damn it, you're right. Never done that before (never run a node on my Pi, this was just a shower thought). Doesn't sound optimal, but I guess it's doable.

Oh well, I might still post it to /r/bitcoin just to rustle some jimmies."
"Yeah, I got that relic. I guess the mempool might barely fit right now, all things considered (gotta consider the OS, the UTXO cache and sig cache) , so I might wait for a few hours before I post this to the censored sub to get banned in style.
"
Give this man a tip. 
Doesn't the smallest pi have like 256MB RAM?
I bet you won't dare post this on /r/Bitcoin. OTOH I can understand if you don't want to get banned
I can in 4 minutes. Gonna be worth it.
You can set the mempool size of your node to a lower value, like 30MB instead default 300MB.
