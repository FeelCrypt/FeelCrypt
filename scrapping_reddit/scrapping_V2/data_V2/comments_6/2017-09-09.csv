I thought that was funny
I wanna see you walk into best buy and get a flat screen TV then drop a brick of Columbian on the counter with a completely straight face.
You don't understand Bitcoin then.  It will always retain value as it's a censorship resistant platform for free speech 
That could be a dangerous scenario. 
eh. i think its closer to them forbidding hard drugs like cocaine. in colombia they literally use cocaine as a currency (i might be wrong)
"Nope, that doesn't matter either, because *somebody will*. The profit from doing so accrues to those that do, allowing them to effortlessly outcompete those that don't. It's like being the only one in your neighbourhood with access to money accepted in real global trade while everyone else has to use vouchers you hand out, you get a massive advantage from that position and can use it to dominate anyone without that advantage.
"
I can declare gravity illegal, too. That doesn't actually have any effect on material reality. Whether or not people can access it is the *only thing that is relevant*.
"Crypto allows people to circumvent the ban. That doesn't change that government can still pass a law that bans crypto.

 A ban would also shove the crypto market under ground rather than out in the open. When you can operate a mine, an exchange out in the open, you can do so far more effectively. While a ban doesn't stop people from using Bitcoin it still hurts the market severely and slows  mainstream adoption. "
They've had NEON wallet for quite a while, it works well.
Not just if they can access it, but if they will.
Plus, anyone getting in on ICOs will make MORE after China gets access in the secondary market!
The mining is no problem. They can ban the miners if they want, a couple guys mining on their gpus is enough to make the system work if it comes to that.
It generally works better if you present your non-fait payments at the back door.
Uh, no. The math is necessary infrastructure, but it has no inherent value like food, land and water. The moment people stop exchanging goods and services (directly or indirectly) for your coins is the moment it loses all value. 
Please explain how you think a brick of the commodity called cocaine is any less of an international medium of exchange than gold....or bitcoin.

* They can use the chinese firewall to try and cencor and block anything bitcoin related information outside of china
* They can come and take your computer (very unlikely) or shut down your mining business (more likely)
* They can create a belief that anything bitcoin is dangerous and anti-china and start witch hunts that way or start persecuting the best known Chinese players in bitcoin. 
* They can slow down any data exchange related to the blockchain going in or out china

The translation of the article: https://t.co/rFCo0VWBqB?amp=1
I was an intern at Coinbase during the winter.  From what I've been told, they don't want what happened to Ethereum ICOs to take over the NEOsphere.  Surprisingly a lot of officials are already on board with it, honestly, don't be surprised if this was an attempt to buy in for cheap.
I don't think you understand the concept of value at all. I can pull a string of words out of my ass and you better believe it is the most censorship resistant ever - it doesn't mean it's of any value or confidence to anyone else.

"So the government can't ban calculators, but they can ban people buying calculators.

No.
"
"They aren't banning the exchanges either (that's FUD that comes around about every 3 months for the past 4 years...)

China is banning ICOs and ICO exchanges. They are not banning crypto currencies and crypto currency exchanges. Rather they are banning tokens that resemble traditional securities. "
"That isn't going to be any more effective as long as any countries in the entire world exist with high volume regulated exchanges. Effectively they just become the new trade points with the jurisdictions which have banned cryptocurrencies, and the fiat currency in which those exchanges trade has upward pressure from all the trade activity in the space at the expense of all the fiat currencies which have banned high volume regulated exchanges. Arbitrageurs will thank the idiot politicians that created the situation and added to their margins. End users outside the affected jurisdictions will profit at the direct expense of those inside.

The only way to influence the trade link between fiat and crypto in a major way is to cut *all links* simultaneously across the world in every jurisdiction. That is simply not going to happen, governments across the world agreeing on cooperation on something of that magnitude, where anyone who defects does so with a massive benefit to their economic position at the expense of all of their competitors, is just a pipedream for authoritarian assholes. Such a project would be more contentious than the present similar one trying to globally regulate co2 emission by orders of magnitude, and the penalties for those who go along with it, as well as the benefits for those who defect, would also be much greater.

This cannot be stated any more simply; efficient access to trustworthy hard currencies is an indisputable economic boon, and the converse is just as certain. The only thing cryptocurrencies change from this historical fact is that now that access simply cannot be denied."
"Right. Well this really reinforces my belief in crypto's power to resist government. 

I came across Blocknet too. Very interesting. It's my intuition that these will all replace the current fiat exchange platforms. Especially should the government wield some sort of banhammer or increase regulation / decrease user freedom.

But decentralized platforms will probably be cheaper, and safer. At least in theory. But it'll always be peer to peer, so less liquidity? Kind of like an automatic escrowed localbitcoins? If yes... why aren't speculative prices higher already?"
Yes and that's why ZRX and DNT are a long term hold.
"But when you can publish that anal bead string of words that came out of your ass into a decentralized censorship resistant ledger, you have free speech, which if you haven't noticed is being squeezed out of the legacy internet.  Crypto empowers Web 3.0, and as a foundational layer that will always have value to those that want their voice heard.  

Crypto also clearly shows that all money is, is information.  Money doesn't exist without consciousness."

I'm not against layer 2 solutions. But there is no good argument for not raising the limit to allow more than 3 transactions per second for the time being. Core doesn't even support segwit 2x. It's laughable. And if you want to talk about an ugly hack... (segwit)
"Yeah there were good odds that Sun Tzu would've said something like that. But his quotes tend to be more directly related to war and combat as far as I can remember (I read like one or two pages of them many years ago.) so I thought that I should google that quote just to be sure. 

But Napoleon was very successful at warring too so that quote should be considered thoughtfully anyway. It's a useful and good quote, I agree."
Now that I think about it you're right -- all the quotes by Sun Tzu that I remember are *very* specific to the technicalities of war -- but you can read into them and apply them to life.

">The fees are lower now because there are less transactions on the Bitcoin chain

Here's my anecdote. I used to do maybe a dozen BTC transactions a week. Now I try to do zero."
"Each page of moderator actions covers 1-2 days, and there are prev and next buttons at the bottom of the page.

So If you were banned about a year ago, you could probably find a record of it if you pressed next 200-400 times."
"If BTC can do 3 transactions per second with its 1 MB blocks then BCH can do 24 transactions per second with its 8 MB blocks.

To match the 24k per second Visa figure you mentioned, BCH would need 1000 times bigger blocks, or 8 GB blocks. At 144 blocks per day, that's 1152 GB per day, or one new 1 TB hard drive every day.

BTC's solution is to use the exponential growth available by using off-chain transactions on layer 2 rather than naively increasing the blocksize limit in a vain attempt to match demand for onchain transactions.

Maybe think some more about BCH being ""the solution"". At best it's an ugly hack that kicks the can down the road (but not very far)."

"> Also note that high fees are currently a thing of the past on the original chain

"To answer your question, if you only own the chain that _doesn't_ become successful, you are out of luck, and will lose everything, just like the last example you gave. If you want to be neutral, own an equal number of each. I believe the original chain has been irrevocably compromised. The legacy chain's direction and the team that has taken control of it represent the opposite of everything that attracted me to bitcoin years ago. But to a newbie; always be comfortable with the possibility of losing everything before you invest in something. Personally, I can afford and am OK financially if Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash were to fail. Also, I would consider this to be a very strange and potentially riskier time to get involved in all this if you are new."
It all has to do with profit and control. The big businesses that are invested in Bitcoin Core like to own the bitcoin layer and have all the people that want to use bitcoin as a currency move to a higher layer. This gives them the most control and so the biggest chance to make a profit.

Naturally, I was a bit baffled at this sudden loss of respect and was wondering about what caused it. Simply *asking* you if my first impression was correct shouldn't be too aggressive?

What reasons have I made up and what hole am I digging? I feel you're jumping to conclusions about my motives all over the place now, while I *try* not to do the same about you. Now I'm genuinely not sure what you would accept people to say to you after you told them that you lost all respect for them. Is there any way I could've explained myself or asked you about what you meant in a better way (so that I may learn not to offend, next time)?

> Well you reward toll behavior.

If you see it as me rewarding trolls, I somewhat understand what you're getting at. In my opinion it's the people who fling insults as trolls that reward them. I should hope I'm allowed to hold that opinion without losing the respect of non-fanatical people.

I *like* asking questions and honestly trying to understand what make people come to their opinions, trolls included. It's just how I approach life in general, I guess.

It's nothing special. It simply restores ones ability to post like others (who haven't received a ton of downvotes.)

It's an excuse to call it ""special"" or ""reserved for X, Y and Z people only"" or whatever.

It's the only use of whitelist. It's not even visible anywhere. It's not a flair or a tag or anything like that.

Ok, I'm not familiar with the background for these throttling policies or why they were added to reddit as a whole (in my last post I was just guessing at the motivation).

Ok, so that's suboptimal, at least from a transparency viewpoint. Do you know if this is a policy or if there's just no way to open it due to the way reddit works?

This is Reddit policy regarding downvotes. This happens on any other sub. Stop trying to conflate it with ""censorship"", you ridiculous troll.

And no, not receiving special treatment regarding it doesn't make you a victim of anything. I haven't been able to post on your sub at all for over 2 years. That is what actual censorship looks like. Since you're so concerned about the topic, I eagerly await your making a thread there seeking community support to change the state of affairs there.

Oh what's that? You won't do that? Why am i not surprised?"
Thx, will do.
"> Read the comments too.

What the comments seem to show is that you and nullc claim that not being added to the short whitelist (which apparently is reserved for prominent members of some kind) is essentially the same as being blacklisted. Not sure I agree with that sentiment. If I did, it would mean that I, myself, were *also* being censored by not being on the whitelist, which I think would be a silly argument to make.

The rest seems to be a misunderstanding of the reddit-wide throttling of comments based on karma in a given subreddit (which I assume they've added for good reasons... anti-antagonism or whatever).

> This also proves how useless ""open modlog"" is. Can't even find out who banned me there, or that the ban happened!

I'm glad it's open and I don't think it's useless. But if it doesn't show bans, it's certainly not the end-all and be-all of transparency. Have they chosen to leave that aspect out of the mod log or are bans a completely separate thing due to the inner workings of reddit?

I guess that goes for the whilelist as well: Is this open (or available upon request)?"
"Wait, are you referring to where nullc is claiming that being downvoted is the same as the mods removing comments?

If not, can you try to be more specific than pointing to an entire post?"
"The community you claim to both represent and not represents does not want  artificial transaction throughput limits. People want to transact cheaply and reliably.

The 'community' on /r/bitcoin is maintained by sockpuppet accounts and banning anyone who even slightly questions anything. That's not the real community."

"At this point you must realize you're fooling no one. This entire diatribe claiming censorship has been left in tact. It's pathological. I just read the back and forth about the post rate limiting. Not being whitelisted is not equivalent to being censored. Full stop.

It's pretty hard to divorce politics from money.  Anything that involves groups of people involves politics in some form.
"I think what is really going on is Core is depriving the community of the arguments from our side. It's like arguing the constitution (our side) versus scrapping the whole idea (their side). It's not the people, it's the leadership and deception.

If they want to show us how it is done, start, Corecoin. It's really simple stuff.

Bitcoin Cash is *not* Bitcoin. Fooling people to think otherwise is an attack towards them.

Well this is a bitcoin subreddit, no? Shouldn't we strive to accept everyone?  I unsubscribed from /r/Bitcoin, so I would have no idea what their arguments are unless core fans came here. 
I just just went over there and checked - I think that they have stopped worrying about BCH, and they are shitting their pants over Segwit2X.

Same reason top posts here shit on bitcoin seg. What do you have to gain....value. 
If I take your numbers, $1700 and $600, as currentthen I would say that Bitcoin has added $ 2300 in value since the fork.

Your correct that its not Bitcoin by name yet.  But it sure is by design.  It will be Bitcoin by name as well shortly.  
">Stop calling your altcoin Bitcoin? Call it Bcash or something that's not easily mixed with Bitcoin, OK?

The consensus here is that Bitcoin Cash is actually Bitcoin as detailed in the whitepaper. Once the total POW exceeds what is now called Bitcoin, I plan on calling Bitcoin Cash Bitcoin. Because we think this, it makes sense to give it a name that makes people mix it with Bitcoin. Not for the purpose of tricking people into using it, but rather so that a thoughtful individual sees two coins claiming the name Bitcoin and thinks for themselves/researches about which has the more credible claim to the name. This is how Bitcoin Cash will win in the long term, thoughtful individuals making their own decisions, honestly. 

>Bitcoin Cash is not Bitcoin. Fooling people to think otherwise is an attack towards them.

We are not attacking them, this severe language is not required. By buying Bitcoin Cash, they are buying a version of Bitcoin that is more focused on the cash aspects of money FIRST, as an avenue to a store of value. Not the other way around.

Really easy to spot and ignore these trolls with RES.
Scared? This is some back-to-the-wall panic right here. You *do* know that this subreddit has transparent moderation logs and we can all see that nobody is prevented from posting in this subreddit, and your claim is *de facie* horseshit.

Bitcoin cash is Bitcoin. Deal with it.

"BitcoinCore is orchestrating a campaign to control Bitcoin, forever. 

That is what we are up against."
"BCH is actually more like the original ""bitcoin"" than btc is. Segwit is a further departure than blocksize increase imo. 

Also, what posts of yours were censored?"
You are no where near actively silenced. Unlike r/Bitcoin, you can actually say anything about btc bcash you want without being removed. You are just limited by how many posts you can make per 20~ minutes which was because of the karma you had when you made the comment you linked. I would rather have the ability to say anything I want about a topic over being able to post constantly and being banned or censored for saying certain things.
Projection is a hell of a drug. How's it treating you?
The fact that r/bitcoin (the face of core) has chosen the path of dogmatic censorship is already proof that they are desperately trying to maintain control and brainwash their people, not unlike North Korea. This is in direct opposition of the vision of bitcoin already, which is about decentralization and freedom. At the end of the day, truth will always triumph.
"Well Bitcoin cash is actually the closet thing to Bitcoin.

The Bitcoin core project is a radical departure from the original design.

Remember one of the main arguments to make Bitcoin a settlement layer is that Bitcoin onchain is fundamentally broken. (Cannot scale, will centralize)

Are you denying that Bitcoin core ow a departure from the original design?"
"You clearly haven't read the whitepaper. Bitcoin cash functions far more similarly to the original bitcoin. You support radical changes that thousands who came before you do not approve.

>    A  purely   peer-to-peer   version   of   electronic   cash   would   allow   online payments   to   be   sent   directly   from   one   party   to   another   without   going   through   a  financial institution.

Full blocks lead to a fee market that doesn't allow Bitcoin to spend like cash. The solution is to push people to stop using direct party to party transfers out of necessity. 

> We define an electronic coin as a chain of digital signatures.  Each owner transfers the coin to the next by digitally signing a hash of the previous transaction and the public key of the next owner and adding these to the end of the coin.  A payee can verify the signatures to verify the chain of ownership.

Next you separate the signatures and still call yourself Bitcoin.

While I don't agree with anything you say. If this was actually censored, I wouldn't be able to read your posts.
it's completely useless to try and argue with you so I'm just going to say that I categorically disagree with every single point you made
You can't expect any honesty of consistency out of them. Their position is to be the developers of the group that never forks bitcoin. 
Hahaha, best laugh of today. I still remember the first days of bitcoin when people got pissed because he was including prayers in to the like sidechannel data in the blockchain or something.
