could you provide a reference for your claim about Okamoto working for the NSA?
No. If you’re a journalist leave him alone. If you’re a hobbyist or someone making money in the space go find it yourself. 
True story. I posted one thread yesterday about the new things on Bcash as Op-codes and Smart Contracts and ask for thoughts on the war of Bitcoin and bcash with my neutral mind. They banned the thread, lol!
Desperate much?
"you specifically claimed that satoshi's block size limit was to protect us from ""malformed blocks"". why do you not want to elaborate? what are these blocks?"
"You're confused. Read again the history you were just lecturing on. 

Do you agree that any transactions  with valid format and fee amount is not spam -  or do you think some types of transactions should be censored.  If so., what types and how? "
"you're the one making a claim about malformed blocks and you're refusing to explain the difference from ""normal"" blocks."
Answer the question on classifying spam.  If you knew anything you'd know the exact reason satoshi added the limit on temp basis. 
Achieve? Its just a damn setting. 
LOL. BTC should change the stolen name. Your segregated non-cash settlement coin is - by definition - not Bitcoin anymore. 
Good then get out of our space (BTC) and change your name for BCH and be honest about your message. Quit it with your counterfeit coin
