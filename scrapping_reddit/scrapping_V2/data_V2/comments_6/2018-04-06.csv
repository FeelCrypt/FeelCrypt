Trying to.
Why should I? That'd be a lot more trouble than solving anything.
"At this point I am unsure helping MtGox Legal exclusively would be for the best of this case. Until there is any progress it doesn't make sense to even start putting together a CR plan as we don't know yet what the requirements will be, and there remain a big obstacle for CR to happen at all.

Because of my position I cannot really endorse one or another creditors group, and while not all creditors group have a forum/etc ready, most have at least a website. I know there are at least 4 groups out there, but I'm not even sure if it's everything or not.

I know I initially offered to help. At the time the situation was much more confused than today and there was a general lack of understanding of the situation with the surplus at the time, the creditors meeting with the trustee however woke up a lot of people, and not only people are more informed now, someone actually filed for civil rehabilitation.

As a reminder, sending this email is a one shot thing. It's unlikely it'll be possible to send more emails in the future."
He is not involved anymore. He initially created MtGox and kept a role of auditor after the transfer in March 2011, until June 2011. His accesses were revoked after June 2011.
Because there are larger issues here than just myself.
"We didn't perform checks that far at the time. At the time I considered the checks in place to be a hurdle enough for people to not do too much weird things.

MtGox do have a complete history of every transaction and trade made on the platform, with details of account id, API key used, IP address, etc. so this would be easy to analyze."
1% of a billion is still $10 million
MtGox only allows people to have one account, and has systems limiting access to multiple accounts from the same IP, as well as limiting accounts per person by checking birthdate/country/name.
Not since the deadline has passed, however if civil rehabilitation happens there'll likely be a new window to file claims.
"A lot of that is easy to fake, you can have a friend or spouse open an account and use a VPN for a different IP address. Or it could even be two legitimate people colluding to wash trade with each other.

I was specifically asking if there is any check for anomalous activity, like two (or even a group of) people continually trading between each other. How hard would obvious collusion be able to detect? 

Also, does MtGox have a complete history of every transaction and trade made on the platform, by account, and/or did they in the past? And/or what kind of records are/were there?"
What is Jed's role, accountability in all this from beginning? To what extent is he involved in the current legal case?
That's fine! For the record, if they had paid your travel and bought you lunch, I wouldn't have seen a problem with it. It's just not nearly enough of an incentive or conflict of interest to lie about such thing, even if you weren't already a kajillionaire :)
How and when (and how do you even know how much) will I get my lost coins?
"> Not MtGox who also claimed they were not running fractional reserve, hence the fraud charges.

Sure, if Mark was claiming that he was not running a fractional reserve at that time, when he purchased MtGox, then there is a legal liability."
"* There is nothing set yet as to the need for an official claim or not. Ideally it shouldn't be required, but it may not be legally an option. Civil rehabilitation would however likely grant a new claim filing window, allowing people who didn't file to finally file.
* Monitoring the mtgox.com webpage for updates is probably the best everyone can do.
* I don't. The trustee does."
"> As a reminder, sending this email is a one shot thing. It's unlikely it'll be possible to send more emails in the future.

That's great, so you're going to send an email to everyone ?"
"Again, if you think mark giving back the money at the value of 4 years ago counts as making us whole, let me do that with your bitcoin.

If you don’t want that, you clearly don’t consider it as returning all the money. It’s that simple "
Not defending Mark at all costs, but holding for the truth. If true that this hacking occurred over years, I do not think this will bode well for Mark. I find it very difficult to believe that he would not have noticed such a large leak.
"Hi Mark, We've asked you repeatedly to help Mt Gox Legal reach out to people who are genuine creditors (using your mailing list of former customers) so we can give them FREE access to the forum we run. I'm asking you again to help us do that so the information we have already on the forum and the future developments can be shared with known creditors. As you know sharing information freely with the wider public restricts what can be said, so we need a way to verify creditors are real and you sending an invite to people on your mailing list would be a really helpful way of achieving that.

We aren't asking for anymore money from anyone. We already have a sizeable fund for legal costs, donated by creditors who joined and gave of their own free will. You yourself advised people to get legal advice, which I'm sure you know isn't free, so you HAVE effectively told people to spend money, and rightly so. Spending it on a shared lawyer is cheaper than hiring your own. 

In your latest email to me you said you were reluctant to help because you thought we were against you and we wouldn't co-operate. We aren't, but actually feels that you are against us and aren't co-operating. 

And who is ""us""? We a co-operative of creditors. Over 900 so far. Individual creditors with nothing else in common than they lost money on Mt Gox. The sort of people you are saying you are trying to help. In the 6 months Mt Gox Legal has been going have you heard any one of those 900 members leaving the group, bemoaning or criticizing what we're doing, calling it a scam? They would have filled reddit by now if it was. So if the people who are involved are satisfied with what it's doing, why don't you relax your resistance?

We make decisions by vote, and that's why we'd like more creditors to be involved in what we're doing. We've asked you a number of times to help us achieve that by helping us to open the forum for free access to known creditors. 

Now I'm asking you publicly again. Will you help this time? "
You would need to practice, recite it a couple times a week for several months but soon enough it would be like reciting the alphabet. You never doubt your own ability to remember the alphabet right?
Pray away, buddy. No one cares. 
Yeah I clocked that your figures were a bit fucked aha.
Government isn't real either.
Who cares what mood your in. Definitely not Internet strangers. Okay cool, so why didn't you say this in the first place. This isn't talking about people at the margins of society or anything like that, rather the marginal increase in happiness that bitcoin provides. Cool why didn't you say this rather than parrot that one expression and then make vague references to people at the margins of society. It would have prevented you feeling so stressed and tired 
You followed me and asked the questions, why follow unless your willing to put your point across. You haven't yet explained what your point is simply spouting real economics happens at the margin with no further explanation, other than examples with no explanation of the example. As shown by my reply I have an interest in your point, but you reply to long points with one or two sentence  answers which lack quality and depth. So yes, please leave, you dont know me or my reactions or economics so stop projecting and imagining. 
"Maybe it happens but it's not required in order to be ""part of the world"""
"You've done nothing but fight me over semantics with no attempt to even try to understand what I was ever talking about and you're just frothing with anger. I have no desire to talk to you in this state.

I thought my previous comment would clear up the misunderstanding but it seems you have no interest in that."
Goes back to the parent comment, money isn't real so it doesn't matter one way or another.
Tell the gov then. Tell Tesla to go more bankrupt then. Check out /r/HypeWave, it's all about Tesla/SpaceX. So Tesla is Enron, thats why the stock swings 30%/week & no one cares.
Loans can be subsidies in the form of having little or no interest for some or all of the duration of the loan.

"The problem is that Bitcoin is directly attacking fiat and it isn't like some financial product. All financial products are still under the umbrella of the US dollar or something in the control of these big organizations.

Bitcoin isn't. They can't print more of it. They can't play with the interest rates. They can't forgive debt. They can't reclaim money. They can't do anything. There are some benefits to this and some risks but very clearly it is disruptive to the entire world order. "

"Essentially Bitcoin is a new financial product. But I agree with you it's way more disruptive than maybe all financial products before it.  

A decent comparison is the internet itself.  It's not really directly regulated (globally, but it is in some countries) because that's impossible.  However those individuals/companies that use it are regulated.  If Bitcoin is to become mainstream I see no real difference here. So we need to manage the narrative with regulators to ease acceptance rather than ignore and dismiss them enabling the FUD to set the tone.

The things listed here about governments losing control of money supply are provocative (to them) and will lead to a far less receptive response than a more positive, collaborative approach.  

It would be great just to say FU to the government but this only delays adoption by years maybe decades.  Let's get a foothold into mainstream and then pull out the FU card."
"Then what do you mean real economics happens at margins. Explain again because, so far I've had explanations on marginalism, and examples of how you believe real economics happens at the margins, not a thought out explantion of what  your trying to say.

edit 2: you know fuck all economics, your points have been shittily explained with no clear understandable examples and sources and references that dont back up your point.

Sure you could adopt this somewhat more monotonous approach. But if you do I suggest you read the words out loud rather than in your head as suggested here. Our memory works better when we've verbalised words and heard them. 
"Plenty of solutions. The solutions are already here. What Blockstream is doing is step #1. Much, much more is to come. Eventually governments will move to ban all non regulated crypto. That doesnt make crypto go away. Other cryptos will still be used, but miners will have their operations raided, and people using them will be arrested and caged. Privacy tools *must* come. TOR and solutions of the like must be implemented for those mining the chains, or even running PoS nodes. Privacy is the key. The violence of the state knows no bounds and they will *never* give up power and control voluntarily. Thia is only the beginning of this journey.

Keep your head up, because they arent just threatened, the threat is palpable."
"In reading the comments,  I was unable to find the solution.  Has one been developed yet?

"> Skews the voting system? And do what- decrease the value of his coins :P? It is in Masternode owners best interest to increase the value of the coin and vote on proposals that would do that instead of harming themself.

Of course they will act in their best interest to keep the currency going and gain more money for themselves. But this is about *control*. At the end of the day the main developer wants *control*. You could say that Dash is centralised because the main developer can effect a large degree of control over the protocol. Eventually this only leads to oligarchy.

> I don't need to prove it. If you wanted to buy it you could do it then. Can you prove that Satoshi wasn't buying all Bitcoins from exchanges for the first couple of years to even further increase his holdings? It doesn't matter now. In 2023 you would still be mad that the bunch of people mined a lot of Dash at the beginning? Maybe still in 2030? 

We're not talking about an insignificant bunch of Dash premined at the beginning. We're talking about *25 percent* of the total current supply that is circulating. If you want to compare that to Satoshi who mined his coins *fairly* over a number of years then that's a silly comparison. It's theorised Satoshi has 1,000,000 coins so that as a percentage of the current circulating supply is less than 6%. See the difference? People can say the preminers just dumped them on the exchanges. No proof to that. They could have just moved the money around to make it look like that. In reality they wanted a 25% stake in a potentially global currency to try exert financial dominance or control over the world.

Avoid Dash, only harm can come from it."

Happy Cake Day!
I actually have some ideas where any individual could set up groups and then others can choose to be downstream of them (original owner can also choose to allow upstream). Individuals can set the rules to their groups and other people can decide to use those groups if they want to or migrate to other groups if they don't like the rulers.
a bad way of describing the competing BIPs that are potential upgrades to the protocol. 
"> I'm genuinely trying to understand why you are here making negative comments about it.

I am here to act as a rational voice. 

You don't go and talk in r/bitcoin to bad-mouth Bitcoin, because instead everbody does it here, stating that Bitcoin isn't the true vision, that it is corrupted, that LN is the banking system devil reincarnate, that people are being duped by censoship, that AXA are trying to take over crypto, that BTC doesn't care about the poor, that it's being jeapordised by the technocrats, that Core are evil, that Blockstream are even more so. 

It's a joke. 

The amount of shit that is peddled here as truth, in an attempt to try and dupe innocent folk is ridiculous. This is the propaganda channel, not the other  sub. 

The day BCH stops trying to convince the world that it is the 'true' Bitcoin, is the day I will let r/BTC and BCH continue on in their deluded peace. 

Until then, I am afraid you are going to hear my voice as the alternate side of your constantly regurgitated echo chamber argument."

Mike has done a lot to challenge my views, and he is probably the person in all the world I most admire... But... I think he has become a bit too cynical, just because at one point miners were not acting economically rashly.

Mining centralisation is inevitable, no matter what. If it is not mining data centres, then it will be botnets. The point is that just because mining is centralised, it does not mean that the entire coin is."
bad bot
Unfortunately, I think the other way had to be tried first. It had to be very clear that there was no way to come to a compromise with small-block fundamentalists.
Disagree.  There is large incentive for a masternode staking potentially millions to come to agreements and educate themselves so that they can avoid splitting the network and damaging their investments. 
I totally understand your apprehension and I agree that it's not a good method. But it is one method of governance that reduces (not eliminates!) our dependence on central decision making. If you have another suggestion that achieves this without relying on an external forum like reddit that could be censored, then I'd like to hear
Then why are they all mining BTC? 
It's network effect is insane. The current management can do what they want and Reddit will still have 10 years of runway just on network effect. It's a very effective tool, downvoting and upvoting is not perfect but I don't know a better system. Reddit is also incredibly addictive. Especially when you start getting a bit of attention through or because of it. 
"> You don't go and talk in r/bitcoin to bad-mouth Bitcoin,

Actually. 

Let's be clear about the reason why I don't go in r/bitcoin. It's because I am banned from there for attempting to talk about the original Bitcoin scaling plan and Bitcoin white paper. I did not comply with their false narrative and thus was shut out very quickly.

"...and if you have 20 degrees they still find a way to massively discredited you as the case with CSW. Think what you like of him, but this constant idea of discrediting individuals in any way that seems fit for certain powers is driven from elitists with heavy pockets and this is a classic strategy for clinging onto power.

This community needs to be far more aware of the methods employed by deep state operatives (yes they are real), and corporate operatives that seek to socially engineer outcomes. They are pretty damn successful at it as well, as evidenced by everything that happened during the Mike Hearn era and onwards."
"How has it grown? You mean the market cap? Wow. 

Compared to the pace and acceleration of development on BCore related projects in the early years and also its adoption and usage as Peer To Peer Electronic Cash it has withered rather than grown."
"The present ""Rothschild controlled"" fiat money based system is remarkably similar to a PoS system.  PoS has no peaceful mechanism for regaining control from  ""bad"" stake holders.  Fiat money has no mechanism for regaining control from ""bad""  central bankers except war, possibly even global thermonuclear war.  PoW based systems can be more peacefully resolved by application of hashing machinery and electric power.

"> After Blockstream successfully took over Bitcoin Core and expelled anyone who opposed them, Gavin and I forked Bitcoin Core to create Bitcoin XT, the first alternative node implementation to gain any serious usage. The creation of XT led to the imposition of censorship across all Bitcoin discussion forums and news outlets, resulted in the creation of this sub, and **Core supporters paid a botnet operator to force XT nodes offline with DDoS attacks**. 

Seems like the support of a mining giant (Jihan) was important to the early survival of Bitcoin Cash."
"As with everyone else. I want to say thanks for all the hard work you and Gavin did back in the day. We would not be here without you.

"That video is such a joke. This guys intentionally mixed truth with lies and with his wild assumptions- it was debunked in dash subreddit a long time ago.

To keep the history short- there was no premine (but a group of people mined a lot of coins in the first hours), shortly after a huge amount of coins where traded on the exchanges with volume unmatched for many months (cause back then it was just another shitcoin). 

The whole thing is well known to the whole Dash community and is even explained on the official Dash website- nothing is hidden or censored regarding this case. 

Why Dash community isn't hiding it? Because if you investigate the case thouroughly you will came to assumption that is really doesn't matter after 4 years. If you wanted to you could buy masternodes for pennies at the beggining, and for $3000 for many months after that."
"I was there supporting Mike during the whole shitshow and I largely agree with his assessment. What worries me is what we could have possibly gotten wrong.  
1. What if the primary utility value of Bitcoin is not use in transactions?
2. What if we got the economics wrong? For example the classic economic equation MV=PQ implies that an increase in transactions (which is positively correlated with an increase in velocity) acts as effectively an increase in coin supply so by suppressing transactions, core contributed to Bitcoin's utility as a store of value.
3. What if overvalue some of the factors that contribute to utility present in Dash and undervalue the factors (such as superior infrastructure) present in Bitcoin?

Overall I think Hearn is right and Dash has a significant long-term advantage.  The lack of sophistication of new investors, short-term thinking of momentum-chasing day traders, and the greater number of fiat on-ramps pushed Bitcoin over the top and will keep it there for a time. As Dash catches up however, we can expect to see a whittling away of BTC market share, provided Dash core meets its development goals and we can find and choose a marketing method that results in a self-perpetuating ROI as the treasury grows.

The biggest problem I see going forward has little to do with Bitcoin other that to note that it has the same issue: volatility. A store of value coin is not as handicapped by volatility as one designed to actually be used as a currency. A tricked out UX like Evolution won't change that. We need good traders to buy the dips and sell the peaks, make profits and eat vol. It's a huge opportinity for people who know what they are doing or who get lucky and it is a minefield for those who don't.  "

The quest for power over others is a sign of weakness, when you're strong you don't need to rule over others, you aren't scared of them and so you don't need to subdue them to your will to feel safer about your survival. But those that want to rule will have a harder time ruling over others when they lose control of money. And those that want to be ruled will come to realize that they have nothing to fear by having more control over their lives, on the contrary. And those that want to be left alone will have just that.

"I think one of the great things about crypto is that it allows us to question our precepts and examine the underlying realities. Not just of currencies (particularly fiat) but of the nature of social interaction and group dynamics. Exciting stuff.

Social scientists' careers could be made on this if they can get past ""that's nerd stuff""."
That is my hope.
"There's a lot of great info here so I'll ask something else that many of us have wondered, as we all wish we could've been part of it back then.

How much btc do you have?"
Do you think threre is more than 0.1% change that Craig it's satoshi?
I figure that there are those that want to rule, those that want to be ruled and those that just want to be left alone. Unfortunately the first group uses the second group to control the third.

"> Perhaps the top priority for the Bitcoin Cash community should be to find a replacement for reddit. 

I so agree with this but it won't be easy. The network effect of Reddit is insane. And the way it's structured with up and downvotes is not perfect but I don't know any website that does it better. Reddit is also very very addictive, at this point I feel that current manangemf of Reddit can go really really far before anything they do will start seeing a decline of users. It can probably run 10 years on only it's network effect.  I like Reddit. I wish there where a place like Reddit but better, but I don't know one. Normal forums just feel clumsy and burdensome compared to the way Reddit structures everything.  "
"I've been thinking a lot lately about what the properties of a good decentralized reputation system might be. I agree that we need to a way to crowd-source consensus about authority, not just for reddit, or bitcoin, but for the entire digital space. Corey Doctorow came up with Whuffy, and China is implementing it's own state-run reputation system, and I'm familiar with your ideas about liquid democracy you talked about earlier.

Is there a basic set of principles that you think make the foundation that any reputation system requires? What are they? Is there any hope for a merit/utility based reputation system that we can use to delegate authority?

Thanks for the AMA, it's nice to hear your thoughts about what's happened. One last question - given that you don't seem to have much hope for the future of BCH, do you have any suggestions? What should the focus be for people that want to see BCH succeed? Do you want to see BCH (or any other cryptocurrency) succeed?"
"I also agree. One of the first long video presentations I watched on Bitcoin was your [Bitcoin 2012 London presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD4L7xDNCmA).  I mean it was only 30 minutes but it was very inspirational and I remembered watching it multiple times over the years. I have seen it pop up all over the internet. 

Thanks for all the work you have done and for your integrity. "
"> Nobody did predict it so in some trivial sense it was hard.

I think I recall some people expressed some concerns. If fact, I think for some people the Bitcoin Foundation was viewed as the answer to that problem. Though it actually turned out that it just led some of the more moderate people to walk away from the actual levers of power."
we lost a lot of good people from this stuff. Who remembers goat?
And the drive for Bitcoin evangelism towards buyers and sellers to try this stuff out is strong in our community. It's long road ahead but I still feel confident we can accomplish something.

I second that. Though many blamed you, Mike, for being “dramatic” with the Hearnia exit, I saw a different picture. Level-headed, hard-working, for little credit. Thanks for what you did for the community.

"It got ""debunked"" in the Dash subreddit. Sure, that's just whatever they want you to believe. Just perpetuating lies amongst their censored little filter bubble. Nobody else outside there is believing it.

The situation around the covert premine/fastmine/instamine/scam is that the founder _still_ has 256,000 Dash. What's he doing with all that? Just leaving it sitting in a wallet? That's 256 possible masternodes that could be earning for him. Seems illogical to just leave it in a wallet. Anyway that definitely skews the voting system.

Also can you _prove_ that all the premined coins actually got on exchange? Can you prove they were traded with someone else? Or were they just wash traded to make it look like the preminers got rid of their coins? I bet the majority of the preminers still have most of their coins as that was the main goal in the beginning.

Dash is a garbage coin. Dump it while you still can."
"Uncle rate with Ethereum's GHOST is not equivalent to Bitcoin's orphan rate. Ethereum's orphan work is not wasted. Here is an old beginner-friendly intro: https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/07/11/toward-a-12-second-block-time/

Though you're right that 0 conf is more reliable in BCH, the state of fast ETH confirmations is not quite as much worse as the comment suggests."
"Reading this article, I came across the most important statement you made within:

> Making miners ignore the “chronological order of transactions” by default converts them all into dishonest attackers, which would break the system completely."
"Thanks for giving everyone in the Bitcoin Cash community some things to think about. With the recent conflicts with some of BCH's resident ""experts"", it is good to remember that we are not immune from the mistakes of the past.

"Damn I lost u/mike_hearn AMA.

Well, just for the record, the BCH community deeply miss you man! Wouldn't hurt to chime in once in a while ;).

Kudos"
It's yet to be seen (we have BTC *and* BCH and more than 1500 alts) but I think it's quite possible that will turn out to be the case (and I don't want it to be but it's important to take reality as it is).
At this point, blocks were full, fees were rising, user experience diminishing, and ETH and other coins were gaining tons of traction very quick.  Some miners (ViaBTC) saw the writing on the wall that Bitcoin could be the next MySpace.
If one keeps pouring water in a mug, eventually it overflows (unless it's one of those MtGox mugs with a hole at the bottom).
"Bitcoin Cash is a full-on fork. I could appreciate what Mike was trying to do with XT. And then others with Classic and BU. It absolutely had to be tried. But to me, it was clear that a fork was the only way to resolve this. Even if Core and/or supporters weren't pulling all the dirty tricks and censorship, this division of ideals would only really be solved one way and that's by people on the opposing sides going their separate ways.

That's the glory of crypto and permissionless systems. There's no one to make you go one way or the other. Honest Bitcoiners should celebrate the fork."
"Hey Mike

Just wanted to say thanks for everything you did. I remember back when you left, I read your post and was angry. Bitter even. In the past year I've come to realize how hard all that you did must have been. Many are carrying the torch onwards tho and I hope you'll pop in from time to time to say hi. Just honoured to be a part of the community that was so heavily inspired by Gavin and yours ongoing battle for global scaling. 

Thanks again! $1 /u/tippr"
"Perhaps this is the reason that the majority of the world still lives under totalitarian government, and all of the world has done for the vast majority of history. I think that no matter what systems we build in order to protect freedom or decentralization, if people are not ready to live in freedom (without authority telling them what to do), psychologically or otherwise, then it will be for nought. For example, the US constitution was written to safeguard the US as a bastion of liberty for centuries to come, and yet most of that liberty was dismantled and what little remains is under threat.

From personal experience I can say that being involved with Bitcoin has taught me a lot and changed my thinking profoundly. I think that 'converting' people to Bitcoin takes more than just setting them up with a wallet and selling them a few coins."
"It's not going to happen with Reddit though.

I think Usenet has a lot to offer in the way of ideas. It needs some decentralization bolted on but it's a reasonable model to begin from."
"And we will win. We will make Satoshi, you and Gavin proud. Thanks for your contribution to this project.

Love your work mate. I try to spread your blogs to every camp i can find in twitter. i may seem like a spammer to some. but i think your words are critical to understanding the truth and history of bitcoin! So thank you. 
Many of us are aware that Bitcoin XT was instrumental in that happening.
In corda is there a concept of chain reorgs? If a new client is synicing in how do they tell which corda chain to download?
I'll give you the first one. Intel's response is not something I really dug into, and it's not something I plan to dig into in the near future. I suppose we'll have to disagree on the second one. I have a hard time believing something so comically insecure and fiendishly hard to disable was not intentional. Given that, it doesn't matter much to me that the particular hole we know about doesn't affect the SGX. I simply can't trust that Intel has not included similar backdoors/exploits in other places, especially in something as privacy oriented as SGX.
Wow.
We've slowly been building and trying to rekindle hopes for on-chain scaling.  Seeing Mike's hopes rekindled reminds me of Gandalf and Pippin lighting the flames calling for Rohan to come to Gondor's aid.  Hope lives!
This, one thousand times this! What happened to that guy who called GMax toxic. What happened to turn him from saying that decentralisation was a scale to him saying that BCH is throwing decentralisation out the window?

"DO you prefer wood chopsticks or plastic chopsticks. 

Also, I found an old drive from my windows computer with bitcoin core from 2009 on it with 2 btc. I had the keys and address stored on the desktop in a wordpad document apparently. Used Electrum and restored the wallet and it worked! (thats how I found I had 2 btc on it) the good ole days. "
Hey this guy's not a BCH'er. Can we get a mod in here to censor him? /s
"Are you aware of the so-called ""UASF"" campaign (""UASF"" stands for what they call a ""user activated soft fork"", which is the idea of nodes activating new consensus rules regardless of what any of the miners signal or do)? You can see a list of developers who vouched for the idea here: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Segwit_support (everyone who isn't marked either red or grey in both the BIP 148 and BIP 149 columns, the two being two versions of SegWit UASFs). They did release alternative node software which implemented this fork and promoted it on r/Bitcoin, Bitcointalk, etc., with the approval and even active protection from the moderators there (censoring of opposition, I speak first hand and it is documented).

What do you think of this? When did you learn of this? Wouldn't you have something to say about this act and the people who did it?"
What is in the special sauce on a Big Mac okay maybe I don't want to know
If Bitcoin had not met your criteria for failure back when you made that famous post, where would you expect it to be today?
I think there are a lot of people in the bitcoin cash community doing everything they can to ensure that your hard work does not go to waste. It's the least we can do to thank you for your efforts.
"> You may be right but at the time XT was programmed to do nothing until, iirc, 75% of hash power was voting for the change. And then there was a grace period before the hard fork happened. So a miner switching to XT would not have risked losing any money. 

Would you recommend a similar system for governing Bitcoin Cash upgrades? It seems that most people in the Bitcoin Cash community don't care about signalling any more, perhaps because of the SegWit2x failure despite overwhelming positive signalling."
I don't understand how you get around not using proof-of-work. How is decentralization made possible in Corda?
The solution of course is to implement a secret ballot. This can be done with homomorphic encryption.
Would anonymous voting alleviate this issue at all?
