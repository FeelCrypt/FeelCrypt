"Unless he clearly makes a 'boycott /r/bitcoin' policy for Blockstream, it is just lip service.
I have yet to hear a response to this:

"I'd like to see links to where he ""strongly denounced it"".

>Please don't call me disingenuous when you don't know all of the facts and are filling in the blanks with assumptions.

No one can know what they don't know. If something else was said somewhere where I haven't read then fair enough but I can only go on what I *have* read/witnessed."
Be aware that it's easy to dismiss statements as being 'not serious' after you're caught making them. Politicians do this all the time, as you know.
"You can't really make a call for a coup against protocol consensus to force a change and not expect it to be ""censored"".  Will someone provide an example of something that shouldn't have been removed?  Maybe there is a thread that should be stickied of ""lost information"""
Can you give a quote or link?
Well, I do hope you'll put your energy into helping more than Core. Regardless, I'm glad you're here.
"> Well, I do hope you'll put your energy into helping more than Core.

The irony of that statement is that /u/rnicoll one of the core developers of DOGE. Also develops [CATE](https://github.com/rnicoll/cate) (cross-chain atomic transaction engine)."
Are you a contributor to Core? I don't recognize your account, sadly.
I would say you count as a core bitcoin developer, but you're clearly not part of Core in the pejorative sense of the group of people who seem to be doing everything they can to prevent Bitcoin from ever raising the blocksize cap.
"It wasn't on IRC that he strongly denounced it. It was later on Reddit.

There is only one alert key. It does not belong to Theymos in any sense, he just has access to it along with Gavin, satoshi, Wladimir and possibly others. [Changing the alert key on one client version could actually clog the network](https://github.com/bitcoinclassic/bitcoinclassic/issues/27#issuecomment-172995064).

I was enjoying the anonymity :-D I do also work on bitcoinj, which I think at the moment is probably the simplest directly Bitcoin thing for me to contribute to
He's been paid by scammers before, I think it's safe to assume he's being paid to censor in the same way someone was paid to ddos.
"Words are cheap. Actions matter. If you use a censored forum you implicitly are agreeing that it's not bad enough to use an alternative, especially when one like this place exists.

And to make matters worse, you never ever ever seen him or any other 'champion of free speech' in Blockstream attack Theymos or a mod directly. If they really don't like what's going on and think it's bad, why not say it to the guy's face?

Either they're cowards afraid of being banned by a child, or they're complicit and saying things to win political points without any real cost to them, which is *exactly what politicians caught with their pants down do*.

Fuck everything about that."
Oh that's interesting. Should probably change that to support multiple keys to avoid transferring private keys. 
Amen.  I couldn't have said it better myself.
"Here's where he denounces censorship: https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/662634557393514496

It seems his refusal to criticize was actually editorial: https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/3z6a1k/adam_back_condones_censorship/

I can't find anywhere where he has actually refused to criticise theymos, so that may just be my own conclusion. Here's the closest I can find; there's a lot more around that time if you want to dig through them all: https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/662183732468666368"
They don't financially benefit at all. Bitcoin Core devs, including those involved in Blockstream, are heavily invested in BTC, and Blockstream as a company is heavily dependent on growth in the Bitcoin userbase for growth in its market. Both the value in BTC and the size of the userbase will suffer with community strife and a heavily restricted block size.
Not one of the major ones, certainly, but I have stuff in most recent releases. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/graphs/contributors says 34th
I was censored. I complained about it. Fuck you. 
You should really join bitcoin classic. We need to get bitcoin back on track.

">2:04 am gmaxwell phantomcircuit: **pedantically**, it would no longer be free software; and doing that would be imposing a huge analysis cost of anyone else using the software; not a good tradeoff.

How the fuck is this being ""strongly denounced"". He basically said that saying the code is no longer open source is just being ""pedantic"" and that the problem with doing this would be that it would have higher analysis costs. i.e. if the analysis costs would not be high would be a good idea.

You're the one being disingenuous now aminok.

It's not that bad. We have some pretty interesting scams:D
rofl... well played.
Yes, and that's the insanity isn't it?
You complained about censorship on r/btc ? Please don't. Swear at me :)
Fuck theymos.
