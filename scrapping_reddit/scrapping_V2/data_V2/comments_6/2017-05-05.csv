"I'm saying without a majority, more strategy is needed to create a split.

The assumption is that miners are rational, which leads to a majority rule outcome, where the minority loses when committing effort against the grain.

But in reality some miners are irrational, and willing to mine for ideological reasons at an economic loss, so a chain split is possible.

Therefore the real battle is between the two groups of irrational miners on each side of the issue.  The rest will just go along for the ride on the chain that provides an economic incentive.

Why can't someone include this transaction in a single large block and then go back to having all future blocks be small again?
Interestingly, with the SIGOP limit, no increase in block size will ever be able to spend this.   Even after increasing the block size... most proposed upgrades (BU/Classic/BIP103... everything), have SIGOP limits.   
Yeah? So ethereum *did* switched to PoS? Okay.
If your are on blockstream payroll..
Just to trying to clarify - so you're saying that, because there is no real long term monetary incentive here, it simply won't happen, because miners would have to commit to mining a chain that, without others joining them in doing so, will eventually end up being a waste of computational power and time, because *other* miners have no incentive to follow them in mining that chain, and even if such a fee were somehow split (as I saw someone explaining earlier), it would eventually become so negligible an amount, that the risk of mining a chain that might be orphaned in the future would outweigh that reward?

> For censorship resistance, we need on-chain scaling, because the blockchain is the only distributed network we have.

We (probably) do need on-chain scaling, but not for censorship resistance. Bigger blocks *will* have a centralizing effect. Unbounded blocksize increases as a scaling solution (like BU proposes) will have the ultimate centralizing effect. If you want an on-chain increase: SW more or less doubles the blocksize, as you know.

Fair point. What I meant is that I think the attitude of ""this is a meritocracy, people skills don't matter the better tech will win in the end"" is really harmful here. These are very complex and confusing issues, and trolling on all sides just makes it hard. You also have to realize that 99.9% of people can't or won't take the time to really understand these changes, so there is a definitely level of trust or faith involved. It's simply too complex, and the idea that every user runs a full node and audits the code and understands that they are totally safe is bunk. Real people don't operate that way, they need to have some faith / trust in someone (or some group).

> I know the simplicity of bigger blocks = more transactions = more users = higher price is appealing. I was in that camp.

I still am, maybe you can convince me the rest of the way. The way I see it is this: we can immediately increase block size to increase transactions (and eventually price) to continue the exponential scaling of bitcoin. This is not free, it means that it's harder for people to run nodes, so fewer people will, and more users will rely on ""trust"" in some form (but there will still be hundreds or thousands of nodes, so it's not much faith that people need). On the other hand, keep the block size as it is (or shrink it maybe?) so people can run their nodes longer. Not much of a debate to me...."
"How do you figure that? Miners can change any rules they want, regardless of what the full node operators want.

SegWit is a solution for many problems. They realized they could increase blocksize as a soft fork only in the later stages. It's an added bonus. Ironically, if they hadn't touched the blocksize, SegWit would probably already be active.

If people use non-mining, validating nodes, instead of SPV wallets then mining nodes do not have the ability to unilaterally change aspects of the consensus layer.

"I'm not predicting the future anymore than you lot are. If you think it's incorrect to say hard drives will be big enough to hold the Blockchain, then you need to get out of the bitcoin game. BU or core, the block chain is going to keep growing.

And in regards to the rest of your comment that seemed to expect me to respond to challenges that weren't made:

Bigger blocks does mean more computational power, but that's not what BU does. It's not a big block protocol. It just sets the blocksize based on the market. It is in miners best interest to keep the network working, so they have zero incentive to raise the blocksize above what the full nodes can handle.

And beyond that, the computational load is really not that great, even with significantly larger blocks. Network speed is a bigger bottle neck, but for the exact same reasons you think hard drives will no longer grow in capacity, network speed will likely get much faster. If everyone is using cloud storage, internet speeds have to increase to meet that demand."
"It's not that simple.

The extra megabytes want to be transmitted again and again for bootstrapping other clients or relaying -> more network bandwidth.

Those extra megabytes also need to be verified -> more CPU usage.

Cheaper transactions will result in more transactions (not necessarily with any additional economical value, see wasteful implementations of bitcoin gambling sites in the past -- people are lazy if they can be) -> more RAM for a bigger mempool.

Any future improvement (e.g. privacy enhancements) that has a flipside of increasing transaction size might be dead on arrival if the base layer is too big.

If at any point the blockchain exceeds the size of what consumer targeted HDDs provide, it might get expensive very very fast. (E.g. with cloud storage getting more popular and compression better all the time, consumers might continue to value speed over size (see SSDs). This might make large local disks hard to sell in the future and vendors might stop producing them in huge volumes and offering them for the prices we're accustomed to.)

Bottom line: you can't predict the future, better tread carefully here."

>  In second place if number of Transactions grows its only logical the blocksize have to increase. 

Sure, but I would like the number of transactions to grow in the most effective way. This might not be on-chain for every single transaction - Lightning Network and similar technologies look very interesting because it can leverage much of the burden that fullnodes have.

Well personally I don't think sidechains are that interesting, because of the inconvenience of moving between chains.

> Why do you need even full nodes at home? Run it in pruned mode and you're good to go forever.

Being able to independently run a fullnode to verify the blockchain is the essence of Bitcoin, once this ability doesn't exist anymore, no one cannot make sure that Bitcoin isn't being malleated. For me, making sure anyone can run a fullnode is really _really_ important.  
Edit: Oh yes agree, pruned node at home makes more sense.

> Run it in pruned mode and you're good to go forever. 

Sure, you're right. The storage constraint is partly* fixed by pruning.

\* partly because IBD (Intial Block Download) still requires a full download of the blockchain before pruning.

I could keep up with all the transactions in the world-wide currency Bitcoin by means of a single floppy by manually copying new blocks are they arrive😏
Smthing is wrong with your clock..
Hahah!
lol. nice. 
"I still have mine labeled ""A1"", ""A2"", A3"", ""D1"", ""D2"", ""N1"" .... downloaded over a whooping 9600 terminal line connected over Frame Relay :)"
how long to download on 14.4k modem tho ?
"So segwit is the ""quadruple density"" 2.88MB floppies?"
oh man BTCC should have sold the halvening block on a floppy disk instead of the other collectible.

LOL! That was savage
Yeah OK, but now make a couple of thousands of copies and send them all around the world. Oh, and by the way, they're supposed to arrive in the next couple of minutes, so better get started early.
"5.25"" HD was 1.2MB -- so even that is embarrassingly large ."
His Commodore still works fine, why throw it out?
One Meg Greg and 360kJr holding back Bitcoin scaling...
If you're European.  ~80,000 floppy disks if you're American.
For not being mindless religious cultists?
Psychoanalysis studies would beg for some moments of your time for research. 
lol
"You're confused about what Bitcoin is

hint: it's not a program"
Super cool delusion bro.
"Here is a thought experiment:
In the 50s, Moa instated the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Flowers_Campaign, then killed everyone that criticized the government.  Today there are many statues of Mao.

Here is the question, if you kill everyone who opposes a government - does that mean it's the kind of government that everyone likes?

What if, for example, there is a place called America.  In America people frequently cannot believe the human rights atrocities that have happened in China.  

Does that mean that all American people hate all Chinese people? "
"How could you even think that is possible? This sub obviously cares enough about Bitcoin enough to create a subreddit in which people are permitted to freely talk about Bitcoin.

If anything it is the mods of r/Bitcoin that hate Bitcoin. That is why they do not permit people to talk freely about Bitcoin.

Maybe if you understood Bitcoin and the networking issues involved you would understand that there is nothing to lose, and much to gain by increasing the block size."
"I don't know why clueless people like you constantly ignore the facts, just to repeat the same bullshit over and over.  

First, there is a difference between *maximum* blocksize and the actual size of a block. Even if we'd increase maxsize to 8MB now, blocks would be slowly starting to grow, probably reaching 2 or 3 MB until end of year.  

Second, chainsize will be a problem in some years, yes. There are some solutions to this already discussed. The most elegant IMHO is Mimblewimble, which even has a proof-of-concept implementation as of today. Just google it or search the last week of reddit posts. I'm quite certain that it will be production ready well before any chainsize could become critical (because it has other advantages as well, like privacy).
"
Downloading that isn't necessary with utxo commitments.
500gb a year is nothing. Even if we assumed that technology will halt in its advance, 500gb drive is pretty cheap.
Yeah and his dial up modem is 300 baud.
That is a LOT of floppys.  Probably enough to fill a house.
">Suppose we increase it to 10MB, that would be 500GB per year. Would you really be okay with that?

[Uh, yes.](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Portable-External-Drive-WDBUZG0010BBK-WESN/dp/B00CRZ2PRM/)"
No it's still only 1 floppy but you have to buy 4 and throw 3 away
I could have sworn that's what this thread was about. Thanks for making it right Zuen56.
Double the capacity solved all storage problems.

"We can't have nice things like that because LukeJr still hasn't upgraded from 5.25""."
Throw it in an envelope with a 34-cent postage stamp and it'll be cheaper too.
If centralization is not a problem it can handle larger blocks
Latency *will* affect propagation.  It already does.
"> Anyone who tells you otherwise has something to gain off of limiting Bitcoin's on-chain growth

Absolutely correct. We all do: censorship resistance. The only thing that makes bitcoin special. Why is the sub that heavily decries /r/bitcoin censorship not getting this?

[Roger discredits non-mining full nodes](https://twitter.com/rogerkver/status/853250894162350080) and prefers to trust miners, like Jihan who could easily be coerced or coopted into censoring transactions, force privacy weakening changes or resist privacy enhancing ones. This anti core movement is so misguided. Like poor or sick people voting for Trump.

Drawing comparisons to floppy disks is funny and it's a comparison easy to grasp for the uninitiated, but it's also ignorant of technical realities. Did you know that the ""TCP/IP blocksize"" is usually around 1400bytes? And yet here we are, 4k video streaming for a few bucks a month. (This is also a bad analogy for various reasons, but definitely not worse than the floppy one.)

And now go ahead, let your amygdala click the downvote button."
Ether has a maximum throughput of ~3.5 mb per 10 minutes.  Litecoin 3 mb per 10 minutes.
"Go look at the numbers right now.  BTC has gone below 60% market dominance and keeps reaching new lows. Volume suggests most are only buying Bitcoin to get into other coins. The strongest pair by volume is in fact ETH/BTC which is rising.

The writing is on the wall, USD valuation be damned, there is a mass exodus from BTC occuring right now. Ethereum is catching a lot of the new money, and old money is changing hands. 

Personally I am fine with Greg and the gang holding the bag, fuck the lot of them, this is what they deserve. If Bitcoin is remembered the same way as Netscape so be it. "
litecoin and eth - both of which don't have malleability bugs - are basically taking over, and you're chuckling about floppy disks and blaming lukejr.   segwit is ready now.   your mythic hard forks are not.  
So 500gig per year my current machine can hold 24 years of data
You would need about 85,000 of those in order to keep the entire chain of blocks. And about 144 are added each day.
