The issue is not your money, it is the vast amount of fake money that gets pumped into the property market.
"> I'm just saying this narrative doesn't work in the U.S

There's nothing unique about US finance industry. Pyramids are bigger, that's all. Each fiat system is doomed to fail. Let's hope Bitcoin will stop its reboots once and for all"
">  If that happens, you will have far larger problems to worry about. 

You do realize those ""bigger problems to worry about"" ***are*** the reasons bitcoin exists in the first place right?

Satoshi wasn't exactly coy about it."
In different categories.  Banks lump all checking/cd/ira (if they are standard certificate) etc together. Better check with a financial advisor.  
"Banks have a flaw which works against something with a cap, like Bitcoin. And that flaw is in the way interest works. Banks have products, in some ways no different than going to a retailer and buying something off the shelf. What they sell is money, and they only ask that you pay them later instead of right up front.

There is an expectation that you will be able to cover your debt because you are going to be paid by someone who has also barrowed. As a result banks will accumulate wealth and make the resource more rare, increasing its value, and making it less liquid. This was the problem with the gold standard and why governments issue fiat currency.

Lending institutions need to stick with fiat because there needs to be a way to always introduce more currency into the system to suppress that inflation. The federal reserve and international banks set those rates to stimulate circulation.

I think the advantage that cryptocurrencies represent is that we have a way to completely change how things are done. This means that whenever financial institutions try to adopt cryptocurrencies I have to be leary and suspicious of their motives, because their business models don't work with this emerging market and instead we need to implement new tools."
"Yes most of my money is withdrawn from my bank except that which I need to spend. My savings in shares, Bitcoin and real work assets. 

Only fiat I own is just to pay my taxes obviously"
"Well, it is a fact that people don't own money as they put it in a bank. That can easily be validate by anyone interested.

I kind a agree with OP that people weren't aware of another fact: Personal data ownership on Facebook and that what is going on lately is opening their eyes. Hopefully they will have ""A-HA"" moment about banks as well. 

One could argue that moment already happened, just look at genesis block of bitcoin. :)"
Funny.  It looked more like a capitulation tag.  
"Central banks have collapsed before without the entire planet reverting to Mad Max.

You aren't making any sense."
"Wow, that's a wall of text. Let me break it down for you one by one.

>Someone better tell all the people who were defrauded by banks like Wells Fargo

Banks are bailed out by the government, so they can't go bankrupt. They might as well be a branch of the government. It's problem with government, not with private companies.

>How about all the people living next to, or in, superfund sites

You can look at most of these and generally the government licensed or authorized the companies to do these things. When things go bad the government protects them from liability. Since the homes of the people in these areas are rendered worthless, they can't afford to move elsewhere. It's problem with government, not with private companies.

>Lest we forget, the neverending cycle of drug reformulation that allows pharmaceuticals to prevent competing drugs and generics from ever reaching the market

You need look no farther than the government run patent system and the overly stringent FDA requirements for new drugs. ""Regulatory capture"" - look it up. Once again it's problem with government, not with private companies.

>Oh the hundreds of housing companies that popped up and literally bought entire housing districts

Trace it back, Who caused the housing crisis? it's problem with government, not with private companies.

>How about predatory, one-sided contracts? You might have something here, however, this is really only a problem in a market with labor shortages. And who is generally responsible for shitty economic environments? I think you can figure it out.

I'm not saying private companies don't do bad things, My point is that when they do, the market will weed them out. And this generally happens before any really bad things happen like you describe above. The only time the market can't do this is when the government steps in and prevents the market from doing what it does best, reward those who serve their customers and eliminate those who don't. "
"You still have your bank account, and that was exactly my point. There are reasons why people still need to use banks. 

People who use banks are not ""idiot who deserves to lose your funds"". Even if you don't trust banks and governments it's not something you can do away with. Just telling them they're idiots only alienates them form Bitcoin, unless that's your intention."
"So to be clear, it's not meant to be an anonymous form of value and payment which isn't dependent on banks/government to use in transactions?  It's a doomsday currency?

But, if that's what you honestly believe is going to happen, you'd do better to invest in seeds, goats, water, a shelter and lots of guns and ammo.  "
So tell me how we can use bitcoin in the economic wasteland without electricity?

Why are you jumping straight from banks collapsing to Mad Max?
"Over simplify if you like.

Context is for kings."
The United States government (FDIC, Federal Reserve, etc.) is part of the financial system. So for the entire financial system to collapse, the United States government must also collapse. 
"Well recently there was the Greek ""haircut"", and the Venezuelans have the hyper inflation.

Hedging against fiat was the entire reason Satoshi created bitcoin in the first place.

"> because banks have obligation to pay back to you

No, read TOS carefully. Cyprus' ""cuts"" as an example"
"Sorry but Banks are basically Tether but they openly admit to operating on a fractional reserve.

In Australia banks don't have a monetary reserve ratio requirement. They get by on 2-3% reserve at least for the banks I looked at.

It suprising how many people blindly support the banking industry without understanding the complex monetary policy of thier country.

>Too many self-proclaimed libertarians don't truly understand why we have banks and governments and just mindlessly blame them, and I think that's very counter-productive thing to do

I am supprised that there so many pro establishment comments being upvoted."
"Hey man, I went through exactly the same phase as you are right now, and can tell you for sure that things are not as simple as it seems.

When I first learned about how fractional reserve banking works, and how nation states keep making the same mistake of printing money throughout the ENTIRE HISTORY of humanity, without ever learning their lesson from history, I thought it was hilarious. But once you study this deeper and learn about the entire historical background behind why all this happened, you understand why these things happened. Of course there were cases in history where the monarchs just printed money for their own greed, but this was not always the case, especially after Keynes.

That said, I DO believe in Austrian economics, I'm just saying--borrowing your own words--you shouldn't blindly support certain idea without understanding the entire background as a whole. To understand this you need to understand not just economics, but also world history from the very beginning of civilization to the current era.

Before criticizing others for ""blindly supporting"" something, it might be better to look back at yourself and see if you are not being blind."
Wow how did so many pro banking people get into Bitcoin, probably this year right. They don't even know why Bitcoin was created. 
"Blindly supporting anything is bad. Banks have a purpose in creating credit. However they have a monopoly which Bitcoin is countering. 

It is good you did your research, but assuming all anti bank people haven't is also wrong.

Your sarcastic comment didn't add context or address my post.  But really, it's silly to argue with a doomsday nut on matters of commerce, so I'm gonna move on.
“Libertarian” that’s a bug not a feature. 
I work on a Bitcoin library, and I'm also working on an app on top of Bitcoin. I am not pro-bank, if that's your takeaway from my comment, then it tells more about you than me.
"Lol I can't believe people like you buy Bitcoin. You have so much faith in your bank but you can't even tell me what it's balance sheet is.

It's disgusting that so much of the newcomers don't understand why Bitcoin was created"
"Until they run out of money. The FDIC itself only holds a factional reserve.

The FDIC is to keep one bank crashing from causing a run. It's meaningless in a systemic collapse."
"> Blindly supporting anything is bad. Banks have a purpose in creating credit. However they have a monopoly which Bitcoin is countering.

we really don't need to fight because we both agree on this.

> It is good you did your research, but assuming all anti bank people haven't is also wrong.

I didn't assume this about anti-banks people, I just said if you looked harder into the entire history you would get a more complete picture of why we are where we are.

And just to be clear, I myself AM anti-bank. I know it immediately may sounds like I'm some pro-bank bitcoin newbie who just got into Bitcoin a couple of months ago just to make quick bucks, but I am not. It's really hard to come to a bitcoin forum and talk about how banks do provide benefit without sounding like a clueless pro-bank guy, but I hope I am making myself clear: Banks DO have benefits and that's why people use them. All I'm trying to point out is how dangerous it is to just mindlessly think that EVERYTHING about banks is bad and banks are some organizations we need to kill off. Banks are not enemies. They are just a bad system. And like we agree, Bitcoin will solve this because the fundamentally centralized structure won't fix itself.

> Your post is ironic because I bet you haven't even looked at your banks balance sheet because at least I have.

You make accusations about me making assumptions but you're also making assumptions. I have looked at my bank balance sheet. In fact I try my best to remove my dependence on banking and credit system. For example I don't own a credit card and my credit score is shit. But this is what I believe in.

> I for one actually looked at my banks balance sheet ( public records ). What more research does one need...

It's not just about looking at the current situation. My point was that everything exists for a reason. And before you tell me I'm rationalizing why banks are a good thing, again, that's not what I'm saying. If people use Facebook even though they all feel unhappy, there DOES exist a reason why they do so. If people use banks even though they don't like them, there DOES exist a reason for that. And if you just ignore all that and just say ""You're an idiot if you use Facebook"" or ""You're an idiot if you use banks"", you will never see the fundamental problem. And what I'm suggesting is that a thorough study of the entire history is very helpful in understanding these."
"If you read rest of my comments on this thread, you'll see how I totally acknowledge that ""You can't trust governments and banks"" is very true in rest of the world, and is one of the most beautiful things about Bitcoin. So we agree on that.

I'm just saying this narrative doesn't work in the U.S. and other relatively stable countries. If we really want Bitcoin to succeed, just reiterating ""governments are evil and banks steal your money"" in the U.S. and other relatively economically stable countries won't do it. Actually doing so is counter-productive because in the eyes of most U.S. citizens this is nothing more than a ""conspiracy theory"" and that's why you see no-coiners accusing bitcoiners as being mindless speculators. If you want to win, you need to know your enemy.  Actually, to win, you shouldn't treat others like an enemy. Everyone is in this together. That's all I'm saying."

"Yeah I didn't buy Bitcoin because I hate the government. If that's the reason why you bought Bitcoin, then you're doing it wrong. yAlso, I probably distrust the government much more than you do, I went through a lot of shit in my life which most ordinary people haven't had to live through. It is you who is accusing me of ""trusting the government"", where did I say you should trust the government and banks?

And I chuckle at you calling me a ""newcomer"". I am pretty sure I bought Bitcoin years before you did because I truly believed in its disruptive technology, and that disruptive technology is not what you think it is. 

So, did you or did you not withdraw all your money from the bank? Unless you answer this, this thread is really meaningless. If you DID withdraw 100% of your money from your bank, then i respect your conviction."
If you're in the US and your bank is a member of the FDIC, you don't need to worry about that.  The amount of money lost to bank failures since the inception of the FDIC compared to loss of money from the frauds and hacking of crypto are incomparable.  
The FDIC is ultimately backed by the US Government, the Dollar, and therefore the productive capacity and output of United States (which is ultimately what ALL fiat currency is backed by).  Planning for the FDIC to fail is to simultaneously plan for a collapse of the entire financial system.  If that happens, you will have far larger problems to worry about.  
"> We owe so much money around the world that can never be paid back

What you're forgetting is so do they.  

>The creditors will come for their money, they always do.

Sounds good.  So I owe you 10 and you owe me 5, and you're like ""I want my money"".  But my GDP is 100 and yours is 1.  Who is more fucked?"
