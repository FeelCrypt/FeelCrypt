Yay! Celebrate by buying $100 BTC in support! Go Bitcoin!
I just joined this sub, but all in on the true BTC! BTC is BTC!
If they are not accepting it, than it's a red flag and gtfo. 
Not rubbish,  I've been all over the dark net and they are sold all the time. Identity theft is big business. 
not 5k for a copy big
You should be cautious. If your data ends up in the wrong hands, than they can buy cars, houses and other expensive and illegal stuff on your name. You will get arrested for something you haven't done. And a heap of shit will follow.  You don't want that.. So f*ck them if they want your social security number. Internet is a dangerous place.  The watermark is there, so they can't copy your photo. So make sure you do that to. Identity theft is a pain in the butt if you have to deal with it. 
Cheers man, will do. Theres an Airdrop from Dfinity in the next couple of weeks and I was abit hesitant from just blindly giving out my ID. 
No, maybe not 5k for a single ID...but 5k for a handful of CC numbers, SSN, copies of IDs etc. 
T'was funny
Why don't people just freeze their credit? That solves having loans and credit cards being opened in your name.
Yes I am totally holding my breath for a reputable source on this.
Good advice, thanks. 
Kraken tier 2 verification doesn't require to send any documents copies over, and is enough to withdraw FIAT to bank account, at least if you live in Europe...
Huge security risk for the exchange yaaaa. Wtf r u even talking about.  It doesn’t matter to the user if they don’t check an id that well.  
I just need a solid source or it didn't happen.
The OP never claimed the image was authentic. Just used it to make a point. Giving a sketch as fuck exchange a photocopy of your ID and all your personal information is super risky. I just don't do it. 
WTH!!! srsly?  
I don't know if it's true or not. Just something I found on Twitter, but the point remains. Giving a random entity, like a sketch as fuck exchange, my personal information seems like a huge risk...one that is unnecessary.  
Always dedact your social security number and watermark your document with date and what it's for.
I understand, make a new name, be orginal instead of confusing everyone and cashing in on the same name that a cryptocurrency currently uses.
Yes, the name is Bitcoin Cash. The whole point of the fork is that our vision for bitcoin is no longer held back by yours. That means we don’t have to listen to what you think anymore. It doesn’t matter if you don’t like the name. Just like it doesn’t matter that you don’t understand bitcoin and don’t think it can scale. It can and it will. And you’re just going to have to deal with it. Sorry.
