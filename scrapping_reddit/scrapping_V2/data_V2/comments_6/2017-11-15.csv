"Hehe r/btc isnt that much different from r/bitcoin as people like to think. As soon as you mention something else you get downvoted.

so many things to mention, but my favorite parts are:
NEO is more like a share. And by holding NEO you get GAS as a dividend. I Sold all my mining equipment in the summer, and I make more from GAS than I did mining ethereum then. 
Gas will be used for the DAPPS and other things like voting.

It supports many different programming languages instead of just one. Which will make it a lot more reachable for programmers.

You should read up on it. Im not saying to go all in, but I think its a good idea to have some in the portfolio. "
"did you read what I wrote? I said NEO is more like share, and you ask for the same thing.

GAS is NOT pegged to fiat. You get GAS by holding NEO in your NEO wallet. "
"Just go to NEO on reddit and read it there. or watch some youtuber explain it in detail. 

GAS remains GAS. They are 2 seperate things, but connected to the same blockchain. 

You can sell your GAS and buy NEO for it, though."
"(I didn't downvote you)  

Give me the sales pitch- what is different about Neo / what's its claim to fame / why is it good / why should I buy it?  "
"Well there's two questions here- onramps/offramps, and transaction cost.  

As /u/jessquit was getting at, if the transaction cost is high, if the coin is treated like a digital investment that costs $5-$10 to transact (but nobody cares when they move $1000+ around at a time), then it is of no more use to someone in rural Zimbabwe than buying gold coins.  
OTOH if the transaction cost is low, then it becomes useful for day to day purchases.  

That leads into the second thing- onramps/offramps.  In many countries, converting between fiat and crypto is heavily regulated.  OTOH if you can transact purely in crypto, without ever needing to go back to fiat (you get paid in crypto and you buy things in crypto), that opens up all kinds of uses in developing markets and places with shitty economic policy / worthless fiat.  

That's what I think 'small blockers' miss- sure it's good to have a long term store of value, but that store of value becomes much more valuable when you can spend it on stuff.  "
"Sorry, I was reading a bunch of other random stuff on Google.  I guess some of it was wrong (gas fiat thing).  

So you hold Neo and you get GAS, does GAS become NEO?  Like your holdings of NEO will go up?  "
"> Stop listening to just reddit.

This may actually be good advice.  I've had a bit more time to watch crypto lately, and thus have been studying the space from a few different perspectives...  made me realize how compared to the 'old days' (2012-2014ish; pre-/r/bitcoin-censorship) a great deal of today's BTC/BCH discussion on Reddit is largely just reactionary noise.  

This last weekend's market moves I think are evidence of that.  I've looked over the charts and I don't think this was just a case of 'miners chase the block reward', it seems too well coordinated for that.  I think the miners (who are not stupid) had a pre-hardfork strategy to move hash power around during a period of high BTC network load and BCH uncertainty thus influence the price of both BTC and BCH.  This strategy was obviously quite successful.  At least that's my conclusion.  

But do we discuss that intelligently here?  Do we even acknowledge that miners might have a strategy behind what they do?  No of course not.  /r/btc says 'the flippening is happening!!!!11' and goes nuts, /r/bitcoin says 'Jihan and Roger are dishonest con men have fun with your tanking scamcoin suckers this is finally the end of fake satoshi's shitcoincash pump and dump scheme'.  
Neither one really adds much of anything useful.

Then I go even to subreddits of other cryptos and I see a whole different type of discussion- few memes / shitposts / low effort stuff, lots of people actually learning about the tech and asking smart questions and working on new solutions and figuring out how to push adoption.  It's really quite striking.  

Then again, maybe the Reddit BTC/BCH community is an analogue to modern America- we've become insular, focused on our own squabbles and ignoring the world at large...  kinda sad IMHO.

"> Which supply chains?

All. Food's is the most important, it'll affect social stability instantly. Read about famines in Soviet Union in USA in the first half of XX century. It has nothing to do with production capacity and all to do with prices, inflation of paper money and supply chains

> that doesn't stop governments from being able to tax people

Cos each big enough merchant had to have a bank account and a license. Open blockchains already are changing that. Merchants will go above all jurisdictions. Factories and fields will follow them in the 2nd stage (when police forces of nations will start to break down over financial turmoil, read about what's happening in Ukraine now). Thousands of businesses will be abandoned

Cos no agency on Earth would be able to trace anyone's personal finance if this person contribute a little effort to disentangle his identity public keys. Analitical graph'll become a little cheaper to execute than potentially collected taxes and poof... There's no bank for authorities to call to find your money

"I suppose one could argue this is part of the old Ghandi quote- first they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.  Maybe we're now at the 'then they fight you' stage.  

Still, I think the division in community was entirely unnecessary.  I think if it wasn't for the censorship in /r/bitcoin, we would have come through this much faster and much more coherently as a community.  

But I still believe in the future of crypto, and I'm still bullish on both BTC and BCH..."
"Thanks, I will look into this.  My crypto strategy for the next few months is going to include a lot more diversification than previously so I will pay some attention to this.  These days I think being all in on any one single crypto is probably a bad idea.  

One thing maybe you can give me a quick answer to- from a quick google search it seems like NEO is closer to shares in the company, while GAS is almost pegged to fiat?  How exactly does that work / what's the relationship between NEO and GAS?  Or am I getting it wrong?  "
It's Bitcoin Cash not bcash ok???

"Not picking sides here, but 6 years ago, BTC was priced ~$5-$20, meaning the 6900 BTC donation not that huge, and isn't this the project? https://github.com/epochtalk/epochtalk

Once again, not taking sides this seems to be weak evidence against a very real problem."
"There's needs to be a sticky on this sub at the top with all the proof of the censorship in r/bitcoin.

"I'm not a lawyer, but I've been a proprietor, board member, and treasurer of a not-for-profit corporation for over a half decade. I'm not an expert, but I have a pretty good foundation in business practices, donations, and liability to customers and donors.

Theymos was essentially running a business as sole proprietor of one or more websites. He offered his services for free and solicited ""donations"" towards his expressed expenses. Users ""donated"" to his business. These are essentially gifts from one person to another. There is no implied or guaranteed service in exchange for these gifts. There was clearly no formal or informal investment in the business, as there was no means of conferring any stake in his business and he never referred to these ""donations"" as investments.

Because he is the sole proprietor of his business, he can use the businesses funds on anything he wants and say it was used toward fulfilling his promise to develop the business. Money is fungible, so there is no way to say what money was used for what business activities. His promises are also incredibly vague.

Everyone who donated is like a venture capitalist that backed a failed business. Only they did it without any chance of ever getting their investment back. 

He could have taken all the money and hired literally anyone to write a single line of code, paid it all to that person, and closed up shop as a defunct business and it still wouldn't be fraud, because he did use the funds toward improving his business, and it failed. Even if you could prove that was his plan all along, its nearly impossible to prove that you were materially damaged by his failure to deliver, because you have no stake in the business and there was no clear sale of any good or service in exchange for your donation.

This is essentially the problem with any gofundme, indiegogo, or kickstarter project. There is no protection in crowdfunding beyond whatever the intermediary organization is willing to get both parties to agree to provide and is capable of enforcing. In the case of cryptocurrency donations, there is no intermediary. AT leasdt with paypal donations there is a company with a vested interest in maintaining good PR and keeping its customers happy."
He openly admits he was paying 100k a month and said he expected there total to be around $1 million  you can go see his old forum posts on BitcoinTalk.  The only thing really up fro debate is whether he was simply stupid or acting maliciously.
Oh just like how that Nigerian prince that still hasn't paid me out my $3.7 million isn't committing a crime because he didn't say it was a charity...😒
✋ Hold on, time out, take a breath. Some people get so fired up. The start acting crazy and forgetting how to be decent to people with differing opinions, hence the Theymos problem. What good is it to act like that which you are against. This isn't war. Unless it is, then grab your @#$&ing knives not your words and start showing up at people's doors and start sticking them deep into people's throats. If it's not war then calm the @#$& down and be civilized.
"To be fair comparing the most successful company that has never been done before isnt a good reference point.  More often than not software projects are disasters that overrun, we only hear the ones that succeed to market and rarely will share the war stories to get there.

Sounds like yheymos was just naive and got screwed if this is true."

"> 40 Million dollars to develop a shit looking subreddit and a shit looking bitcointalk forum

Comments like this give theymos an excuse to remove discussions on this topic. You can’t take the dollar value of the donations *today* and ask why the forum doesn’t look like $40 million software. At the time the donations were collected it was about $10k.

If theymos had actually sat on the money until now, the explanation for why there isn’t a new fancy forum would be “because I haven’t ever paid anyone to build it”, wouldn’t it?

And if theymos did pay people to develop new forum software, then he would have done so at much lower valuations than the current near all time high, wouldn’t he?"
If Roger started to censor even 0.0001% as much as theymos you would have a point, but he doesn't. 
Is the owner of Slickage possibly Theymos himself?
Or not a single day if he makes a deal.
It was worth $50k at the time. Still worrisome though. 
"don't you think that the way this sub has been behaving is a bit ridiculous though? why is it your job to bash the other sub. its like a propaganda war. all i know is that my btc dropped hugely in value recently and has started to climb. and my transaction fees are getting a lot better. I'm happy with my current investments in crypto. i have been using eth and ltc as actual currency and just sitting on my btc for no reason. 

i agree that that is kind of stupid. what's the point of cuttency if you can't use it. its just that this sub is going about it in the worst possible way. also, why do the people in this movement insist on rebranding btc. you say that disinformation is bad but the worst cases of disinformation ive seen has come from bch ppl who refer to bch as bitcoin or btc. if that's how y'all do things around here then i dont think you have a right to call the other sub disingenuous or misinformation"
When did I say you mentioned BCH?
Never said it didn’t happen
I know bot, I know.
Why are you using today's price for donations made in 2012/2013? Like the guy above said. If you bought a $20 bag of weed on Silk Road in 2012 for 1 BTC, does the vendor now owe you $6980 change??
yes
"That isn’t really the point. There was a time before all this when Theymos was just a head-mod who also happened to own another discussion forum. He was still sometimes a bit controversial due to events just like the forum donation funds, but he wasn’t the big controlling self-appointed censor of Bitcoin discussions. 

Now Roger is a head-mod who also happens to own another discussion forum/news source. He’s got some contraversies of his own in the past, but he’s not censoring discussion. So it’s all fine, right?"

You may be smart, but there are many less informed people that simply believe what is told to them. The biggest Bitcoin sub is controlling the narrative and is controlling public opinion. That's a little fucked up, imho.
Because the dollar amount of the donation was on the order of $10,000. The IRS would consider the dollar worth of the donation, not the return on the donate item.

A few people wrote something misleading and there was a few days of the usual reddit exuberance and that called for 90% of users to leave if they didn't agree with the total censorship policy?

r/btc gets a lot of heat for being an echo chamber in the sense that it's users are consistently discussing the prevalent censorship in many of Bitcoin's largest forums and resource sites. But it begs a series of follow up questions: Why is it that censorship and all of these bans are occurring in the first place? Why is it that an entire mod team underneath Theymos, (the head moderator), condone, support, and freely associate themselves with this type of entity and activity?

There is no clear cut answer to these questions simply because of the convoluted nature of everything. If I could have a small bit of hubris and make a recommendation for you, dig into the subject with focus. This rabbit hole you're enquiring after is extremely deep.

"Funny enough, we're talking about Theymos, but all of a sudden, here comes someone bringing up something completely unrelated in an attempt to make a moral equivalency.

Whataboutism (summarized by John Oliver): An old Soviet propaganda technique that posits that all actions, no matter the context, share a moral equivalency. And since no one is perfect, therefore, all criticism is hypocritical.

Roger Ver OWNS bitcoin.com. He is the CEO of a company offering services and tools for BTC and BCH. There's an extremely large difference between a private website owner and a monopolistic dictator.

Pop quiz: Who registered bitcoin .org? I'll give you a hint, it wasn't Theymos. Follow that chain of thought for all the websites they control, you'll find a similar pattern."
"Hence why in a year or two, all of those $100+ Million ICOs are going to be dead.

"The accounts transferring hands is a logical inevitably in my opinion, but theory is just theory though. 

Whether the anonymous person that Theymos was is now different than the anonymous individual that Theymos is currently, it makes no difference. Their motives and beliefs are hidden behind a carefully cultivated mask just the same"

I haven't seen anything to indicate BCH mining is more centralized than LTC. Granted, I haven't looked into it. Do you have any links? As long no pool is over 50% it shouldn't be a problem.
"By the time any crypto overtakes USD ; tech and hash power will scale easily. Which means anyone who wants to participate will still be able to doit.


In fact tech already moves faster than crypto anyways."
10gbblock every 10 minutes and you need to generate the correct hash for the 10gb block - It’s not possible even for a super computer unless you make the hashing function weaker in which case you have compromised the security. Smaller is always better.
Ah. Well, as long as nobody can perform a 51% attack, miner centralization isn't a huge problem. That's mainly because the barriers to entry are so low that the community can react to over-centralization and reduce it. I can't remember what pool it was a few years ago that got real close to 50% and they voluntarily split off into two pools (granted, after a ton of people started leaving).
Why is 10GB a huge size for a node?
"> By the time any crypto overtakes USD ; tech and hash power will scale easily. Which means anyone who wants to participate will still be able to doit.
> 

I have been in computer science for 10 years and I assure you it isn't possible. It is not just building(copying) 10 gb blocks but also mine them - so basically you need to hash the 10gb block over and over and over again until you find the solution. All of this should happen in around 10 minutes - which is ridiculous (you'd know if you understand algorithmic time and space complexities). So the only way forward is to make the mathematical puzzles easier and this in turn will compromise security. 

And as a sole user of distributed currency, I cannot download and verify the blocks myself because we now have a 10gb block every 10 minutes. 

Increasing block size isn't the solution. We need a solution which can scale exponentially and not linearly. I am so saddened some marketing assholes are promoting this bullshit of a big block chain ideology and people are buying into it. Those people aren't even developers / computer scientists - they don't know shit about this and so do you!

There was a reason why the core team didn't agree to increasing block size. They could have went ahead with it because it is the easiest thing to do but not the right thing to do. Payment channels / lightning networks are the future. But when that happens there will be people who just copy and with some marketing do the same thing like they are doing it with bitcoin (bitcoin cash)"
Default chain cannot handle it. You would need 2gb to 10 fb blocks to scale to the entire world. By having this larger size, you have taken out what makes bitcoin unique - distributed. I’d rather have a coin which is highly expensive and hard to use over a block chain technology with centralized miners. You might as well have a sql database to update transactions and trust that the central party won’t cheat. It isn’t much different from the current fiat currencies and the central banks all around the world.

If I glue a banana and an apple together and then smash your head with it, did I invent a new weapon or did I invent a new fruit?

Satoshi glued a few old tech together to create a new economic and financial solution (I am going to skip the part where Satoshi was inspired by Wei-Dai's b-money), Satoshi didn't invent any of the technology used.

I wish I could get factual information rather then ""my coin is better than yours"" from these subs.

The talk by Andres stickied to the other sub does a decent job of explaining the logic behind the argument that the block size shouldn't be increased until the next layer is developed. Though I'm not entirely sure why 1mb is the sticking spot. I'd think you could at least grow another order of magnitude before it becomes a serious issue.

"I'm replying to both your guys' comments. (Paging u/ladle3000 )

First of all, both of you need to read this in its entirety, if you haven't already. [link 1](https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/6rxw7k/informative_btc_vs_bch_articles/dl8v4lp/?utm_content=permalink&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=BitcoinMarkets)

The above link helps explain why Bitcoin became so political in the first place.

Bitcoin Cash is much more than just bigger blocks. One of the most important things it does is it changes the leadership (see link 1). Secondly, it avoids segwit (more on that in link 3). And thirdly, it restores Bitcoin to being about making it a form of _money_, rather than a settlement layer. Bitcoin is about liberty, delivered via economics, and executed through technology; in that order. The current path for the old Bitcoin chain completely misses this, and has been completely altered off course. Bitcoin Cash keeps this alive though. And in this spirit, Gavin Andresen, the man whom Satoshi himself handed the Bitcoin project too when he left, said a few days ago that Bitcoin Cash is (basically) the real Bitcoin. [link 2](https://bitsonline.com/gavin-andresen-endorses-bitcoin-cash/).

I addressed the issues with Segwit, and additionally, the concerns about mining centralization, in another comment I wrote earlier. [link 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7cbvel/can_someone_educate_me/dpopizn/)

Regarding your concern that Bitcoin Cash may end up just having the same problems again in the future, you need to understand something: The problem with Bitcoin is not in a lack of unity, it's in the _governance model_. I can not possibly recommend this PDF enough, explaining how Bitcoin Cash can not only not have those problems, but can _thrive_. [link 4](https://bitcoincash.org/letter-from-the-ceo.pdf)

The concern that bigger blocks are not a long-term solution is a valid concern, one which I have thought about a lot myself. There are a lot of things you have to understand. I addressed some of those things in a comment I left here. [link 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7cfwjh/ex_core_supporter_here/dppwib2/?context=3)

Hope this answers some questions.

Edit: Things like the Lightning Network and other applications will work much better with larger blocks. 1 megabyte is extremely, woefully small. There is no good argument for keeping blocks limited to such a size. The only one given so far is that 'everyone needs to be able to run their own node' in order for the network to be decentralized, but this statement comes apart for many reasons, and was never the intended long-term configuration. Satoshi wrote about it.

> ""The current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale. That would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server. The design supports letting users just be users. The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be. Those few nodes will be big server farms. The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don't generate."""
"Yes. Blockstream business model depends on it. No other arguments which can satisfy game theory

> How likely is it that continuing ASICBoost is the primary motivation for Wu and others to support BCH?

Very likely (yes, game theory again). Keeping chain crippled is pushing economic activity everywhere else fiat included, thus, destroying all investments made in mining. Why they or even we 'd support it? Miners are our guardians, not slaves

'Centralization' is a false argument used by Blockstream Core to confuse newbies.

Anything that costs money to make or use will be centralized, because money is not evenly distributed. No matter how you shuffle things around, if it costs money, then in the end the rich will get richer and they can buy more and use more of it, creating centralization.

Blockstream Core wants to keep blocks at 1MB so they're selling the bullshit idea that everyone's Raspberry Pi should be able to run full nodes, and that miners should give power back to the users.

That sounds great to newbies, until you realize that means in the future, anyone running a large botnet, or any group of billionaires can work together and pay Amazon $100million a month to run 500million full nodes and take over a trillion dollar system (centralization).

Full nodes in Bitcoin is just a unique ip and port pair, you can run 50000 full nodes on the same server, using the same disk, simply by redirecting all 50000 ip:port into the same Bitcoin server process, that is, you run one server, but pretend you have 50000 full nodes by opening 50000 ports for it.

If you have capital, you can also buy a few blocks of IP and run a huge full nodes farm, you can redirect all the ip and all the ports into the same machine, run millions of ""full nodes"" using a dozens of servers (centralization), there's no way to tell the difference because every full nodes are supposed to look exactly the same, except the ip and port.

Blockstream Core also complain about Bitmain dominating the ASIC chip processing, claiming it is centralization, but if we use desktop CPU or GPU, they're also centralized by Intel/AMD/Nvidia, they're also also full of patents. Chip manufacturing is also dominated by a few companies such as ASML, when Intel say they will be making 7nm chips, they're actually using patented technology from ASML

In the end almost everything down the chain is centralized, but Blockstream Core doesn't want you to know that. They want you to focus on attacking people that help made Bitcoin Bitcoin. From Satoshi, the Bitcoin whitepaper, to the miners, Blockstream Core spent huge resources attacking them.

Blockstream Core wants power for themselves, Bitcoin was designed to remove human from the decision making process and only listen to hash power, so Blockstream Core kept attacking miners using straw man arguments, such as saying miners have too much power.

But what it comes down to is miners don't actually have power just by being miners, they have power by calculating the Bitcoin math. The math that made Bitcoin Bitcoin.

If you attack the miners, and take power away from miners, all you're doing is take security away from Bitcoin, because you're taking power away from the Bitcoin math process itself. It's this math that had protected Bitcoin from attacks for 8 years.

Blockstream Core have been trying to discredit and change Satoshi's Bitcoin whitepapers for years, because the way Bitcoin was designed to work, takes power away from the banks.

Blockstream Core is a rogue organization dedicated to make Bitcoin useless.

It's probably easier for them to accept litecoin. Since they probably heard of it and has been around longer, and has proven it's self. Also the merchant can assume that not because of fees, I can send a 0 conf coffee transaction on BTC network for 20 cents fine, but it's because it's so valuable people don't want to spend it which alot of my friends are like. And if value had anything to do with merchant adoption Bitcoin wouldn't be where it's at today.
"The more down votes the better. By the way, what is a Bcash promoted post doing in a BTC subreddit?
Spam much?"
No, I don't agree. Your thesis is based upon continuously increasing the block size. The higher block size the more bandwidth and resources are required to process the data. The blocksize was set to 1mb on purpose as proposed by Satoshi. The original blocksize proposal was however higher.
"Well, its just a logical truth. Bubbles cause value to go up.

BCH wont have such a bubble to back it. So we will see a value that is much more stable and probably much lower than BTC is."
That was what I was thinking too, we need to help coinmap update the list, and convince merchants presently on coinmap to get on board Bitcoin Cash.

"It’s a possibility, but I don’t think any short term price fluctuations undermine the long term value proposition of Bitcoin as a concept.

"> Remember to include that Bitcoin Cash is not de-centralized 

 You fail to define decentralised.  

> and that fees will increase over time.

This is true, as people move to Bitcoin Cash the fees may increase, however this will be mitigated by the fact that supply of block space will only limited by the economics of mining.

In fact it will be decades before the lack of a block subsidy even becomes an issue, as the dollar valuation of Bitcoin Cash continues to rise mitigating reward halvings.

As the number of transactions per block increases, then the fee per transaction can still continue to remain small, and the total amount of fees can in time replace the subsidy.

It’s all very simple when you think about it.

I just find it very surprising that you read all about core for years and supported them yet knew nothing of what they're achieved after Satoshi
Men who defy twisted authority. Perfect for the real Bitcoin. Stick to your obedient corporate nerds. Good little boy. 
zzzzz  zzzzzzz
Yah hopefully that rabbit trail doesn’t lead anywhere but I wouldn’t be surprised if it did. Thanks for the gold !
Maybe you can go back to where you belong.
"opposition to Core's roadmap is censored, if you are a developer on the team you will get axed. Jeff G wound up being responsible for implementing Segwit he was an opponent. 

Not to mention the second or 3rd scaling conference made it off topic to discuss scaling by any means involving a hard for or a block size increase, The code of conduct issued to every attendee made it clear that people discussing hard forks would be removed by security. The core organisers even issued shirts that said ACT implying in geek ""i agree"" 

that's censorship at the max. 

the reasons to oppose Segwit are easy to understand you just need to do some independent analysts. 

No point in me convincing you, miners have already been tricked into activating it, if it's a good idea it'll flourish in the market. 

The Bitcoin Cash fork is a fork to avoid Segwit. $21,582,003,236.00 think its a shit idea at this time. "

This isn't about technicals. Look at every other alt, technically we already know it is possible to have larger blocks and it isnt going to crash bitcoin. This is about economics.

Agree,right now the biggest selling point is that BTC has the least friction on the Fiat exchange. Finex, bittrex and kraken already support USD/ETH trading pairs,  suspect USD/BCH are coming...
"I can attest to this. Certainly in the uk you had to jump through various hoops to get your GBP into exchange tradable dollars, only then could you buy in exchange. That kind of process required the most belligerent of believers! And that risk.... (it was almost easier and less risky when you had to PayPal gift total strangers on bitcoinmarket)

Not to mention the whole idea of holding a $100 at 20,000% increase is ridiculous. 

If it doubles (200%) the rational thing to do is rebalance (or at least lock in some profit) which of course hurts future returns. 

So only if you are batshit insane can you actually hold it all the way.  In actual fact I suspect the most ardent supporter is still looking at max $50k at this point (from $100 in 2011)

Someone buying for $50 today would recieve 0.00714 btc and the price would have to rise to $2,8 million which is possible, not in 5 years but maybe 50 years.

That right there is why SegWit is foundering, *developers don't want to deal with it*. And why would they, it provides no real benefit to them over just using a chain that is scaled on-chain and already works with their infrastructure.
"Regarding SegWit:

""This will be a major and complex update to some of the most sensitive parts of our codebase, across a wide variety of platforms and devices, affecting billions in user transactions with potentially significant privacy implications. We will do this cautiously but also with ....""

Welcome to the internet?
Bitcoin isn't electronic cash anymore, didn't you get the memo? The wizard can be put back to good use with Bitcoin Cash which is.
Bitcoin cash.  They hate bitcoin here. And yes, they seem to like it as confusing as possible for noobs.
Both.  They are intrinsically intertwined.  The /r/Bitcoin spiel about it being an altcoin is false.  It is a fork, and if CoreCoin doesn't pull their heads out of their asses and do something about the high fees and unreliable confirmations, it'll become Bitcoin through and through.
b-cash doesn't exist

"Moderating off-topic or dishonest pump & dumps != censorship

Guidelines:

* News articles that do not contain the word ""Bitcoin"" are usually off-topic. This subreddit is not about general financial news.
* Submissions that are mostly about some other cryptocurrency belong elsewhere. For example, /r/CryptoCurrency is a good place to discuss all cryptocurrencies.
* Promotion of client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol **without overwhelming consensus is not permitted.**

Mods gonna mod.

Bitcoin Cash does not have overwhelming consensus. It's a shitty attempt of a hardfork takeover.

Edit: I need to clarify that I'm all **for** bigger blocks, heck make em 32MB! or bigger! but there needs to be a a) clear path to upgrade/fork b) a good voting/signalling time (like segwit) and c) overwhelming concensus by exchanges *and* users that this is the way forward. Bitcoin Cash lacks all this, it was rushed, felt rushed and feels wrong.

No, I'm not. Thanks for letting me know.
"Huh. I was sure you were trolling. I apologize.

I guess you're right that a thing can't be insulted. But people who care about a thing can be indirectly insulted as happened in this case. Posting in /r/btc that bitcoin cash is shitty is not going to win you a lot of friends.

Anyway, I'm sorry that I mistook your intentions. /u/tippr 0.001 bch"
"Well if you feel offended I would like to apologise for that, but it's still my opinion. If someone would say ""Bitcoin sux! boooooo"" I would never feel offended though. 

I'm not trolling. I clearly explained why I think it was a botched attempt to scale Bitcoin. The metrics are clear to me, it's not sold as Bitcoin on the markets, priced as such or has the community behind it. 

How I see it, Bitcoin is still not scaled (boo) and now we have an altcoin that claims to be something it's not. There are better alternatives in that case (LTC or even Doge (lol doge) for speed, etc.)).

>It's a direct insult to BCH

This I find strange though. How can a ""thing"" be insulted?

Likewise, if you paint a picture I'm free to call it pretty or ugly, right? I'm not judging you as a person, just the painting. Constructive criticism. But maybe I should have used the word ""failed, low quality"" instead of ""shitty"".

I long for the day Bitcoin's blocksize increases with the entire (95%?) community behind it. Right now we're falling apart.

Starting to look like a psyop Divide and conquer, but that's a discussion on a whole new level.
"
The blocks in the article are voting for the NYA, that's segwit2x bud. 30% was the percent of miners voting for segwit activation without blocksize increase. Can't find a source now, on phone at work, shouldn't be a hard Google search. 
"The great thing about /r/btc is you're free to call our coin of choice shitty all day long and you won't be banned and your posts won't be removed.

The bad thing about /r/btc (well, one of them) is we get trolled continually.

If you have critiques of BCH you're welcome to air them in the spirit of intellectual inquiry and if you have anything novel to say you might very well start a conversation.

But if all you have is the same old same old you'll probably be ignored and if what you actually do is just say it's ""shitty"" how are we even supposed to know what your views really are? Why should anyone waste their time on that?

That's just an insult. It's a direct insult to BCH and indirectly it's an insult to everyone who cares about and supports BCH, which is the vast majority of the active participants of this sub."
"https://twitter.com/BashCo_/status/930536219087462400

Have a look at the comments"
"a) clear path: Yes, it was announced almost a year, and there was little resistance to segwit being activated. I remember clearly that Litecoin was first and it went very smooth.

b) signalling/voting. There was an 80%-ish level of nodes running segwit enabled full nodes. In july 80% of the miners signalled segwit (not to be confused with segwit2x). (https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/segwit-reaches-80-of-the-hashrate-likely-to-soon-activate/)

c) the exchanges did not create second tickers like BitcoinSW or something, als I didn't see much users (except from hardcore Cash supporters) complaining. 

Segwit - BIP91/BIP148  - was a softfork by the way.

So back to your question:

>So should we disable/remove segwit in your opinion? 

No, this means rolling back months of blocks, this requires a hardfork to undo.

>Only 30% wanted just segwit,

where did you get that number? But t doesn't matter, it's a softfork, you can ignore the data and be fine.
"
"That's not an insult, that's just my opinion on how shitty it was done. Bad coding (EDA) requiring another 2nd HF, no consensus by miners (20% at best), no concensus on markets (BCH ticker was created), hostility towards users, chosing to fork even though it was clear it would not take the ""BTC"" ticker but become an airdropped altcoin.

An insult would be calling you anything, I'm not doing that. Or are you personally offended if I give my opinion about an open source project?"
"Oh come on - check out this thread for example, where OP even came out later on saying that he was hacked: https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7cp4v0/buy_bitcoin_cash_right_now_youre_gonna_regret_it/

Its only baseless if its the side you don't like. Guess what, high monetary rewards attract manipulation on both sides. 

Whats so unrealistic about fake accounts and bots?  Both subreddits have gone to shit and the only thing resembling discussion can be found on bitcoinmarkets (although still a tad core-leaning)."
"I would say that it’s a Moderators job to come out & bring light to this?

I was targeted days before bashco & I made a post about it too. I don’t see which narrative I would be constructing except an anti manipulation one."
Mine such block then
"So should we disable/remove segwit in your opinion? Only 30% wanted just segwit, it obviously wasn't overwhelming consensus.

Edit: phone spelling"
"People are watching this shitstorm like Game of Thrones. I'd not be surprised if 250 or even 1k of biased towards each camp people are constantly looking at new topics only, to catch the latest news

Fake accounts, bot votings - it all sounds scary, but really baseless. Censorship on the other side is real and multiple datapoints do exist"
"I wouldn't be so sure. Why has BashCo, a *moderator*, so blatantly come out with this? Fits their narrative rather well, isn't it? Especially given their affinity for social engineering.

Plus, there was odd vote manipulation occurring here and in /r/BitcoinCash one or two days ago, which in hindsight almost looks like somebody was making a test run before ""attacking"" BashCo in /r/Bitcoin."
Maybe it's Schadenfreude. Hey I'm not some kind of Oracle or something!
"The miners voted for it, but they didn't go through. The people starting the suggested fork backed out themself.

But that was only B. A and C were also non-existent for 2X.

"
"> gratuitous insult.

where did I insult you?
"
Good idea - though i'd say even a week isn't enough. A month would make it exponentially harder for troll farms
I disagree. No additional barriers needed. Let people flow in at any rate, spreading the word matters more than anything else when we're dealing with network effect
"Not if were talking about bots. Very strange that its always around 250 up or downvotes depending on if the post is pro/against core. Then you have fake posts by accounts with no previous bitcoin history. Regardless of the side you're on, you can't earnestly be telling me that this is acceptable behaviour.

I personally received 250 downvotes in the space of less than 10 minutes. That kind of activity is unheard of, even in much bigger subs (posts are hidden from view way before that). Also, completely unrelated posts I made are being brigaded coincidentally. "
Seeing as anti-core posts get 250 automatic upvotes (on rbitcoin, mind you) it's pretty obvious

Now if you're going to retrace your paths, and replace the old worn-out posters with new ones every so often so they never make the area look untidy, then that's great. Most people don't bother.

Do some of those Bitcoin/WU/Bitcoin Cash comparison posters, that'd be hilarious if they record tearing it down.

Printing costs is a complicated formula.  At the very high end, you can pay as much as 50 cents per page at a Fedex Kinkos.  Please don't pay these rates.  At the low end, if you invest a 100$ into a cost effective per page office printer and buy off brand ink, you can get the costs down to ~1-2 cents a page.

The other major variable cost, surprisingly, is the clear box tape used to put up the posters.  a 50 yard roll of tape cost `4-8 dollars and can put up 30-40 posters.  

If you get a staple gun (~20$), staples are basically free.  But things can only be stapled in so many places.

And, of course, the biggest variable cost by far, is your time spent putting up the posters.  (I myself would just be playing videos games, or posting on reddit anyway though....).  

I'd also recommend having some sort of quick, by foot, mode of transportation.  I already have a scooter, so I am able to zip around the city very quickly.  Also, finding a good density of highly trafficed locations is important."

How so?
It will far surpass it.
"Unrelated but I love the fact that we have the word “cash” in the name. I feel it makes it easier for non techies to follow. 

I feel that way we don’t have to compete to be recognized as a payment method. 
 
Bitcoin needs to permeate public consciousness further to set itself as a means of paying for stuff. My dad may have Bitcoin and may see “bitcoin accepted here” but never use it cause he doesn’t make that connection. 

But if he sees “Bitcoin Cash” it might be easier since it’s cash and he’s been paying for stuff his entire life w it.

I am just a random guy living in San Francisco.  I am not some bitcoin company founder, PR person, or marketing expert.  All I did was slap together a poster, with bad editing skills, using copy pasted logos, made by other people.  And then I printed them out and posted them around the city.

You too can do any of this any more!  Just go DO something, and then if it fails, well you'll learn from your mistakes, iterate, and do it better next time.  

I've certainly learned a whole lot of what goes into posting flyers around the city, along the way of doing it.  

But most importantly, whatever it is you do, document it and let other people in the community know what you did.  Whether it be by taking a photo and posting it here on this subreddit, or any other channel.  

That way you can get feedback, and inspire others to do things as well.  "

Alternative facts
"~25% in crypto worlds is still ""a couple of percent"" :)"
">BCH has no real long term value unless it manages to build a real community of users.

Agreed. It's also very important is that many BCH accepting businesses come aboard.

>The natural trend of BCH is to head to zero as people get access to it and unload it for BTC.

I did the opposite. It remains to be seen how others react, but I'm fairly  confident of my position right now. Much like I was for BTC from 2013 to exit about a week ago (+9400%) or XMR from 2014 to current date (+23900%), percentages against USD.

Most important for me would be to get rid of using legacy banking. I want to do business directly in cryptocurrencies, but sadly BTC is now pretty much useless for that (due to high fees). Maybe it will be better in the future, with LN and other second layer solutions, but that's uncertain.
"
">BCH has no real long term value unless it manages to build a real community of users. 

Oh the irony. Here you are talking about how BCH will fail if it can't have a broad community meanwhile BTC is on a path to rapidly becoming a coin only transactable by millionaires.

I'm sorry for your upcoming losses. I recommend keeping your BTC in an exchange or you might lose it all forever
So you want your ponzi scheme to go up in value, and it doesn't concern you that it has no actual use and if enough people realize this it won't have nay worth while a funciton coin like bitcoinc would still have value due to it's ability to be used and wouldn't potentially collapse?
OK but that doesn't explain why it is done in such a lame way.
The Korean exchange volumes have often been ludicrous - I've seen them have higher 24-hour volume than the entire economic output of South Korea over that period, likely because some traders have zero percent fees on there and so have no disincentive from carrying out pointless/wash trades.
Bithumb is now a Chinese exchange as well basically since they can no longer trade in China, hence the insane volumes we saw over the weekend that literally melted down their trade engine.
Yes, the BCH-KRW pair on Bitthumb was the largest trading pair and [still is](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin-cash/#markets).
No, but r/bitcoin, bitcointalk and bitcoin.org are the three main sources of information for people wanting to learn about bitcoin. There are all moderated and heavily censored by the same people. How is that not a fucked up echo chamber?

Not being able to easily transact onchain is the literal definition of ""your money rotting.""

That may look like a wallet with only lunch money in it to you, but in reality it was the life savings of some poor bastard in Peru that got frozen for all time on the BTC chain. Value, just vanishing into thin air.  Poof! A wealth transfer to everyone with bigger wallets.

"Actually those open mod logs on /r/btc don't prove anything. While it might be a nice move towards transparency but it's not an open mod log feature through Reddit (I don't think Reddit has this) instead it's hosted through a third party and they just themed the web page to look like this subreddit, so if they wanted to they could easily modify leave out and manipulate those moderator logs.


That said I go against the tieds in this sub and I haven't been banned yet only downvoted, meanwhile for calling people out on their shit I've been banned for 4 months on /r/Bitcoin. "

"I am conflicted because I firmly believe in BTC as the one true and only Bitcoin, which goes against the general rhetoric of this sub, but /r/bitcoin has become a terrible shithole of censorship.
Bitcoin Cash is not Bitcoin and never will be, but moderator of this sub Roger Ver will keep pushing that story until BCH's death.

So my choice is:  Go to the subreddit which supports the general philosophy that I agree with in terms of the currency, but is censored and filters out much of the good opposing opinions, versus the subreddit which is pushing an entirely different philosophy than me and would probably brand me the enemy and part of the problem, but at least the censorship isn't as bad here.

Self-interested greedy assholes ruin everything.  "
"My conspiracy theory is that it was a way for some people to lock branding of ""Bitcoin Gold"" away from Core in the event that **by some miracle** everyone collectively said Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin. Because in the end, Bitcoin Cash wants to be a store of value too.

Anyways Bitcoin is Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin Cash. I dunno what value Bitcoin Gold will have, but then again, I can say that about another 990 altcoins."

"He's talking about the predicted concerted effort of miners and other whales to keep mining BTC to maintain the current difficulty level through the next adjustment point (at the same time preventing BCH difficulty from going up too much), while propping up the BCH at 1200ish and boosting BTC value with trade walls.  

This is in order to steadily convert their large amounts of BTC to BCH while minimizing slippage.  The BTC death spiral comes after these guys finish their conversion and move over their mining power for goodd to the BCH chain. "
Damn, guess I'm just gonna kys now.
It has to build up like before the last EDA kicked in. In the meantime jointed Bitcoin at ATH!
"Exactly.  Indeed, I'd say it's the sum total of *every* fork.  Sure, I think Bitcoin Gold stinks to high heaven (some good ideas, but a dev team of scammers), but there are still people out there who will buy it off you for a hundred-odd bucks.  So even that shitty fork's meagre price gets added to the total.

But yeah, the dominant fork is for the market to decide, not a secretive clique of devs and their stringpullers.  Bitcoin is *open software*, after all, and so we are all free to choose whichever form of it we like."

Well I kinda doubt there's going to be much surprise. Segwit will not get huge adoption and the mempool will regularly be congested. Users will move towards more 3rd-party/off-chain transactions or abandon Bitcoin altogether. This way the mempool congestion will never be incredible, but will not show all the transactions Bitcoin actually misses

"I heard it said in another thread, that some people here keep buying a lot when BCH closes in on 1200. It's possible - I don't say it *is* so - that the support is just coming from hard core BCH supporters.

It may or may not be sustainable. But a support level is there only as someone wants to support it :)

The structure is indeed similar.  Bitcoin still has a relatively high inflation rate and, thanks to Blockstream/Core, is gaining the same artificial barriers to entry as the FED.

I find it hard to believe that anyone working professionally with bitcoin hasn't heard of alternative cryptos.
It's incredibly tedious. These people have absolutely no understanding of how the world works.
"If by the ""world"" you mean the bitcoin equivalent of retail investors paying $19.95 a trade on Schwab, then yes.  But retail investor panic is a capitulation and signals a bottom which is *exactly what happened over the weekend*.  See also October 2008.  All that red is the dumb money cashing out.  And they were selling to investors. Just like this weekend.

Most of what you are writing is confused nonsense.  Bitcoin was not created to replace V or MC.  It was created to replace (or coexist along side with) currency as a store of value. A digital gold.  

Second, Bitcoin was not intended to replace VISA or MC be
cause those work perfectly well.   The retail segment of the S&P500 is not claiming that they are broken.  Bitcoin as a payment mechanism (i.e. the blockchain and exchanges) was created to address payments in those economic and financial circumstances where V and MC aren't available or don't work, i.e. the black markets, movement of capital across borders  where national laws restrict or outright ban it, a store of value when banks and the financial system are unreliable (e.g. Cyprus a few years ago).

So yes, the retail investors couldn't get their confirmations right away.  So?  In 1987 when the stock market crashed in the US, not only were confirmations hopelessly delayed, but the actual tape was delayed by several hours, meaning there wasn't accurate price information for anyone until well into the night after the market closed.

The world didn't end.  No one thought that a late tape mean that the US stock market was a rigged sham.  Everything was fine.

The same thing will happen here.  If you plan to hold BTC for a long time, then the confirmation time really doesn't matter.  If you want to day trade, then yes it matters.  But the primary purposed of BTC isn't to allow daytraders to gamble just like the stock market isn't either.  You *can* use it for that, but don't complain when it doesn't re-engineer itself to suit your needs.

And no, I'm not a trader.  I'm not that stupid.  I don't bet on penny stocks, don't gamble on options or futures, and don't try to time the market.  

It was the traders who got burned this weekend.  The investors did not.  From the perspective of investors, the events of the last few days will literally disappear as hourly charts get averaged into daily charts, then weekly, and then monthly ones."
"You guys just keep repeating yourselves. There is still only hot air as reasoning, the whole sub did the same during the first time.

BCC is falling again after the initial pump, no interest from miners. Fuck logic, tho, something something laser guided missile and death spirals."

See just where this ""laser guided missile"" landed."
"I don't disagree with your point, but Wall St aren't the ones issuing USDT. 

"
But, you see, Wall St has no stake in this game whatsoever. They can continue with their activity perfectly in a world under bitcoin.
"And in theory there is no reason for this scheme to ever fail until the banking system collapses because they can't match the prices of crypto anymore.
"
This is what miners are doing. Despite BCH atm more profitable to mine, BTC still has considerable hash power - miners are voluntarily doing this until november 25 then RIP
But when they stop BCH overtakes BTC and shoots up. Win-win.
They need some room to breath I guess. If BCH ever reaches price parity with BTC, BTC dies and because a lot of people know this risk the panic will start before price parity is achieved so they need more space to avoid panic.
I'm fine with that :)
Bitcoin is up~25% over the last month. 
"> Bitcoin Segwit is unusable at scale

This is true today, but L2 solutions are in development. If you're skeptical that BTC will _ever_ be able to scale, then I can see why you would choose to hold BCH instead."
"> Bitcoin Segwit is unusable at scale

Bitcoin Cash has a mining centralization problem right now that needs to be addressed. You can't hoard mining power and expect the community to want to ""invest"" in a system that is rigged against them. We already have the USD if we want to do that!

Ultimately, it's about spreading the wealth around the best way you can. BTC has Alts. If BCH thinks it can go it alone, then you won't get any one who wants to invest in the ecosystem.

BCH is a weapon right now. If BTC survives the attack, then it absolutely deserves to be king. But again, BCH is only thinking about itself and not the broader ecosystem!"
Who cares about confirmation times? It is the slowest, safest, most immutable and censorship-resistant crypto out there. People buy it because it is a safe, profitable and stable store of value. It just keeps on keepin. If you want speed, just move some fractions of a BTC over to Litecoin/ETH/BCH or whatever. People don't use it for spending, that would be stupid since it keeps appreciating in value. You don't invest in a currency. You do invest in appreciating assets. If you want a true crypro CURRENCY it should not appreciate in value since exchanging it for coffee would be stupid. Therefore, USDT, or any other crypto that doesn't grow like Bitcoin would be much more suitable for payments.
You're saying that BTC and BCH are not identical, which is true. However they're both continuations of the original chain.
"By now ""Bitcoin"" and ""BTC"" is equivalent with BT1, (almost) nobody is arguing against that.  I'd be really dishonest if I would be selling ""bitcoin"" to someone and shipping BCH.  That's not what is implied with the  ""Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin""-slogan.

I believe the intention with the ""Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin""-slogan is:

* Bitcoin Cash is following the spirit of the Satoshi whitepaper, while BT1 doesn't.
* Bitcoin Cash is not just yet another alt-coin, it is the focal point for anyone loving Bitcoin and wanting to use it as a means of payment and a currency.

Most of the BCH-lovers have hopes that BCH at some point will overtake BT1 both in accumulated hash power, market price and adoption, and at that point we can start serious discussions on redefining the BTC/XBT-ticker and claiming the ""BItcoin"" trademark."
"Everyone has an agenda, mind you. Most of the bitcoin social media (bitcoin.org, bitcointalk, r/bitcoin) actively moderate or block discussion of Bitcoin Cash as an 'altcoin', which isn't much different then saying ""bitcoin core/segwit is bitcoin""

I don't really approve, it's a bad marketing method by bitcoin.com, but it's hardly the first time propoganda is used to politicize bitcoin"
Gold is a shitty ripoff of Zcash created by amateurs. It has absolutely nothing to do with Bitcoin aside bastardizing the brand to scam people.
"My conspiracy theory is that it was a way for some people to test to see whether a Bitcoin POW change would gain traction in the community. After all, a POW change is the only way to ""fire"" current Bitcoin miners."

Never seen anyone there deny that it was AXA.
Lol, try asking why Jihan only takes BCH for ASICS, try asking why most volume of BCH is from a Korean no fee exchange, try asking why there are paid downvote bots proved on the other sub, what a joke.   But keep going with your core boogey man, even though they're a wide range of like[ 60 independent devs](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/graphs/contributors).  Talk about brainwashing. 
"Store of value. Brand awareness.

USD is WAY better at moving ""stable"" money around than BCH. So BCH isn't competing with Bitcoin. It's competing with the dollar. I'll trade transaction time in BTC for better store of value.

Not saying that won't change, but BCH hasn't come out with an L2 strategy yet. And having mining centralized around Bitmain is a terrible idea.

Ask everyone who ""pre-ordered"" dash miners or litecoin miners. The latest batch of Dash miners FINALLY arrived (ordered 3 months ago). In that time, Bitmain gave all the Chinese miners the machines first and pushed the difficulty up giving them a huge advantage.

Mining is a completely rigged game at this point and will kill BCH. There is a reason everyone has moved to Equihash GPU mining. It's a safer strategy to support the BTC ecosystem.

This is about sustaining the Bitcoin ecosystem. NOT burning the king because you don't like a delayed L2 execution. If you VALUE store of value, MARKET CAP is king. Sorry, but that's just how it works. 
 
Edit: That said, I believe in free market and competition. If Bitcoin Cash can prove to me that it's a better king, then I'll bend the knee. I don't see that yet.

"The people developing Bitcoin get it.

Any cryptocurrency that wants to be like Bitcoin must go through everything that Bitcoin has gone through.

I want to save my money in a way that doesn't rot, doesn't rely on government laws, isn't inflated, etc. So I save with Bitcoin.

Use the coins for what they are best at. I want a hoard of liquid money in the future, so I save Bitcoin. Notice that transaction times and fees are not part of my current worries. Same with Bitcoin. A system is being created to withstand all the businesses and governments in the world. Fees and transaction times are a secondary concern."
"Yea, BCH was protected from it for a while due to being less popular.  It's up to us spread the word so that regular users dont put their money on exchanges that use tether (on for any length of time on exchanges, tbh). 

This is the flip side of currency without govt oversight.  "
"Please give a proper rebuttal. It’s important to have an open discussion about the approaches of both chains so that everyone can vote based on an informed decision.

To me Bitcoin is the sum total of every significant fork. Bitcoin=BCH+BTC. Honey Badger simply made a backup copy of himself just in case one of him dies. Both of him are doing experimental stuff because hey, why not? He can test both sides of a hypothesis without fear of death. This is Honey Badger's true superpower.
"I can see how people would think that, but most here haven't gone fully into BCH. In fact, until the recent surge it only took 5% of your BTC holdings to double your BCH holdings, so there isn't much need for radical moves away from BTC except if you want to amp up the risk/reward profile on what is already one of the world's highest-riskiest/highest-reward investments. 

I just look at BCH+BTC and see an all time high. Excellent! Forking is good for a coin, not bad."
"I don't feel like commenting on this further.

/u/yourliestopshere already did enough shilling and pushing of BCH for one lifetime.

I'm out far and fast. Enjoy the pump and dump my dudes.

Edit: Fine, minor comment: I dont do small transactions, I do large transactions. That's why I like BTC and I'm happy with how it is. If BCH wants to be a replacement for day to day cash, so be it. It can live in tandem with BTC I believe. But all these BCH users telling me ""NO YOU'RE WRONG SELL YOUR BTC AND GET BCH NOW"" is making me rather ... Worried WHY there's so many users crawling out of the woodwork pushing so hard for that instead of just letting BTC users live and let live.

"I mean I used an exchange to turn my BCH into BTC and then successfully pulled it out of that exchange and into my personal wallet at the time of doing those trades.

"Pretty sure Bitcoin is Bitcoin.

If your shitcoin was good enough on its own you wouldn't need to hijack the bitcoin name.
If fees continue to go up it will take a bigger and bigger part of your savings to move them, and you will eventually have to do it. Imagine having 1 BTC as savings and having to pay 0.1 BTC as fee.

"> a 50 sat/byte transaction hasn't been included in a block for over 4 days now

You sure that's accurate? There are many 50 sat/byte transactions in the pool waiting, yes, but that layer has been chipped away at a few times in the last few days, looking at [the Jochen Hoenicke charts](https://imgur.com/v5NxjdQ). There's a few stair-steps down in the 50 sat/byte layer. Now, those could be transactions that were replaced-by-fee to be a higher level, but odds are a few of them were actually included in a block, no? Any block explorers display blocks overall with the fees paid for each transaction in it?"
"I think from reading the chart there were some included.

The point however is, bank transfer is not permissionless and censorship resistant and that has the cost of POW."

Not everything is black and white. Gold is gold. BTC is a virtual number that matches your definition - it worths as much as another fool is ready to pay for it. Gold isn't comparable with BTC, but perhaps western union would be more suitable for comparison."
so in your view the only reason to make a Bitcoin transaction will be to put away money you never plan to touch so that it will go up in value and other coins will be used for transacting like P2P cash?
As I said if you pick the proper range you will get whatever results you want. I could argue that BCH didn't increase more because of the 2x agreement which made some big blockers stay on BTC positions instead of switch to BCH back then.

"This means: I don't think it's a good idea to buy into BCH because of its perceived ""war against bitcoin"" and think you will earn money. You might risk to lose - even if you think you have won. I.e. if you ""win"", but could have bought BTC and won even more, you have still lost money.

Now, I realize not everything is money, that someone believes in things so much they are willing to lose money. They just have to realize that the ""BCH will win mantra"" is imho even higher risk than buying into BTC today, so seen from a financial perspective, you have to calculate on losing money."

">That’s just redditors expressing their opinion of core and their broken technology roadmap. 

I would be inclined to agree if there wasn't massive vote manipulation going on across both subs pushing the BCH narrative. So while post aren't being deleted they are being hidden from view by hacked/bought accounts. This is much worse in my opinion as it's being sold as ""the community speaking"" when it's someone with money pushing their own agenda by shitty/illegal methods.

That’s just redditors expressing their opinion of core and their broken technology roadmap. Downvoting something is not deletion, which is what we see happening wholesale on r/bitcoin. Also you won’t get banned from r/btc whereas hundreds of people have been banned from r/bitcoin (me included). I am no shill. I just asked some questions and expressed an opinion. My comments and posts were deleted and I was banned. That is censorship. 
"Regardless, BCH perform much better than this and always will. 

Try to do that with BTC. /u/tippr $0.25

The old network just refused to update soon to become obsolete. What good is a network run by a decade old hardware?  "
I see, I assumed his comment was just a cheap swipe at BCH being a similar kind of lame scam as BTG, which of course is ludicrous.
"Pricing out 99%? What? I would assume you're aware you don't have to buy a whole bitcoin. Im not sure what you even mean with that argument. It seems like you basically are for bitcoin cash because its not as ""mainstream"" and BCH is more ""underground"".. cmon this is currency, not a rock band popular among high school kids.

It seems like we have the same end goal for crypto but you have some misunderstandings and that is why you are pro BCH. Just because wall street is putting money into something  doesnt mean they or banks have any control over it. There are going to be profit seekers no matter what BCH or BTC. If the currency is truly decentralized it doesnt matter. They might win, they might lose but in the end its good for the currency they invest in. You want no large groups to be able to control the currency. Well, same here... thats why I don't support a block size increase which will increase the overhead required for mining. Eventually only large (dare i say coorperate) mining pools will be able to mine. With that, those large groups can control the currency and manipulate it whichever way they please. 

How did BCH have a hard fork a few days ago yet the decision to do that was decided by around 3 people? BCH has a CEO ffs. How exactly is this the ""currency nobody can control"" again?

Im starting to see proponents of BCH have their heart in the right place and maybe not all are malicious. You are just being played by a skilled con artist (Ver). While im not worried about BCH in the least as its decline has already begun, id encourage you to do a little more research and then decide which of the currencies is actually decentralized and closer to the currency you are describing."

Gold is only worth what another person is ready to pay for it as well. That's why it's heavily traded just like anything else. Nothing fundamentally ever happened to it to cause it to go up and down in price so much in the last 10 years. It's just worth what the next person is willing to pay. It doesn't have many more uses now than it did 10 years ago, yet the price fluctuates a lot."

I call you that because you're acting like one. Just go ""lol well enjoy your shitcoin while I ride the moon on BCH"" like a human being would, stop acting like a robot advertising BCH. 


"
"Yep, that's exactly what I have in mind, which is why my BTC personal holdings are only going to go up to ""One full BTC"" and not past anytime soon. It's a gamble; That single coin may turn shit or shiny, but I want a full solid *COIN* for the ride.

As I just said to someone else though, it's less about the value and more about memories and history to me at this point, to a large degree, to be honest.

BTC in the future may be a hard gamble, but if I have 1 coin just to look back in 10 years and say ""Man that was wild when it first started"", I'd be happy, even if BTC is valued at $1 a coin. 

Hell, it'd almost be symbolic; I first found out and started using BTC for minor transactions and such years and years ago when it was under $4 a coin.

I have no problem with BCH being the new ""future"", and I never claim BTC is future proof. All I said is I want one full BTC then I'll start diversifying some more again. I'm not the word of God or the masses, I'm just one guy with sometimes shitty decisions doing his own thing."
"What's that mean?

Sorry, bit tired from work and all this discussion, too vague for me right now haha."
I see reading comprehension is not your strong suit. I know EDA was replaced but before everyone was saying how it would kill off BTC eventually... 
I just did it the other day.
"> when banks cost much less/nothing

What does nothing mean if not free?"
"Barely any. I never said it's useful. I said it has value because people want it to. All crypto could be worth $0 in a year if the market decides as such.

I personally think it could be worth a tiny fraction of what it is now. I really have no idea what path it ultimately takes. I'm happy to own it on the way up and have no problem dumping it all on the way down."
I'm being intentionally dense because your argument doesn't make sense
"End of the day though, in my current opinion, I think BCH is good for the P2P day to day stuff and BTC is good for large-transaction/storage.

That is far from a concrete final statement, it is merely my current opinion on the matter.

BCH very likely can take over the ""large transaction / storage"" section I have BTC set for in my head, but right now I don't see it so I don't do it.

When BCH becomes big enough to allow small transactions between a kid mowing a lawn and the old man paying as well as allowing international overseas business deals, then I'll be praising it.

Just... As it stands now, it's just ineffective for what I use it for and, after today, it's becoming a bit concerning how much some BCH users are pushing HARD to convince BTC holders to swap over to BCH. 

Not to say you did or have, but if you read this full comment thread.... Well, at least a few users are acting pretty maliciously towards BTC for reasons that are making me question their motive. 

Some of these people are WAY too concerned with what I do with my money or how I invest for it to feel natural and nonforced... 

Maybe it's just the state of the last few days of drama but some of the comments here today have shook me into being a lot more cautious with regards to BCH than I was 5 days ago. But I dont see people telling BCH holders to sell all their assets for BTC; The few comments of those types tend to be ""Lol well have fun with BCH while I make money off BTC"", which is what I'd expect BCH'ers to say to BTC holders.... Not en-masse saying ""YEAH SELL YOUR BTC FOR BCH NOW"". 

"
I think the ‘brigading’ you are trying to beat up is probably more people like me. There are usually well over 1000 people on this sub so why is it unusual that a bitcoin shitpost get 100 downvotes in a relatively short period of time? The truth is that the posts and comments are still there and you can still see them which is entirely different to what happens on r/bitcoin. If you’re tying to be some kind of apologist for the actions of the r/bitcoin mods by saying we downvote your stuff, you are barking up the wrong tree. 
I haven't been through a long bear market with Bitcoin yet. Just temporary drops. I have been at it since March 2017. So I can't answer for sure, but I do not believe that I have weak hands.
My argument is that you can't claim that the market dislikes big blocks especially based on 24 hours trading.
That's the thing though, BTC's abilities are a mere subset of BCH's. What ever BTC can do, BCH can do better. Want to send $1mil? Both can do it. Want to buy lunch, only BCH is reasonable to use.
Read the post I linked, there is plenty of evidence. To the point that even the Reddit admins are in the thread acknowledging it. I'm in no way defending the censorship in the other sub, I think it is very heavy handed right now and that does not lead to good discussion but neither does vote manipulation or people like you blindly downvoting dissenting opinions.
The last one lasted almost 2 years. It was pretty ugly.
I never made that claim. But you can't make that claim either. And just to be clear, I'm not even taking a side, this whole time I've just been pointing out change in value over different periods. 
"Yeah I'm aware BCH *can* do it but until people accept it it technically *can't* do it, y'know what I mean?

Put it this way:

If enough of my business customers move to accepting BCH that it becomes say... 50%+ of available transactions, my primary holding may swap over to BCH to lessen fees / whatever other benefits BCH offers over BTC.

But until that day... What can I do if no one accepts what I'm selling? I'm not the word of god on if BTC or BCH will ""win"" or be the primary coin in 3+ years, all I know is the business I deal in in the active moment and as such, I have a personal stake in (soon hopefully) one full BTC coin .... Which, equally, might split more over to BCH once business starts seeing more people accepting it. I'm just one guy who acts on strange instincts and feelings sometimes, I don't do everything ""by the book"". Yes, it's a bit of a gamble perhaps, but... Well, this is my personal holdings I'm talking about, not business. "
This is true but I didn't start the argument that prices show that market shows preference for one over the other I was merely replying to such a claim.
Wait, not to be a dick but how do you not have more than one BTC if your business uses it?
"Sorry, realized that last statement was a bit confusing....

The ""Almost one full BTC"" thing is my personal investment ""account"", I have a separate amount and account for business. I just don't feel comfortable talking about the potential valuation/holdings of my business on Reddit, might open me up to some people looking for a hack / dox target?

So, yeah, my goal of 1 BTC is not there yet, it's my ""personal investment"" and is raked in some non-business ideals decisions. ""I like Bitcoin because I've known it"" ""It feels safe"" y'know, not technical decisions.

The business side is more technical, and as such, is more pliable and willing to change to BCH acceptance by others based on customers. Me myself and my personal account? I'd likely still just sit on 1 full Bitcoin permanently and just start buying up some BCH if I want to rather than ever selling my full Bitcoin *for* BCH.

Even if BTC tanks to the ground, having one full coin 10+ years from now will be a piece of history / memories to me, y'know? So having one full coin is more about *that* than the money implications."
"I'll be honest. That sounds retarded. When I invest I don't let emotions take over. I do a shitload of readings before I decide to spend a single cent.

That said, this was a refreshing chat with an opposing party. (Something not possible on rbitcoin, since either you or me would be banned.)

So here's a waterfront condo on me. Don't sweat it.

$5 /u/tippr "
"I mean yeah it's dumb but it's how I currently feel about the situation. Subject to change and all, but after buying and selling BTC since it was $4 a coin I needed to put my foot down and stop guilting myself with the ""What if I DID just toss $200 to BTC and leave it for 5 years?""

So, Hell or high water, I'm getting one coin and going to sit on it and see what happens. If anything, it gives me the peace of mind to not keep regretting past decisions, and in the future it may teach me a hard lesson about making decisions emotionally.

End of the day though, the regret every time the price spiked was killing me. I can't live every successive year going ""Man if only I bought in and sat on it THIS time"", y'know?

Like I said, diversification is something I'm learning and BCH is in my future, but I feel a need for that symbolic one-full coin.

$200 / $4 a coin = 50 coins x $7k USD = $350k USD.

I know about the fallacies and I know the ""What-if's"" on ""Well when would you have sold?"", but.... Damn. ""$200 and sit for 3-5 years"" ran through my mind so many times, but minimum wage living paycheck to paycheck back then... Wasn't an option. Whereas today if I were to buy the rest of my full BTC and it crashes to $1 in the future, it won't kill my life. I've got non-crypto savings and investments now, so the safety blanket is allowing some riskier plays.

Anywho..... How do I use this Tippr bot thing? Like.... Rofl, sounds greedy, but how do I cash it out of Reddit? Never done any tipping for BTC or BCH on here. 

Edit: Last question: Thoughts on the development team with BCH? I haven't done *much* reading into BCH but the small dev pool has me worried whenever I read about it. "

If you don't understand the value of Bitcoin you should go read the white paper.
"> so that it will go up in value 

I do hope it goes up in value, but that would be speculating (which is fine). I am talking about saving. 

As far as how to make it spendable, there are a bunch of different things that can happen other than on-chain transactions. I am excited to see those, including maybe alts for spendability if that's how it goes.

Think about this. If we ever get decentralized instant exchanges, where would you like to keep your value? I would choose Bitcoin."

"Not when very few if any of the people I do business with take it.

Not to mention the difficulty I had in even finding an exchange for BCH when I pulled some of it into BTC the other day.

Maybe when the coin matures enough that the public takes more notice I'll consider it, but as it stands, it is not an option in 90% of my uses.

Edit: And before you suggest it, no I won't tell who I work with what coins to use. Not to say you will, but... I'm not about to tell someone ""Hey take my BCH instead of BTC for this sale"" and potentially lose a sale."
"No thanks, I buy during dips in chunks I like.

Y'know, like when I sold BCH at $1500 and bought the same amount in BTC at $6k.

So, let's see... 0.3 coins at $1500 = $450 USD earned -> turned into BTC @ $6k = 0.075 Coins -> @$7.250k x 0.075 coins = $540, for a profit of $90. 

Now, how's BCH doing lately...? [Oh dear, $1250?](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin-cash/), it went down?

Well, thanks BCH! Slowly building to that single BTC coin at my own timeframe based on milking the most out of the markets. "

It sucks that they are spreading so much misinformation.  I've been using BTC for years and it is no longer the BTC that I remember.  BCH reminds me of the better days.
We are all financially biased but one sub is heavily censored and the other is not. 
The subreddit itself is not pushing anything. This is selection bias. People who support big blocks (note that originally we didn't support Bitcoin Cash we supported blocksize increase) get banned more often from /r/Bitcoin and this is why there are more people here who support BCH than BTC. If big blockers come here no one will ban them, least of all Roger Ver.

I'm sure they're lower and I'm sure that's fantastic, but I'll personally read into it and put my money into it when I'm ready; After I have a full BTC Coin and do research.

But no, it seems every BCH user is pushing HARD to get everyone to swap over to BCH and drop BTC. And that's slightly concerning. I've never seen someone care so much about someone elses' money, y'know?"
"BCH solves the transaction fee/time problem with centralization which is the exact opposite of the moral you're preaching on about. Wallstreet money coming in is simply money coming in and nothing more. Bitcoin is truly decentralized so it is not changing anything other than raising the value. Can you tell me what exactly is your problem with Wallstreet putting money in? Im sure you have a very good reason other than muh ""anti authority"".

Here is how your story goes. BCH EDA will cause BTC to death spiral. BCH will take over BTC after the hardfork due to death spiral. BCH will slowly take over BTC due to whales slowly accumulating.... It never ends. When you are wrong you come up with another reason to justify what is happening in the real world. BCH didn't take over so instead of thinking the market has chosen what is more valuable you think BCH price is being suppressed by whales so they can keep accumulating...??? This is where you completely have lost it. You do not have a subjective view on the matter and are only capable of seeing your world view and will find an reason to convince yourself you are still right no matter the outcome. BCH could go to $1 and you would still come up with something. You are either seriously lost or being paid to shill.

Vitalik wanted to make Ethereum a part of Bitcoin, when he saw how hard it was to work with core, he decided to make his own coin. Imagine bitcoin with all the features of ETH and no transaction backlog, easily $175 Billion with the value of BTC, ETH, and BCH combined.

"You were looking at the 4-day version of that chart? By clicking the 50-60 band, that makes that band the lowest on the chart. Since the lowest one on the chart's lower edge can't go down further, any stair-stepping movement at the top of that band has to be from that band (if lower-levels were show, ripples from lower levels get propagated upward, giving a false-positive).

You can also run your mouse across the chart to get a tooltip of the actual numbers. The ""50+"" number goes from around 22,000 at 8:23am UTC to  a low of 16,300 at 8:36am (times on the chart are your own local time, so you'd need to adjust accordingly. It's the second-from-the-left circle in my screenshot), showing the number of those sort of transactions in the mempool went down by several thousand.

The top edge of that chart hasn't dipped down into the 50 sat/byte band in the last 4 days; is that what you meant? If so, yes, you're misreading what that means. The top-most edge of that chart dipping into a given band's level means that there's no (or very very little) transactions in the mempool that have a higher fee than that level. Whatever the current top-most edge seems to be ""eating away at"" at a given time is about the maximum amount of fee you'd need to pay to get into a block relatively quickly (right now it's the gray-ish 60-80 sat/byte band). But each block can take a variety of transactions from a variety of price bands on that chart, so individual transactions out of lower bands will likely get picked up even when the upper edge is higher. That make sense?"

Just out of interest, how DO you use BTC?
What percentage would dig in to if not yours, then the average trading profits? I'm curious to see how the growing fees affect the types of trading.
3% are you kidding?  You are not using bitcoin, how is a 3% fee a peer to peer cash system?  Its not.  I would consider a substitute good.  You are not using bitcoin, you are using fedcoin.

My problem with the 1mb chain is that its pricing the 99% out of using a peer-to-peer digital currency. 

TBH, I dont care if your bankcoin goes parabolic and becomes the new global bank settlement coin. That’s just not why bitcoin was created. So if anyone shouls stop pretending to be bitcoin it’s the 1mb chain.

The dominant fork will be decided by the *market*, not a secretive clique of manipulative devs and their bankster stringpullers.  No-one owns the Bitcoin brand - it's an *open* project, not a privatised one, and it always has been.  This is the way of the honey badger - deal with it."

It’s like the christian preachers predicting the end of world next week.  The flippening date has to keep moving forward.  The political drama has to end before BCH is taken seriously.
No it doesn't, Gold is an Equihash coin (because it is a Zcash fork), BTC/BCH are SHA246d.

Yup. I'm not one of the people accusing Blockstream of being controlled by lizard people who want to control bitcoin or whatever the favorite conspiracy theory is this week.
"High frequency trading involves not only counterparties, but counter-assets. ""Trading,"" after all. In practice, trusted exchanges will still have their place to do those HFT activities.

I'm not sure what you're comparing too, but there are many cases where this is demonstrably untrue. Many European counties have free instant transfers.
"interesting.  Why would you waste tens or hundreds of dollars using Bitcoin for that when banks cost much less/nothing? Are you trying to launder your money because maybe that's why it's worth wasting so much money in fees...  no other reason really other than poor financial actions.  Bitcoin is **clearly** not cheaper than using banks

"This is the lie I am talking about.  Original Bitcoin is a fork?  How much are they paying you to push this fucking bullshit?  ""Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin""  ""The original Bitcoin chain is actually a fork... of... Bitcoin Cash"""
I think the point here is that the dream of crypto-currency leading a bank-less equitable society, cannot be achieved by what Bitcoin is now offering. (In fact banks are no doubt making substantial profits as more and more people buy in). The *economy* needs changing - the economy needs to be the store of value, not some market driving by fomo.
Yeah BTC value currently rests on faith and hope. 
"Gold is universal payment method, has had and always will have value. Wherever you go, gold is accepted. It's a precious metal and except being ""shiny"", it has many useful characteristics.

"Interesting investment strategy trusting people that have continuously lied about everything they do

"> I think if it ever reaches that point, there will be an alt around or layer 2 to relieve some pressure

To use an alt, sidechain, or L2 requires you to first make an onchain transaction, you know.

Suggesting people will use an alt to relieve pressure is literally saying, ""people will exit Bitcoin for alts because Bitcoin doesn't work.""

"> If it ever gets to where folks cannot move their coins

I just showed you that for all wallets under a certain amount those funds are now effectively frozen for all time.  They cannot be moved, their value is zero, and whatever value they had has been transferred through deflation (because these coins are now out of circulation) to the wealthier holders.

Confiscation of poor wallets and redistribution to the wealthy.  That's what's happening, right now, on BTC."
I know. It is in you best interest to research as much as you can this week so you can come to a conclusion yourself before it is late
OK I stand corrected I didn't check the exact timeframe. My point was that if you pick a slightly bigger period the market favors BCH.

"While I lean towards the side of big blocks, I don't begrudge either chain. I believe that competition is good and pushes innovation forward. If either chain were to completely fail, that would probably be bad for the cryptocurrency ecosystem as a whole.

I see the best case scenario as both chains existing and constantly trying to out do each other, especially if you are correct about Core recognizing Cash as real competition."
"I really dislike market manipulation conspiracy theories in either direction. Most of all because they're completely unnecessary to explain the market movements.

But also because deep down they don't make a lot of sense. What friend would dump millions of dollars into propping up falsely whatever crypto? What really would there be to gain by these ""friends""? Especially if they know ""the truth"", that BTC is destined to fail?"
Where's your data I can look at?
I expected BCh could surpass Btc but it might not happen in the near future. Besides, why a btc thread is on the front page?
[deleted]
This is actually brilliant! This means that every time BCH price goes up you can buy BTC because they will have to pour fiat into it. Then when the 7/1 balance is restored you can trade the BTC for BCH and wait for another drop in BTC price and profit this way. Basically the BTC/BCH exchange rate is now insured by the corporations invested in BTC.

"> It's a very costly operation, so they've asked friends in Wall Street to help pump BTC above $7000, but that'll just make it even more profitable for people, especially whales, to sell BTC for BCH.

"How can you say it‘s clogged. You realize that there are txs included with fees < 50 sat/byte?

"while I'm not happy with the route BTC is going, lets get something straight here.

The mempool can not clog.  It has infinite size.  Low fee stuff can get stuck forever, but as long as you are willing to pay an arm and a leg for your transaction, it will go through."
Right on Roger's dirty face, BAM!
"Good for Bitcoin, I realised that it has to stay strong for a while until the public is aware of Bitcoin Cash and not only us nerds. 

Keep in mind though, the more expensive BTC gets, the more it has to raise for you to earn from it. Let's say you have 1BTC and it goes up from 7100$ to 7200$, you practically earned around 90$ due to high fees you have to pay when transferring it, and that is a gain of 1,3%. 

You own 1BCH/BCC today and it goes up from 1235$ to 1325$ (so where it was yesterday), a 90$ raise in market value means more than 89$ for you because you don't need to worry about fees, and that is a gain of 7,3%. 

For you to earn 7,3% with BTC, it has to go from 7100$ to 7618$.

I hope this helps to get some perspective. "
"> ave a stranglehold on BTC now understands BCH is a real threat that can evaporate their investment overnight, that constant fear

Why should I trust a chain like BCH when it just implemented a weapon of mass destruction to the entire eco system?

If you are only playing offense, you are opening yourself up to an attack by the alts who need BTC to work.

If you kill the King, you'd better have a quality replacement. I'm still not convinced BCH isn't a lot of miners in China protecting their investments. 

Careful with your strategy. If you just are trying to attack BTC, but add no real innovation, then we will see you as a threat to the whole eco system.

Not saying that's the case, but you need to build a better mousetrap. Kicking the can down the road for scaling ISN'T a solution and anyone with a CS degree can see that.

Give it 48 hours and the traffic jam on the BTC network will be epic. 

The situation still hasn't changed, value aside BTC is not worthy, and it is in huge difficulties on a technical level. 

There is also no real justification for a hike of this magnitude when no other alt coin did... well, much of anything. They didn't even go down, so the money didn't come from alts coins. They went down vs Bitcoin, sure, but that doesn't mean the alts lost any value vs fiat. Just like the BCH hike was engineered, no doubt so was this. It wasn't even people ""fleeing"" BCH, because BCH is holding steady. This was all new fiat, most likely, from people who really want to keep BTC up.

But certainly congratulations to all the holders! For your sake I hope it lasts."
"Or maybe, just MAYBE the market values BTC over BCH, values the future tech proposition of BTC over BCH ? Could that be?
Or is it also a conspiracy by the crab people?

I think you're getting triggered by the title of the [article](https://www.bitcoin.com/info/bitcoin-cash-is-bitcoin), but the body of the article does make a distinction between Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin and looks at their properties to explain which one is more like the Bitcoin our earlier years.
Everybody is free to fork Bitcoin and call it whatever they like. Free markets, decentralization and all that you know.
"This article exposes the bias that Bitcoin is not Bitcoin Cash.

Bitmex decided not to give customers their bcash. Bitmex wi sell all bcash for btc and deposit it in customers account. 
But wait! When you add Bitcoin Gold, the prefork value is .... Probably still $8400, isn't it?
Until it doesn't.
Just wait till the next multi-year bear market.

"""they've asked friends in Wall Street to help pump BTC above $7000""

First, even if this was true (which it isn't), how would *you*, random reddit user, know this?  Do you have inside information?  Care to provide some proof or a source that we can verify your claim with?

This type of comment is seen all the time on penny stock forums, but it usually isn't framed so amateurishly.

The slowness of confirmations and the like only matters if you (a) day trade and need that capital to be available immediately for another trade, or (b) are laundering money.  You realize Mastercard and Visa transactions take **days** to clear, right?

This is all FUD.  You guys bought BCH when the usual suspects duped you into doing so, and now you are stuck holding the bag.  It could take confirmations a month and it wouldn't matter because bitcoin is a long term, multi-year paradigm shift.  It's not a quick flip for some loser balding day trader can cover his alimony payments.

Take your PND silliness to /r/wallstreetbets where it belongs."
Dude give it up. You sound brainwashed. 
This is the most retarded thing I've read all day. Well done.
You don't seem to be aware of the effect that transaction fees have. Bitcoin is widely used, so when blocks aren't moving very quickly transaction fees simply rise a lot until Bitcoin blocks become profitable to mine again. Obviously high transaction fees are far from ideal, but they do make the currency anti-fragile to hashrate flight to temporarily more profitable coins.

"S'like I said below, I just don't know BCH; Never bothered to read much into it or learn about it.

There'll be a time and place for that in the future, but for now I just want one solid BTC, then I'll start looking at diversifying again.

I just don't like holding what I don't know, and working for myself at home leaves little time to research new stuff. Well, that and still working for that one solid coin; After that when I have more money to toss around I'll have more options. A full coin just feels symbolic to me."
"If someone first heard about cryptocurrencies via Bitcoin before BCH existed, never participated in the communities but still bought Bitcoin, and has been consistently buying Bitcoin while watching the prices it is very likely said individual would not know anything about BCH. I didn't know about it until a week or two ago when I finally decided to start reading up on cryptocurrencies, and that is what led me to the subreddits.

It isn't unreasonable at all to expect there are owners of Bitcoin who have never heard of Bitcoin Cash. The cryptocommunities know what it is, but the layperson could very well be ignorant on the matter. I still think that lack of exposure is Bitcoin Cash's biggest weakness, and possibly the main reason Bitcoin Cash hasn't closed that gap with Bitcoin. 

Then again I'm new. What do I know"
"Oh yeah I've had a bit of ETH too; Not much, but as you say, a ""just incase"" amount.

"
"Nah, diversifying.

BTC is what I know, it gets the first full-coin treatment.

Not like I'll stop investing after that; I probably will do more research on BCH and maybe buy some.

As it stands though, I don't know much and life is a tad busy to do tons of research right now; Stick with what I know, eh?"
Holding and not using, hoping other people will do the same, is called a Ponzi scheme. The literal definition of a bubble 
"Less about taking sides, more about wanting my goal of a solid coin to come to completion sooner.

I could've held longer but I'll likely just finish the BTC coin then start putting money I would've put into BTC into BCH if my research at the time supports it.

It's like I skipped a week of fiat trading into BTC to use the bch swing for it. Better than the bch sitting being unused from the fork where I went ""ehhhh? I'll sit on this awhile"".

I just wanna tick over to 1.x instead of 0.x by 2017 end, it's a goal I've aimed for for 6 months."
That awkward moment when you completely lose grasp of reality
Can't these BTC whales just as easily dump their BCH cheap as well, putting downward pressure on the price? I mean when their alts get threatened, they'll do what they can to defend it too.

"Oh give me a break dude, they've asked wall street to help pump? Are you seriously saying that?

Your self interest in this post is blinding. BCH was pumped at unforeseen levels even for crypto.  BTC has been clogged down from spam transactions, which, coincidentally, probably come from the same source as the pump. BCash is centralized far worse than BTC, and lets not even talk about the dwindling volume following the pump. You don't have scale or governance issues because you don't have either right now. 


I'd like to hear a logical rebuttal that doesn't rely on conspiracy and big bad wall street bank stories. That pump was disgusting and bad for crypto overall. Manipulation and FOMO, chickens will come to roost for those involved.  "
so true!
"Imo that ""bch is bitcoin"" is a bit dishonest, even if you feel that it more closely matches the structure of pre-segwit bitcoin.

Why do you impersonate Greg Maxwell with your username? Some sort of power play?

"How much of a Bitcoin sub is this if there is a large population of commenters who will generally agree with the blatant lie that ""Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin"".  How can anybody stand behind that dishonesty?  It the proponents of Bitcoin Cash truly believed that their currency is better, why are they trying so hard to steal the name Bitcoin?  If Bitcoin is the shitcoin that many commenters in this sub like to say it is, why would BCH be trying so hard to steal that name?"

It's okay, we still love you. By far most people in /r/btc and /r/bitcoin like money as much as EA does and for day trading high volatility offers immense opportunities for loosing all your money (or win some).

You made me hop over to coinmarketcap really quickly to see if BCH had 6x price overnight. I was going to do a WTF... and wondered manipulation. 
Curious.. Why? Seems well received here. 
I was confused for a second haha
/u/BashCo is manipulating the votes with his new botnet toy.
Everyone take notice, how this post still has upvotes and there is healthy discussion going on.  It didn't get censored, deleted, downvoted, or anything negative.  It is on the front page and there is plenty of comments discussing both sides of the isle.  Crazy stuff
Agreed but im not sure why the next fork isnt Bitcoin cash. Would reward the holders of the real Bitcoin chain.
"That's correct. Many of us are traders and speculators who look after *our* interests. Not brain-less zealots whose mindset is limited to ""One or the other"".

As with many others here, I had benefited from BCH's recent spike to $2,400. And BTC falling to below $6,000. Once support had been established, we had bought it and just waited. Didn't think it would rebound this fast. Thanks for the quick profits.

By the way, I've moved some of the funds back to BCH. It has established support at around $1,200. Let's see how it goes in the coming days.  "
Post the BCH price in r/bitcoin and see what happens. 😄
That's not why the people who post things like this are after. They're after $$$, that is all.
"$8400

I think this is all time high for one prefork coin."

Impressive? BTC does this ~5 times a year.
"True this. If any form of Bitcoin is to survive and become a true world player and accomplish the goal of taking over fiat money we need a unified ground.

The infighting happening within the Bitcoin community is the biggest weakness to this technology, which is self is wonderful"
Never forget! You rule.
"Ofcourse BTC have to recover, if BTC drops anywhere near $5000 again the entire BTC structure will be evaporated by BCH, the new BCH DAA is deadly.

And that's the beauty of it, the cartel who have a stranglehold on BTC now understands BCH is a real threat that can evaporate their investment overnight, that constant fear will ensure that they have to keep BTC price high at all times.

It's a very costly operation, so they've asked friends in Wall Street to help pump BTC above $7000, but that'll just make it even more profitable for people, especially whales, to sell BTC for BCH.

BTC has a natural weakness: It's unusable, the mempool is constantly clogged.

The BTC foundation is slowly being eaten away but it'll be covered up by price, as BCH gains popularity, bankers have to pay more and more to sustain BTC price, until one day things suddenly flip and BTC enter a free fall.

Then we have the fact that individual bankers are also secretly investing BCH, so when push comes to shove, the bankers will secretly flip for profit too.

What does it mean son?
exactly, btc just going where it was, BCH consolidating a good result, after having scored 2,700$ within 3 months from creation... a result that took years to the old decrepit slow, expensive grandfather.
BTC stays at $7k while BCH goes to $10k?
It's already $10K in my local currency.
I'm mostly worried if one of the chain flops and causes people to lose money but this is the wild wild west time more or less 
This is a such a bullshit manipulated thread. 100%. 
"It's comfy owning both since before the fork. I can support the one I prefer, but if the other wins, well, I still get rich as a consolation.

And thanks to the Cash increase my overall portfolio is higher since before the shitstorm, and I didn't even have to touch my cold storage."
"Volumes are back to normal on all chains...

Guess what happens when there is no market manipulation happening?

BTC is on a league of it's own, compared to alt coins.

And to the guy claiming vote manipulation.

Who knows, but that's better than the obvious market manipulation we saw in South Korea, who then closed the doors for everyone there with the ""crash"" to prevent them from selling their BCH, while they tanked BCH 1000 dollars under 5 minutes elsewhere."
Bitmex doesn't know Bcash, there is no coin with this name.

Hi hi hi you're being naive, last weekend was only a test run, make sure you keep your BTC in an exchange so you can sell them fast when the next freeze occurs.

"do you mean the guy who put all his money into bitcoin and owes great success to bitcoin and started a bitcoin company to promote bitcoin?

that guy is the bad guy?"
Yeah, I support bitcoin too, just not the bitcoin-core version, but instead the one I actually got into that people can use and has potential use 
Please do your future a service and actually look into the inner workings and details. Don't be defensive or scared. 
Or the obvious manipulation we've seen pushing BTC over $7k while fees skyrocket.  BTC is truly a rich man's coin.  Enjoy it while it lasts kid.
Soon we will get Bitcoin Clashic!!
"This is how Bitcoin is supposed to work. If you don’t like where bitcoin is heading you can create a fork and let the market decide.

I get that you might not like larger blocks or whatever but calling it dishonest, scam, alt, shitcoin e.tc. is so weird. Bitcoin is open and anyone can fork it. Without that bitcoin could be hijacked by a development team."
"It's a matter of definition. The people that follow BCH are also of the opinion that the original whitepaper should not be discarded unless nessecary and that one states that Bitcoin is:

> The majority
decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested
in it.

So any forked should be considered Bitcoin as long as this applied. The inclusion of Segwit is enough for some people for it to not be considered 'valid' anymore, for the other side it's the inclusion of the EDA and DAA. Fact is, if you follow the whitepaper, then these rules apply and whatever chain accumulates the most proof-of-work will be Bitcoin. BCH is way behind, but if it could hold the majority hashrate it'd get there eventually and that's why people say ""Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin"". I don't get why this is such a hard concept for some people."
Damn! the biggest problem of btc (cash) are these reddits! so degrading. How many from Cornell here?
I notice your comment hasn't been deleted here?! I need say no more.

This is in fact still a bitcoin sub. bitcoin-core is relevant.

If you know got to know bitcoin in its early days you definitely know bitcoin cash now. "
It is a good symbolic value. My advice is ones you reach 1 full BTC to accumulate some ETH and BCH. Sometimes it feels great to watch the value shift between the coins and your portfolio keeps a constant price :) If you want to participate in the speculation you still can and you are even in a better position because at least some of your capital can be moved to exchanges fast and with low fees.
trade your btc for bcc.  you'll have more than one full bitcoin, the real bitcoin.  bcc is the only bitcoin that can scale to run the new financial system for the entire world.  
Great job. Dump the shit for more BTC. Don't let the fudsters, weak hands, and jealous people confuse you. HODL
BCH is no less the coin you've owned for years than BTC is. Bitcoin=BCH+BTC. Choosing to take sides is risky but could pay off. 
"That was exactly the point.

It's going to take a while for BTC whales to move all their BTC into BCH without jacking up the BCH price to above $10000.

So we make sure Blockstream Core understand that if BTC price falls below $5000, BTC can flip within hours.

Their handlers who understand prices but don't understand the tech, would read about it and then panic, and tell their minions to keep BTC price above $6600 at all costs, they'll also increase their smearing on BCH to help keep the BCH price low.

This will guarantee at least 2-4 weeks of smooth and very profitable transition from BTC to BCH.

They'll even hire shills to bad mouth BCH to maintain the price distance, so you can keep buying BCH at low prices.

Meanwhile BCH will remain fast and will gain more and more merchants support, and BTC will stay slow and unusable."

">The never ending pump could become a thing. It would cause both coins to meet in the middle.

Yes, and the bankers can't let that happen. Once BTC and BCH prices are close, one nicely timed massive flood to the BTC mempool, will create a snowball exit effect on the next BTC price drop.

If BTC mempool is clogged again and BCH price is close, and you'll have to wait 72 hours to cash out BTC again, the Bithumb lesson will remind BTC traders to at least begin unloading some or all of their BTC, which would still create a snowball effect as long as the mempool flood is effective enough.

One failed cash out leads to panic, which leads to another failed cash out, and then another panic.

They have to keep paying to maintain a price distance.

BTC has 14 days of lifetime when that happens
BAM! /u/BashCo 's vote manipulation botnet running at full speed :)
I'm not disagreeing with you, just pointing out if you check the memepool, a 50 sat/byte transaction hasn't been included in a block for over 4 days now. I'd rather use a bank transfer, that is quicker than a 4 day confirmation!

"The thing is, they are talking about USDT, which have no proven reserve value and are being issued like crazy at times that coincide with BTC price drops.

>The slowness of confirmations and the like only matters if you (a) day trade and need that capital to be available immediately for another trade, or (b) are laundering money.

LOL so the massive crying for help a few days ago from all the people who was stuck in the BTC mempool were all day traders or money launderers?

What happened to the Bitcoin Core shill ""Bitcoin is digital gold"" and ""store of value"" argument? What about the ""store of value"" people who wanted to cut losses?

"BTC is being boosted by USDTethers newly printed out of thin air.

You find a figure head that people think represents wealth, and then tell everyone that guy is jumping in.


>BCash is centralized far worse than BTC

Oh, a Blockstream Core shill. That explains it.
"
Same!
Lets be honest, with every honest transaction there are two or three emotionless whale gods playing with us mortal pawns transactions. BCH was a huge coordinated pump.
"I'm the warmest one here

$1 /u/tippr"
Yes. I sold at 6350. I've been through alot with btc. Since 2010-11. Thinking about buying some up again next dip. It's just hard to buy into what the btc is now. For me it's a broken dream in its current state. Sad about it.
Most of us contributed to r\bitcoin for years and found outselves randomly banned, we're just people
 everyone upvote this thread! Let's end the bitcoin divorce and unite under the r/btc flag, where intellectual discussion and unpopular opinions are welcome. 
MRW English isn't my first language. 
"Hahahahaha 

Ah you, good one.

108 bits /u/tippr"
Honestly Bitcoin Gold is a pure mystery to me. To begin with I cannot understand if it exists or what is traded is futures. Second I can't understand why it has value greater than 0. For me this fork is totally pointless. They want to mine Bitcoin on video cards to prevent economies of scale but even with video cards economies of scale still kick in and they do so sooner than later. There will be insignificant delay in centralization due to economies of scale i.e. the fork is pointless.
"I am *so* glad I sold my BCH at $1500 and bought the same in BTC when it was $~6k flat.

Not for any drama reasons mind you, just... Never bothered to look much into BCH or care much for it. I'm still aiming for my end-goal of one *full* BTC Coin before the end of 2017, so the fork just gave me a chance to hold BCH til a good sell point, which this certainly turned out to be. BTC is just the coin I've known for years and, well, close to one coin makes me wanna just get that last bit and just complete a personal goal of sorts.

"
This is an insider's game, to make a great hero you gotta have an equally bad ass villain, it's a win win for both BTC and BCH.
More importantly, BTC + BCH is over $8300 at the time of this writing. Hodl on!
Who are the 3-4 maintainers?
Good, that means those who dump their BTC will get more BCH.
It's beyond dishonest, it's pure propaganda to push a very specific agenda that benefits Roger Ver and his cohort
"> I'm dishonest?

No, that doesn't look much dishonest to me.

A bitcoin from before the fork is 1 BT1 + 1 BCH.

By now ""Bitcoin"" and ""BTC"" is equivalent with BT1, (almost) nobody is arguing against that."
Maybe not dishonest but factually incorrect.  Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin Cash and it is not Bitcoin.  Bitcoin is Bitcoin and it is not Bitcoin Cash.  Two different currencies, two different networks, two different names.  Bitcoin Cash is not Bitcoin.  
"This is a valid observation and I will not deflect from it.  The censorship over at /r/bitcoin is getting beyond terrible, and I find myself less and less interested in going to that sub for any kind of reasonable discussion.

Having said that, there is a lie being pushed by Roger Ver on Bitcoin.com that ""Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin"", and this, in my opinion, is the number one problem I have with the entire BCH philosophy, and it extends to anyone who supports that blatant lie.  They are two different COMPETING currencies with two different names.  Just because he hasn't censored my comments about this does not make my position any less valid.  The day that I start getting censored on this sub is the day that I know for a fact that BCH is beyond fraudulent."
"BCH is BCH. BTC is BTC. Simple as that no need for further explanation. 

Many people including Jihan Wu agree. "
"The only people who say that are trying to trick noobies and riding the coat tails of bitcoins name recognition.

Plain and simple.

Bitcoin cash is NOT Bitcoin.

Bitcoin cash is slumping and losing hash rate..... Bitcoin is gaining hash rate and the price is rising.

They aren't the same thing."
Yeah, that would be impressive :)

The 1MB limit that was imposed was necessary at the time. 
"Calling BCH ""Bitcoin"" is fake news of the highest order"
"I guess the censorship on r/bitcoin worked.

Hard forking is what sold me on Bitcoin. No entity can hijack a currency that just forks. The recent years fud over there and on twitter has been troubling."
"> **BCH is way behind**, but if it could hold the majority hashrate it'd get there eventually and that's why people say ""Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin""

You yourself said that it's way behind. Until it's no longer behind, it's not Bitcoin. "
Not being funny but in the history of software forks, no decent developer has ever forked an existing and very active project and then tried to commandeer the original project's name against their wishes.  (probably)
"> Bitcoin is open and anyone can fork it. Without that bitcoin could be hijacked by a development team.

Golden :-)

But that is actually the biggest advantages with a free software project, if one doesn't like the direction the software maintainers is going, one can fork it and own it.

The Bitcoin Core github repo is controlled by some 3-4 maintainers, those have the ultimate veto power and can block anything they want - and it was [already predicted two years ago](https://medium.com/@octskyward/on-block-sizes-e047bc9f830) that we will never get a block size increase as long as the current maintainers are in charge.

Now, Bitcoin Core is more than a software, it's also the reference implementation of the Bitcoin protocol - and protocols are a quite different beast than software.  The network effect is very strong, it's always hard to challenge the incumbent.

In general, it's [a bad idea to create yet another standard](https://xkcd.com/927/), from that perspective I was a bit against the Bitcoin Cash project at it's inception (what's wrong with ethereum, dash, zcash, monero, etc?).  Ideally we should have *one* strong crypto currency usable for ordinary payments - and since Bitcoin is unusable for ordinary payments, it can't be Bitcoin.  With hundreds of different alts to chose between, we have no chance challenging the established payments systems.

I actually think I would have been much more comfortable if some newer, more modern crypto-currency would have dethroned the Segwit1X-Bitcoin - but Bitcoin Cash seems to be the most viable alternative at the moment, so I support Bitcoin Cash."
Just remember why we all want bitcoin or any other coin. Because fuck the banks. Never forget.
Thanks for the tip sport.
ahahh you guys supporter of speculative segwit coin can only say shit, bcash and all the stupid joke because the truth is you are shitting your pant off, probably you are not sleeping at all always checking the price for your coin, since it could drop all of sudden for some speculative move... enjoy the gambling and good night
Just not at *this* time.
How can you belong to r/btc and now know what bcash is. Anyways, here is the link. This might explain why btc is back above $7k https://blog.bitmex.com/bitcoin-cash-futures-now-live/
You can remind yourself in day you like. Bitcoin is ready for all.
Just wondering but how much time have you spent reading the white paper? I would argue that people who always say that consensus rules, most of them have not read the white paper because if they did then it's hard to not see how BTC is a mutation of what it was supposed to be. 
The only way I will invest in Bitcoin is if Bitcoin cash absolutely crashes but other than that I don't care if Bitcoin goes to $15,000 and Bitcoin cash stays under $2,000 Bitcoin is not a usable coin so to me it is not worth anything the fact that people are paying $15,000 for it is the same reason people would pay $500 for a Beanie Baby
Can't wait
"And how many developers have commit access to the BCH repo? They are the same gatekeepers with veto access. If I submitted Segwit code to the BCH repo it would be rejected, just like a block size increase would be rejected by the maintainers of the BTC repo.

This is not because these people have a veto it's because these things are discussed in forums or mailing lists and have been decided that it's not compatible with the project. Which is why you fork off, let the best method win."
I am posting this from outside.
The truth equals downvotes somehow. 
"I work in an industry that is actively looking at blockchain solutions to everyday problems. 

People that are very knowledgeable about blockchain no fuck all about BCH. It is going to be very difficult to get these people to start thinking about BCH when they've already spent so long trying to understand BTC. "
"You do know that the BCH price jumped from $250 to $2500 in a matter of days and is now consolidating at $1200?

"maybe you confuse with the great coin BitcoinCash which is currently 38% more profitable than old slow/expensive segwit bitcoin ... and not just that, it is very inexpensive and fast. 
How is that? It is usable both for users and miners.... when more wealth will move there, there will be no more need for your coin.

"Manipulation has become the ""god of the gaps"" on both subs. People need to realize market manipulation is very expensive (need to be a whale), very risky (won't be a whale for long if you keep it up), and draws in a ton of anti-manipulation traders who specialize in taking the manipulator's money, so it is self-limiting and inoculating. It's something that can be done a few times in immature markets before savvy traders flock to the market like vultures to eat the manipulator's free money, standing ready to eat it faster next time the manipulator wants to try."

">Or maybe, just MAYBE the market values BTC over BCH, values the future tech proposition of BTC over BCH ?

""The market"" relies on information to make decisions. When the communication channels are censored from criticism and only a select group of hallowed experts are permitted to have a valid opinion, the market can be expected to bet incorrectly on such imperfect information. A wise trader could do very well for himself if he had access to an unfiltered source of facts on which to trade against the misinformed masses.

One merely needs to understand the underlying fucked up echo chamber culture of BTC and really that's all you need to know to make an informed bet against the long term prospects of that platform.  But you'd need to know the facts and you'd need a background in management not software or cryptography to be able to spot the opportunity.  Not many of those people out there in this space it turns out.

If you have a thirty year background in info tech as I do then it's also pretty easy to spot vaporware, which is another big piece of disinformation ""the market"" is getting about BTC. "
I think people are brainwashed by the censorship on r/bitcoin. Try asking who funded Blockstream there and see what happens to you. 
Bcash isn't a thing.
"It could. BCH is up 100% last month BTC is down a couple of percent.

"
"Newly created tether affects BCH just as much as BTC.

In fact, during the last big BCH pump, The BCH-Tether pair was the 2nd largest trading pair by volume.  *All* of that volume was from Tether."
"serious question, what exactly do you think the market values about it?  It's expensive to use features?  It's extremely long confirmation times?

I see this as a rebuttal many times (maybe they value it more), but still have not figured anything out that is even remotely valuable about that strangled network anymore that has absolutely zero room for growth and it has MAYBE 1% of the world using it and overloading it already"
"Just shifting the Overton window, 20 years ahead of time ;)"
I added one last point I wanted to make a second ago. There is a moral debate to be had if purposefully popping a bubble like BTC is right.
Someone add dogecoin to the chart!
[deleted]
"> So BTC and BCH have completely separate use cases. So why is there a war?

Because it sheds light on the fact that BTC is actually a bubble. Think about it. The coin itself sucks ass, any other coin would be a better choice for now. The only reason why its kept is that so many people are building infrastructure around it.

They are propping up an inferior coin. So if we go down this ""coin war"" then BTC wont hold up against BCH or Dash Or LTC.

The main functionality of BTC is that its a bubble. That's not a ""use case"" its a big problem if people start trying to pop it. At the same time, if we leave the bubble alone. It will be worth around 10k in a few months.

Your choice I guess.."
"Keep a constant small block reward.

This will cause some slow, diminishing, inflation over the years."
So remove the 21M cap? Good luck getting consensus on that.

"> Bitcoin for the last bunch of years has been an investment opportunity. Sorry that’s the unfortunate truth, it’s been controlled by the rich for a long ass time.

Which is actually an effective argument that BTC is a superior storage of wealth. Right now I think that BTC is going to be on its way to 8k each. But I wont really consider using BTC for small transactions after this fiasco anymore."
"Very little block reward? Instead of 12.5 BTC valued at $6700 each, the reward would be 3.125 BTC valued at what might be a *much* bigger number.

I suspect a 0.5 BTC/BCH tail emission may be needed eventually. We are talking ~20 years though.

I wish there was a place where actual technical comparisons were done, with reproducible results and cited sources, etc.

I'm sure that both LTC and BCH have their pros and cons."
Litecoin has Segwit, no clear roadmap and less immutable
EL OH EL
Blockstream stifled Bitcoin as a project and everyone is pissed off about it. The revolution was delayed. There's nothing wrong about bashing open blockchain with ridiculous fees
It created to remove blocksize limit eventually, if we'll have Blockstream 2.0 at 8MB, the whole chain split thing will just repeat, but I think we'll go more smoothly from here
U should choose a reliable open blockchain for all important txs
Has Segwit, lower network effect, same scaling issues as BTC, less immutable
It's not an immutable open blockchain, though
I love how all rbtc community act like its a revolutinary technology suddenly increasing block size. Bcash would be exactly same if same people trying to fill btc mempool do it for bcash. 
"> 24 transactions a second

No. Roadmap is - no blocksize limit"
"Yes and the miners who are the ones paying for hashrate are the ones that can decide which transactions are economically rational to include in the next block. A natural equilibrium will emerge and this will fluctuate based on supply, demand and technological improvement.

Right now on the BTC chain, miners are being forced to leave transactions unmined due to the artificial constraint. Resulting in a backlog. Leaving the chain vulnerable to potential DOS attack. That’s what is unsustainable right now.

Not fixing that because of some worry over a theoretical future scenario, is not pragmatic. "

Technically, legacy Bitcoin ignores segwit.

You can still use non segwit addresses with bitcoin. Those addresses are legacy bitcoin.

Yeah I get it. It's for the rich/bankers. Everyone will be credited their low amount of bitcoin on layer 2/3 and they won't care. It really will be gold 2.0 until it's fractional reserve bitcoin going on then people will buy cash, eth, etc to hedge. For people who want to audit the layer 2/3 corps like you and me, we will already have our money in something else. At least we have the freedom to choose now. 
"There is no point in using a crypto asset as a utility (actually spending it) until it reaches maturity. It's quite silly to do so, actually. 

For instance, if you bought a Television in 2013 with BTC for around $2000, that would be 153 BTC @ $13/BTC that you sent away. Today, that $2000 investment/those 153 BTCs are now worth  $1,050,192 at current price of $6864/BTC. so you lost over $1 million in unrealized gains in a four year span by sending away a currency before it had matured.

The same can be said for any constantly rising asset. If you went to a bar and bought $40 worth of alcohol for about 0.12 BCH @ $330/BCH, it's like you really spent $156 for a few rounds of drinks in unrealized gains as it now sits around ~$1300/BCH.

The utility aspect won't come for a long time, after all, less than 1% if the global population is actively participating in the crypto scene, much less are even aware it exists. 

Currencies are required to be stable in order to incentivize people to actually use them as such. Otherwise they will just spend fiat, as the price of the USD FRN doesn't have radical volatility. In economics, this is called Gresham's Law--'good' money exits the economy and the 'bad' money is what circulates (fiat sovereign currencies).

This is why Litecoin's stability in price is actually a good thing if it's to be used as a currency for day-to-day expenses like Charlie sateted on CNBC.

It will reach a tipping point, but the crypto market needs to capture trillions before this ever happens. That's why you HODL for now. "
You might get it but majority doesn't. majority always just follows others... they just don't know how to think for themselves.
"If you're running all nodes on the same IP then you're not helping much; and unfortunately, the reward for running a non-mining full node is very indirect, and at least in the short term it's unlikely to pay the electricity bill, so it's mostly volunteer work that probably can't be done at large scales by people without a lot of money to spare.

I'm not even sure if nowadays there is any country actually trying to block access to foreign miners; so it's more of a lets be ready for when it's needed kinda thing."
Rubbish. You are saying no one who bought their coins should spend it as it will take decades for them to reach everyone having them... fact is people need to use them, long before they die.
"Shows how shitty your thinking is by saying ""measly $2000 cost"".
FACT is only VERY SMALL NUMBER of people are ever possibly able to get a coin or more. This is a TINY FRACTION OF THE WORLD'S POPULATION. How will the rest of the world that might be able to afford small tiny fraction of a coin to ever be able to use it? There are billions of people living on fraction of that ""measly $2000"" per day... you expect people who have no money to invest to afford these fees?

You are MENTAL and you don't understand the fucking basics of what Bitcoin is meant to achieve, so just stop talking shit."
"It's much much easier for one person to run 1000 nodes than 1000* 1 node per person. Different/dynamic IPs are not any problem.

There is no economic incentive for the average joe to run full nodes, **because** non-mining nodes contribute nothing to Bitcoin network. It would be a bug if the network provides the reward for trash activities.

The stupid 'non-mining full nodes are necessary' narrative couldn't have spread so widely without the help of censorship."
"Non-mining full nodes do make a difference when a country is trying to block access to foreign miners, as I explained. You didn't counter that.

If I could afford 1000 different IP addresses and the associated hardware to have one full node on each of those IPs, I would.

|

There is also something I forgot to mention at the start of the conversation. Another thing where having non-mining full nodes helps, is with the trustworthiness of zero-confs; by having a large number of hops between user and miner who do not benefit from replacing transactions with higher fee ones, it makes it much harder for double-spends to reach miners."
"The economic majority is still there with Core's BTC, that much is obvious, but some of us know that reality always lags a bit, and it takes time for the masses to realise what the reality is, and then the economic majority will follow.

Fact is pretty much everyone (with some rare exceptions) is in crypto as investment. But as soon as utility comes into this world and businesses start accepting it in masses, people will want to use their coins, and those that turn out to not be usable... will be rejected and people will switch to what is usable.

This WILL happen sooner or later, and this is why ""just store of value"" is not actually doable."
That theoretical transaction capability increase only works if  transactions actually support segwit. Which the vast majority does not. So still roughly 8 times more.
"Fact is price will continue to rise. That's an objective fact. So, honestly, that's on you if you want to lose out on unrealized gains by spending a currency before it's reached maturity. It's pretty clear-cut.

This is because people are HODLing:

http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-11-13/irs-puzzled-why-out-500000-coinbase-users-only-900-reported-gains-or-losses

So, it's rubbish that sending 153 BTC away four years ago at a measly $2000 cost is now worth $1 million? No, it's not. That's factual and proof positive that the currency is immature along with every other crypto asset. *We are in the infancy stages.* **When it becomes mainstream it's a completely different story**. We are a long way from that. "
"Nonsense. If the Government doesn't allow mining activities within it's country, they can easily shut down the mining farms, instead of blocking the relay IPs. 

Also, in the weird case you imagined, the miner can easily set a full node abroad with clouding services, and change the ip daily if not weekly, quite easily."
"What? 1 minute per day means 1/1440 less time on average.

1 minute per week means 1/10080  less time on average.

Also, if the non-mining nodes really had the usage as you claimed, why no one was proud to 'help' the network by running 1000 nodes. By your argument, 1000 nodes by one single person = 1000 * 1 node per person."
Are you saying that there's no block size limit in BCH? I could have sworn it was bitcoin's doubled... 
"Look at your tone. GG dude. You cannot assess anything in an objective manner. It's measly compared to the return that was generated simply by not spending it and holding onto it as it matured! That's objectively obvious. Exactly, the cost grows exponentially higher as time progresses that's why it's best to try to obtain a single coin now. And even better in the past and that is the very reason why people that had been lucky enough to obtain one or more should be holding.

You have an inability to hear or understand what people are saying to you and I suppose just insist on forcing your view onto people. I'm about to drop a voice memo on you as a response if you respond with something absurd again.

And Wtf is your problem? I'm not talking shit. Just because you disagree with me? Wtf. I'm stating objective facts about the historic price movements and suggesting it's wise to hold onto the asset based on those price movements.

As I said, **if you want to spend a currency before it has matured** go ahead and operate that way. That's your choice. "
"I'm talking about blocking connection to the rest of the world.

And yeah, a miner could switch to using dynamic IPs, but that would cause occasional disruption to the connection to the other miners when the IP changes, potentially costing the miner the time to get a block first."
My understanding there's no hardcoded limit that requires a fork to increase. The client implementations have a limit on blocks they consider valid all are at least 8. if we end up needing more than that node's and miners can configure the software to accept bigger blocks.
"It's around 8 times the effective capacity of the Core chain.

There is a limit, but it's just there to curb spikes; once the limit starts to get hit more routinely, the plan is to increase it, and that can be done by just changing a setting, no need for getting new binaries (and in fact, Bitcoin Unlimited nodes by default will already accept blocks up to 16mb IIRC; and if the majority chain has blocks bigger than that and is at least something like 12 blocks ahead of the chain the node is currently following, it will ignore the currently set limit and go with that instead)."
"They increase the network's censorship resistance a little bit, by providing alternate routes to miners; with non-mining full nodes censoring countries have to try to block a much bigger number of IPs, most of which are actually dynamic IPs, so they can't just do it once, they need to keep looking for new ones all the time. They doesn't make the network censorship proof, but they do make it so censoring countries have to do a little more work to try to censor the network."
You have no idea about centralization. You heard that term from the propaganda of Blockstream Core and echoed it everywhere.
"I was proving that's nonsense to block connection to the rest of the world while keeping mining activities legal since it's so easy to identify large mining activities nowadays.


The 'switch' would only cost less than 1 minute each time. I don't think 1 min per day or week could be seen as 'occasional disruption'. If you still don't believe it, please check the 'switch' between BCore and Bitcoin Cash. 
"
Can you provide a source for this? The limit is only set by the individual miners and isn't a consensus rule? 
That 1 minute means 10% less time to find a block on average. Are most miners both able to afford that loss and willing to?
"The original bitcoin spec had no limit on block size.

The software didn't create messages larger than 32 Mb.

It was later limited to 1 Mb.

So... if a fork moves toward the original spec, which one is more bitcoin? "
Yes. We're on the same side. I always believed that full nodes should serve groups of people. Like a town or community or business. But the amazing thing about SPV nodes is that your friends don't even need to trust your node, they can connect to many different nodes.
Whatever
