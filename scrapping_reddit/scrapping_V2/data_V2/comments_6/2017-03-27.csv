To say that eth is a bad bet because it might one day suffer bitcoin's fate is very speculative.  That might not happen or eth might handle it better than bitcoin did.  Besides, even if it does happen price might rise significantly higher before it happens and smart investors will have time to get out before it falls, just like we got out of bitcoin.
Highly intelligent reply
"because dash and monero are both ""just"" cryptotokens (like eth). ethereum themself is a whole dev environment for all kinds of decentralized solutions (with eth as fuel and as soon pos is implemented with eth value protecting the whole thing)."
Monero transactions are 25x the size of bitcoins'. Definitely will have scaling issues. 
"You mad?

If BU has already lost, why get so worked up about it here?"
"The doers are the usual suspects, those that have used our current world-order to consolidate their power. The financial elites, the establishment, everybody who benefits from the growth of wealth inequality. Old and new money. Power is self perpetuating, if you have enough of it, a posse of vassals condenses around it tending to it like white blood cells tend to the integrity of your body.

What they do (where doing mostly refers to their immune systems response) is detect a pest that could be a nuisance and let their white blood cells inhibit the pest while their bone marrow figures out an antibody. I.e. they attack the intruder and and keep attacking till they find a way to kill it, and it's all an unconscious response to any challenge no matter how slight.

What they have been doing to Bitcoin was trying to find a central point to attack, and not finding any. Then trying to legislate it out of existence, but this was only a half-hearted immune response because it's basically pointless. So finally they figured out a way to attack it, which is to destroy it from within."
Valid concerns. Currently the choice is between the people behind both Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as their developer community as a whole. That's one of the reasons I'm out of Bitcoin and into Ethereum as well.
Correct. Market cap parity would mean ETH around 250$ at the moment.
Keep your feet on the ground. I've moved to Ethereum as well, for obvious reasons, but these kind of cultish anti-Bitcoin ramblings are not very mature. Ethereum has a lot to thank for the accomplishments of Bitcoin.
"Exactly. If he's all in on Ethereum then he should hope bitcoin burns. But now when Bitcoin hits 3k++ he can tell his friend ""well I was rooting for Bitcoin all along"" and save some face.   GTFO!"
Who's the gardener and what are they going to do to 'pluck out Ethereum'?
This rhetoric is valid to some degree if the choice would be between Bitcoin and non-crypto assets. That is not the case though.
"> [/r/bitcoin] /r/btc mod quit for ethereum, another evidence btc was a front to pump alts by undermining bitcoin

LOL. See this is why more and more people are defecting. Nobody with a brain is going to see that title and think ""oh yeah, sounds reasonable."" "
"Disclaimer: Technology Ad. This entire sub is full of Tech pumpers, so not surprised.

*fixed it for you"
so true
"Because here censorship isn't an issue... here people have critical thinking stills, are pragmatic, and reasonable. The facts speak for themselves. Ethereum is now 1/3 of Bitcoins marketcap... and growing. It has rapidly out innovated Bitcoin and has received more business support that Bitcoin ever did. It has Raiden coming out next month which is just the Lightning Network years before Lightning will ever be ready for Bitcoin... 

People here are informed and thus won't go down with the ship. People in rBitcoin and censored and force fed a narrative of low information to keep them in line. All discussion about other innovations is banned...  and thus when somethign like Ethereum gains real moment... all of rBitcoin will go down with the ship and lose everything. Meanwhile people here will simply get on the lifeboat, go to another ship, carry on and make more money. "
You summarized 2/3 of BU shills.
It seems full of those convinced Bitcoin is now beyond hope after years of hanging on. There is only so much we'll accept before just calling it a day and moving on. Bitoin has to compete now, and it is failing to do so at even a basic level. 
It takes a rather large amount of money and/or power to sway such a large number of devs and hire so many shills/trolls for so many years.  Where is that money coming from?  Follow the money and you will find your answers.  Others have done some of this work already, but I do recommend you try to pick up the strings yourself.  
"Not gonna happen ;) You'll have to deal the the fork that I can tell you. "
Bitcoin can survive a hard fork easily with 75-80% hash rate, the problem is that Core supported will burn everything down in the process... killing the price, poisoning the community and making Bitcoin the MySpace of Cryptos
"How do you deal with your taxation when ordering with bitcoin? Just seems like so much effort. 

I assume you're not doing it?"
"No, the difference is having a universal standard which is called a blockchain. Your SQL database is probably some shitty developer implementation.
A blockchain is built by hundreds, if not thousands of devs.
Just like building interactive websites was made much easier when angularjs came, you need a bunch of smart devs to make a money database that everyone in the world can use.

The institutions that support Ethereum may be different from those that are attacking Bitcoin.  
"It's either could **HAVE** or could**'VE**, but never could **OF**. 

 See [Grammar Errors](http://www.grammarerrors.com/grammar/could-of-would-of-should-of/) for more information."
Try estimating when all of that finally happens. By that time Ethereum will be several steps further as well. That's what years of stagnation does in the tech space.
"Why did AXA and the Bilderberg group finance Blockstream which has turned out to be the worst thing that happened to Bitcoin in its existence? Hardly seems like prudent investment strategy now does it? Pissing away millions just to make it fail...

If you're asking for the reason, I believe it's staring you in the face."
A question: If Dash is a drop-in replacement for Bitcoin, does that mean a Bitcoin being run on BU protocol would be very much more competitive with Dash?
Dash has all the signals of being a manipulated pump and dump to me. I think we'll see a lot of bag holders trying to talk it back up, but with so many red flags... Stay safe and objective. Good luck.
I hope not Roger Ver...
I've watched Bitcoin dump $300 in 2 hours, today's cute little pump in bear city doesn't mean much
This is why I don't think Bitcoin will disappear.  There's just too much damned money in it.  The only alternative is a major crash which I think would be a major wak up to everyone involved to get their shit together.  That would likely stall much of the general-public use, but I doubt it would kill it entirely.
Agree.  Can't say the same about Bitcoin *price* though.  That's definitely going somewhere...
Was there an argument in there somewhere that I missed? 
"The toxicity frankly comes from both sides of the debate. To put it in an old saying:

""While two dogs are fighting for a bone, a third runs away with it."""
If he sold BTC and bought ETH, he made a ton of money.
"Add in the ZERO running smart contracts. Ive been following ETH for years now. bough in at at around 2.50 and also hopped on the Augur presale. Ive yet to see an actual running customer facing smart contract. 

The only one i interacted with the DAO and we know how that went. 

Can someone point to me a cool smart contract that i can use today? "
Open source projects often have leaders. It doesn't mean they are authoritarians, it means the project has a vision than can walk and talk. Imagine if Satoshi had stuck around... we wouldn't be in this mess with core. 
as an aside, what is your view on Monero?
"I  can see where you are coming from with most of this, but I feel it is coming from a place of denial more than critical analysis.

This tech is rewriting the social contract as to what ""sound money"" even is to us. It isn't ""sound money"" to me when 10 or so people can hold my money and the network it depends on hostage out of hostility or ignorance. A relatively small amount of capital is all it took to turn Bitcoin on it's head, and that is unacceptable and definitely not ""anti-fragile"". Any millionaire or VC can build a mining farm and buy a vote and pay off any dev it wants to. A system like that is already what we have in use today full of lobbyist pricks and special interests. 

I don't believe the  Core devs did this more than Bitcoin's flawed design did, it is just a byproduct of the root issue. The second ASICs came on to the scene and millionaire backers shoved out normal users from voting, nothing Satoshi even considered, was the beginning of the end as a gross distortion to what the project was originally about: a truly peer to peer cash system where all real users had a say as miners doing some work for the network.  Ethereum does this way better than Bitcoin ever did or could have. It is ok to admit that maybe Bitcoin isn't the best way to do what Satoshi was after, just the first attempt to do so as the first working example of a merkle blockchain, there was no way to know how it would turn out as an experiment.  We know it now, and Bitcoin has serious deficiencies that its consensus mechanisms failed to address. Even if a HF happens soon, this same fundamental problem will continue to bite the project going forward. A simple scaling increase was too much to ask for 3 years, what about bigger changes later? 

The investors did largely approve that rollback on the basis of Ethereum still being in beta essentially, and the minority miners who disagreed were allowed to go off on their own, exactly as blockchains are designed to work, so I don't see what the problem is. 

I don't know if Ethereum is it, but I know Bitcoin is definitely not it at this point. I had to overcome a lot of nostalgia to decide it was time to invest my time and energy elsewhere. I will never touch BTC again as long as Blockstream is involved in any way, that much is certain. I do hope you won't dismiss Ethereum without taking a serious look.

"
Good analysis. I can finally say I agree with most of what you wrote. 
"> The move to full Market Governance is always a rocky one

This is probably the best part of what I've read about Bitcoin in a while - some true insight into the nature of the entire 2-3 years of discussion. /u/ForkiusMaximus, I do generally read and value your comments about Bitcoin governance.

I had some other counterpoints of varying importance I thought of discussing, but I'll really highlight this:

-The current situation is an (another?) example of the weakness of PoW.  All of the discussion about centralization and, more recently, of Developers vs. Miners highlights the conceptual error of PoW.  ASICs, economy of scale, lack of incentive for non-mining nodes, free / cheap electricity in geographical regions - all of those things indicate that PoW will fail.  It's a topic that has been discussed and worried about for some time.  Is PoW an ideal like communism - it works on paper but is simply screwed up when you get enough people involved? 

Other comments in short -Community around Bitcoin is almost self-destructive even near the ATH in price.  -Quite a few other altcoins (more than Ethereum) are implementing solutions to Bitcoin's problems and aren't carrying its baggage.  [Smart contracts, their own versions of LN, governance within the network, node incentives, obscured / truly anonymous transactions, various versions of PoS or other decentralizing techniques, blockchain sharding / merge mining, mimblewimble, no blocksize limit :-) ]   -From a transaction perspective, there is little reason for me to hold Bitcoin instead of buy-and-use.  From an investment perspective, it's about risk vs. reward potential.  -Along the lines of your inflammatory comment, ""Greg Maxwell"""
"I remember your name very well and I wouldn't call it, ""spending some time in the Ethereum subreddits last summer"" over you were trolling the shit out of the ethereum subs : )"
If hes willing to abandon ship like this, I say its better that hes gone sooner than later.
It would be reduced to a niche thing though. The prices would go down down down. Or not. It all depends on perception. If the bitcoin community/alt community can make the journalists sell the story that the banks destroyed bitcoin then it might have a chance, but if the perception that it is some inherent failure of bitcoin gets sold... youre going to get a niche market.
Just goes to show confidence is reaching all time lows
"It's true.  Ask anyone on the street about Ethereum and they have no fucking clue what it is.  Everyone has at least heard of Bitcoin.

If Bitcoin fails though, it'll be all over the news.  It's failure would cast a pall on all other cryptocurrency.

Basically, it's all well and good if you're an enthusiast, but at the end of the day, for crypto to work, the average person needs to get in on it."
"I am a relatively disengaged investor (of very small amount, like many).  I have pulled my initial investment from BTC.  This is an unviable currency.  There is a major dispute which can't be resolved.  I'm not betting *anything* on that, and have been looking for a FB for a while.  

I also consider it a complete show-stopper that BTC is now controlled from China.  It's nothing to do with racism: China is untrustworthy of any major financial instrument including BTC.  

I would only trust BTC if no nation had a majority, unless that nation was Western European, American, or had a very long record of open judicial intervention with a mature and robust regulatory structure.  China ain't it.  Not while they're building islands and claiming they own an entire ocean.  They're totally untrustworthy, and so is any currency based there or plurality-controlled there.  

BTC ETF did not go through due to a mature regulatory process and that's a sign for me as well.  

These are the issues I pay attention to which determine my long-term faith in BTC.  OP's post is 25% of my consideration right now, and it's negative and falling fast."
"Same thoughts.

I had never touched any alts because I'm a maximalist. Well, now it is crystal clear that ETH will be number 1, so my maximalism pushes me to this coin.

As many others have said already, it feels great to be part of ETH because that feeling of unstoppable innovation that was associated with Bitcoin and which disappeared has just come back with another coin.

And it is **so so** relaxing to not see fighting all day long."

"Ethereum will shine when you'll be using a smart contract and not even know it.

None of my dreams have ceased to exist, they just transfered to ethereum.

May I ask you something? If you think (And I sort of agree) that Ethereum is more of a currency than what it's selling itself as, why so many big institutions (including banks) are supporting it?

"Excellent summary. I think the difference is that Bitcoin, being currency first and maybe a platform for other things... at some point, has a different relationship to the fiat world than does Ethereum.

Bitcoin depends on the fiat economy for its value and existence. If (when) the fiat economy fails, bitcoins have no value because the world that makes things and provides services can't run on Bitcoin's computing power because that power is dedicated to hashing nonces.

The legacy economy actually *can* transition to Ethereum, and if the platform is successful then it most certainly will, just like it transitioned to the Internet over the past couple of decades.

So the value of Eth can be compared to the value of Bitcoin or fiat legacy currencies, but the more important value of Eth over time will be as a measure of the value which is actually produced on the network."
Talk about being scared from reality....
"Good, now ask why it's fighting itself. What logical reason is there for it to do that? Can't come up with any?

"Bitcoin is fighting for survival in the same way a weed seedling is fighting for survival when the Gardener casually plucks it out while tending his plants. The gardener is hardly fighting the weed at that point, it doesn't require much effort or even thought to do it. It's simply a reflexive action and part of the routine of maintaining your garden. The gardener doesn't wait to pluck out the weed until it's grown into an infestation of a plot requiring to deep plow over that plot. Why ignore upkeep and later having a lot of trouble if you can avoid it with a bit of maintenance. Right now cryptocurrencies are a hardly noticable nuisance to the establishment and it hardly costs any effort or cost to keep them in check.

You must not forget that Bitcoin is tiny, and Ethereum is even tinier, it's hardly even grown into a seedling yet, so it's far far below the notice of the gardener. But once the Bitcoin seedling is plucked out, and Ethereum starts to sprout in earnest, you know what's coming next."
The establishment is absolutely fighting against bitcoin and everything like it, but it's public and subtle so you don't recognize it.  The way bitcoin is categorized and taxed by the government prevents it from being used as a proper currency and really taking off.

Yes exactly, Metropolis will be fantastic. Raiden is like a fun but extremely powerful bonus coming soon. The treasure trove of development innovation and progress is highly refreshing... and the fact that Ethereum now really has its own network effect growing is great.

What happens when the early adopters compose of a marginal % of the actual ETH holders and they do the same kind of bail in shenanigans for something else entirely? Something not so easily defensible like preventing a hacker from taking a ton of people's money.
It could have been underway already if not for the small but vocal opposition, hellbent on obstructing bitcoin's progress.
It will bite them back eventually. It seems like not a big deal right now, but it actually is. There is an explicit guarantee right now that Bitcoin transaction is final, whether community agrees or not. There can not be such guarantee on eth, since they already rolled back history once, so it will happen again. 
Emphasis on massive
I like this thought, but I am not a believer, ETH are worth so much that any hacker isn't going to avoid it because Bitcoin has a more recognizable name....
"LOL

ETH is growing in all areas and does everything Bitcoin can do but faster and better. Ethereum transaction times are 14 seconds and Bitcoins are 10 minute + and many times to 1 hour!

For investors who look to get a good risk reward, ETH is the one not Bitcoin. Again, ETH can do everything what BTC can do, which is not much! PLUS it has smartcontract functionality which is huge, it will change the world. Bitcoin is old and to expensive, when the network effects starts to die out the new better blockchain will take over, and it's already happening! A mass exodus is starting and ETH price keeps gaining and BTC will stop going up. All the money that went into Bitcoin is now flowing into ETH.

"You are forgetting how ethereum community compromised in DAO debuckle. This will be forever on their reputation, there's no washing it clean. Ethereum will always be the chain which have ""rewritten the past"", something even core team would never think of doing.

Bitcoin is sick, and withering due to community squabbles; but luke jrs of this world would be phased out of development eventually. Unless there would be a major compromise, I don't think bitcoin will go away. It still has has power, it still has network, and it still has not compromised itself. Assholes will eventually go away"

"I'm totally pro Ethereum but those are valid questions. The Ethereum Foundation may not ""own"" a sole client implementation, but they can dictate where and when the protocol changes and most people will follow."
And it actually has leadership.  Respected leadership.
Bitcoin Unlimited removes the poisonous dictators... increases the blocksize... and provides decentralized development to ensure no new dictators arrive. Multiple teams can work on seperate but compatible clients... teams will actually rise and fall and it would be encouraged. The current Core devs... who have only really been in charge for about four years and aren't the original team whatsoever want to be Bitcoin kings forever... brainwashing the public with insane anti bitcoin ideas like users and economic majority someone are what attain consesnsus. Nakamoto consensus is about one thing... miners supporting code... 1 hash = 1 vote. That is all it has ever been yet they spew propoganda and make it seem like freaking reddit upvotes and other immeasurable things somehow impact hte network. The clearly feel entitled to their dictator power position and don't want to let go. The massive mismanagement of the code and community has caused this situation. The miners have always adjusted their blocksize... they just happened to finally hit the 1mb limit this last year and now the system is clogged. The limit should be removed and transactions allowed to flow freely and market forces do their work. It is a shame. 
How is consensus for these changes measured (maybe POS also addresses this)?  Or does the dev team have control over things?
Kinda funny nobody in this thread has mentioned Ethereum's pre-sale.
~70% of hashrate blocking SegWit soft-fork.
"> Part of Vitalik's pitch for the whole thing was 'hey, we are different, we aren't Bitcoin and don't play by those exact rules' and the community agreed like 95%.

That's all well and good, but what happens if there is a more significant difference of opinion in the Ethereum community similar to what we are currently seeing in bitcoin? I doubt the resolution would have been so quick and tidy. It still seems to me that if bitcoin cannot hardfork during this crisis and ""dies"" as a result, then the same fate awaits almost any other cryptocurrency. Ethereum has its own litany of potential governance bugbears, possibly more than bitcoin when you consider that the founder is still involved and serves as a kind of benevolent dictator.   "

Good points from a Bitcoin perspective... but the world doesn't seem to care since the business support and new fiat coming in is quite big. The ETH community really doesn't care since the majority voted for the DAO fork. Part of Vitalik's pitch for the whole thing was 'hey, we are different, we aren't Bitcoin and don't play by those exact rules' and the community agreed like 95%. So ETH isn't playing by Bitcoins rules, it is making its own and finding success anyway... which I think is cool. I don't think Bitcoin will go away either... I don't want it too... I'm just feeling it may slowly drift into a less prominent position mostly because of issues the OP stated. 
Lower than when people thought bitcoin was done for after mtgox?  I _depend_ on bitcoin now.  I buy multiple services with it and order from multiple stores with it.   At this point not using it is a far greater inconvenience than continuing to use it.  That's what is really happening. 
Its this kind of rational discussion that drives innovation and compromise! 
"I'm wondering why you think ETH is dependent on BTC? I missed the BTC train years ago, but now I'm attached to ETH, and some of the tokens that have released on it.  
  
  
As far as I know, isn't BTC a digital currency and ETH is a development platform with value? The idea of building software that runs own the eth blockchain with its own tokens as a way of currency seems like something completely different than what BTC was designed for?  
  
I don't fully understand the BTC segwit fork miners vs users situation, so I won't pretend that I do... But at a high level, is my assessment correct?

You answered it here:

The present fight is essentially about who gets to be Bitcoin. If someone would fork, change name and PoW, then any upgrade would be possible to the Ledger.  

I am looking forward to the future when PoS evolved to the point where we can do a fork of Bitcoin to some advanced EcoBitcoin type of thing. An altcoin but not an altLedger.

No, Bitcoin can fail, there's never any disputing of that, and no it's not the end of cryptos. But you know what it is the end of? Ethereum as it presently exists. They don't even have to kill Ethereum to defuse it, they can just threaten Ethereum with ""Bitcoining"" it, and you'll submit to any whim and command no matter how counter it runs to Ethereum.

Surely you realize that when crunch-time arrives for Ethereum and you're asked to submit to whims and demands that the position you'll be in to refuse is much weaker then when Bitcoin wasn't killed?

""Ethereum you have to implement address white and black listing for AML and KYC, and every user has to register his addresses with the government!""

"The oldest popular contract is the standard multisig wallet in Mist, which has m-of-n transactions and a daily spending limit for any single address. A recent variation puts a delay on spends by single keys; the bigger the spend, the longer the delay, so other keys have more time to cancel. Lots of people use these to secure their funds.

I would say Kickstarter-style fundraising and token sales are valid uses too; they're prominent right now because we're still in a fairly early phase of Ethereum's history. All that's working extremely well.

There are several gambling contracts in production...similar to SatoshiDice except with fancier games and good UI, and without necessarily having to trust the operator to provide fair randomness.

Lots more is coming this year, but that's what's available right now, off the top of my head.

Ethereum started with multiple client implementations from the beginning.. this is a huge difference. There's no 'official' one.
That is what they claim. There is no proof but their own word. They rebranded mere days after the instamine. And that is really only one of the red flags that surround it.
You could at least link to them then, if you expect anyone to trawl through your comments to prove your own point you are mistaken. 
It's easy to blame others. Both sides are to blame in the end.
1 hash = 1 vote is the only voting mechanism Bitcoin has ever had. There is no 'Economic Majority and Censored Reddit Sub Upvote Algorithm' inherent to Bitcoins design. Bitcoin cannot detect what Core supporters and it appears you are claiming it can detect. Bitcoin was designed to overcome issues like this through Nakamoto Consensus... which is miners using their votes. The devs who usurped the Core name three years ago have been doing a really great job at convincing a portion of the community that somehow immeasurable and easily manipulated things like 'users and economic majority' somehow have an impact on Bitcoins consensus system... they don't. If you don't like that fact you never should have been involved with Bitcoin to begin with. Other cryptos have built in user voting systems if you want that.

"Core is trying to centralize bitcoin, the users are decentralizing by no longer limiting themselves to a single coin.

>  Bitcoin was making continual progress and the community was unified. Compare the situation back then to day. We have now had 2 years of stagnation, and in many cases degradation of the network.      
      
It's funny that it seems bitcoin stagnated and became stale the exact moment blockstream came into power.      
    
>No, this is Core’s fault by making a hard fork dangerous by telling everyone a hard fork is dangerous for the past two years and blocking every conceivable compromise.     
    
Exactly, sticking your heels in the ground screaming hardforks are dangerous and repeating it is a self-fulfilling prophecy.    
The only reason a hardfork is even contentious in the first place is because Core made sure they were. If core just did as satoshi suggested in 2010, there would be no problem, and bitcoin would still have at least 85% market share. (probably even 90%+)     
    
> They have petrified the bitcoin community and convinced them that any kind of hard fork for any reason that does not come from them is dangerous. They have done this to hold onto the power they should not even have in the first place. They have become the self appointed kings of bitcoin.

They are the de-facto dictators of bitcoin, and everyone here in /r/btc knows it. And somehow they are still able to convince a large group of people that roger ver/jihan wu are the enemies. I am stunned that their propaganda is so effective.     
      
> here will likely be people who say “but Ethereum doesn’t have any uses cases”,     
     
I have long held off from buying ETH because it's not a currency. I have never claimed it doesn't have any use cases, it does. But it's not a currency and will never be one. I hold some ETH now, just because of the fact that besides Dash there is no alternative for bitcoin *as a currency*. That doesn't mean ETH doesn't have any use cases. It's just different."

Haha, good one. And you think the darknet won't happily move to Ethereum just the same... What planet do you live on exactly? Is it the same one where the other week some cyber criminals wanted payment in Ethereum for that Apple hack? Cause if that's the same planet... idk what rock you live under.

> But the things you're dealing with now, this is not from the outside. This is Bitcoin eating itself alive. You see that right?

Yes I see that Bitcoin is apparently tearing itself apart from the inside. But when something like that happens, do you just go ""oh okay, whatever."" or do you ask ""why?"". Because if you don't ask ""why?"" how can you be sure Ethereum won't do that to itself? You can't, you don't know the reason, you haven't even started reasoning about the reason, yet you simply assume that a slightly different flavor protects you from everything. How naive are you really?

Why is bitcoin tearing itself apart, because apparently, for motives we can only deduce, people in power have chosen to run it into the ground. How did those people get into power? They slowly accumulated and consolidated it with the help of some Banks and the financial elite. Why would companies apparently invest money into something only to intentionally run their investment into the ground? Well why indeed, that seems fairly not greedy and not rational. You can only conclude that when people act against their better judgement to the detriment of their wealth, that they have an ulterior motive. And if that's so, well, then Ethereum is as screwed as Bitcoin once bitcoin stops being worth the bother for the immune system."

"This is *exactly* why cryptocurrency will *never* be a sustainably stable form of currency unless a major economic state power adopts it. (Which will never happen because that means loss of control over printing.)

**The notion that cryptocurrency is a limited resource is a myth**.

Any given implementation may, in fact, be limited, but the fact that there are mathematically *unlimited* numbers of possible algorithms and protocols to establish such a currency means that **cryptocurrency is fiat, not intrinsic.**

As one reaches its prime, the miners will migrate to the ""next big thing"" in order to validate reasonable returns, and as that bubble blows up, the users will migrate and invest. And when that reaches the prime, the miners will move on and the cycle will continue.

Without forceful adoption by a strong nation state, *no* cryptocurrency can be sustained indefinitely. This is, unfortunately, not much more than a de facto pyramid scheme, unbeknownst to even the pioneers. It requires no ill intent to undermine any given cryptocurrency as the bubbles blow up and pop, time and again. But they *will* each fail as everyone moves on to the next big thing.

People who are making financial decisions based on emotions seldom reach success. Going all in or out of something is not logical in my opinion when there is high uncertainty involved.

Lastly, the fact that you could move majority of your holdings out, means that you never really used BTC outside of speculation.

Either way good luck, but don't be surprised when it turns out that no altcoin is resillient against the 'attack of retards'"

As it is, very rarely do 'known names' (e.g. leaders in the space) post under their own name because the Core/r/bitcoin trolls gravitate towards them like crazy (as you well know)."
"This looks like a good contrarian indicator.

The nature of Bitcoin's binary bet is that the next stage of success involves at least an order of magnitude more investment than all that came before. Even if half the current investors dumped BTC after a fork to bigger blocks, there are 10x as many investors waiting to jump in. 

Besides, in fork trading most of those eager to dump will be keeping their small block BTC, allowing us big blockers to dump the small block BTC on them at a premium. We actually make *more* money in this process, by forking. So this is indeed just another case of someone calling Bitcoin dead because of not understanding.

Ethereum has its Gavin now, but is he going to be able to resist what happened to Bitcoin's Gavin? And if he does, it's even more hazardous. The move to full [Market Governance](https://bitcoindebates.miraheze.org/wiki/Market_Governance_FAQ) is always a rocky one, but Bitcoin is furthest along by far.

Most realistically, I just did my monthly googling to find out if the dark markets - one of the only places in crypto where real brass-tacks commerce happens - are complaining about high fees, backlogs, and switching to altcoins. Result? 

- very few complaints about high fees

- quite a few ""why no confirmation yet"" posts but universally answered with ""just bump the fee"" and then ""thanks guys, that solved it"" 

- negligible use of any altcoins by vendors or buyers - despite much-hyped incorporation of a few of them in by the markets

Clearly the network effect is much stronger than 50-cent or even dollar fees for these guys, and although the situation is getting very worrying it is exactly now that the miners are mobilizing. That makes it odd timing to leave. 

Your mention of all these devs tinkering in Ethereum makes me think you really haven't understood. Sound money is THE use case. It blows everything else out of the water, and it *already works.* The blocksize cap is the only thing standing in Bitcoin's way for the next couple orders of magnitude in adoption and price, and it is about to fall. Smart contracts and DAOs are neat but we shouldn't so easily forget that Bitcoin is a historic invention and just throwing random spaghetti at the wall a hundred times isn't going to automatically work to create another revolution. 

Devs gotta dev is what got Bitcoin into this mess; I don't think it's going to help Ethereum, especially with investors who approve of ledger edits and after seeing how incresibly much harder smart contracts were than they all thought, having been busted out of that utopian daze, they still doubled the price from where it was when ill-fated TheDAO drove it all the way up to $20+. 

Finally, and this is inflammatory but I have to mention it, when I spent some time on the Ethereum subreddits last summer I found the average level of intelligence and economic understanding to be far lower than in the Bitcoin subs, as well as a fetish for pie-in-the-sky schemes with little critical examination (I know I know, bitcoiners love their LN vapor mesh network fantasies, but I'm talking even worse than that). Not that there aren't very smart people in Ethereum, but the average is very worrying - these investors are not going to be strong hands. Don't say I didn't warn you."

"Fantastic post that really sums up the situation and my personal thoughts very well. Yes it will never fully die... just become Myspace and limp along. The infighting is too much... Core's hubris and rock bottom social intelligence has destroyed this community along with massive help from Theymos. In an effort to ban all discussion about 'altcoins' and crush discussion of long planned block size increase Theymos effectively created market demand and ensured that the alts would rise... by destroying the Bitcoin community. I see a strong possibility of Ethereum becoming the Facebook and I too was around in 2011! And way back then I told my wife 'if this gets Myspaced eventually we will move to the Facebook'

I can completely understand where you're coming from. I've always dismissed other crypto currencies as a distraction, and always believed that Bitcoin will remain the leading crypto because it was never really in danger of losing this position. However, things have changed drastically, as there is real competition now. I firmly believe that Ethereum's market cap will surpass Bitcoin's cap this year - which won't mean that 1 ETH will be worth more than 1 BTC because there are simply more ETH in circulation, but I think we will get to that point in time as well.

Bitcoin's do or die period is nearing its end, companies and whales are making the switch bit by bit. I also believe that there will be no resolution to this scaling debate, ever. Both parties will hold their position, neither SW nor BU are going to be activated, and Bitcoin will slowly fade into obscurity. Bitcoin's technical development aside, I would also like to add toxicity to the list of things that slowly drive me away from Bitcoin. I'm tired of putting up with a Nazi-esque regime that controls the most popular information hubs and censors any opinion they do not appreciate. All of these smear campaigns, FUD, censorship, trolling and banning of people speaking up against Blockstream's narrative is just too annoying. I believe a lot of people are now actively embracing any alternative that might be a worthy successor to Bitcoin due to those reasons.

"That's quite the manifesto.

First, sorry to see you go. If you honestly believe what you wrote here then no one can blame you for not sticking around. If you think that bitcoin's failure is a foregone conclusion (or at least close enough to a 100% probability event), then it is no one's place to make you stick around.

That said, your scenarios seem awfully detailed and drawn out for a system that is as complex as bitcoin, with many assumptions scattered here and there. I'm not saying you're not entitled to a few assumptions when trying to predict the future, but if you include too many, they add up exponentially until the probability of your forecast coming true drops down to pretty much negligible territory.

I'm not saying that we shouldn't think about the future, but maybe it's more useful to discuss the future in more general terms without making too many assumptions.

Since some people might be curious, as an example here is a list of questionable assumptions included in Scenario 1:

>Core and their supporters will start to try and burn down the network.

How do you know? I have noticed a trickle of new faces here over the last week as the Core narrative has begun to unravel. For all we know, EC getting 75% of the hashrate might result in significant user attrition over at /r/bitcoin as people realize ""holy shit /r/btc was right."" Sure you might have a few hardcore holdouts, but I don't think there will necessarily be enough of them to precipitate the scenario you describe regarding the price. For every pissed of bitcoin baron in the Core camp, you will also have people with deep pockets who understand EC who will support the price with buying activity. In fact I personally hope that there is a dump of fresh bitcoin by core holdouts so that there is a final and definitive wealth transfer from bad actors to good actors.

>After the fork happens the price could go down to literally any level.

Again, how do you know? Even in the worst case scenario of a holdout minority chain, in this scenario the EC miners have a supermajority and they can disrupt the competing chain, forcing a PoW change. Of course, a PoW change will mean that the minoity chain no longer has any of the massive hashing power of the majority bitcoin network, which also leaves them open to attack. At the same time. Neutral investors will absolutely punish the price of the minority chain if their security is poor, which it will be.

>While this is happening, the Ethereum market cap is going to overtake bitcoin even if the Ethereum price does not increase (which it will).

Possible, but how can you be sure? There's no denying that Ethereum and all the other alts are looking a bit bubbly these days. How can you be sure that Ethereum will be within striking distance of bitcoin?     

Anyway, good luck with your future endeavors. I sincerely hope we see you here again some time in the future.

"I would really profit from your scenario as I hold significantly more eth than btc. I still somehow have an ""emotional"" connection to bitcoin and would like it to become the worlds dominant crypto currency. That's why times are pretty stressful for me right now. Sometimes I ask myself why I even care. Why do I freak out when I see the ignorance and arogance over at /r/bitcoin I could just profit from them being wrong..

Anyway.. was good to have you here and see you over there :)"
"I'd give gold to whoever created that bot. I hope it spams the shit out of reddit subs far and wide ;p They also need you're bot, they're bot, we're bot, etc..."
Yup.  Bitcoin is driving itself off a cliff.
"very good analysis. agree in most of the points. also given my very best to help saving bitcoin. but yes, it all seems now hopeless to me, even if bu prevail, the throne of bitcoin is gone, it's only a matter of time. i think i'm going to sell last portion of btc, unsubscribe from here (been banned long ago from /r/ bitcoin), and put my energy into promising things. we should watch out carefully same things do not happen to other cryptos, current fiat elite has really shown power to dismantle dangerous disruptive projects like bitcoin was. next targets are ethereum and monero. stay strong. it's all big politics, ""Bilderberg for idiots"" is one needed book these days to be the best seller."

"> I think bitcoin is past the point of no return.
> I’m out. Ethereum is likely to take over this year as bitcoin becomes myspace. This may happen very rapidly. I hope I am wrong.

You're concluding that Bitcoin losing the fight against Ethereum is like MySpace losing the fight against Facebook. This is not the case. Bitcoin would be losing the fight against the status quo and the establishment. And after the establishment is done with Bitcoin, Ethereum is next. All your good intentions, well setup governance, holding hands and singing kumbaya will not save you from coming under the same attack that Bitcoin is under, and it will shred Ethereum to pieces much quicker.

What you're actually looking at is like what would have happened if both MySpace and Facebook where fighting for their survival if the traditional media had a lobby back then that was strong enough to get anti-social-network laws passed, and facebook celebrated taking out MySpace which was the only thing keeping the lobby mob off their backs. Facebook would not have done well."

"This is why core will win. They will have the economic majority, because everyone with any sense has/will leave the bitcoin community.

I totally empathize with you, and now have more ethereum than bitcoin. I haven't given up completely on bitcoin, though."
"I've already moved into ETH and related projects as well, I think you are absolutely right.

Even at 75% there is no guarantee that miners will figure this out. That isn't an activation threshold, just a target optimal for a hard fork. Actually getting miners to do it successfully, to decide what size to increase blocks to amongst them, will be nearly impossible. As you say, Core devs and supporters will double up on clouding everything, which means we are still probably months and months from an end if at all. It seems like miners are more divided on this than ever after what I just read here today.

EThs approach is quite novel, moving to PoS soon to eliminate this from happening there, *ever*, but still has some PoW properties in the way it calculates network resource usage to execute a contract. 

Meanwhile, I see demos like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6-rf68taTs) from months ago actually showing what Ethereum can do with some imagination. No use cases? Ethereum is capable of *every* use case, including Bitcoin's job as basic currency. That might just go to Zcash once zkSnarks integration with Ethereum happens this summer. 

I'll see you there friend, anything else is just moving deck chairs on the Titanic. It is time to accept that Bitcoin was a revolutionary prototype in it's day who's time as come, that inspired 100s of developers to think big and develop their own blockchain protocols, and inspired 1000's of people who see the greater vision in a bankless, centerless world. Bitcoin did the job it needed to do, and it is time to say goodbye now. "
I see what you mean.
"More conspiracy theories about ""them"" out to get bitcoin.  You're describing a carefully articulated plot of sabotage, not an immune response.

Like another poster noted, it's just tribalism.  Not conspiracy."
Sorry to see you go, but my question is: I see a number of moderators listed, but are they actually doing any moderation? I don't see the large volumes of anti-/r//Bitcoin spam being filtered in any way. What's the point of a bitcoin subreddit in which the only thing being discussed is another bitcoin subreddit? We all know that /r//Bitcoin is censored. Do we need to be repeatedly told that daily to the exclusion of everything else?
Paging bitcoinobituaries.com
Welcome to Ethereum!  I know the community is happy to have you!
no hate good move :) eth is strong 
I am stepping down as a member of r/btc and exiting the bitcoin communauty and entering the Ethereum community.
Well. If I had to sum up the end result here, I would say that the government Intel agencies/the hidden hand whose been meddling and disturbing the organic growth of botcoin, due to it being a threat to the establishment, has been effectively neutralized. We all watched it happen in real time as provocateurs successfully derailed our entire movement. Pissed me off that many people couldn't see it happening right in front of their eyes! 
excellent. WOW
Goodbye, good luck.
But Core also had a roadmap... And then they didn't honor it.

"Why I invest in Dash?

Ethereum is great. It's a programmable block chain with lots of level 2 projects, Raiden, Augur, StorJ, etc... I hold some Ethereum, but Dash is my biggest position nowadays.

I feel that Dash is much simpler to use and more focused to be Money.

1. Instant transactions (InstantSend). About 2 seconds in Dash vs 17 sec in Ethereum is very important for retail brick-n-mortar shops. Compared to 10 min in Bitcoin on it's best-day.

2. Dash Masternode Voting - governance mechanism, similar to shareholder voting in traditional corporations.

3. Incentivized Masternodes. - even if our block chain will grow huge, it's incentivized to buy new hardware to keep up with demand.

4. Dash network can pay it's own expenses right of the block chain and even sponsor an advertisement campaign from it's block chain rewards. Bitcoin and Ethereum never had anything like it. Put it simply, the economic model of Dash is superior. For example we will vote with our Masternodes for Charlie Shrem's Dash Mastercard, and he will get paid by the Dash network for his start-up business.
https://www.dashcentral.org/p/DASHPAYCARD-DEBIT-CARD

4. Dash is a drop-in replacement for Bitcoin, while Ethereum has a learning curve. It means that it's easier to adopt for merchants, that already accepts Bitcoin. Dash wallets are simpler to use.

5. I think Ethereum could become the Linux of crypto-currencies. Scalable, programmable, powerful and open, but hard to use. Especially if you want some advanced features. Very few people can take advantage of the Linux system, as compared to Windows. Same here: very few people will have the technical skills to take advantage of Ethereum's programmability, while Dash stays much simpler for day-to-day use.

6. Biggest reason by far: Bitcoin is broken. My transactions take between 3 hours up to 26 hours to confirm, when a year ago I used to confirm in 10 minutes . Bitcoin used to provide me a service, but now it provides me a dis-service. I have sold most of my Bitcoins for Dash.

Disclaimer: I own both Dash and Ethereum, but proportionally much more capital in Dash. I used to hold lots of Bitcoin until 2017.

-""Technologov""."
"You're right in a fashion, but sadly uninformed. For Bitcoin, this is an epic fight for survival in the same way that for a bacteria it's an epic fight for survival to be attacked by the immune system. For the body, it's hardly any calories worth mentioning spent and not even an elevated temperature.

Society is a self-perpetuating pattern, and that pattern is carefully cultivated like a garden by those gaining the most of it (and that's not the plants and insects living in it). A gardner casually plucks out any weed seedling that sprouts as a matter of habitual upkeep, it's not a fight for the gardener at that point, but it is, for the seedling. But for the Gardner it's a lot better than having to uproot and deep plow a plot once a weed infestation has taken root.

Why spend a lot of effort fighting something if you can pluck it out before it has set in roots?

That's how the establishment works, and it's how it patterns society to work. Most are unwitting cells in the great body that is society, and you act on the rules and conventions set forth by its carefully bred genetic code. Cryptocurrencies challange that, and no matter how small the challenge, there will be an immune response, and that immune response will be proportional, meaning that at every stage, it's a fight for survival. Your body doesn't ignore a microbe it doesn't like just because it's not worth killing by itself. It attacks that microbe because it can't allow it to multiply and do real harm.

It's a mystery to me how you people don't realize that. How you're conditioned to ridicule the very real attack on Bitcoin as a coincidence. How you seem to be abjectly blind that Bitcoin is indeed being attacked, and that it's in the process of dying because of that attack, and that the other microbes should be getting quite nervous around at that point...

How do you think your negotiating position in Ethereum is when Bitcoin gets wiped out this way?

""Ethereum you have to implement address registering of all users and all users have to hand over their private keys so we can do KYC and AML"". 

* Bitcoin is dead: ""oh mkay (._.), please don't Bitcoin us.""
* Bitcoin is still alive: ""Screw you, Bitcoin is still around and kicking after you tried to kill it, we're not afraid of you.""

Good luck, good luck indeed in your ""glorious"" Ethereum future when your dear leader will break the bad news, but it'll actually be good news (tm)  (but no, not really, it'll be really really bad)."
Really? Do you have any numbers on their actual usage? Where are the local markets like lbc for those two? I bet those currencies are accepted  a only because they are so easily converted to bitcoin. And again, once those currencies reached the size of Bitcoin they would have the same issues, given they are based on the same core principles. Are we supposed to just switch currencies every time there is a disagreement, or does Nakamoto consensus work?        
"Come to the Ethereum community! 

We'll gladly take you in."
Hear hear
What's coming next?
Yes, I used to make that argument myself.  I no longer buy the argument anymore.  Check your ego, bitcoin can fail and have it not be the end of the world for crypto.
"Great! Hope you all BU supporters will leave for 'better options' so Bitcoin can continue with its progress.

Funny how you have blocked progress of network and now you are leaving Bitcoin for that very same problem you have created. :D"
"...because why?  There's nothing magical about bitcoin.  It's just an implementation of a technological advance.

The first airplane was an uncomfortable, unsafe deathtrap.  Does that mean that everybody stopped flying?  The first car only went 5 miles an hour.   Did we give up on that?

The first iteration of a technology does not need to succeed for the technology to succeed."
">bitcoin is actively losing allies

This is demonstrably false. Bitcoin is gaining allies and this is measurable by the massive price increase we've enjoyed over the past year and a half. "

Weak hands it's called. 
Probably. Like the many zombie coins out there. It will take years to get there most likely.
"Logic is not needed to explain human behavior.  Greed, lust for power, religious fervor.  These are what is killing Bitcoin.  The folks at Core want to control bitcoin and are apparently willing to do harm to the ecosystem to maintain that control.  Miners are more interested in maintaining short-term profit than taking a small loss so that the system as a whole can be healed.

Ethereum isn't fighting itself, so I'm not sure what you're getting at there."
"If you could bring the rest of this sub with you,

"I going to start keeping a list of reddit users that rage quit over this.

I can't wait to contact you all in a year or two, when we have segwit/LN, larger blocks, schnorr sigs, and we're at 10 times the price.

This altcoin pump will crash hard once segwit is activated."
It seems so. I have done the same but moved to Dash instead of Ethereum. If Bitcoin had no blocksize limit from the start it could of been a diffrent story.
If you believe the scenarios likely, you essentially believe that Ethereum will befall the same fate as Bitcoin, except faster and more vile.
I disagree with the assessment that Bitcoin can't survive a fork, but if it can't then I suppose it doesn't deserve to live. However I feel that once we fork to a working model of Bitcoin that the utility we once knew will return and that we can rally.
"Then a database with API's 

The idea of the block chain is that its supposed to be trustless, it cannot be trustless if it is centralized and you transactions are not sovereign as in someone can censor or confiscate them. 

if its centralized youd need to TRUST whoemever holds the power. "

"Bitcoin was once going to be where ETH is going. For some ""strange"" reason it didn't. You have to be an extraordinary fool to believe that that is coincidence. And if it you don't think it's coincidence (and I don't), you have to start asking the question of why it was done, and what will those with the power to destroy Bitcoin, destroy next. Who's a smart cookie and can guess what it is I wonder..."
You know, the usual, make a community fight itself and tear itself apart, lies, deceit, divide and conquer, that sort of thing. I thought this was fairly obvious...
Just a reminder that this guy is not representative of the Ethereum community. The reality is obviously a bit more nuanced.
"Yes OK, but who?

Edit: Unless you mean that some banks are totally pro-fiat and some banks are totally against it."
Please keep your censorship out of the Ethereum community.

and yet the price rises.  lmao you guys are losers
"Your characterization of bitcoin being money and ethereum being a dev platform is approximately right. Unfortunately, it's also irrelevant.

Ethereum is also money, and in an attempt not to draw the ire of the establishment, Ethereum tries very very hard to downplay that aspect. It is however not fooling anybody, Ethereum is still a cryptocurrency.

Cryptocurrencies challenge a status quo, and that status quo is fiat currency. Our world is built from top to bottom on fiat currency. It's been moderately popular in the past, but the last 100 years was the age of fiat currency. Fiat currency is attractive to those in power because it's debt based (so it allows endless rent-seeking) and it can be used by state actors to finance their deficit spending as well as assert dominance over each other.

We are however in the end-stages of the age of fiat, as we have been living under a strange regime of negative interest rates (you get punished for saving up), ballooning personal debt and a sequence of boom&busts the last one or two decades. This isn't brought on per-se by the age of fiat (though it could be argued it's a natural consequence of a debt based system). But it is certainly brought on by the prevailing economic doctrine, that is Keynesianism (altough todays Keynesians take Keynesianism to extremes that would make Keynes rotate in his grave, but I digress). In an ironic twist of fate, Kynes formulated his doctrine as a response to the cycles of booms&busts that where perceived to be brought on by using a deflationary currency (they where in fact brought on by irresponsible bankers, deficit spending and irresponsible lending).

At its core the entire fiat/keynesianism/debt construct is designed to consolidate power in the hands of the few while maintaining the illusion of democracy and comfortable living for the many.

And that is what cryptocurrencies essentially challenge. They challenge 100 years of economic doctrine, state power over money and all the power that got consolidated by these mechanisms in the last 100 years. That's what everybody, Bitcoin, Etherum etc. is up against.

The competition that Bitcoin has with Etherum in this context simply doesn't matter. It doesn't even register on the radar.

What has been done to Bitcoin hasn not been done to it by Ethereum. But something was done to Bitcoin, I mean, we are in pretty serious deep shit. By all indications, it was done to Bitcoin by itself, but that makes very little logical sense. So you have to ask: Who was doing the doing, and who expects to benefit from it? And the answer isn't ""Etherum"". And if it isn't ""Ethereum"" then the conclusion is that Ethereum only exists relatively unmolested because those doing the doing (of destroying Bitcoin) simply don't (yet) care about Ethereum. And now you know why I'm worried about Ethereum when Bitcoin goes bust. Because those doing the destroying of Bitcoin haven't gone anywhere, they're still there, still challenged, and now fresh out of a focus of their attention."
Weren't you an anti-Bitcoiners all the time? I am sure you will be the same in the future.
"Good luck!


PS: All big blockers and Ethereum lovers should take a look at this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RifULbnGD-0"
And here we have another buy signal! :)
If you want to save your bitcoin value, convert all to ethereum and when the hard fork happens, wait a while and, it the currency does not die, convert back to bitcoin.
"Diversity is a great thing, I've done it myself and has raised a huge weight off my shoulders, theres no shame in that at all so I don't really understand why you think it's necessary to jump ship (especially to ethereum of all things).

I get that you want to inform people you're moving on but I don't think this is the right way.

I'm sorry you're hanging up the mod hat so quickly and hope you'll stick around as I'm not so doom and gloomy as you are right now, in fact I'm kinda reassured that Bitcoin has a future with the miners finally moving forward with a sustainable and, dare I say it, sensible scaling solution."
Why etherum and not dash or monero? Because of cloud contracts?
Goodbye and for the love of god anyone else that doesn't believe or is uncertain in Bitcoin please quit !!! Goodbye!
who cares?
"Thanks for this great post.  
I'm out of bitcoin myself for these exact same reasons.
One thing that I find sad is that almost everyone on the crypto subreddits is pumping something.  If you listen to this guy, it's Ethereum, if you listen to another it's BU, another is Segwit, another is Monero or even Dash.

This makes a very bad space for innovation, since no one seems to be able to develop and wait/participate and everyone is in there for their quick buck or long term holdings that would mimic the early adopters in bitcoin gains. The gains made back then at sub 3$ are not possible to repeat. Simple as that. We get scams, morons, pumpers and other sorts of behaviour, comparable to the end of the 90s tech bubble.

There's too much greed and too little real innovation. Getting the bitcoin network to as 5$ for a transaction of 500$ and let the user wait for 2-8 hours is a shame, and the people who let this happen are the same ones telling you they have the magic solution. Like a virus making, anti-virus company. Innovation in payments will be made.
  
Performant network <> freedom/anonymity <> affordable price for participation (tx) <> payment solution  <> store of value  <> decentralisation <> security 
  
Are all factors that are all influencing each other.  But we will never have all of it. Not in bitcoin, not in any other crypto."
Fair enough...
"> How do you see ethereum overcoming these issues when they arise?

Two solutions, both which are planned to be implemented. 

First is sharding, which splits network across a number of different nodes.

Second is Raiden, which is basically the Lightning Network. 
"
"You're imagining some kind of shadow war against Bitcoin that's to blame for its ills, but this is only in your mind.  The establishment never moved to crush bitcoin or make it illegal.  It did something far worse - it ignored bitcoin.

And who can blame them really?  The whole cryptoanarchist aesthetic wasn't really business-friendly.  And the silk road was unsavory.  

But the things you're dealing with now, this is not from the outside.  This is Bitcoin eating itself alive.  You see that right?"
When that disagreement drags on for years, divides the community and causes complete stagnation during that time while the competitor innovates: yes. There's only so much people are willing to put up with. Years are centuries in tech.
Basically rThe_donald for cryptocurrencies.
I have been into Ethereum since 2015 and crypto in general since 2013. Went out when DAO happened and strongly opposed the hard fork. But development continued and the bear cycle naturally ended, while Bitcoin just continued its stagnation of years. Tech that completely stalls for so long is dead tech.
[deleted]
"What you want out of a cryptocurrency, citing actions such as the Ethereum hard fork to stop the as-written execution of the DAO script and the central leadership of a founder, is the antithesis of a network whose primary property is trust. That's not a statement of ideology, but of computer science. Non-authoritative trust as a network property doesn't yet exist as an absolute state, and Bitcoin is overwhelmingly the closest we have graduated towards that state.

We want mutually incompatible things out of Bitcoin. I'm sorry you're unable to see the value in a trust network like Bitcoin. I'm however glad that there are services that do provide the feature set you are looking for which you can migrate to. There is no other blockchain displaying the properties of trust via decentralized security model the way Bitcoin is currently - I don't have the option to just pick another horse at this time the way you do to follow my desired protocol properties.

Good luck wherever you land and there's always room for you to come back."
What is network effect?
The most important thing is that the people have a way to transact when the banks fail and the fiat currencies start to melt away. If bitcoin doesn't raise the blocksize limit, then Ethereum will become the people's money using things like the Raiden network. 
What an idiot.  See ya!!
Have fun holding your rollback coin.
thanks for making it official that this sub exists to attack Bitcoin and shill altcoins for money
"Banks are all pro fiat/debt. Everything they do is repackage debt and manage debt and get paid for debt every step of the way. Banks are the vessel the establishment uses to get around, and they don't use Banks like you or I do.

You see the problem of cryptocurrencies is: You can't confiscate it like gold, because it's not a physical thing. You can't control them like a real world currency because it has no central issuer. And there's no telling what economic/monetary ""crazy-talk"" its users might get up to. You can see how the establishments immune system would have a mild reaction to them by default. But what is a mild immune reaction to the body, is a fight for survival to the bacteria."
"I don't think there's anything that shields you from being attacked. People are always corruptible and communities can always be made to tear themselves apart.

The big experiment that Satoshi started isn't if Bitcoin can make it. It's if cryptocurrencies can make it. And I don't think the future of cryptocurrencies looks very bright if the first of its breed proves that they can't."
"Would they though?  Most people just dismiss such claims as being delusions of conspiracy nutjobs.  Even if they do read, they don't do their own research to verify the accuracy of the claims and thus still don't really take them seriously.  

And then there are those that want to believe it, and go along with the whole thing without doing their homework either, and they further taint the credibility of the claims because they don't really know that much.  

That's why I recommend people do their own research.  The research of others can be a useful starting point though.  [This](https://forum.bitcoin.com/post32869.html) could be a start point for you, if down the rabbit hole you choose to go. "
who cares, at the end of the day everyone sells for dollars to actually buy things .
So you think Ethereum is going to be better and easier?? Its completely centralized by Vitalik and company.  They are basically central bankers.  You are leaving Bitcoin to work at a central bank.
D.. Did you just say bitcoin will die (again)?
"TL;DR

Bitcoin whale becomes stealth Ether whale, goes over to BU for 6 months to damage Bitcoin, makes his exit :p

As somone who leans for Core and wants SW/LN, I agree with him very closely on scenarios 1 and 2, and although my thoughts on #3 are a bit different they likely lead to the same outcome. His essay is thoughtful and will hopefully lead to some constructive changes in the bitcoin space before it is too late. (I still hold some BTC, but I've been moving the same direction he has for these reasons.)
