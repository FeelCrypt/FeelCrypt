"I did read it in its full context, who ends a conversation by saying you don't know you are wrong because you don't know what I know and I can't tel you for secret reasons?

I just posted here because I'm not allowed to post there."
"u/MrRGnome  not to take any offense at your edit in the statement linked below about r/btc being full of trolls, they are free to comment here but unfortunately many of them are fundamentally aligned with BS/Core. 

all critical voices have been banned from r/bitcoin and many other bitcoin discussion channels.

I just wanted to point out that u/nullc ending a rational convention like he did is observed!

Sure he is aware of evidence that bitcoin is under attack and sure there will be unpleasant consequences if he breaks his contrast. For what I can tell its could very well be Blockstream who is attacking bitcoin. "
"It's not that r/btc is full of trolls, but it does have more than a few hot tempered ""evangelists"" with more ambition than common sense. Some of them I imagine just monitor nullc's user page to pick apart every word he says for posting material. I made the edit because I could see people taking the conversation the wrong way, so please try to take it in its full context."
For being a useless troll.
