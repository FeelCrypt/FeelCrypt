"There are merchs and sellers already selling their products and services accepting BCH. [Look at this list](https://www.coinpoint.net/infographics/bch-merchants/). This has been useful. I actually subscribed to RocketResponder and got some cool stuff from MusicPlay. Other stuff like training bootcamp, limo service in the list. Hope this helps.
