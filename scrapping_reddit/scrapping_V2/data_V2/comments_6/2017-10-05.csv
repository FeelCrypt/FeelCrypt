Wait, since block values decrease by half every 4 years, and mining difficulty is increasing (and also as more people use Bitcoin) doesn't that mean in a few years, when miners don't earn much from mining, won't they either start charging much higher transaction fees or stop mining? If they're making less and less then what will be their incentive to keep mining in 20 years other than really high transaction fees? 
"Transaction speed depends on how many transactions are waiting in line to get through the bottleneck. Unlike a ""fair"" line, you can waive a $5 bill in the air to get bumped to the front. Speeding things up for everyone requires a change in the way the system works, like making the line wider (increasing the block size).

> So the fees are a kind of deterrent against attacks?

That's definitely one function they serve."
"Miners don't set fees, so that's the nice part. Users tack fees on as an extra ""tip"" to incentivize the miner to include their transaction in the next block solved.

And yes, eventually the reward for a solved block will fall below the cost in electricity it takes to solve the block. By that point, a larger user base and MANY more transactions per block will incentivize miners to keep the network going. At least that's the plan.

Also we have these things called difficulty adjustments that are built into Bitcoin Cash. Not sure exactly how it works, but I've read community consensus can change how difficult blocks are to solve. Right now with 60+ Cash blocks being solved per hour, people are clamoring to make the difficulty level higher."
"Okay that makes sense.

So the simplest solution is to (eventually) increase the block size

I just don't understand how the difficulty adjustments affect any of this?"
Remember that number from the video, the one that had to start with a certain number of zeroes? How many zeroes affects how long it takes to guess and check before finding the right SHA-256 hash. Blocks need to be solved fast, but not too fast, and they need to have enough transactions in them to push traffic through even during peak times. The difficulty adjustment helps them get solved faster (or slower), and the block size helps include more transactions per block solved.
Okay so the difficulty is used to make sure miners aren't solving a block before it's full (or mostly full) by making it take longer to solve so more transactions can be made while that happens
"I wouldn't say close to full. A full block would ideally be reached only at Black Friday-level capacity. Or in other words, perfect-world scenario is the block (however big it is) can hold just a little over the maximum volume of transactions we can expect in the time it takes to solve a block.

You can see how coding software to make this happen is some tricky business!"
"Okay that makes sense

Anyway, i was just thinking about those ""second-level"" something (what's it called again?) you were talking about earlier. So basically those are a way of optimizing block usage by turning 5 transactions (A>B>C>D>E>F) into one (A>F) so one block can essentially have way more (individual) transactions without *actually* having more transactions. Is that right? "
Second-layer solutions. And yes, you've got the basic gist!
"Nice. Thanks for explaining all that. Even though there's still a bunch i probably don't know i feel like i know everything i need to know about Bitcoin to understand how it works. I'll let you know if i have any more questions, but for now i can't think of any.

Thanks"

"> Question everything =] 

Why?"
"So the fees are a kind of deterrent against attacks?

And why can't they just make it faster (ie 1 minute instead of 10)"
You're missing the reason Bitcoin's creator installed the 1mb block limit in the first place. When transactions were nearly free, someone could spam tons of bogus transactions and forever clog up the blockchain with gigabytes of trash data. While a similar attack would be extremely expensive under today's fee market, larger blocks will bring down fees and reduce transaction times. That means it's cheaper to attack the network, so it becomes a balancing act.
Thanks this helps a lot (and yeah I'll watch that video now) but what is a node?
"Can't we just make a one extra-hard fork into waaay bigger blocks than we need yet?

Then we'd only need to fork once and if we do it soon enough there won't be as many people who have to switch, and as the Bitcoin community grows (which it would be able to do much quicker), the number of people still on the old, dead fork becomes negligible compared to the new soccer of the bigger fork.

Or am I missing something?"
They keep the full history of transactions and facilitate, uh ... something. I'm not entirely sure how they differ from regular network nodes. Still learning!
You have to hard fork every time you do it. Hard forks can be contentious and cause issues, and always split the community. Ideally 99% of the community jumps on one fork and leaves the rest behind to die, but that's not always the case.
What's wrong with upping the block size?
"This thread is a month old. Surprised to see activity. Sides. Well.

The way I see it, there are two conflicting points of view when it comes to the development of Bitcoin. Small-blockers want Bitcoin to be a digital store of value, much like gold is in the physical world. Big-blockers want Bitcoin to replace FIAT currency and operate as spendable cash worldwide, bringing down the reign banking cartels have held for centuries.

Happy to answer anything else, to the best of my ability."
"A lot of people here believe it's an attempt by central bankers to derail cryptocurrency, which is a huge threat to the monopoly on wealth they hold. They'll site Blockstream – the most staunch 1mb Bitcoin development team – being owned/funded by [AXA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AXA).

Other people think it's because scaling with block size increases just ""kicks the can"" down the road, and we'll have to up the block size every time the network starts reaching capacity. They're not wrong, but nobody has yet provided a working concept solution that addresses the problem (in my opinion) without a hard fork."

"Thanks. And i just skimmed the top of all time for anything i could partially understand

What's Fiat currency?

"FIAT currency is controlled by central bankers. Decentralization of currency is what Bitcoin is all about, if you read [the paper written by the guy who made Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf).

FIAT currency is a shadow on the wall, and those who control the central authority can generate any amount of that currency they wish for themselves or their friends. Bitcoin is different because no one controls the central supply.

This sub is firmly in the big-block category, although you'll find a variety of opinions from all sides of the debate. /r/bitcoin is firmly in the small-block category. You will not find free-flowing exchange of ideas in that sub.

"Okay i just watched the video and it's extremely helpful, so thanks for that.

It seems to me like 10 minutes is way too long and 2,400 transactions per block is *waaay* to small. So why do they keep is so restrictive? Is there a reason?"
So what are the pros and cons of each? 
"#Small block

Small-block logic goes that we should scale slow and without hard-fork methods such as block size increases. It favors second-layer technology that accelerates transactions while removing the signature data from each block. If you want to know how important the signature data is to each transaction, or even WHAT that is, watch [this short 25-minute video](https://youtu.be/bBC-nXj3Ng4). And yes, I'm sorry, 25 minutes is short when it comes to Bitcoin =[

The pros of this strategy are largely in the realm of stabilization. Right now the large-block fork of Bitcoin, called Bitcoin Cash, has a block size EIGHT times the size of the BTC chain. Recently they've been mining mostly-empty blocks to the tune of 50 per hour. It's too fast, rewarding miners for processing blocks that contain zero transactions. This is the scaling problem the small-blockers warned us about.

Meanwhile, the BTC chain is chugging along business as usual. Although, that means high confirmation times and ridiculous fees. Imagine if you had to wait 45 minutes for your Visa to clear so you could go home with tonight's six pack, and the vendor got charged $1.64 just to take your payment. That's where Bitcoin is as ""money"" right now.

#big block

The problem with second-layer solutions is the bottleneck at the on-ramp. If we really want Bitcoin to be used worldwide as a currency free from centralized control, we need it to be readily accessible by even those with rudimentary third-world tech. We're talking people who live of seven dollars a day at the bottom line. The rich and poor alike should have equal access to this revolution in how we think about wealth.

But to have everyone using this improved second layer, we have to get them onto the first layer with just one transaction.

Full Segwit theoretical capacity (on-chain) is 3.7 transactions per second, from what I've researched. Anyone feel free to correct my math. At 3.7 transactions a second, we can only get the entire world population on a second layer after 60 years. And that's ONLY assuming we get everyone on the planet on the main blockhain as fast as possible, 3.7 people per second.

The block size HAS to increase to accommodate the world population, to allow for fast confirmation times, and to facilitate cheap transfer rates. How far this philosophy goes as Bitcoin grows has been a hotly-debated subject."

Thanks "
"> hard-fork methods (what)

Increasing the block size requires a hard fork, which means the nodes upgrading to the new block size have to fork away from those who stay behind. A hard fork is how we split into Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash several weeks back.

> second-layer technology

Let's say we have four transactions on our main blockchain. A gives B $20. B gives C $20. C gives D $20. D gives F $20. An oversimplified definition of second-layer tech would be a system that takes all five transactions and only runs one – A gives F $20 – on the main blockchain.

> (what is mining, what are blocks, and why are they mostly empty?)

Watch that short video. It's quite entertaining and explains things a lot better and quicker than I can!

> (I'm guessing this is what you mean when you say empty, but what does this mean?)

Again, the video. But basically every miner races to find a ""magic number"" that starts with a certain number of zeros so they can validate a block, which is a group of transactions. If blocks are getting validated quicker than transactions are being requested, miners are getting rewarded for lending the network processing power it doesn't need.

> What are layers, and why do we have to get them on the first in one transaction

The main blockchain IS Bitcoin – a history of transactions going back to the very first. Anything on top of it is a second layer. In order to get to layer two, you have to have a Bitcoin wallet. That's only possible, as I understand it, through the main Blockchain and is limited to 3.7 transactions per second. I'm not super educated in this area, though, so my understanding of the ""why"" may be a bit off.

> Full Segwit theoretical capacity (on-chain)

Segwit is a piece of software that altered the way Bitcoin worked by stripping the signature witness data from each transaction and segregating it. Hence the name segregated witness, or Segwit. Remember how I said the block size was fixed at 1mb, limiting the number of transactions Bitcoin can process? Well Segwit theoretically allows more transactions to fit into 1mb, and it does that by making them smaller through segregating that signature data. This is an on-chain scaling solution proposed by small-blockers, but it requires everyone to be using Segwit wallets in order to function at max capacity.

> 3.7 transactions per second, (is that a lot? What does that mean?)

No, it's not a lot. It causes congestion, which leads to longer confirmation times and higher fees. It Bitcoin's early days, the user base was small enough that this wasn't a problem. Since we mined our first full 1mb block, though, transactions have only been getting slower and fees have climbed from pennies to dollars.

> main blockhain (is that just a bunch of blocks)

The difference is you get the maximum amount of bitcoin by just mining as hard as possible 100% of the time, you can maximise your BCH by _not_ mining for periods. 

This only works for BCH as there aren't that many miners, so they can game the system, you cannot do this for bitcoin, if you took 500 petahash off the network, then the block time goes up, but its managed by the difficulty retarget, not by EDA. 

Ironically, I don't believe in BCH, but I've switched to using NiceHash to sell my mining power, during the EDA adjusted periods I'm being paid more in bitcoin."

Then you fundamentally fail to understand why Bitcoin works. The entire point is that everyone is supposed to be greedy. 

Greedy miners with tens of millions (if not billions) invested in infrastructure to mine the Bitcoin network will act in the best interests of Bitcoin (which is also in the interests of the users). Miner's success is directly correlated to Bitcoin's."

I'm betting it's not possible to go toe toe with a drastically larger hashrate chain without changing the pow. Not only are these EDA concerns one thing, but the chain is also open to an ever persistent potential for a 51% attack. I fail to see how that can possibly scream safe store of value to anyone.  "
"I think perhaps it takes too long to kick in, and when it does, it does too much; but it's only too much when the profitability is close to the other chain. Might work better if it starts correcting much sooner, but does so in a much more gradual manner, while still producing the same total amount of change over the same period of time as the original EDA if conditions don't change. And maybe it would be better if it was based on time instead of block count, and symmetrical instead of just downward.

The chain has too little hashrate proportional to how many miners are attracted when the profitability crosses the parity line, and so the difficulty adjustment corrects more than it should when it brings the chain above the parity line; but the adjustment size is reasonable when the parity line isn't crossed."
Changing difficulty every block would mean constant 10 minute blocks?  What s the variance?  The change in difficulty would be a response to a difference in hashrate....so a variance of hashrate is met with a variance in difficulty to cancel it out to get a constant 10 minute block.  I do not see an issue here.
Lol. You guys use too much logic. Their cognitive dissonance heads won’t be able to understand.  
"This is what they should have done in regards to ""EDA"": Along with the fork occurring, a one time difficulty decrease should have gone in effect that lowers the difficulty value by a percentage derived from an estimation of hashpower that will appear on the BCH chain. For instance, if it was estimated that 25% of miners will leave BTC and start mining BCH, then the BCH difficulty value should have dropped by 75% with *no other modifications*. No changes to the actual algorithm is needed, just a change to the actual value to correspond to the amount of hashpower they actually have. As long as the estimation is in the right ballpark, it would have been enough to allow the chain to survive.

The way to fix EDA is to revert back to the original difficulty algorithm that satoshi designed."
Sorry - I FEEL that at 50 blocks per hour it would take 2 hours for 100 blocks to be mined 
Couldn't you just use a moving average then?

Your statement, while being correct, does not invalidate any of my arguments in any way."

"In section 4 of the Bitcoin white paper Satoshi explains how miners accept transactions and mine then into a block based on proof of work. He **then goes on to add:**

> The proof-of-work **also** solves the problem of determining representation in majority decisionmaking

Satoshi is clear here: miners not only vote on transaction ordering but also on everything else, because proof of work is the determinant of validity. 

Miners can choose to make the coin more desirable through beneficial changes, or less desirable through harmful changes, but only a miner can change a rule, as non miners don't create anything either valid or invalid."
">That's the reason why the current EDA algorithm adjusts the difficulty even if no blocks are mined.

No it doesn't."
It is no urgent to increase the blocksize atm, when BCH can't even have a steady block rate. EDA change is the highest priory right now, otherwise, the users will be scared away, by then bigger blocksize is pointless.
">To be fair I don't think satoshi really imagined the multi-coin universe we'd be in today. 

This is true. One area in which it's clear Satoshi hadn't reasoned far enough in advance is development. Satoshi seemed to view developers as a benevolent monopoly and seems to have paid little attention to how easy it would be to capture and subvert a GitHub repo. In fact I think that Satoshi thought he had covered his tracks and was anonymous and would always be the benevolent dictator of the development monopoly.

He also thought that miners would mine according to their perception of their economic interests. Until the beginning of June of this year a plurality of miners thought that larger blocks were in their best interests and a minority thought Segwit was in their best interests, yet miners began mining a Segwit chain in force and are toying around with the large block chain they previously preferred."

Causing chaos?
And miners would uniformly mine the chain they can game.

"They need to make it a html5 game where the player either tries to get more coins over the same amount of time, or crash the chain, by manipulating the ""hashrate""; and collect statistics and stuff to see if anyone figures out a strategy to break the algorithm.

Of course, it needs to include both chains in the simulation, and several price change scenarios.

One possible way of control for both hashrate power and distribution between chains, would be to use the mouse, with the vertical position controlling the total hashrate, and the horizontal position controlling the distribution between chains (with the cursor at the middle of the screen, the hashrate would be distributed 50/50 between the chains).

If anyone can figure out the cracks in the algorithm, it's gamers.

edit: Or maybe a similar setup, but instead of human players, have neural nets and evolutionary algorithms."
Perhaps, like update difficulty every block based on the average hashrate over the last 100 blocks? It might work. I'm not sure if nodes would have problems though coming to agreement on what to set difficulty to if they need to calculate it every 10 minutes. 
"You're a moron who is making shit up.

No, this is FUD.  There are technical solutions and they are being worked on.  ETC and ETH coexist quite well.  Ignore this FUD bullshit.  This isn't the impossibility drive -- it's just engineering a good algorithm.

How on earth do you figure that? Any imbalance would be corrected in a few dozen blocks if bch's hashrate fell significantly. It could be even faster than EDA adjustment in a lot of cases."

I'm inclined to agree here.
Trust?  In miners?  Are you nuts?  
Interesting idea.  But I believe it's wrong.  Say you have 10% of all hashrate, then you should get 10% of all rewards.  With your algorithm, it will not play out that way...instead you will get (I believe 5%).  What that will do to incentives and miners - I have no idea.  But thats a BIG change to everything.
"Jesus Christ, really?

This is a fucking joke. BCH will be dead in a week."
There should never have to be trust... That's why I think the EDA is broken and miners should never control protocol.

How disappointing to see this. People followed them to buy BCH now they are the one who exploit and abuse the trust for short term profit.
They can't even code up two lines of code that the guy who created Bitcoin already outlined for them.
"Totally agree with the notion. Yet, very disappointingly, what we hear from the miners is that they are going to WAIT & SEE. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/74czbc/antpool_viabtc_bitcoincom_btccom_we_need_to_hear/dnxelyu/"
From a theoretical point of view, if all miners act rationally, can switch chain instantly, and only prioritize short-term profit, there won't be a single block mined on the BCH chain as long as it's more profitable to mine BTC.  That's the reason why the current EDA algorithm adjusts the difficulty even if no blocks are mined.  I think that's a feature it's important to keep.
But after this grinding EDA en next reward half we can just double the 21M cap.?    It’s just a number, miners wouldn’t care..
I'm not convinced. 
Miners chase profit so hard that they readily abandon Core. You're making my point. Oscillations are a problem of EDA. Ideology is clearly not required to attract miners, it is required to keep stability under the current algorithm. The algorithm will be upgraded and you'll be eating your words.
Ideology is not required to attract miners. It is temporarily beneficial if an ideological miner dampens the effect of clumsy algorithm. Also are you implying that both chains are not working as intended? Otherwise we should see 100% switching.
"Well I agree that's too rapid and frankly I don't think there should be any EDAs and that would lead to Bitcoin Cash just dying off. 

But the objective of Bitcoin Cash it would appear is to not care for what miners think as to weather or not it should exist. As such it needs a means of rapid difficulty reduction to achieve this goal. The only way to the counter act rapid hashrate increase is to make it so difficulty adjusts up just as quickly as it can go down. This way BCH gets to acheive it's objective of never die off regardless of POW and it doesn't get artificially fast block times as a result of difficulty going up as slow as initially intended by Bitcoin.

"I said...

> because we operate under the assumption that miners are greedy and will do what is in their best interest

Then you said...

>Then you fundamentally fail to understand why Bitcoin works. The entire point is that everyone is supposed to be greedy. 

Did I not just say we operate under the assumption that miners are greedy? So what am I failing to understand?

The part where we differ is..

>[miners] will act in the best interests of Bitcoin (which is also in the interests of the users). Miner's success is directly correlated to Bitcoin's.

This is false. Miners will act in their own best interests. In your ideal situation their interests align with the users and the network as a whole, but as BCH has shown us, that isn't necessarily true. We have to assume the miners will act in their own best interest, full stop. The question then is, when do their interests depart from being the same as mine and yours? Well, competing chains that can be mined with the same hardware, where one has a difficulty adjustment they can game for profit is one example as we've seen. Clearly their interest haven't aligned with the users of BCH, otherwise this thread wouldn't exist, nor have they aligned with the users of BTC.

So yes, miners are greedy, but relying on their greed to always align with your/Bitcoin's interests is where *you* seem to fundamentally fail to understand those of us who are critical of the idea that miners = bitcoin."
No. That is the barrier. 
"> if it has a lower return than the current situation?

Because it won't have a lower return than the current situation if the market is demanding a change to the current situation."
No matter how the price goes they can EDA the difficulty low enough to make mining worth their while.
"> [M]iners are greedy and will do what is in their best interest, not necessarily what is in the best interest of users.

This is how the game theory behind Bitcoin works. Satoshi Nakomoto realized that miners could not be trusted to act in the best interests of users. That's why he designed a system that relies only on miners acting in their own interest.

The benefit to users is a byproduct of the game theory underlying Bitcoin. There is no assumption anywhere in the original paper that users' ""best"" interests are served, for any reasonable definition of ""best"".
