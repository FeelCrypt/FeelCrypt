">pushing for the destruction of BTC to make way for BCH

I don't think the sub is collectively pushing for this. I think there are some people who see BCH as a fast track to riches so it is in their best interest for it to succeed, and some people think the only way for that to happen is for 
 BTC to fail. Personally, I would like to see many coins succeed, just in the way that we have many possible methods to pay with fiat. I do not have any ill-will toward BTC. However, I think some of the most intense vitriol you witness is a result of some people feeling that BTC has gone in the wrong direction. There is a general feeling that the bitcoin community has been monopolized and co-opted in a clandestine manner. I do not wish to continue to comment on this. However, if you do some digging, you will most likely find that something is wrong in the BTC community, not just limited to r/Bitcoin. You must understand that many people who have been involved with bitcoin since the beginning feel that BCH is the 'true' bitcoin, and that bitcoin core has instead gone in the wrong direction.  I leave that up to you to decide how you feel about this. Perhaps we will see more information come to the forefront of the bitcoin collective consciousness in the near future. You should know that if I were to post this comment on r/bitcoin or even bitcointalk.org, it would be deleted by mods. I also wish to reiterate that a lot of what I am saying is based on what I have read others say on r/btc, and is not necessarily my own viewpoint regarding BTC/BCH. Remember, the love of money is the root of all evil, and there are LOTS of people in the bitcoin community who fucking love money.

You think ""I've never been banned, and I have SUPER controversial opinions"", but what actually happened is that your super controversial opinions used to be quite mild relative to some other people but all those people have since been banned.  You might fall barely inside of the permitted topics and thus think ""I'm so rebellious and I don't get banned, obviously no one gets banned then"" because you're only comparing yourself to the permitted segment of topics but you're not seeing the HUGE segment of people who were MORE rebellious and DID get banned so their viewpoint is no longer discussed or considered as part of your ""rebellious opinions"".

All I can see is what I've experienced myself and  that plenty of partisan rhetoric on both /r/Bitcoin and /r/BTC. I have no doubt that both subs have spread propaganda about the other. Why wouldn't they?  It becomes hard to tell what's true and what isn't, what's just an allegation and what's a fact.

are the /r/bitcoin shills really this dumb? Like, there's no way they're convincing anyone with this pathetic garbage. Not saying it was... but anyone willing to own up to a false flag here? That's literally the only explanation I can think of. No one is this stupid.
"About 6 months ago BitPay announced that Bitcoin had become ""unusable"" due to high fees and slow confirmation times.
Surely their failure to route around this problem is political, not technical, paralysis. If so, then someone in charge needs to make an executive decision to get their business model back on track."
"I did not know that, interesting.

This is what bothers me most about these merchants. They aren't ""organic"" in the sense that they really aren't ""accepting crypto"" as payment. Sure, they let their customers pay in crypto, but only through a conversion layer.

Although in the same breath I can understand their mentality. The risk is too high and if they take too much risk and lose then they're out of business.

I think this will change the more fiat dies and the more crypto blows up to the moon."

"> ""the first Bitcoin clone""

If you refer to ""the first fork of the Bitcoin software"", then I think Namecoin carries that title."
"I disagree. I think you're being too reactive. 

SegWit2X came about from an agreement just among the most significant components of the Bitcoin Ecosystem (with the notable exception of the BlockStream Corporation, but they keep reminding us that they don't represent Bitcoin so who cares). 

That was just 3 months ago. 

The community has already done the first part of the agreement, activating SegWit, and now we're waiting to see if the rest of the community activates the second part of the agreement (the 2x block size increase). 

3 months is too quick to call something depreciated.... but it has been long enough for holdout elements of the Bitcoin Dev Community to make their true colors even more obvious. The 2x activation in less than 90 days will result in the SegWit chain falling apart (due to Dev and minor ecosystem player holdouts) or success. 

I personally think it'll fall apart and everyone will move to Bitcoin Cash... but if that happens, it needs to be because of those Blockstream affiliated holdouts, not because serious companies like BitPay 'changed their mind'. 

It needs to happen this way so those clowns that have ruined Bitcoin for the last 3 years will be disgraced and never be taken seriously by anyone ever again. "
They can't behave like the dipshits at Blockstream. Their reputation is on the table.
They should never have signed those papers. That's the problem. 
"> There are no clauses that actually bind any involved party to only pursue SegWit2x and nothing else.

That's what I said already. They should not support segwit2x only. "
They should just embed shapeshift into their own system to present a unified interface to the users.
"I hope their backup is a) bitcoin Cash and b) the same as every other NYAer.

They should make their own choices but co-ordinating a definition of success/failure would help: 'SegWit2x goal to maintain a single chain has failed if x with 2 weeks' And Lo, BCH *is* Bitcoin."
I love bch, but it does appear that sw2x will be the most secure chain very soon and bitpay/purse will be supporting it.
[deleted]
From a merchant's PoV it's a no brainer. As you say, API compatibility makes swuitching providers a few minutes' ordeal. 
You'd better believe we're trying to.
Sorry I should have mentioned that I was being super sarcastic 
but you can do this too. Services like Coinbase can give you BTC addresses where everything you send is immediately converted to fiat
Thanks, unfortunately I have no connection to him.
I think its more what does LTC offer over Bitcoin or other coins? Not much, its just a copy of Bitcoin without the name recognition, whilst other coins are doing different things (ie. Etherium with smart contracts) that make them valuable for that.
No one uses LTC for anything at all.  Oh, and it's entirely mined by China to a far greater extent than even Bitcoin.
"LTC:   

- Was never popular and didn't inherit the original Satoshi ledger, hence was not very widely distributed (unlike Bitcoin Cash). Note that this is very important economically - fair yet wide distribution is a _hard_ problem.

- Has no real technical merit over Bitcoin Core/Cash other than a faster block speed (unlike ETH, which is programmable _and_ popular; or even Monero, which is truly anonymous but unfortunately does not have a light client and did not get popular)

It basically only holds the title as ""the first Bitcoin clone"", that's it, nothing else. Would be just another shitcoin if not for its sheer age. "
Actually pursuing deprecated things like SegWit2x will make people believe that they are stubborn and outdated. mySpace is an excellent example of that behavior.
How legally binding is the agreement really? Are there contractual penalty clauses  with large fines, or just a gentleman's agreement? I say break the agreement and go hard on Cash.
"Of course they can abandon SegWit2x at any time.

That whole thing is basically a nonbinding agreement. 

There are no clauses that actually bind any involved party to *only* pursue SegWit2x and nothing else."
"Good to see!

My time travel clock must be slightly off ;)"
It would be terrible PR for them. Whether you like it or not, BCH trades like an alt. They would be a poor man's Shapeshift with lesser features and lose the simplicity of only using one coin. 
"I can kind of, sort of respect their decision to stick _really hard_ to the 2X agreement, but the prospect of a ""clean"" hardfork there is fading every day due to Core obstruction. Extension block is a no-go since... well, it doesn't seem like it can gain any traction. 

They _have_ to have a backup plan - perhaps having a separate ""Cash"" tab on their payment page - in case 2X crashes and burns. Segwit is not gonna save them."
No longer. All hail Bitcoin Cash.
Bitpay is committed to the most secure blockchain. Period. I salute them for their allegiance to satoshi's vision and contributions to the ecosystem.
Nonsense.  Overstock keeps 50% of their bitcoin purchases as bitcoin and has the other half converted to fiat.  Their choice.  Overstock uses Coinbase's processing service.

The divorce already happened. It is permanent. Both sides are really genuine happy now.

Maybe we should really cancel the complete unnecessary marriage counseling for good (SegWit2x)"
All bitcoins need to hard fork in order to improve the code haha. We are talking about the next month or so.
I think they make their money on spread between their rates and exchanges. It's 0% all you want when you set the base price. I think when I looked into it as a merchant I was going with the 1% fees option. This could have changed now.
Hey man, what about merchant services for buying coffee etc? Have you guys started on your POS systems? I want to sell some POS systems to local businesses.
He can claim what he wants, end of the day he's just a nobody.
True, it is a decentralized registrar. My only point is it was the first fork of Bitcoin. I don't dispute your other statements.
"I agree with you entirely. I think they should add Bitcoin Cash and just finish up the SegWit2x work they're in the middle of (testing, integration, etc for the bcoin library) to make sure it works in case SegWit2X does happen. 

And yea, SegWit2X is a pile of crap, but everyone knew that. Sometimes the only way to heal a community is with a compromise that leaves both sides unhappy and I do think that SegWit2x was an honest attempt to make that happen. 

It's possible that the pain and division of this civil war has resulted in a community split that couldn't be healed anymore. If that's the case, SegWit2x just won't work. "
Agreed
"> a new company offering a range of cryptos at slightly lower fees would eat into them in mere weeks, I hope they realise this.

Lol no. You should start that company if you believe so. Make it api-compatible with Bitpay.

Not sure where they earn their money nowadays, do you?"
"> 2) Maybe there really isn't that much demand as I don't think they are stupid.

I think this is the culprit as well, and with bitcoin being as unusable as it is, it's no wonder. But cryptos are here to stay, and betting on low usability to continue being the norm is ridiculous.

It reminds me of Chrysler and Ford refusing to understand that EVs are not only the future, but the **very near** future."
Thanks so much. Honestly you just mentioning us this way is a great way to start my morning. It's humbling to see /r/btc recognizing us :)
Who are you?
But AXA still controls Blockstream right???

Namecoin was never intended as a payment system though. 
"I don't say BitPay should disable BSCoreCoin immediately and enable Bitcoin cash. I think they should simply *add* Bitcoin cash as a payment and no longer waste precious resources on SegWit2x.

And are you aware how dangerous your proposal is for BitPay? I mean if they are stubborn and focus on to SegWit2x only, the market could replace them faster than one can imaging. All it takes is a tipping point and then it is very hard to reverse the trend. Once a competitor gains traction it could be game over for them. Again, just look at mySpace.

And SegWi2x was not something that *anybody* wanted. It was a compromise that was just about equally *bad* for everybody."
They're at least as bad already, tricking people into installing btc1 was as underhanded as anything done by anyone in this space.  They should have been clear and/or announce support for BCH.
They should stop wasting precious development resources (actually *any* resources) on SegWit2x and instead add Bitcoin cash payments ASAP.
Like Keats in Rome I'm also wondering if there is any info somewhere supporting that segwit 2x will be a success. Is it merely the compromise that miners did months ago? 
How can it be the most secure chain when it is soon to undergo a contentious hard fork and has the possibility of a chain death spiral in comparison to BCH? Just wondering why you think that.
Agreed with you, yet people are still using Bitpay and Bitpay with tens of overpaid developers hasn't implemented Ethereum yet. Two options: 1) They are sitting on a ton of Bitcoin and are gonna cash out at the top, to then announce the newer options, 2) Maybe there really isn't that much demand as I don't think they are stupid.
'the most secure chain' has traditionally referred to the chain that represents the most work done and directly reflects the improbability of changing events in the past. It says nothing about forks because at the block of the fork, they have the same difficulty. The thing that keeps the network together is the difficulty adjustment and has been compromised somewhat with bitcoin cash. I still love Bitcoin cash, but the emergency difficulty adjustment is it's worst feature.
Rocketr might be able to eat their lunch. /u/rawb0t ? 
"That ""agreement"" is worth less than the toilet paper it was written on, they should flush away these pedantic agreements and simply use what works for them rather than pandering to every sociopathic zealot that aligns themselves with Blockstream Core.

They seem to completely forget that regular users is who they should be serving, not the miners, developers, or the foaming at the mouth psychos."
Because my suppliers, employees and the taxman need to be paid in not bitcoin.
"What? 3 forks? Surely you are wrong. I was just reading in bitcoin that there were no forks and that BCH was an Altcoin. -_- censorship is a myth.

Edit: Read Sarcastically "
"I still don't understand why merchants keep using these services. It's the blockchain, people! All you need to do is generate an address, tell your customers how much to pay and then periodically check for the balance.

Don't give companies like bitpay a share of your money for something you can code in an hour.

Even more awesome: Give them a prepay account. Every customer gets one BTC address and they can put BTC on it whenever they want (even if they're not currently on your website) and you have a backend script that checks every minute the balance of all customers and if one changes, give them your credits. It's really simple

For ETH [I wrote a short tutorial](https://blog.haschek.at/post/f1417) but it's the same for bitcoin."
Bch is not an altcoin. It's a continuation of the original blockchain minus blockstreams segwit bloat and gets aligned back with satoshis original vision. It's what bitcoin should have been years ago if it had scaled to bigger blocks. 
What's wrong with shapeshift?? 
Yep, BitPay and Coinbase need to get multi coin support pushed out and let consumers choose.  Dash should really be in there too since it's focused on consumer payments.  Maybe even a couple others.
LTC and ETH options would be great!
I normally wouldn't suggest this, but perhaps Bitpay should also sue a few select people for libel -- especially Theymos and Peter Todd. 
Please add Monero to that list. :)
Any good way to contact Bitpay directly?

If they don't do it, someone will. I would have added support for ethereum or even dash long ago.
"https://github.com/bitpay

Maybe one day someone will create a clone and name it ""Bitcoin CashPay"" and integrate only ""Bitcoin"" (cash) and reach out to all the merchants who used to and currently use Bitpay. 

Or Bitpay will catch up.

I think your beef with Shapeshift is misguided. They are supporting what they can support in practice and leaving politics aside. 
" If BitPay starts accepting Bitcoin Cash, it's ""Game over"" for Bitcoin SegWit. "
"I agree that they should support Bitcoin cash at least. But Shapeshift isn't ""dodgy"", it's Eric Vorhees' company, backed by Ver and Silbert. "
"A community that is supposed to be money who consistently pushes companies and people away is one that is only ever going to diminish and fall flat. People don't care about the technicals, they just want it to work, they don't want excuses, they want efficiency and easy of use.

Bitpay think about your customers, I assume it would be pretty trivial for you to support bitcoin cash when compared to other cryptos. I recommend and hope you do."
"Stephen Pair, CEO of BitPay [wrote before](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6bj93h/stephen_pair_on_twitter_supporting_2mb8mb/dhnai4i/)

> **our business model needs only one chain, the most secure and most widely adopted chain** (with the caveat that some fundamental tenants aren't violated) ... we will follow the miners in all likelihood as they have not proposed anything that we deem to be in violation of any core tenants of bitcoin ... and we are pretty certain that the chain with more capacity will be more widely adopted than the chain with less capacity (seems kind of obvious as I write that)"
BitPay doesn't deserve the abuse coordinated by Blockstream. Seeing a github Issue spawn into an overt hateful campaign by Mow and others was disgusting.
Shapeshift isn't dodgy, it's run by Erik Voorhees and it's a pretty impressive exchange.  Not having to create an account is a pretty big deal.  They made a useful tool that also abides by our principles that privacy is important.
DOGE has a large community and they sponsored a Nascar.
"> If so, then someone in charge needs to make an executive decision to get their business model back on track.

That or, someone else will. There's certainly a huge barrier to entry given that BitPay is the industry leader, and is integrated everywhere, but a new company offering a range of cryptos at slightly lower fees would eat into them in mere weeks, I hope they realise this.

You can't be in a cutting edge industry and sit on your laurels as the tech continues changing. "
Oh ya, sounds awesome. Good luck!
"Everyone needs to contact them and tell them to support Bitcoin Cash. Here is their [twitter](https://twitter.com/bitpay?lang=en) account that you can tweet them at.

I've already contacted them and voiced my desire to see them support Bitcoin Cash. Have _you_?"
Don't underestimate their support costs.
"> All you need to do is generate an address, tell your customers how much to pay and then periodically check for the balance.

It doesn't work that way in real life. It would be inefficient, time is money and business owners don't want to manually handle payments, because when receiving an order all that happens isn't just that money exchanges hands, but the order gets logged in the system, invoices and receipts are generated and sent out, stock is subtracted, the transaction is added to the financial books and tax is calculated. Processors like bitpay handle all of this automatically."
The oringal appeal was for merchants to want purchases converted to fiat although I dont know why they want that either...
"> I still don't understand why merchants keep using these services

As I understand it, Bitpay will immediately convert to fiat for the merchant, so they never actually touch the cryptocurrency. They do this because the crypto is so volatile and they're scared to commit."
"Litecoin didn't have a single innovaton in four years,  one year ago you were lucky to see 4 people in the litecoin subreddit.  Two years ago litecoin was $1.65.   Litecoin would be almost dead and buried now had they not implemented segwit which wasn't even their idea.

Litecoin is a piece of shit coin and the community lucked out like you wouldn't believe by activating segwit.  

Quite frankly,  it is an insult to the hard work and innovation from the Ethereum community to even mention litecoin and Ethereum in the same sentence."
"Just ask Ver, according to his profile on Twitter he's an investor: https://twitter.com/rogerkver

Hi I'm brand new here - I wondered if you could explain why you dislike LTC? Trying to learn what makes a good coin vs a bad coin but it's a huge **mine**field right now. Pun intended.
"Whatever coins make up 80% marketshare then, bitcoin is down to 48%

I am not tied to any particular currency, in my eyes they are tools to be used."
">About 6 months ago BitPay announced that Bitcoin had become ""unusable"" due to high fees and slow confirmation times. Surely their failure to route around this problem is political, not technical, paralysis.

Bullshit.

I used Bitpay myself years ago, when I wanted to make payments for my VPS. Back then, transaction fees were low and transactions were readily confirmed. It's now no longer possible to use bitcoin to pay for such purchases, unless you're willing to let a third party administer your bitcoin on your behalf. BitPay's business model is dying because the developers insist on an arbitrary 1 MB cap originally intended to protect against spam attacks."
"BitPay is more than just the payment portal. They're also a group of developers who make important software in the ecosystem. They're trying to be taken seriously as experts and to be seen as reliable. 

They said that they're behind SegWit2x so they need to continue to back it. Stopping early would make people believe that they're unreliable in various ways. 

I'm sure they're also being smart business people and looking at Bitcoin Cash and AltCoins as part of their business plans. "
They signed the agreement, they cannot. But they should embrace Bitcoin Cash too. It would be crazy to boycott Bitcoin Cash. 
Don't underestimate their support costs.
"Bitpay already have made support for bitcoin cash, see:

I don't have a beef with them, its just it feels wrong having to refer clients to use a 3rd party site as a way to bypass bitpay's limitation.
As a software dev I always wonder why companies don't support multiple cryptos. If they built their system  correctly the first time it should be trivial to add a new one. Unfortunately it seems that a lot of them didn't plan for the future. 
It's the exact same system, plug and play, total no brainer
"> BitPay doesn't deserve the abuse

In time, bitpay will integrate cash for their merchants and users.

Meanwhile, here is what the other side potentially is saying (while simultaneously shooting themselves in the foot as they go crash and burn in a blaze of glory):

'I can't believe you fell for the obvious outright lie that everyone else other than you already knew: that we were totally and completely full of shit about ever increasing the blocksize so you could increase the revenue of your business model per time unit; how could you be so gullible as to believe us that we were going to increase the blocksize, are you truly that naive about us, and how absolutely worthless our word is?'"
What do they do in the middle ground where the high capacity chain doesn't have the adoption yet? It seems like a huge waste to be a crypto payment processing company and only support one flavor. They should be driving adoption rather than following!
Someone will start a competing service and put BitPay out of their misery.
Erik is an honest guy and has done a lot for the community. Not dodgy in the least. 
"Shapeshift is a fantastic service. I've used it many times.

The one downside is that it can be expensive, but you are paying for convenience: no account needed, just give receive address and return address, then send the amount requested.

It's exactly the sort of thing the Crypto world needs. For many people, using Shapeshift would be the only way they can get some altcoins without getting registered and going through lengthy vetting processes on exchanges."
Yep .. Shapeshift is a really needed and useful service.. and Eric has been a good ambassador of Bitcoin from the early days.

"> About 6 months ago BitPay announced that Bitcoin had become ""unusable"" due to high fees and slow confirmation times. Surely their failure to route around this problem is political, not technical, paralysis.


What makes you think it's paralysis of any kind? BitPay is a commercial company and we have only a superficial idea of what their current plans are (emphasis on multiple plans that depend on external factors). 

We do know that they are one of the most economically significant participants in the NYA. I personally hope and expect them to go through with the 2x hardfork and I think it's really shitty that people here are trying to persuade people to pull out. 

I also recall them actively working on extension blocks and I would expect that they are still working on assessing the viability of that solution.

Switching their services over to Bitcoin Cash or any other coin is probably something they have investigated. But I'd be surprised if it's any higher than ""plan C"" at this point."
">BitPay doesn't deserve the abuse coordinated by Blockstream.

Blockstream is trying to force people to use their patented sidechain:

I agree. But if you're just a user then it's another nugget of knowledge/confidence that adds drop-off to the checkout funnel.
