Why must it die? Let people use fiat if they want. Just let the ideas compete
Wouldn't be the first time if Core reneged an agreement...
Too bad though that BTC has been infiltrated by the forces behind fiat.
"https://txhighway.com

Not sure if btch should rather be north korea"
lol so good...
But fiat is the one controlling BTC.
I only fire *back*, but I don't anticipate I'll have the opportunity to stop anytime soon.
This is concern trollign at it's finest. BTC has NO arguments on its side, so now we are equal and must be friends?
Not everyone wants the war to end. Post this on /r/Bitcoin and see how much hate you get.
If fiat completely dies my 78 year old grandmother is going to have a very hard time the last 10 or 20 years of her life. I don't want that at all. 
"So? That's morality. It has no place in Science

Fiat isn't controlling this subreddit. 
"I put BTC as NK for a couple reasons, one the rampant censorship and attacks against BCH, which is more akin to NK's treatment of its opponents. Secondly because Kim is fatter than his SK counterpart, much as BTC is bigger in price. Third because of the widespread belief that the Core devs are bad actors in how they have handled the chain split and demonize all who don't fall in line behind them, as well as the rampant DDOS of nodes that tried to run other implementations in the past.

Sure anyone with BTC sentiment is going to disagree with which is which, but that can't be avoided.

BTC having more transactions per second at this point in time is a temporary historical period that likely won't last long, and they'll never have that again for obvious reasons."
Central banks are evil bruh
Who said anything about science
Who said anything about a bruh?
Yeah sure we'll all magically disappear in 2 years.
"Yes, there is ONE True enemy (Rulers), but part of their defense HAS been core/BlockStream etc... And they have slowed [Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash ](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/bitcoin/) adoption by a few yrs as MANY early in the struggle have said themselves!

So, I dont believe completely ignoring the crippled coin and its *supporters* is a good move. They may be somewhat of a diversion, but battling them is part of educating newcomers IMO."
"RemindMe! 2 years ""2 years from now BCH will be gone."""
"""Let's End the War"" but you just compared BTC to a 3rd world dictator that runs concentration camps. This is some next level passive aggressive shit. "
I dont get your point. I watched this block explorer about one minute constantly. There are almost no btch transactions compared to btc. Btch looks like an north korean highway for me. Two years from now on and its gone...
We will see a lot of these posts as BCH gains more traction.
Bitcoin is not only science, you can have blocks each 0.000001s without orphaning running on cold fusion power^TM and still it can fail if people simply prefer to trust in corrupt central banks.
Hey nice spin on that, haha.
To the interested parties, not the whole world. 
Do you know how religion works? Humans invoke some god, and claim to speak in the name of that god. This saves them the trouble of actually having to make their own arguments.
"I thought G B meant ""Good Britain"""
"But how is it ""broken""? The chain can still be reconstructed from the Witness Merkle tree that is stored in the block along side of the rest of the transaction data. [Andreas Antonopoulos has just published a video explaining it actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtOjjB4mD8k&feature=youtu.be&t=568).

I can concede that the data structures make the chain more complex to read, but the data is present and stored in the blockchain."
"It's still more decentralized with an additional 10k 16connection pruned nodes than if nothing happens at all.

I keep mine set at like 15000 which is about 100 days worth of blocks."
"here, i got you a cheat sheet: https://retroshare.readthedocs.io/en/latest/img/concept/network-history.png

compare the topology to lightning: https://lnmainnet.gaben.win

no further questions. if you can't see that lightning has always been decentralized you are probably a paid shill and won't listen to reason anyway. "
That's why having a Sybil-resistant decentralized system is so revolutionary. Why are you here?
I don't know, but since Satoshi wanted Bitcoin to be used by the world, 32MB isn't nearly enough - even with L2 solutions.  
When all financial transactions, contracts, and social media content of the entire world is kept on BCH blockchain.
"I think BCH is sending the message out that this branch is dedicated to on-chain scaling.  You can't expect people to take you seriously when you release 1GB blocksize research data - when you are timid about increasing to even 32MB.

I fully expect the 32MB (which is baked into the protocol of Bitcoin) limit to also be removed by end of next year.



"

"You may not realize it, but is a very good sign when BCH not only gets the attention of supporters, but also the attention of non-supporters.  I think Bitcoin Gold, Ripple, and tons of other coins - are a complete waste of time, but I don't waste my time and energy in their forums.  The fact that we get so much energy being directed here instead of directed at building up BTC - is very encouraging.

Enjoy your stay!"
"I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

- [/r/911truth] [Bitcoin Cash is upgrading on May 15 to 32MB max block limit](https://www.reddit.com/r/911truth/comments/8fp2oo/bitcoin_cash_is_upgrading_on_may_15_to_32mb_max/)

&nbsp;*^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))*"
If the average blocksize is 50K, then what difference does it make if the upper limit is 8MB or 32MB?  What's the problem?
"Thus the change of verbiage in the title to ""upgrade"", through the technical mechanism of a hard fork."
A few months back BCH got a 100MB backlog briefly - and some miners were still mining 1MB and 2MB blocks.  With 32MB - I can't wait for the next load test.
"Jesus Christ man - what are you so rabid about? You don't have to be so fearful - just buy some BCH to hedge your bets.  The best way to protest BCH is basically not supporting it financially.  You don't have to spend the very finite limited time you have left on earth spitting hateful comments on some reddit forum of a coin you despise.  You could be doing almost anything that is more worthwhile than this.  

Spend your time to improve BTC adoption - that's the way to beat BCH.  Coming here and acting like an angry teenager just gives the impression that ""the other side"" really has nothing left but trolling.

But I understand its a bit tough since BTC has crippled the ability to build anything useful on top of it.
And to develop Lightning - well good luck on getting into that club.

Actually there IS something you can do - make some Youtube tutorials on how to install and use an LN node!

op_return data size increase will have a huge impact on new apps on the BCH blockchain.
There is a need for this.  Bigger data for op_return will enable a host of new apps on BCH.
*thenewsouthafrica* just made a brilliant observation!  How were we so blind not to see that!!! The upgrade is off everybody.
Top! Thanks for answering.
This is *technically* a hard fork - but its not caused by a splitting of the community.  So you can call it an upgrade.  When for all practical purposes 100% of the nodes will upgrade, it can be called an upgrade for publicity reasons.
"Which is why I said what I said.  They made no attempt to turn bitcoin into a trademark, thus they don't own it and anyone else can use it.  Someone could actually try to turn it into a trademark right now if they wanted.  All they have to do is register it and fire off cease and desist letters.  If no one fought them, they would take control.

But as of now, bitcoin is an untrademarked term anyone can use."
"You are mistaken.  A “community movement” that amounts over 600 individuals in just two  days is pursuing legal action against Bitcoin.com and its owner, **Roger  Ver, for deliberately misleading new users into buying Bitcoin Cash  \(BCH\) instead of Bitcoin.** [**http://ccbeast.com/lawsuit\-from\-over\-6000\-bitcoin\-users\-against\-bitcoin\-com\-and\-ceo\-roger\-ver/**](http://ccbeast.com/lawsuit-from-over-6000-bitcoin-users-against-bitcoin-com-and-ceo-roger-ver/)

That's the link that's on the top of bitcoinmarkets if that's what you mean."
nope
"[Dollar.com](https://Dollar.com) calls it ""American Cash \(USC\)"".

[Dollar.org](https://Dollar.org) calls it ""American dollars \(USD\)"".

[Bitcoin.com](https://Bitcoin.com)  calls it ""Bitcoin cash \(BCH\)"", but it is hardly mentioned at all.

[Bitcoin.org](https://Bitcoin.org) calls ""Bitcoin \(BTC\)""

You even left off the cash in your post.  ""Bitcoin \(BCH\)"". If that was intentional can you please explain how ""Bitcoin \(BTC\)"" and ""Bitcoin \(BCH\)"" could not be easily confused. There is one letter difference there.

""Bitcoin cash"" is mentioned 5 times on [bitcoin.com](https://bitcoin.com) BCH is mentioned 3 times. Bitcoin is mentioned 60 times.

Tell me, as a casual user are you really going to understand the difference between the two, when Bitcoin is mention twelve times more than ""bitcoin cash"" in isolation. They do not have the charts for BCH and that is their fucking coin. The purchase page neither lists the pricing of each coin, nor displays the logo. Only difference is cash vs core and amount of coins you get. I would class that as near fraudulent level of being unethical."
Forking from the same chain makes it even more confusing. To the average person that means they're still pretty much the same thing. I have no idea what post you are referring to. Bitcoin.com is deliberately missleading and tells straight up lies about BTC. It also sells its own coin on the website which is extremely unethical. Currency should stay on exchanges.
Hoe please our money is water/fireproof get tf out of here with your flimsy paper money 
"Dude I live in Canada and I have personal experience that this is not true. Had 20 USD in my hand, went to superstore and tried to pay with it. They said no. 

This is only true very close to the US border or at place where you can find a lot of US tourists. Not ""anywhere in Canada"" "
Good luck proving they really lost the coins and don't hold the private keys to them.
I started in 2011
"Obviously, because USD and USC never forked from the same chain. I'm not convinced there are many users who confuse the two just because there was a post on r/bitcoin which is ""totally"" genuine looking."
"Nope he wrote a white paper about Bitcoin. Bitcoin Core is an implementation that used to confirm to the whitepaper. It interacts with a blockchain that uses the BTC ticker.

Basic concepts but it helps to be clear about them."
Hmm nice stuff all in all. 
They're not after their coins. I lost no coins. Nobody lost coins. They are suing because they feel that Roger is deliberately missleading people into buying BCH, because they were under the assumption that it was BTC, and his site has purposefully terrible UI that facilitates the perceived scam. I agree. I have BTC and BCH, as well as LTC ETH XMR.
lol, not quite. It's a little harder to counterfeit though.
"Canadian, and I disagree. You can’t pay *”anywhere”*, but many places (usually chains) will accept USD at a 1:1 ratio. because Americans are willing to literally pay 20% more than be bothered to exchange their money. It’s free money.

Likewise, many places will tell you to fuck off and go to an ATM because they don’t want the hassle of having to convert it themselves.

"
Well selling something under the pretense that’s it’s something different often falls under defrauding laws so....

"**Dollar**

Dollar (often represented by the dollar sign $) is the name of more than twenty currencies, including those of Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Jamaica, Liberia, Namibia, New Zealand, Singapore, Taiwan, and the United States. The U.S. dollar is the official currency of East Timor, Ecuador, El Salvador, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, Palau, the Caribbean Netherlands, and for banknotes, Panama. Generally, one dollar is divided into one hundred cents.

"> If you can download a program from an app store or the internet install it and launch it I don't think you will find that option to purchase BCH or BTC confusing.

Except the average person (who you'll want to adopt BTC/BCH) is probably not smart/informed enough to figure out how everything works with crypto. Thus ""Bitcoin Cash"" vs ""Bitcoin Core"" vs ""Bitcoin Whateverthenextforkiscalled"" is probably confusing to them. If you want people to adopt the version that you're supporting the best way is to inform them vs selling a product on the website about your preferred fork. See /u/snafusaki 's reply to my first comment here."
OK, so it's hard for them to *decide* which is Bitcoin, that's something else. The Core lawsuit makes it look like bitcoin.com is selling counterfeits...
Yep.
"Trademarks can be claimed at any time by anyone willing to defend it.

If some group managing the source wanted, they could have registered a trademark and sent cease and desists or usage agreements to everyone.  But technically one entity or person would have to own it.  So its a hard thing to do with open software.

They would need something like the open source foundation to own and protect it to keep it in safe hands and fair.

But now that there are two competing products using the term bitcoin, it would be very hard to trademark it because random people on both sides would attempt to defend their usage."
Refer to the title of this thread, we were talking about Canadian dollars and American dollars, no one said dollars wasn't it currency in the past, I said dollars wasn't the name of Canadian currency, it's Canadian dollars
"Yea babies are dying guys

"Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin. 

Same genesis block, the same ledger history, 99.999% the same protocol, with a single scalability parameter changed. Everyone with coins before the fork, has the same coins on each side of the fork.

If Bitcoin Core believe they have the better claim because of a label, then they really don't understand Bitcoin. The more attention on this, the better."
Canada is the real America....lol

Trademarks have to be defended, anyone could have nabbed it.  Core didn't defend it and now its a generic term that cannot be trademarked.
Yes! America First, Netherlands Second!!
America hard forked from England lulz
It's been generic since Satoshi put it out there and never registered it himself.  If he intended it to be owned, it would've been.

No it is not. All they need to prove is that the UI is purposefully misleading. It is shit, therefore it is plausible. Every other exchange service has the price and the logo next to it. I do not care what buttcoin says lol
