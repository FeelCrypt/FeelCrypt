"Great writeup! This ""shifting the goal"" exactly fits my experience while I was on Bitcoin Classic. But we don't need to speculate on hidden patents— we can *observe* Blockstream's incentives. Because they are a startup. And startups are dependent on raising money. And to raise money, they boast about their best qualities on their website.

So what does Blockstream boast about? [Here's their website from their 2014 seed round](https://web.archive.org/web/20141031212800/blockstream.com). It makes two key points to investors:

1. Blockstream [is the Bitcoin development team](https://blockstream.com/team/). For investors, this means ""even if their business plan doesn't work, at least they control the $21B currency and can do something with it.""
2. Blockstream makes Sidechains, which is a solution designed for blockchains that cannot change their consensus rules. Read it from Blockstream themselves, in the first paragraph of the [Sidechains PDF](https://web.archive.org/web/20141030184830/http://www.blockstream.com:80/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sidechains.pdf):

> ENABLING BLOCKCHAIN INNOVATIONS with PEGGED SIDECHAINS
>
> By Adam Back, Matt Corallo, Luke Dashjr, Mark Friedenbach, Gregory Maxwell, Andrew Miller, Andrew Poelstra, Jorge Timón, and Pieter Wuille
>
> Abstract
>
> Since the introduction of Bitcoin in 2009, and the multiple computer science and electronic cash innovations it brought, there has been great interest in the potential of decentralised cryptocurrencies. At the same time, **implementation changes to the consensus critical parts of Bitcoin must necessarily be handled very conservatively. As a result, Bitcoin has greater difficulty than other Internet protocols in adapting to new demands and accommodating new innovation.**

In other words, Blockstream's founding technology assumes that Bitcoin is hard to upgrade. If Bitcoin becomes easy to upgrade, their technology is useless. Thus, Blockstream's existence is threatened if either of these situations come to pass:

1. **A different development team influences Bitcoin.** Suddenly, Blockstream can no longer raise money by ""controlling the Bitcoin protocol.""
2. **Bitcoin becomes easy to upgrade.** This means that Sidechains were never actually needed in the first place, and Blockstream won't have a business model.

As a result, it's in Blockstream's interest to oppose any hard-fork that:

1. Gives another development team any power, or
2. Upgrades Bitcoin's features, making Sidechains useless

These are the two reasons that Blockstream ""shifts the goal.""

Rick /u/falkvinge did a great job describing goal-shifting, but their motivation is not patents. **It's that hard-forks threaten their fundraising**. Blockstream raised [$76M](https://blockstream.com/about/#investors) from investors. They have no significant revenue. They are entirely funded by investors. They now have $76M of funding threatened by the possibility of hard-forks that upgrade Bitcoin and introduce new developers. It's in their interest to be hostile to other developers, because then Blockstream employees will be the only Bitcoin developers in town, and they will be able to raise more money. It's in their interest to prevent Bitcoin from improving itself, because then Sidechains might have a business model, and they can raise more money.

I have always appreciated Greg Maxwell's clear writing and creative inventions, starting with his work at Xiph.org, when I first became a fan of his eloquent descriptions of D/A conversion, and extending to CoinJoin and Sidechains. Greg's been a hero of mine. And Pieter Wuille is a brilliant engineer. I hope I get to meet him someday. As a computer scientist, segwit helped me see the light! And HD wallets helped me understand how elegant Bitcoin could be, which I think is a high complement for a mathematician.

But holy cow, has [Greg been a jerk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/63aym5/segwit05mb/dfsy2mh/?utm_content=permalink&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=Bitcoin). Well you know what, so have my other close colleagues, when they are stressed and put under pressure at a startup without a viable business model. But none of my colleagues have raised $76 Million. Holy cow! That must be a lot of pressure. How are you going to make a working business when you have no business model, with $76M on the line? Man, I bet that pressure could turn a person into a real jackass."

"> The patents will be public at some point. But it can take years until that point.

Now you're just repeating Falkvinge's statements. Could you not instead point to how to keep patents secret? For ""years""?

The whole point of patents is that they are public. Otherwise they would be trade secrets. But I'm not a lawyer so I wouldn't be surprised if there are loopholes. Educate me! I would expect them to be jurisdiction dependent however, so any loopholes for keeping US patents secret are probably not valid in other countries, and the other way around.

It's hard to even enforce patents in other jurisdictions, as was recently shown as the US patent for Asicboost turned out to be rather useless for the inventors.

> They might have also patent it under a different name and it might not have been seen by the community.

Again, patents are public. Anyone can query the USPO database for ""Blockstream"" and/or the surnames of prominent employees. It's a small company so it should be trivial. Patents have inventors, applicants and owners registered with the patent office, and they are legally obliged to be legal names otherwise the patent will have no legal standing.

I know I'm being lazy here calling for others to do the search, and I'm sorry about that, but please do the search and spread the knowledge. The community needs to know if there are patents concerning important Bitcoin features."
I think this is not the case. The patent can be hidden only for 12 months in the US, and the patent content must have kept hidden that time. For Segwit it's both not holding: the technology is longer public knowledge (and therefore prior art), and the 12 months are long gone. But there seems to be no segwit patent.
"Wow, Greg in action again... is it so hard to stick to a polite conversation? Why do you always attack everyone personally questioning your motives? Last time you said ""fuck you"" and ""I feel sorry about your family""... Do you think that makes you more trustworthy?"
"PS: I've checked again, US is using ""first-inventor-to-file"", which means in this case, that someone claiming the patent would also have to prove to have it invented before the public segwit development.

But then this brings me to a conspiracy theory of my own ;-) Thinking of the rumors about Craig Wright collecting block chain patents, he could have been running his laughable ""I am Satoshi"" stunt for exactly this reason: he would have needed to prove he was the inventor in order to claim the patent? Not sure if I should end with a /s ;-)

(edit: ridiculing Craig)"
"Yes, but still: segwit is used for about a year now and there was a heated debate. If there was a patent then the patentee would have had to claim his patent already. It there is no patent yet there will be none in future: it can no longer be granted due to prior art.

(edit: spelling)"
Okay, so show me the filing. Once filed they're made public, so this should be super trivial to prove.
"Not the goalpost shifting. They're clearly trying to gain acceptance for some sort of criterion, and throwing all criteria at the wall to try to find one that works.

If they were just driven by ego, they wouldn't give a damn about meeting a goal, they would just expect the world to do as they bid."
"The claim is that with the hypothesis that Blockstream has undisclosed patents covering segwit, your behavior makes sense and without that hypothesis, your behavior doesn't make sense.

That's not a false claim.

You need to supply another explanation for your sequence of nonsensical reasons to prevent a blocksize increase. Otherwise, this explanation makes the most sense and is the one that people will believe.

Nonsense like, ""We can do 2-4-8"", ""We can do segwit+2Mb"", ""Segwit *is* the blocksize increase"", ""Segwit *is* the compromise"" doesn't work because it presumes that we're all idiots who can't see that you're constantly shifting your position and lying your unwiped ass off.

How do you expect us to believe anything you say? Your Patent Pledge Pinky Promise has to be viewed in the light of the Hong Kong agreement. You have made it clear to all of us that your word is worth nothing."
"If this is the case, you should not have any problem with issuing formal, fully transferable licenses for all your patents that could have anything remotely to do with bitcoin to some neutral third parties such as the EFF.

As it stand now, we have to rely on the DPL v 1.1, which requires 

>In order to accept this License, Licensee must qualify as a DPL User (as defined in Section 7.6) and must contact Licensor via the information provided in Licensor’s Offering Announcement to state affirmatively that Licensee accepts the terms of this License.

So no one is covered unless they take specific action in advance...it's also nontransferable. Or we have to rely on your pledge here (https://blockstream.com/about/patent_pledge/) which is dubious as to its legal binding since it is not even accompanied by any signatures, and ends with this gem:

>While we intend for this pledge to be a binding statement, we may still enter into license agreements under individually negotiated terms for those who wish to use Blockstream technology but cannot or do not wish to rely on this pledge alone."
"> How? Who will be sued for patent infringement (for what exactly)? ...and how would that kill Bitcoin?

Presumably in the first instance they'd sue bitcoin companies: bitpay, bitfinex localbitcoins etc for using their patent (by making  bitcoin transactions, and by interpreting the blockchain) without paying the fees blockstream demand. It would be difficult for blockstream to find individuals using bitcoin for private transactions, so theoretically bitcoin might not be killed outright. Most people would move to unencumbered coins though."
"> why not do this if the patents are only intended to preempt patent trolls

There aren't any segwit patents. But any blockstream patents are already available royalty free to everyone who isn't engaging in patent litigation against blocktream or anyone else over blockstream created technology.
"
"Thats the problem though, that ""ANYBODY including core developers can use their patents as long as they don't litigate on these patents."" Is only a company policy that they could revoke at any time, from what I can tell. For there to be legal assurances we'd have to have active, fully transferable licenses held by multiple parties such that those parties could bestow the license rights on anyone blockstream would theoretically sue. I don't see any evidence of these fully transferable licenses currently existing, only that blockstream claims they'd give us some kind of royalty free license if we asked. 

Maybe someone should make a formal request for fully transferable licenses to all blockstream patents that conceivably relate to bitcoin and see how that goes."

For all intents and purposes, SegWit is dead. It's walking dead, it'll be formally dead in approximately six months. And that's going to be interesting. Of course by then Bitcoin will have given up being the majority cryptocurrency (below 50%), and the only question is if it'll be any above 10%.""

there is nothing in segwit you could patent. you could go for patents for the apis, maybe. but thats illusional, to win in the court. (see oracle against google)

so the only method would be to say, we have the copyright, we are the creator of the code and want royalties for the use or are forbidding the use of it.

syscoin, vtc, dgd are running segwit code. how do you explain that they got not sued over not existing patents?

"I've seen this very case.  A first company (which empoyed me at the time) filed patents defensively to protect against legal threats from a large second company.  Then the first company sold the patents to a third company.  Then later, these very patents were used offensively against a fourth company. Like Falkvinge, I've also played the telecommunications standards game and seen how players made their seemingly irrational moves, sometimes with patents showing up. 

I am not going to go into specific details as to the companies involved because of confidentiality agreements that were part and parcel of my employment.  Suffice it to say that I had first hand experience developing a large patent portfolio while employed by the first company and after leaving this employment was eventually hired as a patent consulting by the third company which used my efforts defensively against the second company and then later offensively against the fourth company."

So it sounds like the license doesnt legally apply to anyone who has not made a formal request for the license. Legally it seems you could still sue anyone who has not made a formal license request, which would be most people/organizations.

It also says, 

>""No Sublicensing. This License does not include the right to sublicense any Licensed Patent of any Licensor.""

So the license is not transferrable. Why not grant a formal, fully transferable license to several neutral parties, and then this is all actually legally binding indefinately, without having to have people individually and formally request a license from you in order to be protected, or rely on your pledge?"

"> why would this be at the end of the pledge? ""we may still enter into license agreements under individually negotiated terms for those who wish to use Blockstream technology but cannot or do not wish to rely on this pledge alone.""

Because someone may have some specific requirement that they aren't convinced the pledge covers. It has so far never happened, and we're not aware of what that might be-- but in beta testing the pledge we found that some people presumed it meant we couldn't grant more permissions later, and that text avoids that confusion.

One example where that could come up is that some large companies insist on very specific terms because they've already standardized on those terms-- something I ran into with Microsoft while working on the licenses for Opus.  Rather then them spending time figuring out that our pledge terms are good enough for them, they'd prefer to just use the terms they've standardized on.

> We have-- that is the third part of our program (the IPA).

Thats great but it seems the IPA only applies to those who are listed on the patent application, not neutral third parties. 

Why the resistance to issuing a transferable license directly to the EFF for example? You seem to be dancing around that."

"I think killing bitcoin is a suitable term for the scenario that anyone that uses something segwit related must be at fear of constant lawsuits from patent trolls.

Once segwit is activated, even bitcoin core client might fall under some patents, or even the process of creating a segwit transactio n. Even if nothing important for bitcoins functionality falls under a patent, the fear of lawsuits cripples any innovation or even use that can't afford am army of lawyers to defend themselves. This goes againt all open source spirit that made bitcoin possible."

It could be either filed under another company/individual or the title could have been something that nobody linked to SegWit."

No, patent applications can be kept secret for as long as 18 months, and some patent offices even allow for extension of this time given certain conditions.

That's the thing though, this sounds like it's just a blockstream policy that could change with new management/in a bankrupcy or something. Patent law is tricky business, but it seems to me there might be a difference between a company policy of licenses being ""available royalty free"", and having an actual legal situation whetein those licenses have already been widely distributed.

"""Killed Bitcoin"" is probably too strong a term, but, imagine this: segwit activates. 6 months later there is a hardfork for additional blocksize. Blockstream doesn't like it so they sue jihan and whatever large miners they can identify and claim that the big block hardfork cannot use segwit, only the small block chain they support has their permission to implement segwit. They feel like the hardfork is an attack on bitcoin so their patent use is justified to them. The large block chain already has tons of segwit transactions in it so it can't exactly be rolled back easily to a non-segwit state."

"But what are these patents? Falkvinge says they are ""secret"", but I thought the whole point of patents is that they are public. Is that not so?

There are other things too that I don't understand with this story. If Blockstream holds patents in secret for Segwit for 18 months, why the super conservative activation late 2017 at best? Since the public proposal is from 2015 any patents must already have been taken out by then.

Then the timeline of the story says Blockstream invented Lightning and then segwit to enable Lightning. That is out of touch with reality and unfair to the actual Lightning inventors (who you might remember from being flamed by Blockstream employees for the new extension blocks proposal). They are talented people who worked hard on this for a long time without much recognition, so don't take that away from them.

It's very hard to follow the logic here. If there is any indications there are patents behind segwit, show us the facts right now, so that the community have time to react, either by invalidating them with prior art or working around them before it activates. I believe most of the community would agree that we can not have patented standards here."
SegWit wasn't invented by Bitcoin or the core team . Furthermore it's published using a MIT open source license which would make any patent or claim filed for the patent redundant.
the point is who spends millions and doesn't want an oversized return on investment? My thoughts on why we need both blocksize and segwit.
Its because AXA/bilderberg banks are funding BlockStream and they want control over the protocol and layer 2 solutions.  If they can engineer and patent the layer 2 solutions and force people onto them instead of on-chain scaling they can profit, and also gain control and power.  AXA get enough profit off the too-big-to-fail banker bailout system.  They are interested more in control and power, so they can track and control Bitcoin and team up with governments to track everyone in their [AXA smart cities](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/63i02v/new_video_by_axa_funders_of_blockstream_and_their/).
The U.S. has changed its patent priority from first-to-invent to first-to-file, so it doesn't matter if it was developed in public, not as far as the U.S. patent office is concerned.
In their proposals so far, they are fine with increases as long as it is an increase to SegWit data *only*.
They're stalling for time. Lightning Network is still in development.
"That seems bang on.

The whole ""segwit is a blocksize increase"" argument is a complete pile of shit, because it blissfully ignores the fact that non-segwit transactions get almost no advantage at all, and essentially forces segwit use because of the fee market"
Thank you 
"The DPL is one of [three parallel licensing options](https://blockstream.com/about/patent_faq/) we provide; for additional certainty we wanted to use multiple paths and we support the DPL's efforts.  The DPL is 'revocable' after 180 days notice, but that revocation does not include existing users and our pledge is not revocable.

This is all moot for this discussion, however, because segwit is unpatented."
Has anyone figured out how Blockchain plans to make money?
"Such a situation would definitely work to explain the behavior just as well as patent encumbrance of Blockstream's affecting segwit directly (or indirectly). It also covers the persistent denials that are odd in this situation - if this speculation were completely down the wrong road, I would not expect Blockstream to furiously deny it the way they do.

I can't answer for the stickying, but I'm standing by the observation that the behavior doesn't make sense unless there's patent encumbrance behind it -- which is not the same thing as knowing there are specific patent applications. (For example, the behavior could just as well not make sense anyway.)
The reason for the sticky is that people need to be aware of what is going on. This is a well put together and thought out article which highlights some of the underhanded things Blockstream is doing. 
"Indeed they do. Still, some form of monopolistic encumbrance is the only way I can make sense of this, based on the experience with previous negotiations, the way I describe.

There may be some to-be-discovered edge case where everybody is technically correct (""the best kind of correct"") and which would probably cause a lot of frustration."

"In that case, you know what you can do to neutralise this damaging belief - get Blockstream, all it's associated entities, investors and their associated entities, to provide the developers of -core with a full, transferable, royalty-free license to any and all patents that they might have, or have applied for, that could be read on the use of cryptocurrencies, and then for -core to provide that license to all who download the software.

Unlike a legally questionable pledge, this would actually provide the community with some reassurance. Even here, the worry remains, because they would be sure to put any patents in the hands of entities that they can claim are not 'associated' before providing such a license...."
Can you explain the goal post shifting that has been part of the scaling debate for the last couple of years? Is Blockstream now firmly on the side that the only way to scale Bitcoin is via softforks? 
Then prove it. Prove you have no conflict of interest. Actively support and fight for a simple hard fork blocksize increase option within the Core client. Fight for the users options for a change, and not your pet overly complicated project that is clearly not wanted by the miners. If Segwit is as good as you say it is, people will see this in time, give them time. Hard Fork now Segwit later.  
Thats good to hear blockstream has no patents regarding segwit. Does blockstream have any patents at all? If so where could we view them?
Follow up projects that are patented are not dependent on a segwit activation?
"> As an executive of Blockstream

Haha this is rich, I thought you said [you don't speak for Blockstream](https://i.imgur.com/8gK6lRT.png)?"
"I think there is no chance for patents on segwit. On the one hand side segwit was developed in public so that it is hard to understand how this prior knowledge should become patented at all. On the other hand a patent owner needs to claim his patent, because if he fails to the patent infringement will be ok (see doctrine of laches).

As mentioned before, I think this is a very lame article."
"What about his concern if you go bankrupt or have to sell? Do those patents remain defensive if ownership changes?

Is there anything legally binding about this pledge? Why would we expect you to follow it?"
This seems like a nice clear destription of Blockstream's likely motives. Even with the best intentions, its hard to be objective when you have such a clear conflict of interests.
Makes sense.
"This is a great writeup. This is a point I hadn't considered before:

>Let’s assume good faith here for a moment, and that Greg Maxwell and Adam Back of Blockstream really don’t have any intention to use patents offensively, and that they’re underwriting the patent pledge with all their personal credibility.
It’s still not worth anything.
In the event that Blockstream goes bankrupt, all the assets – including these patents – will go to a liquidator, whose job it is to make the most money out of the assets on the table, and they are not bound by any promise that the pre-bankruptcy management gave.
Moreover, the owners of Blockstream may — and I predict will — replace the management, in which case the personal promises from the individuals that have been replaced have no weight whatsoever on the new management. If a company makes a statement to its intentions, it is also free to make the opposite statement at a future date, and is likely to do so when other people are speaking for the company."
"There is one point I do not understand.

If they had patents in Segwit, wouldn't it be in their intrest to force it no matter the cost (ie. blocksize)? Why would they push for the 1mb blocksize limit so much then? I mean, if they delivered Segwit along with the 2mb fork, wouldn't they get more support? Wouldn't it be still a better option for them, since it's their win anyway and without all that trouble? It seems to me their clear interest is forcing sidechains and LN through limiting the blocksize AND forcing Segwit. They seem to crave for both. Forcing Segwit is just one of the checkpoints along the way which is as much important as limiting the blocksize. Doesn't seem like Segwit is the great goal (which it would be, or at least would be way more important than whether the blocksize is 1 or 2 mb if they had patents)"

>t1_d9x1yceWell, there we have it folks, Blockstream is playing the Bitcoin community like a fucking fiddle right now, and all his cronies are playing along. FYI, these published patents were lodged 18 months ago!! That is if this is in line with the American patent system. So, soon after Blockstream was formed, they've been scrambling to lock down every single piece of intellectual property they can get their hands on, and since CORE has been employed since Blockstream was formed, that means EVERY SINGLE PIECE OF IP PRODUCED BY THEM BELONGS TO BLOCKSTREAM TOO, SegWit, Lightning, whatever else they have waiting in the wings. All theirs.
I believe a slow clap is in order.
THIS is why they've fought tooth and nail to prevent a blocksize increase, and if SegWit had been deployed in time, they'd have fucked the miners, and the entire community by being able to completely control, WHO, and HOW Seg Wit transactions can be used. Don't worry your pretty little heads people, there's almost certainly a SW patent already lodged.

>Yep, if SW pans out, then there really should be no issue with including it. Gavin has already voiced his approval, and I think Mike would likely have no objection either. **My only concern, is that people will try and use this optimisation as an argument to justify stalling action on raising the blocksize yet again**. I know there are going to be small blockers that will scream loudly that we don't need to rush because SW will buy more time etc. etc. . I'm fully against SW as a justification to stall, or play the wait and see game, as it still doesn't address the problem in the long term. We still need a schedule to raise the block size which is going to accomodate an increase in growth over the long term.

You've been fucking played Bitcoin community, you've been played big time. So the real question is, what the fuck is everyone going to do about it now that it's crystal clear Bitcoin as a POW payment system is precipitously close to losing not only it's first mover advantage, but also losing even the ability to function as a payment network?

Blockstream is bent on market capture, not helping Bitcoin. They are a *for profit* entity, nobody should forget that.

>>What do you think changed in the community to get us to this position?

>Hmmm, hard to say without naming names ;). I will say that the lightning network probably had a lot to do with how devs are now doubling down their resistance to the block increase. Much like sidechains could do away with the necessity for altcoins, LN could do something similar with the blocksize. I think that is simply false hope though and devs just don't want to accept the fact that Bitcoin needs to scale up sooner than they feel ready to. In years previous it was claimed that removing the block would be abused and lead to blockchain bloat (which never happened, as other mechanisms kept it in check), then it was that we need to force fee markets (AKA fee pressure) into existence to ensure miners don't abandon the network (which also never happened). Now they are claiming that LN is the holy grail of avoiding the need for removing the blocksize limit (at least for the time being) and will solve everyone's problems and to do otherwise will centralise nodes/mining or something else.
There seems to be this perpetual fear that allowing blocks to get bigger will be abused and cause the network to converge to a more centralised version of what it is now, which in turn will lead to it being more insecure, more easily cut off/dismantled, and more easily traceable. That seems to be the main crux of it. I think what we are seeing is certain agitators are leveraging this fear to make their case that block increases must be avoided to avoid this outcome, even though there is ample evidence to prove that Bitcoin is more than capable of handling greater transaction loads, and nodes will not disappear. Because centralisation is the boogey man for nearly all Bitcoin developers, it gets their attention, and even implausible scenarios start to get treated very seriously. The problem is that these agitators don't need to prove that it will happen, they only need to suggest that it might happen. And I don't necessarily think they are saying these things because they believe them, there is a strong likelihood that devs with very strong libertarian views are more concerned about possible erosion of privacy, or they hate the idea of not being able to run full nodes in the future because they are too paranoid to trust anything less.**AHEM It could also be that VC money is on the line and a small blocksize would boost support for their services/development in the future**.

"I'd say this is the best explanation I've seen so far.

When BU inevitably replaces core I predict Blockstream will take to patent trolling."
"Brilliant analysis, I think this is exactly what is happening.

Let's stand up and fight for honesty and a decentralized future of Bitcoin!"
"I feel EXACTLY the same way. Great article. My bullshit detector has been firing nonstop about blockstream and patents.

Here's a bit more on why their ""defensive patent pledge"" (aka ""DPL"") is meaningless:

1) They can cancel it with 180 days notice, and all of the affected patents become unencumbered by the licensing agreement

2) The ""pledge"" component of blockstream's blog post is not a patent licensing contract and does not encumber their IP in any way

3) The ""DPL"" is fully revokable!

All blockstream needs to do is a) convince current management to withdraw the pledge; or, b) have the board of directors (which we now know is [NOT made up of ""core developers"" as promoted](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1621139/000162113914000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml)) to vote and REPLACE the current management and then withdraw from the DPL.

4) The DPL only applies to other companies that took the DPL. 

This currently applies to... just the internet archive and one individual. No real large fortune 500 company would ever join the DPL because they would forfeit their patent portfolio temporarily and risk any company joining the DPL getting a free license to it.

So the current management, or a new management determined by the board can simply have a ""do-over"" on the DPL pledge. Blockstream can do this on a whim, and this DPL ""do-over"" can and will very much be part of any acquisition by AXA or another large incumbent.

DUMP CORE people. Say no to SegWit."
Perhaps the patents existed before the invention of Bitcoin, or at least before the creation of Blockstream.  Those patents are owned by a separate company to Blockstream,  but also owned by AXA and or other investors. That would explain things as well.  This is pure speculation on my part although there are claims that [existing patents](https://patents.google.com/patent/US6507656B1/en) already cover segwit. 
This is interesting speculation, but without any hard evidence, I don't think this should be stickied. It makes /r/btc look bad.

"I was working on Bitcoin related stuff over the weekend and had to dig deeper into BIP32/BIP39/BIP44 and BIP70/BIP71/BIP72.  I had a Wikipedia-esque moment where you just start following links and reading random stuff.  Made me forget about the block size issue, the patents, etc and made me proud of the technological marvel that is cryptocurrency.

The main moment was as I was implementing BIP44.  It's one seed phrase for every Bitcoin-originated coin.  You type in ""correct horse battery stapler"" and you have access to all of your Bitcoin, Litecoin, Namecoin, Dogecoin, WhateverCoin in a predictable and agreeable manner.

No one patented ""a mechanism by which to derive unique parent/child keys organized by coin type"" and then provided a license to add your coin with a gentleman's agreement that it would be royalty free.

"
Great article! If Blockstream has good intent they should donate the patents and make it as a public good.
"This is stupid. There is no such thing as a secret patent- once a patent is files it's public, and before it's public it isn't a granted patent. If segwit comes out before they file for the patents (which would have to be the case since segwit is already out and the author admits he couldn't find any patents) then the patents would be invalidated due to prior art.

As long as shit like this keeps getting upvoted and treated as truth this sub will be just as lost as the other one."
 Bitcoin can't be stopped.  No patent can do shit.  Quit with the conspiracy theories.
This makes sense - also does not bode well for the public 
They deny having such patents 
"Fantastic writeup! I had not considered this aspect of hidden patent agenda.

By the way, scroll down to the comments section after the article. You'll find a discussion between Gregory Maxwell and Rick Falkvinge.

------------------

To play devil's advocate, I have a question for you /u/falkvinge:

if Blockstream (or their owners) wanted to get these patents in place so badly, why wouldn't they simply implement the 2MB blocksize increase along with Segwit? That way Segwit would be in place as quickly as possible, with as little resistance as possible (Since both sides would be more in favor of this, as well as Chinese miners who agreed to HK agreement).

But instead, we have Blockstream refusing to do any sort of on-chain blocksize increase. In light of your article, why might that be? What might their logic be here?"
"1st point:
wait. open source software license - you can view the code, you can use it under free license, once its released under free license - you cant change that point.

even they patent something, they cant get royalties or forbid the use. 

2nd point:
whats wrong about AXA supporting bitcoin development? its getting open source, so everyone can use it. 

most every bitcoiner was dreaming some years ago of banks taking bitcoin serious and invest money into development"
"Blockstream does not have any patents, patent applications, provisional patent applications, or anything similar, related to segwit. Nor, as far as anyone knows does anyone else. As is the case for other major protocol features, the Bitcoin developers worked carefully to not create patent complications. Segwit was a large-scale collaboration across the community, which included people who work for Blockstream among its many contributors.

Moreover, because the public disclosure of segwit was more than a year ago, we could not apply for patents now (nor could anyone else).

In the prior thread where this absurdity was alleged on Reddit I debunked it forcefully. Considering that Rick directly repeated the tortured misinterpretation of our [patent pledge](https://blockstream.com/about/patent_pledge.html) from that thread (a pledge which took an approach that was lauded by multiple online groups), I find it hard to believe that he missed these corrections, doubly so in that he provides an incomplete response to them as though he were anticipating a reply, when really he’d already seen the rebuttal and should have known that there was nothing to these claims.

As an executive of Blockstream and one of the contributors to segwit, my straightforward public responses 1) that we do not, have not, will not, and can not apply for patents on segwit, 2) that if had we done so we would have been ethically obligated to disclose it, and 3) that even if we had done so our pledge would have made it available to everyone not engaging in patent aggression (just as the plain language of our pledge states): If others depended upon these responses, it would create a reliance which would preclude enforcement by Blockstream or our successors in interest even if the statements were somehow all untrue–or so the lawyers tell me.

In short, Rick Falkvinge’s allegations are entirely without merit and are supported by nothing more than pure speculation which had already been debunked."
How do you recognise a conspiracy theory? By looking for claims that are impossible to verify or refute. The scientific method. /u/Falkvinge claims that there are hidden Segwit patents, and when /u/nullc objected that there aren't any, /u/Falkvinge complains that /u/nullc hasn't provided a proof. /u/Falkvinge is a conspiracy theorist. Sadly, I used to think highly of him, but it looks like, as I worried in my recent article, the scaling debate is causing people to go full retard. This is doubly sad, because it prevents productive work.
I would rate this as likely. It is, once again, a follow the money situation.
Excellent post, this is what I have been suspecting as well.  AXA funded BlockStream Core are dirty players.  They want technocratic control over Bitcoin, so they can team up with governments to track and control everybody for their [AXA's technocratic smart cities](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/63i02v/new_video_by_axa_funders_of_blockstream_and_their/).
This article is so spot on it's not even funny. How anyone can deny the attempted takeover by Core and their shifting goalposts at this point is beyond me. It's just people being willfully ignorant. It's nice hearing it from someone who has experience in technical development and who can recognize patterns like this.
"> When us technical experts in the room pointed out how the argument made no sense, they would repeat that feature X should absolutely use mechanism Y, but now based on a completely new rationale, which didn’t make any sense either.

This is exactly what they've been doing. To a staggering amount I might add.

But nonetheless to believe they are completely lying when they say they don't have patents would require extraordinary evidence that we don't have.  I don't think you can do anything but take them at their word at this point. "

Citation? I am pretty sure most people were saying that the node count was easily sibyl attacked, not that it does not matter

There seems to be a lot of theories and paraphrasing in OPs post but no facts"
"I think it's a very lame story:

* There exists a grace period for patents in some countries, in the US it's 12 months. If there was a patent it would be visible now.
* Even if there was an application it wouldn't be granted, because the technical details were already public knowledge (prior art)

I'd expect more from Rick."
Wow, you are on here fast in the middle of the night for damage control.. Did you get an emergency memo from the [Dragon's Den](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/63yr6x/inside_the_dragons_den_bitcoin_cores_troll_army/)? You attacked Craig Wright for his patents, its so hypocritical you defend BlockStream patents.
If tps doubles, price might quadruple. Makes fiat look even worse. Just my two cents.
"> killed Bitcoin

How? Who will be sued for patent infringement (for what exactly)? ...and how would that kill Bitcoin?  

Edit: it's just FUD, see Greg's response:

[Blockstream does not have any patents, patent applications, provisional patent applications, or anything similar, related to segwit. As is the case for other major protocol features, the Bitcoin developers worked carefully to not create patent complications. Segwit was a large-scale collaboration across the community, which included people who work for Blockstream among its many contributors.](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/68kflu/blockstream_having_patents_in_segwit_makes_all/dgz8q71/)"
right, and the segwit vs block size argument seems just a ploy to force segwit through as the block size increase solution (segwit has nothing to do with block size, and is a rediculous solution for increasing block size, and like you said is just for segwit transactions). 
Even if segwit is unpatented, you may have or intend to have patents on tech which requires a malleability fix before it can be deployed.
"The patents would not be on segwit, which is just a regular bip. Their patents would not be filed yet, and would be on proprietary off-chain / lightning networks from blockstream.

blockstream just needs 2 things right now...

 * segwit - to solve malleability so they can implement lighting and their patented channels
 * no block size increase - to force transactions off-chain due to a full main chain
"
"The patents will be public at some point. But it can take years until that point. During this time you can't know anything about the patent.

They might have also patent it under a different name and it might not have been seen by the community.

Sometimes it is not clear immediately what a patent really covers and what the implications are. It is very hard even to know for what to search."
If 'no patent can do shit' why all the drama around asicboost? 
yeah by that standard Falkvinge patented emergent consensus, xthin and flexible transaction... let me Google transaction and patent see what comes up!!
"It's not so bad to spend your time reading patents, providing you are being paid big bucks by the hour and can earn more in a few hours reading patents than you could in an entire day herding cats as a technical manager or writing code as a nerd.  That's at least true until you finally realize that you are now making the world a worse place, because you are helping entrenched companies further entrench their monopolies.
"
"> Then the timeline of the story says Blockstream invented Lightning and then segwit to enable Lightning. That is out of touch with reality and unfair to the actual Lightning inventors

Specifically Falkvinge had Blockstream say

> We’ve come up with this Segwit package to enable the Lightning Network.

The confusion arises because the term 'segwit' is used to refer to two different things. The first is the idea to exclude witness data from the blockchain and the second is a particular implementation of that idea by core with specific memory limits, soft fork design etc."
You are a member of the nefariously named [Dragon's Den](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/63yr6x/inside_the_dragons_den_bitcoin_cores_troll_army/) where Core colludes for propaganda troll campaigns right?? Just thought people should be aware of your bias.
"What do you think about this point, specifically?

>Let’s assume good faith here for a moment, and that Greg Maxwell and Adam Back of Blockstream really don’t have any intention to use patents offensively, and that they’re underwriting the patent pledge with all their personal credibility.
It’s still not worth anything.
In the event that Blockstream goes bankrupt, all the assets – including these patents – will go to a liquidator, whose job it is to make the most money out of the assets on the table, and they are not bound by any promise that the pre-bankruptcy management gave.
Moreover, the owners of Blockstream may — and I predict will — replace the management, in which case the personal promises from the individuals that have been replaced have no weight whatsoever on the new management. If a company makes a statement to its intentions, it is also free to make the opposite statement at a future date, and is likely to do so when other people are speaking for the company."
All the more reason not to have segwit, imo
To raise a level of abstraction, patents are just a means to prevent others to use your technology. From this point of view, segwit itself is already enough to prevent others to manipulate bitcoin code since its very complicated structure will make it very difficult for new coders to work on it thus purely dependent on BS's guidance. This is enough to ensure a coding monopoly in bitcoin
only if segwit is implemented
"I'm guessing they'll point to an IPA agreement, an ""Innovators Patent Agreement"". However, I can't find any reference to an IPA actually being tested in a courtroom, as it's a rather new idea from Twitter. And even if an IPA proves to hold up in court, the company only has to get permission from the inventer (which in this case is often very likely adam or greg themselves) in order to legally use it offensively. Besides that the line between offensive and defensive could be pretty murky depending on the language used in the IPA."
I seem to be missing some context. Which persistent denials are you referring to?
Software license is copyright, not patent.
"> This is exactly what they've been doing. To a staggering amount I might add.

It goes back before the official founding of Blockstream, all the way back to early 2013.

None of the arguments against a block size limit increase have ever made sense.

No matter how many times we refute their arguments, they just switch to different ones (which also make no sense).

The fact that their arguments make no sense, and that the opponents of a block size limit are not arguing in good faith, has been well-established for four years now.

If Bitcoin is made up of people who are willing to follow people who be brazenly lie to them for years at a time, knowing full well they are being lied to, then it's hard to say that Bitcoin deserves to survive at all."
"Bill Clinton: ""I did not have any sexual affair with Monika Lewinski""

They are programmers, nerds, IT guys. But they have no clue about economics, and even less communication and social skills.
"> I base this not on having read the actual patents, **for they can be kept secret for quite some time;** "
"Well, I'm not arguing from the point of ""there's no proof of the opposite and therefore my claim must be true"".

I'm arguing from the point of ""I've seen this pattern many times before"", and therefore not backing my assertion with any kind of verifiable claim, rather just relating an experience.

I would argue there's a difference.

You'll also note that the headline isn't ""Blockstream has patents in segwit"", but ""If Blockstream has patents in segwit, then all this weird behavior makes perfect sense"".

But you're right on one point: the toxicity of this affects us all. "
"**How to shape a false narrative**

Step 1) Control the flow of information (through censorship and misinformation)

Step 2) Label anyone that disagrees or points out the obvious flaws in the misinformation you're trying to spread as a 'conspiracy theorist' or 'fakenews'"
The precise lawyerly English used in your post does not match with that of the real /u/nullc we know from the past. 
Nice, clear rebuttal.
"I'm not sure how anyone can give them the benefit of the doubt at this point. They have both actively participated in smear campaigns and spread lies over and over, whatever it takes to get their way. In the words of Andreas, Maxwell in particular ""is a cowardly weasel, through and through.""
"
They're also bad guys.
"When one talks about natural law, e.g. a physical law, the presumption is that theories that are impossible to test have no meaning.  However, this argument is not valid when dealing with humans, whom we all know concoct secret plans and often carry them out using multiple people from time to time.  (How do we know this?  Introspection.  Start with our own thoughts and deeds.  Who can honestly say he hasn't conspired to do something other people wouldn't like, even it it wasn't a crime?)  

A little study of history, not to mention reading spy novels, will show that the powers behind the scenes employ cut outs and other means to ensure that it is difficult to prove their involvement.  This is called ""plausible deniability.""   This is very easy to do when governments carry out bad deeds, such as political assassinations. Bear in mind that the terms ""conspiracy theory"" and ""conspiracy theorist"" were terms created by the CIA to discredit people who were getting close to exposing some of their black operations.  The ""scientific"" method may work when dealing with atoms and molecules, but it can be very lame when dealing with dishonest smart people.

Your post can be taken as evidence that **you** may be part of the conspiracy, albeit a sock puppet identity or a lowly shill.
