Monero had last month. They are natural part of monero, so people just got used to them and no drama so far. 
Agreed. Although the final story is not in. In case you haven't noticed, we have a major hard fork coming November 18 that could wipe out both SW chains causing a huge rush into BCH as a safe haven. Markets also have this nasty habit of doing head fakes to kill off as many investors as possible on the way up. BCH at 317 and holding. Pretty damn good for a 1.5 month old. 
"Except there is, this is about the only sub where people want another hard fork for bitcoin.

Personally I would rather see what lightning network does for bitcoin before the block size is increased, especially when the upgrade hasnt even been completed and tested less than 1 month from the fork.

The EDA is directly profitable for miners, and there is certainly a contigent of the BCH community who will go along with them if they want to keep it. There have been many threads on this very sub arguing that it doesn't need improving.
Yes, I know that people opposed Segwit it *even* as a softfork. That doesn't weaken my point, strengthens it rather.
"Thats a much better post, thanks.

Now the discussion can be about if it should be in bitcoin or not, but I dont really have a preference or the technical background about this to have an informed opinion.

"> the soft fork can never be undone

You can undo it with a hardfork. The HF would forbid output to new SW addresses, but it would still enable spending of existing SW outputs.

> unupgraded clients see them as valid transactions

Miners using old nodes can produce invalid blocks. This is not a problem. If you are mining, you better update the software, and then there is no risk. If you are not a miner, it doesn't matter what you node believe.

> if you try and undo the fork later on, then old segwit transactions can be spent by anyone transacting within that same block

Even if you disable creation of new SW outputs, there is no reason to also enable anyone-can-spend again. Why would you do that?"
Empty argument, no correlation.  This hard fork will be on the BTC chain with no replay protection and there will only be one winner.
"> Technologies like LN do not need to implement anything ON bitcoin, so no consensus is needed on that.

Yes you are technically correct, the issue is infrastructure needs to be built and it won't be unless there is a pressing need. If it's easier to just transact on-chain, no wallet would build L2 interfacing - until it's too late.


>I can not understand how it's too much attention that can not be handled.

The power of exponential growth. Bitcoin's growth exponent is far larger than hardware growth exponent. It was kicked off too soon, and Bitcoin simply cannot handle world's transactions on-chain, being a gossip network where every node knows of every single transaction ever made. It needs to offload these off-chain, with the off-chain operating with the same underlying tokens, and where every node doesn't need to know every single transaction in Bitcoin universe. This is what LN attempts to do."
"Bitcoin was designed to be contentious. That's one of its best traits.

"The idea of ""code as law"" has no backing. The entire point of blockchain is **consensus**, not immutability. If everyone in the system agrees to remove something from the blockchain, then it's completely valid, because blockchains aren't about immutability, they're about coming to consensus and agreeing about the state of the blockchain.

I'd agree if the funds were just lost due to user error, but weren't. Someone straight up stole them. We wouldn't put up with that anywhere else in the world, so why would we let a malicious party get away with it on a blockchain? It's not because ""blockchains are immutable!"", because that is **not** the point of blockchains.

> rather than our present system of ""justice"", which ultimately is enforced by guns and nuclear bombs, despite all the blather about democracy.

In this case, ""justice"" was enforced by a direct democracy. There were no guns or nuclear bombs. The majority of people agreed that the thief didn't deserve what they took and that letting the thief keep what they stole would destroy the Ethereum ecosystem, so the majority undid the actions of the malicious party. A minority did decide that the thief earned what he got, which is completely valid and is the reason ETC took <10% of the hashing power. I'm completely fine with ETC existing, but they have <10% the tx volume/market cap for a reason."
"> Some Core supporters believe small blocks are integral...

Here is the problem. Why can only *they* determine what is a ""small block""? There were discussions allowing blocks up to 1GB or higher. One of the simplest plans was a one time increase to 20MB, so even SegWit2x where people are pulling out their hair and jumping off bridges is *way* smaller than that. SegWit2x is very small to people who believe blocks should be unlimited.

Then there is the other side of the question. Why is 1-4MB not too big?? What if some people think blocks should be much smaller than that? (Yes, actually some people DO believe that). Why is it that only Core can say EXACTLY what is small and what is big? The truth is they can't. They're just stubborn and unwilling to work reasonably with others. THAT is the real problem.

"There was nothing new in that.   It claims that Bitcoin is only valuable as a new asset class to replace gold, and for a variety of reasons pushing Bitcoin to a $7.5B valuation is a terrible idea.

""Truly useful"" to me means as a new substrate for transactions, able to replace a very substantial fraction of transactions.  Bitcoin both don't have the scaling technology, and have a basic structure that is in the way of this (the mining payout structure set up is in the way, and confirmations are *way* too slow.)

I think it is possible for a different coin to grow to actually work for this, though nobody has released one with the appropriate properties.  I don't think it is possible for Bitcoin to grow to do this.

In what way do you consider Bitcoin ""truly useful""?  To me, it seems to have ended up primarily a speculative asset with a bubble structure, and to a small degree something that is used to facilitate some small amount of international money transfers and trade that's otherwise illegal.

"Okay, first lets dispel this myth that blockstream controls core. It does not. The [last core release](https://bitcoin.org/en/release/v0.15.0.1) had over 90 contributors from all over the globe, with almost all of them having no affiliation with blockstream. The lead maintainer, Wladimir J. van der Laan, who ultimately decides what changes get merged, also does not work for blockstream. You can not provide any reasonable evidence that blockstream controls core, particularly for their own benefit, at the expense of the users. It's a silly conspiracy theory.

Second, a hard fork, specifically for a capacity increase, is literally in the scaling roadmap. So how is it that either core or blockstream (however you wish to conflate the two) is against a hard fork when [over 60 core contributors have endorsed it](https://bitcoincore.org/en/2015/12/21/capacity-increase/)?

"I do not believe that the corporate 2x attack will succeed.  Just like BCH, it has no economic relevancy.

Even if the majority of miners decide to create this fork (highly doubtful), they will all switch to whichever chain earns them the most revenue.

Since it doesn't have an EDA style bribery scheme built in, it won't be able to attract miners at all.

"> but the AsicBoost thing needs to be fixed,

Asicboost is a relative nonissue.  Despite the claim that it is being used and was blocking segwit, no one has been able to find any statistical evidence that it was ever used.  In fact Maxwell claimed a very specific use of asicboost was prevented by asicboost and therefore was why segwit was being blocked.  I wrote a script that searched across many thousands of blocks for evidence of that specific use and came up with nothing.

Segwit doesn't fix asicboost, it only makes the specific merkle-branch swapping method that Greg suggested was being used un-viable.  I also couldn't find any other evidence of asicboost being used.

Fixing asicboost requires a hardfork.  The segwit2x team has already had discussions on how to fix it in a proper hardfork (later date), and Bitmain already gave their consent for asicboost to be fixed as an olive branch to bring the community together.  Naturally, Core ignored the olive branch.

"The philosophy behind Etherum's smart contracts was that the system allowed ""code to be law"".  What happened showed nothing more than mob rule.  If the bug had been in Ethereum itself then it would have been reasonable for the bug in Ethereum to be fixed.  But that's not what happened.  The bug was in the ""contract"" and all the people who lost signed on to the contract.   If they were fools, then they deserved to lose their funds. 

What I saw was that the people in charge of Ethereum did not believe in their own philosophy.  And worse, when they violated their philosophy they did this for their own personal benefit.

It would have been, IMO, a wonderful thing if all those funds had been lost.  It would have made it crystal clear that there was a future for smart contracts and ""code as law"" rather than our present system of ""justice"", which ultimately is enforced by guns and nuclear bombs, despite all the blather about democracy.

"> Really how a decentralised dev could have forced a contentious soft fork?

You get a portion of the miners (even a minority thereof) to orphan rather than extend the last block if-and-only-if it didn't follow the stricter rules (the softfork).

This has a chance of incentivizing everyone to follow the stricter rules, because if they didn't it would increase the chances of getting their blocks orphaned. 

Different devs can even try to convince different fractions of miners of doing the same with different and perhaps mutually incompatible softfork ideas. And the miners would vote with their hashpower by orphaning or extending blocks. :-)

This differs from a hardfork, because hardforks are a loosening of the rules. Orphaning blocks that *aren't* as strict wouldn't work unless you already had a majority of the hashpower, and then it automatically leads to a split chain, not a gradual conversion of the chain."

It's hard enough maintaining backward compatibility while upgrading the network without a second version locking things in.  If the second version screwed up, the user experience would reflect badly on both, although it would at least reinforce to users the importance of staying with the official version.  If someone was getting ready to fork a second version, I would have to air a lot of disclaimers about the risks of using a minority version.  This is a design where the majority version wins if there's any disagreement, and that can be pretty ugly for the minority version and I'd rather not go into it, and I don't have to as long as there's only one version.

"> People opposed SegWit because it was sold as something it was not

So the people who are e.g. saying that it will cause everyone to lose their coins, that it's unsafe, etc, etc, would have supported it if not for the *marketing*?

I somehow doubt it. But even if that was true, that's a point in favour of Segwit (nothing wrong with Segwit, just with how it was it was sold) and against its opponents (who focus on the idiotic marketing, rather than whether the technology itself is good or bad)."
But the reality is that bitcoin doesnt have ice age still, so you cant compare. Its trivially true that if bitcoin had a better hardfork system, it would be easier to implement hardforks. But it doesnt have that.
There is no correlation because Bitcoin Cash was a planned hard fork with replay protection that did not go for the BTC ticker.  That is exactly the opposite of what will happen in a month.  Segwit2x will upgrade BTC and there is nothing you can do to stop it.
"And yet you still can't fucking dispute a single word I said. Feast on FACTS, you asshole. Satoshi supported having one official version. Satoshi said he'd discourage a non-official version.

And just to make you stew in your rabid insanity some more: Satoshi limited blocksize to 1 MB by himself, without any interest in discussing this decision with others, not with other developers, not with miners. And what's the process he gave for increasing the blocksize? Why he himself increasing it in the code, without again any input from others.

So much for his supposed love of 'decentralized development'. So much for mining hashpower getting a vote."
Yeah, instead of having a dozen Core developers working independently of the miners, you want a single Segwit2x developer that has been hired by the miners. That's 'decentralization' according to you.
I don't have an issue with sticking with a majority version of the code. That has nothing to do with what you just claimed, however, which was having a centralized dev team like Blockstream Core. Logic much? 
If this is the extent of your argument, it only serves as further evidence of how much a joke this subreddit is.
"> You love to make it sound like 2x only involves the major merchants and miners.

I'm not ""making it sound like that"", that's just reality.  

> You totally try to sweep under the rug that they have the full support of the big block community and the thousands who have been banned in r/Bitcoin

Ok, so the same community that supports BCH?  I'm not too concerned.  That's an insignificantly small number of users that don't represent a large economic position.

> That futures market is another demo of corruption at bitfinex. It's biased.

People like you just need a way to justify in your head why the BT2 token is trading at such a low price.  So you come up with fictitious ways in which it must be ""biased"".  It's called cognitive dissonance.  You can't simultaneously believe that the 2x fork is going to succeed, but also see that the price is trading so low.  So you concoct a fantasy scenario in which the BT2 token must be biased.  It's kind of funny.

The reality is that the [token constraints are not biased at all](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/763c5q/the_official_ticker_for_bcore_altcoin_has_been/dob67hf/).  The reason why the price is so low is because no one wants 2x.

> Depending on the state of BTC after the fork, they may represent the best of all BCH hodlers. 

The BCH price can't be improved by Coinbase releasing their millions of BCH tokens.  Right now, all of those tokens are essentially being ""held"", as you put it, the ""best of all BCH holders"".  Once Coinbase releases them, at least some of those people will sell.  So the price can only go down.  The only way this scenario doesn't affect the price of BCH is if every single Coinbase BCH recipient continues to hold, without exception.  I think we both realize how unlikely that is.

So the question simply becomes, how many of these new BCH tokens will get dumped on the exchanges?  Only time will tell."

So if you mean bandwidth, how much would LN need to be able to send status changes to each node and how does it compare to sending transactions?

They were also the ones who introduced the term ""contentious"" to the scene, accusing all new implementations of it. Remember when they started slinging around the term ""contentious"" like crazy, starting with XT when it was gaining momentum? That's when it began. I had never heard the term in the Bitcoin space before that moment. Then it was like wildfire.

Blockstream, in cahoots with theymos, divided the community with censorship by utilizing theymos' control over discussion platforms, and then *manufactured the rift* between the two sides which they then pointed at in cries of ""contentiousness"". **They created the contentiousness.**

It was all fabricated by one group. I hope we expel them soon.

I think when they are gone and (if) their censorship is no more, both sides can come together once again. But that will require the manufactured and continually upheld rift between both sides to be dissolved. Again: one company is creating this situation. Blockstream. Their name was very aptly chosen."
The only people making it contentious is Blockstream/Core for no logical reasons. That's why they are getting fired so there will be no more contention.

I think it is true in ethereum's case that it can be hard forked to be upgraded. It is not as true with Bitcoin because of the insanity of that team. Another negative factor toward hard forking Bitcoin is the religious zealotry of the user base. And they tend to be fractious. Bitcoin lacks a strong leader. Say what you want about that being a good thing in the interest of decentralisation. Strong leaders are helpful in any initiative if they are good at what they do.
No one says hard forks don't work. We just don't want or need one right now for Bitcoin. 
"BlockstreamCore is walking a tightrope. They want people to use LN and future sidechains they've developed, which means pushing users off-chain by artificially limiting capacity. At the same time, both the  LN hub and sidechain networks require larger blocks to work at scale. Without larger blocks they are insecure, overly expensive and users won't want to use them.

This is why they've been so controlling. They want to force users off-chain FIRST and keep them there, and then afterward allow on-chain transactions only for on-boarding people into their privatized network. It's centralization and corruption at its worst. Bitcoin used to be an open source project and BlockstreamCore has tried to hijack it."

Bitcoin was supposed to also. Satoshi provided the sample code for how to do a hard fork prior to blocks becoming full. This was averted by the company Blockstream.

Unfortunately to answer this I would need to come up with numbers, which I can't.

>To clarify, I think that a node in bitcoin is only for companies

I'd say LN nodes are (mostly) going to be run by companies, rarely by users. Although anyone can have one provided they have sufficient capital to lock up in contracts. Bitcoin itself, however, needs to preserve the ability for high-end user-grade hardware to run actual nodes to ensure decentralization."
"> Unfortunately to answer this I would need to come up with numbers, which I can't.

Then why do you say ""One is significantly less resource intensive than the other""?

> Bitcoin itself, however, needs to preserve the ability for high-end user-grade hardware to run actual nodes to ensure decentralization

Why that difference in the two to achieve decentralization?"
"> ""One is significantly less resource intensive than the other""?

Because the transactions are spread on a need-to-know basis? Intuitively less traffic.

Sorry I can't give a better answer.

>Why that difference in the two to achieve decentralization?

Preserves the base layer decentralization. Higher centralization on top layer is really not as important as keeping the sanctity of the base layer."
"> Because the transactions are spread on a need-to-know basis

I do not understand what you mean

> Higher centralization on top layer is really not as important as keeping the sanctity of the base layer.

Your argument is that LN does not need as much decentralization as bitcoin, but at the same time you think LN is necessary for bitcoin to be usable as currency. For me that is contradictory, if LN or other second layer technology is an important part of the use of bitcoin then it needs the same level of decentralization."
"I don't know how much network traffic the LN network will need to function (know the status of other LN nodes), but I do know that transaction traffic on both L1 and L2 would be a small fraction of what it would be if it wasn't for L2, given that L2 doesn't need to broadcast every transaction to all nodes.

>if LN or other second layer technology is an important part of the use of bitcoin then it needs the same level of decentralization.

Edited to 'alternative proposal' before you posted, because it's not my point whether Segwit is good or bad, my point is that Satoshi wasn't around to support or oppose it, which is what led to the conflict and the stalling.

Sample ice age code? Source?
Go the Facebook othereum
Yes the change made by segwit would have been trivial to implement as an HF.
The SegWit implementation was planned in two steps. First as a softfork, and then as a hardfork. The advantage of first doing it as a softfork was that you didn't need to do the header refactoring at the same time (which would add more complexity to the fork). This header refactoring can be done later on.
Good, then I think we can all agree the bankster controlled Blockstream is centralizing Bitcoin and the hard fork upcoming will decentralize BTC properly.

That makes no sense. I just looked into Monero's block size.

>where each node needs to know the status of each other node in the network, basically a gossip network as well

That's not true, in LN it works on a need-to-know basis. Ideally you and your transaction counterpart would be using the same node, in which case no other LN node is aware of your transaction taking place. If there is one hop, then 2 nodes are aware. Two hops, three nodes. Etc."
"You don't understand. The DAO hack drained 3.6 million ETH (now valued at almost $1 billion) into the hackers account. The Ethereum Foundation put out an open poll, and the vast majority of token holders voted to fork the network and rollback the hack.

This wasn't ""one person"" controlling the network, it was the entire network coming to consensus to undo a terrible thing. 

Note: Vitalik Buterin doesn't even have control to just fork the network. The overwhelming vote to fork was followed by all the Ethereum client teams (not all of which are run by the Ethereum Foundation) updating their clients to include the fork, and then miners switched to the new version to mine on the pre-hacked chain. E.g. it wasn't Vitalik that undid the hack, it was the vast majority of miners that did it on their own."
Must be subliminal
I am a hodler but I don't intend to ever sell. I see the scalability problems as something that puts lower cap on the price compared to what big blocks would provide. I still think that cap is extremely high but as I said I'm in for the long run. I imagine Bitcoin at $30 000 in 5 years and staying there if it is digital gold and 50K in 10 years if it is digital cash (still staying at $30K if it is digital gold).
It takes 2 to fight
Ethereum should have died along with the hack. Now there's two shitcoins: one that doesn't understand immutability and the other with a large amount of hacked funds. Investors beware.
BTC and BCH are doing just fine after their HF as well.

I am not an expert in the field but in order to find the best path in a de-centralized network, you need to know the status of each node. [This thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/71i6y3/a_brief_teardown_of_some_of_the_flaws_in_the/) has information about that and other issues about LN."

Consensus doesn't mean what you seem to think it means here.
Let us see what happens when Bitcoin Cash attempts to hardfork themselves. I'm guessing a coin for the people who want to keep EDA and a coin for the people who don't.
There will be hardforks down the road, but it will be the last resort when it comes to scaling. I dont think you will find any dev who wont say the same.
">Contentious hard forks are different than hard forks with mass agreement. BTC, a long while back, successfully hard forked without fighting and with major consensus.

See here's the thing. A handful of developers, and 20 to 30 Reddit fanboys is what you're referring to when you say ""mass agreement"". 

You probably don't realize that. So before you disagree, hear me out:

That particular subgroup was okay with the fork you're referring to.  And it went well because that particular subgroup has control over the repository. 

They decide what gets approved and what doesn't. So if they don't agree, they can create the perception that there's mass disagreement.  And maliciousness. 

What you're seeing ***now*** is actually mass agreement. Major companies with millions of users, large mining groups, and tens of thousands of individual users expressing an opinion. 

Development is centralized in bitcoin.  And it's really unfortunate that the only way to get things done is to create an entirely new development team and an entirely new implementation of the software. 

But that's what happens when somebody holds the repository hostage."
"> No proposal has ever gotten consensus.

No, it should be: ""no proposal has ever been approved by the Blockstream Politburo."""
"> Contentious hard forks are different than hard forks with mass agreement.

I think the BTC has been taken over by coin holders. They are less interested in progress. Ethereum, on the other hand, has a high focus on improved functionality and scalability. It is not targeted to holders, but to users. Because of that, it is easy to get consensus for protocol upgrades.

And then, if a protocol upgrade turns out to be contentious, what is the problem? Let the market decide!

"Haha - sometimes I think that. Then I look at events like the DAO and remind myself ""never stick your investments in a crazy""."
"People that have been using it as a lifeboat in countries with failing currencies is not interesting? People have a choice for a form of money that can't be controlled or manpiluted by their government is a minor use? The creation of a money that is truly borderless and allowing frictionless global commerce isn't significant? Of course it's still relatively small, but it's growing rapidly... How else would you expect something as massive as this to play out? We'd all just wake up one day and be using it for everything?

This kind of use has begun skyrocketing in countries that need it, those lbc show a beautiful story. The majority of people buying on lbc are not just doing for speculative purposes, they are buying it because they need it, because it provides another option to do things that were otherwise impossible. If you can't see that then you haven't been paying attention. "
Yes, like what the bitcoin community experienced in terms of blocksize debate for 2+ years.

"> Contentious hard forks are different than hard forks with mass agreement. 

Yes.  There's zero reasons why a simple 2mb upgrade to the network should be contentious in the first place.  Not even Core can make any technical arguments against it, all of their arguments come back to political FUD, most of which originated from them in the first place.

> The market will decide on the better currency.

Yep, and so far this year, the market [has severely punished BTC](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DALFglbUMAAEre6.jpg:large) for the unbelievable incompetence.

> Isn't ETH essentially controlled by one person? 

No, ETH is free open source software.  Anyone can run any client they choose.  They even have multiple clients to choose from, unlike Core's insistence that there be no other clients.

> Also, ETC and ECH had a VERY contentious HF a few years back.

Not that contentious, 10% of the network stayed behind, and now no one pays attention to ETC.  It has a tiny tiny amount of transaction volume."
"Where have you been? Sleeping?

Blockstream's ENTIRE modus operandi is the mantra ""hard forks are dangerous""."
If centralization is progress, I don’t want it.
And we keep trying to explain to extremists like yourself that community concensus before any changes are made is nearly impossible to achieve given that everyone has different agendas. At this stage of the debate, all scaling options should be pursued with the market choosing which is the better way. 
"> your bet is fucking retarded. Either bitcoin becomes a reserve currency and I win 100k satoshi or bitcoin is destabilized and you win something about as useful as Zimbabwe dollars


By that logic, [so are you](https://xkcd.com/670/)"
"> govt will now be pissed off with BTC and might try controlling it niw


now*, and hyuk, like they care. They're making decent headway killing the internet in its current form. Once that's done nothing else will matter."
"They're called intelligence agencies[.](#this ""comment is on your logic, not your spelling"") "
If you think the crowd is going to agree with 1 MB blocks, you're the one who is sadly mistaken.
If you think Satoshi would rather his paper dictate the future rather than the crowd, you probably don’t understand Bitcoin. 
Maybe wikileaks has other fish to fry, like hillary clinton, and doesn't keep up with crypto news.  They may have no knowledge of the blockstream takeover.

"The real contradiction is it's usually the same idiots posting ""why all these different opinions"" as who complain ""wow ur all a hivemind"" when there's general agreement.


Usually it's just noise/trolling, but occasionally it's someone legitimately too stupid to graduate from diapers. In either case it's best to just RES mute them."
If you're going to alter the whitepaper by doing layer two then the ethical path is to create an altcoin
"> Crypto is a serious threat to fiat, we all agree on that.


I don't agree on that. 


The wealthy are the same no matter what medium you're in, and there are plenty of rich people trying to control Bitcoin. Rich people tend to end up coming to an understanding with statists, and statists won't let crypto undercut fiat. The closest it'd ever get is getting subsumed into fiat.


The population at large doesn't care and won't blink when crypto is regulated - hell, there's proof of that already. Try operating an exchange without a license, see how much outrage gets generated when you get locked up.

No eth?
No shit. 😮

But only if you're not a german user, right? Why are Kraken/Payward the counterparty for German users? 🤔
