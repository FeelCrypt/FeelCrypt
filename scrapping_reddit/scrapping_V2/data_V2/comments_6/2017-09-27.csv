Thanks! I'm already in the process of setting up a full node locally. I think more information needs to be put out on nodes, as it's often a overlooked aspect of crypto currencies.
"Quality shitpost.

You forgot about the requirement to open a side channel, which will then allow you to attach the picture of the 140 extra characters. Oh, and one thing I forgot to mention, there are file hosting fees for the picture, but they are very low, and the image is sent on the web at Lightning™ speed."

Haha
So THAT'S why my Core i7 on gigabit LAN has been having so much trouble loading my Twitter feed lately!  
Made me smile /u/tippr $.1
[removed]
if you'll force this and it gets accepted the door developers and tweety will abandon twitter!
What's next? FULL NOVELS ONLINE?
"Hahaha TweetStream ! Did you TM this shit already and go for AXA support?

I 'm sure if you put down a shitty blockchain 2 pager business plan and a ICO coin you get 200 Mio VC!"

"you are forgetting that every new twitter user needs to run a full-twit node. 
they need to download the entire twatchain. so we need to cap its growth."
You'll need a perpetual generator for that.

"Is this how bad bitcoin cash is doing?  Nevermind, I know the answer.  

It's a pretty sad state of affairs.  "

Image Markets™ will solve this. Stop spamming Twitter.

"This is absolutely the way forward. It prevents excess data usage on the twitter server by simply requiring that an image hosting server stores the photo.

The fact that a jpg of text requires more data than the plaintext is okay if done this way"
Well if they can't afford it, then tweets are just not meant for them.
"What matters more than anything else is that users in the third world can use TweetReader™ full versions; It doesn't matter if they can't actually tweet themselves.  They can use the Electrolyte™ Network to tweet to other Electrolyte™ network users for the same fees they paid before!

:-) You are not far off with the Segwit part, remember that they excluded any link from the word count thus increasing the length available to users
Shitpost so good one would think you work at Eigen air base.
is there a satellite?
As more and more tweets are made, the pages will start taking too long to load! To protect against this, I propose we reduce the character limit to 30 characters. Why 30?  By assuming a 17.7% rate of technological improvement, adding tweets of 30 characters will not increase page load time.
"Experts Conclude TweetStream's SegTxt™© Technology Is Decentralized And Superior, And It's Got Electrolytes!

John Smith and Bob Jones, both total experts in the field, have completed their highly technical research into Twitter's current character limits.  They discovered that you won't like the very bad people who want to increase the character limit.  

""They're clearly trying to take over decentralized Twitter,"" says John Smith, the new CTO of Brickdream, Inc, the open source decentralized team of developers that invented Bitfoil, the future successor to Bitcoin.  ""These people who want to raise the character limit are racists,"" he continues.  ""As a developer I read code all day.  Also, as stated above, I am a total expert - put your camera on these papers that prove it.  Bob and I have evaluated the proposal to increase character limit veryh carefully.  We discovered the racists' code to be homophobic as well, and also anti-semitic, and, well, that's where we draw the line.  We cannot allow such an increased character limit in our society and have decided to get on our knees in protest of the Twitter dictatorship.""

TweetStream's SegTxt™© Technology on the other hand, is designed for the Electrolyte Network.  Electrolytes cannot possibly be racist or homophobic.  Most importantly, they can't be anti-semitic either.  Bob Jones has published a great deal of research pertaining to Electrolytes.  ""Only the Electrolyte Network will allow Twitter to scale in a decentralized fashion.  And only we've got it,"" Jones concludes in his groundbreaking research report, titled It's Got Electrolytes, Brought To You By Carl's Jr.

"$.50 u/tippr

I lol'ed"
My biggest concern is how this increased character limit will affect users in the 3rd world. They deserve to have their own tweets. The 280 character limit will make it virtually impossible for them to participate due to the increased bandwidth requirements. 
it also costs a few dollars per tweet

Twitter is limited to 140 characters so that you have room to put a username in your message when you're using it via SMS. This hard fork is literally unusable!

lmao this is actually golden, go post it on yours.org dude!!
"But maybe you could reuse your RasPI to slow down legacy bitcoin a bit AND make Luke lucky? ;)"
">SegTxt© 

Not ""SegTwit""?"
We need #NO280 hats!
They cancelled my card.. :(
Shitcoin no cash
I believe this is only in Beta.   Will be in full wallet soon.  
They could add this in the future, but so far only have announced the support of Bitcoin Cash in their wallet.
Ah, lol. Man that guy is a real troll lmao 
Classic has done it, and other wallet are moving to it as well.
You forget where you are. Segwit2x IS for the good of the ecosystem. 
no thanks, not interested in that altcoin
My guess is they are waiting for the C addresses to be implemented everywhere
Just did it in version 3.8.2
"Your wallet needs to stop using the old soon to be depcrecated format.

"
"So if you've got CoPay, just go to Settings, enable Bitcoin Cash Support and click the Scan for BCH button. Your BCH balance will be reflected after a few seconds.

Thanks CoPay!"
They have not yet announced that, so I would say no.
Yes, this guarantees that BitPay is going to come to BCC
Wow 43 down votes and counting. I've never seen such huge numbers before. Congrats.
"I'm not sure you understand Bitcoin.  If they are leaving bitcoin, they're not ""being forked"", they're leaving.  What you're saying sounds more like ""You can't fire me because I quit""."
take note that to interact with many other bitcoin cash wallets, you'll need to use the address translator https://bitpay.github.io/address-translator/
Blue looks more official. Bitpays sign of approval
[deleted]
I'm mildly shocked you can't even undersatnd simple things. 
You're thinking of that other sub where anyone who doesn't agree that BCH is garbage gets banned or shadowbanned. 
Think this is only in Beta.  
"Bitpay only deals with one crypto, BTC. Adding BCH means full integration is around the corner; therefore, this is why I believe the title is not misleading. This IS a huge deal!"
"With Bitcore v5 you can attach any bitcoin implementation: https://blog.bitpay.com/bitcore-v5/

Just launch a Bitcoin ABC node and attach it to bitcore."
Is there now a bitcore for bitcoin cash?
So go back to that censored sub and quit trolling here.
