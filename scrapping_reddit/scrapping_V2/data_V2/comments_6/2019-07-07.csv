That's wrong in my opinion
Maybe Satoshi is a transgender athlete playing female sports and winning all the trophies.

Lol
At least you're smart enough to present the best piece of evidence against him, respect for that. I admit I do not know why he said what he said in that case. The amount of evidence that speak to his knowledge about bitcoin and what is possible beyond it, in addition to personally hearing him discuss such things in person have been more than overwhelming evidence for me. I urge you to read his medium posts if you have an open mind, if not no worries I'm not here to convince you. I wish you all the best
You nitwits always jump to conclusions and never let the man explain himself. You linked to some shit where I can’t even view his original comment. You realize he stated he’s satoshi in the Kleiman case and there was NO OBJECTIONS? You’re in for a rude awakening..
That makes sense.
Thanks to everyone who reported the scam post.
"I think your comment is either too clever for me of we have failed to communicate effectively.

&#x200B;

I wasn't suggesting you hide your identity (or not).  I was suggesting that Satoshi clearly took some effort to do so, so pretending to be a different gender isn't very far fetched."
Nice bot.
"That kind of knowledge is meaningless for determining who wrote the original code. In fact, I suspect that the original author had no clue what some of the implications of what he or she wrote would be.

That's true for almost everything any programmer has ever written, most especially if it becomes widely used."
"I have skimmed some of his medium posts, but they may not be a representative sample.

In the past I have used ""[Why I troll](https://medium.com/@craig_10243/why-i-troll-5304f2cbbfc3)"" as further evidence that he is not Satoshi.

In that piece, he doubles down on the false notion that Bitcoin mining makes progress. That is the only way the finding of blocks would not be independent events. Bitcoin mining is progress free *by design*. Otherwise, the miner with the fastest CPU would win every time."
"The archive links are here:

As for the the ""NO OBJECTIONS"": ""pick your battles"" or ""give the man enough rope to hang himself"" may apply."
Wikipedia article standards for who gets a page must be all out of whack.
Yep
That’s awesome LOL
It all started with Mr.Satoshi.
Someone should wear this jersey in the courtroom for the Kleiman/Wright case. lol
stop giving him attention
CSW even wore this t shirt on Christmas day and posted it on his Twitter . B4 he nuked it.
lmao. perfect.
"hahah, oh I like this man and t-short :D

we all are Satoshi :DDD"
so, accurate lol
The vast majority on this sub has never endorsed and backed Craig as Satoshi. And not a single person, except the usual four or five BSV trolls, does anymore.
Craig Wright is Satoshi Nakamoto.
Maybe he's not trans. Maybe he's some dude with a goatee that likes to wear lipstick. Like on Billy Madison.

Funny, coming from the sub that literally endorsed and backed this guy as Satoshi.
"If the are on androgen blockers. they will lose much of the 'male' edge.

In any case, that is a little off-topic.

You can use a trans pseudonym without being trans-gendered."
"Do you have evidence of that? Because we have evidence that he is not.
