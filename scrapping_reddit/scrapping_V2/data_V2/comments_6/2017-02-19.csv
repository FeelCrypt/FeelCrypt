"What people fail to realize is that /r/bitcoin isn't Bitcoin Core. /r/bitcoin is a privately moderated subreddit and isn't a democracy. You're at the mercy of the mods. They just registered the subreddit first. 

But in /r/btc its just Bitcoin Unlimited shilling, and fudding of Core.

Wish we can have an uncensored subreddit where we can just be excited about Bitcoin without trying to divide the community or silence it."
