I have resigned from Bitfinex. I wrote [this medium post](https://decentralize.today/i-have-resigned-from-bitfinex-4d7f1c6e48de#.tah3mg1c2) about my feelings towards bitfinex and my reasons for leaving 
I'm sure they'll pick up on the communication front, I only resigned a week ago so it can be tough to get someone up to speed and out there in that time. Give them some time, i'm sure they'll be around. 
Well, good luck on your future career, you were a real asset during the Bitfinex hack. Can you point to any new communication path for Bitfinex? They've been a bit quiet.
"Hey /u/zanetackett,

I see you are plenty active regarding segwit. Why is nobody from BFX staff answering on the bnk fundraiser forum for almost a month? I hope you are reallly active behind the scenes because there hasn't been any communication or report from BFX for some time."
I've read your posting now and it seems reasonable to quit if you don't enjoy interacting with a toxic community anymore. I'm just a bit worried. Can you 100% confirm that you have resigned out of free will because you didn't enjoy this kind of job anymore and have not been let go because of Bitfinex' financial difficulties or an upcoming liquidiation of the company? Was everything regarding the BNK investment process going  according to plan when you resigned? 
What does that mean? Zane, do you have resigned from BFX? Why? Any not regarding this?
"False. Did you not read the comments *you* replied to - I already provided an example of r\/bitcoin removing comments such that they are not noted as ""[removed]"". One example of many: [Here you go again](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3i2hke/august_23_2015_block_size_and_hard_fork_dialog/cudfcaz/) (I see [this](https://i.imgur.com/F87fkYK.png)) - you'll note that comment is both on topic and *not spam*.

We know r\/bitcoin mods programmed a bot to hide opinions they didn't want people to hear about, so don't be pretending censored posts got caught by a ""rogue"" spambot unless you're willing to open the sourcecode history of the r\/bitcoin bots.

And don't pretend r\/bitcoin was hiding posts for any nobler reason than to manipulate opinion. The head-mod of r\/Bitcoin - the guy you're kowtowing to - was quite clear: [""I know how moderation affects people. Long-term, banning *<non-Blockstream Bitcoin client>* from /r/Bitcoin will hurt *<non-Blockstream Bitcoin client>*'s chances""](https://archive.fo/9FxSJ)"
"> /BitcoinXio mind helping me out?

Sorry for the delay, this is done! :) "
"I 100% resigned out of free will because the nature of the work was just too draining. 

>and have not been let go because of Bitfinex' financial difficulties or an upcoming liquidiation of the company? Was everything regarding the BNK investment process going according to plan when you resigned?

I don't think I would have left if there were still worries in my mind about Bitfinex, the timing of me leaving coincided with Bitfinex routinely trading >30% of the market and as such I felt comfortable leaving a company that clearly wasn't/isn't a ""sinking ship"". I would say things at Bitfinex were going far better than anyone at the company thought they would have been on Aug. 2nd. They've had multiple days with over 40% of the BTCUSD market share; the features that they have in the pipeline (will be released soon) are nothing short of amazing; some of the other ""big"" projects that had long-been on the back burner are coming back with force; instead of a torrent of lawsuits, to my knowledge there is yet to be a single lawsuit brought against them. 

Really, my only gripe with bitfinex as of late was adding zcash... 

As I said in my medium post, i foresee bitfinex continuing to dominate the bitcoin space as the leading BTCUSD trading platform. "
