"""Yeah guys. Just believe me. I have facts..."" NOT a single fact given. Go back to your Den troll"
"It's also well known that it's unfair for you to make a claim hurting someone's reputation without some evidence. That kind of behaviour is looked down upon in any civilized place universally. Just because you're hiding behind a keyboard/pseudonymous username doesn't mean the rules of society stop applying to you. 

If you were attacking another pseudonymous username, maybe, but we're talking about a real person, with feelings and everything. "
"> I also once tried to report someone making death threats, and got a 72hr mute by the mods in response

I find this hard to believe, but I'm sorry to hear it.  Death threats are one of my biggest problems, being a big blocker.  I can take the DDoS attacks on my hardware, but I have a family, and guys in our field can easily-enough dox each other.  be safe.  you annoy the shit out of me, but I wish you no harm :)"
A lot of us, myself included, haven't seen it. Please share a link, I want to take a look. Since such evidence must have made the news, but I haven't noticed? I guess I'm sleepy.
"Do you have reading comprehension issues? My claims about the mods involvement with Roger & Bitcoin.com are backed by facts. 

Hell, Magma & BitcoinXio literally advertise their roles in their Reddit moderator flair! "
"Thanks for sharing your viewpoint on the financial ties. 

Honestly, in isolation I would be okay with *some* overlap between his employees and his mods. (assuming the Reddit rules permit this) These are likely individuals he's known for years, whom he trusts, who have Bitcoin-related experience, etc... so it is understandable from his perspective. 

However, it becomes concerning when the typical narrative in /r/btc is very critical of imagined/assumed financial ties between Core/Blockstream and Theymos and other r/bitcoin mods, and any attempt to claim otherwise gets buried. 

>I'm quite likely to get a different side of your story from bitcoinxio, but I am sorry to hear your experience here.

thanks, I appreciate that.

creationlayer denied being responsible for the 72hr mute and I believe them, although I did not receive a reply when asked to check modlog for who did. Oh well, no real harm... just surprised me. 

>The people you mention, by the way, were all totally non value added trolls. It does not advance your cause with me to hold them up as examples of heavy handed moderation.

To be clear, my examples were to showcase the *inconsistent* application of moderation here, with trolls from the pro-core camp seemingly held to a far higher standard than trolls who were attacking core. 

The three banned people I mentioned likely qualify as trolls, but their conduct appeared within the rules and was infinitely more civil than the people mentioned in my screenshots.

I mean... here's the thread which resulted in tropser & demotruk's bans: https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4tzax1/soupernerd_mod_of_rbtc_is_brigading_posts_with_a/d5lih0t/

"Honestly I don't remember. This is a year ago or so when creationlayer was mod. Unfortunately reddit modlogs suck and only go back two months. But generally speaking we don't condone any sort of threats and do our best to keep things in line. If something is out of line/breaks the rules, please report it. I think you will see from the public mod logs we remove things that break the rules no matter what ""side"" that user is commenting on. "
He's made the evidence public 
"> For example, for some time Greg Maxwell was regularly insinuating that SouperNerd (who himself was a mod at the time) was a serial rapist - and SouperNerd neither banned Greg or even removed these libelous posts.

I agree that was in *very* poor taste.

although in case you didn't catch the reference being made, the *""xxxxx raped and murdered a girl in 1990""* joke / phrase has sort of entered American public consciousness as rhetoric to describe the near impossibility of disproving an absurd & baseless claim made without evidence. 

Here's a surprisingly detailed wikipedia article regarding the phrase, it's usage, and resulting legal challenges:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beck_v._Eiland-Hall

Ironically, it's actually lengthier than the wiki article on the original:

Great cop out, but it's a fact what I just said. 
What? Where? I don't think Im living under a rock..
"I found it super hard to believe as well!

I saw someone following devs around and making various absurd criminal allegations, complete with what appeared to be a threat.

http://imgur.com/B463NqQ (just the tip of the iceberg I'm afraid)

I reported this behavior to the mods.

A week passes and I notice sockpuppet accounts reposting many of the same same BS claims. (minus the threat)  

So... I sent a PM to the mods with further details. (I'd assumed this was ban evasion)

I then discovered that they had not banned any of the users responsible (even the threat guy, not banned) and PM'ed the mods again. Bam, 72hr mute.

I was quite frustrated at the time, as core supporters were being held to **wildly** different standards than the people attacking core.

(this was right around the time Anduckk, tropser & demotruk were banned for dubious reasons)

>you annoy the shit out of me, but I wish you no harm :)

I am sorry to hear I annoy you, and I thank you :)

What do you think of the various claims I've made in this thread? 

It's quite annoying when anything critical of /r/btc gets buried with a flood of downvotes, despite being factually accurate. Various mods do outright admit working for Roger... in fact at one point earlier this year *every single full mod* had public financial ties to Roger. 
"
"I'm glad that Roger is willing to pay to defend your freedom to post here. I wish this wasn't needed, but it is, thanks to Theymos etc.

I'm surprised you got muted, but you didn't get banned.  I guess the mods decided they had heard your case and weren't going to act on it.  The mods here don't act on a lot of this sort of stuff.  For example, for some time Greg Maxwell was regularly insinuating that SouperNerd (who himself was a mod at the time) was a serial rapist - and SouperNerd neither banned Greg or even removed these libelous posts.

I'm quite likely to get a different side of your story from /u/bitcoinxio, but I am sorry to hear your experience here. The people you mention, by the way, were all totally non value added trolls. It does not advance your cause with me to hold them up as examples of heavy handed moderation."
He probably took a bunch of money from the banks to tank BTC and invested it in ETH. Or he was given a shit load of it during the ETH pre-mine.
"ETH ICO was fair.

If you don't approve of ICO's, then yeah, BTC LTC DOGE XMR best coins with fair distribution."
wow - that is some heavy abuse.  makes r/btc seems very polite (and yet we are accused of being the haters). This might just the start of the what is in store for Greg, Adam, Luke and Theymos when all the people on that other forum realize how much they have been duped by these arrogant or deceitful fools. Time for a revolt!
Can someone please explain to me why he thinks Bitcoin in it's current state is acceptable?
I have been using dash and ethereum lately and it makes btc seen like a joke. I am considering selling 80% of my BTC for either. I couldn't believe it transferred so fast. Faster than Bitcoin EVER was?!
"His reply is even stupider.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6ereib/these_fees_are_unacceptable/die8jvu/"
Received a PM threatening to dox me from /u/Behind_you_ , presumably in response to this.  Lovely.
Hey don't insult inbreds like that!
Out of the loop here, but who is that guy and why should I care what he says? 
Because they've been bought/paid with a lot of FIAT. Honestly with 75mil$ Blockstream/Core can all retire. Screw the Bitcoin community. Bunch of weirdos with a dream for a better society...
"hardfork bitcoin and continue satosh's vision. Bitcoin still has a huge network merchants, payment providers that will support us.

I would rather hard fork bitcoin then sell my bitcoin for alt coins. 

The UASF folks will split the chain for us anyway. Its called a fork for a reason. "
I'd say LTC over DOGE any day of the week. And the premine/gift element of ETH is a little bit concerning...
dude, don't get roped into flat earth debates.  90% chance its just someone trolling you.   its mostly just noise makers, intentional cognitivive dissonance or genuine morons.
Yeah, but the difference is in population and connectivity. Get used to real life looking, sounding, feeling, tasting, and smelling like the internet or gtfo.
Especially people in Developing countries who can feed their starving families for a month with 80$ (fee for a Bitcoin TX in 2017)... But they'll sure run a server in their hut.
"If they have $50 dollars, it's not worth paying $85 to use it.  So they shouldn't use it or pay the fee.
"
"""I hodl, but not by choice."""
I can't agree honestly. Ethereum is next to nothing without bitcoin, so those two might as well be considered paired coins. Ripple is unlikely to have low level consumer use so why should I be worried about that taking over btc? I don't even need to mention the rest, they're all too small right now to be seriously considered as a replacement. 
Also Dash and Golem are interesting
Because tired meme... 
148Coin... Because it has 148 paid amazon servers running the code :P
Why do people not seem to care that eth was heavily premined. I see litecoin a nearly identical btc clone but with the fairest launch ever.
"*enh*. Times and styles change.

500 years ago, Middle English parents were horrified at that Shakespearean Modern English trash culture that their kids found so compelling.

1,000 years ago, Old English parents were horrified at that Frenchified Middle English patois that their kids gibbered in.

1,500 years ago, Celtic parents were horrified at that Anglo Saxon goat-noise that their kids bleeted in.

Today, it's all texting, trolling, and Blockstream sockpuppets.

Now, *stay off my lawn*!!!"
Wtf does Roger have to do with Luke being an asshole. Go back to your Den troll
"I've never been banned, although I have had posts removed / censored in the past.

Well this must be the other 10% then. Not trolling.
