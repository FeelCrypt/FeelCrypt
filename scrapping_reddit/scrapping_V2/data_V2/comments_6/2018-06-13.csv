 I have found a trustworthy project for investment. It is called Hello Gold Foundation. They are heavily vested in blockchain technology and focused on expanding the availability of products that are targeted at helping the underserved and unbanked. By supporting in this project it is possible to support much more startups that will reside grants from HelloGold foundation for their development. 
Credits is a unique platform which provides a fundamentally different approach to tackling any information security problems facing the blockchain system. You can know more here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YM-BgEuEAs
I like that their nefarious behavior is recorded for all to see in [their own public moderator logs](https://snew.github.io/r/cryptocurrency/about/log).
Can you expand on that. How/why were you kicked out? Were reasons given? 
I'm not sure what you mean. I guess you might mean when people use strong language and stuff without clear reason, behavior that kind of alienates newcomers?
"Anyone who thinks we need to be diplomatic with Blockstream/Core doesn't understand the ""intransigent minority"", read Nassim Taleb: [https://medium.com/incerto/the\-most\-intolerant\-wins\-the\-dictatorship\-of\-the\-small\-minority\-3f1f83ce4e15#.sxt5mlel4](https://medium.com/incerto/the-most-intolerant-wins-the-dictatorship-of-the-small-minority-3f1f83ce4e15#.sxt5mlel4)

The vast majority of people will continue using BTC even though its capacity is deliberately crippled by Blockstream, and they will not know the reason why this was done. The Core intransigent minority will maintain this ridiculous limit. Only when BCH gains more adoption, value, and confidence will it usurp this order. 

Luckily, Lightning is and always has been completely doomed to fail. The markets already invented, tested, and implemented sidechains 4 years ago \- they're called ALTCOINS, and they're being used to transmit $100\+ billion every day. "
Hello, I'm a mod at r/CC although I'm fairly new, I'm afraid I haven't heard of you until now. When were you a mod?
">I'm sorry, but /r/monero has nothing to do with /r/bitcoin.

Never said they did. I said the same mods i.e. people **in control** of those subs also control r/cryptocurrency behind the scenes, not that they literally are the same people. However, a member of r/cryptocurrency is indeed a prominent member of the xmr community. 

>Stop making shit up just to shill your shitty coin. Dash is a premine scam.

My, my aren't you testy?"
"I meant that one of the mods of r/cryptocurrency is a prominent member of the xmr community u/samsunggalaxyplayer, and that the same people who control r/bitcoin, control r/monero and r/cryptocurrency. I.e. there is a large group that has been quietly buying/wresting control of main crypto communication channels in order to control the narrative. The monero community uses the same tactics that r/bitcoin shills used during the whole 4 years of the scaling debate. 

I'm not shilling for Dash here, Dash was the target of these attacks also for the last 4 years. Its hard to believe that's a coincidence, especially since they use the same tactics (repeating the lie, 'yelling' in posts, insults, namecalling, using shame/peer-pressure to shut opposition up etc.). "

"Not just the censorships. Let me share with you what I had to deal with...

1) Bitcoin Core trolls harassments online.

2) DDOS on my pro Bitcoin Cash website.

3) Some other hack attempts on my pro Bitcoin Cash website which I won't go into details about but I check my logs so I saw what's going on.

4) Plus I really dislike the propaganda/deceptive practices from rbitcoin.

5) Being shadowbanned because of mass reports on my social media account likely by Bitcoin Core trolls.

And maybe some other stuff I can't remember. But I do remember this saying...

First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out—
Because I was not a Socialist.

Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out—

"That's why our voice is important. Only other voices I can prove in my post I am a real human being with a history. I am a lover and fan of Bitcoin. I was part of the group of people that made it a success. That talked about it with everybody. That told everybody in 2011 to buy it because it was going to go BIG. Those that listened profitten hugely. 

Nothing has changed. We forked to save Bitcoin, not to destroy or attack it. Our enemies are hypocrites and cowards, they gave Bitcoin a bad rap and made it look like Bitcoin can't work because of one stupid line of code that says: maximum 400 000 tx a day.

Then they use that line as an excuse to say: look bitcoin can only do 400 000 tx  a day, we need an off chain scaling solution because bitcoin has reached the maximum it can do! 

LIARS!!!! "
"Don't you think that language like ""BTC was hacked by blockstream"" is overly polarizing? I've been in Bitcoin forever, and I really think that there's far too much vitriol \- from both sides. For example, the position that Bitcoin should have larger blocks and keep transaction on\-chain is reasonable, even if you don't agree. Likewise, the position that a hard fork to achieve that is too risky for such a large, distributed system is also reasonable, and the opposing opinions as to what extent being able to run a full, non\-mining node is important are also both defensible. 

What I'm getting at is that you don't need to tie in a blockstream conspiracy to explain Core's position, and, in my opinion, to do so makes you seem a bit crazy to your target audience (crypto noobs with limited exposure). Likewise, the constant ""bcash"" bashing by BTC maximalists isn't a good look, either."
The core troll narrative completely crumbles when facts are presented! We shouldn’t bash Bitcoin Core, but instead be civil and DESTROY their arguments with facts!

Yeah I didn't mean to imply its weird, what I meant is weird is that multiple mods were posting in the same rather obscure sub, and it seems a little too coincidental.

I do this as well but I do wish there were a place for civil conversation between both communities without the cries of censorship, sock puppet, shill etc.

see my edited reponse
I do see your point and don't think it's true to original Bitcoin, whereas Bitcoin cash is, but I don't get this argument. It's still bitcoin whether you agree with it's code direction. If it sucks, just let it die.

We contacted the reddit admins who tried to get into contact with wtf\_yoda. He didn't respond, so the admins put us all back in (which is why it looks like we've all been around for two months, rather than 5\+ years for some of us) and silenced him as a mod, but left him there at the top in case he ever did get back into contact. At this point we have to assume that his account was breached, but we just don't know. He never responded to any of us, and none of us have other methods of contacting him.

I have to agree. We all would love to be doing something more productive but if someone or some group is attempting to rewrite history, you have to challenge it and be vocal or newer folks will have no idea. Be vocal, and site sources is the best thing we can do.
"Don't really think it's fair or really accurate to judge a group by it's worst actors.

The majority here were or are original Bitcoin supporters. I think you have to understand the full history of what happened to Bitcoin and its main sub rbitcoin to fully be able to appreciate what is truly going on.

Do your own research and its crystal clear Bitcoin and its main forums, not just rbitcoin were high jacked. There is serious money and effort behind these people to rewrite history and cripple not just Bitcoin but many if not all crypto."
Fake news. 
See my edited response
About the same time that they kicked all of the other mods out and replaced them with new ones. (All the mods there are on accounts less than 7 months!)
Yeah. Me too. You can get surprisingly good information on r/buttcoin I would say that the level of trolling is pretty similar to most crypto subs.

I disagree.  As I've stated before, you can't win by always backpedaling, and only playing defense. You can only win by playing offense.  Bullies prey on those who don't fight back.  I play offense.  Go for the jugular, go for the killshot, punch the bully in the face.  Play to win.

While the public leaders of the BCH community might want to be civil politicians, the rest of us need to be the SuperPAC attack ads, and win the fight in the trenches.

- When I post about Blockstream & Bitcoin BTC, I [document & source all my claims](https://www.yours.org/content/how-bitcoin-btc-was-hijacked--and-why-bitcoin-cash-was-created-24c7314b8b8f).

- When the Core trolls rant & drool ""[Bcash / Btrash](https://i.redd.it/ysx8w88gowe01.jpg)"", they're just posting gibberish.

As a result, I am basically planting flags.  Every exchange - like the above - means that I own that piece of internet real estate forever.  

Whether it's next week or 5 years from now, any neutral visitor will see one side ranting gibberish, and the other side documenting & sourcing all their claims.  I view every exchange like that as a piece of artwork that I leave behind.

We forked Bitcoin-BTC to save Bitcoin, not to destroy it.

Did they write you guys any excuse to why they did it? Or did they just do it in silence?
"Thanks, yeah I guess that's a lot of it. It's also frustrating when people get so offended when someone goes after ""their"" coin, but have no problem doing the same thing to other coins. The constant insults and infighting are not good for crypto as a whole. I don't know why people get so attached to it unless they are coders or dedicating their time to promoting it. Why are people so invested in a particular coin unless it comes down to greed? We should all win if crypto does well but people cheer the price falling of their ""rival"" coins. Sorry that got off topic a bit."
I mean, it's quite possible we were brigading. Let's not do that, yeah?

/r/cryptocurrencies (you know the ones who can use correct English in their subreddit title). is far better anyway. Although they have now an ugly subreddit css.

Underrated comment. 
"yeah, unfortunately you can't really have any pro-BTC or anti BCH talk here without being attacked and down-voted though. So while this sub is less censored it still ends up being just as polarized as r/bitcoin. You can criticize BCH here and your posts wont get deleted but you end up getting down-voted to hell and fighting off the hoards of big blockers so what's the point? There really isn't a good place to get a balanced opinion anymore. BCH supporters think BTC supporters are out to ruin Bitcoin and vice versa. There doesn't seem to be anywhere that a balanced conversation is happening... Now cue the ""it doesn't matter because we're right and they're wrong"" comments and the downvotes."
"That's exactly what r/BTC is for, so why does everyone else need to put up with the trolls?  If they want to argue with trolls or BCH fans they know exactly where to do it and they'll come to r/BTC

Now that everyone at r/BTC is in a bash bitcoin circle jerk they all fuel each other with Roger Ver at the helm, it's gotten out of control. The only saving grace is that the collection of trolls is concentrated in one place, so you goto r/BTC and you know exactly what to expect, makes it easier to deal with.

I sent him a private message, saying that r/BTC is probably one of the few places where he can freely criticize Bitcoin BTC & rBitcoin, without getting censored.
"This is unsurprising considering they also banned tipprbot under the guise of ""well then we would have to allow every other tipping bot"" as if that is an excuse. Apparently they even allow dogecoin tips still. Pathetic. Weak."
"I left that sub. Nowadays, I focus all my time and energy on Bitcoin Cash only. Before all these censorships, I was pretty neutral. The more they censor, the more vocal we have to be, not on their censored places but everywhere else.

With all the shilling going on on that sub, I find /r/buttcoin has better quality content anyway.
The mods there have been recently bought off, several of the mods seem like the same people and post in the same weird subs like /r/succulents.
I don't see any censoring, posts and comments are up
"It's still up

By bitcoin core logic, handing someone a USB stick with a private key counts as a zero-fee transaction, because just like lightning network, no coins were actually transacted on-chain. 
The same mods in control of r/bitcoin are in control of r/xmrtrader and r/monero and r/cryptocurrency. BTC, XMR, and LTC are all attack-coins. r/cryptocurrency censors BCH and they HEAVILY CENSOR DASH, basically any coin that attempts to fulfill the original P2P digital cash that was Satoshi's original dream. This is what is hated and attacked. They've allowed FUD to reign about Dash for years, oh and guess what? One of the 3 main mods before the biggest addition of mods is a prominent member of the xmr community.

Buying off the mods is the  most logical thing a corporate would do, they  can get a huge amount of free ads and control the narrative with only a few thousands bucks which is peanuts for them.
You can just tell they all sleep in the same bed with r/bitcoin. It's just mad.
"I used to be a mod of r/cryptocurrency until they kicked me out. Now, that sub, is controlled all by mods with accounts less than 7 months old!

EDIT: [Here](https://imgur.com/vE1nfkB) is the reason I was kicked out. Names have been censored out of respect for these users. Ironically, the two mods mentioned here have also been removed from r/cc. Now, it doesn't really bother me that they kicked me out. But I didn't start caring about this issue until a month ago, when I started investigating the Bitcoin Cash and other censorship going on in the sub. That's also when I found out that those other two mods were also gone, and that around the same time, the entire modbase seemed to be replaced. It seems like blatant whitewashing."
"> You may not be bashing Bitcoin's original vision, but like it or not that's what Bitcoin's become and thus you're bashing it.

Nothing weird about /r/succulents
Can you go into more detail about this post? I compared the mods of /r/bitcoin and /r/monero and there is no cross over. There certainly could be alt-accounts though.
"> The same mods in control of r/btc

What?"
A technology cannot be insulted, but it can be called out and critisized for being shitty. THAT happens a lot. Deal with it.

Incorrect, I would have an issue with that. r/btc is for uncensored Bitcoin discussions where anyone can talk or troll people who like talking about coins that share the same genesis block as Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin (BCH) being the main alternative. 
Your [whataboutism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whataboutism) is weak.
"So will RV still donate if nothing happens ? No ? *Doesn’t sound like such an altruistic charitable donation to me*. 

If that is what you understand from this I think you’ve effectively misunderstood what RV was what was being implied.

Whether you prefer BCH or BTC, the tweet is unethical (both times) and would get me a big fail on my workplace ethics and bribery training. If someone at my work place did this (even verbal) and were caught they would be fired for trying to bribe. It’s just a fact. 

Agreeing that the tweet is not appropriate and touches on bribery does not mean you’ve crossed the ‘void’ and now support core. "
Yeah r/bitcoin is an awful sub, but they aren’t breaking any rules. We had the freedom to come over here instead and now we don’t have to deal with the censorship
"Not true.

You can get ban on r/bitcoin for who you are even when you are not subscribed to r/bitcoin.

You don't have to go against that sub rules to be ban there."
"/r/bitcoin has banned people for things they have posted on other subreddits.  That's kind of above and beyond if you ask me.

That place is very well groomed.  Yes, they have rules in place.  But all those Litecoin posts clearly violated the rules, yet were allowed because they were pro-segwit and pro-lightning. despite the rules being quite clear that no altcoin discussions of any kind are allowed."
That's comparing apples and oranges. Removing the censorship of a subreddit is completely different from changing the name.
"Pft, don't bother with those useless ""facts""!"
That has nothing to do with the point I’m making 
TIL having a censorship free forum for a censorship resistant currency is 'nonsense bullshit' 
Its a quid pro quo scenario. Roger offers $250k to a charity of Reddit's choosing, and Reddit, in return, enforces alternative moderation policies on r/Bitcoin to combat censorship
Very funny.
"Those are “guidelines for a healthy community” it’s not a policy about if the community is allowed to do that or not. It’s a suggestion how to make a good community.

I don’t see that community breaking any terms of use or their content policy"
Better lightning all day than anti BTC everyday
Roger Ver says he knows who owns the account.
All the political are starting to get worse again now that midterms are coming up
Good point. I think better would be to make the mod logs public.
What he means is that this community is getting toxic
"I will donate a quarter of a million to charity *if* 'nonsense bullshit that will not happen'.

If you can afford it, donate it you fucking cretin. "
[removed]
your right this sub is more bottom up censorship. Which was so bad that they had to launch an antiechochamber bot to counter the trolldectectr bot. The only things that get to the top here are circle jerking roger ver, attacking LN and bitcoin 
Pro Bitcoin so anti BTC.
">  you wont find any news here

You will find all Bitcoin Cash related news here. "
"If you want to do charity then you should just do it. 
This is absolute bribing. "
Redditor /u/aga080 has low karma in this subreddit.
"How is that not bribery? What happens when they appoint a diff mod that he or anyone else disagrees with? Would they offer another 1/4 mil to change the mods? 

It sets a precedent that Reddit can be controlled by outside influences. Also, if he were really looking to donate he could simply do it without asking for something in return. Let’s not deny he has an agenda and is simply looking to spread his reach beyond his current “sudo ownership”. Let’s not forget he was the one complaining about babies dying. That just further proves his agenda. "

"Asking to do something  inorder to "" donate "" money is not charity. Think with your brain you moron. 
No point in arguing with morons like you. "
"It doesn't count where the money will go, because the corrupter will pay the money regardless: he's interested in what the money can ""purchase"", who will get them is not relevant to him.

He did the same with the Bitcoin twitter account, and look now: it's censored, but according to the other side it's not: ""it's moderated against the trolls"", that ironically is the same argumentation of the Bitcoin sub mods.

It's all relative, depending from which side you will look at it... what's universally wrong is someone offering money to influence a decision that wouldn't been taken otherwise... that is the definition of: bribery.
"
Well we know invested in lots of crypto projects like ripple at 1cent and ETH 60cent. Perhaps now the market has fallen so much he is under a billion.
How is it fraudulent?
Or rather, RV will only make the $250k donation if they change the mods to ones he approves of. 
"Reddit shouldn't have to be bribed to do their own job and enforce their own policies that are in place.

On this we agree."
"It is not bribery and donation to charity presented in this way is also used in politics and businesses. Usually to apologise, challenge to moral action or similar.

Donations to charity can be used as hidden bribe, but I don't think it is in this case. 



"
Yes, we all should approve of mods that don't manipulate and censor.
"I think you’re purposefully missing the point. 

Offering to effectively pay $250k to have someone moderate to your liking is something different to what you are implying. 

The suggestion of a payment of this kind on a quid-pro-quo basis is unethical. It’s a bribe as clear as a bribe can be - no matter who the money goes to. Can any one afford this donation or is this just for rich people ? What could $500k afford you ? What would $50 ?

He tried this back in April when commenting on Reddit’s profitability. It was low then and it’s still low now. "
I know, I'm curious to see what he says.
Yah the rules are laid out. I mean they’re pretty heavy handed with moderation over at bitcoin sub but if u follow the rules you won’t get banned. They’re allowed to have strict rules in place. This sub already covers BCH and is already a pretty strong echo chamber do we need more of these?
Except one of those is a fan subreddit, the other is supposed to be unbiased 
"I'm on mobile so I can't check too will but censoring for monetary gain is covered in one of Reddit rules.

Side note market manipulation is also a federal crime."
">I’m actually curious, what reddit policy is r/bitcoin breaking?

Some of these: [https://www.reddit.com/help/healthycommunities/](https://www.reddit.com/help/healthycommunities/) (Linked in the sidebar under ""Mod Policy"" of every subreddit)

At least ""Consistent Guidelines"" and ""Appeals"" are not followed by that subreddit."
Then why hang the stipulation over Reddit’s proverbial head? This is the definition of a bribe. If it was altruistic then that money would be in the hands of the charity already and it wouldn’t be a Twitter post. But instead Ver wants something that *suits* him. There’s no way this ain’t self serving. If it wasn’t then why zero in on /bitcoin when there’s plenty of subs worse in way of censorship. He’s specifically targeting that sub for a reason. To me that’s pretty clear. 
There's a reason /r/politics was removed as a default subreddit.  During the election it was blatantly obvious that Correct The Record owned the mods on that subreddit.
Good bot
Wasn't me, looks like some people are a bit on the edge on that topic.
what do you mean?
There are open mod logs. I'd love to see your proof that they censorship on this sub.
Downvotes does not equal censorship. I still see your shitty reply even if it's on the bottom.
"Well we can prove Roger owned the site before the split, that's pretty easy with a simple Google search. As far as who owns the bitcoin Twitter account, you can't disprove or prove who has control of it at this time, so it's speculation at best that Roger is indeed behind the Twitter account
Edit: upon a search (do your own research) Roger has owned the bitcoin.com site since 2014"
Bad bot. 
Are they not enforcing their own policies currently? I mean it’s strict and heavy handed but the rules are laid out pretty clearly just ppl don’t agree with them doesn’t mean it goes against any policy because that *is* the policy for that sub. 
"I’m actually curious, what reddit policy is r/bitcoin breaking?

Because I know censorship or strict modding is fine or else we wouldn’t have r/politics or TD"
Oh come on, don't down vote it it's clearly humor.
Bad bot 
It would seem so, sorry to jump to conclusions!

He's a troll. Trolls like to poke at people and waste their time. He was looking for an emotional response from that statement.

"> what do you mean?

Apparently he believes in moral relativism.

For him, punishing innocent moderators of noncensored subreddit is the same as punishing guilty moderators of censored subreddit.

Or, he may be just a paid troll."
So you have an uncensored place to discuss? It shouldn't be too hard to convince people to move to it then.
Mental gymnastics imo.
">uncensored Bitcoin discussions

You're out of your mind if you think this sub is uncensored."
"That isn't ""whataboutism"", it's a hypothetical question... I swear people learn these dubious debating terms and techniques on reddit and the following week are reaching for any excuse to scream ""AD HOMINEM!"" "
That's not whataboutism. 
What I asked isn’t whataboutism tho
You can’t have it both ways, if you support what a roger wants to do here you open up a rabbit hole of bullshit
Can you provide proof of your facts? 
">I think you’re purposefully missing the point. 
>
>Offering to effectively pay $250k to have someone moderate to your liking is something different to what you are implying. 

Yes, that's because offering to ""effectively pay $250k"" to have someone ""moderate to your liking"" is something different from what we are talking about.

We're talking about offering to **donate $250K to a charity** to **stop censorship of a public community.**"
"You do know that:

1. Ver bought Bitcoin.com back when there wasn't even a scaling debate
2. The @bitcoin twitter account has nothing to do with Roger Ver.  No one knows who owns that account."
"> We don't step in unless they are breaking site wide rules or the mod guidelines.

- An admin

That means that the mod policy being broken would also be a reason for admins to interfere."
[deleted]
there is this thing with the mod rather have 90% of the community he should serve leave than do his job as told. I also find it hard to pretend that didn't happen. I know looks petty but there is a reason to it
"No one took him on this offer yet?

Maybe bankers said they will double what Roger is offering to not hire any new ones, what is $500,000 for them? Peanuts."
"This is the new concern troll tactic, guys. ""Both subs are the same""

They aren't. Don't believe it."
It's quite sad 
Can you please provide proof that this sub is getting censored? 
What *is* the problem?
Ver already bought the @bitcoin twitter handle and bitcoin.com too.  You’d think he’d focus on the branding of his own project bch but I guess it’s better to steal network effect than build it.  
Roger Fucking Ver ladies and gentlemen. I don't even think he can see the problem with this tweet. 
I don't understand what the point of this is..  I come to this sub for bch news and to the other for BTC news both have a level of censorship and that's to be expected right?
What would they do, pay 500k to a charity to accomplish absolutely nothing?
"Trying to bribe reddit. 
Roger is proving how much of a scumbag he is, again and again.  "
It's only a bribe if it's dishonest. I think fixing the mod team over at r/bitcoin is a very honest thing to do and will benefit both communities. 
Yeah exactly. That’s why I said the sub was shitty but they aren’t breaking any rules. Same way a lot of the political subs are used to push propaganda 
"First attempt of $100.000 was bribery, now you try to use ""charity""?

... very unethical"
Roger has billions, Reddit could really milk him.
So you like Nazi thought control techniques with your decentralized currency? 
"I don't go into technical questions are they breaking reddit rules, but censorship in r/bitcoin is definitely used for manipulation and preserving dominant influence over bitcoin development direction.

It is also definitely immoral."
You believe wrong
Offering to fix an injustice is not making things worse.
The mob mentality is strong on both /r/Bitcoin and /r/btc
I'm not in favour of his idea, but it's not bribing if it's a private service. Moderator positions are not an inalienable right. I just wish that Reddit had a system for a more democratic system once a subreddit reaches a certain treshold (or receives default status). I don't think r/bitcoin is large enough to qualify for such a system though.  
I mean, I'd roll with Roger over Conde Nast any day of the fucking week. So yea, fuck it. Pay them to get that shit out of here.
First proposal was to appoint a few new mods, and allow free speech.
New tweet said yesterday
Bribery comments should get down votes because it has nothing do with subject.  We all know it will never happen as he does too. This a his way of keeping the conversation going so more people study the issues at hand censorship of social media accounts .
This sub censors people?
Holy shit when will the bitching end? You guys have your own subreddit
Buying a subreddit is clearly against the rules.  Reddit should not have allowed Blockstream to buy it from Theymos, and Roger shouldn't be trying to buy it either.
Ironically that tweet sums up exactly what I don’t like about this community. Both sides are making things worse for everyone at this point.
Not sure if it's gonna be real, but I think brother u/kn0thing should see this.
/r/Bitcoin - Censorship resistant currency discussed in a censored forum.
whats sad is people like you embracing a fraudulent bitcoin. 
"Just donate Ver (u/memorydealers) , you asshole.
This is still bribing. "
So if someone offered reddit a charitable 250k to rename this subreddit r/bch you’d also have no problem with that?
"> What he means is that this community is getting toxic

I believe your morals are getting toxic.

These thing are not the same. Do not make a whore out of logic."
Can they ban discussing BCH on /r/BTC then? I mean, it's called BTC yet they only chill BCH...
"Old news? He said it a while ago? 

Also, elsewhere this would be considered bribing... it became a donation to charity simply because the first attempt was an actual proposal to remove the mods for money."
Billions of satoshis, maybe...
Bribery is illegal by definition. 
How people still follow and flock to someone like Ver amazes me everyday. Like literally, not figuratively blows my blockchain sky high. 😂
"How do you ""bribe"" reddit when you're donating the money straight to a charity? Get real clown."
Redditor /u/SilentWarrier has low karma in this subreddit.
Think deeper.
"Offers to make a quarter million dollar charitable contribution in order to stop censorship in rBitcoin and you call him a scumbag.

Well then. We know which side you're on."
80% posts here are anti BTC, you wont find any news here 
people hate on Ver too much. he's a legend in this game and its unfortunate he receives so much disrespect. everyone has their own ideas where this is going and whats going to happen, why must we always divide up and separate into teams? the AI is laughing at us for that... or will be... when they take the fuck over...
