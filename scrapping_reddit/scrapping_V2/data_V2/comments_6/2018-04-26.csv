Well you could not spend from exchanges
lol, I know! Bitcoin with the bigger sized market! lol!
You can tell the BCH investors because we are so damn smart lol. Keep pushing the facts 👍🏽
I am asking a question

BitconEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEct
Are you saying what bitcoin base layer fees are right now or just everything from now since fees rose over a penny apologetics?
Wow bitcoin cash really has trouble using their own name and even their memes are about bitcoin... it’s like bch only survives on pretending it’s something that it’s not
Are you allowed to choose whether you use FIFO or LIFO?  How do you document it?  (Capital gains newbie here.)
"In the store-of-value scenario, people buy when they expect the value to go up, and the value only goes up if *more* people buy. At some point, nobody else will want to buy and it will crash. That is how a pyramid scheme works and it will have the same result.

In the medium-of-exchange scenario, people are constantly buying or exchanging, and the price is supported by its use. That is how money works. It is sustainable.
"
What fees?
Thank you. 
One of many good reasons to unsubscribe to /r/bitcoin is meme noise.  This place isn't much better in that regard.
Purse used to be a thriving upstart until fees killed it. They will be using an alt soon or they will no longer exist.
Need to turn the logo about 30(?) degrees counterclockwise.  Then you can spend and replace.
Me no spend, only hodl 
"As I understand it, yes you can choose, but once you choose a methodology you must stick with it. As for documenting it, I'm not entirely sure, but generally you self-report a cost basis on the capital gains schedule, I'm not really sure if you have to denote methodology at that point or what.

I am not a CPA and this is just my understanding, obviously DYOR and consult a professional."
This is so fucking sad and petty 
but BCH is horse shit.
Because blocks are full.. Right? This reeks like it's just for show. Looky looky we got even bigger blocks now
Hahah I dont know where to start
I'll definitely go buy more.
"I used BCH half a dozen times today.  a handful of donations, tippr, made a couple of posts on memo.cash.  How many BTC transactions did you afford, I mean, make today?

I am sure you are a perfectly decent person IRL, so don't go out of character over some coins.  You like BTC, use it.  You don't have to like BCH."
"Good. Let's not lose momentum again. 

Enable colored coins! It was pushed back because Counterparty Cash was announced and they waged a campaign to ensure that there wasn't any competition to their system in time. 

Since then there has been no movement with Counterparty Cash. The abandoned project only resulted in delaying an integrated token standard within Bitcoin itself. 

Who was behind it anyway? Is it possible that Counterparty Cash was supposed to fail and was just announced in order to delay technological advancements within BCH?"
Sometimes making sense breaks the circlejerk and must be downvoted to save face.
Bad bot
Redditor /u/choose_your_own- has low karma in this subreddit.

32 MB means BCH can handle at least a 100 transactions per second, while BTC (on a good day) 4 transactions per second.
It's called r/btc, cos r/bitcoin is occupied. Blocksized debate predates chain split
Woooo centralization!! PayPal 2.0 is here
I actually thought the code would be too complex for me to follow but after reviewing them I think I agree, they do look quite straightforward. 
\>i-i was only pretending to be a retarded spammer!

"thats the whole point, jihan wants full control of his coin and will not let anyone to even run a full node.

soon we will see jihan&roger spamming bcashes mempool for that. just like he burns miners fees to keep away ppl from bcash mining.

0-conf and no one can run a full node.. this is what bcash offers, a coin that miners(jihan) in control of everything. 

utter bullshit."
"I guess we shall see how ""overwhelming"" it is in the end. I for one don't see a reason for 32MB, can't even fill 1MB right now. "
Take Vers penis out of your mouth, can't understand a word you are saying.
when 1Tb block size?
Fuck yeah. Bitcoin Cash is number one software. It gives the most freedom. 10/10  
Your responses offer nothing but cringe. Keep them coming.
Isn't this opening up the network to attack though? Since fees are so low, it won't take much to fill 32 MB blocks at which point nodes need 4+ GB/day of storage.
"Yes, things that don't exist yet are vaporware. By definition. Do you disagree with the definition?

Following your post history, you're a different breed of troll than normal. I think you'll come around."
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaporware 

va·por·ware
software or hardware that has been advertised but is not yet available to buy, either because it is only a concept or because it is still being written or designed.

Lightning Network meets the definition of vaporware until clients were active on mainnet."
"I see you are now stalking my comment history. Enjoy! 

Are you not aware that they are? I myself bought things using LN, it worked very well. If you read up the thread you will see that the comment relates to the '6 months away' argument. 4 months later - it is live. As I said to you recently elsewhere - go learn some stuff before carrying on - you are not doing to well.

Am I to assume that blocks on BCH over 1 MB are vapourware? I haven't seen any lately. Are you sure the code is live? Even funnier - you are forking to 32MB soon - LOL. Vapour transaction demand ;-)

"CoinDesk is owned by VC-firm Digital Currency Group, which also owns part of Blockstream.

I'm sure people who eventually lost money are satisfied with the apology.
"The post now reads:

>UPDATE: This article has been updated to remove a link to a fraudulent website that was misrepresenting OmiseGo in an effort scam users. CoinDesk regrets the error.

I'll stop pointing out how much of a fraud he is when he stops showing up on the front page of this sub nearly every day.
Its like his day job.

/u/Contrarian__ has a good track record for making every single post about Craig Wright.

"Edit: I didn't understand fully what happened and you won't be able to just from this tweet.

~~While douchey, it is silly to call giveaways scams. I'm not a fan of this new fad of mindlessly calling everything a scam.~~"
"No, it was an outright phishing scam.

This is the article, as originally published:

If you'll notice, the ""official blog"" link pointed to ""omisegotoken.com"", which is a scam phishing website.

The real OmiseGo website is ""omisego.network""

u/vbuterin is right, coindesk is not serious. Don't forget that coindesk is owned by the same group that owns a part, or total, of blockstream, and they removed that disclaimer.
Man, Skinny V is rekting left and right.

Yeah, /u/vbuterin has a good track record on calling out [bad actors who should be shunned](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/89bui6/buterin_about_csw_why_is_this_fraud_allowed_to/).
"Love that Vitalik has integrity.

He is a model example of how a leader figure should be.

See Blockstream ""leaders"" for how **not** to be. Coincidentally, Coindesk is owned by the same company that also funds Blockstream. Coincidence? No."
Thanks for speaking up Vitalik!
