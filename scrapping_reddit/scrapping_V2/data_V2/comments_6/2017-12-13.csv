SegWit2X was an exceedingly poor half-assed attempt.
"> What I definitely do not agree with is artificially restricting block size the way BTC has done

You mean artificially restrict the blocksize as *every* blockchain based cryptocurrency has done, including Bitcoin Cash. 8 MB is also an artificial restriction."
If it were merely Blockstream or Core (not the same thing) holding back Bitcoin, then why wasn't SegWit2x a resounding success?
">Limits are fine, as long as those limits are increased as needed

*COMMENCE THE SHIFTING OF GOALPOSTS.*

>The 8MG BCH limit is a soft limit

Just being a config setting doesn't make it a soft limit. If a miner produced a block larger than 8 MB, the network would reject it, which means it's a hard limit.

>The only other blockchain that is congested is ETH, and they are about to hard fork to increase the block size.

Ethereum is far more reckless with their changes than Bitcoin. Bitcoin Cash does seem to adopt a similar attitude as Ethereum."
"> COMMENCE THE SHIFTING OF GOALPOSTS.

Not really. Blockstream/Core had over two years to fix this and chose not to. 

Thanks for playing.

"Limits are fine, as long as those limits are increased as needed. The 8MG BCH limit is a soft limit. It can be increased to as high as 32MB without a hard fork. It is currently planned to hard-fork as necessary.

The only other blockchain that is congested is ETH, and they are about to hard fork to increase the block size.

Other coins like monero have a dynamic block size."
This is fucking crazy. Blockchair is right, you never pull shit like this in academia or industry. If you think a paper could use some improvements, you propose your own work and write a paper from it, not modify someone else's. 
Lol at your name calling, so childish, and you think bcash will grow with idiots like you supporting 
There are those who are paid to be ignorant, but there are mostly people confused and mislead by the Blockstream's propaganda
I'm curious, I swear I'm not trolling, but what is your opinion of roger ver's past (especially wrt moral bankruptcy)?
"Significant amount of people is VISA level transactions: 2.000 tx pr second. Bitcoin does something like 4 tx/s at 1 mb/10 min. That would equal 500 mb blocks for the same amount of tx/s (VISA *can* handle 24.000 tx pr sec at peak) - and thats just VISA. If you end up with it costing 20k to run a node, then people **will** have to rely on 3rd parties to validate transactions - that introduces trust, and equals centralization.

>  If I have a constantly open channel

(edit: nevermind this, thought you wrote; if I have to constantly open channels) Why would you? You don't need a direct channel with the recipient - it can be routed through lots of other channels.

> that is the same thing as if Lightning Network is a banking service

this has *nothing* to do with banking, other than there being money involved. There are no loans, no interest rates, no money printing, no trust.

> That is a service that is completely redundant simply by having a well developed block chain of adequate size. 

Other than potentially making bitcoin orders of magnitude more efficient for the same blocksize, it gives you much larger degree of privacy (your tx are not directly visible on the blockchain) and instant (!!!) payments - no risk of double spend (as is the case with 0-conf)."
Holy shit how did you reach that conclusion from that?
"it already has case in point Bitcoin Core = a Distal store of value! 

WTF the utility is transacting, recording digital tokens on an immutable ledger. The value people assign to those tokens is subjective, it becomes more valuable the more people use it. 

The value can't be stored digitally only the act of transacting.

This will not end well if core keeps going down this path.

For the record I own both BTC and BCH and would love to see both be successful."
I do for what that's worth. Bitcoin sees less and less real world usage every day, it's just something you hold in order to sell it off to the next sucker for a higher price. If LN etc. does not turn out to work and still be decentralized, it's not looking great for BTC.

"Measuring success by price only is the fatal downfall of Bitcoin. The concept of decentralized **currency** is dead in BTC as it currently stands and yet the community is okay with that because the price is going up and more people are investing (which are very mutual events). As soon as the userbase stops pumping, the price will stagnate, causing the people who invested only for quick gains to cash out and likely causing a major correction if not outright downward spiral. 

When the majority of interest in a concept is coming from the hope of profits, a bubble is formed, and as soon as the price stops going up, the bubble bursts. BCH price being low is arguably a good thing, because it means that the majority of the community has an organic interest in the concept of fast, cheap, secure, decentralized transacting."
When did Btc start and when did bch start, what other crypto has ever been valued at $1500 after 4 months 
"That won't convince them. Since their issue is fundamentally ideological, it doesn't matter how big bitcoin gets, how widely it is adopted, or how it's performance accelerates over time. They will never be open to anything other than the flippening or the cashening, which, while possible, becomes increasingly unlikely the more bitcoin is adopted by the mainstream. 

I also strongly suspect, as others have said before, that at least one of the subs here, either this one or the other one, is actually run by a state that is invested in one of the currencies and avidly looking to guide the conversation. I bet you if reddit did an audit of the IPs here and the account ages, some weird stuff would start popping up. "
"That citation claims that the original bitcoin whitepaper - basically blockchain RFC - ""tricks people into thinking"" something else that Cobra wants it to mean.

It actively lies that the paper is not reference, that there are other versions of it and most blatant lie is that it heavily implies that Satoshi himself approves modifying it (however we have everything on file and no it has never happened).

It also implies that anything promoted by it is a crazy toxic idea. That it is outdated for academic use.

I like how Cobra acknowledges that bitcoin core is diverged from the paper. 

After reading this I'm almost 90% sure Cobra is part of intelligence services just because of the way the post is done. It's like from a Russian KGB propaganda playbook.

Appeal and bending of sanity, intelligence, logic and authority. That's just abuse of that playbook.

"Because peer-reviewed papers are not meant to be modified by anyone, not even the authors themselves. If the author wanted to make a change, he resubmits as a separate paper; this is how it is done in academia to maintain integrity. You don't simply go around modifying people's papers, even if the errors are mere typos.  

Code changes are a different story. Usually, the author reviews the changes before accepting them into the codebase. The situation for Bitcoin is complex because the original author is AFK and the designated guy in charge (Gavin Andresen) got shunned from Core so in a sense, the code changes are without permission. 

Therefore, just because they can make changes to the code itself, does not mean they can rewrite Satoshi's words.

"Its so much more than ""downright unacceptable"", its an attack on intellectual integrity. Even if they were the original author (which they are fucking NOT!) it'd still demonstrate they were intellectually bankrupt and bereft of intellectual honesty or consistency.

Weirdly, I do agree with some points on the bitcoin.org GitHub issue. The terminology is outdated, so it may be confusing for people starting from the whitepaper and then proceeding to the real world. But the point is that I don't trust any change in the whitepaper, by no person or group, to preserve the vision and value proposition of the document. And that, for me, is the most important part: it doesn't really matter for me how the system works, but instead, strives to provide what Bitcoin was supposed to be. Thus the misappropriation of Bitcoin's name by the Bitcoin Segwit chain, as it isn't a peer-to-peer electronic cash system anymore.

How about just keep the fees low like in BCH so we don't need to create solutions to problems that don't need to exist.

Almost all the people reading the paper are probably reading it for the first time, and using it as a learning resource.

There is no mention of things like pools, and the Privacy and SPV sections could probably be updated.

I'ts impossible
I dont think the point was to edit the original whitepaper, but to make a version 2
"impressive stuff 

/u/tippr 0.00000000000000001 BCH"
Where is that last quote from?
"> not modify someone else's.

Why not? They did it to the entire project, the genesis white paper is pretty minor compared to that. I think both are completely insane, but there's little doubt from their perspective having done the one they should obviously do the other. "
bitcoin.org wouldnt dare to change it.
"Wow I read that whole thread.. cobra did propose updating the original because his argument was that it was under the MIT license and if they can change a code they can change the white paper. People naturally disagreed with it and offered solutions.. then Greg Maxwell comes in here saying this is an attack from r/BTC and people are abusing cobra, he ""of course wasn't proposing an update to the original and now people are bullying him and making him not want to create open discussions"". Then someone rational tries to talk to him and explain where the confusion lies and only gets attacked by Greg. It was night and day the way people were earlier  discussing their opinions and reasons as to why they thought that way, and Maxwell changes the entire thread to be an attack and poor cobra didn't mean what you think when cobra never replied to clarify his proposals (it was a proposal and he did want to update the original).

The problem here lies with Greg answering for other people falsely and trying to defend someone because his actions were now receiving backlash. It's like a mother letting her son torture an animal but when other people notice and look down on it, the mother will defend and attack people saying they are wrong and her son never did that! 

So basically Greg Maxwell is a SJW and to shield those on his side which he feels are being attacked, he in turn attacks the opposition and censors them."
So how many of you actually read the github chain of comments this stems from? Pretty much everyone there is sharing the same concerns as you all. The tone is very much about how to appropriately let people know what is different between now and then. Most seem to agree that doing that through means other than touching the original paper is appropriate. Calm down.
Because you can't have 2 same names at the same time. I would think that would be logical.
"You really want to go that path? Alright... SegWit is a drastic change of Bitcoin system, it broke one of the working principles of the Bitcoin system.

Bitcoin Cash (for you propaganda label users) did not change any working principles, block size is not a change of working principles, and in fact has been increasing many times before already.

So just STFU."
Blockstream, the corporation that had its employees infiltrated and hijacked Bitcoin code... oh it has much to do with it.
Why did Bitcoin Cash not keep the name then? 
Block size has stayed the same with BTC and bCash it's changed.
Well, you should rethink your conclusions. The system that works like Bitcoin system is the one that is Bitcoin... name is just a name, and name can be (and has been) hijacked. This is how you come to the truth, and this is what shows that Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin and that SegWit and Lightning are not.
Good thing we actually have a fee market
"Where there is demand markets evolve, where a commodity, in this case block space, is artificially limited, the market always looks for substitutes.

It is a billion dollar enterprise with a business plan that makes it obsolete when people are their own bank and run their own nodes so they only have a chance to survive on centralized chains like bcash."
"Are your favourite movies the ones that no one has seen because they had no funding?  Society clearly values the music of highly paid pop stars.  You and I can value other music, but what the majority likes is what brings in the most money.  No one ever sets out to make a movie to bring in record low profits or to lose money.  

Lol you say that because you have no accomplishments, thats why you are poor.  You came to reddit to elucidate your failures and tell everyone about your welfare living.  You got pretty salty when i asked what you have done to provide worth to the world or yourself, why is that?  I think it is because you lost the argument.  Its sad because you loose out on all kinds of experiences in life being poor.

Did you miss this part, or choose not to respond because it stings too bad?

>Do you not see being on welfare as something you should strive to change, or are you planning on living out the rest of your days on welfare?

>And was it really worth it if you ended up just making your money in bitcoin? Shouldn't you be trying to make up for lost time if you gave up having close friends to go to college and build a career that ended up not really mattering at all now that you don't have to work for a living?

lol, nice false choice.  How does working it bitcoin make me give up having friends?  I made more friends as I met new people along the way every step of my life, while maintaining my previous relationships.  

Really stretching hard to push the no friends narrative aren't you.  Do you have friends that like live on your couch or something.  Or do you have a co-dependent relationship you would be worried about losing if you left your neighborhood for more than 30 minutes?  You may have some type of undiagnosed anxiety disorder, talk to your Dr. about it and get medicated and get out and see the world.  Its beautiful out there, even beyond the walls of your neighborhood.  "

My closest lifelong friend works at a job out of the USA.  Is he selfish for taking that job?  Does it make him a bad person that we have to go on a plane to see him?  Or does that mean that we don't have a real friendship, you can diagnose it based on what you have seen here?

What kind of fantasy world do you live in where taking a 2 hour flight is more of a hassle than giving up 5 million dollars?

Look I get you were upset about me being mean to the other guy, but you are just embarrassing yourself with stupidity here.

>I'm just pointing out that you invited this kind of examination given that you're willing to judge them and their life as pathetic, and then volunteered all this information about your having millions of dollars and not working for a living.

I never said I have no friends, you projected that on me to stick up for the other guy.  The other guy literally asked me not to move so I could pay his (and others) welfare checks.  

And by that logic you have examined me now, so you have then examine you.  How much money do you have?  Tell me more about your co-dependent relationships and the sacrifices you have had to make because you cant leave the city limits there.  Lets hear about what makes you special.

> where they'd actually be able to do this? Are all of your close friends also crypto-millionaires who don't need to work? I though you said they work during the day?

They have this thing called the weekend, holidays, and vacation time.  I could also see them by coming to visit them at their house when I sell the house I currently own in the US.  You have fabricated a non existent problem."
"What about welfarecoin?  Would you be down with that? How about the government dole out a digital currency for welfare recipients?  You don't seem to like the government handing out dollars.  What about if they gave some bitcoin?

Would you like a universal [basic income](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income) of a few satoshi to help the poor?"
"**Basic income**

A basic income (also called basic income guarantee, citizen's income, unconditional basic income, universal basic income (UBI), or universal demogrant) is a form of social security in which all citizens or residents of a country receive a regular, unconditional sum of money, either from a government or some other public institution, independent of any other income. An unconditional income transfer that is considered insufficient to meet a person's basic needs (or below the poverty line), is sometimes called a partial basic income, while one at or greater than that level is sometimes called a full basic income. Besides national basic income, full or partial, it can also be local or regional basic income. Some welfare systems are more or less related to basic income but also have some strings and/or are restricted to ""The poor"" in a region.

Woosh. You missed that beautiful analogy, but what can I expect from a dirty Corey.

Firstly, if by ""rejection of both of you"" you mean ""a rejection of both of your positions"" then that would be unwarranted. I haven't given a position for you to reject, I've only given you a representation of /u/GayloRen's position.

Secondly, if you mean to reject ....

... by having your post stand (""my post stands""), you need to either:

* Hold that the claim entails the view that  in the debate neither ""manipulated heavily"" nor that (unjust) censorship has taken place; or
* Agree that the claim doesn't entail that view.

You've done neither.

Thirdly, if you mean to reject it by calling this ""concern trolling"" and you mean a ""concern troll is someone who is on one side of the discussion, but pretends to be a supporter of the other side with ""concerns"" (https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=concern%20troll) then this is just repeating a basic intellectual dishonesty by engaging in the fallacy of [an appeal to motive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_motive).

I don't necessarily think you're speaking too well for him. So I was disagreeing with you. But *if* that is indeed what he would say, then yes, my post stands as a rejection of both of you.

"Making money is a huge part of being successful.  Who is someone who has made a bunch of money that is not successful in some way?   Sure. some people inherit their money and get the easy path in life.  Life's not fair, learned that a long time ago.  But for people who made their own money, who got rich themselves and is not successful at all?

I can imagine why you would feel that way, from my perspective you are rationalizing your condition to make your reality seem less painful.  

> I have no interest in your personal life.

You literally responded to a comment where I was talking about making a move in my personal life to start this whole thread.  You said you care that I pay taxes to support your welfare, keep up son.

Enjoy the welfare and poverty and aids and other stuff you poor people deal with all the time I guess.  Hope you don't run out of money for the internet bill or power or whatever, or is that socialized in Australia for poorfags now too?"
">It's just interesting that you so freely call out someone on the internet collecting welfare as being pathetic, but you don't seem to have any awareness of the lack of strong social ties in your life.

Oh, now i get it!   You dont care about me paying taxes, rather you are upset that I gave the welfare guy a hard time.  So you make up some side story about how now apparently I cant even call anyone on the phone, lol.  What a white knight you are coming to the welfare dudes defense!  

> I wouldn't trade my social circle of friends for your 10 million dollars, especially if you told me I could keep 5 million to stay put. I am rich in close friends. If I was having a horrible day and needed a friend, I could pick up the phone and call one of a half dozen people who would drop what they're doing and come be with me, listen to my problems, and be my friend. And they know they can call me and I would do the same thing. You clearly don't have this in your life, or if you do you don't appreciate it.

Wut. How would moving to a different area effect calling someone on the phone?  Did you think this through at all before posting?  I have a few very close friends that I speak to almost every day on the phone. Are you sure you have friends or are you projecting your problems onto me?  Do you know how many people you can fly to be with you and how many times you can fly to be with someone when you have millions of dollars to allocate for travel?

Saying I cant call people on the phone is here is pretty much the definition of a baseless accusation.  But I get it, its an emotional response to defend the other guy.  How noble of you.

"When I graduated high school I moved to go to college.  That was the next logical step in my life and I chose a college that wasn't in my home town.  Does that make me socially poor?

When I graduated college I moved to a different state, to the best job offer I got.  I could have stayed at my job I had all through college and hung out with my buddies that majored in drugs and alcohol and needed extra years to graduate.  But I moved on and got the best job I could get.  Does that make me socially poor?

I just don't understand why you would think I don't have a strong community around me when I would frequently returning to the community to visit.  With the tax savings, I could afford to fly them down to see me when ever they wanted to come.  

It seems to me like you do care about me paying taxes.  You seem bitter that I would consider leaving so you try to insult me by saying that I have no friends or family or social ties or something to that effect.  And I don't really see the basis in that, as I have said multiple times that I would be back to visit the USA frequently, just like roger frequently comes to the US to give speeches and visit.  Moving there is for the paperwork and tax advantages, you don't have to physically spend all your time on the island.  "

I escaped as a refugee to Australia at about the same time I realised I was transgender. I'm not sure what happened to the rest of my immediate family. I was infected by HIV and my former partner suffers from a disability that I cannot deal with at the moment. I faced discrimination at work numerous times and my meagre life-savings were stolen in a banking scam I was tricked into several years ago.  My landlord will not fix the hole in the roof and in winter our electricity bill is really high. I can't afford a vehicle to get to work or even a pre-paid mobile device. My resume doesn't compare very well with a large pool of competitors and I have recently been diagnosed as diabetic.

Note:  This is not true or somewhat true.  This was made up to provide an example of relevant personal information which was repeatedly demanded by another redditor as part of the discussion on welfare.

"Lots of wealthy people choose to forgo their citizenship to save money, thats why I am looking into it.  Many people stay too, but they have things holding them here.  I dont own a company here, I dont have much family that lives in the US, I have nothing holding me here.

The citizenship is through the Caribbean country, but you don't have to live there.  Rogers citizenship is through stkits i believe and he lives in japan.  I have friends and family that live around the world, I would probably spend lots of time visiting them too.  

You seem smart enough to know that 10 million is twice as much as 5 million.  Sure, I could stay and have half but why wouldn't I at least consider having double and living an extravagant lifestyle?  

With 10 million Canadian you can get an investment visa and live in Canada too.  I would probably do that when i got tired of the sun, or when hurricanes were coming through.

Im hoping you will hold yourself to a higher standard and do something with your life instead of just sit there and collect welfare while trolling reddit.  I was born poor, but I worked hard, put myself through college, worked shitty jobs to pay for the college, paid off my debt, and invested in bitcoin.  You can get rich too, you just need a good attitude, work ethic, and responsible money management.  Give up the defeatist attitude and I bet you will be giving up the welfare in no time at all.

I don't care about your taxes.  It just seems like you have a ton of money and yet you don't have a strong community around you.  You're financially rich and socially poor.
"Cause you edited the last post, when I was 6 youtube wasn't even a thing.

I wish I had made 11 million at 6 years old, good for that kid.  

If I had a problem where I couldn't support myself and I relied on others, I might even reach out to someone like that kid and try to learn from him so i wouldn't be such a deadbeat sucking resources off society while contributing noting.  "
"As a third party its clear that your hasty accusation ""You fundamentally misunderstand the situation"" applied to yourself. You've misunderstood /u/GayloRen's position.

/u/GayloRen's position has several prongs:

* There is a debate over the merits of BTC versus BCH. 
* This debate is important.
* Because the debate is important it should be conducted  at the level of the merits of each.
*  Because the debate is important it should not be conducted in an intellectually dishonest manner.
* The debate becomes intellectually dishonest and ""petty"" when carried out at the level of accusations of motive or hidden agendas.

There's nothing contradictory about this position.

"Yes, I posted a link to explain that bitcoin is only incidentally libertarian.  A libertarian creating a libertarian fantasy would have made it clear they were libertarian.  Satoshi Nakamoto did no such thing.

What badge of honour?  What did you think you might achieve by poor-shaming someone?"
"**Appeal to motive**

Appeal to motive is a pattern of argument which consists in challenging a thesis by calling into question the motives of its proposer. It can be considered as a special case of the ad hominem circumstantial argument. As such, this type of argument may be an informal fallacy.

A common feature of appeals to motive is that only the possibility of a motive (however small) is shown, without showing the motive actually existed or, if the motive did exist, that the motive played a role in forming the argument and its conclusion.

I don't care what reason people make movies for.  Likewise for music.  I haven't paid for movie or music or tv since 2001.  I share and take digital copies to my hearts content.  So whether or not a movie or music makes profit is inconsequential.  I would never ever equate success with money making.  I understand that creativity emerges and flows irregardless of money.

Did you hear Oprah say ""You can get rich too""?  Why aren't you as rich as her?  I guess your attitude is too poor, your work ethic is lacking and you can't manage your money responsibly.  Can you?  After all you don't have as much wealth as her.  She did it.  Why can't you?

Give up the elitist attitude.  You are exhibiting the worst of the worst bitcoiner's trait."
"Countless millions of people around the world receive all kinds of welfare.  These people do not give a flying hootenanny about what anyone else thinks of this.  The people that do not like others receiving welfare can't stick it where the sun don't shine because it is just too bad for them.

Please do go on and tell me what you think about people taking welfare.  I want to know exactly how you feel.  I would take as much welfare as I can get if I needed it and never ever think twice about it.  This is my entitlement.  I absolutely love working for money.  Working is perhaps my greatest joy.

I bet you are one of those people who believes in ""earning a living"" or some shit like that.  Please be sure to pay your taxes accurately and promptly, lest you be considered a leach on society.

TL;DR Taxes, governments and welfare are here to stay.  Don't like it, then build a rocket.
"
"“I have so much money I am considering moving for tax advantages.  That’s not pathetic.”

I’m always surprised when I see people who are so willing and able to uproot their lives. Do you not have any connections to your community?  No friends or family whose physical proximity matters to you?  You say you have lots of money, do you not have enough to stay where you are and love a comfortable life regardless of the taxes? How much more would you need to be able to afford to stay where you are now?

My most valuable assets are my friends.  If I was living off of capital gains I would be so blessed, I could spend more time being with the people I care about.

Not to mention if my income was from capital gains, my tax rate would be cut in half.  You are so fortunate to be paying much less than those who still work for an income.  Don’t you agree?"
"I don't need luck.  I just need to see ""I accept Bitcoin Cash"" signs.

People who speculate about things and then invest in assets that have no utility, need all the luck they can muster."
You're concern trolling. I get it. It's simple and far too often effective.
"Look, we measure value with money.  Oprah has more money than me, she has more power and value in the world than me.  I could probably learn alot from Oprah about how to increase my wealth (and i could probably learn how to increase my waistline as well from her).  If you want to improve upon your condition, you may want to learn from others too.  Life is a game, and the quality of your living depends on your ability to play the game.  

So what have you done with your life.  What super great accomplishments have you done, aside from signing up for welfare programs to support yourself? lulz

Why would I change my attitude?  It got me here, and im happy with it.  You are the one that needs change, because without social programs holding you up and meeting your basic human needs you wouldn't even be alive.  

Do you not see being on welfare as something you should strive to change, or are you planning on living out the rest of your days on welfare?"
"Yeah, I read your posts and I though it was funny to see what kind of people make up the 100,000+ people that read this sub.  Apparently there are less libertarians than i though, and more welfare mooches that I though.  

Anyways, I was questioning your own value to society.  Its ok because I know you poor people have bad educations and you don't have strong reading comprehension because of poverty and white people keeping you down.  

You know Roger holds btc too right?  

Why do you hang out here if you hate bitcoin and liberty so much and have such a hard on for government?"
"I know that too many people in Australia get welfare.  🔚. If I lived in Australia I would leave for the same reasons I am leaving the US.  I refuse to pay for bullshit for people like you.

TAXPAYERS are coughing up $300,000 a minute for a welfare bill that has soared $40 billion in 10 years.

The Herald Sun can reveal that the total lifetime welfare bill for all those currently receiving benefits has been estimated at $2.1 trillion.

The frightening figure emerged as federal government debt reached a record $506 billion yesterday, renewing concerns about the public cost of supporting those who game the system or are locked into a cycle of welfare dependency.

Remarkably, anyone currently receiving government help to study is expected to be on welfare for nearly half of the rest of their lives, costing taxpayers an average of $247,000.

Hilarious that you spent time going through my old posts too, wasting your time like that is why you are poor and on welfare.  "
"Nah, everything that's been presented to you has been rational. You mischaractarize it in order to minimize the disagreement and particularly the nefariousness of the other side. It's a classic troll. And the fact that you can't even produce the supposed instigating comment which sparked your ""concern"" only cements the fact. You're not only trolling -- you're lying."
Hey Roger check out this deadbeat.  He is telling you what I think, apparently.  What is up with this surprise?

">  a deadbeat sucking resources off society while contributing noting

And this is what you are feeling really bad about.  The fundamental reason you are lashing out at me.

You got rich by doing nothing.  However you understand that Bitcoin has dangerous externalities that others will pay for.  You can also see the price of BCH is remaining solid, adoption is growing and its grassroots support is strong.

Bitcoin (BTC) is for deadbeats that suck resources off society while contributing nothing.

In making that statement I create an analogy.  With many people rushing into Bitcoin to get rich quick the statement I made could be said for the wave of current and future speculators in the broadest most demeaning way. Lets hope Bitcoin Cash holders are a little more refined.

Do you think the first 10 million millionaires on the planet should have priority over the bottom 99% of current wealth owners when it comes to speculating on Bitcoin?

How can the high fees with BTC help the poor help themselves?"
"Sure thing, bud.

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7jax1o/i_roger_ver_will_be_doing_an_ama_on_monday_dec/dr6u1b3/), I was accused of being a concern troll simply because I said that debate should be rational instead of being a petty argument between rivals."
"lmao, I took my capital and took a risk.  I researched, I mined, I spread bitcoin around.  My friends and family told me I was crazy and bitcoin would destroy my finances, but they were wrong and I was right.  It took balls, it for sure wasn't ""doing nothing.""  

/u/memorydealers get a load of this guy.  He thinks early bitcoin adopters are deadbeats and apparently hates bitcoiners and libertarian philosophy, yet he hangs out in this sub.  Whats up with that? LOL"
"Lol, sure i bet that is all true.  Well, that was awfully nice of Australia to take you in when you needed help real bad, wasn't it.  You should consider yourself lucky, Im sure most people in your situation would be dead many times over.  You should repay the citizens by getting off reddit and going to do anything at all to contribute to society.  

If your former partner has a disability, why is it your problem to deal with at the moment?  Why did you let yourself get scammed at the bank, thats back to the poor money management skills we talked about earlier.

"you should read Charlie Stross:

http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2013/12/why-i-want-bitcoin-to-die-in-a.html

BitCoin looks like it was designed as a weapon intended to damage central banking and money issuing banks, with a Libertarian political agenda in mind—to damage states ability to collect tax and monitor their citizens financial transactions.

You like bitcoin and you call welfare a modern miracle, lol, you are so confused.  No wonder you cant get a job!

Good luck with the welfare though.  You should create for yourself if there are no open jobs.  Get off reddit and go be productive if you are really poor as fuck and living off the government handouts, lol.   Glad I wont be paying for any of it, thats for sure!"
No. I'm debating your stupid interjection, not Gayloren's post. 
"Also, I went to college, have a successful career making a comfortable living, and still managed to grow a close circle of friends.  Why didn't you?

And was it really worth it if you ended up just making your money in bitcoin?  Shouldn't you be trying to make up for lost time if you gave up having close friends to go to college and build a career that ended up not really mattering at all now that you don't have to work for a living?"
"No, I really don't care about your taxes.  It's just interesting that you so freely call out someone on the internet collecting welfare as being pathetic, but you don't seem to have any awareness of the lack of strong social ties in your life.

I wouldn't trade my social circle of friends for your 10 million dollars, especially if you told me I could keep 5 million to stay put.  I am rich in close friends.  If I was having a horrible day and needed a friend, I could pick up the phone and call one of a half dozen people who would drop what they're doing and come be with me, listen to my problems, and be my friend.  And they know they can call me and I would do the same thing.  You clearly don't have this in your life, or if you do you don't appreciate it.  It's obvious to anyone that ""visiting (the Caribbean) anytime they want"" is a very lonely way to keep your friends.  ""Hey I need a friend, go to the airport and fly 12 hours to come visit!"".  If that's your idea of close friendship then you must not have any truly close friends.

I don't think you're pathetic because you don't have this.  I just think it's sad.  But hey at least you have 10 million dollars to keep you company in the Caribbean and don't have to worry about poor people claiming welfare funded by your money.  That's something I guess. "
"You know that I would be able to come back to the US on a visa, like roger, to see my friends and family?  The people I know are all working all day anyways, Its not like they can come over to my place to hang out all day now anyways.  And they would all be welcome to visit my Caribbean home too.

I have made over 10 million on crypto so it would save me millions of dollars moving for tax reasons like roger did.  Of course I could stay put and pay taxes, but it would be stupid not to at least consider moving to save money.  "

In my county the government does a horrible job of administrating the criminal justice system.  They brutalize the citizens with no recourse, killing citizens at a record pace recently (including an Australian woman who called them for help, you may have heard about that.)

The FDA who enforces food laws is bloated and not cost effective.

And when I pay taxes my country uses most of the money to buy bombs to drop on brown people.  

Thats why I don't want to pay.  Is that clear to you? Anything unreasonable in that?

"Seems like he goes some way to address his statement in the videos description:

>This video was made 7 months before the collapse of MTGOX. At that time, MTGOX was experiencing no delays with Bitcoin. Their only problems at that time were with fiat withdrawals. While I regret having made this video for MTGOX, everything stated in the video was factually correct, even with everything we know today. I simply stated that the withdrawal delays were not being caused by a lack of liquidity. I made no claims as to whether or not MTGOX was solvent or not."
"I mean we upvoted the guy asking the hard question, didn't we? Or is it disgusting that Roger hasn't responded yet? Even though this isn't the AMA.

It's also a leading question. ""why did you lie about mt gox?"" How am I supposed to know the context of the question? The OP should provide quotes and context if he's going to accuse someone of lying"

In hindsight, I regret having made it for them, but everything I said in the video, even with what we know today, was factually true. I saw with my own eyes bank account balances with about $100M USD. I saw with my own eyes a letter from the bank limiting MTGOX to 10 international wire transfers per day, and 100M JPY in domestic transfers per day. At the time the video was made, there wasn't even a suspicion that MTGOX didn't have everyone's bitcoins, and I made no effort to verify their Bitcoin holdings in any way. The MTGOX Bankruptcy didn't come until seven months later. I'm very sorry for having made the video."

Yea well. This proposition is too common a tactic to bother with - no doubt you think ""being fooled"" will cause FUD - maybe it will for less informed readers.

"Well first of all, fiat is still around.  Most people are paid in fiat.  We are a long ways away from fiat being spent if it's just ""laying around"".  In the future, when fiat is gone, people will have to use crypto for consumable purchases.  Right now, because bitcoin is gaining in value, it would be like the equivalent of using a Ferrari for Uber rides. If you can't understand it at this point, I doubt I can help you."

He's not throwing money away...he's just lying...all the shill are in it for the money! I bet he can't even show us one recent and confirmed transaction.
Even if it was ready in 18 months, it will be years and years before it has the same support that Bitcoin has (had?) with merchants. And let's be realistic, the boat may have sailed by then. Good job Core for pushing merchants to a different blockchain.
Yeah, but the kind of person buying Bitcoin just to speculate on it isn't likely to know or care about that.
No you're just lying
Salty because you're throwing money away with the fees? I don't understand.
Wouldn't hold your breath.

Yeah hopefully that will provide the relief it's meant to. I just think with the situation this dire action should have been taken a long time ago. Provide some relief now and work on the long term solution in the long term. 
Just 18 months (tm), right?
"You could probably buy $0.20 worth of Bitcoin, as long as you don't try to take it off the exchange or do anything with it. And then you can sell for $0.30 on that same exchange and withdraw your cents. And hope you don't have to pay too much in fiat transaction fees.

I mean.. it makes cents, right?"
If he used it every day for actual, real transactions (not on an exchange), he wouldn't be defending it.
not sure how that applies to mining inefficiency and long transaction times.

But exactly who is to say those uses (for which it can not be replace with something cheaper) are greater or less than the technical value of bitcoin?

My point since the beginning of the discussion :) See [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7jivvf/there_is_a_word_for_a_store_of_value_with_no/dr70qg7/) for a more detailed view of mine."
"OMG sorry. I completely misread your post. I read ""ten thousand years *before* jewelry"". I even quoted it :D Apologies again.

Let's start anew:

That's exactly my point. Gold coins have nothing to do with jewelry. When the whole ""gold standard"" idea started, which I think we can agree is when the first coins were issued, gold had been already known for a long time. At the time, it was no more a store of value than a Lamborghini is today: it was a status symbol. Now, when commerce among distant cities and states skyrocketed (6th century BC), people needed something they could **store** (important: not **exchange**) and carry on in their travels. It is important to notice that day-to-day trade was conducted with barter up until the XV century. Gold was never used as a mean of exchange: no one used gold coins to ""buy a coffee"", or copper either. Gold was just the best candidate because it was present in a limited amount, it was easy to manufacture (which now we agree had been known for 5 millennia) and could ""compact"" value in a small weight. Also, no one used to think about making jewelry out of their coins: if anything, it was the other way round. Basically, the gold coin lost all its connection to being pretty or useful. In fact, just as we hold gold bars as a store of value, we also have platinum bars today, or rough diamonds. Just as the gold coins of the past, what all these things have in common is that they are supplied in limited amounts. Basically, they're all ""collectibles""."
"Well; Bitcoin doesn't exist anymore. Core (soft)forked that into some kind of alt-coin that has nothing to do with Bitcoin. We shall call that coin SegWitCoin or Bcore (BeanieBabyCoin?).

There is a straight line from Bitcoin until and after it upgraded to Bitcoin Cash though. "
With the exception that gold has been a store of value for millenniums and has a magnitude less volitivity. I would not trust any cryptocurrency to not crash to zero, I got into Bitcoin because It could actually be used as an efficient medium of exchange. Currently btc is the best network for that with the least favorable characteristics. A frictionless market will not put up with that for long.
"No, no. I get what you are saying but I cannot agree with that.

Price of an object depends on (i)demand, and (ii) supply. Scarcity only deals with one of those aspects. Scarcity has no effect on demand by itself. The demand for gold came because of its utility as a currency (beginning at Egypt circa. 500 BC) and because of its use in jewellery .

Some of it's properties made Gold extremely useful as a currency - such as being fungible, malleable, easy to move, and being resistant to corrosion, etc. Those properties made gold a proper utility and that brought demand; and that demand, coupled with low supply, made gold extremely valuable.

Coming to Bitcoin now, Bitcoin does not share some of those essential properties of gold that made it suitable as a currency. (i) Bitcoin is not truly fungible, and (ii) Bitcoin does not share the non-corrosive property of gold (as some of is ""wasted away"" every time you try use it). That makes Bitcoin unsuitable for usage as a currency. The only remaining use-case of Bitcoin, barring that, I can think of is transferring large amounts of wealth between borders/jurisdictions without documentation. While that is a valid use case, it serves a very small niche of the world's population. If demand comes primarily from that, Bitcoin (BTC) is probably very over-valued at this point.
"
">> Gold coins came along something like ten thousand years after jewellery. FYI.

> Huh? The first ""gold"" coin (actually an alloy of silver and gold) dates back to the 6th century BC, while gold jewels were already manufactured in Egypt in 5000 BC.

Excuse me.   Let me issue a correction then.

""Gold coins came along something like ~~ten~~ five thousand years after jewellery. FYI.""

There, now will you agree with the rest of my argument?"
No, I mean Bitcoin, not bitcoin cash. I'm not trolling here. I hold both, but BCH didn't even exist until August of this year.
That's what gold does today.
"> Iridium, Osmium, Rhenium, Ruthenium, and Rhodium are all more scarce than Gold. Yet, of them, only one metal (Rhodium) is more valuable than gold.

Obviously when you discover a metal 2500 years too late you might have some difficulties to replace a standard. Ruthenium has less demand than gold just because it's not a standard.

Scarcity being the defining property of a store of value doesn't mean it's the only one. Tradition may as well be another important one, for example, and that possibly explains why people are not (yet) migrating from Bitcoin to Ethereum."
"> Gold coins came along something like ten thousand years after jewellery. FYI.

Huh? The first ""gold"" coin (actually an alloy of silver and gold) [dates back to the 6th century BC](https://nationalcoinbroker.com/investor-services/history-of-gold-coins/), while gold jewels were [already manufactured in Egypt in 5000 BC](https://www.ancient.eu/gold/). If you wish to display your ignorance, at least try not to be arrogant too. (Edit: and I should learn to read)

> praseodymium standard

The fact that unlike praseodymium, gold can easily be forged into a coin obviously played a significant role. You can compare that to the ease of converting electrical power to bitcoin, if you wish."
Do you mean Digicash? That wasn't trustless.
But what good is hodling, if you can't spend it? Yes you get a warm fuzzy feeling looking at blockfolio, but if you can't spend it on items, then you have to transfer it to filthy fiat to actually get something that changes your life.
"> gold's true value is in its scarcity.

There are lots of things that are scarce but are not a good store of value.

Iridium, Osmium, Rhenium, Ruthenium, and Rhodium are all more scarce than Gold. Yet, of them, only one metal (Rhodium) is more valuable than gold.

That would suggest that mere scarcity doesn't give something value. 

Scarcity will cause something to have a high value only when there is enough demand for it. Demand comes from the number of use cases a particular product can serve. As of now, Bitcoin (BTC) has extremely limited use cases.
"
"Gold coins came along something like ten thousand years after jewellery.  FYI.

>Once again, gold's transactional utility resided in its scarcity.

That's just wrong. If that were true then we'd all be taking about the praseodymium standard. Something doesn't become easier to transact because it's less available."

"Right, but gold was prized because it was pretty and workable into jewelry that made you look prettier.

Bitcoin BTC is prized because why?  Is it pretty?  Does it make you look prettier?  Can you eat one, or make a transistor out of it?

No, it was (originally) prized because it had underlying transactional utility - it's like gold *you can teleport nearly instantly nearly for free.*

Take the cheap, fast teleportation away, you got a tulip.

In short, people hoard things because they have value.  Things do not have value because people hoard them, although this does occur in short term fads (tulips, Beanie Babies, pet rocks, etc.)"
"Well, he said *move* it.

Some gold may be lost when transforming it from one shape to another. Just moving it wouldn't do that. :)"
I don't want to insult you but yes I do. 
Go on...
">I think you have misconceptions in transfer fee. 

What makes you think that? Where did I say anything linking tx fee and market cap?  

Edit: as for difficulty to use, increase in fees will increase the difficulty since now you need to calculate how large the tx will be, and figure out how many sat/byte you need to have the tx processed in time. Hope you don't miscalculate and overpay or have your tx pruned from the mempools. Not much that devs can do to fix this other than reducing fees.

As well if you keep coins in separate addresses, combining these increases the tx size -> fees increase. If fees get too high many of these addresses with ""dust"" will be effectively dead. "
I think it's funny that Andreas Antonopoulos never actually bought any Bitcoin, and I'd imagine he spent some of that recently donated BTC to buy BCH.

"> Right, but gold was prized because it was pretty and workable into jewelry that made you look prettier.

Maybe at the beginning, though the first gold coins I have in mind had little to do with being pretty. They had much more to do with being scarce.

> Bitcoin BTC is prized because why? Is it pretty? Does it make you look prettier? Can you eat one, or make a transistor out of it?

Considering how some hodlers' life have changed, I can argue that yes, they make you prettier. Jokes aside, I still don't believe a gold coin is prettier than a copper one. The jewelry you make out of gold is probably irrelevant as a store of value: again, gold's true value is in its scarcity.

> No, it was (originally) prized because it had underlying transactional utility - it's like gold you can teleport nearly instantly nearly for free.

Once again, gold's transactional utility resided in its scarcity.

Don't make me wrong, I perfectly understand your point. I'm just arguing that gold was a collectible too, and it still was used as a store of value. Which I absolutely don't want bitcoin to become: I want it to be a currency."
Fixed.
bitcoin cash blcks don't get full, so there is no need to outcomete others and hence no need for high fees
Debeers diamonds was a scam perpetuated onto the world
Gotta transect them once ! 
Does that Make Diamonds Collectibles? i see a lot of people comparing BTC to gold when its much more akin to Diamonds. Pretty diamonds that are hugely valuable have no utility. its their ugly cousins that have the useful properties. The only value pretty diamonds have is that society has accepted that their valuable because everyone thinks their valuable. That's exactly the case with BTC, it has value because people accept that it has value. BTC actually has more practical uses than those pretty diamonds.

If you think block chain is not an underlying utility I'm not sure what to tell you.

Bitcoin is in a situation that's **worse** than merely [having no underlying utility.](http://i.thinimg.com/img/2339.png)
"You spelled ""dollar"" incorrectly."
The underlying utility of gold is surprisingly minimal if you bother to think about it. 
"Not really. If you think of it like this, then the USD is an ""item worth collecting,"" and every single currency, crypto or otherwise, would be defined as a ""collectible"". You therefore aren't really making a statement about one specific cryptocurrency, but rather a general statement about currency in general.

The definition of collectible is *not* ""a store of value"". The definition is ""something worth collecting"". The word you're looking for is *asset*

I think the truth behind what you're saying is that BTC is more of a fixed asset, whereas BCH is more of a liquid asset, but that wouldn't be as hyperbolic and convenient."
I believe the Tamagotchi digital pet was the 'worlds first' digital pet rock or beanie baby, followed rapidly by Pokémon and other knockoffs of Pokémon. Collectable digital players or heroes are now standard for many online games. This (Bitcoin) is the first 'pretend digital money' to gain widespread recognition. It fails at being money, because its hard and expensive to exchange it for anything, but people sure like to hoard and speculate on it. Its not a collectable in the traditional sense, since Bitcoin in RL is still not even 1/10th as cool as a beanie baby. Try showing your mother's friend your paper wallet of bitcoin, and prepare to be laughed at, since it looks like a printout of a bunch of computer gobbeldegook that it is, and that would be one of the geekiest thing you could do with a normal person...
Please use this graphic for reference. I know BCH will have smart contracts one day, as of now it doesnt. Link: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DQ8H-H7VAAItOFA.jpg:large
One world currency - sounds familiar?
"Collectible, store of value, Medium of Exchange, Unit of Account

In that order"
This makes Bitcoin's price extremely fragile.  In the past, there was a limited supply.  Now that other crypto currencies have been created, there is almost no supply limit for coins in general.  Some collectables are beautiful.
"Cowrie shells.

Salt wheels.

When is someone creating a digital pet rock in the block chain.  If it works for kitties!!
I think we all agree gold is a collectible. That did not prevent it to become a standard.
Gotta catch em all
Exactly, an investment always has a primary function which you can refer to. Basically anything in the world can be applied as a store of value, so when you someone says that the purpose of bitcoin is in its store of value, they are not wrong they are just misleading. its a currency.
