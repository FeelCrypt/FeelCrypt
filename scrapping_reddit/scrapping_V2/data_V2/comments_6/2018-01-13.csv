You are right of course. I was just being facetious.
Yeah, that was a cluster.  But I think when it comes to taking away something like one's money or ability to invest and earn money, we would witness an uprising.  It won't just be a few scattered protests and letters to representatives like it was with net neutrality.
wtf you just said? I'm trying to decipher but it is been hard af
And then they would do it anyway. :-P Look at net neutrality.
They manipulate the price of a decentralized currency with no formal affiliation with the country though. 
Sorry, I don't think cryptocurrence will be adopted in China, I mean never. If you mean the cryptocurrence is issued by the country, then there is possibility. 
Atomic swaps will help those who want crypto soon. 
I bought some (many thousands) a few years ago and then basically learned about them right away and then sold for what I bought in for.  I kinda wish I didn't sell them because I paid essentially nothing and coulda made quite a bit off it, but I sold out of principle.  I'll never own them again even if there is a chance they will go up.  There are plenty of coins that aren't doing stuff like they are and still have a lot of upward potential.

"You're right, math must be hard for you.

Please, as an exercise, calculate how many more transactions can go in an 8mb block than can in a 1mb block with segwit. Then increase your calculations to see how many go in a 32mb block (which is the limit coded into BCH, 8mb is a soft limit easily removed). Then calculate how much later fees will rise on those larger block sizes, using an average of the rise of fees from BTC on their 1mb block ,extrapolated out to 8 then 32mb.

Your solution, if correct, will show that your statement that BCH fees will moon before currency is false.

Thank you, class dismissed."

Ok.
"Oh yeah cause that makes fucking sense.  Because a platform a few months old handling 15000 transactions a day has a claim to the brand people have stood behind for almost a decade and does 25000 transactions an hour.  

Bcash will continue to be until the pet project is boring to its puppet master.  Or their devs leave when it can't scale.  "
Core doesn't support segwit. Why not? 
They tried that. It took years of bickering and negotiating before Bitcoin Cash folk decided it'd just be better to leave that nightmare.
I personally agree with you and think that would be the best solution BTC and BCH shouldn't be enemies,we should focus on the common enemy and that is whoever wants crypto currency to become extinct.
Value is about zero, the price is high though ü§ì. But it would probably be very bad if it crashed quickly.
It gives me very little faith in core that they (and you) swear segwit is the cure to all our ills, but it's taken them this long to support it?  Why?  Don't they care abut the network?  Are the incompetent or malicious?  Either way I don't trust them anymore.

If there's no drama BCH will die a slow death, if it was a project of value they wouldn't care less about BTC, but it's not, it's a Bitcoin copy-pasterino with bigger blocks that thrives on marketing and drama.
because btc is trying to ruin the name bitcoin
"BTC and BCH follow two different political visions. BTC is trying to onboard a certain part of the market via layer 2, while BCH is more anarcho-capitalistic with a more extreme restructuring of the world order as its vision.

Thank you. This r/btc echo chamber can‚Äôt even get simple shit right, let alone have the wear withal to understand how their scaling solution is good for the moment, but very short sighted.  It‚Äôs an effective propaganda machine, nothing else  
Just wait for them to list XRP next week and all of the money will flow out of BTC and into XRP.
That would be the end of Coinbase, not BTC.
Gotta say I find it ironic that the top post on r/btc is overtly anti-BTC. Strange times.
"I don't belive segwit is the cure of all bitcoin ills, actually, i'd prefer than the 1MB block limit to be removed (not increased, removed), and the sidechains scalability proposals, such as lightning, implemented

Although, RaiBlocks solve all of this and using less energy... So i belive in Ray much more than bitcoin now

About core supporting segwit, well, they just started working on it after the BIP was activated, which could have been done before, but... well... it wasn't

so they are working on it, you can see it on [bitcoin's github](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin), it's [been done](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/milestone/30), but, they're not rushing"

"I'm starting to lose faith in Bitcoin Core/Legacy.  I purchased a couple when they were $30 and held onto them to this day.  Seems there was not much thought to what would happen if the entire point of why it was created was ever realized.  Luckily, since I've held onto Bitcoin so long, I also own the equivalent of Bitcoin Cash.

I fear Bitcoin will become the MySpace of cryptocurrencies.

I just don't understand how the other currencies will deal with the issues Bitcoin is going through.  Bitcoin Cash seems confident the increase blocksize is the solution.

This is all giving me a massive headache."

How would I feel?"
"Coinbase support BCH if smart   
 
BTC support costs higher, e.g. transaction batching, complex segwit few use.. BTC community offensive, selfish and thankless, bad for Coinbase image.   

My guess is Coinbase is smart, it's a process, takes time

This is bad advice duck, which basically is ment with a sense of sarcasm. Therefor this meme is actually PRO BTC. Just my 2 cents...

Marvelous idea. 
Argument from authority?
Ah, [proof by assertion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_assertion).
Nothing. Both trends will continue: frustration posts and let's-stop-talking posts
"Thanks Mate. There are jerks in both communities and there are also excellent people like you. 

I don't mean that you need to pump a coin that you personally don't believe in. I mean that we should tone down the rhetoric a bit. In real life we would have a beer with each other, but here we take joy if the same guy loses money in a price drop.

People like you restore faith in our joint mission. 
"
No, it isn't. That's just it. You are committing the false equivalency fallacy and simply not listening. The evidence of Core's incompetence if not malice is all over this sub, and it's overwhelming.
"You will at some point discover that it's true, that the narrative that he believes - that BCH is a scam run by morons for morons - is nothing but a propaganda talking point that is bought into without any scrutiny. Meanwhile, this same poster is completely eluded when his preferred side fails the very same criteria to a much greater degree; here, suddenly, he fails to observe in the same way as previously.

And so it is not just an empty statement. Someone who naively believes the above narrative can rightly be said to be brainwashed."
But this sub is anti-Bitcoin...
the typical BHC poster everyone, calling brainwashing on the first line..
Some of that happened. But it was a fairly low-effort if they wanted to keep it going.
"Completely agree.

BTC is like a gateway into crypto. Once people get familiar with it, they eventually discover new possibilities, like cheap transactions, smart contracts etc.
Bashing BTC or playing cheap marketing tricks in order to pump BCH is so obvious that any investor worth their salt can smell from miles away, and will receive it with skepticism.

It is much better to focus on the positives."
Rude as your post may be, your assessment is also complete nonsense.
"And this is all on purpose. They've stated many times, they want Bitcoin to become a settlement layer.

It doesn't matter to them if the fees are $100."

"You're right, I should rephrase it to ""there are many early adopters here"". My data point would be the number of developers who have moved to bitcoin cash. All the different implementations that used to support Bitcoin segwit are now working on Bitcoin Cash. Don't forget the miners and entrepreneurs who have shown support for Bitcoin Cash too. Those guys are even earlier adopters.

But again you're right, there's no definitive statistic to prove this statement. "
If I thought BTC could thrive, I would be calling BCH a shitcoin. Unfortunately, I think of BCH as a lifeboat sailing away from the Titanic.
Then don't trust them. Fact check. Nobody here is deliberately trying to mislead you. All the stuff posted here are EASILY verifiable with a quick Google search. You're an adult I assume, no need us to hold your hands right?
I have edited my comment to better reflect the point I was trying to make in light of your criticism. My point was that BTC took an approach that was working and broke it. In other words, they followed an evolutionary dead-end. If you look at the results of the scaling approaches that both chains have taken BTC is nothing but frustration and anger over fees and confirmation times, and BCH is a delight to transact with.
"And along comes a bch zombie.  

Not interested in hearing more propergander about who started what. "
Rude and unnecessary. There's a legitimate grievance here whether you personally recognise it or not. 
"The r/btc subreddit was created as a place where people could escape the r / bitcoin censorship, and freely criticize Bitcoin BTC.  

This was many years ago, before Bitcoin Cash even existed.

If you just want to post pro-BCH stuff, then r/bitcoincash is probably the more appropriate subreddit.

- r/bitcoin = Only pro-Bitcoin BTC posts allowed. Massive censorship & bannings.

- r/btc = freely discuss the differences between BTC & BCH

- r/bitcoincash = focused discussion about Bitcoin Cash.

I mean, it would be highly unusual to have a r/**btc** subreddit, where we weren't supposed to talk about **BTC**."
No, I don't need my hand held. But it's not about me. It's everyone else. I want the newcomers to have their hand held and a community to answer their dumb questions that they could just Google. Because at the end of the day my investment won't increase if the money invested doesn't increase.
"I do recognise that people have a difference of opinion. In my opinion the war will inevitably end with BCH taking the market away from BTC because it was created to address the problems that were deliberately introduced into BTC by bad actors. That doesn't mean that I'm compelled to forgive or excuse their actions; that would mean that anyone would be free to do whatever they please secure in the foreknowledge of my forgiveness."
Crypto has *always* looked kooky lmao. Only crazy people would want to change the financial system we have today. The sheeps are ok with using fiat.
I want you to imagine this, for every post of adoption you see, there's a few more that never post and get turned away from the fanatics on this sub. Just imagine that
I‚Äôm just asking for specific names. Gavin wrote one blog post. 
Please finish reading my sentences before responding to them. 
"You are forgiven; you are wrong, but it's okay to be wrong, so long as you're willing to learn.

Bitcoin Core was the original Bitcoin node client, designed by Satoshi to be the reference client. In other words, Satoshi intended it to be the standard Bitcoin client that all other clients were to be compared to. In mid-2010, Satoshi had handed control of the git repository over to Gavin Andresen. Gavin stepped down as lead developer in April 2014, and Core has been lead by Wladimir J. van der Laan ever since.

In short, Bitcoin Core was developed by Satoshi himself, who deliberately made it *the* Bitcoin, rather than *a* Bitcoin, specifically to settle this sort of naming dispute."
"Enjoy your ""safety"" behind the fence of your cult. Gee golly, you almost had an original thought there."
Too much irony here nimblecoin xD
They'll even ask you how the country is supposed to survive without the government taking wealth from the people and giving it to rich people via inflation.
"I'm guessing you're talking about the same Satoshi who wrote the whitepaper? Which has a definition for what bitcoin is? The definition that BTC no longer qualifies under? Since the definition involves a chain of signatures that BTC with segwit no longer requires?

BTW, the client was originally just called Bitcoin, not Bitcoin Core. The name changed repeatedly, was called bitcoin and Bitcoin QT before Core, then finally called Bitcoin Core.

Referencing the client but not the white paper? Do you consider the white paper deprecated? If not then you've got some problems with your argument.

Just asking a few questions and making some statements since cherry picking data is a common problem with people trying to justify incorrect statements."
Respecting someone's opinion is usually not done by calling them a zombie. A zombie implies the person is brainless and therefore unable to form their own opinion where as /u/nolo_me was clearly expressing their opinion and why. 
Not if you happen to like zombies. 
"Actually, when you're quoting a misspelling, you're supposed to use ""[sic]""."
"Fair enough, In that case I recommend saying: 
> And along comes a bch zombie. Which I think is totally awesome."
"Yeah, well my opinion is that you are wrong and that it was a failed hijack. 

See, this is progressive isn't it? 

Let's just agree to have our own opinions and leave it here. I'll respect yours and you respect mine. "
That's the funny thing though. Most people here are early adopters (who got banned from rBitcoin) and don't really care about the price anymore. If anything, BCH holders are the LEAST price sensitive holders in cryptos. The price can tank 10x (because we're already up 100x anyways) and we'll still be here pushing for adoption. We don't really give a shit about pumps. (Compare the front page during a BCH pump vs rbitcoin front page during a BTC pump: vastly different) r/BTC barely mentions price if ever.
"They continued for quite a while after the buyout. I couldn't say for how long now but it was a long time by my recollection.

I believe it was mostly the developers that were hired away. I don't think the company was purchased."
Forgive me if I am wrong. But wasn't it first there was the project bitcoin. Then there were several teams working on the project bitcoin, one of which was the core team with several other teams also working on the bitcoin project from different angles. Then the bitcoin core team decided that any reference to ideas made by non approved teams were heretics and should be cast out of project bitcoin?
"kinda like Ver and Mt. Gox? 

er, uh"
Can you name specific devs who you think are early adopters who switched over to BCH? I can‚Äôt name one. Devs like Gavin, Jeff and Hearn are doing their own things and every other longtime Bitcoin developer contributes to Core as far as I know.
"Bitcoin Core was first. They are the reference implementation. They had claim to the Bitcoin name before any fork. 

Bitcoin Cash introduced the new code that implemented the hard fork. They were the ones who split off. Regardless of which coin the market ends up favoring, Bitcoin Cash is *not* Bitcoin. No more than the Iceweasel browser is Navigator. It is, in fact, a fork."
"an irrational market?

the power of branding?

what percentage of new users (old btc holders do not count) would you estimate have been in crypto for less than a year, and have yet to understand the protocol or why it was even created?

what percentage of these newbies are just downloading coinbase, linking their credit cards, and buying BTC thinking they'll get rich (not even using it for anything)?

and the people who ARE moving btc are largely traders who have been in crypto or made enough successful trades that to THEM $20~ fees are insignificant.

"
Depends on what the details of their contract was. It may have specifically barred them from continuing.
"The word you are looking for is ""father"", not ""farther"". ""Farther"" is a relative distance, whereas ""father"" is... well, just a relative."
"I think both irrational market and power of branding amounts to ""information"" distribution, and in the case of currencies, the information is largely dominated by the network effect.

At the moment, the largest use case for bitcoin is for trading crypto, and bitcoin is the most connected (most exchanges, trading pairs, futures, etc) with orders of magnitude more volume.

So yeah, the larger fees are considered insignificant because people are not getting into bitcoin to find a better way to pay for coffee.

In the real world, credit cards are already pretty good for buying coffee."
The evidence of Core's competence is that the BCH teams do little besides copy paste whatever they write. It's pretty laughable actually. 
This. I think the whole store of value argument is mostly held by people who are relatively new and saw bitcoin price skyrocket and want to moon forever vs those of us who were really excited about not having to pay paypal fees anymore. Very different perspectives on what is important and what are the goals. 
You maybe right on that?  All I know is that the crazy arse FUD on both sides doesn't help anyone. It only makes crypto look kooky. 
"Why do you think we have so many positive adoption posts on here?

Because people using it (and being able to use it) is what matters to your investment.

Refer newcomers with ""dumb questions"" to the right sub. No mainline sub can catch every single newbie post. This is also not a support forum for every software or hardware application around BTC / BCH. Those are always served by specialized channels where experts are around."
Gavin is still here with us and still contributing to Bitcoin Cash on a research capacity. Most of the implementations of Bitcoin (ABC, XT, Unlimited, etc) have early adopters. I'm not talking Satoshi early. Maybe 2011-ish and earlier.
"> Bitcoin Cash introduced the new code

Nope. Bitcoin Core introduced a lot of new bad code. Bitcoin Cash is closer approximation of the whitepaper"
"> Bitcoin Cash introduced the new code that implemented the hard fork.

That's not how it works, I suggest you read up on how hard forks work.

Anyways, core were the ones who split off from any regular basis for bitcoin."
"Fine, please recognise that other people have a different opinion. If you refuse to accept other opinions then why should we listen to yours?

In any case, this discussion was about possibly ending this stupid war. Why show up throwing grenades? "
Wasn't changetip bought out by some company and all the team members moved there?
"It's not about the points being factual, they come off as defensive. Just like someone that always says ""trust me"", I have a hard time trusting them."
The way I see it, the more people use bitcoin, the more they will WANT to use bitcoin cash. Since bitcoin has more marketability, we should support it to help people get INTO crypto while praising BCH as an efficient evolution of the technology. Bashing BTC, which has made some people very very rich, makes people not even want to get into the crypto market. They aren‚Äôt hearing your positives about BCH - they‚Äôre just seeing a war where both coins have sputtered and appear to be losing inertia.
Thanks! I‚Äôll look into it more. 
Right or wrong, I'm listening to the side with the better signal-to-noise ratio.
I have both so, like, I want both to get saf.
"Did your father also tell you that it's unprofessional to talk about corruption and scams?

Do you think bitcoin core is being ""nice"" to bitcoin cash?

When youre in the schoolyard and multiple people are calling the other side scammers(btc calling bch scammers) and you know very little about the subject would you listen to the guys making the accusations or the guy meekly defending himself?

Because that is what you want us to do. To be ""nice"". This also happen to be a specific technique intelligence operatives do to opposition groups. They infilitrate them and makes the case that everyone should be ""nice"". The air goes out of the balloon and something that at one point could pose a threat has been reduced to something completely harmless. Most of the people here from the beginning were here because they realized what core was about and/or they were banned from /r/bitcoin. I don't think we have any obligation to be ""nice"" to people like that. Everyone needs to keep a check on their emotions but is under no obligation to be nice. You shouldnt be nice to your enemy.

That said, obviously we should highlight the advantages of bch or else what are we defending?"
https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7q7dde/the_checkered_history_of_the_evolving_brandnames/
BlockstreamCoin is not Bitcoin. Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin. So nobody here is bashing Bitcoin.
Exactly. It comes across as desperation for not getting your way on what you view as ideal.
"> r/btc = freely discuss the differences between BTC & BCH

Agree. Bitcoin network split. U can't talk about Bitcoin and not mention both chains and news cyclce of both"
"You have to understand so many of us went through abuse from /r/bitcoin and now all over the internet we have to deal with the effect of their propaganda. Like seriouly good people are convinced I want to destroy this great new technology Bitcoin and they just don't know any better. They got convinced by people hearing from people hearing from people hearing from people being lied to by propaganda that an psychopath business guy and a evil chinese miner are trying to destroy bitcoin. It's driving me nuts when I go on a dutch forum about Bitcoin and I post a screenshot of me selling my hardware in bitcoin cash people get upset with me.  They say: ""Yeah well I am not against bitcoin cash but the people behind it what they have done is a disgrace. This one guy comes across like a psychopath and these miners tried to hijack bitcoin for themselves and it's all a cash grab. ""

It is so unfair! I don't like Roger Ver to much myself and I really don't like Wright (seen him conman with my own eyes) but compared to the propaganda and  the DDOS and the sockpuppetry and the bullying from core I think that Roger and Jian are like ... wel not that bad in comparison. 

A lof of us here are like when you go through an abusive relationship. Even after you have found a safe new place you might still be obsessed with her/him before you can let go. "

New guy here into the crypto world, may you point me towards any resource to learn about this? "
">  I think it's important that we highlight the pitfalls of Core 

Don't need to. Tell then that Bitcoin is great and that everybody should use it and people will come back: but it sucks, I bought 200 dollars worth of Bitcoin and lost 20 when I transfered it and I had no idea how long I had to wait. 

Right now we don't have to do much. /r/bitcoin is still in denial but the state of the network is real. 

When people complain about Bitcoin kind of being really sucky right now just tell them to update to the August 2017 fix. "
"BTC supporter, here, who still thinks BTC can work. As mentioned in a comment above, BCH provides a simple solution to a complex problem. This, to me, signals one of three situations:

* The BCH team are geniuses who have discovered and implemented an elegant solution
* The BCH team are morons who don't understand the problem, or
* The BCH team are scam artists trying to profit off convincing morons who don't understand the problem that they are geniuses who have discovered and implemented an elegant solution.

Unfortunately, based on my own observations, the most favorable of those options does not seem, to me, to be the most likely.

*However,* I'm more than willing to extend the benefit of doubt toward BCH, the team, and supporters. My experiences are subjective and biased. I could be wrong. It's very possible that there's some brilliance to BCH that I'm missing, perhaps buried under the horrendous signal-to-noise ratio.

In any case, I do wish BCH supporters well. I just feel safer on my side of the fence."
But you do see the problem with such a level of fragmentation, right?
">  I don't think we need to stop getting out the word that BTC doesn't work

">Let's try and promote to positives of BCH rather than the negatives of BTC.

This main issue is that by-and-large, these are the same thing."
"> My farther always told me it is highly unprofessional to say bad things about your competition. 

Your father was a wise man, that's very good advice and a maxim I always follow when I'm practising my profession. The thing is though (despite being accused of shilling by Core trolls all the way up to BashCo) I'm not being paid for my time here, so I'm free to say whatever the fuck I want and that's a freedom I like to exercise when I can.

BTC is not the Bitcoin described in the white paper, it's not the Bitcoin I signed up for and evangelized in the first place. BCH is. The reasons for BCH existing at all are all failures of BTC, you can't discuss one without the other because one was created to fix problems that were deliberately introduced into the other."
Debating is healthy 
"I usually talk about bitcoin among my friends and I give as an example the use of bitcoin cash, I recently taught a group of 10 people to use cryptocurrencies, and what I had was bitcoin cash I gave them a little bit to each one but I was left without nothing.
"
[deleted]
I 100% agree. If there's a lesson we shall learn from BTC is never to turn it into a religion. If there's a better way we should hardfork instead of blaming to whole world.
"Vince McMahon said this about his Monday Night Wars with WCW during the WWF Raw Series vs WCW Nitro! Series on Monday nights.

WCW would always bash WWF non-stop and slander them in every way.

Vince however, would never bash them or give them any attention, he just kept promoting the WWF. Eventually the WWF bought WCW and won the war.

Lesson there."
"Agreed; but, that would require a large number of individuals to grow up. "
"Totally agree. I have traded lots of crypto and love a lot of coins out there, but once I sold all my Bcash I never looked back because all their community does is talk trash. 

I would much rather support coins that have great tech and a strong community that understands there is space and use-cases for many currencies right now. It won‚Äôt always be like that, but right now I‚Äôd rather buy BGold, than Bcash ."
"Yeah this subreddit is absolutely trash when you want to find anything other than BTC bashing, they associated BTC with whoever they want to hate, but BTC doesnt belong to anyone.

the fact that Roger also helps and insist on making it a political fight on this same subreddit, doesn't help at all either.

just hate everywhere, this place sucks... politics just fuck up everything."
In case you haven't found out by now, BCH's only way of validating itself is by bashing Bitcoin. If you start to compare BCH to other alts, it falls woefully short.

Oh yeah, Core team are angels. Better stay there and escape these scary BCH developers who dared remove the arbitrary 1mb shackles."
You're very reasonable. For me, Bitcoin success is betting on the success of Lighting Network. In order for LN to be success, beside putting the money up to be spent, everybody requires to run a hub (or at least has someone to manage the money for them). This gonna be harder than requires everyone to run a SPV node. In the best case scenario, it could takes 2-3 years for LN to have enough hubs to see to good side of it. It's possibly too late at that time. And LN is open-source, everybody can copy it to their coins.
"Calling people in their own subreddit who you don't have to listen to ""rampant fanboys frothing at the mouth"" is worse than bashing, it's harassment and unfair abuse.

Explaining how bitcoin is broken and making perfectly factual and logical criticisms is nowhere fucking near bashing."
"From my experience getting into cryptos.  I bought btc and would look at r/bitcoin constantly trying to inform myself.  I then found r/btc and found myself confused and at a crossroad that a flippening was possible.   r/bitcoins censorship was a big concern of mine but after a few months I can see why they heavily censor their subreddit.   It would be constant posts bashing bch or how high fees are.  I‚Äôve now come to like they don‚Äôt allow it to get like that.   Which also is why I have to limit myself to reading r/btc because it‚Äôs constant bashing of btc.  Whether it‚Äôs the purpose of the post or it will turn into that in the comments of the thread.    I honestly think both will thrive and people should have interest in both so they don‚Äôt cloud their judgement of which one will win because they probably both will in different ways.  

Good luck to both dev teams in creating a better world.  "
"Even just calling BTC ""Bitcoin Legacy"". If BCH is the superior technology, so be it, but Bitcoin Core is still the reference implementation for Bitcoin, and thus, still Bitcoin. Calling BCH ""Bitcoin"", rather than ""Bitcoin Cash"", is patently false."
"> My thoughts are that both sides might support each other

Our side only exists because their side took something that we put years of work and evangelism into, declared that it couldn't possibly work when it was already working and deliberately broke it in order to prove themselves right. They censored anyone who disagreed with them and generally acted like massive cunts.

I'm sorry that we're not all sitting around a campfire singing Kum Ba Yah, but that's not something thieves and their victims generally do together. "
Because it used to be a BTC sub. The refugees who got banned from r/Bitcoin for the thoughtcrime of thinking BTC should have bigger blocks all formed a new community here or went to altcoins. [Read this](https://www.yours.org/content/the-bitcoin-scaling-wars---part-1---the-dark-ages-d71e23cffbe7/) to learn the history. 
"I am sorry that you saw hate, and I hope you recognize that we are not all like that, just as all BTC advocates are not like that, either.  I am a big advocate for niceness.  Probably further than a lot of people want to go; one of my heroes in life is Fred Rogers.

> My thoughts are that both sides might support each other.

I wish the best for every crypto holder and have nothing but goodwill for them.  I'm not sure I can go as far as supporting BTC because my honest conclusion is that I don't think the path it is taking is going to work out."

The network advantage of 30$ transaction fees at peak times? How is that a sustainable currency system?
"BTC is shedding its network advantage. The network advantage is built and sustained by it being a transactable currency. You can't afford to use it like that for anything but large value transactions now. You build a community for a currency by showing how useful and cool it can be. BTC users used to transfer small amounts of cash such as $1 worth of BTC to their friends to get them interested in using the technology. Now BTC users are priced right out of that and BCH users are not. That's why BCH is better positioned to form a network. 

/u/tippr $0.5"
The network advantage of BTC comes from us: the early adopters who evangelized for Bitcoin, a peer to peer digital currency. Our work has been co-opted by those who took over the project and used the name to refer to something that's not a peer to peer digital currency, and we're quite rightly a bit fucked off about it.
">But it should be said that one of the best narratives for why BCH is a good and secure blockchain is that BCH's model is how Bitcoin has worked for most of its existence

I couldn‚Äôt disagree more. Apply that logic to most technological developments in human history and we would‚Äôve been left with the original model without any evolution, resulting in a quick death. Survival is about adapting."
That sub has been mercilessly invaded by trolls daily. Its far more obvious there since there's fewer posts in general. It's so hard to fight back. We need to crosspost our discussion posts here over there more often to flood out the trolls.
arguably a much better named sub 
And what's wrong with being obsessed with the failure of a co opted project with immense potential to help humanity?
"In many ways, it doesn't matter what happens on r\/btc. Either you believe that a 1MB block size limit is ultimately destructive to the viability of a currency (especially at this point in time) and an attempt should be made to work around that or you don't.

If you're basing your crypto decisions on the (perceived) quality of posts on a reddit forum, you're probably going to make poor decisions."
"> all I saw were people bashing Bitcoin

Then you are blind or lying.   Which is it?   You know full well people here love Bitcoin and prove it by being upset that the developers have screwed its usefulness.   You either have to be retarded or completely dishonest to pretend you don't know the difference between that, and ""bashing Bitcoin"".   They aren't remotely the same."
">When I got into Bitcoin, I also looked into BCH but all I saw were people bashing Bitcoin, the community felt angry and hateful, almost fearful that if they didn't bash Bitcoin enough BCH will fail. Doesn't look good to new investors. Just look at the front 2 pages of r/btc, 95% of the posts are bashing Bitcoin.

It goes both ways. I see at least as many people polemically talking about ""BCash"" and how it's a scam run by Roger Ver and Jihan Wu as I see people bashing Core and Blockstream. Both subs are constantly bashing each other. 

But it should be said that one of the best narratives for why BCH is a good blockchain is that BCH's model for how the blockchain should work has been tried and tested for 7 years and has worked great. BTC's radically divergent model with full blocks, slow fees and high transaction times as a feature by contrast has worked absolutely abysmally and has led to a terrible useer-experience. I think if you were a company that makes roads, and your main competition considered it a point of pride that they designed and built 1 lane highways to be used in some of the most highly trafficked parts of the country, it's just a missed opportunity not to point out that unlike them you make highways with enough lanes to prevent congestion.

>Then I really researched BCH and the Coinbase fiasco, the constant manipulation and deceptive tactics used by BCH to confuse new users, wanting to change the name of BCH to Bitcoin, etc. This isn't a good marketing tactic in any business.

I cannot for the life of me imagine how the ""BCH and Coinbase fiasco"" is a black mark on BCH. What's the narrative there? BCH got added to Coinbase, people who worked at Coinbase probably knew in advance and expected the price to pump so they bought it up, therefore the technology and people behind BCH are bad? That sounds like a complete non-sequitur to me."
"> marketing tactic

Bitcoin is not a company. U've a wrong mindset, my dude"
It's not mindless bashing though. Most of the anti-Bitcoin Segwit posts are just pointing out OBJECTIVE flaws with the old protocol. You can disagree, but post objective factual counterpoints, if that's even possible lol. Most of the people here are early adopters who got banned from rbitcoin for questioning the authorities.
"> Doesn't look good to new investors.

This is key. Many of us do not think of bitcoin as an investment first with its utility being a side effect. Many of us came to bitcoin because of its utility thinking its increase in value would be a happy side effect. Obviously investor money has come in faster than merchant adoption and that has hampered its utility and its value. Long ago when I discovered reddit and the bitcoin sub I read all the talk about the evil chinese miners trying to corner the market and I worried about 51% attacks and all the other FUD that I read there. But then suddenly Gavin and Mike were pushed out.. the people most responsible for bitcoins success IMO and that gave me great pause. But it was ok because core was just one team and having multiple teams and clients was what bitcoin was all about. But then the sub started to talk about how other clients were evil and other teams were trying to destroy bitcoin and I was very confused. I made a post in the bitcoin sub asking some honest questions about bitcoin XT and it was deleted. You are only allowed to talk about the core team (and approved) work. That was not the bitcoin I signed up. Only then like many refugees did I find r/btc. People here are more bashing the core team than they are bashing bitcoin itself. That is the whole crux of this situation. We LOVE bitcoin. We love it for so many different reasons than moon lambos (not implying that is all you care about). We fell in love with the promise of a world changing financial system free of banks and governments and paypal fees. We saw a small group of people take that dream and strangle it and a lot of us do not understand how such a thing could happen. 

I can not stress enough that I think you should change your perspective of ""r/btc is bashing bitcoin"" to ""r/btc is distraught over the changes and direction the core team has taken bitcoin"".  This is so much bigger than marketing. Bitcoin was supposed to be cheap fast and peer to peer. Soon it will be none of those."
"Why did you falsely claim that they are ""Bitcoin"" bashing posts?   They aren't.   They are posts bashing a subreddit that happens to be named after Bitcoin.   And they are about the technical limitations that the Bitcoin developers have left in place.  Slightly huge difference.   Stop promoting the bullshit narrative that this sub is anti-Bitcoin.  "
You are right. That would clear up any misunderstanding. Thank you.... 
BCH is about escaping the suicide pact that Core (and Theymos) negotiated amongst themselves.

It's BCC on some exchanges. Doesn't really matter, nobody ever really refers to Bitconnect when saying BCC anyway.

Wait what, I was expecting you to write BTC/Core/Blockstream, lmao. Legit surprised me. You have it the wrong way around and I'm wondering where you're getting these upvotes.

The only thing remotely true is what you say about us 'wanting to change the name of BCH to Bitcoin', yes, that's because we want it to change to just 'Bitcoin' rather than 'Bitcoin cash' once the market has (hopefully) decided on BCH being the true bitcoin.

Edit: interesting how I'm getting downvoted, HMMM.."
"If Reddit is anything to go by there are more than a few US citizens laboring under the misconception that coin-to-coin trading qualifies as like-kind (it definitely does not under the new tax code and almost certainly did not before).

Unfeasible? Proof? Bitcoin Unlimited actually did tests and proved otherwise. Where are your studies/research/proof?
LOL, you can repeat Core propaganda points well, but you cannot argue WHY. It is already proven long ago that they are incorrect. I will not indulge you.
The real delusion is that we're arguing over fake internet money. This fake internet money is more valuable than the fake paper money.

Yeah the amount of vitriol I see towards people who talk about bitcoin cash in all of the crypto subs is bizarre.
Meh I bought some of my BCH at 3100+ and I will ride it all down to zero before I sell. I can't be the only one.
Man, that sucks. 
The network is congested, so fees are high and done transactions do not confirm our even show up.

Honest question (new here), why is it so painful to use ETH?

CryptoKitties is only ONE APP. What happens when ETH goes mainstream ? (And no, it's not mainstream).
That, if you can get past the verification process... I'm not from USA and with my passport to buy in coinbase was easy, but there's no way to get my ID or driver license past the validation. So I'm stuck with coinbase and can't send to my wallet without paying a 12‚Ç¨~ fee.
I‚Äôm not attacking it but the backlash is astounding. 
But coinbase requires only 1 verified document to buy, whereas gdax needs 2 to transfer coins from coinbase without fee. That's the trouble.
Username checks out.
If you are verified on coinbase , you are verified on gdax. They are the same company. 
"Blocks which are orders of magnitude larger may have a major impact to decentralization. Blocks which keep pace with Moore's law, not so much.

Normal people watch HD Netflix at home, at a bandwidth of 500 megs every 10 minutes.
A 3TB hard drive can be purchased for $100.

An 8MB block is *still tiny* when you compare to readily available technology. A 1MB block is laughably small.

You're worrying too much about block size. It is *so* far from being a technical limitation, it isn't even worth debating at this scale.

Then what's a paid shill? A redundancy? I always thought shilling just meant aggressively selling your product/idea, regardless of being paid or not. You just have a strong incentive to do it because you might stand to gain a lot from it (e.g. being a holder of a cryptoasset OR even being paid)
Convert BTC to USD. Convert USD to BCH.
They can just add a BTC-BCH pair as well as the BCH-BTC pair.
"When you place a Limit order, you're specifying a trade price you want someone to meet. If you specify a price that could be met by an order that's already on the books, your order will take that order and you will pay a taker fee on that trade - *unless you keep the check box* in which case your order won't be placed at all.

shilling for the biggest and most well known coin... good one im laughing
Nothing new. Has been happening on hundreds of other exchanges for months. 
It least now we have been told about it ahead of time
can confirm, just returned from salt fields
I hope it has decent volume and liquidity. Trading BCH USD on gdax is pretty shit.
"The ratio has already only been bulling up along with Etheruem while the space abandons BTC wholesale.

This is only going to throw gas on that fire. "
Wow, they actually announced it this time?
As a canadian i havent been abble to sell any coins through coinbase. I can now just trade my btc for bch? Or is it an american thing only?
Is that even a big deal at this point?
"I am not a trader.

Does the pairing recognize it as a significant coin or is it convenience?"
What are pairs in this context
Can‚Äôt wait to get rid of my BTCrash yay!!
I'm betting this will relieve more tx demand on BTC than segwit would
What's the difference between limit only and post only??
"I only hold bch now, but I was into writing bots for a while and I liked having crypto pairs instead of Fiat pairs. I'll give my perspective on why this trading pair is significant.

Various coins tend to stay within certain ratios with one another. For instance, if ltc was averaging .01 with BTC, then it was good to buy ltc with btc when the ratio got down to something like .006. Once the ratio moves the other direction to something like .02 it was a good time to trade back, buying BTC with ltc. After every trade back to BTC you are holding more BTC than before. 

If instead I had traded for dollars, both BTC and ltc could go up in price together, which they often did, and I would have lost money by sitting on the sidelines.

I have stopped trading after bch came out. Imagine missing the jump from $300 to $2500 because you traded for ltc or btc. I won't risk that type of loss.

But tons of bots still trade like that, so I see the bch/btc pair as significant even though I personally would not trade on it."
Wrong, network is at capacity. Coinbase really shouldn't have to change anything, besides batching transactions is retarded, increases delay, risk..
Coinbase EU? do you have a source for this or is it a rumor? 
Are you implying that you can't shill for a big and well known coin? Why not?

"Market orders incur fees.


I think you mean Limit Order.  Those are free."
They can. It‚Äôs called LTC
"Yea.. but now you'll have a chart showing you which way the price momentum is actually going.

Currently you have to do mental arithmetic, which is a prime location to inject bias into your decision making."
Thank you
I was joking, but they're not really quite the same either. Only a few select coins get to be the ones traded against on most exchanges, at the moment typically btc and eth. If bch was selected for this too, it would be because it was considered to be on a par with those two, which would be especially relevant on Coinbase when it adds more coins later in the year.
">~~BCH goes up. Core goes down where it belongs.~~

Everything goes down. Nothing goes up as market confidence is crushed and takes years to rebuild. Could start with BCH, maybe it doesn't. Point is we are in a great position to begin picking up the pieces when BTC implodes.
"
"> There are still too many people who have drank the core koolaid and think bitcoin cash is a scam.

Even sadder thing is that not only Core supporters but a lot of people in /r/CryptoCurrency thinks the same way, and you'd assume they would be somewhat more open-minded and unbiased towards the differences of BTC/BCH"
[deleted]
My Spidey senses are tingling. If true does anyone else see this event causing a possibly significant rise in price for bcash?
What you mean by not being able to move their BTC? It's literally free of charge to send and receive BTC on GDAX/Coinbase. No withdraw/network fees.
"The only real reason to move BTC is to trade for alt coins, of which there are almost no BCH / alt coin pairs. 

This is because we are all honestly here to trade crypto and make money, not use it as currency. Otherwise nobody would care about the prices. "

its most intellectuals true feelings at the deepest level if but if we take a ""let market decide"" position immediately and rise above the drama then core is going to look nuts, fast."
Replied to the wrong guy mate
"Those are the same thing. Swapping the order of a pair just means swapping the word ""Buy"" for ""Sell."" You'll note there isn't, say, a USD/ETH pair. There's *alread* an ETH/USD pair. What's the point?"
OK man i did already know that, but somehow i wasnt linking it to the difference between post only and limit only
What would you describe their behavior as then? if not shilling? 
I don't care if they're bitter, I'd rather they be salty

My entire point here is to object to what you just did there.

You have a narrative, and because I said something which contradicts that narrative, you take it as an indication that I‚Äôm your adversary. It‚Äôs fundamentally intolerant.

These petty rivalries help nothing."
if every coinbase withdrawal used the same address for (coinbase's) change, they wouldn't need to do a consolidation transaction to collate all the different change utxo's.
The fees are too costly for tipping though.
"An horde of ""you're attacking Bitcoin"" sockpuppets that would harass me in real life."
Yes, please, create petition. Also mention that coinbase sell store of value for unreasonable low price. The must sell each coin for 1.000.000$ not less. If the will drop support it will solve all issues.
"Firstly, your ""way more"" here measures quantity, but not quality: there's a giant difference between 1 refactoring commit and 1 commit that completely changes how Bitcoin works (for example SegWits'), only the second one shapes Bitcoin's governance.

Secondly, your ""objective data"" it's straight up misleading; Chaincode was made from ex Blockstream devs and what you label as ""MIT"" it's actually made of only 3 people all non-academics: 1 person is former Bitcoin lead developer (role entrusted by Satoshi Nakamoto himself) and was kicked out by Blockstream for the cardinal sin of opposing small blocks, 1 person is Wladimir known for being perfectly aligned with every Blockstream's decision, last person is Cory Fields who mostly does refactoring and code optimizations without being involved in Bitcoin politics. The university only funds development and doesn't have any actual researcher involved in active development.

Thirdly, it doesn't matter how many different people contribute if there's a single entity that can freely choose those individuals. Blockstream kicked out of Core every single developer not agreeing with them, there's no debate, no alternative solutions; all decisions are made in Blockstream company, then astroturfed and forced on others: that's centralized (and the worst kind of centralized I add: totalitarianism) development. For comparison, the so called ""centralized, 83% in the hand of one person"" BCH, when posed with the problem of finding a new DAA, had 3 different solutions (implemented indipendently by 3 different groups) that were all indipendently tested and the applied solution was chosen based on actual data on performance, not on developer's biased opinions: **this** is how you do decentralized development."
"That's what we did. It's called Bitcoin Cash. 

The centralized group still exists, though, and you are free to use their coin. "
">No reward for doing so? Not if you can send all the costs to your users - then it's just bad customer service. Coinbase has been known for its high transaction fees all along.

Coinbase literally has free transaction fees for all currencies it supports if you take the extra step to transfer from Coinbase to GDAX (which is also free)."
"Fine, thousands of people are banned and censored at /r/bitcoin but you found one thread that wasn't censored, as far as you can tell, and that counts for a lot.

"That depends on why they're doing the transaction. They might be moving to a cold wallet, for example.

If they don't need to do the consolidation for many transactions to one address, they don't really need to do it for many transactions to many addresses.

On reason to do consolidation transactions might be to guard against rising fees. Though it's hard to believe they can get much higher."
"Someone should tell r/Bitcoin about a great feature that Bitcoin Cash has, it's called Integrated Witness. Some of the perks:

* Validation of the witness data is integrated with the normal block validation, so the security model is better. Moreover, said security model has underwent 9 years of rigorous testing.
* No possibility of unupgraded miners stealing your segwit funds
* Does not require millions of dollars and countless hours in dev time from the entire ecosystem of private companies to support because they all already support it
* Was invented by the creator of Bitcoin himself Satoshi Nakomoto, and not the current crop of bumbling, incompetent, possibly malicious Core devs who have broken BTC."
