i know this is late, but fyi dogecoin is a fork of luckycoin  which has a funky mining algorithm not comparable to bitcoin. i’d say litecoin is a much better comparison here.
But if you looked. What would you find?

"> When you prevent people from challenging consensus, you lose the democratic nature of the system.

This part literally never happened. Mods have stated hundreds (thousands?) of times that advocating for proposals has always been permitted. This was even true back in the BitcoinXT days when a lot of people got duped into thinking BIP101 was actually a good idea. There was weeks or even months worth of discussion about BIP101, but it ultimately failed to gain anything resembling consensus. BIP101 would have failed regardless of /r/Bitcoin's policy to prohibit promoting clients which were coded to cause a contentious hard fork. 

I think you overestimate the 'democratic nature of the system'. Aside from the fact that Bitcoin isn't a democracy, neither is reddit. Reddit is extremely vulnerable to Sybil attacks as you alluded to previously. Even without moderators, there wouldn't be what you would consider 'free and open discussion' due to rampant manipulation. I maintain that manipulation on reddit has been so insanely high that strict moderation has been necessary to facilitate the free and open discussion that you seek. 

More directly to your point though... /r/Bitcoin is a subreddit about **Bitcoin**. It's not a subreddit about /r/Bitcoin. 

>However, there are serious concerns with the neutrality of moderation on /r/bitcoin which seem targeted at ideas that go 'against the flow'. 

Frankly I think the matter was closed when these guys decided to abandon consensus entirely and create the Bcash altcoin. That token is barely limping along, mainly only because of fraudulent marketing. I really don't see how one can argue that /r/Bitcoin ought to allow attacks on Bitcoin to be carried out by malicious altcoiners. The advocates in this subreddit will continue to weave fabrications (some of which you have repeated) and spew vitriol, and /r/Bitcoin will continue to defend itself as best as it is able. The matter is settled, and Bitcoin is moving forward. "
">manipulators from subverting consensus and damaging Bitcoin's security and network effect

You mean exactly like what you and the other moderators of /r/bitcoin have done?"
">Given that Bitcoin is a distributed consensus network, I don't think that discouraging manipulators from subverting consensus and damaging Bitcoin's security and network effects qualifies as a 'political agenda'.      

In a distributed concensus system, users must be able to challenge concensus. When you prevent people from challenging consensus, you lose the democratic nature of the system. This may be a side-effect, or the intended effect, but it is certainly effecting /r/bitcoin. Here is what one author says about ""subverting concensus"" in his book, ""Multiversities, ideas and democracy""

>Accusations of censorship are one of the marketing catch phrases that are used to trigger an emotional reaction from people who haven't been in the midst of these dishonest campaigns since they started a few years ago.      

  
I first bought Bitcoin in 2015 and have been reading /r/Bitcoin and bitcointalk since way before then. Many people who have been around /r/bitcoin for long enough do feel that the moderation policies have evolved aggressively into censorship and can give examples of where they see it happening, I really don't feel that it's just a smear attack.       


In some cases you seem to agree. Your own words regarding [BXT]:  
>More accurately, I support consensus. Attempts to moderate BitcoinXT topics based on the lack of consensus has regrettably escalated to censorship.          

.     



>You really should read this: http://lesswrong.com/lw/c1/wellkept_gardens_die_by_pacifism/   

I read the article you linked to, thankyou. It was a good read. I do understand the argument for strict moderation lest the quality of conversation drops, and I can see how /r/bitcoin is possibly the most targeted sub-reddit or even forum anywhere online for those with an agenda, and you guys have a hard job in front of you protecting it. *However*, there are serious concerns with the neutrality of moderation on /r/bitcoin which seem targeted at ideas that go 'against the flow'. Those concerns are lowering the standard of conversation as people choose to raise their ideas/criticisms/questions elsewhere rather than be met with bans, deleted comments, suspensions, and ultimately being silenced. That should be of great concern too, if the moderation policies in place are truely about maintaining quality discussion.    
 As I originally said in the /r/bitcoin thread which this thread is referencing, the one which was removed by /r/bitcoin moderators, allowing at least one corner of the sub-reddit (a sticky thread) to stay a censorship-free place would go a long way to showing good faith in the community. But, as we can see, that suggestion was silenced, and here we are having this discussion on /r/btc instead

"Definitely not, I was always polite and respectful, you manipulative piece of trash.

Lifeban for stepping out of the circlerjerk after a year of activity. Didn't even bother giving a reason."
Even if every single one of the lies that you and your shills have spread were actually true, it would still be better than being an outright scammer. 
It probably didn't have anything to do with your charming personality.

"You will never find the right answer to that question. 

Because Core devs are like politician and mods are like law enforcer. Do you ask if a cop is a policy maker?"
">just so they can complain about how they got removed    

I bet. But that's not what I was doing. I do think a censorship free thread would be a good idea. Or at the very least, a discussion on the /r/bitcoin sub-reddit on the topic of censorship would be good. So I wasnt *just* doing it to be able to feign outrage, I geuninely wanted the thread posted. In fact I dont want to feign outrage at all, I am outraged by it. The censorship there is maddening and counter-productive."
The fact that posts like that are deleted tells you everything you need to know abt core developers and their motives.  The core developers are not an asset.  It's an illusion.
"I think you're falling into the same trap that most of this subreddit does, which to confuse moderation and censorship. If you want a ""censorship-free"" sub, then I don't know why you're posting here. Sure, the mods like to claim that the sub isn't moderated, but that's just another lie they tell to push their agenda. There have been many instances where this subreddit accuses /r/Bitcoin of 'censorship' and then turns around and does the same exact thing. "
"> Go fuck yourself, I've always been civil and fair in your sub.

The irony!!!"
Yeah, it's pretty common for people to post things they know will be removed, just so they can complain about how they got removed. Then they get to pretend to have a knee-jerk reaction about it. Very predictable.

"It's a horrible trap people fall into when they confuse 'censorship' with 'moderation'. It's almost as bad as when they confuse 'theft' with 'stealing', or when they confuse 'murder' with 'unlawful intentional killing'. Somebody really has to stop this epidemic of confusion of totally different words and concepts that is going around. Just the other day I saw somebody attempt to claim that 'racism' is the same as 'believing another race is intrinsically inferior to one's own', which any properly aducated person today will tell you, is a completely wrong and misleading definition.

When will people stop falling into the trap of attempting to draw connections between words which do not even share that many letter? Heck, 'censorship' and 'moderation' share no more than five letters of the alphabet, out of ten each. That's only a 50% similarity at best. Case closed!"
Hardly any irony. I only lost respect in that sub and your person after the ban. I stand by my point: go fuck yourself.
Sure, I'd def support open mod logs and all that. As I said, I don't like the censorship. All I said was that there is merit to what the link says. And there is. Whether r/bitcoin has implemented it appropriately is another matter
Wow, such empty lmao.
So much for 'unregulated' currency.
"How many of the Moderators of r/bitcoin are actual Bitcoin Core developers?

Btw, same question goes to r/btc"
">confusing moderation and censorship  


I'm not sure that I am. When moderation is done in a way as to push a political agenda, then it is censorship. Moderation is to promote constructive conversation. Censorship is to make sure people only say what you want them to say.    
What I see happening here on/r/btc is less censorship tactics and more manipulative ""psyops"" style operations. Bots and shills, PR groups and disinfo are favored over censorship. Sure that sucks too, but I criticise both believe me :D"
"I have done many transactions that involve numerous outputs (>2), so thanks, but I do get how it works.

If the number of outputs drop to more than half (which they have), we can safely say that the number of Bitcoin transactions has dropped significantly even *with batched transactions*"
I am not sure I buy your last reasoning, but let's say I do. The transaction adoption on BTC is virtually flat at best then. I think this is a sad state, considering the last half of 2016 and first half of 2017 saw a healthy increase - at least until blocks began to be full.
As it should be. Sweet
"I can live with that.

Find the bastards that obviously commit fraud, and give them the maximum sentences, no matter what it costs to prosecute them (likely billions of dollars to get the CEOs of the largest banks).

But most of banking is just financial services just like the exchanges and payment processors we deal with in the cryptocurrency world. The price fixing among credit cards in America is illegal (in my opinion), but offering payment processing services is no different from what bitpay does.

I'm not anti banker. I'm just anti crime, and the petty fines we charge banks for crime these days are absurdly low."
It will do if you vote the right fucking people in instead of corporate shills.

"> As a CS professor, I can say definitively that you're literally wronger than anything anyone has ever been wrong about before.

that is quite a bold statement from a professor. you would think that professors (certainly the ones i work with anyway) would be slightly more reserved with their grand statements. in fact i have very very rarely ever heard an academic state something as truth claiming as that. 

looking at your post history, you don't come across as someone with a professorship either, but let's not judge too much, because there are all sorts in this world. 

> A brute force algorithm is one that must search the entire problem space to find the optimal solution.

as i said, nodes do not need to search the entire problem space as they have information about whole network at any given time. nWe have been over this time and time again, as the routing seems to be a combination of BGP routing (which they call Gossip states) and version of Dijkstra's algorithm. 

Nodes do not have to build a picture of the network every time they attempt to find a rote - as they have one already - so they can immediately discount non navigable routes. 

> The best part about LN is the fact that the network is going to be constantly changing so there's a distinct possibility that even brute-force won't be enough, as the network may change faster than it takes to find the optimal route. That's fucking amazing.

no, it won't - everyone seems to think that changes are always going to happen in detriment to the route finding algorithm. 

in a real world scenario there the dynamism in the network with coalesce around an average. this average will balance neither in favour or detriment to any one search. i.e there is just as much chance that a re balance will work in ones favour, than not. 

edit: there is some more [info here](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/blob/master/07-routing-gossip.md) if you want to dive into the nuts and bolts.
