Scam coin lol
Fine. When stop using the btc reddit as bch reddit, I will stop calling you Roger, Roger. 
It’s Bitcoin cash you retard
Stop acting like a child where every one you disagree with is Roger Ver. This is so fucking stupid and useless !
Why the fuck are you trolling ??
It’s bcash fucking idiot.
When your shitcoin needs to pretend to be bitcoin, that’s when you know it’s bad
It’s all fun and games until you send bitcoin by accident and drop your worth in the hundreds or thousands.
Stop deleting my comments! The reddit is listed under btc/ and not bch. Last time I checked bitcoin cash was bch... am I wrong? That’s just deceiving don’t you think?
Btrash for a trashbeer...
Fuck you it’s Bitcoin Cash (BCH), you’re a piece of shit
Btrash isn't Bitcoin and it's not a beer either.
Bitcoin Cash? I thought this was a Bitcoin Reddit? Confused😝 cause its under BTC/. You guys should change it to BCH to avoid confusion.
I had to correct some colleagues on buying Bitcoin Cash. They were like yea I own Bitcoin... they showed me their wallet and it had Bitcoin Cash on it. I announced to the office that Bitcoin cash was NOT Bitcoin. Bitcoin is labeled BTC.. and doesn’t have ANY words after its name. They all let out a sigh and sold it for the real Bitcoin...🤗 They all promised to tell everyone not to buy the wrong one.... don’t want to get scammed. Oh and I reminded them that the reddit BTC isn’t a real Bitcoin thread. So deceiving, if Bitcoin was so legit why do they have to steal the Bitcoin name on everything? Reddit - btc and bitcoin . com. Damn con artist these days...
I’m not trolling i’m new to the Bitcoin thing but I was told Bitcoin Cash is not bitcoin just another alternative.  So i found the btc thread on Reddit and was just confused on why everyone called it bitcoin cash is all.. cause on Coinbase there is Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash why isn’t there just Bitcoin? So a friend just told me about how Bitcoin cash is a scam or something off of the real Bitcoin. Just weird to have people talking about Bitcoin Cash on a Reddit thread labeled /btc when bitcoin cash is actually labeled/bch. Come on man you can’t tell me that isn’t deceiving? 
You're not wrong, Walter, you're just an asshole.
You’re a moron
This is too fucking funny.
"How do know that is even a real name? Michael Marquardt has never shown up anywhere. There are no pictures of him. Nothing.  Nobody has ever interviewed him. There is no audio of him talking. Absolutely nothing. So Michael Marquardt might just be a pseudonym.

Fake name
"Theymos Theymos

Theymos, TS 55555"
Lol, theymos is rather a synonym for social engineering and censorship.
Has MM ever made a public appearance anywhere? 
"Ya he is. 

Too scared. To say who he really is. 


Says a lot about him and his integrity "
"""Someone said his name was Michael Marquardt"" and not being anonymous are two very different things. "
So?
The classic worthless distraction comment.

Keep him away from having any deciding power at all. which means dont listen to him dont follow him, and dont let him brainwash you. He can do what he wants with himself. 
"That's like saying we shouldn't send a thief to jail because we are all about freedom, and sending someone to jail would be contradictory.

I say let's keep the censors and masters of propaganda away. They believe in taking rights away from people and deceiving them. That doesn't fit well with an anti-censorship forum like r/btc. Don't forget one of those Core trolls managed to become a mod here (albeit for a short time), by deceiving Roger Ver."

I thought we decided that Cobra was luke-jr. Not that it matters who is behind that alias anyway. It's a bankster backed troll account no matter who is at the keyboard.
"> Also, his next tweet is that maybe BCH & BTC communities should come together. Where's the post on that? 

You're about 2 years too late. The people who are here tried to come together and you guys kicked us out of the club. I lived that personally.

Seems you have reached the bargaining phase too."
I support BTC getting a new POW. BCH not so much. 
">I think he has beef with Jihan Wu and the Chinese people in general

Having  beef with 1,38 billion people is very costly. Even Satoshi could not afford that. "
nevermind cobra actually told to go back to GPU or some other POW. so tecnical still POW but GPU mining is just stupid. he never sayd  POS

It's weird. It somehow feels like he's been agreeing with BCH since the beginning, but couldn't say so at first because he would have looked ridiculous.
"I have a few thoughts in response to this comment.

First, it contradicts itself. Let's censor this guy because he likes censorship? That just doesn't sit well with me.

Second, bch is permissionless by design (and that's a good thing). We couldn't keep him away if we wanted to (and if we tried he could just make a new account and we'd never know).

Third, admitting to your mistakes is one of the hardest things to do. He did that instead of just making a new account. Let's not cast him out for it.

Fourth, obviously he won't get a position of power any time soon. But again, if he wants one he can start from scratch with a new account and have the same chance as anyone else. Not because we want him to, but because we wouldn't know. "

OP deleted his comment, but he was blatantly asking for tips if anyone cares to know. It didn’t sound like he was joking either.
"Oh if you browse his tweets you will find, that list is not fabrication. I don't follow cobra but since he gets quoted over and over it is hard not to memorize.

I think he owns both and used BTC to increase BCH further, that's it. I'm not much interested in this gossip, I'd like to see bitcoin.org moving forward to unite both forks of bitcoin and both use-cases. We can only benefit."
"Have you checked the DNS record?

I doubt it."
You know that or you guess so?
"https://www.domainhistory.net/bitcoin.org#record_94156380

One thing for sure. You can't co-own a domain name without a legal entity to do that."
That was a bit of a leap. Their side has many instances of various people agreeing with and/or abetting luke-jr on various points, one more is far from conclusive (and verging into tinfoil hat territory).
I for one would love more info about that, have anything handy?
Can you link please?
"\> Occam's Razor

"He's been subpoenaed before as the administrator of bitcointalk, ostensibly to provide information about certain account's IP addresses and whatnot.

The name appears in the documents."
"Perhaps he doesn't. I personally have not verified his existence or had him prove to me he is Theymos.

My original point was to let the community know he has already been doxed and that this info is out there, to the best of my knowledge. If you had specified that your point was that MM is not really Theymos then I wouldn't have commented on your post. To say that Theymos is anonymous without stating that MM != Theymos doesn't tell the whole story.

I have no love for Theymos. I am simply trying to add info and move the discussion forward."
"He has a horde of fanatics and shills. Every single sentence that guy says about crypto is slandering BCH and shilling LTC. LTC trolls are everywhere in every tweet and in multiple subreddits.

Seriously, he is the most damaging person in crypto."

Oh my. 
All interesting but hardly proof
Just google *Theymos Subpoena*, there's a bunch of info.
OH SHIIEEET thanks, yes! changed.
WTF he didn't write that :D I wouldn't have tipped him :P. I know you were probably not serious still.. irony  can be a quite blurry thing in written form.

What about Christians?
what the frick. ill pass on that free internet moneys lol
Not me, it was the other one! 
I am not aware of one.
Oh yeah? What is your real name?
There is more evidence than that. 
So I'm not really worried with cobra at all, he is harmless, everybody has an eye on him, he can't hurt BCH ecosystem. Charlie, on the other hand...
"BTC=digital gold
BCH=payment

The brand comprises both. Much better than shilling litecon, which is a known scam and shitcoin. Making your own brand stronger seems much better than adopting the first piece of shit coin just to oppose BCH, the whole ordeal makes people flee and hurts BTC."
Eli5 why pow is so bad? 
Can you try to comprehend what you are responding to a little harder?
"I'm going to disagree with you on two points.

First, you still haven't addressed my issue that he can just create an alternate account and we'd never know. We can be known as an inclusive community or an exclusive community, but either way we can't actually keep him out.

Second, thievery is looked down upon in every culture I know of. Whereas there are plenty of cultures that think censorship is ok (China being one example). Much as I dislike censorship, disagree with those cultures, and think we definitely shouldn't become a censored community (and I would leave if we did), censorship isn't as globally frowned upon as thievery. If he's from a culture where censorship is normal, you can't really blame him as a person for being for censorship, when he thinks it's the best thing for bitcoin. As long as we don't give anyone promoting censorship any decision making power whatsoever, we're doing the best we can to stay an open community."
IMO, their style of writing is too different. Cobra might like some of Luke's ideas but I don't think they are the same.
OP basically said that he hates Jews and Muslims and people should give him tips for it, hence all the downvotes he got.
Like the public domain owner information? The true owner is certainly kept secret by some sort of anonymity service. Almost every registrar provides one.
Luke made some posting error a few months ago that exposed him as cobra. 
Occam's Razor
"So then how do we know if Michael Marquardt really exists? 

"
"...also can't hurt the BCH ecosystem?

Seriously, he created a coin which has the exact same issues as BTC and then sold his stake as soon as cryptomania hit, and **publicly stated he was doing it**, he's now promoting other coins which he's purchased and shouting ""bcash is a scam"".

We have nothing to fear from this guy."
"> he is harmless

The propaganda and censorship he enforces on his sites are far, far from harmless. They allowed BTC to get taken over.

We could debate about Lee if you wanted, but this is not what this thread is about. It's not an either/or situaiton."
"Sorry I still don’t get what needs uniting or the relationship to LTC. Bitcoin BCH stands alone and needs no cooperation or support from the BTC (or LTC?) sphere to be p2p cash.

Of course we want to get as many people involved as fast as possible.

I feel like I must have completely missed your point."
"this can't be eli5.

POS is Bad POW good."
I think the points were valid except the first. Us not welcoming him with open arms is not censorship in any form.
Once a snake always a snake.
"We can’t come together. We were all together until one side of the debate was censored on rbitcoin.

We will either coexist or BTC will die. Those are the two options moving forward. "

I bet he goes through these stages when choosing a master to rule over him when he visits the suggestion box for slaves."
Everyone that supported BitcoinCore's twisted pro-bank settlement layer view of Bitcoin will have to admit they were wrong. It was a serious judgement mistake that will follow them around for years.
Funny but ultimately meaningless. The success of Bitcoin Cash depends on how much people actually use it, and it does not, and should not, depend on tweets like these.

"LOL, good for u/cobra-bitcoin, if this guy is legit in all he wrote, he has some big balls to change his stance and think for himself.

One thing tho is a bit revealing: he says in his last tweet he *increased* his BCH position, meaning that he owned it before. Maybe since the fork even."
this news is nowhere to be found in r/bitcoin. He is out of the clan
Maybe he is proposing POW change for BTC as the final nail in the coffin? Makes sense...

Most people that announce support for BCH are welcomed with open arms. Why don't we let the other subreddit do the shitting on Cobra. If he's legit then I, for one, wish him welcome. If he's not then we'll know soon enough.

>>The hashrate has already been abused to give political support to reckless and dangerous hard fork attempts. They have questionable allegiance to Bitcoin at best, seeming more interested in supporting Bitcoin Cash, undermining the very network that employs them

He's not had a come to jesus moment about BCH. He doesn't respect Nakamoto consensus. He doesn't see his attempt to coerce miners, or indeed convince the community to change the poW, as the truly **centralised bitcoin takeover** that he purports to save it from.

I wouldn't stop it because clearly he's an agent of chaos and he'd fuck BTC up sooner than it would itself if he gets any traction. But we should certainly not pay the slightest attention to him.

We gain nothing from him."

So let's focus on bitcointalk.org and on bitcointalk.org. Theymos and Cobra are anonymous, we don't even know what their faces look like. While when people where wondering if Nick Szabo was a real name or a pseudonym at least we had a face.  Sirius is Martti Malmi. Again at least [we have a face.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5i33yqSbUcc) 

So here we have three people that have the keys to the kingdom, so to speak. Theymos, Cobra and Martti Malmi. 
So if I where a dictator I would simply be Theymos and Cobra at the same time, then it's always 2 vs 1. 


And it happens to be *that* Cobra that is slowly tweeting himself in to Bitcoin-BCH territory. 
One should have a look at the time all these Cobra tweets are posted and compare it with /u/Theymos activity on reddit. 

So why are Theymos and Cobra not engaged in some kind of conflict? /r/bitcoin is still heavenly censored. I don't know about bitcointalk.org but most posts there as far as I know are about promoting some coin or ICO. It's been a while since I read any useful posts over at bitcointalk.org


So let's think tactical and figure out what's going on behind the scenes. Why was Theymos okay with allowing Cobra to partly own bitoin.org and bitcointalk.org in the first place? Did Cobra pay any money for it? If so ... why would Cobra risk this investment by tweeting himself in to the BCH camp and risk a conflict with Theymos?

And what is up with the icon of a cobra and the name, what is the symbolism behind it. A forked tongue ... seriously? Does Cobra think that all of us are as naive as those people that bought physical chuck e cheese coins thinking they where buying bitcoins? 

If Cobra was stupid enough in November to tweet all these nonsense tweets. And the whole let's change the PoW algo of Bitcoin-BTC. Seriously somebody that naive... you don't want a person like that having any power over those two domain names. So what is going on? Did he recently have brain surgery or something and know suddenly he is not naive anymore?

No I am not buying any of this. if Cobra wants to be taken seriously by the Bitcoin Cash community he will have to reveal his identity and become a public persona. Something that I don't see happening. So that's the end right there.

Can we now forget about Cobra and move on? Let him tweet whatever he wants to tweet. 
He is just a distraction.

"He also didn't say he owns BCH & only BCH. Just that he increased.

Also, his next tweet is that maybe BCH & BTC communities should come together. Where's the post on that? "
To be honest, hes not really being paid much attention anyways, and his suggestions to change pow meet lots of opposition. 
"I think he has beef with Jihan Wu and the Chinese people in general. He is proposing the change POW for both chains.

https://twitter.com/CobraBitcoin/status/970777691795443713"
How about we all keep schtum about the POW change, then maybe the first time they realize how dumb they've been is when all that hashpower switches to BCH and the BTC price tanks.
I'll know he has balls when he admits Bitcoin BCH is as much Bitcoin as Bitcoin BTC and puts that on the bitcoin.org website.

You are either very new, or deliberately trolling. If it's the first don't take my comment too harshly.

When one of the gang of thieves that stole your shit is walking around the neighborhood... you let everybody know. That’s what is going on here and I am perfectly fine with it. Let him go above and beyond to prove genuine support of Bitcoin and then we can think about something else. Otherwise, raise the flag.
There is a lot of history here that runs very deep. The community is not going to get over this easily.

Yes it does. We have multiple forms of taxes in Germany. It is VAT free, but not income tax free in the form of a Veräußerungsgeschäft (= Sell Transaction), so you pay income taxes, which are usually higher than VAT.
The netherlands, and i believe germany as well, treat crypto as foreign currency or 'virtual vakue' this means they do pay capital gains over what they hold and not over what they cash out.
What if you don’t sell and instead use the crypto to buy a coffee or say a car? My understanding is that such a transaction does not trigger a capital gain (as it would in the US).  
Er, Coindesk...
A remark on these network costs displayed: Bitpay has no way of knowing how much fees you'll have to pay to transfer them the money. This extra they charge is there so *they* can move those coins afterwards. So, basically, the actual network costs are twice that.
"Because BTC is not made for small payments, for example if you pay 5$ fees for a 5$ product you pay 100% fees which sounds much but it's still only 5$.

Don't get me wrong, I personally prefer BCH over BTC, but I hate manipulation. "
What would be the point for them to do that though? Your wallet will display the exact amount you'll pay when you do the transaction.
oh i see thats how its calculated. 
$0.50 is 1% of $50. 7.9% of $50 is more like $3.95
You didn't edit anything, you liar! Now you get neither!
"[From Bitpay](https://support.bitpay.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002990803-Why-Am-I-Being-Charged-an-Additional-Network-Cost-on-My-BitPay-Invoice-):

> The extra network cost in your total invoice covers BitPay's miner fee cost to do a UTXO sweep for your payment*. You can learn more about the reasons for this extra fee here: https://blog.bitpay.com/network-costs/
 
> *Due to the insignificant average size of Bitcoin Cash miner fees, there is currently no network cost included on Bitcoin Cash invoices. If Bitcoin Cash miner fees increase to a significant level, network cost will be included in Bitcoin Cash invoice totals by default.

You still pay a fee to send the transaction, and BitPay still skims off the top before paying the merchant."
1 cent is a high fee in BCH. I usually pay less than that.
"average simple BCH transaction is 226 bytes. At a rate of 1sat/byte, one of these simple BCH transactions will cost 0.00000226 BCH.

Looks like their percentage calculation goes down 1 decimal place, so assuming the minimum percentage of 0.1%, it will take a 0.00226 BCH transaction to display a 0.1% fee

Or they are currently not charging additional BCH fees because the network actually fucking works. :)
"
How is percent not objective? 
7.9% of $5 is about $0.40. How is it a mistake?
Sure.
It seems that it is still in testing, and it has been enabled only on some selected merchants.
"ummm death please!

edit: oh no wait!  cake!  I want cake!"
"7.9% of $5 is $0.40. 

Which really isn't bad for storage in the most secure blockchain."
So are they just gonna pay the fees themselves or do the percentages just not have enough sig figs to show how little the BCH fees are?
True.  But it is easier for most people to understand than 1/5 cent.
Hahaa.. I wish I could upvote more!
That’s dope. Why would anyone use BTC for payments then?
"> Because BTC is not made for small payments

Actually it was exactly made for small payments until Core developers crippled that functionality. "
ok thats true. but they can calculate a average/median by looking at the average TX size
They cannot guess how many inputs you'll be using, so no, they cannot guess it.
"yes they can guess it.

look here:
https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/

sure they will let you pay a little more so you get the next block more likely"
Mind you, I believe this is the extra Bitpay charges you so *they* can move the money they receive from you afterwards. It does not include the fees you'll have to pay yourself to transfer them these coins, since there's no way they can guess that.

Yes I agree but BTC isn't meant for small payments, it's to buy houses, cars because it's more secure (that's what they are saying at least). In that case 5$ is pretty fair for a secure, immutable transaction but you don't need that extra securty to buy a 5$ gift card.
"I personally think there is a market for a highly secure coin for the rich to buy expensive things. If people want to pay more fees for extra security that's fine and shouldn't be attacked by Bitpay due to propaganda.

However, I think a secure coin can only be Monero because you would need privacy in that case but that's another story.

Still not fair to compare the fees percentage-wise if one is targeted at high value purchases and the other one isn't."
I just think it would be wiser to not continue the war and accept that BTC and BCH have different use cases. Instead of fighting each other they should work together. For people not involved into crypto yet the war isn't very attracting to join any of both.
Oh. In that case.... well, $0.40 to move $5 on BTC is pretty understandable. It's even lower than what I'd expect to pay to move any BTC.
"0.2 cents.

Pretty easy"
Just say under a cent.

"Network fees for any cryptocurrency are based on the *size* of the transaction data, not the amount of crypto being sent.

To say that ""$5 fees sounds like much but it's only $5"" is utterly ridiculous.

BTC fees used to be 1sat/byte. Now they are much higher. The increased $ value of BTC is irrelevant because users are still paying WAY TOO MUCH FOR FEES

1 sat/byte is all a transaction is worth. Some would argue a transaction is worth less than that (1 sat/tx)"
">Because BTC is not made for small payments

Once upon a time..."
Btc WAS made for small payments. Until shitstream, bcore, 1meg greg, and toothless Luke got their hands on it.
Sorry I meant $5, as it says in the screenshot. Not sure why I wrote $50. :-D
Hahah
to shame BTC
Can we now ask Steam if they enable Bitpay again?
Hahaha, niiiiice.
Bullish.
Fantastic! 7.9% vs 0% network cost... that's a no brainer. Bitcoin Cash, let's goooo!!  :)
"I want to accept BCH in Canada but I want to convert to CAD after. Does Bitpay allow me to do that? Would they let me convert to USD?

" i like the sexy green icon and the insane btc fees

Wow who would choose the high fee option when they put it to you like that lol 
"Doesn't work on Newegg. 

Where has this been implemented?

Does the merchant have to enable it manually? Or is the customer always given the choice?"
Seems Bitpay is pro BCH as they are showing the fees in %. Not very objective.
"Death or cake?

Hmmm, I’ll have some cake please ! "
Can we get Steam back now?
/u/GabeNewellBellevue notice me senpai
">So, basically, the actual network costs are twice that.

This is the thing if you are intermediary you pay the fees twice.. 

it also apply to miner (when using a pool).. and That’s why small block are terrible for mining decentralisation.."
"Not for Bitcoin Cash.  1 or 2-cents all the time.  So, 4-cents if they need to do another transfer of the funds.

This is what winning looks like."
"Considering that Bitpay is the largest payment processor, these fee comparison screens could end up becoming BCH's biggest ad campaign.

"
7.9% !! jesus.. that has to be a mistake??
Damn nice!
Bitstamp, Bitpanda,...
