"The Eth/Etc saga also showed to me why anyone being a maximalist of any kind is just going to be wrong. You can't be all things to all people. Etc has a core audience which is different to that of Ethereum and I'd say both communities are better as a result. I argued this at the time but perhaps it was all too raw for people to realise (and I was perhaps a little too vocal, my bad).

Bitcoin has hit the same point but for very different reasons and it's much more problematic.

Ethereum could split again around PoS although I now suspect it won't, as long as the transition is done carefully and probably through a hybrid solution.

The foundation can't actually dictate changes without community agreement. For better or worse, we already see friction between the Geth and Parity teams.

"> I'm saying that non technical users like myself should not be allowed to lead development, nowhere in my post history you will find me advocating for or against any of the dev teams.

So you've made sure that you can't be wrong by sacrificing any chance that you'll be right.

> Because it ends up in mob mentality. We are at it now. People choose sides not based on technical expertise but based on politics.

What evidence do you have that most of the people making up their mind are making a political decision? Please explain the various positions in the discussion as you see them.

> While the two latter have a gigantic share of the PC markets in their pockets, it is the linux community that is far quicker and more adaptive to solving problems/bugs.

Really? I've used Linux for a very long time, and I honestly can't say I agree with such a general statement. Maybe you're new to Linux, but go back 10 years and install Linux on a laptop, and tell me if MS or Linux has better hardware support. Linux is great for a lot of reasons, don't get me wrong, but is still has plenty of rough edges (Google ""Dirtyc0w"" for evidence that yes, Linux has some bugs).

> Same applies to the issue at hand. On one side you have btc and its developers, that belong to more than one team, on the other hand you have a vocal majority of users that attacks devs on the basis of their subjective beliefs of who is the cutest.

Huh? This is a really baffling statement. I don't know what argument you think we're having, but there are really competent devs on both sides of the issue. How did you come to the conclusion that this is users versus developers? Now I'm really confused that we're having the same argument. I'll articulate the argument as I see it: There are Bitcoin Core devs who want SegWit first, and Bitcoin Unlimited (and related clients) who want larger block sizes first. To achieve BU you'd need a hard fork.

> If we dont allow that, why should people that have a balance in their wallets be allowed to have a say in how bitcoin is to evolve?

If you're running a full wallet, you CAN decide what kinds of blocks you're going accept so you do have a (albeit tiny) voice in how the network evolves.

> Should we allow one mining company dictate the fate of the network? Should the network allow one stakeholder exercise control over it?

Who is ""we"" here, the users? Who is giving permission for anything?"
"Edeka 5% by their own sources which is pretty damn much if you ask me, caseking.de I have no idea. I'm sure a lot of people buy Amazon coupons with BTC in Germany. There are hundreds more and these are just the ones I have personally used.

But it doesn't matter. If your point is that low usage of Bitcoin means that the companies will drop Bitcoin, then by your own logic they won't add anything else to replace it, because anything else has even less usage... precisely zero. Why replace something with low (but proven) usage for something that has no proven usage, and something that EVEN LESS people use? And for what reason? Why would any business owner be interested in damaging their own investment in Bitcoin by building infrastructure for it? Just because other people who are invested in something else think theirs better? That's shilling. There is no way to tell which cryptocurrency is ""better"", they all have their problems, and convincing someone that this and that is better for this and that reason is shilling.

Like I said, it's like going to the store and trying to make them accept your new paper money bills because YOU think they are better, when noone else uses them. AND even if the store might do it... then what stops another person from doing the same thing 3 months later, with yet another new form of paper money that he claims is better?  And then another guy comes with another new form of paper type bills, and does the same thing. And then another. And so on. It's absurd to believe business owners are interested in this. They will either not do it in the first place or drop crypto altogether because it's absurd.

Bitcoin is here to stay because there are way too many companies invested in it, not just companies and startups who directly revolve around Bitcoin but ""casual"" non-internet companies who have spent time and money building an infrastructure around Bitcoin and advertising that they accept it. And people who own businesses are usually smart enough to see when other people are trying to sell snake oil. It's clear that everyone who goes off to alternatives goes there because he's invested in it and is looking for a quick get rich scheme.

This got too long, sorry."
"Yes, exactly. They won't add anything to replace it. I never claimed Ethereum would take this space. Unless of course it provides instant transactions and less fees than existing payment solution. It can't really get any worse than Bitcoin, but this just doesn't seem to be the strong point of crypto in general in the current state of the tech, for neither Bitcoin or Ethereum. The fact is that big money is just not interested in this use case beyond spicing their BTC holdings, at least for now. Bitcoin is just expensive as hell to be able to compete with existing payment infrastructure on a meaningful level.

Also, there are not that many people invested in Bitcoin at all. It's really 99.99% startups with 'Bit' as part of the company name, or in some way related to crypto in general. Now compare that to this: https://www.infoq.com/news/2017/03/Enterprise-Ethereum

I've always been a Bitcoin supporter, but after years of stagnation and a clearly superior superset gaining significant adoption and actual corporate backing, I'm just out. It's just too little too late, and the community just seems really stuck in the same mindset as in 2013, while the world around them kept revolving and innovating."
"It's just meant to show that there is a real world infrastructure behind Bitcoin that is here to stay for a while. And just because Bitcoin has issues currently does not mean other cryptos are safe from having their own issues; or that it is impossible to get rid of the issues and improve Bitcoin. But the infrastructure is there and it's growing."
"ISNâ€™T THIS ALL JUST FUD


yes"
Don't expect too much too fast of things like Raiden. All these techs are 2-3 year projects in reality. The difference is that developers are unified behind the direction and the underlying tech supports things without nasty hacks.
"So how many clients do you honestly think they serve with Bitcoin? You are an exception. Bitcoin is not even particularly good at this use case to begin with. They're probably using a centralized company to take on all the risk and to be able to provide instant transactions. A feature that is actually planned for Ethereum without the need for centralized authority.

Bitcoin has paved the way for great things, and the world will be forever thankful for that. But after years of no innovation, the world is moving on."
What's going on in BTC is a big pile of knowledge (and warnings) for development and governance of any other blockchains. Just like everybody in BTC is now warning about replay attacks.
"let me try to reply to your comments, one by one:

>So you've made sure that you can't be wrong by sacrificing any chance that you'll be right.

Would you be fine with non-coders coding, releasing patches and determining the course of the project?
My position is that non-coders should not do that.

>What evidence do you have that most of the people making up their mind are making a political decision?

There are more people that are not coders or cannot sufficiently evaluate the technical aspects of the debate, than there are coders, this is self evident in the crypto space. Unless you believe that all users are familiar with the codebase of btc

>Really? I've used Linux for a very long time...Linux has some bugs).

I did not say that linux had better hardware support ten years ago, i'm saying that as things are now, linux is by far quicker to respond to bugs, due to the community of coders being quite larger, and the ability to spot and fix bugs is not bottlenecking at the company profits.
There are more WinXP pcs out there than there are win10, try getting support for those machines today if you are not a bank, or a megacorp.

>Same applies to the issue at hand...who is the cutest

What do you mean how do i get to the conclusion it is users vs devs? Go through both r/btc & r/bitcoin posts in re scaling debate. There are users on both side of the fence using only ad hominems against the developers of the ""opposite"" team. The vast majority of users are not capable of determinig which side is right(if there can be such a thing) and are taking sides largely based on personal holdings and political beliefs, not ability to analyze code.

>If you're running a full wallet...evolve

So, people who have a balance in their savings account should dictate monetary policies? Should a construction worker be allowed to have a say in how the FED/ECB or any commercial bank determines its course? I believe we should let monetary policies to economists, strategic planning to strategist, war making to soldiers. To each his own.

>Who is ""we""

""We"" as in the collective ""We"", should the btc community allow one company, be it Blockstream or Bitmain to have absolute control over the network? My position is that no, we should not.

I hope that helps a bit.

"
I agree that Bitcoin won't just instantly die. But it will really take a miracle for it to not be overtaken by Ethereum at this point. Years mean centuries in tech innovation. And years have been lost. I am by no means saying that the Ethereum roadmap will be smooth sailing, but the development team and huge development community inspire confidence by carefully planning and openly discussing this roadmap. That is also why reaching consensus has so far been rather effortless. I honestly don't see Bitcoin infrastructure growing so much, especially compared to Ethereum. Lately there has been mostly news of large companies like Circle leaving Bitcoin. Either for Ethereum or sometimes even out of crypto entirely.
"caseking.de

edeka.de (this is THE BIGGEST grocery company in Germany)

That is PC parts and groceries which covers like 80% of the shit I buy. I bet I can buy clothes and other neccessities with Bitcoin too. And the German Amazon has literally EVERYTHING and there is a website that sells you amazon coupons for Bitcoin (yeah it would be better if Amazon accepted it directly but who knows what is to come). Ive bought so much shit with bitcoin I dont even have a wallet anymore.

And a company like Edeka is way too big to have ANY interest at all in the fuckery and drama that happens in the Bitcoin world with altcoins and whatnot. They don't care about anything that gets posted on subreddits like these or on the internet, they accepted Bitcoin because of the network effect and are surely not going to add 100 other ones or drop Bitcoin and add something else when it's all just based on shilling. It's literally trying to go to the store and trying to make them accept your new paper money with special security features that you invented yourself, when everyone is already using Euro.
"
"https://btcmanager.com/the-first-bitcoin-store-of-the-world-opens-in-vienna/

Also this, this just opened this month. You think the person who opened that store cares about the fact that people on here have their panties up in a bunch? She opened a Bitcoin store, she's not going to rebrand it to a Ethereum or any other altcoin store because of FUD and shilling, she opened a business and chose Bitcoin because Bitcoin is the only thing that matters and Bitcoin is established. And let alone the fact that the normal customer who barely understands Bitcoin would be confused as fuck if companies start accepting all these other ""internet monies"" or are extremely volatile in their infrastructure in terms of what they accept and what they don't accept. It's too confusing, and the people who run this know that, that's why they don't even bother."
The problem is that nobody cares about these kind of stores. It has been proven well enough now that that is just not the strong point of Bitcoin, or even Ethereum thus far. This is also not where the money flows. I'm amazed how some people still seem to be stuck in 2013 with regards to the contemporary use cases of crypto. It's literally more expensive for them to accept Bitcoin than it is to just take debit card payments. The reason such a store gets opened is because the owner is holding a lot of BTC and is a Bitcoin fan. It's really that simple. On a pragmatic level, it is completely nonsensical to use Bitcoin for these kind of payments, especially in a country like Austria.
"Actually, it's none of my business, and my question was rhetorical.

"Because I agree. It isn't secret at all. Thus, publishing links to a completely public repository is merely amplifying words and ideas which were published publically *anyway* and by linking to the **fix itself**, your accusation of ""ill intentions"" is, of course, proven false.

"Nothing has been ""proven false."" 

I'm still convinced that Peter was having some fun at the expense of BU, and that drawing extra attention to the bug wasn't some random act of kindness on his part. At the very least, he definitely wanted to damage BU's reputation.

"> my question was rhetorical

No it wasn't, you just were just to stupid to realise the obvious answer."
".. knowledge of the fix, regardless of whether users are able to make use of it, *gives the power to decide into the hands of the users themselves.* Additionally, since it was amplifying the *public words of the people who wrote the fix itself* how could it be anything but a public good?

And no, it's not useless, since it gave people information they could use to *decide to shut down their node* until a fix was available in a form they could use.

Since the bug was being actively exploited *prior to the tweets,* the damage had already been done by the original publishing of the fix, and in fact pointing out that an active attack was going on *is a public service which people needed to mitigate ongoing damage.*
"
"They were *already finding out the hard way* since the attack was well underway prior to the tweets. In fact, since that was happening, the tweets provided a *strongly likely reason for the crashes as well as a pointer for those users who could use it, and a reason to shut nodes down for those who couldn't.*
