"Do you mean ""the end of June"" or ""the end of July""?"
"Sorry I wasn't ware of that ! 

This is totally awesome, another proof that alternative implementation are vital for btc community at large. "
My comment was a reply to the plan for miners to get 90%...
Thanks.
"Actually, they are interested in an alternative implementation to Core's small-block approach. Consensus is forming and they will act at the end of this month if something isn't changed.

It's funny how you've taken facts and twisted them to support your opinion. Read up on confirmation bias and you'll stop disillusioning yourself."
Lol, you literally just named 4 other possible reasons for long term rise. But I was never talking about the bull market. just about the fact that it jumped specifically after this news.
Seg wit and lightning will fix that.
I'm pretty patient. When transactions stop confirming there will be an exodus from small block supporters.
The price also jumped when I took a big dump in the toilet. Must be correlated!
I've read it. The miners are not interested in Classic. What's your point?
Oh, I agree he should move on as promised.  Just pointing out that Reddit subs aren't allowed to be sold so he'd have to turn it over to someone else or sell it on the down low.
"you haven't seen the 'dipshit' comment at this point?

I'll let you googlefu it out yourself, it's not hard to find

edit: he publicly called Adam Back and the signers of the HK agreement 'dipshits', which can, and I suspect was, taken as an insult to *everyone* that signed the agreement.

I'm not surprised they are getting pissed and this move by them is brilliant. No matter what 2MB is coming from either Core or Classic at this point.

Sun Tzu strikes again!"
"That was historical - that happened months ago.

The option was and is always on the table, and they've come to realize that what Brian Armstrong was telling them was true.

I guess you haven't been following closely?"
yeah now i see you downvoting me not sure how much you get paid from blockscheme but let me tell you that the most smart economic people say that miners are the sales and the other people are the customers it is very simple if you dont have another agenda and you want to delay the unlimiting of the blocksize
">wouldn't break anything

other than their business plan."
"Miners don't *control* Bitcoin, but they can certainly exert a great deal of influence over its direction -- particularly in the short-term. (But I agree that the economic majority is ultimately in control.)  Related thoughts:

Well, what the miners say is the law of the land. Remember that always.
And Core-Rekts-It !! Both are fitting in their own way.
link to Greg's statement?
Funny, that was my entry point for KoreCoinz.
oh, that?  Yes, I remember that, but I would think that luke-jr's 'miners have no leverage' statement from last week would be far more offensive to the miners.  I thought you meant that Greg had made some statements in support of or along with that.
">The American delegation in China had a software proposal, known as Bitcoin Classic, that would change all that.
The Chinese companies, though, had the ultimate decision-making power over any changes in the software, and they did not agree with the American delegation. The Chinese had thrown in their lot with another group of longtime programmers who wanted to keep Bitcoin smaller, in part to keep it more secure. The Americans hoped to persuade the Chinese to switch sides.
In a hotel conference room, the American team of about a half-dozen people cycled through its PowerPoint slides, in English and Chinese, arguing for expansion of the network, most notably pointing to the long delays that have been plaguing the system as a result of the congestion. The Chinese representatives listened and conferred among themselves. The group took a break for a lunch of lamb and dumplings at a nearby mall.

“We kept coming back and saying, ‘For better or worse, you have this leadership in the industry, and everyone is looking to you to show some leadership,’” said Brian Armstrong, chief executive of Coinbase.
Ultimately, Mr. Armstrong said, “We were unable to convince them."
"Next thing you know you will be claiming transaction fees have no significant influence on Bitcoin's economy ;). 

Friction, efficiency, enabling more trade. Should be relevant. 

Or should I hack an exchange to proof exchanges are important? "
Well, don't believe the story above - you're bound to be disappointed.
Didn't downvote you buddy. Never go full conspiritard.
"And somehow the term ""economic dependent"" sounds like something you put on an IRS form. It also sounds like something completely different from ""economically important"". 

Why don't we say ""economically important""? Did Core make this term up?"
This is incredibly unhelpful regardless of which team you support or how badly you feel their behavior is.
"Oh really? http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/03/business/dealbook/bitcoin-china.html

You're clearly desperate to not believe it. Users, miners and businesses are tired of Core's BS."
must be a lot of blockschemers around then
Hahaha, Brilliant!!
The price has been rising steadily after core won against the competing forks. Why is that the case if the markets love the core alternatives so much?
July
I felt good reading it.
