"> ""Blockchain"" is currently a buzzword like ""Cloud"". It doesn't mean jack shit.

I think you're being unfair to cloud. When services are offered on the cloud these days, there is usually a pretty good reason that's hard to argue with in most cases. Generally to do with economies of scale  - renting capacity on large scale shared platforms is most often cheaper, easier and more reliable than buying and operating your own dedicated system. Everyone can understand that.

But can everyone understand why blockchain is better than cloud? To me this is much more difficult, as the essence of the argument seems to rely on paranoia  (you can't trust anybody!) rather than simple economics (it's cheaper!)."
