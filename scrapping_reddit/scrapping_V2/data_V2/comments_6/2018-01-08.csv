"> Make non-important / meaningless. Yes.

You didn't take anything away from the gif this thread is about did you? You're parroting 'open source' as some infallible good just like the Cabinet members in the gif parrot 'decentralization.' 

Third parties can't possibly know the proper supply of a good to produce and the price at which it should be sold (see the Soviet Union, 1930's America). Only businesses in the space can determine that as informed by market demand. That the third party in question, Core, is open source doesn't mean they know any better the proper amount of supply in block space needed to meat the demand for Bitcoin block space anymore so than a dictator, a bureaucrat, or a group of democratically elected officials. Giving power to an open source project to set supply is as moronic as any of the latter mentioned groups. 

> Bitcoin has a secure chain. Humble up and be happy we have it / slow down.

I never said the chain wasn't secure, just that high fees aren't a result of the security but the artificially limited block space for transactions. We could have orders of magnitude more transactions included with the same amount of security/hashpower."
And you would need 100% consensus, otherwise it would cause a fork.
Not only this...but I believe we will have drive chains for localized trading regions where it will be still quite easy to run a node for these purposes (then you will do trustless atomic swaps between/among sidechain coins).

Perhaps less wise and more costly of your time, you could look at just the first point, or the summary at the end. 

In any case, here it is...

> neat technology for preventing replication of a digital token

Maybe that's the result, maybe not. It certainly isn't the stated goal and stated work.  

It seems this technology was theoretically meant to be decentralized or distributed, and that in practice, it is still the stated goal. In Bitcoin's case, the idea of non-centralization is in the literal title of the white paper as ""Peer-to-Peer."" 

In the case of other coins (and non-coin blockchain and blockchain-like projects), decentralization or distributed control is sometimes the main stated goal or at least a key element baked into the tech. Sure, the stated goals could be BS and/ or the practical reality could be a miss.

In fact, there have been notable failures and many claims of failure (naming particular private entities that could have inordinate or complete control). I remain unconvinced that it has been proven unsuccessful. 

I also don't see as much as hoped of the opposite of ""throwing logic out the window"".

To prove, with logic clearly kept fully inside the window, that decentralization and distributed control technology has failed utterly and can't succeed, I will seek the same arguments made earlier in a way I can hear better (or, if I'm not failing here, made in a better way--more complete, more conclusive, possibly completely differently made).

Perhaps I'll conclusively hear of the specific private entity, one each, that controls or will control a majority of each of the top currencies, as we're on the way to private entities to eventually control all of them. 

Even without specific entities, providing reasoned, thorough logic why failure and centralized control will eventually happen would be just as good as specific examples, if it were relatively air-tight.

The comments here have attempted the latter, I think--I'm just not seeing or fully-grasping the link between the ideas and their proof. The ideas certainly do support the conclusions, if they are proven.

The conclusions seem like a valid concern. They don't seem like a certainty. I remain open minded about them, as I remain open minded about decentralization and distributed control systems.

-------------------

NOTE: The following goes into governing and regulating banks. You're a saint if you got this far, and doubly so if you continue.

As for the government, banks, motives, regulations, history, and current developments--those things I know better than some. My education, upbringing (I grew up in the world of the now-defunct NY investment bankers), some of my work, and current direct knowledge is not fully consistent with what you describe about ""thousands of years"" and where we are.

Independent of what I'm seeing with my own eyes, the general public is also aware of tremendous failures of the government to function as independent of private entities, with the interest of the people over those entities--so much so that one or ten bullet points would understate and even misstate the case. Private individuals and groups have had tremendous success with influence and even direct control over legislation and regulation. The trend lately has famously, and with very clear detail, been the opposite of the suggested governance. 

I'm claiming this is well known, even infamous. Asking me to provide examples is not necessary for disagreeing or agreeing. If you don't agree and immediately think of more than a dozen non-edgelord headlines, key platform elements, proposed laws, protests, non-crypto ponzi schemes, failures in regulations, conflicts of interest, partial or serious evidence of plutocracy, etc., then we can, with confidence and finality, agree to disagree without going any further. Your time is valuable.

I'm not saying you agree with the conclusion that we have a plutocracy or are suffering from major related trends and developments. I'm suggesting you might know what I'm thinking of when I say government not being accountable enough can't be so quickly dismissed.   

Crypto may have failed to replace this ""advancement,"" but the advancement has rolled itself back quite notably, and quite outside the recognition of edgelords. 

2008 was mainly a failure of the problems with the ""advancement"". Our further failing to intelligently advocate a reduced version of Dodd-Frank (which is a failure of grown-up edgelords) could lead to the opposition doing more than a minor dilution of it. This will lead to bankers taking major risks, with no power (or desire) by the decision makers and enforcers in the government to mitigate them.

Put simply, if people worth $300 MM could be worth $1-2 billion or more, with only a 1-in-10 chance of another 2008, they'll not only take it, they'll fight tooth-and-nail for it, with power and a great likelihood of success. 

Run that last sentence by a conservative, non-edgelord expert. Not a professor--a banker. I stake there are people who take it seriously and have (and have earned) the opportunity to present it to several top government movements (Kasich, Warren, Clinton, Trump, Sanders all). Maybe there are plenty of ideas that are crazy that are presented at the highest levels. 2017 certainly has show that to happen. Still, this one rings true to me. 

By the way, that's the optimistic and/ or interest-conflicted view of those who stand a chance to put their worth in the billions. It is my understanding the risk is much worse than 1 in 10 and that the result could be worse than 2008 by a long shot.

Overall/ TL;DR:

I haven't grasped the explanation of the parts I'm still learning about (existing failures of decentralization; logical reasons that predetermine those failures; and/ or the tech not even attempting decentralization) in such a way that it stands as supported.

The parts I do know well directly contradict the generalizations and assertions made here about governance and regulation. "

"A block size increase would _obviously_ split the network because it is highly contentious. This much should be clear if you have paying attention for the last 6-24 months. 

Now, the reason it is contentious is because a lot of people believe it will result in validating nodes becoming harder to run thus leaving the network less trustless. Some feel that a doubling alone along with SegWit adoption, resulting in a max block size of 8MB is already too much. Others think it's probably fine but would be a slippery slope down towards more ""easy"" solutions."
We know that because it can be seen in already existing cryptos.
">If bitcoin is a system just to transfer bitcoin from wallet to wallet then its working perfectly and there's no problems.

That's actually exactly what bitcoin is. What else do you think it is?

Buying and selling bitcoin for other currencies on an exchange does not use the bitcoin network. No actual transactions are confirmed on the bitcoin blockchain when you buy or sell BTC on an exchange. On-exchange trades do not contribute to the 350,000 transactions per day, *which are coins being sent from one bitcoin address to another bitcoin address.*

If you were to buy an apple with some dogecoin, you would send some coin from your dogecoin wallet to the merchant's dogecoin wallet. This is using dogecoin as a currency.

If you owed someone $100 and you made an agreement to pay them in IOTA, you would send some coin from your IOTA wallet to their IOTA wallet. This is using IOTA as a currency.

If you wanted to give someone a gift, and sent some ether to them with a touching birthday message, you would send some coin from your ethereum wallet to their ethereum wallet. This is using ether as a currency.

A currency settles debts. Period. That's what it is.

>Actual metrics of how many merchants accept it

Not being accepted by merchants does not equal not being used at all. You wouldn't say that gold is useless because merchants don't accept it. You wouldn't say that cheeseburgers are useless because merchants don't accept it. You wouldn't say that American Express is useless because it's only accepted at 1 of the 2 grocery stores you go to. These toenail clippers are not useless because I can't open my beer with them!

The data is there and easy to interpret. If it's used one time, then it's used one time and you can't truthfully say it is ""not being used"" or it's ""useless"". It obviously was useful for that one person, one time. The word ""useful"" does not mean ""useful for you, personally"".

Bitcoin is used about 350,000 times every single day. That is a simple fact.

>Actual metrics of how many merchants accept it, and how many black markets accept it are down, not up.

I was a late adopter in late 2011 and to me, actually using bitcoin was more important than HODLing as a store of (potential value). I could buy and sell and transfer in seconds for practically no fee whatsoever.

I can't imagine how new adopters can wrap their heads around what is going on and although I don't have or hold any BCH just legacy, I'm starting to wonder whether the teams that work with legacy infrastructure have bitcoins best interest in mind.

It needs to be simplified and the power needs to be given back to the people,  not a bunch of miners and Dev's essentially holding progress hostage.

"Yes it was a compromise. It doesn’t matter who was at the fucking meeting. Sometimes you have representatives handling major issues for everyone. It didn’t need to be made into a sinister, evil plot. It wasn’t. 

The reason they’re not adopting it now is because there is no on chain scaling. SW was only half of the agreement. That’s why they’re not adopting it. Your entire perception of reality is  skewed. No offense."
Blocksize is independent of hash rate. Bitcoin is only expensive because the central planners of Core have set an artificial cap on supply of block space. If BCH had the same share of hash rate BTC has now it would have the same level of security but fees would remain low due to free block space.
At this point - who cares.... I think they got the bitcoin that they wanted... great for them.  We should be reinforcing their active decision to remain at 1 megabyte.  This was a hard four years in the making.

"Any use of bitcoin is necessarily a wallet to wallet transfer. I don’t understand why you’re differentiating between using it to make a payment and using it as a currency. It’s literally the same thing.

How can it be used as a currency without coin being transferred wallet to wallet?

“Being used as a currency” is not the same thing as “exchanged with a merchant for goods and services”.

If your grandma gave you a $100 bill for Christmas, that was her using dollars as a currency.

The primary function of a currency is to settle debts.

>Bitcoins market share has gone from over 90% to under 35%. If you think its usefulness as a currency is either A) irrelevant or B) not decreasing, then look forward to seeing that share drop to 0 eventually.


Market share is relative. In an growing market, a commodity can have increasing usage while having a declining market share.

You keep saying its use is decreasing, but the [data](https://blockchain.info/charts/n-transactions) indicates otherwise. "
"I don't understand why you seem to think this is a fight.

What I am saying here is that this post is misrepresenting the connection between block size and decentralization, and the argument for the bitcoin blockchain keeping it's current block size.

Cryptocurrencies are financial instruments. You should be thinking rationally and economically about them... not emotionally as if they are sports teams with rival fandoms.

>You could try actually saying something substantive.

This post is literally just misrepresenting people's position and calling people names for disagreeing. If you're here to make sure people are saying things that are substantive, then isn't it hypocritical to be attacking me for pointing out how misleading and unsubstantial this post is?

>Are you OK with the current bitcoin (ftfy) transaction fees?

Have I come to terms with existing in a Universe that contains a cryptocurrency named ""bitcoin"" that has a 1GB block size and transaction fees of a few dozen dollars? I promise you that I am not losing a single second of sleep over it, because of all the things that are good ideas to become emotionally involved in, the monetary policy of financial instruments is not one of them.

Do I think that bitcoin core have made the best decision about block size? I don't know. I do know that this post is not helping anyone make a rational decision about that, because it is inaccurate and intellectually dishonest.

Bitcoin is a financial instrument. When I need to use a financial instrument, I think rationally and economically and pick the right instrument for my use. I don't hold grudges against the instruments which are not useful to me, and neither should you.

You seem to be implying (by asking if I am ""OK"" with the current BTC transaction fees) that you are ""not OK"" with them. What exactly do you mean? In what sense are you ""not OK"" with it? It offends you? It goes against your religion? You believe there should be a moderate adjustment to policy?
 You can't tolerate sharing a Universe with it? You think it's unethical? You can imagine some unintended negative consequences? You think it's an evil plot to overthrow peace and justice? What are you trying to ask? What exactly do you mean by ""OK""?"

What markets do you see as needing a solution? I'd love to hear it."
">I don’t understand why you’re differentiating between using it to make a payment and using it as a currency.

I'm differentiating between buying and selling bitcoin as an asset with currency, and using it as a currency to buy/sell goods and services.

There's a meaningful difference between these two concepts, I don't care what words you want to use to describe these two concepts, we can use whatever words you want (i prefer ""currency"" and ""asset""), so long as we actually establish there's a meaningful difference between these two things, and have different words to describe them.

buying and selling or transferring ownership an asset doesn't make it a currency. trading for goods and services does. increased daily transactions does not prove use as currency is up when the vast majority of those transactions are on exchanges. All that shows is more people are speculating on the price and buying and selling it as an asset. Actual metrics of how many merchants accept it, and how many black markets accept it are down, not up.

 If people stopped driving cars as much and I said ""car use is down"", and you responded with ""but people are still buying and selling the same number of cars so thats not true"", we are clearly not talking about the same thing. It's a semantic game to use two different definitions of the word ""use"" and pretend that there isn't really any difference between driving a car and buying and selling a car because its all just ""using"" cars.

>How can it be used as a currency without coin being transferred wallet to wallet?

The fact using it as a currency would require moving it from wallet to wallet (which it actually doesn't if you bought things by physically handing over a pen drive with keys), doesn't mean any time it moves from wallet to wallet its being used as a currency. If its not being used as a medium of exchange its just people buying and selling it for fiat. It is what is being exchanged.

>If your grandma gave you a $100 bill for Christmas, that was her using dollars as a currency.

Just because you can transfer ownership of a currency doesn't mean anything you transfer ownership of is a currency. 

You're abstracting currency down to some abstract you can ""use"" or ""transfer"", ignoring the actual definition of currency which is a medium of exchange used to buy and sell goods and service. Just because you can ""use"" or ""transfer"" something doesn't make it a currency.

Ok, I had a major misscoeception about LN channels, I thought coins could hop from one channel to another, your metal rod with beads in makes more sense and suffers less from what I described (but still Bob could close the channel and move the coins to another wallet, risking losing all the coins in that channel, but if he spent them all he has nothing to lose and everything to win by doing it)
"> you go to buy a coffee from the shop, but find that your channel with the shop does not have enough funds to pay for the coffee... because Bob already spent your channels balance to pay Carol.

So how does what you said make any sense?"
lighting.network
Then Bitcoin Cash has a problem because Bitcoin Core will work again like it is suppose to. But Bitcoin Core also has a problem because raising the blocksize is basically them saying: We where wrong the Bitcoin Cash developers where right. When that happens you will have two Bitcoins claiming to be Bitcoin and both of them working like Bitcoin. Will they coexist? Nobody knows. Will one die? Nobody knows. But at least both Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin will be usable and that is good for Bitcoin users. Now Bitcoin Core users that have small amounts of Bitcoin stuck can finally unstuck those.  Maybe a lot of users will not trust Bitcoin Core anymore and switch to Bitcoin Cash. It's just impossible to predict.  But it is very unlikely that after 4 years of being super stubborn about the block size limit suddenly Bitcoin Core would change it's mind. 
Yup. These are developers. They don’t know how to run projects. They know how to write code. That’s why we have project managers that interface with all parties in the ecosystem.

"> Yes, I've heard that argument, but is clearly false when discussing an 8 MB block-size limit.

But how is it clearly false? It's false because one group vs the other says so? That's what I get so frustrated about, this ""yes it will"", ""no it won't"" argument without either side bringing something to the table to back it up.

> and it would have absolutely no effect on centralisation of mining nodes, so that argument falls apart.

So you're saying that the increase of the block size limit did not, and will not impact the miners in any way whatsoever? No increase in bandwidth requirements, no increase in storage requirements, nothing? That would be the first I've heard of that zero-impact change.

"Bob has no direct connection to Carol. The only path to Carol from Bob in the example is Bob to me to shop to Carol.

Coin cannot leave a channel and hop to another channel. If Bob wants to pay Carol, Bob has to pay me after I agree to pay the coffee shop, who must also agree to pay Carol after I pay the shop. The coin that Carol gets is not actually the coin from Bob. Bob paid that to me.

Imagine channels like a metal rod with beads on it (like an abacus). Payment can happen by sliding some beads from one end to the other. Beads cannot be taken off one channel (rod) and placed onto the next."

"I strongly support blocksize increases, but financially speaking, BTC is likely going to continue to be dominant for some time.  If BCH gains dominance (and I hope it does), it will likely take significant adoption by retailers and lots of practical use to drive that.  This will take time.

I think the smart thing to do $$ wise is to hedge with both.  With the coins I held from before the fork, I did re-balance somewhat to favor BCH, but not to a great extent.  Especially with the uncertainty and EDA nonsense in the beginning, it seemed like a longshot to take off.  Things have stabilized, sure, but there remains significant risk.

And while we have seen some txn cost pain, it's not enough to dissuade large investors.  The price action outweighs whatever technical concerns they might have."

Surely, miners will always go along with the network, and won't go against their own interests... But I'd like to avoid the possibility of bad scenario for sure."

">Why do you think that? Segwit2x was rejected because it didn't have sufficient consensus. I don't ever see the blocksize changing without consensus even if the changes are merged into an active repo. 

Because there is only a single actively developed implementation on BTC and only a single person has commit access to it.  This is in direct contrast to BCH which as multiple active dev teams.  Segwit2x was called off because Jihan Wu who controls a majority of hash power decided to abandon it.  

I personally believe Jihan doesn't care about anything other than making money like any ration business man.  So he simply decided to continue to make money on BCH while also creating a huge fee market on BTC.  Lets get this clear if the Chinese miners really wanted to raise the block limit it would have happened ages ago as they control a majority of the has power.  However, if they came out and said this publicly the community would raise the block size even if the wasn't the chain with the most work.  So instead Jihan publicly calls for the block size to be raised by supporting BCH while keeping the 1MB block limit in place and reaping hundreds of millions in fees on BTC.

">I see both. That’s the whole problem. Half the people say it will increase centralization, the other half say it won’t. Neither have the data to back it up. 

It's impossible to prove a negative, prove to me there isn't an invisible tea pot orbiting the sun between earth and Mars. I need the information on why someone believes something to be true in order to disprove that evidence.

But most of the disproving would probably revolve around the fact that miners already need specialized hardware, so increasing block size would only add more storage to that hardware (and storage is by far the cheapest part). And it would require the person to understand that only miners count when we're talking about bitcoins decentralization.
"
"I don't agree with that. It's true it may be correlated, as more hash power would tend to mean more actors participating. However it is technically possible for a single actor to control all hash power (technically, I know it's a ridiculous thought) even if that hash power is the sum of all current hash power.

It is also possible that every person on the planet could be mining on a raspberry pi. This is arguably more decentralized, but the hash rate would be much lower."
"no this isn't really right

a block is a list of transactions, but bitcoin was made so these blocks would never be 'full'

the people who 'mine' the bitcoins and confirm the transactions are the ones that put the txs into blocks. So you can pay a fee on your tx, the idea is that the more you pay the more likely your transaction will be included in the block (blocks are found bout every 10 mins)

a few people took control of the code and changed how bitcoin works so that blocks would be full

previously transactions could be free and very close to it, without full blocks there is no reason to have high fees. The creator of bitcoin envisioned that in 30-40 years there would be enough people that all the small fees would may the miners

but since bitcoin was taken over the blocks have not grown like the creator of Bitcoin wanted, and so the fees are high. this is partly why people are leaving legacy bitcoin and moving to other things (like bitcoin cash for instance)"
Bitcoin Cash doesn't need a hard fork to increase the 8mb. It can increase all the way to 32mb without actually requiring a hard fork. 
"The plan has always been to always have more than enough capacity for whatever the demand is; there won't be a split, Bitcoin will upgrade as intended."
"I'll tell you. 

Blocks will continue to be full and fees will still rise. 

Unless Bitcoin core has lighting ready to go or raises the blocksize, Bitcoin Cash will continue picking up adoption where Bitcoin Core left off. "
What's the transaction ID? 
"I started to have flashbacks to this idiocrazy scene as I was trying to reason with people on a dutch forum. Damn blockstream was really affective with creating like 10 000 parots or something, all they ever do is just repeat stuff ..... 

 So yeah the gif wrote itself, only took me maybe 10 minutes or something to write down the text. /u/PedanticPendant did most of the work.  But I had no idea we would get so many upvotes. I knew it was good I just did not know it was THAT good. 

Also I just want to say that Electron Cash is working very very well for me and seeing those green notifications when money comes in is awesome. I know it was forked from Electrum (did you work on Electrum to?) but still thanks for all your work! "
Number 3.   Period. Sit back and watch. I keep saying this over and over. I’ll say it again. Developers don’t know how to create market-ready products. They know how to write code. They have little awareness of the ecosystem, and even less concern for end users. They create shit that nobody uses. That’s why developers don’t run projects. They’re told what to do by people with a more well-rounded understanding of the priorities. 
Yes, I've heard that argument, but is clearly false when discussing an 8 MB block-size limit.  You could easily still run full nodes in your home with an 8 MB cap.  Even a 16 MB or 32 MB or 64 MB cap would *not* preclude you from running a full node, and it would have absolutely no effect on centralisation of mining nodes, so that argument falls apart.  I still have yet to hear a single rational argument from anyone as to why a block size cap increase to 8 MB would lead to centralisation at all.  With a simple increase in the block-size cap the BTC user experience would improve dramatically, with far lower tx fees and faster confirmation times. 
"I don't think there is a negative to prove. In fact the way I see it is that BTC people really should have to prove that the amount of work or hardware specs caused by the dreaded 8MB block size would be outside the realm of possibility for everyday people.

Your argument is that it already requires specialized hardware, so what difference does extra storage make. This doesn't help the case that it would not lead to centralization.
"
"Tippr is a centralised service at the grace of whoever maintains it...

Bigger blocks can be done, but let’s first look into other scaling solutions. Big services are completely inefficient with their usage of the network. Give them bigger blocks and the will be full in no time. It’s like a little kid complaining about his small bedroom while leaving his stuff all over the place. 

The misinformation here: bitcoin core development is ruled by blockstream, blockstream is a puppet of Axa and banks. Blockstream pays people to spread fud. Moore’s Law will solve everything. Bitcoin Cash development is decentralised while most of the work is done by Deadalnix, who calls himself a benevolent dictator. The list goes on."
"My entire point is that no one individual or group can ""raise the blocksize"" and keep consensus. We are going in circles, you keep missing my point.

It's fine if you disagree. But please don't miss my point twice when doing so."
"[Not true](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7gbfuw/a_massive_collection_of_reasons_why_segregated/) the legacy codebase has been changed and is now much more complex which means it's harder to add new things and harder to get investors and new developers to understand it.

Bitcoin cash dones't have these complicated chagnes that makes future work more difficult"
"BCH largest node implementation has 82% market share.  BTC largest implementation is 88% with a majority of the other clients being old depreciated software that hasn’t been taken offline like 217 UASF nodes and BTC 1 noses.  The rest such as bitcoin unlimited, classic and xt developers now support Bitcoin Cash so its dishonest to say they are Bitcoin Core software.

You also completely ignored me calling out /r/bitcoin spreading FUD by lying about Microsoft not accepting bitcoin core as being unverified a day after the news had been verified. I would like to hear your thoughts on this."
Because that's how protocols work. 
"> but let’s first look into other scaling solutions

BTC and BCH camps disagree on the order. I'm siding with early Bitcoin, which continues in Bitcoin Cash: bigger blocks first, Counterparty-like L2 implementations second. If LN works, it'll work better on Bitcoin Cash chain

> will be full

Not when Bitcoin Cash upgrades to abjustible blocksize. Blocks will get as big as miners can handle and as big as there will be demand for

> The misinformation here

Call it when u see it. There's no ""official r/btc opinion"" just crowd wisdom which cnanges with the crowd. As crypto will become more and more popular, crowd will get dumber and dumber. Trust no one, do your research. No truthful sources by default"
"The negative here is that bigger blocks wouldn't cause centralization, I need to know why the person thinks 8mb is enough to cause centralization.

>Your argument is that it already requires specialized hardware, so what difference does extra storage make. This doesn't help the case that it would not lead to centralization.

Why do you think it doesn't help? A 1TB HD costs 50USD (and will last over two years of 8mb blocks), while a S9 miner costs 1350USD and probably will be obsolete in two years due to hash difficulty, 50 extra USD seem to make little difference. And realistically by the time BCH gets a 1TB blockchain 1TB Will be thumb drive capacity."
"Yeah. If you know how to code, check this out:

https://github.com/Bitcoin-ABC/bitcoin-abc/blob/master/src/validation.cpp

Look for blocksize()

If you don't know how to code, basically the block size can be adjusted without the need of a software upgrade. You just have to change it in the configuration file. "
They'll still have the toxic centralized dev team, and shit like RBF and the technical debt of the clunky segwit implementation.
"You may have been banned in r\/bitcoin for such suggestion.

r\/btc has no such moderation policy, you'll be fine here.

That said, SegWit adoption isn't going anywhere. Users that have old coins have to pay the fee no matter what - that ""incentive to switch"" *doesn't exist* because you only spend a coin once. Why create a whole new wallet and pay the full fee now, *and a SegWit fee later*, instead of just waiting to pay that full fee when you spend and skipping the extra wallet? It's another senseless waste of money - and, well, Bitcoin already has enough ways to do that. Merchant adoption will be great for ... those merchants, and nobody else. Coinbase isn't in a hurry to do it because *they* don't get a savings out of it either. With all the crowing and barking about fee reduction by SegWit, all that has actually happened is that fees have gone from 5 cents to 10 dollars. A 75% discount on a $10 fee does not sound better than a 5 cent fee."

"I think this is the future; corporations and states will pay to operate nodes, even if the costs are fairly high, as a simple business cost.

It is not the romantic cyberpunk ideal, but I think it can work quite effectively.  I also think it is unlikely to cost so much that it's outside of the realm of the enthusiast to run a node.  Gigabit connections are becoming relatively common and quite affordable for many, and they can easily accommodate quite large blocks without affecting regular use.  Fiber is coming to my area in three months and I plan to operate a full node when that happens."
"My theory is, that they have married LN to Segwit and LN is the end goal, for whatever reasons.  If they do a true blocksize increase, it will kill Segwit adoption, faster then is already happening.

They lied and said LN needed Segwit. They lied and said Segwit was a blocksize increase.  They lied and said hardforks were bad.  Is it not possible that if they hardfork a blocksize increase, fix malleability in the ways LN needs, without Segwit, and make an LN that does not require the financial fuckery they created with Segwit, that the people with their heads way far, far up their asses, might actually wake up to the shit show that is Bitcoin Core? 

I am not optimistic at this point, but I would think they would be starting to get concerned that they cannot keep pulling the wool over people's eyes.  So in their fear, they choose to stay the path and hope they can pull the final boondoggle before the sheep wake up."

You could achieve the exact same thing with a block size increase though. What solution does LN and segwit offer that raising the block size doesnt? What are the cons of raising the block size limit that LN and segwit doesnt have? Im failing to see the dangers to the technology high enough to warrant needing off chain solutions in the first place.

Good point lol
"> I'm not sure what point you're trying to make here.

The point is that the headline is wrong, from any perspective that's not extremely ideological.

Aside from the fact that there are many examples of radical & revolutionary changes that aren't accessible to the poor, there also typically tends to be an adoption curve in which revolutionary changes may not be accessible to the poor initially. Cars would be an obvious example of that."
Bitcoin should be easily accessible, but political measures sometimes restrict that as well.

"I see what you're saying and I agree to a point. But just to state one example:

Electric cars, in my opinion, are extremely revolutionary, as the impact they have on the environment are minimal, and the amount of natural resources that using these cars will preserve.

Yet the average price of these vehicles are well above the the national average.

I guess I could make a stupid example example saying a space shuttle.  Most people believe a space shuttle is revolutionary as to the discovery of things beyond our understanding.  Yet no normal person can afford one.  But this example is a little nonsense lol.

Edit: Now that i'm thinking about it, it's actual in interesting thing to consider revolutionary inventions and there impact on everyday life.  This is a way cool topic lol"
"> I think an excellent example of the point you were trying to make is the Saturn rocket program. It's clear that this program had long lasting effects on humanity even though it directly touched only a relative handful of people.

Saturn and the Moon landing weren't at all radical. We have been stuck in LEO since before then and after since it was way too damn expensive.

What SpaceX is doing to bring costs down through reuse, that's radical.

Suddenly new space investments are soaring. If you can imagine it, someone somewhere has a startup exploring it. From space mining, to Mars colonies investors are lining up just to see if it's possible. People are so sick of waiting for NASA ""Just take my money and get the fuck on with it."" has become market of it's own. Nobody is waiting for proof of profit, you either capitalize during the ""presale"" or forever hold your peace. All because of the drop in costs when you land a rocket like God and Robert Heinlein intended. Now we get to be a multi planetary species."
"Yes it was. Revolutionary means it started a movement toward a new production or new way of living. A current example is the Tesla Model S: a car that has fully autonomous capabilities and is fully electric. It is definitely revolutionary in it's design, but the price tag keeps it out of reach of most. That doesn't make it irrelevant. 

For a larger scale example, what about the nuclear powered submarines and aircraft carriers that can go for years without needing ""refueled""? That's completely inaccessible to the masses, but that doesn't mean it's not revolutionary.

There's also things like quantum computers which are vastly complicated and even more expensive. That not revolutionary? Buildings like the Burj Khalifa which are seemingly physics-defyingly tall which are built with clever new building practices? A rocket which can transport material into space and then re-land itself so it can be reused? 

Point is, I could go on and on listing revolutionary things that aren't accessible to most people. Hell, you're posted this on the bitcoin sub, and I guarantee you that most people in the world could not afford to purchase one full bitcoin. The idea that something has to be accessible to everyone to be revolutionary is just silly."
It was certainly revolutionary before it was made available to the masses.
But it was never made available to the poor and still isn't in most of the world.
"I'm sorry, was nuclear fusion not ""revolutionary""?  How about spaceflight?  Was that not ""radical""?

This is a stupid argument."

Holy crap this guy is an idiot
So it's not Ponzi-like because you can still buy restaurants (and lambos, I guess). Good argument, I can't fault that logic.
You can't have a store of wealth without utility.  See [Mises' Regression Theorem](https://wiki.mises.org/wiki/Regression_theorem).  This is why Bitcoin Legacy will never be a world wide global money.  Bitcoin Cash can fulfill the role though.  As for Matcalfe's Law, Bitcoin Legacy is shooting itself in the foot about that, and BCH is now benefitting more from it [as Rick Falkvinge says in this video](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7jzt2z/rick_falkvinge_on_btc_being_a_store_of_value/).  When you lock out over half the world's population and [claim Bitcoin is not for poor people](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6kri4j/reminder_blockstream_chief_strategy_officer/), then you are severely hindering the benefits from Metcalfe's Law.
"> That's not entirely accurate, even without the ability to transact there's still the store of wealth purpose (despite the fact it has large intraday swings some people might like it) 

Large intraday swings means it is not a store of value. In one month Bitcoin could lose 30% of it's value. This would be just another month for the currency. In the time it takes to close on a property Bitcoin could depreciate enough where the buyer can no longer afford the property. 

Bitcoin has the potential to be a store of value, but it has never been a store of value.  Anyone telling you it is is just selling snake oil. "

"Just an observation.

A Segway is also a potentially game changing technology as well.... When it arrived, many very smart people thought it would mean the death of the automobile.  And it contains technologies that will certainly be used in all kinds of future products.

But the Segway was not a game changer. The game remains the same.  No cities are being reenvisioned around the Segway.

It's easy to look back at the automobile and say ""well obviously it was super innovative"" but that's because you have the luxury of judging it after 100 years of success.  If you had lived 100 years ago in the country or in a congested European city you might have been very skeptical about this ""automobile"" that can't even step over a hole in the road which any horse can do."

The rich don't need a revolution. The poor are the ones who need change.
Supposedly, even twenty years ago USD/GDP pairs would be quoted with a difference of just one pip ($10 out of $100,000).  So even at the $1M scale the fee is fairly significant.
Bitcoin's original blocksize cap was 32mb so currently Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash are BTC clones with smaller blocks. Bitcoin Cash still retains the lowest fees of any of those coins you mentioned except maybe that premined corporate shitcoin Dash.

No. Nine out of ten war victims today are killed with assault rifles and small arms. Like yours. Those nuclear missiles, they're sitting in their silos. Your AK-47, that is the real weapon of mass destruction.  -- Agent Valentine in Lord of War

The microchip is radical, internet is radical, bitcoin is radical, the 3D printer is radical, the rifle is radical.

As far as weapons go, the nuke was not that radical. Many terrible weapons existed before the nuke that are just as bad if not worse, like weaponized disease.

Blankets were used to topple entire civilizations, and salt was used to keep them out for generations. So nukes aren't really all that radical since humans were more terrible than that to begin with and it took less effort. Nukes are crazy expensive for a reason, it takes a LOT of work to make one. It's not complexity that kills you it's the damn component costs.

Not saying nukes aren't scary. You would be an idiot to not be scared of them, but it's just something to put on the pile of existential problems along with ""hit by an asteroid"" and ""turned into a zombie by plague""."
i think honestly seriously they *don't* understand that they have no intellectual property here and they have to argue why their bitcoin is better... i think they really *don't understand it*
That's actual a very good point, and well said.
They didn't have time to have any. That does not mean they wouldn't have had any. Military use was a given, consumer adoption or no. There were plenty of roads before cars.

"Value is a subjective evaluation. 

Price is an objective one.

People often conflate price and value.

"It isn't just an argumentation point either.

Using blockchain technology to make conventional banking more robust (which is the aim of projects like BTC / Lightning, and Ripple) might be where the money is going, and it might even be a societal improvement, but it's not *revolutionary* unless it can ""change the game."" Giving blockchain to banks is like giving nukes to the top superpowers *who were going to dominate regardless.*

Making *onchain* transactions widely available is what ""changes the game."" Giving everyone an onchain transaction is like giving *everyone* a nuke.

We can agree the metaphor is sketchy but I think it makes the point nicely.  You can replace ""nuke"" with ""transportation device"" and get the same result - if internal combustion had only been a way to make diesel instead of steam locomotives, then it would have not been disruptive and transformational.  What made internal combustion transformational wasn't that it enabled more efficient forms of preexisting mass transportation, but that it enabled *personal* transportation. Similarly the invention of the computer was an innovation but it took *personal* computing for it to be a revolution.

Again my point isn't that things like the moon landing aren't important, because obviously they are, but they aren't particularly *revolutionary* until they affect the way normal people live.  And that typically implies mass availability.

Revolutionary implies societally altering.  In the context of crypto, that means onchain transactions for everyone.

"Ah.  Here I might agree with you.

A better headline would be ""if it's only accessible to the wealthy it's neither radical nor revolutionary.""

Even then I'm not sure I'd agree.... maybe ""if it's only accessible to the wealthy it cannot be revolutionary.""

That's probably what I'd say."
Political measures are not restricting bitcoin anywhere near what they could be. Aside from currency complications in China, I can't think of anywhere that politics is the obstacle for blockchain-based currency being acessible to the impoverished. Mobile banking is already huge in Africa and in India the government has made a massive push to give access to traditional banking to all citizens. The anonymity provided by blockchain technology is quite useful for money laundering and the black market, but cannot beat cash on a local level, so again, nothing going for the world's impoverished masses.
Playing semantics, uh?
"Some guy, about two thousand years ago, changed the world forever, by just speaking about peace, forgiveness and what he truly believed.
Today, billions follow their teachings.

That's radical. "
"Allow me to play devil's advocate.

So far it appears to be that generally speaking the world order in the post nuclear age is roughly the same players that were going to emerge post WW2 regardless.

Since WW2 no nuke has ever been used and apart from a few outlier events most wars go on pretty much as if there are no nuclear weapons available.

I think we can all agree that nuclear weapons are quite destructive and important and that they have effected some significant degree of change in the world.  But I also posit that, had such devices never been created, life today would very likely look almost exactly the same for almost every human on Earth.  Which doesn't make them particularly revolutionary in my book.

YMMV.

Edit: I'll add that again it's the distribution of the things that makes the difference. Give every nation (much less every person) a nuke, now you can say nukes are revolutionary, because that really would change the world order."

"> Electric cars, in my opinion, are extremely revolutionary, as the impact they have on the environment are minimal, and the amount of natural resources that using these cars will preserve.

Right, but unless people generally can afford to use them, then they can't effect a ""revolution"" can they?  As long as the 99% of schmos like us keep driving on dead dinosaurs, the planet still goes to shit, right?

Remember that wealth is concentrated 99/1%.  Really more like 99.8/0.2%.  That means there's this class of wealthy people then there's everyone else.  Globally, the median *annual* income per capita is ~$3000.  Probably [most people you've ever met is in the global top 1 or 2%](https://www.diygenius.com/the-global-inequality-problem/).   If your product can't affect meaningful change for the other 99%, then I'll state it just can't be considered ""revolutionary.""

Telephones?  Weren't a societal revolution until widely distributed.  Same for cars.  Same for computers.  Same for clean drinking water.  Same for airplanes.  Same for refrigeration.  Same for vaccines.  Same for the internet....

**....same for onchain transactions.**"

"> Revolutionary means it started

No it doesn't or the answer would always be ""the big bang"" and nothing else.

It wasn't the car that revolutionized individual transportation it was the industrial revolution... the enlightenment... soap... farming... frontal lobes... thumbs... evolution... the big bang.

When something is just invented you say it ""represents a revolution"" because the revolution hasn't actually happened yet even if you know it's inevitable. Revolution is a process not a moment.

> Hell, you're posted this on the bitcoin sub, and I guarantee you that most people in the world could not afford to purchase one full bitcoin.

you think? what impact did they have before they were available to the working man? It wasn't till people owned them that roads were built for them, or cities designed for them.

"Not just""inaccessible to the poor,"" but also ""targeting the stupid."" Even if you're not poor, $15-$30 fees make it uneconomical for even the rich to use the coin for purchases less than $300.

A better analogy would be the automobile, which wasn't really revolutionary until it was made available to the masses. 
It basically is and it makes the cash fanboys look like kindergarden kids or gossip girls 
No, sorry... 
I don't believe you are seeing my point.
"Kaamen's vision was Segways in urban centers and mass transit for longer distances making the automobile much less important if not obsolete. The theory was that Segways would penetrate in already highly congested cities (with existing rail lines and existing restrictions on cars) and in new planned developments that could be organized around these devices. Kamen had done studies and built mock-ups of his ideas for Segway cities.

Regardless the point stands. Can a technology affect significant change without being widely adopted? Yes. However, mass adoption is a **tremendous** amplifier of a technology's impact on humanity. We tend to think of things as revolutionary when they change the way everyday life is lived, and that implies mass adoption."
ok great what alts are your favorites to use? what have you bought with an alt lately? and why do you think those alts are better than Bitcoin Cash, the original Bitcoin?
Except not, because bch is still real bitcoin....
"Consider that the average person in America makes ~$35K which puts them in the global top 1% of earners.

99% of the rest of the world earns less than the average American."
Okay. 
"I think you disagree on what it means to be revolutionary.

I tend to side with OP: the things that are considered revolutionary are the things that transform the way normal people live their lives.  By my definition, it's quite difficult for a technology to change how people live if they cannot use it."
"You said the automobile was revolutionary *before* it was made available to the masses. I'm pointing out that the revolution it caused was a direct result of *mass adoption.*  Had the automobile been adopted similarly to the Segwit, then like the Segwit it likely would not be regarded as being particularly important in hindsight, regardless of the advances in engineering it might have later spawned. We attribute the automobile's ""revolutionary"" status to the fact that it caused a fairly complete rethinking of society, due entirely to the fact that it was made available to the masses.

In fact, the technology of mass production itself was much more disruptive than either the automobile or space travel, and that is quite literally because mass production enabled mass adoption."
But your argument is not printed on a wall so it cannot be an absolute undisputable truth. /s
flying to the moon not the best example.. 50 years later.. it's a pretty slow revolution
"Yes, but we're taking about MONEY not just some abstract innovation with no context.

If we accept as given that the world's wealth is already distributed roughly 99% to the top 1%, then it stands to reason that innovations in the field of ""money"" that simply further empower the 1% cannot be expected to be particularly ""disruptive"" or ""innovative"" as they cannot significant change the preexisting operative paradigm.  Something that CAN change the preexisting operative paradigm would be far more disruptive.

Because the world's wealth is already very very poorly distributed, we should expect real innovation in this space to be innovation that empowers the billions of disempowered not currently served.

I think an excellent example of the point you were trying to make is the Saturn rocket program. It's clear that this program had long lasting effects on humanity even though it directly touched only a relative handful of people.

That said, I'm sure you'll agree that, while landing humans on the moon was a milestone event for humanity, you'll never hear anyone really justify the program on the basis of beating the Russians onto an uninhabitable rock. Instead you'll hear about all the many many ways that the innovations required to achieve a moon landing **eventually trickled their way down to the common person.** Like the way Honda's participation in F1 racing led to it bringing race suspension technology to passenger cars.

TL;DR innovations are made more ""disruptive"" and societally impactful by their utility to common people.

and even a majority of those who do. As a techy knowledgable 20something, the cumbersome nature of crypto exchanges is sometimes so dense I'm unable to achieve simple goals like a fucking transfer. If I am often impeded and discouraged, what's a person who's scarcely interacted with a computer to do?
but the technology is not bitcoin. It's just the first and most known (for now) use case. It's the blockchain which is the technology to disrupt. And hopefully, will be accessible also to poorer citizens. For that we need good interfaces.

"BTC is useless ever since LTC and ETH got reliable fiat pairings. I'm deep into alts and don't even hold LTC or ETH anyway, but anytime I'm buying or selling it's always in one of the two.

I guess BTC can be useful for on-exchange trades but even that is pure legacy and is losing ground to ETH and LTC as well. 

Anywhere you see info or guides about how to start trading and using an exchange you'll always see warnings about BTC being slow and the fees too high and recommending people buy in via LTC or ETH. 

To be honest it's actually surprising that BTC is still holding a value and I can only imagine it's mostly people that just don't have a clue. 

Personally I'm thinking XRB will eventually replace any purely currency coin and things like ETH will of course exist for its amazing token and smart contract platform, but beyond that there's a chance we'll start seeing a pruning of many alts since so many are just pointless forks whether or not they're scams or have quality teams. Like for example XMY and VTC have always been coins I've held and loved the communities attached to them. I just don't see a single point in their existence in a post XRB world though. Also, mining is something we should seek to move away from. Traditional PoW coins just take too much damn resources."
"That's not entirely accurate, even without the ability to transact there's still the store of wealth purpose (despite the fact it has large intraday swings some people might like it) intact and the ability to transact remains intact for big purchases like a house (I helped a guy buy a restaurant in BTC in December). 

So the network is still worth what Metcalf's law says it is based on these usages and the BTC network is larger than the BTH network. Just facts.

While the boat-building infrastructure has some jobs, the only way this helps people is through ""trickle-down"". ""Trickle-down"" is proven not to benefit most people in an economy where the workforce has no bargaining power due to increasing automation.

* Driving up the price of stocks makes it *harder* for smart money to do its job through investment. When tremendous amounts of money are competing for some place to generate a return, this distorts the economy in ways that are hard to measure, but are probably not helpful. It makes the financial sector super powerful, and incentivizes events like the subprime crisis."
"I'm not against fractional reserve banking, just hyper risky death banking, like they did in the lead up to the great recession. I mean, if a 30 year fixed mortgage sold to someone with solid credit is an aspirin, then selling a Interest only adjustable rate mortgage to someone on a fixed income that can't cover the rate it will adjust to in 1-5 years is like running an Opium den. They both might cure what ails you, but the risks are worlds apart. Another hope of crypto is that if the money is all crypto and mathematically accounted for, then the Evil Bankers of the Fed can't just digitally print 4 trillion more and give it to their friends, as we discovered happened during the 2008 meltdown.

As to the non-fractional bank, such things do exist, in the vaults that store gold for people. You pay an annual fee, and they only hodl your physical metals for you. Its kinda dumb, but you could do it, and many gold bugs do. I'm looking for a sensible middle ground, where money is lent out, but not just to generate fees and resell turds on the market. If one bank failing means they will all fail in short order, as they did in 2008, then that is a bad system, and they need to be regulated in such a way that they can still lend, but won't all crumple like a house of cards next time."
I see you believe in investing about as much as I believe in central banking... Even if Index investing is just pumping up stock prices, it DOES put your fiat directly into the hands of someone else, who is probably more likely to spend it, so in a sense, it IS giving your money to someone else, except you receive stocks in return for it, so this type of investing should be mostly harmless, in your worldview, since it is immediately stimulating.
Also just to add the Ledger did not allow me to change the Seed words, only to change and set the Pin.
Yes but with all due respect the seed card in the Ledger package look legit and very professional. It has also come to my attention that you were informed about this scam 2 weeks ago from someone that purchased from the same seller I got my Ledger from and you did nothing at all about it, no mention of it anyway (facebook/twitter/reddit etc),  if you had there is a chance I would have seen it and removed more coins from the Ledger before they were stolen. Still you have not put anything up to inform others. Ledger has some sort of responsibility for what has happened. I highly recommend you have someone from Ledger contact me very soon.

"> what would you call the national governments owning vast reserves of gold.

That type of national ""saving"" is only worth anything if you plan to buy from other countries when things get dire. This can only really work if you expect other countries to be economically healthy, and want to buy gold from you, when shit hits the fan in your country. If you're the world's largest economy like the US, such a situation is unlikely.

> you need growth, which you get from prudent investing, which are not dead assets, it IS investing in infrastructure

Investment is a risky activity that needs to be done by people who have educated opinions about what the economy needs, and who will back those opinions with money. True prudent investing is, by necessity, a specialist niche.

For the average Joe, or for the nation at large, the only type of prudent investing that can be done is to not invest at all. Just give the money to people so they'll spend it. This drives demand. Supply in itself is not sufficient.

Failing that, if you're insisting that the nation must ""invest"", then if you're lucky, people will invest in index funds (drives up stock prices) or treasury bonds (which funds government spending and raises demand &ndash; why, again, not just give money to people?). If you're not so lucky, the money goes into sub-prime mortgages, and kaboom.

When a nation tries to ""invest"", this just creates bubbles and distorts the economy, because it's all dumb money. If you're lucky, it's a relatively harmless, persistent, long-term bubble that drives up the price of stock or treasuries."
It now looks like this could have been prevented. I received a message today from someone who informed Ledger 2 weeks ago about this scam and you chose to do nothing, no mention of it anywhere (facebook/twitter/reddit or your website). If you posted the scam information 2 weeks ago there is a good chance I would have seen it and moved my coins out of my Ledger. You need to take some responsibility for this, and I still have not received a email from you.
It's Sunday. Their counsel/other employees are not paying attention to emails. Give it a day or two before turning on someone that promised help. This is all over the news now, they're not going to back out. 
"Dude... you have no one to blame but yourself.
You carried out zero due diligence.
If you're putting 25 grands worth of Crypto on a ledger, one would assume that you would want to familiarize yourself with the process and learn exactly how they work.
Take it on the chin and move on.
Your coins are gone and you only have yourself to blame.
"
I have a wireless printer, but moved. I don't know how to re-sync the wireless printer to the new network without a USB cord.
I'm amazed that you still have no concept of how a Ledger works. 
"I'll just put my Bitcoin on this used device... and it's gone! 

Buy new."
Society can save, what would you call the national governments owning vast reserves of gold. That is a dead asset, pretty much the same as stuffing your mattress with money. But that won't work for a retirement plan, you need growth, which you get from prudent investing, which are not dead assets, it IS investing in infrastructure, and producing goods and services, and society could do this without ill effects, there just has never been the political will to try, and there may never be.
Well, those would be helpful! Lol, thank you!
"When you arrived on ledgerwallet.com/apps (as pointed by the fake doc) you had to see a warning regarding the fact that seeds should always be generated by yourself.

You will be contacted by our GC shortly (he is right now away). Thank you for your patience."
A little video series on how to effectively use and understand a ledger would be wonderful! I am thinking of getting one (been using paper wallets and desktop/phone client) and would love informative videos directly from the makers.
">Yes but with all due respect the seed card in the Ledger package look legit and very professional

no it doesn't"
It doesn’t matter that the transaction could take 3 weeks to go through?
There's a less dickish way to say that, buddy.  I made a spelling mistake.  Just correct me without being an autistic prick about it.
"> Your ledger app can be a knock-off. Your entire device could be a knock-off. Your shipment could be a knock-off.

Then you won't be able to fund it and you won't lose any money. If the device is a knock-off how will you put funds on it? "
"It's about limiting your exposure. No matter the wallet you'll want a physical backup of the key. How much more exposure you add on from there is what you can change. Best is to use a seed + custom word password so even if a thief gets your physical seed list they'd still need to crack a password, making it nigh impossible.

Falling for a scam is always going to be the #1 method when it comes to losing money, crypto or fiat. A big barrier I have with crypto is how easy it is to scam or hack, and how hard it is for anyone to have any recourse. If someone stole $25k from a bank account, there's many avenues to recover it. If someone hacks $25k of Bitcoin from someone's computer, well that's $25k gone.

Imagine an elderly person trying to secure their Bitcoin. It's impossible."
stupid motherfucker YOU CAN ONLY PURCHASE LEDGERS FROM LEDGER. RESELLER? THERE ARE NONE PUTS. GROW A BRAIN. PLEASE. ITS PEOPLE LIKE YOU THAT ARE SO FUCKING WEAK THAT YOU SCARE NORMIES OUT OF INVESTING BECAUSE YOU LIVE IN FUCKING LA-LA-LAND. NO OFFENSE YOU DESERVED YOUR LOSS. 
Yep. I used to work in retail, had access to a shrink wrapper. We'd shrink wrap all sorts of things for shits and giggles.
I'm not talking about £60. I'm talking about online identity, ip addresses, PayPal accounts, bank accounts etc etc. Maybe this is a highly organised outfit and they haven't left a trace, but i doubt it.
"You do not understand how Blockchain works on a very basic level.

Yes you will be able to fund a knock-off Ledger. Yes it will work, you can send and receive. And no, it will not be secured. A third party can guarantee that it is stolen.

And you don't strike me as the kind of person who wants to learn something new right now. You strike me as the kind of person who wants to double down and argue something they don't know anything about.

They can easily sell you a working knock-off Ledger Wallet that has a valid private key known to the third party. It's trivial to create a minimally functional wallet that can send and receive money. There is no need for segwit. There is no need to create new private keys or actually use a key corresponding to a seed. You just have a fake device that shows fake pixels.

The knock-off does not need far more functionality than what you know a paper wallet (a piece of paper) has.

A new user won't even know how the Ledger is supposed to work. They could not distinguish the app from a forked CoPay.

You are overestimating everyone (including yourself). Yes, a majority of people would have their tingling sensors at maximum as soon as something fishy were to happen (like scratching off the seed in the last eBay scam). But a non-negligible portion wouldn't.

For fuck's sake, please stop arguing shit you know absolutely nothing about. And stop looking for holes to be able to say ""Nah but what you said there is wrong I am dismissing your argument I won this debate"". You are giving security advice online. **Don't**.

Let the Ledger people speak. If they want to advertize ""Our device is safe enough even if you buy it off AliExpress or dhgate!"" then they should. But they are not as stupid as you are."
"Very true... there are probably countless ways to fake all of this if you don't Ledger's software or their hardware, but then the onus is on the user at that level.

The point was that if you try to use Ledger's software from Ledger's website, a fake wouldn't work at all.  There's only so much that Ledger themselves can do and if anything they've gone above and beyond to make it relatively foolproof.  You can't judge them if you're not using their stuff at all."
That really sucks man. I hope that's only a minority of your stash. I have like 0.05btc locked up from 2014 that's annoying me.
"> They're all secure from a hardware standpoint... (...) Anyone buying from a third party can avoid this scam and still use the device if they reset the hardware wallet and create new keys from scratch that only they have. 

That is just dangerous and bad advice.

You are making a very general statement. You are assuming that 100% of the people could not be fished and you could not be more wrong.

It does not matter one bit how good a job they do. Almost nothing is ever 100% secure."
Honestly, I think it's a pretty elegant scam. The entire setup is not exactly familiar to people, and a scratchy card doesn't seem implausible at all. OP got conned, but I certainly wouldn't judge them for it in the way you are.
Fair enough if you don’t trust the technical capabilities of the EAL 5+ security chip and the impossibility of defeating it with due diligence (which is the users responsibility).  But then at that level nothing is secure and you wouldn’t use any wallet because you can’t get much more secure. So by your argument, might as well not get into any crypto at all because nothing is secure enough.  What would you use and do then? What’s your safe advice for security? Have you investigated any other potential solutions that are better?
"Jesus christ, I am surrounded by retards who think they are Sherlock Holmes.

> if you don’t trust the technical capabilities of the EAL 5+ security chip and the impossibility of defeating it with due diligence 

No. You misunderstood everything. I do fully trust the chip installed in a proper Ledger Wallet.

Again:

Your Ledger can be a knock off **that does not even have the chip installed**. And it can still work if someone creates their own **Ledger Wallet App** and includes it in a CD or phised website.

For fuck's sake, this is the third time I try to explain this to you and you keep responding in ways that make absolutely no sense. And then the rest of your response makes no sense.

You are a retard and lack the required reading comprehension here.

Go ahead educating others, thinking you are invincible. It's a quick way to slip and slide.

> What would you use and do then? What’s your safe advice for security?

**DO NOT FUCKING ORDER THE LEDGER FROM A THIRD PARTY AS THAT INTRODUCES ANOTHER ELEMENT OF TRUST**. Do not try to argue with me with your lack of reading comprehension. You are not super smart. You are not seeing the entire picture. You can be wrong.

Just. Don't. Order. From. A. Third. Party.

Especially not eBay or Amazon. Order from Ledger.

I don't know how I can make it any more clearer to someone as dense as you. This is literally the third time you misunderstand my comment and then decide to argue with me. Fuck off."
Someone that manufactured a knock off device can direct you to any web wallet. It does not even have to be functional software.
of the hacked or unverified info. all btc related ebay stuff is a scam.
"they will get this guy ASAP. Lol he's problaby posting. IDK how many people could honestly ask ""what crime did he commit?"" when were talking theft over 20k over the internet. He's cooked like a goose. What goes around, comes around."
Ah, that's awesome!
Are you braindead? Do you think if the seller did it he would tell you? What planet are you on that you think everyone is always telling you the truth? WHO THE FUCK WOULD THE SELLER ORDER THEM FROM BESIDES LEDGER? Think... How could that even be close to possible? You are insane bro and it's weak people like yourself that get hurt in this type of ordeal-- we had another putz on here last week who lost all his crypto and last I checked the friends (who were also crypto savy) who he got hammered with and left his phone at there place... he is so fucking braindead that he literally can't put 2 and 2 together. Just think... if your a scammer and a victim messages you on eBay... would you say you did it? No. Moron. Grow up and tell the seller the police will be knocking on his door if he does not return the funds. There is only one seller of Ledger's and that's Ledger. No once can go fucking order them from somewhere else BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ONLY ONES WHO PRODUCE/SELL THEM. THERE ARE NO RESELLERS/DROPSHIPPERS FOR LEDGER'S DUDE GROW A FUCKING BRAINSTEM AND USE IT. YOU ARE A WEAK FISH IN THIS WORLD AND FISH ONLY KNOW HOW TO SWIM.
doesn't matter. paypal will not cover crypto at all.
You asked how did they receive the money. What are you talking about if not the PayPal money from eBay?
">No need to be mean.

Sure let's just let them do it again.

There is certainly a need to be straightforward about this. It looks like the OP was an absolutely clueless newbie and at the time of my writing, nobody here had the decency to tell them.

How would you have explained this to the OP without being mean? ""I think you've made the most basic mistake with your cryptocurrency, under no circumstances should you ever have expected a shred of security. You do not understand literally the first thing about crypto.""

If you think I was being snarky, the OP's mistake was so baffling to me that I really wasn't sure I understood the situation correctly."
"Thanks so much for your support and kind words. 
Just to let you know it has now been confirmed that the ebay seller purchase the Ledgers cheap from a seller on Gumtree."
Holy shit.  Lack of reading comprehension? Did you even read my first comments here? There’s more agreement in those statements than you’re giving credit for.  For the most part wasn’t even arguing your final point here.  I agree that ordering from Ledger is best. I was just highlighting the fact that with a valid device and scammed key scheme as in OP,  it would be viable to verify the Wallet and reset it. Nothing in that statement argues against your points.  You need some coffee man. 
"You would also have to trust that tool to not create a cache and upload the private seed after your computer goes online. Things like that are beyond the laymen. Just don't be lazy and use tools.

If you must use a tool, then make your own private seed generator, use different sessions, and randomize those sessions. Hell, I think it'd be better to just use a RNG (evennif it's somebody else's) and paper dictionary.

If you think this is overly cautious, and you're willing to lose 5 to 7 figures over laziness, then you deserve it."
Feel free to answer my question instead of accusing me I'm being judgy.
"Of course they can. It’s like $5 for a stolen eBay account on any of the dark web markets. That’s already someone else’s info hooked up to someone else’s paypal.
The hardest part of this scam is actually convincing someone to trust the compromised hardware. But once they do trust it, it’s easy.
Monitor the wallet address on something like bitref until it has a large amount of crypto transferred to it. Then use the seed to generate the private key and get access, transfer all the crypto as quick as possible to a newly created wallet, then put it through a couple of tumblers so it can’t be directly tracked to your end wallet.
"
"I don't know much about U.K. laws. Are cryoptocurrencies even regulated to that point in the U.K.? As it stands in most countries, it's a digital currency that gets treated like GTA money.

I know people here in the U.S. that have been scammed out of their BTC. The FBI gave zero shits."
"He broke plenty of Federal Laws that require a mandatory minimum of 15 years in Federal Prison (USA). Grand theft over >10,20>,>30 dollars, Grand theft over the internet, Fraud, Tampering with computer equipement (they will charge this despite the fact it was just a scratch off card.), and Hacking. Go look what happened to the Secret Service agents that made off with a ton of BTC that was stolen. EVERYTHING IS PUBLIC BROTHER AND YA GOTTA CASH OUT SOMEWHERE ;) The feds will get whoever did this and it will be a news article in the near future."
"Receive the money for the ledgers? They don’t- that’s a write off. Selling the ledgers is just so the people who buy them trust the compromised hardware. The “gain” comes from the fact that eventually, someone will use the compromised ledger and transfer a large sum of crypto in to the compromised wallet that the scammer can then steal.
In this case, it was ~£100 investment for the ledger and scam materials, which netted them £24,900. Even if they spent £5k and bough 50 ledgers to compromise and sell, if only this specific user fell for the scam, they still made £20,000.
The scammer would be incredibly stupid to risk everything just to also claim the £60 from PayPal."
I know, why would they? They will have a name and address
That's cool of them.
lol, you are confused.   Someone bought up the supply and is reselling it to ebay sellers.  Scammers wouldn't sell on ebay directly, they would list on some chinese site normally used by shitty ebay resellers.
"My advice is never do something you do not understand in crypto world. Please read about it and understand clearly what you are getting into. If you had understood how this wallet thing works, you would never use a seed given to you. This is very early stage in crypto land, one of the weak link is identity(securing private keys), which probably will be solved down the line, but for now you must understand the very basics at least, if you are putting even a dollar into it.

Best option you have is to report as stolen, contact ebay that you are scammed, with evidence. Seller sending a seed with the device is clear evidence enough of a crime. You may be lucky if seller resides in your country. You may even hire a good lawyer for few hundred bucks.

Good luck"

> The ledger apps do a firmware check

to

> I have seen retards defend this because of the firmware chip, etc. But what if it's just a fake device that pretends to be authentic.

Your ledger app can be a knock-off. Your entire device could be a knock-off. Your shipment could be a knock-off."
OP made a mistake, and a pretty reasonable one under the circumstances. No need to be mean.
"The ledger apps do a firmware check to make sure the device has not been tampered with.

https://www.ledger.fr/2015/03/27/how-to-protect-hardware-wallets-against-tampering/

Read this blog. The wallet software checks your device every time to verify it hasn't been tampered with. If what you are saying has been done it won't work with the wallet software ledger provides.

>There is absolutely no way that an attacker could replace the firmware and make it pass attestation, without knowing the Ledger private key.
"
Of course you could. It can have a functioning receive mechanism, without knowing any private keys required to send funds.
Dumbass there are no reseller/dropshippers for Ledger's because they are the only ones that produce/sell them. Moron. Shut up the seller WAS THE SCAMMER.

[deleted]
ah this is perhaps a bit of a stretch. not everything bought on there relies on stolen credit cards. 
"Their business model relies on credit card thieves. Thieves need to convert stolen credit card numbers into cash fast, before the theft is discovered. And Bitcoin is a nice, anonymous intermediary.

And how do you buy Bitcoin with stolen credit cards? You just have to buy people's stuff on Amazon in exchange for Bitcoins slightly above market rate (which thieves don't care about, since it's all stolen money anyway)."
No, we're going to destroy banks by not using banks.
"Hmm, sounds a bit like you have some XRP though and are trying to defend it. Nothing wrong with that, but running away from the 100billion pre-allocated issue isn't the way to go. Instead let people know why that was done and how XRP will be used so that it retains or increases in value. So talk about that business model to people.

I don't have much against Ripple/XRP but it they are pretty unusual. And XRP valuation deserves some discussion as does any coin in top 50 (at least).

"
Honestly doubt they care about that list. They're a business, in it to make money. Once their servers have been upgraded and stabilised, we'll see what CC's they add.
"upcoin.com/?ID=df75fa6f 

free free free 500$ in crypto when you do a simple survey"
Coinbase won't add it, _because it's not a real cryptocurrency_, period. They have their Digital Asset Framework for coins they add. If it doesn't meet that then it doesn't get added. You can see Ripple doesn't even meet half the criteria if you go down the list. 
None right now, literally zero big players are actually relying on crypto on a regular basis so every single coin is speculative
I said before XRP isn't something I'm heavily invested in. IF you don't want to buy XRP because you think the use cases just aren't there yet, then don't. But that doesn't make it a scam. Ripple could still keep going up by a lot, too. Just ask the people on /r/ripple, they're bullish.
"The list explains their philosophy about cryptocurrencies and which ones they will support in future. It's a serious process for their due diligence. Otherwise they'd have never ending work adding shitcoins and scam coins left right and center for years to come. They're a respectable business and they can't be seen to be supporting garbage.

Now, Ripple (XRP) is a centralised garbage banker coin which was 100% premined and has trilions of coins in circulation. You can't even use it as a regular currency anywhere. It's just a tool for speculation."
Whatever helps you sleep at night bud.
Great work everyone!

Good Bot
Thanks for your hard work
Awesome! Open and genuine discourse will always be the best thing for everyone.
Thanks!
BCH : BTC ratio up. r/BTC : r/Bitcoin ratio up. I've gt a good feeling about this!
**This** is the exponential growth we want. Adoption.
Congratulations to all, new and old
Amazing! It's cool to see the community grow!
YESSSS
NEWS: /r/bitcoin shits on 150,065  reddit users who believe in the real way bitcoin was intended
Congrats everyone. Free speech is popular.  Nobody wants an /r/bitcoin censored forum in order to talk about a technology that is built around being censorship resistant.  Only sheep would want that. /u/tippr gild
"excellent! 

 BCH tips through u/tippr for anyone who posts! "
I'd like to thank all the little people for making this achievement possible. lol
Usually don't use subscriptions on reddit, but I'm now subbed here to help raise that number. Let's get to 200K.
The internet treats censorship as a fault and routes around it.
this is one of the only reddits i've actually promoted to the outside world in years, i really think it'd be great if everyone rushed here to have a big party, like the more people we get here the more it'll work, it's super important, even though reddit isn't as important in general these days it's still central psychologically in crypto, so i really think we can make a change by converging here :)

"This community wouldn't be so great without its openness and its team of mods dedicated to to the idea of honest currency.

;)"
Just a reminder to always be polite and respectful to all our new visitors. /r/btc is a reddit for the UNCENSORED discussion of bitcoin, and does not have a stated preference for any particular fork. We exist as on OPEN forum to discuss bitcoin. If you have a problem with the censorship on /r/bitcoin, even if you choose to read it, please consider unsubscribing. Every sub is an implicit endorsement of the moderators and their practice of censorship and suppressing open discussion. Regardless of what you think about bitcoin or bitcoin cash, any idea with merit deserves and should be able to withstand free and open debate.
Let's open the 'champaign^^TM' everyone! :D
"Thanks to the good moderators we have here to keep speech free.

/u/tippr $10"
And thank you for the great moderation. Onwards and upwards... 
This is absolutely fantastic. I only recently joined the bitcoin cash community and there is so much passion for creating a truly new form of wealth.
Wait! I thought we were celebrating 100k like just a month ago? YUUUUUGE!
Dang, if I'd noticed I would have unsubscribed so I could subscribe again and be Mr 150000
(☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞
"I can't believe less than 4 months ago I was so blinded by rbitcoin. I was even one of the astroturfers on r/bcash when the fork happened. I'm glad I saw the light early on. Thanks to rbitcoin banning me for asking difficult questions.

I use Bitcoin Cash regularly now and have been spreading it to all my friends and family members. Feels great to be part of the revolution."
"I know this is late and I didn't downvote it, but I reject the premise of point 1. This thread is a historically important one, so I think it is worth adding some perspective.

Do we know that increasing the block size limit will make it harder to run a full node? 

1. BCH's average block size is currently smaller than BTCs. 
2. BTC's full mempool increases the resources needed to run a full node.
3. Moore's law may actually make it cheaper to run full nodes even if the average block size increases.

I get the argument that removing or increasing the block size limit *may* cause centralization, but no one has yet convinced me that keeping it is not also causing centralization. "
"I think that's a slight misreading. With every misstep, more followers see the light and fewer remain. There is a very vocal/radical core (pardon the pun) and it seems those on the edge tend to embody ""the lady doth protest too much""."
Awesome.  Sechet deserves it.
I would like to donate a couple of Bitcoin Cash coins to BCH developers (appx $5,000).  I am new to this site.  Can someone let me know how I can do this? Thanks.
This is why I'm totally committed to BCH, seeing the generosity from this community has been amazing. Just waiting on that tax refund, then I'm going all in!
there are multiple teams developing for BCH and that is one of them. Amaury Sechet has the most commits on Bitcoin abc, you can just send him a tipper tip here https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7okvh7/udeadalnix_appreciation_post_since_aug_1_fork_he/dsaw9gk/
u/deadalnix can you please let him know how to donate to Bitcoin ABC project?
I can donate it on Bitcoin Unlimited pagehttps://www.bitcoinunlimited.info/donate.  Is this the best route?
