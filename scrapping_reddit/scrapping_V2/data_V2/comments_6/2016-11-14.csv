This is nothing less than the single greatest document of /r/btc's *raison d'etre* that has ever been published. I move that this be stickied somehow.
"I'm saying Trump spent a fraction of what other republicans spent on advertising to win the primaries and a fraction of what Hillary spent to win the presidency and negatve PR had a large role in this.

Thanks I sent you an email with a little more info. ^ the ad (http://coinad.com/?a=Ad&b=IGX2J4DJIRF45) has ran out now - 1million impressions in around 4 hours. It received 660+ clicks, so realistically it could be 1-2k clicks daily - a variety/rolling/changing set of banners to r/btc / articles / bitcoin.com , other info and causes.
Can we republish your post on news.bitcoin.com?  (Giving you full credit of course!)
We'll move on when resources such as these have the effect of ousting the censors and bad actors, or when it's clear users have abandoned the controlled spaces. Until then, it's still front page news.
"Lol, typical small blockhead: ""now that you know I'm stealing from you, can we just move on please?"" "
Sadly no. The toxic debates go back for years. :(
Anything that makes XT an altcoin likewise makes Core an altcoin, unless you are going by popularity - but no, your standard is contention. In every scenario where XT has enough support to be controversial, Core by definition has enough non-support to be controversial. The market will choose to hard fork away from any soft-fork change that it seriously has a problem with, so your autistic focus on the technical aspects is pointless.
The massive externalized costs of implementing Segregated Witness far outweigh the cost of performing a hard fork — and all of this for a mere 0.7MB “effective” increase in block size. Let’s not forget that Bitcoin Core’s insistence on SegWit was intended as a measure to avoid using a hard fork to increase the transaction capacity of the bitcoin network. SegWit activation will enable Bitcoin Core to keep refusing an actual block size increase and bitcoin’s death march will continue.

"The ""private property exception"" as used by theymos is so stupid.

/R/bitcoin is the private property of Reddit, not theymos. /R/bitcoin is not his house, his castle: it's a public forum used by many. What do you call a king who demands he can control the lives of his subjects? A tyrant."
"Which actions you decide to take using your private property or otherwise define who you are.

The fact that you use this exemption or say that you are a libertarian does not make you one.

bitcointalk is also controlled and censored by theymos. use forum.bitcoin.com or /r/btc
"The analysis bashco ran, it showed that I myself was downvoted over 1000 times by bots. Many people were impacted, both to manipulate votes up and down.

Death threats and enemies lists, those were posted here on various occasions, I reported those to the mods here directly, nothing was done and reports were very deliberately ignored, I was personally targeted with threats and put on these lists.

/u/memorydealers is someone who attacks others through public shaming and bullying. He once abused his admin privilege on blockchaininfo wallet to use their private wallet data to start publicly doxxing someone.

"Nice ad!

Allow me to make one suggestion also:

It might be more effective if the ad were to prominently display r/btc.

In other words, we should not be giving free publicity only to r\bitcoin (the *bad* thing).

We should also be giving publicity to r/btc (the *good* thing).

Thanks, Roger, I'm honored. But I'm writing to share a message, I don't want any tips for that.
I may be a Blocke, but I'm no blockhead.

"Exactly! How the hell is raising the limit an ""altcoin"" when SW plans on totally changing the structure of payments? The best solutions in computer science are the simplest. This is so ass backwards. Remember when bitcoin was ruled by public interest?"
I can read your posts just fine here. 
"The thing that makes XT an altcoin is that it required a contentious hard fork.

Soft forks like segwit don't result in an altcoin because they are backward-compatible with existing nodes.

Theymos is a hardcore libertarian, just using the private property exemption.

"I am stealing from you? Please explain.

Its not that I don't care about the censorship, its just that it seems there isn't much that can be done, as the powers that be decide it is justifiable behaviour. They own the sub, so its their rules.

I am not going to spend all my time in bitcoin worrying about it, as bitcoin itself is bigger than censorship, I am sure you agree, but if you need me to fit some pre conceived generalisation of a small blocker, than go for it, but you are lesser person for it, sadly. "

At least with bitusher I was having a civilized discussion. Jesus!
"unfortunately they enforce rules that justify censorship. (I'm glad they are not under centralized control.)

I'm not opposed to theymos, I'm opposed to centralized control, and in addition I'm opposed to censorship. "
This is not about the Internet but about bitcoin and billions of dollars involved. Plus, iirc, the NK only came about because originally if you tried to post r/Bitcoin, your post got moderated. It's use has stuck. 
This is about ideals being trampled.
Hiding opinions you dislike you say? Good thing that never ever happens on rbtc /s
Ver has paid for reddit advertising multiple times and their is always cross posts between forums and users participating in both subs. When a new user clicks on the profile of me or one of many users they will also quickly find r/btc and investigate it. 
"Roger has run ads multiple times and owns a very recognizable site - bitcoin.com , thus it shouldn't be hard for him to attract attention. Additionally, there are cross posts all the time on r/bitcoin. I see a top comment on the first page even today linking directly to r/btc ... https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/5cxj1d/just_daily_roger_ver_hypocrisy_constantly/

This happens all the time as well. It is delusional to think that most regular r/bitcoin users aren't aware of this subreddit. 
"
"Snapshot right now.
151 users here now - r/btc 
446 users here now - r/bitcoin

There usually is around 3x amount of active users regardless what day or time you check. There is also always cross posts ... and one on the homepage right now of r/bitcoin leading back to r/btc as we speak.

"
I've never seen any of these ads despite viewing /r/Bitcoin every day or so. And it is patently ridiculous to claim a few ads can overcome the enormous namespace advantage /r/Bitcoin has, not to mention its historical advantage. I'm a little weirded out that you'd even try that line of reasoning. Have you no sense of scale, or is the partisanship that blinding?
">unfortunately they enforce rules that justify censorship. 

Specifically, how does core developers listed there ""enforce rules that justify censorship""?"
I don't think this hyperbole helps your case and I want big blocks. Keep up the rhetoric if you want, but I don't support it.  The ideals being trampled by Theymos are laughable compared to what NK is actually doing to people.  Or maybe I am mistaken and simply missed the news about Theymos detonating nuclear devices underground?
"The difference is that one is the community exercising their limited power to vote, which never actually removes the comment.

The other is the mods completely removing any discussion mentioning the things they don't like so no one gets to see it or discuss it going forwards.

It's like the difference between protestors and a dictator. Not really comparable as one has a monopoly on the use of force (the ability to delete posts/threads).

I'll admit that both subs attempt to control the narrative in some way, but if you can't admit that the methods use to control discussion in both subs are vastly different then you are not being honest."
"> Ver has paid for reddit advertising multiple times

r/bitcoin still ranks way higher than r/btc in Google searches, the place most new people come from.

> their is always cross posts between forums and users participating in both subs

People talking about r/bitcoin here can say anything they want, either good or bad.

People talking about r/btc there get censored if the post doesn't align with the mods' ideology.

For Average Joe who just found about internet money, goes to r/bitcoin and sees people only talking bad things about r/btc, it's more probable that he'll be successfully manipulated into not wanting to go there.
"
"BS/Core discuss development in such pleases where moderators enforce such rules as as ""Hard Fork discussion is off topic"" and retread offenses of the rules will have you banned and first offenses are removed."
">  and sees people only talking bad things about r/btc, it's more probable that he'll be successfully manipulated into not wanting to go there.

You don't understand marketing and thus are probably clueless to the benefit of negative PR (Reason why Trump is president and why Howard Stern became so popular ) Negative PR will attract attention and people visiting your sites/platforms ... but they aren't staying, you want to reflect upon why.

bitusher knows this. Don't feed the troll. 
"You mean here -

So you are upset with the moderation policies in these 2 areas where core devs discuss development?"
"Negative PR is a thing, but is not as powerful as you say, unless you can provide me with references for this cliam.

> Reason why Trump is president

Are you saying people voted for Trump only to stop evil Hillary? Because I know people who voted for Hillary to stop evil Trump. It goes both ways, and the fact that both candidates got more than 48% proves it."
Thats insane you can just say now why trump is president. You lose credibility saying this like this.
I know how it came about. I don't think it's helpful to the conversation. 
Was just banned from r/bitcoin ( againnnnn ) so ACK. also i hope SegWit will get blocked until HF code is implemented in Core.
"> Most these users are aware of r/btc but simply don't agree with the ideas being promoted

I will need a citation on this one. If Average Joe wants to know what this Bitcoin thing is, he'll find r/bitcoin and never be aware of either the censorship or the existence of r/btc."
That's beside the point. People need to have 100% of the data available to them to make informed decisions. Hiding opinions you dislike is cowardly and hurts bitcoin.
I think his arguments on this point so far are airy crap, but that doesn't make him a troll. 
u got it bb
bot checking in.
And yet I can still see your posts and respond. That's a lot better than what's going on at /r/bitcoin
"# show me the data.


I see no data to back up your opinon, as that is what you were asked for and you don't have it we have to assume 6our opinion is not backed by real data"
"ftfu.

I said Classic was hardly an improvement over Core they both enforced an arbitrarily low limit - 2MB was just as bad as 1MB. 

"
"you make a good point lets censor the internet./s

FYI i didn't invest in BTC because of all the information discouraging it was censored. i made a choice based on reading all the information i could, good and bad. 

people need to see both sides of an argument before they cam feel they are making an informed choice.

North Korea is no different, it's a tragedy waiting to happen. "
How many people does this sub reach vs how many people does r/bitcoin reach?
roll eyes, what about bitcointalk.org, bitcoin.org, Bitcoin IRC, bitcoin Slack. and r/bitcoin?
you sure do
yeah, cause you don't want the rbitcoin people to know that there's nothing wrong. It's a gigantic potemkin village you've built there where undesirable people and comments disappear in an instant.
"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XVaMBNNBCyM/hqdefault.jpg

I don't know why you ran a bot, are you afraid to let people have opinions that disagree with your own?
Some people prefer a fake and manipulated reality to the truth, others disagree 
There are around 3-4x as many active users in r/bitcoin on average despite heavy advertising by ver. Most these users are aware of r/btc but simply don't agree with the ideas being promoted in r/btc and are bored and annoyed with the trolling and misinformation which is higher in r/btc
"> How many people does this sub reach

Thankfully hardly anyone.  This place has gone full retard with it's attempt to slander Core and now block SegWit because they're not getting exactly what they want."
https://bitcoincore.org/  and   https://bitcoincore.slack.com/  aren't  in control of by Theymos and were specifically developed by some core developers to distance themselves from Theymos. 
"> yeah, cause you don't want the rbitcoin people 

This is just a lie . I openly criticize Theymos and talk about the moderation/censorship differences between r/btc and r/bitcoin. 

>it's a gigantic potemkin village you've built 

I don't control, manage, or moderate r/bitcoin and certainly haven't built it as I post here more often. 

Any more lies you want to spread?
"
Please stop the NK rhetoric. I'm tired of this debate, too, but it's not helpful. No one is being murdered or jailed here, this is just the Internet. 
"LOL, just letting you know those are people down-voting you. not bots.

I love reading diverse opinions, you are not contribution with an opinion though you're trying to justify censorship. "
"Whoosh. Of course you're not directly stealing from me. I said that to demonstrate your attitude 

>its just that it seems there isn't much that can be done

Hey, 20k people have joined this sub presumably because of censorship problems in N Korea. That's why discussion centers around this issue which is probably the most significant in Bitcoin today. Don't begrudge those of us willing to fight for this liberty and freedom that we thought should have been upheld by small blockheads. For better perspective, listen to this excellent talk by Glenn Greenwald on Why Privacy Matters: https://www.ted.com/talks/glenn_greenwald_why_privacy_matters

He does a wonderful job explaining why we should care and why you should respect those of us at the margins who do fight to preserve freedom of privacy (my analogy here being freedom of speech which is just as important) , something you and the others apparently take for granted. Furthermore, you spend quite a bit of time here outright trolling us for it. 

This subs raison d'etre is exactly to fight censorship. "
ACK
"It should cut down on the need to rehash the history all the time. There being two subs demands a reason, and now there is clear, simple, definitive one to point to. Hopefully with the distraction of constantly scrambling to prove the point out of the way, we can get on to discussing other things, like how to smoke Core's doors off with Bitcoin Unlimited ;)

EDIT a day later: So far it seems to have only fanned the flames. In /r/Bitcoin there is a thread where people are being massively upvoted for saying things like ""/r/btc is more censored than here."" At least we've reached the ""now they fight you"" stage."

Censorship on r bitcoin is majority enforced rule. There is nothing you could do. If you do not like bitcointalk either use decentralized forum solutions. Why stick to tiny reddit bitcoin community?
Lets run around in circles being obsessed about one persons moderation policies instead of improving bitcoin. /s
Most core developers don't care about Theymos or petty reddit politics but Adam Back has repeatedly denounced censorship - https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/692651536120430594
You left out the part where people used bots to downvote other people to hide their opinions and that rbtc was used to make enemies lists and people posted death threats and other daily personal attacks against core developers
The biggest problem I have with this is that Reddit is allowing this shady behaviour. All the things that are happening in /r/Bitcoin are explicitly forbidden.
"Regarding the early history - when Theymos defined XT as an ""alt-coin"", because it provided much bigger blocks:

By that definition, many changes to Bitcoin could be considered an ""altcoin"":

- XT, Classic, BitPay's Adaptive blocksize, etc. - all making a change to the blocksize

- SegWit - making a massive change in the data structures, requiring rewriting nearly all wallet and exchange software

- Lightning - making a drastic change to Bitcoin's network topology

This shows that their definition of an ""alt-coin"" is total bullshit:

- They classify a *minimal* change (increasing the blocksize), as an ""alt-coin""

- They classify a *gigantic* change (rewriting all the software, drastically changing the network topology) as ""Bitcoin""

They are liars who are trying to force their language and ideology on the rest of the community, to support the plans of one company: [~~AXA~~](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin+btc/search?q=axa&restrict_sr=on) Blockstream.

I had to read it again, you are doing Satoshi's work. Any Bitcoin business owner, user and developer cannot ignore this. If they do, they indirectly promote Bitcoin centralization and betray Bitcoin principles.  
"This quote sums the whole tragedy up

"Great work again - sad to read, but well composed.

Anyone who is aware of and passively accepts this kind censorship is complicit in the ongoing perpetration of this odious practice and is a weak and pathetic human being who it is impossible for me to have any respect towards and definitely no trust in.  

Whether censorship harms or helps your POV it should be spoken out about with equal strength.  It is corrosive, divisive and dishonest.  There will be two potential outcomes - rebellion or abandonment - neither will be good for bitcoin's reputation - but some kind of rebellion - eg blocking segwit activation,may actually save it in the long run. "
A suggestion- you might add how StarMaged was demodded.  Star enforced the policy to the letter as (s)he was required to, but was eventually demodded from /r/bitcoin for not being sufficiently zealous or something like that...
If you read just the beginning you might think that you should use BitcoinTalk instead of r\/bitcoin.

Fantastic post!  Where can we tip you?
wow, fantastic work!  i've wondered whether some smart, dedicated individual could/would document just a fraction of the censored posts and bans that have taken place over the last year and a half or so.  that's a brutal and damning list that should be archived for posterity.  such a shameful, disgusting situation created by small blockheads and core dev.  those guys deserve to be ostracized from Bitcoin.
"Wow, a long needed summary post I feel, and an important post that people need to see, I'm not really ""pro big blocks"" especially but I just find it heartbreaking to see the censorship.. if big blocks are such a naff idea then lets just openly discuss and debate and reject it... even more heartbreaking as most casual bitcoin observers don't realize how bad it is.

So I want to do my part, I made this advert: http://coinad.com/?a=Ad&b=IGX2J4DJIRF45 , self funded it with 0.1btc ($70). It will display 1 million times right across all of these websites: http://coinad.com/?a=Advertise (A LARGE selection of the worlds leading free bitcoin faucets and games - our games and incentive sites alone, we gave out around 900btc+ over the last 2 years) - no these users probably aren't bitcoin CEOs and silicon valley VCs, but they are the NEW, grass roots bitcoin users, claiming their first free micro bitcoin units and learning what it is and how it works..

I previously reached out to u/MemoryDealers to see if there was any interest in taking ongoing ads with us (I'm the owner of coinad.com) to r/btc or to bitcoin.com but without response.. I'm optimistic and interested to see the results, and if they are positive - if people really click through and want to read this information then I'd love to try and work out an ongoing way to showcase this side of things."
