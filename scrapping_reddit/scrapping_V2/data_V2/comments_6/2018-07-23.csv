This is why I was against his sentencing being as strict as it was. It was totally based on his alleged murder for hire that he'd yet to be convicted for. Now he's just a guy who ran a website. 
wait for the anti trump wave 2020 and get him released under a reasonbale president
Didn't he conspire to commit murder, though?  I thought they found chat records where he ordered hits on people who worked for him, and he thought had stolen from him.  Even if the murders never took place.
"If he's not guilty of the attempted murder, by that logic he's not guilty of the drug offenses.
"
Don't drop the soap!
Yes, even if you think he should be imprisoned for running the Silk Road website, I seriously doubt that most people would agree that life in prison is an appropriate sentence. I find it cruel and unusual, ie a violation of his rights under the 8th Amendment. How many people have ever been sentenced to life in prison for running a website?
You are a fucking idiot. 
"His sentence is good and he deserves it. This is a victory.

JAIL ROSS"
"*she

It can't be satire because satire is supposed to be funny."
That's not terribly important to the conversation, though. The people who run the justice system only recognize (we hope) the rights written down in the laws of the United States. Under their own system, the punishment seems an egregious violation of Ulbricht's supposed rights.

Unfortunately the justice system is particular terrible when it comes to the issue of drugs. Due to the three-strike laws, you can easily be put away for life if you have multiple run-ins with the law, even if you didn't hurt anyone.
Exactly.
Yeah, thanks for the clarification.
I remain skeptical
Americans have a right to a speedy trial under the sixth amendment. It's not a very robust right to be sure, but the government can't indict someone and let the case languish indefinitely. 
"this guy created silk road, a website where you could operate without a trace and trade legal or illegal things,

deserved jail, maybe.

double life sentence, ridiculous...."
"Facilitating the sale of drugs is not attempted murder. If I were trying to assassinate someone, I wouldn't try to sell them some hash.

Ulbricht was given a disproportionate sentence for what amounted to nonviolent crimes. His sentence should be dramatically reduced, or dropped altogether, seeing as he's already served years.

In a Libertarian society, no charges would've been filed in the first place, as everyone has the right to conduct voluntary contracts."
"There's little doubt that he was involved in the facilitation of the sale of narcotics, I don't think he even denied it.  He was caught red handed logged into the admin account of Silk Road.

The murder plot was always up in the air though and with the involvement of corrupt agents who were directly involved with that aspect of the case, it's very possible it was fabricated entirely. I don't think you can base one on the other."
">life in prison

\* double life sentence"
Rights don't come from a piece of paper.
Why?
Observe the shill account, less than 6 months old, username is an attempt to troll and the comments are lies or set to cause maximum controversy. 
What did he do?
Ah the filth of reddit stinking up what use to be a site worth using...
"> This is why I was against his sentencing being as strict as it was. It was totally based on his alleged murder for hire that he'd yet to be convicted for

That may have factored in emotionally, but at sentencing what the judge basically said was Ross needed to be severely punished simply because he thought he could thumb his nose at the government and get away with it.  She was sending a cruel message of hate to freedom lovers everywhere, at Ross's expense."
Wow such great news. That is all. 
Good news, hopefully this means he can at least eventually be eligible for parole, wouldn't hold my breath though..
FREE ROSS
Is this as promising for him as it sounds?
Signed
How will this affect his sentence? He can still be charged with other things.
I could not find a source to confirm this and the tweet in question doesn't link anything. I'd be skeptical until shown something more concrete than a random tweet

I sense the faint, distant scent of hope.
I signed the petition. What a travesty of justice. 
"Lol remember how many people would default to the argument ""but le murders""

"
"His sentence is grotesque and outrageous. This is a tragedy.


FREE ROSS"
Or satire. What he's saying is pretty obviously satire.
He's coming home, he's coming home! 
"So isn't this grounds for some kind of new appeal? I mean a double life sentence for a website that everyone else who was involved with running only got 10 years, max?

The thing that bugs me is that [someone did an analysis](https://coinreport.net/many-lives-silk-road-save/) (edit: added link) and determined that Silk Road actually made the underground trade of these illicit things *safer*. This guy basically saved lives in a dangerous black market that was going to exist anyway. And the whole murder-for-hire thing was entrapment, pure and simple.

What if he intended to make a truly free and open marketplace but the people used it as a drug swap meet 
But my screen is not 3D :(
