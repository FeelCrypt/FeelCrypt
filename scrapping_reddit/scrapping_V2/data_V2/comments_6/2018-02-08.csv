">dissenting comments can be seen on r/btc. 

They can be seen here too. The mods don't censor people, they only block discussion that's blatantly against the rules. BCH discussion isn't it's just controversial unless you're being inflammatory. These arguments get tossed around all the time and the comments are *never* banned. Why would a censorship apparatus let people *point out* that it's a censorship apparatus?"

A dodgy looking hotel accepting a dodgy cryptocurrency. Makes sense actually. 
Lmao.
"The Herbert Hotel is an institution in these parts and Bitcoin Cash is far from dodgy as:

1. Bitcoin Cash has been gifted the *largest coin distribution* of any crypto due to blockstream/core driving away BTC's merchants and the common blockchain heritage. That puts Bitcoin Cash as far from dodgy as you can get.

2. Bitcoin Cash enjoys the *fastest transactions* (no crypto has faster merchant trades) with its 0-conf. It is even faster than the so-called lightening network which must make multiple interactive hops to an online recipient. As the [median](https://www.swiftinstitute.org/sites/default/files/upload/The%20Statistics%20of%20Payments_v15%20-%20Chapter%2010%20How%20big%20is%20that%20payment.pdf) cash spend is just $15, 0-conf can be safely used for the vast majority of BCH transactions. Bitcoin Cash 0-conf is also about as far from dodgy as you can get.

3. Bitcoin Cash always operates *uncongested by design*, even when it becomes the first [global currency](http://blog.vermorel.com/journal/2017/12/17/terabyte-blocks-for-bitcoin-cash.html), your BCH transaction will still get into the next block. Uncongested operation is very un-dodgy.

4. Bitcoin Cash has 10 minute block times necessary for *on-chain scaling to global levels*. It has already proven on-chain scaling to 8MB blocks and can scale on-chain to 32MB blocks by simply relaxing a soft-limit. The Bitcoin Cash testnet has [mined](https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://news.bitcoin.com/gigablock-testnet-researchers-mine-the-worlds-first-1gb-block/&ved=0ahUKEwiwxZCYv7DYAhWCx7wKHfD1DJUQFgglMAA&usg=AOvVaw0lommjypr6e-N0LaD5-Qb7) 1 GB blocks demonstrating on-chain scaling to beyond visa levels, and this [study](http://blog.vermorel.com/journal/2017/12/17/terabyte-blocks-for-bitcoin-cash.html) examines on-chain scaling to blocks supporting 10 billion people x 50 TXs/day! This great work looking deep into Bitcoin Cash's future make it also far from dodgy.

5. Bitcoin Cash has now begun to drive merchant [adoption](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7uhy0o/bitcoin_cash_lifes_a_bch/) with its *network effect*, an advantage acquired along with the influx of merchants. You can expect Bitcoin Cash to resume the same dominant market position it held prior to the blockstream/core aberration. Including the Herbert Hotel, these merchants as demonstrating that Bitcoin Cash is not dodgy.

6. Bitcoin Cash is supported by a community that is bound by *vision and generosity* rather than censorship and deceit. It enjoys the high moral ground of ""a peer-to-peer electronic cash system"" as described in the [whitepaper](https://bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf). Enjoying the high moral ground makes Bitcoin Cash not-dodgy also. And then there is the awesome community making Bitcoin Cash very not-dodgy.

It is your statement that is rather dodgy, as it is incorrect on *all* of its three points.

Interesting. I do agree that it’s convenient to drop the cash part but probably for different reasons. What bothers me is not that BCH copied and pasted bitcoins code... many altcoins have done that... it’s that the community fraudulently hijacked Bitcoins name and continues to confuse and scam new people thinking that they’re buying cheap bitcoin when they’re really just buying another altcoin. There’s nothing wrong with altcoins... BCH seems to be doing well for how new it is but the hostility and mudslinging that comes from this community is toxic to all cryptos. I hope BCH does well because I hold more coins then I do with BTC but I don’t see why we all just can’t live and let live.

LOL, see... At the end of the day, you prove the r/Bitcoin mods' ban reason to be right.

Not true. BCH is the closest approximation of Satoshi's whitepaper: indefinite chain of signatures secured by burned energy without capacity cap (8MB limit will be removed eventually with or without a new fork). Though, BTC is more like copycat

> fraudulently

Permissionless systems didn't exist before 2009. Bitcoin (Cash) is above jurisdictions. Deal with it. Nothing legal applies including bullshit software licences of any kind, copyleft or copyright

> I don’t see why we all just can’t live and let live

Let's just do that. r/btc community, myself included, doesn't appreciate calling Bitcoin Cash something else. U still can do it, ofc"
Soft forks force hard forks. There is no distinction. Bitcoin cash is The Bitcoin with a reasonable max-blocksize increase (as compared to temporary old limit) as debated for years and uncontroversial back then.
"I see this argument a lot, and while I feel BCH still has some flaws to fix and it's not the better coin by any standard, it is the coin Satoishi described in his white paper, while BTC is not.

And while people might say: technology should evolve and change, and I agree with that, there's really no reason why BTC should be Bitcoin and BCH not. What gives BTC developers the claim over that name? The only one who could claim it is Satoishi, who has been silent for years, but since his white paper specifically mentions Bitcoin and predates the github project by over a year Core developers have as much claim to the name as Cash developers."
"Because there are a metric fuckton of instances of them actually censoring things because they don't like the content, not because it breaks the rules. The two are not the same.

this is not true if you question why a bitcoin implementation that mines valid bitcoin blocks full of valid bitcoin transactions to the Bitcoin Blockchain is an altcoin, that breaks one of the rules and you get banned.

Any evidence of violating Reddit ToS?

Then why isn't there any actual evidence? Mere allegations don't count.

Presumably you know there are hundreds of screenshots along with other evidence readily available if you scroll down in this sub.  You're not an idiot, stop pretending to be one and go troll elsewhere.

"I've looked towards the potential counterparty offers. I've read your posts and I respect you taking the time to write. Seems in return some core devs have consistently resorted to aggression and ad hominems. Baffling. As i see counterparty has implementrd workarounds to avoid censorship and have added things like batching, and segwit soon iirc. Does not even require touching an 'alt coin'- you can directly issue an asset on the blockchain with btc only and store it on the blockchain. Then there is the possibility of trustless p2p exchange. 

Considering the fact the founders of the project chose not to immediately enrich themselves and instead 'burnt' btc then began innovating silently which is more or less saintly compared to hundreds of other projects, (it may even be the minority exception) To this day I am absolutely baffled to go back and look at some of the core devs pervasive and absolutetly venomous attacks on the project (censoring transactions, resorting to verbal aggression, reducing features, advocating lowering block size. You're absolutely right that a huge amount of capital and mindshare was ferried away into a project which now competes against bitcoin due to unnecesary hostility. There will be no doubt billions of dollars of value add on top of the eth chain, many for now may be worthless, or outright scams even but over time the market will mature and correct. I simply cannot understand where seemingly respected and rational actors have such hate and how they refuse to acknowledge that things could have been done better."

There are casual use cases for which the convenience is IMO, WELL worth the diminished security.

Personally, I think you'd need to be incredibly foolish to make financial decisions based on unoriginal Twitter posts. If I saw hundreds of posts all sounding the same, I'd go and do some research to verify if anything mentioned was true.

Merchants and entrepreneurs are in general smarter than your average newcomer to cryptocurrencies who's only interested in getting rich, so they can see through misinformation tactics. I certainly wouldn't make decisions for my business based on what some toxic Twitter trolls post."

"> log into an exchange, buy bitcoin and that’s their whole experience. They get no clue from this just how far BTC is from being useable. 

BCH isn't really usable etither. It has lower fees atm, but BTC fees are lowering and LN will remove any large fees. Really, BTC is still in beta phase. It is just an investment for the future. All altcoins are just investments. Nothing is usable as of now. 

BTC is the main pair for altcoins on almost all exchanges. 
LTC is better to send money and quick transfers. 

I have nothing against BCH it is just a copy of a product that works slightly better but has no real use case. Sure it has some partners but honestly how much of your daily expenses could be bought with BCH? The main use case for the real bitcoin is to be the main currency pair. That's all folks."
"Well. THe whole ""Bitcoin Cash is bitcoin"" mantra is misleading as hell.

I'd be fine with ""Bitcoin Cash is better than bitcoin"". THat's a valid opinion, even if I don't agree.

And there is definitely a media campaign FUDing pretty decent technology advances that are upcoming for Bitcoin - with speculations about LN talked about as if they are facts, and the massive conspiracy theories that I recently dubbed ""Alt right""-like, and I guess I did get some well deserved critisism for that comparision. But there's a massive campaign going on from this side, too, trying to smear BTC with speculations mislabeled as facts.

This is actually the reason why most people see BCH as a shitcoin. They need a smear campaign to succeed."

Because they are incompetent?
"> But seriously why would Blockstream spend time and money to fight Bitcoin Cash? 

The same reason they fought the community for 4 years while hijacking the project and the brand. They want exclusivity and to make Bitcoin a private venture. Bitcoin Cash is a reminder of what BTC used to be and undermines their business model.

Well, yes and no. I Interpreted it as blockstream  manipulating people into fighting for their narrative and doing such actions, instead of them performing on their own. Even though they most liklely do that as well since it's the most reasonable thing to do when pushing an agenda. Thinking about that, blockstream might not do it on their own since it's a reasonable thing to do and that's not what blockstream is known for.

"All this might be true. Here's the issue though: I have friends that have been in this space between 1-5 years. I'm not talking online buddies I've never met. These are best friends to family members. They have been nagging me for years to get into Bitcoin (WHY DIDN'T I LISTEN?!?!?!?!). The person who has been in the longest is deep into Bitcoin and altcoins (even gave me some USB miner thing back in 2013 I thought was a virus so I didn't connect it ((WHY DIDN'T I LISTEN?!??!?!?)) He doesn't even talk about Bitcoin Cash. Any of these people I trust that are doing very well financially are very negative towards Bitcoin Cash and say it is a scam. None of them say Bitcoin isn't what it was supposed to be.

Part of me thinks they are just being reactionary, and then I have a comment like yours which calls Bitcoin Cash ""Bitcoin (the Cash fork)"" and I think they are right. It just seems less than honorable to try and hijack something that most of the Crypto world thinks is just fine.

This is when you say everyone is not fine with it, but the Bitcoin Cash folks are the only people I see up in arms about things. The Exchanges still do primary trading against BTC not BCH. If the fees and everything else you all complain about was this monumental issue, people would be jumping ship like crazy.

"Your posts in this thread give a good insight, thanks for taking the time to share.

I can give you my personal view, maybe it'll inform yours.

* I'm rather new as well (been interested for years, even saw the birth of ethereum almost as it was happening, but didn't feel like investing until late last year. *I know... You know... we know. Let's leave it at that.*)

* BTC vs. BCH was a topic I left on the side for some time. I used ETH to buy other coins anyway (Binance, Kucoin have lots of ETH pairs). 

* I don't own BTC and only a tiny amount of BCH. I don't really care for any bitcoin, it's the legendary origin of cryptos that I don't see prevailing forever. I'm looking at more 'modern' cryptos, newer gens as they say.


* It seems to me that history is written by the winners and so the consensual ""everyone agrees"" version is that BTC is Bitcoin and BCH is the fork. In technical terms, what I came to realize is that it's the opposite in fact. 

    BTC was more or less bought up at different levels, in a hostile manner (showing the door to legendary developers/promoters not aligned with the new management), and is now mostly centralized in direction. LN is just a furtherance of this new BTC paradigm (think: major hubs, i.e. *liquidity banks*, rather than peer-to-peer network). 

    It is, imho, a clear case of under-the-hood anticlimactic manipulation, which the BCH crowd isn't taking too well, understandably so as they see the name bitcoin lose its profound meaning (which in historical terms is a big deal, there's a *before* and an *after* crypto). The BTC crowd feels the same (mirror feeling) but I don't think they realize what's happened (or they don't really care and just follow the money, very likely to switch allegiance whenever something else becomes the dominant cryptocurrency).

* Regardless of legitimacy, looking only from business and development standpoints, Blockstream (the company essentially ruling over BTC) seems to be high on something: they're all over the place in an unordered manner (vision, strategy, projects...), they create enemies when there really is no reason (e.g. promoting their own LN+language in vocal opposition to Lightning Labs which is already doing the good work...). 

    The whole stance Blockstream adopts, quite antagonistic and righteous and yet lacking vision, reminds me of companies high on pride and ultimately on a bad slippery slope. This is why I'm expecting a ""flippening"" (i.e. some other coin (e.g. ETH or Stellar or whatever) taking over BTC in market cap) sooner rather than later. 2018.

* I think the feud between Bitcoins (Blockstream vs. Cash) will ultimately discredit both. It's a case of ""if I can't have my cake, neither can you"" lose-lose situation. Which is not a bad thing per se as it gives more space and exposure to other cryptos, and we need many different cryptos for a true emergence of *""the internet of money""* as some people call this space.

* About trading/investing, we should see two major innovations in the space this year: first the ability to move (""swap"") from/to any crypto, thereby allowing anyone to use their preferred one(s) as reference; secondly decentralized exchanges which should help swapping and bring more security to the space.

"

There was a big issue with fees.. many vendors jumped ship.. Are you not familiar?  

**edit:** but your friends are not here for that long if you say the oldest one is from 2013. But ye I dunno

**edit2** when I said Bitcoin (the Cash fork). I did it because I was talking about the protocol, the initial protocol. The parenthesis is to say that the protocol Bitcoin with space for transactions is the fork Bitcoin Cash. but I was talking more broadly that it, that's why. Sorry for the confusion

A hedge against 2x not activating? That’s not at all accurate. Bitcoin Cash was made by Bitmain to have a non-Segwit fork of bitcoin which allowed them to continue using covert Asicboost. This is the reality. 
"I have read most of them. All quite speculative.

If you have decided that Blockstream and Core is corrupt, these posts make perfectly sense. But all of them are quite speculative, there's no hard proof. Do I believe that r/Bitcoin could be better if it was less censored. Hell, yes! But this does not change the beliefs I have that we need to make sure the blockchain does not grow to bloat. And the hard disk space is *not* the issue, latency when transferring blocks and centralization incentives is.

And I truly wish there was more honest and open discussion from both sides. But right now, both sides is quite determined that the other side is evil and has to die."

Well that's definitely new to me and I've been watching all of this very closely since the start."
"> I'd be fine with ""Bitcoin Cash is better than bitcoin"".

I agree, and for good reasons.

Bitcoin is just a generic name. None of the existing cryptocurrencies exactly matches Bitcoin as it was originally designed. All have deviated from it to various degrees. Bitcoin Core is very different, Bitcoin Cash is slightly different. Bitcoin Cash is an upgrade, while Bitcoin Core is a significant downgrade.

So yes, Bitcoin Cash is clearly better than the original Bitcoin.

For completeness, we should say:

"> You really should take a deep breath and then visit other sources besides where you are being fed your beliefs. You certainly aren’t doing your own research. Heck just google crypto with real uses.

I did, found nothing. I think you need to follow your advice. Are you team BCH vs team BTC, then you have already lost. I don't take sides. When trying to understand which of these two are better i see mainly propaganda on both sides.

BCH is made to profit ASIC miners and Jihan team. BTC is made to profit Blockstream sure. Don't see really how the could monopolize open source second layer solutions since any company is able to. Regarding blocksizes I think slightly bigger blocks are good to meet the transactions demands but focus should be on compression of data and more advanced future proof  technical solutions, schnorr and segwit seems to be working fine.

All else is just retarded bully and us/them mentality. I gave up on visiting reddit because ya'll have a toxic mindset not actually discussing things openly. BTH is a vitcim and BTC a meme teenager. lol"
"Well you should understand what bitcoin is supposed to be. If you understand that, maybe reading the whitepaper etc. you're good. For me I don't really see the point of most altcoins. Bitcoin (the Cash fork) is fine as it is, with enough space for transactions. 

All the bashing is more of a reaction to the immense amount of fud from the other side. And the fact they screwed what Bitcoins was supposed to be."
Hilarious that you think asking for provable facts is trolling.  (doubly so since you follow me so closely and I don't have the foggiest who you are)

You have no idea how stupid you sound
"First of all: I really love to read the latest conspiracy theories on /r/btc and the ""/r/bitcoin admins attacked their own sub"" is one of my all time favs for sure :) 

But back to initial topic: My initial comment was unrelated to the topic. Think of it as a PSA so people don't forget who the author is. 

And now back to our own topic (I know its YOU williamlondon! lol): Look, there is a definition of the word fact. And all I did was differentiate what we know for a fact, and what not.  Look what happens if we don't clearly separate fact from fiction in discussions: You first ego wrote 10hours ago: ""Hundreds of botted accounts mixed with some real ones"", your alter ego wrote 22mins ago: ""It was more than just ""some accounts"", and were clearly all bots"". 
So now we went from some bots to all bots. why did this happened? because the botiness of the accounts is not proven factual knowledge, and everyone interprets it in a way, that fits his spin of the story.
My stance is: it could be one of the twitter-pun online jokes, originating in some btc related forum somewhere. 
See the difference? I write ""could"" because I don't know. You don'T know as well, but postulate your theories as fact."
Because it can motivate people here that believe in it? If it seems like an attack, the beat defense would be to increase usage, or that's what I would imagine
"Perhaps. Although I'd still like to think merchants and entrepreneurs have a goal of keeping their businesses afloat, and that means satisfying most of their userbase. I doubt the ones with the loudest voices make up a majority of their customers, since most users tend to be moderate.

&nbsp;

Many assumptions in my post, I know, but it helps in simplifying the process of putting myself in their shoes. I'm sure reality isn't as clear-cut."
"Yes Twitter is just a shithole.  The second biggest one after Facebook.  Total toilet. Twitter is the crapper for hundreds of reasons.  Its a little weird to compare it to Reddit.  I'm not interested in some ""hashtag"" crap or some retweeting shit. Smart people don't use inferior Shitter."
Yes but then there is no need at all to use an altcoin like bcash when the real bitcoin will fill all needs
"yeah, I had to learn this, too.

The userbase increases during every ""bubble"". That's why it blows up. So there's plenty of inexperience coming in.  And when it ""bursts"", they learn (or at least some of them).

The hate from both sides, the shilling and bots.. It's madness. It will end up destroying everything if it continues this way.
Well that's just the average day on twitter xD
I've been noticing the parallels between bitcoin core supporters and clinton supporters for a while now, and this fits nicely.  During the election I remember posts just like this where it would be some basic bitch equality take or some anti-Trump thing spammed dozens of times by accounts with stock photos of women as AVIs.
They did the exact same thing to Tether (USDT) reddit yesterday. Just look at all the bs accounts. These people need to be shutdown, period. They exist for one purpose to either create FUD or FOMO and its ridiculous.
"Attention seems to be the key resource in many Cryptos that don’t offer much value otherwise.

"I don't see desperation, just ""war"". And so far BTC is winning. Specially now that the mempool is semi-empty and fees are down. BCH is slightly pointless at the moment."
Wow, excellent investigative work. So worthy of a top post for the day. 7 bots saying #Bcashistrash. Riveting stuff, please keep us up to date with the postings on the internet of such significant value to the community. We are a much better place after your post. Thank you!
What if I told you this is the truth !
Im not surprised, many coins got same thing over years.
"Funny thes conspiracy theories, reality of course is nobody beyond a very small minority in BTC or BCH cares.

It just goes to show that in no matter what area, people will group together creating external enemy's."
For all I know you could be the one doing these bots.
bots sometimes speak the truth
Wishful thinking and exaggeration
Why is it upsetting? Bcash fan boys spend 99% obsessing and spreading FUD about bitcoin. If you have to insult others to make a name for yourself, you know where you stand :)  Sorry not trying to be toxic but may want to look at the majority of posts here for yourself to see how obsessed this subredit is regarding bitcoin. 
Bcash died at Coinbase launch sadly... RIP 
Bcash is trash indeed! 
I think its the gov. They wouldnt just let a new currency replace the dollar. 
What evidence is there to substantiate this? BCash is struggling to maintain 0.12, I don't think Blockstream needs to do anything but watch the BCash death spiral from a distance. 
BCash is trash.   And a scam coin with no identity of its own. 
Bcash is too schemey for me 
Bitcoin cash is trash though 🧐

Or maybe just a bunch of likeminded trolls copying the comment for the lulz? I mean, trolling bcash is incredibly easy with the butthurt over it being called bcash.
But it is trash
No they are all real accounts. The bitcoin fork, known as bcash, is just really shit...
bitcoin cash is trash #bcashistrash
I don't understand this tactic. Do they think these kinds of posts sway opinions?
Hahaha 6 - 8 likes 😂 that's how many I get and I'm really unpopular! Who's view are they hoping to change. Pathetic
Well fact is these accounts are synchronized to put this info out, which draws the conclusion this is a paid service... So ask, why would someone pay to trash a crypto, if it were ''just another alt''...? I dont see twitter bots attacking bitbeans... BCH must be doing good ))
To be fair it might not be blockstream. Could be someone just loyal to them or someone shorting bch.
Note the botted likes too... anyone not convinced yet?
Funny how if you talk in favor of BCH you're a paid shill, if hundreds do it for BTC is alright.
"Some years ago I stumbled upon a list with several thousand Twitter credentials of fresh accounts, which haven't posted nothing or some ad spam. Turned into quite an interesting weekend project to build my own command center to coordinate all of them at the same time.

This could be something very similar - just a project for fun."
I don't know what kind of people would do such despicable and unethical stuff but it truly smells of desperation. 
This is likely to affect the trading bots that trade on sentiment.
Meanwhile, 8 hours later, BCH spiked 20% up. Coincidence?? (In reality, probably yes, but...)
They sure do love proof of twitter.
But is it an issue that Dogecoin has more transactions per day than Bitcoin Cash does? Serious question. Does that mean Doge is a more successful currency (until Bitcoin Cash finally takes over, of course!). 
Seems legit. Real people having the exact same message at the exact same time.
I find it funny how all the BTC trolls come out of the woods on posts such as these.
The crying death throes of a mortally wounded Bitcoin BTC. LOL.
Does whoever pulled this actually think it will affect BCH!? What a capitalist pig!
How do we know this isn't the work of a Bitcoin cash shill trying to make blockstream look desperate? The only thing that can really be inferred is that it is the work of someone who has interests in bitcoin/bitcoin cash drama. Could be someone trying to make either side look bad. 
I like when they post by accident in videos from Ver and such that are not about crypto.
Then they fight you.
Those damn Russians 💪
Lol 
There's no such thing as bad press ... is there?
Lol did this cause it’s spike today?
I also noticed yesterday a few threads on this sub where pro-core stuff was getting upvoted like crazy.

It’s funny that they call it bitcoin cash instead of bcash when it suits them.  Shouldn’t they be concerned about new users thinking they’re calling bitcoin core trash?!? So much confusion!! They should just stick to their guns and call it bcash...
This shit has got to stop.
IIRC /u/btcnewsupdates is one of multiple accounts which were backtracked to a single agenda spamming guy a few months ago
"Wow. Much creative. Such original.  Very wisdom.

&nbsp;

Honestly, how can I take such posts seriously? It sounds as if they're just parroting what they heard from someone else. It fascinates me how much energy they consume in attacking BCH (by the way, notice how many of them don't attack other Bitcoin forks?); I feel they're threatened because BCH is actually gaining momentum. Think about it. If you really thought Bitcoin Cash was trash and unimportant, why would you waste so much time making such posts? What they don't realize is, that by doing so, they're actually giving BCH more attention, which is counterproductive to their goals."
Any way to mass report it to Twitter?
"Now put you're tinfoil hat on for me with this one...

Wouldn't it be believable that a bch supporter could be paying to do this too? As one redditor mentioned, even bad press is good press...

What's a good way to get your community fired up? Poke the bees nest. If I wanted to push you guys into driving bch for more mainstream adoption, this would certainly fire you up.

It's also easy to point to the ""other guy"" and say look what they did, they are bad and we are good. 

I think their are people on both sides of this that would stand to profit from this lame attack, that's all."
"If some smart people see this and actually start reading about bch then they’ll automatically realise how much potential bch has.

So let people spread these shitty posts as bad publicity is publicity anyway."
#bcashistrash 
Least the robots understand
Pretty sure bitcoin cash also did the same back then. Neither are innocent. It’s a war amongst family. 
For what its worth assuming batching you want to measure utxo/day not transactions per day
I'd be more inclined to use BCH irl if it had some privacy features at least shuffling.
So it's true... Bots really are smarter than humans.
"Doge gained itself a niche in exchanges for a long time, people like to hold their tradings temporarily in doge in times of great volatility because it being a deflationary currency it doesn't experience as big trading swings.

The actual dogecoin community is pretty dead last time I checked."

Spot on! I picture Hollywood's iconic dying robot scene, where the mortally damaged bot endlessly repeats its last words until it fades out.

Yeah they corrected the price for us.
"Psyops and social engineering.

Yes stop using centralised media like Twitter.
Does any of that dumb drama change the *fact* that we just saw a bunch of anti-BCH sockbot scripts screw up?
What for?  They do nothing or very little about Russian fake accounts.  lol.  You think there is a way to fix Twitter.
That comment reeks of concern trolling.
This has been ongoing since BCH came into existence. So this is done by BTC shills.
"Dogecoin has been around for years so has more trading pairs for now. However it is less secure bc it has less hashrate and there's no development occuring afaik. Additionally BCH is gaining merchants every day.

As a sidenote, isn't great that your Dogecoin comment isn't censored, unlike another forum where you might have been banned."
"They do. They stop newcomers from adopting BCH, they stop merchants and entrepreneurs from getting involved for fear of a public relation backlash. The economic damage is tangible.

Edit: if you wonder why the price of BCH looks ""heavy"", this is why"
Normally yes, but this is active and sustained propaganda, not the same as organic news.
"What you call ""war"" is fraudulent activities. We know you resort to this all the time, but here it is a nice and clear case of investor misinformation coordinated on a large scale. 

And BTW, this ""war"" is not ideological. It's purely to line a few scammers' pockets. BTC is screwed no matter what."
Mempool will just keep going down. Then txs per block. 
Well when prices climb again BTC will find itself again betwenn a rock and a hard place with a full mempool and high fees. The fundamentals haven't changed, BTC's block size is too small and the Lightning Network is riddled with problems.
in fact with segregated witness legacy bitcoin can never recovery techncoally, they will always suffer and be worse

I do get why they would do it. They think you all have evil intentions and they are protecting new crypto folks. I haven’t been in this long enough to know who is telling the truth, but I do see crypto scams all the time.

It seemed like something worth investing in after I heard Ver on the Rubin Report... and then I started reading the articles on Bitcoin.com. Why would that site try to bash Bitcoin in a way where they want to claim the title of “Real Bitcoin”? Just didn’t make sense to a noob like myself.

It seemed really weird that Bitcoin.com would trash Bitcoin. This is what turned me off of buying some. Now the Twitter for Bitcoin hates Bitcoin. They don’t recommend another coin that is far superior in tech to Bitcoin, nope., just this forked coin that is a little better than Bitcoin. That felt very scammy.

It was a total success, the investors in Segwit had it activated, that's all they wanted. They traded a 2X capacity increase the irony is that 2X increase was not even theirs to give. This fact makes it a double success.

Yes, everything dropped in relation to USD.  But BCH dropped in relation to BTC.  That's the difference I'm point out, which you're ignoring.  Just so we're clear, that means that BCH has lost more value than BTC during the same time period.

"> There's a reason why the vast majority of the technical community supported segwit.

OK its technically unnecessary except for the mailability fix to enable your LN research, the mailability fix being largely unnecessary for the vast majority of the network. 

**Who should be in charge of the bitcoin consensus rules miners or salaried technicians?**

>BCH only existed because it was thought up and funded by Jihan Wu. 

I think you are mistaken, it's investors in BTC and BCH who made it viable. I was a first-hand witness to the team that worked out the viability of the hard fork more than a year before Jihan published his UAHF troll post and well before Bitcoin ABC. The plan was ultimately initiated by grassroots activism after the DCG's NYA.  

>BCH attracted frauds and liars like Craig Wright and Roger Ver.

What evidence is there other than social media that these people are frauds, moreover what makes you think they are even relevant in any way? 

>Segwit was activated with 100% miner support

100% is just a rounding anomaly, only after the vast majority promised to upgrade the transaction limit to 2MB. The rounding error is a minority rejecting Segwit activation would have their blocks orphaned, so they had no choice.

I'm not the one rejecting facts or falling victim to manipulation in social media. 

None the less I'm glad you are still invested in Bitcoin BCH. The most viable bitcoin. "
"> Segwit was the corporate take over

Lol.. Just keep repeating this to yourself.  There's a reason why the vast majority of the technical community supported segwit.  And there's a reason why BCH only existed because it was thought up and funded by Jihan Wu.  BCH attracted frauds and liars like Craig Wright and Roger Ver.  I'm happy with the company I keep.  You can continue to support the efforts of Fake Satoshi and ""My opinion is relevant being I'm a millionaire"" Roger Ver.  These idiots couldn't code their way out of a paper bag.

> Why would one agree to activate the controversial change with 30% support

Segwit was activated with 100% miner support.  Not sure what numbers you're citing here..  But it's cool.  Who needs facts in a debate?  Just make up numbers whenever you want!  Good luck with that strategy."
"This whole thread was talking about it.

[Start here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/76olcz/just_so_you_guys_know_ethereum_just_had_another/dofzt23/)"
"Ever since it's peak in late december, BCH has been on a downtrend trading against BTC.  You dropped from ~.21 to .14 today.  This little blip today doesn't change the overall trend.

Look at the [big picture](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin-cash/#charts)"
"> Who should be in charge of the bitcoin consensus rules miners or salaried technicians?

Neither.  The community decides consensus.  This gets worked out in the marketplace.  Developers can push changes out, but if the users won't run it, then their changes are worthless.  Miners can signal all day long for changes, but if the users don't run it, the miners bail. Miners will always mine the chain that makes them the most income. Exchanges can make up labels like ""bc1"" or ""b2x"", but if the users boycott their exchanges, their labels are useless.

The bottom line is that no one group controls the protocol.  The market works it out.  Developers release their code, exchanges create their labels, miners can mine on whichever blockchain earns them the most revenue.  Consensus is the result of the free market picking which chain is called what, and how much is it worth.

That's where you guys go wrong.  You think miners dictate consensus, even though segwit2x proved you wrong.  The vast majority of miners signaled for 2x, yet when push came to shove, not a single miner dared to run that buggy software.

> What evidence is there other than social media that these people are frauds

Craig Wright literally claimed he was Satoshi, then bailed on the proof.  He uses uses this notoriety to trick investors into giving him money for his vaporware nChain.  No more needs to be said about him.  His reputation isn't debatable.  He's scum.  [Roger Ver is a pathological liar.  This is documented thoroughly.](https://youtu.be/yUO1DvqTpZ8)  These are bad people.

> 100% is just a rounding anomaly

Over the signaling period it was not a rounding anomaly.  Every single block, without exception, during the 2016 block period signaled to activated segwit.

> only after the vast majority promised to upgrade the transaction limit to 2MB. 

Promised?  What is this, the 2nd grade playground?  Did they pinky swear too?  This is a consensus driven network.  There are no promises.  Just code.  Miners were free to use whatever software they wanted.  Not a single one actually ran Garzik's buggy code.  Promises are worthless when blockchains are involved."
"LOL, the people who funded Segwit development and convinced the miners to activate it (the DCG) are the same interests that promised 2X in exchange for Segwit activation. 

Segwit was the corporate take over, 2X was the non-controversial concession for the users. 

Q: Why would one agree to activate the controversial change with 30% support before the non-controversial change that had over 50% support? 

A: Because there was concern that if the block size increase came first there would be no segwit. "
We've all said lots of thing.  In some instances we're right, and in some instances we're wrong.  All I know is I woke up to a remindme notification to this thread, and I found it comical how wrong you were here.  All you morons thought segwit2x was going to happen.  It put a smile on my face.
They've all been dropping. Especially BTC. You dropped before the 200dma. that's bad. 
Where did I say sw2x was definitely going to happen? 
I feel bad for you having sold all your BCH, BCH. 
You think. Keep thinking.
I think we're fine https://i.imgur.com/JldqBp5.png
What do you mean? The BCH price is staying pretty solid at 0.15 BTC over the past few months with a fewe ups and downs.
That's why.
For the last couple weeks BCH has been suffering worse than BTC on the dips and recovering more poorly. That's what I mean.
RemindMe! 3 years Time will tell how relevant bcash is in 3 years. 
Yet you claim it's oh so centralized.
Thats a perception but the facts are the moderators do a good job of pinging POSTS if they don't pertain to Bitcoin and mention alts. Post replies that mention altcoins often get through because the moderators can't read every message. If I see POSTS or replies that mention alts or anything off topic I report them.

"> Reddit works on the upvote/downvote system. It has its flaws, but it's still far different from actual censorship.

Ha, every large subreddit is heavily censored.  You never get to see what mods hide. /r/bitcoin didn't invent css to hide posts, this is the standard feature of the automoderator every subreddit uses.

At any time they can flag you to hide your posts, but the posts are still visible to yourself.  The only way to know is log out or notice that a post that normally would be upvoted or downvoted has neither.  Then logout and check.

Some subreddits hide all posts by default and white list accounts and/or individual posts.  Thus they have control over the community opinion.  Every subreddit can easily be sculpted to make it seem like the community thinks the opposite of what it actually is."

You're missing the analogy here.  No, they don't claim it's debian, they claim it's forked from debian to follow more closely the original vision of the unix way in open source.  In the same way Bitcoin Cash doesn't claim it's 'bitcoin core', it claims it's forked from Bitcoin Core to more closely follow the original vision of Satoshi's whitepaper for what Bitcoin is designed to do.  This conflict is not some deviation from the norm in open source, it's just more intense in this instance because everyone HAS to have an opinion whether it's well informed or not when their money is on the line- and bitcoin wasn't supposed to be a brand, it was supposed to be the name for the first iteration of a technology, so this claim that BCH has been co-opting the name is disingenuous in the first place.
This subreddit was created a long time before Bitcoin Cash got born, to be able to talk freely about bitcoin because many people were getting banned from the bitcoin subreddit for political reasons. The  subreddit owner made clear his intentions of purging 90% of the community if that was necessary to push his agenda. Most old timers left, created this subreddit, and 2 years later are in love again with Bitcoin Cash, because it's the Bitcoin they felt in love the first time.
Because this sub wasn't started specifically to promote BCH, it was started well before to have honest uncensored discussion about bitcoin as a response to the mods in the main sub censoring posts freely without reasonable (or any) justification.  Get your timeline right.
"I don't care what r/bitcoin does or does not allow in their sub. Don't you get it? I couldn't give a hoot about the drama. Concentrate on talking about the tech, the game theory, the economic interests, the societal disruption, the role of legislation, etc etc, but don't drag me into a subreddit pissing match. 

And those tests proved little - any serious peer review would have blown it out the water. They were a demonstration proof of concept, nothing more - so don't start spouting it as proof that the BCH roadmap will work. It's not proof, it is actually far from it. "
"Thanks for the long reply. Even if I don't agree with everything you wrote, I still appreciate the work you spent to write it. $0.50 /u/tippr

I think you are right, calling Lightning an ""alt-chain"" is more accurate than calling it an ""alt-coin"". It reflects the fact that it's a separate system, but still has the economic backing of the original coin.

I don't think that non-mining nodes offer much additional decentralization. In fact, I think that every node on the network creates a *cost* in terms of additional bandwidth and/or message propagation time. Pure nodes hurt the network. That cost is only worthwhile if you have some additional service running on that node, such as mining, merchant services, block explorers, SPV wallet servers, or such. Those services all create real economic activity on the network, justifying their bandwidth usage. Since they all generate economic activity, those services also have ways of making profits, which can easily pay for running a beefy full node. If a full node eventually takes a cluster of machines running in a data center, then that's fine by me. By the time the network has that much usage, there will be *tons* of for-profit businesses happy to pay that price. The problem creates its own solution, and decentralization will remain.

I can't wait for 1GB blocks. Even a simple quad-core server is enough to run a node at this level, and yet the transaction volume will represent a big chunk of the world's economy."
">&gt; But forcing high fees is more harmful.

Why that would make high fees less harmful? This is completely unrelated.

>a natural, and market driven, fee market has emerged in direct response to increased transnational demand on a limited capacity network. 

As I said above, how that would make fees less harmful?

>That was the whole intention of keeping the block limit in place.

Not really small miner get tgeir profitability killed by fees.

High network fees created huge miner centralisation. (Quick calculation show that any fees above $1 seriously impact small miner..)"
"Slow vs Fast.  Cheap vs Expensive. Certain vs uncertain. 

Funny how Bitcoin Core coin(BTC)  performs when the volume of transactions is scaled up. 

As compared to Bitcoin Cash,  for example. "
"Shame on me? LOL ok. 

Bulletproofs don’t do anything for simple transactions. Sharding might, but it is a long way away. 

The gigabyte and terabyte blocks show that today’s technology works. Sure it’s expensive, but we don’t need any giant leaps in tech to make it work. We could jump to 32MB today and be just fine with today’s network though. The fact that there was a huge fight over going to 2MB shows how core devs feel about actual, on-chain scaling.  Simply MENTIONING these tests in r\bitcoin is enough to be banned. I know, because I was banned. So shame on them for destroying a huge lead. "
Except they don't claim it's Debian, refer to it as Debian and shill it on debian.com and @debian on Twitter. Having core principles and sticking to them is fine. I think dissenting opinions are good for furthering a technology, and if people want big blocks or don't want segwit, they're entitled to their own vision. Forks are fine, but when you're the minority fork of a piece of OSS, I think it's unethical to market yourself under the name of a piece of software you forked off of.
"If that's what you want to believe, then fair enough, I can't convince you otherwise. I believe the block size limit was out into place to protect against spam, and then kept in place to ensure a fee market arises to prove the network can stay secure in a post block reward era. 

I have yet to hear of BCH's plan for that post block reward era. "
"So much wrong with what you wrote. Specifically the ""segwit coins are not bitcoin"", and ""segwit coins are not as secure"" bits. Utter nonsense, in my humble opinion.

"
Excellent example. 100 bits /u/tippr 
"That's exactly the point. ""Bitcoin Core"" wasn't forked, Bitcoin was. ""Bitcoin Core"" is an invention made in order to push the agenda of ""Bitcoin Cash"" and no one refers to it as ""Bitcoin Core"" outside of this community.

Forking and following Satoshi's ""vision"" is fine, pretending that it's somehow deserving of the name ""Bitcoin"", is disingenuous at best. "
Bitcoin. Wouldn’t exist without roger ver? Ahahahahaha don’t make me laugh. 
Lends credibility to the sub, to the discussion therein ***maybe***. Lends credibility to the project? Hardly. 
">In reality all that is happening is that they are being batched. 

Yes, the problem is other usage are priced out."
"> The core devs are doing things with MAST and schnorr that help make future, complicated smart contracts cheaper.

They are also doing work on things like Bulletproofs and Sharding.

> They work just fine on Bitcoin Cash though.

Ok, here is the narrative. Ok. Just in case you weren't aware, 1 input and 2 output transactions also work on a host of other cryptos as well, as they do on BTC. Indeed with the higher rate of as fees are drastically reducing on main chain. 

> The gigabyte and terabyte block tests show otherwise.

Ok, so this I have a real problem with, and shame on you for extrapolating the delimited tests done on very large blocks to infer it's a viable development plan for the future. Those tests were done on extremely hypothetical test grounds, where brand new computers were used, all nodes were connected through v.high speed internet, with unlimited bandwidth. All tests were also completed on a network of a maximum of 12 nodes, all in developed cities in developed countries. That is not in any way representative of the real world - unless of course you want developed nations running the monetary system for the rest of the planet. That hierarchy sounds great doesn't it?

> Do you really not see Bitcoin’s fall from nearly 95% of the crypto market cap down to a third as p2p transactions leaving?

Again, shame on you for spewing this narrative here. Bitcoin was never ever going to keep 95% market cap, and you know it. It's ludicrous to think that was possible, and it's dishonest to say otherwise. 
"
"It's one of the properties.

So why post in r/BTC?
"I don't think Roger or Jihan ever wrote a single line of code for bitcoin... so yes bitcoin would exist just the same.

I don't think you put 2 minutes of thinking before opening this thread."
"I guess I should have been more clear. The core devs are doing things with MAST and schnorr that help make future, complicated smart contracts cheaper. They don’t do much of anything for making a simple 1 input, 2 output transaction any cheaper. These types of transactions can cost over $10 now instead of $0.001 and so are no longer feasible with Bitcoin. They work just fine on Bitcoin Cash though. 

Sure, they may allow for cool second layer smart contract systems, but they aren’t actually doing much of anything to help simple transactions. The core devs hope to deprecate the old way of everyone using on-chain transactions and move to a model where everyone is on second (or even third!) layer solutions. They do this because they don’t think that everyone using on-chain can work. The gigabyte and terabyte block tests show otherwise. 

Do you really not see Bitcoin’s fall from nearly 95% of the crypto market cap down to a third as p2p transactions leaving?"
"> A settlement layer only (mostly?) use main chain to set transactions happening on second layers.

That is just it - you are still writing user payments to the chain on the base layer. In reality all that is happening is that they are being batched. "
"Bigger blocks also means more bandwidth. They would have to download that new 1gb block in under 10 min, every ten min or it falls behind and becomes useless to the network. I really like Andreas Antonopoulos [explanation](https://youtu.be/AecPrwqjbGw) on it.

Regardless, his gives me more hope that there will indeed be hundreds of successful cryptos being used in the future seeing we all have different opinions of our money. Also gave the long reply because I know I wouldn't be wasting my time since you have obviously proven you do your homework. Thank you so much for the tip and I wish you luck in your investments. Out of respect, I'm not even considering selling the BCH you gave me but to hodl it. Who knows, could save me when ""the flippening"" happens haha. Take care mate."
"It is always a good laugh to ask troll to back up theirs claim,

"Bitcoin Cash did not have intent...people do. I agree that the creators of Bitcoin Cash would be hypocrytical IF it was their intent to keep Lightining Network and Segwit from being implemented. However, I think the real intent was simply bigger blocks. 

It was made very clear by Blockstream and many of the Core Developers that they wanted small blocks. I actually like the reasons and LukeJr's thoughts on making blocks smaller. However, counter weighing this strategy with the strategy of just making room for more people with larger blocks, I prefer the latter. I want more devs on board that might not be able to afford to play with the live technology otherwise.


And this is not a hypocrytical approach. Bitcoin Cash will never be hypocritical in this way."
"If the proof of concept is fine at 1GB, then we will definitely be fine with 32MB, but yet the core devs act like the sky will come crashing down if we do simple scaling solutions before their more complex solutions are ready.

I actually was part of tests for 8MB on testnet back before the Hong Kong Stalling conference. I bring up the censorship in r\bitcoin because it is relevant. It has done an amazing job at removing all the actual technical discussion which would have led to a simple hardfork YEARS ago that would have done a great job of keeping fees low today. We can worry about block reward being under transaction fees when the reward is smaller. We don’t need to force a fee market today. Forcing the fee market today (and I think forcing it any time), simply moved people to other coins. But when we tried to talk about this with core devs, our comments were deleted.  If you really think you can ignore the toxic community and focus on the tech, you are going to end up with a worthless coin. The best technology pretty much NEVER wins. The best marketed technology is what actually wins. And this drama that you want to ignore matters for that. 

And please share on a technical level what is wrong with the gigabyte and terabyte tests such that they can be “blown out of the water” "
B-Cash is not Bitcoin
The problem with IP is that you have to force people who *aren't* party to any contracts to comply.

"/u/ergofobe said it better than I probably could.

But to be clear, I have absolutely no objection to second layer solutions. I'm a massive fan of Ethereum's Raiden, and I think LN is an excellent idea.

My problem is with the fact that a single company, who's entire business revolves around 2nd layer solutions for cryptocurrency (and even clearly state this), also employ a significant number of the most influential Bitcoin devs, and that those devs, as far as I can tell, are artificially and centrally making decisions to push 2nd layer

I have absolutely no objection to LN being optional. I have a huge objection to artificially limiting the block size to 1MB and forcing people onto 2nd layer because it's the only way to use Bitcoin for a sensible fee. I know, I know, fees have dropped lately: but that's because we're in a bear market currently and people have less interest. And, frankly, I believe a good chunk of that is caused by high fees.

LN is good, but when people are being forced to use it by high fees, that's not competition: that's Blockstream pushing an agenda"
"By making the second layer even better, with more features, than the first layer. You could argue that Counterparty and Omni are second-layer applications. They are used because they offer features that aren't available on the base layer. 

If you want people to move to LN, make it a lot more attractive and useful than the base layer and people will flock to it. Purposefully destroying the first layer with high-fees and congestion isn't the way to make the second layer more attractive, it just makes people hate the people who trashed the first layer."

why do you continue to troll this sub? it's clear as day
So why not post on r/BCH...
He heavily promoted Bitcoin during its early days and invested in many bitcoin startups. He gave away a lot of Bitcoin to Libertarians trying to get them involved and excited.
Ok, that comment of yours explains a lot...
Didn't he give u/Papa_Ganda his first Bitcoin, when he was still a noob.
Also, Mike Hearn gave /u/Papa_Ganda his first own Bitcoin. Think about that.
Is bcash the same as bitcoin cash?
"I read it at least once a week. It's as important as the Declaration of Independence or the U.S. Constitution. What does the whitepaper have to do with the attempt to co-opt and smear BTC on it's own Reddit forum? And don't give me the old ""Muh Satoshi's Vision"" crap. Satoshi wrote about second layer solutions and instituted the block size cap. And don't tell me he didn't mean for it to be permanent either (unless you can include the proof)."

Hitler soft forked the population into nazism (same germany, same chain of aryans), and that was aligned with the original vision of germany but improved by 'true aryans' in the command (racially superior devs). He transformed europe into a german reich settlement layer (Lebensraum für das deutche Volk) and segregated witnesses into concentration camps, out of the main chain (big blocker jews).

All of this with the help of paid partisans who bullied the dissension out of the public opinion (r/bitcoin, twitter, bitcointalk.com) and out of the Reichstag (bitcoin.org and github).

That seems more accurate."
Yes, comparing Bitcoin Core to the Nazi party is a much more level-headed and accurate analogy. 
Where is the code that defines that?
Yeah. There are arguments against all of them. That's my point. Best not to give personalities too much power or sway. Their opinion is their opinion and it doesn't mean more because they were early. The content is important, not the person.

"From the Bitcoin whitepaper:


- ""The majority decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested in it.""


- ""Nodes always consider the longest chain to be the correct one and will keep working on extending it.""


- ""Nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone. They vote with their CPU power, expressing their acceptance of valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on them. Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism""


I see quite a few mentions of the ""longest chain"" and the chain with the most ""CPU power"" being the legitimate chain.  Of the two chains being discussed, which one is longer and has more hash power?"
You have it the fuckin wrong way around. These People wouldnt have the lives they are Living without bitcoin and should be thankfull as fuck. 
"No, but sometimes the most ingenious ideas (and solutions) are also the most elegant and simple. On-chain scaling via block size increases is simple and effective, now and into the foreseeable future.

There is no legitimate reason to keep them at a ridiculous 1MB - none, zero, not a single fucking one. 

They're doing it on behalf of the banks and those who fund them. Why? To prevent BTC from becoming a USEFUL, day to day, *peer-to-peer* transactional currency. Full stop. 

Or barring that, at least forestall it long enough to install some overcomplicated, messy, and *completely unnecessary* 2nd layer scaling solutions that THEY can control - and of course, profit from, as they always have in the pre-crypto world.

"See: Devuan, a distro that forked from Debian specifically to maintain SysV as its init system because they felt systemd's design and implementation philosophy violates early unix and linux community principles.  Critics of Systemd are quite vocal that they feel it doesn't follow ""the unix way"", which is a perfectly appropriate analog.

So yes, this absolutely happens all the time in open source, and the users voice their opinions by using the one they like more."
The bullshit surrounding it includes artificially limiting the block size to force people into using it... and I object to that
“BitCoin”
Of course, it would exist without them. There are many important people in the space but the only person Bitcoin brand couldn't exist without is Satoshi Nakamoto.
*trying to hijack*.
Big claims need big proofs.
"""BCH community"" sounds so ghay.  What community?  Bitcoin doesn't need a community, it needs adopters or users.  We don't say there is a credit card community or an Australian dollar community.  Less tribalism."
"I just call them BTC and BCH. Everyone seems to understand what I'm talking about and it is pretty non controversial so you don't waste time arguing semantics. Blocksize has the same issue as segwit. If you don't want to call it ""Bitcoin"", ""Bitcoin Core"" is probably the best of those. It seems the most common alternative by my anecdotal observations. Not drowning new people in lots of names for the same thing seems pretty important."
"No I don't agree with you. Bitcoin core is not an adequate description. That's like saying parity when you actually meant to say ethereum. One is a currency, the other is an implementation of the protocol.

Segwit is not an attack. It's a voluntary extension to the protocol. Or at least it was until the NYA was signed."
"People call Ubuntu and Mint ""Linux.""

I am open to change. Bitcoin Blockstream? Bitcoin Small Blocks? Bitcoin Core? Suggestions and reasoning?
"This particular instantiation of me upvoted your comment and replied, but another just upvoted and moved along. Boom, he's now in the new USA. 

Or am I? 

Shit, my brain..."
"> But instead your trying to convince people that you’re actually bitcoin core. Hijacking. 

If Bitcoin Cash is Hijacking, then Bitcoin SegWit is also hijacking. 

Both are forks technically, while Bitcoin Cash is following the original vision of Satoshi. Bitcoin SegWit is not.

Therefore, Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin and Bitcoin SegWit is shit."
"I guarantee no one here is masquerading as or even _wants to be_ bitcoin core.  the title clearly differentiates between ""core"", ""BCH"", and the ""bitcoin brand"".  there is no confusion or deception."
"He played big role in Bitcoin history. He is first investor in this space and bootstrapped many companies, paid adds, speak on conferences etc.

Why do you and other Core supporters don’t miss chance to personally offend that guy?"
"Consensus.

Edit:  Think of it this way, say there was an update that was better and the majority decided to follow an updated fork.  The only difference was some kind of un-contentious update.  Say after a couple of clever people buy up the old fork before the update and say no this is now the real bitcoin.  Technically, it is the truer version since it came before an update...it's more...original.  I'm not saying this is at all equivalent to bitcoin cash since that was contentious.  I'm just saying what the majority go with likely determines what keeps the name.  Otherwise technically Etherium classic should be called Etherium.  "
That's because the wallet is named bitcoin core. But the name of the repository on github still is bitcoin.
You know what makes something look successful? When all they do is bitch about their more successful competition.
"> Purposefully destroying the first layer with high-fees and congestion isn't the way to make the second layer more attractive, it just makes people hate the people who trashed the first layer.

They didn't purposely destroy it. It's working alright. Expensive and slow, but still working. As well as being the most secure network from corporations and, most importantly state - which is what should be its main attraction (as that was the reason for Bitcoin in the first place). "
"Thank you! Unfortunately 95% of BTC users don't really understand what open source software means, or more specifically, the BSD liscence Bitcoin has (THANK GOD!). 

""Unauthorized"" forks are the name of the game - its 100% OK (and encouraged!). Seems like 75% of users are under the impression that this is somehow closed source software, and that the code is ""owned"" like a patent. 

Gosh people need to pull their heads out of their asses for two seconds and take breath of fresh air."
B..but Roger disires LN also so that make BTrash a settlement layer...oh wait..
">Hard forks were everyone follows the chain like in the three above examples are not creating an altcoin. 


Funny to see small blocker changing their tunes about HF.

Would have been better if you did before the split but hey..

>The BCC HF in October where most of the community chose not to follow it is an altcoin. 

This is all semantics, the BCH split happened because the segwit soft fork was imposed on the community.

So we are in the situation of a soft fork change the currency characteristics, and part of the community split to recover the original characteristics/design.

What gives? How come the fork trying to recover the original characteristics is a fork and the one radically changing it is somehow not an Altcoin?

Why using coercive upgrade should give you guys any legitimacy??"
Hmm. I didn't know that. It seems so unnecessary.
The reason I like Bitcoin Cash is not because it doesn't have Segwit or Lightning. I prefer Bitcoin Cash because I can share it among friends without getting killed on fees. Also, so that programmers that are young and broke, or living in 3rd world countries, can easily access it. The biggest pinch in the pipeline is the lack of people. Bitcoin Cash breaks through this barier better than any other crypto. There are tons of speculators out there, and then there are people that use it.
