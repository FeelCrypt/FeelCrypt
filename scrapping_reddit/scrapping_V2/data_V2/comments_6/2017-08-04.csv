"More transactions on chain is likely to mean more users on chain. I'm not sure where's the tipping point between more/less nodes, but I'm pretty sure it's not at 1MB.

SegWit is more wasteful of bandwidth than a simple blocksize increase and will require costlier nodes for the same throughput."

Makes sense.
How could anyone think this sub is censored though?
Because people on the other side are noobs and idiots living in a censored bubble and don't know what has happened.
The entire point of the graphic is to falsely equate the two sides when they are not comparable.
makes sense. but for the time being 4/8mb blocks should be more then enough. also technology gets better all the time...
Pepes?
Both for now. Bitcoin Cash is more of the direction I thought Bitcoin would go in the first place. But I also like Segwit. Segwit8x would have been a nice option....

 that's douchey but I respect the play. I will do the same 
"I'm thinking more like the Clone Wars in the Star Wars triology.  There war is apparently between Palpatine (the chancellor of the republic) and Count Dooku (the funder of the separatists) - in reality Dooku is the servant of Palpatine, and there wouldn't be any war if it wasn't for Palpatine and Dooku deliberately pitching the sides against each other.  Who knows, maybe there is one person or agency deliberately pitching the sides against each other?

I don't know much about US politics ... but there is at least one striking resemblance - there is far too much ad-hominem and too much focus on the negative things in the debate.  As for the Bitcoin schism, my opinion is that most bitcoiners want the same: a healthy and thriving bitcoin ecosystem - on the question ""how is it best to get there"", the biggest issue is really whom to trust - and hence all the mud slinging.

In the US presidental election, any third candidate has no chance, everyone knows it's a waste of voting power to vote for a third candidate.  I may be very wrong about it, but my impression is that in the last election, a majority of the voters would have voted ""none of those two candidates"" if that would have been an option - must voters voted to avoid the worst of the two candidates to become president.  In such an environment it may be mudslinging and ad-hominem can be the best tactic for collecting votes.

If it would have been a more fair election with many candidates and the winner being chosen i.e. by a [runoff voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-round_system), some [Condorcet method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method) or similar, then it would have been more profitable for the candidate to explain and argue for his political visions rather than to bash the opponents.

Perhaps Bitcoin has been victim of the same.  It is my impression that in 2015 there was very few (possibly except Todd and Luke) that was outright opposing the idea of raising the block size limit.  It was the natural way for Bitcoin to go.  BIP-100 was supported by a majority of miners.  In retro perspective, we'd probably have 2 MB or 8 MB blocks a year ago if the XT/BIP-101-clan would have dropped their proposal and supported BIP-100.  It's a bit ironic that the arguments used by the XT folks against BIP-100 was that it would give too much control to the miners.  Today it's the small blockers who don't want to give too much control to the miners ...

(Arguably back then - when the full block had to be relayed over the network before competing miners could start mining on the next block - even 1 MB was actually a bit too large).

obviously not but you seem like you can suck a mean cock. 
I think you are thinking of one core developer in particular. Luke Dashjr has some very questionable points of view, both in Bitcoin and in other parts of life. Most core devs are perfectly reasonable.
Also note that the people doing the censoring are not the same people writing the code.
His mom took over once he broke his arms....
That's not asian. That's an abomination!
Yah I seem to recall that too, hundreds of thousands of BTC. 
"I remember one time I was in a small-ish sub and over the course of 2 or three days I kept seeing this one thing mentioned. Over and over in almost every topic someone would mention it and it really caught my attention. Something must be going on that I have to pay attention if everyone is mentioning this.

I did some research myself and found nothing interesting at all, so I went back to verify and that's when I realized. Every single post I had seen was by the same user. 

Unless people pay attention to usernames it's very easy to create the illusion of an echo chamber just by pushing the same thought over and over. "
everything has its price
Then why don't those people call out the censorship?  If the censors are aligned to their point of view, they look like allies.  If the Core devs don't believe in censorship, they should call it out. 
Install reddit enhancement suite and start tagging people. You'll be amazed to find it's the same handful of trolls all over reddit pushing the same tired narratives.
As they say, $20 is $20.
I believe some have, but once again, I think you are overestimating the censorship. The only things I have seen cendored are posts about altcoins and intentionally inflammatory posts. As a general rule about alternative clients (that could cause a chainsplit), technical discussion is ok, promotion is not.
True, you gotta get in to get out
It's like 90% drama, I'm baffled at how you're able to manage this.  Do you have a script or something?
"I'm glad. I've gone back and forth several times myself. For me, the side with censorship has a _massive_ bias to overcome. If I hear that Side A is actively censoring Side B, I assign weights like +10 to Side B and -10 to Side A as a starting point. 

Aside from censorship, the Core team constantly advances questionable points of view demonstrating economic ignorance e.g. the usage of Bitcoin is ""spam"".

The technical ability of the Core team is definitely their strength. If they would climb down from their ivory tower, admit they need to learn some economics, stop their censorship campaign, stop saying things like ""all hard forks are bad"" or ""we should reduce the block size to 300KB"", then I think me and a lot of others could start to listen. "
mr are you homo?
I think many people, including myself, have been exposed to a non censored point of view, but find that point of view lacking. That is not to say that I approve of censorship, but that doesn't invalidate opinions on /r/Bitcoin, it just means you have to look elsewhere work the other side of the story. Also, I would speculate that /r/Bitcoin is not as censored as you might think. Having spent a lot of time reading both subreddits, I fully support SegWit.
"I definitely agree with this, but in trying to sync a Bitcoin Cash node from scratch before the hardfork I found that it took me days. Now, it's been that way for a while, but I haven't dealt with a full node for quite a while, so I'd basically forgotten about that.

I still think more on-chain capacity is better than less, but it gives me a little more sympathy for the argument that it'll drive out nodes."
Absolutely.
"What SegWit does, is just move the witness data from the transaction section of the block, to it's own section. The reasons for this are: 

* So we can validate the witness data, by putting a hash in the header (we can't currently)
* So we can give the witness data a lower weight in the block size, because it's deleted anyway

The bandwidth will be the same as a regular block size increase, and the storage will be more efficient. This also fixes transaction malleability. There's really no reason not to implement SegWit. SegWit isn't enough though. In my opinion we should have all done SegWit8x."
Sharding.

Incorrect, next fork happens in November, that's slightly more than 80 days. :D
The counter-argument for that is that it's obviously easier to hardfork when your network is much more centralized with only a small handful of nodes.
"Interesting, that suggests that there is a majority of users on both subs who at least acknowledge the other sub's viewpoint (and I might suggest that they are open to productive discussions), while a minority of users are effectively causing hostility and shutting down any discussions which might otherwise be productive.

"**Two-round system**

The two-round system (also known as the second ballot, runoff voting or ballotage) is a voting method used to elect a single winner, where the voter casts a single vote for their chosen candidate. However, if no candidate receives the required number of votes, then those candidates having less than a certain proportion of the votes, or all but the two candidates receiving the most votes, are eliminated, and a second round of voting is held.

The two-round system is used around the world for the election of legislative bodies and directly elected presidents. For example, it is used in French presidential, legislative, and departmental elections.

***

**Condorcet method**

A Condorcet method (English: ) is any election method that elects the candidate that would win a majority of the vote in all of the head-to-head elections against each of the other candidates, whenever there is such a candidate. A candidate with this property is called the Condorcet winner. Voting methods that always elect the Condorcet winner, when one exists, satisfy the Condorcet criterion.

A Condorcet winner does not always exist in every election because the preference of a group of voters selecting from more than two options can be cyclic‚Äîthat is, for each candidate it might be possible to select an opponent where the opponent would win a majority of the votes.

"This is nothing but propaganda. /r/btc is not morally equal to /r/bitcoin. This image makes both look as bad as the other. It's a classic strategy of the oppressors. Make the victim equal to the oppressed because you can't justify the oppression of the oppressor, so accuse the oppressed of doing the same bad things.

BTW the henchmen are wrong. Andreas is not entirely on their side - another piece of propaganda. Where are Mow, Luke and Todd?

And most importantly r/BTC does not censor."
The only thing I see wrong here is the censorship on r/btc.  That's simply not true.  Also no segwit doesn't make thing more expensive

The narrative about Roger and the rest was completely invented only a few months ago when they switched sides late into this whole thing. So the right side of that graphic is utter bullshit with a timeline of a few months and makes no sense in light of how long blockstream/core has been attacking Bitcoin.  The time line for blockstream/core being evil goes back years and includes their attacking and removing Gavin, chasing off Mike, etc. 

In short, just because there are two sides to a story doesn't mean the two sides are comparable or worthy of equal consideration. "

"I almost found it funny, except for the fact that it's attempting to make both subs seem equal, which they very much are not. It's attempting to use humor to covertly equalize the subs. Very clever technique actually.

Some of those points are generated lies by r/bitcoin. Two specific examples:

* There are no paid shills from r/btc. I would put money on it being the case for r/bitcoin.

* Roger is not evil. He has helped Bitcoin adoption more than anyone I know in the bitcoin space. He seems generally good-natured.

* Jihan Wu is a miner. He does his job. He is also a good person. There have been lies spread about both Roger and Jihan, again emanating from r/bitcoin.

It's not a double-edged sword despite this attempt to make it seem that way.

The size of the inter-Bitcoins market, the complexity and confusion ensuing makes pretty much everything unmanageable for the ""ordinary person"". Hedge funds and banks (the ones a little ahead of using Excel) that trade in this murky complexity make a killing and become the principal driver of economic growth worldwide. Not only is the consumer about as screwed as is currently the case, but to everyone's benefit he has just been clearly proven yet again that revolt = being fucked in the ass harder, longer, with a thicker implement with sharper barbs on it. Also conveniently, the thing to revolt at has become much more vague and intangible.

I'll probably code the server with C++ (Nail, meet hammer..), I know at least how to make it concurrent. But I bet there's a language already out there that would do that for me.

It's very helpful to use this kind of positive, user-oriented terminology to highlight the features & benefits of [**Bitcoin Cash**](https://bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf) (BCH, or BCC).

"That sounds exciting, good luck with it!

The standard libraries in Go are really, really accommodating. And compile times are really nice. And though the concurrency model leaves a bit to be desired, it's decent enough to get the job done. 

I only use Go because that's the primary language used at the startup I'm at. When it's up to me entirely, I don't really prefer Golang at all."

"> But one of the biggest issues I have with segwit is the way it's implemented. Segwit starts off by assuming that hard-forking Bitcoin is impossible. The claim is just that it's ""too hard"" or ""impractical,"" but these claims aren't generally backed up. Segwit therefore bends over backwards to implement itself as a soft-fork, which means that old bitcoin wallets will still work, but won't understand the new features. But the astute reader will recall that segwit fundamentally alters the structure of blocks and transactions -- so how can this possibly be done as a soft-fork?

> The answer is that segwit uses what is, in my professional opinion, an unthinkably nasty hack: according to the Bitcoin protocol, all segwit transactions can be spent by anybody with no proof of authorization. That means that literally anyone can make a transaction that spends the bitcoins in a segwit address. The ""witness data"" (which is the rules for who's allowed to claim the outputs, and the proof that the rules were followed on the inputs that claim the outputs) is moved out of the main block and replaced with a simple ""anyone can spend me, there are no rules and no proofs,"" and it's up to miners to know what the rules really are, ignore the ""anyone can spend me"" instruction, and instead apply the rules from the witness data.

> There are two major implications to this hack. The first is that segwit is a one-way ticket: once it starts, it can never be removed because to remove the (insanely complicated) segwit rules that say ""Ignore what the transaction says and look at the witness data instead"" would leave only the ""anyone can spend me without any authorization"" rule on all segwit balances. Thus anyone could steal all the coins in segwit balances. To remove segwit, it would either be necessary to keep the (insanely complicated) rules in play, but disallow new transactions to use them, or convince all Bitcoin users to first move their bitcoins to a non-segwit balance. The first isn't really removing segwit, since its rules would still be in use, and the second is simply not going to happen since segwit proponents will lie and censor (just like they're doing now to promote segwit) to scare people away from leaving it behind.

> The second implication is even more chilling: for the first time, the Bitcoin protocol will have official support for theft of bitcoins. See, the formal rules of bitcoin will be ""anyone can spend these coins without authorization,"" but the segwit rules will say otherwise. This means that anyone who can get a majority of miners to agree to look the other way (i.e. ignore the segwit rules) can send a transaction that spends those bitcoins without authorization, and it will be valid by protocol. At present, if the majority of miners attempted to do this, their blocks would be invalid (and ignored by the network) because they violate the Bitcoin protocol, but with segwit, the Bitcoin protocol will only understand ""anyone can spend these coins"" so as long as the miners agree to ignore the segwit rules, the transaction will pass checks. Obviously this means that the miners could collude to steal everyone's segwit balances, but more likely, a government could force mining organizations to allow their transactions to steal bitcoins, reverse transactions, or whatever else. Whereas previously this meddling would've been extremely noisy, causing a hard fork (which would have likely been ignored). With segwit, however, theft by miner collusion is a first class feature.

Ask yourself why it actually matters. AsicBoost is the free market finding innovative solutions just as Bitcoin was originally designed.

"> The impact of any single vulnerability is diminished on a diverse network. Any attacker would need to exploit multiple 0 day vectors to take down the entire system.

Kk yeah I was thinking something along those lines (I'm a bit fuzzy on the technical details). It could also just be a really low fee transaction, not necessarily feeless.
"I am aware that the LTC segwit deployment went smoothly. That is no guarantee it will also happen for Bitcoin.

If the majority of the hash-power is simply signalling segwit to avoid being ignored, but not actually validating the data, there could be problems."
The miners only caring about money is literally what drives Bitcoin. It is *designed* to incentivize miners to only care about money. What is the problem with that?
">You're talking about a hypothetical bug as if you already know exactly how it works.

If they are implementation specific the bugs will affect only the implementation users not the whole network.

>There are many hypothetical bugs that can affect the interoperability between a pair of clients. If there are n distinct clients, the number of distinct pairs of clients grows as O(n^(2)).

And with diferent independent implementation you reduce the number of potential O(n^(2)) bugs."
"My biggest frustration in this debate is that many build arguments against Segwit that are seemingly based on looking at the network from only the perspective of a legacy node that is not Segwit capable and refuses to upgrade. 

It's this forced narrow perspective that leads them to make weird claims involving the ""main chain"" or ""main block"" that actually refer to to the ""stripped block"" served up to the single digit % of nodes which are not Segwit capable, and build hypothesis that ignore the other +90% of network nodes, the existence of honest miners running Segwit software, etc... 


>The ""witness data"" (which is the rules for who's allowed to claim the outputs, and the proof that the rules were followed on the inputs that claim the outputs) is moved out of the main block and replaced with a simple ""anyone can spend me, there are no rules and no proofs,"" and it's up to miners to know what the rules really are, ignore the ""anyone can spend me"" instruction, and instead apply the rules from the witness data.

In reality the signature data is still in the main block / chain, clearly visible in the raw hex data as a part of each transaction. There is no separate ""extension block"" structure that holds only signature data.

Miners receive whole transactions and blocks, they don't interact with the ""stripped blocks"" nodes create and serve up to fool legacy non-mining nodes. 



>This means that anyone who can get a majority of miners to agree to look the other way (i.e. ignore the segwit rules) can send a transaction that spends those bitcoins without authorization, and it will be valid by protocol. At present, if the majority of miners attempted to do this, their blocks would be invalid (and ignored by the network) because they violate the Bitcoin protocol, but with segwit, the Bitcoin protocol will only understand ""anyone can spend these coins"" so as long as the miners agree to ignore the segwit rules, the transaction will pass checks

And of course, this hypothesis ignores the fact that every single 0.13.1 and newer node will immediately reject such transactions & any blocks / chain that contain them as invalid. 

Miners running Segwit-compatible software will ignore the blocks and continue working on the valid chain which the nodes will follow, since they are incapable of following the thieving chain. 

To actually spend ""anyone can spend"" coins without authorization results in a hard fork of the chain, one that all Segwit software is entirely incapable of following regardless of chain length. 

The attack is near meaningless unless the community switches client software to follow the thief's forked chain and accepts it as Bitcoin, and businesses & exchanges will never adopt a chain fork whose primary goal is to steal people's coins. "

They have to adjust their entire site and systems to support the two currencies now. That may require some large architectural, DB, backend and frontend code changes. 5 months is probably a fair estimate.

I get you guys aren't happy that most people aren't supportive of your new coin, but please stick to the fucking facts and logic."
For the purposes of BCH, this would not be a fractional reserve, as funds held via margin will not receive BCH.

Those words are a bit open to interpretation. GDAX is a separate trading platform, so I take it that's what they mean by trading.

That's classic confirmation bias.  A minority of people will be careless, and yes someone will have to deal with that, but any technology has growing pains.

> It's a big barrier to mainstream adoption. I know many don't care about mainstream adoption, but I do.

I think a lot of people care about mainstream adoption. Do you know what else is a big barrier? Having a tiny amount of transaction space and skyrocketing transaction fees.  Sure this fork has created some problems, but it's an attempt to solve some others in the process (it wasn't done for no reason) - and the problems it's creating (some labelling confusion, in a community that is already highly engaged and adaptable to be using such a fringe and unwieldy technology in the first place) are far smaller than the ones its solving (transaction capacity, social conventions around hard forks).

Don't dismiss everyone else as not caring for Bitcoin when really they just have their priorities of how to go about growing it determined differently.

Coinbase didn't add Ethereum until quite a while after the DAO fork which created Ethereum Classic, so there was never a reason for them to have to support it. 
"Yes but that exchange does not support said split.

When a stock splits then the stock exchange gives you (say) twice the amount of stocks. But if you happen to have your money on a different stock exchange  that (somehow) does not recognize the split, then you get nothing *unless* you remove your stocks from said exchange...

The only reason that things like that *can* happen on the crypto world is because it is still wild ... doesn't mean that those things (that don't typically happen in the rest of the world anymore) are illegal..."

"> Zero, they're not running a fractional reserve. 

Margin (like they offer) can effectively be a fractional reserve, even if margin calls and short-term terms mean that the funds are safe."
Or it could cost them millions if they get it wrong. 5 months certainly sounds excessive, and probably is a concession to bcore partisans--holding off as long as they can basically.

cmon brah. just wait and see man. ETC didnt die and BCH won't either. just dont know where we will be in 5 months tho. imagine BCH becoming $3k? time to have a stripper pool party. ur invited...
Is that bCash?
Bah..... sorry, miscommunication.  I sold my shit the day before not moved them.  If they wouldn't have said they were going to disregard  Bitcoin Cash, I'd have left my shit alone.  All the bickering and name calling, etc. concerned me.  I bailed on my BTC when I shouldn't have.
Well, they have two different names, for starters.  Additionally, there is nothing to suggest that Coinbase will do anything other than allow only customers who held Bitcoin during the fork to be able to continuing storing their BCC with Coinbase or withdrawal their BCC.  Nothing in the statement suggests that Coinbase will feature BCC, allow buying and selling of BCC, or if display it to customers that did not have BTC during the fork.
"I don't get the vitriol. They said *days* before the split was to happen that they won't support it. 

I only had a few mBTC but it was ample time for me to transfer it to a diff exchange (one that credited BCH in a few hours).

It's quite obvious that they want to see the BCH crashing out of existence. Even that move of theirs was/is calculated in the sense that they create the circumstances of a cautious market.

I can't see how any lawsuit can stand against them. If anything they over-delivered (they didn't have to release the funds not in 5 months, not ever, legally speaking, given how much time they gave to their customers to take their funds away).

As for BCH supporters it's quite obvious that Coinbase is not for you, what the heck are you doing there. If I supported the future of a particular crypto-currency I would had stayed the hell away from any Exchange that doesn't support it. It's obvious that it is in their best interests to crash it, so stay away..."
Kind of inevitable in my view. You can't ignore it.
"1) Well no shit.  We all knew they would come aorund because otherwise they are leaving easy money on the table.

2) Huzzah!"
5 months is an eternity in crypto. It is very possible that the delay at Coinbase will keep some customers from dumping BCC for a few hundred dollars when waiting lets the price rise to thousands.
Coinbase. The boat. It's over there. You missed it.

big shout out to all the people who complained and even attorneys who have clearly stated class action lawsuit threats. wow.

lets all release a HUGE sigh of relief. maybe even nut all over yourself while youre at it..."
What takes 5 months is that they're one of the only exchanges that has all their cold storage coins insured.  But you can bet that the only way they managed to get insurance was to promise that they stay cold, and pretty obviously the safest way to claim Bitcoin cash requires that they move all their cold stored coins to avoid replay risks.  If they don't want to move their cold stored coins then they need to analyze the Bitcoin Cash client they're using to ensure that there's no risk of either getting their keys stolen or any bugs that may cause replay risk (i.e. the transactions must always be in the new format)
Bitcoin Cash withdrawals taking 5 months appears slow even when compared with Bitcoin withdrawals taking 12 hours.
"Two Words: Fractional Reserve
"
so does this mean you just got free money if you had bitcoin before the split? like if you had 10 bitcoions ($27000), do you now have 10 bitcoins ($27000) AND 10 bitcoin cash ($4000)? Making you instantly $4000 richer?
That is when the real dumpening will come.

Actually a very legit concern. He mentions how accurate is their book keeping / snapshot of the values in everyone's account when the fork happened. What about gdax and stuff "
When Ethereum Classic hit the markets Coinbase did the same, ignoring it first, then giving in, however it turned out because of missing replay protection (thanks to vitalik) Coinbase had to buy back ETC on other markets first. Feel free to draw your conclusions based on this information.
"You guys should thank Coinbase right now. If it wasn't for them, you would have sold your Bitcoin Cash and regretted that decision at the day of January 1st. If Bitcoin Cash truly has potential it should easily make it past 5 months and Coinbase is going to cough up a lot of value.

Also good to know they didn't just steal it and sell it off thinking Bitcoin Cash was gonna die in hours. If they did... holy shit."
Appears they want to see what happens in November.  I think we all know what is going to happen, the 2mb will fail and everyone will rush to Bitcoin Cash.
"My guess is that this is caused by scaling issues.  They are obviously having trouble keeping up with ""normal"" business.

"Finally, someone puts some sanity in all this.

Core has 4 moths for implant LN"
"**Question** Is there an alert or app to tell me of a new Block from BitcoinCash?

how about widgets for price, or even tradingview of HitBTC?"
[deleted]
"Well, that's great fuckin' news. As I never transferred out. If BCH takes off, then atleast at some point I can 1:1 exchange them. That is the hope. With CoinBase you're never sure. Their forward prospect and answers are very delayed, and short.

.... and January 2018? Fuck off, CoinBase."
"This is misleading.  They are allowing BTC users to withdraw BCC they are entitled to.  They are not ""supporting"" BCC.  Let's just be clear on that."
That means Coinbase will support BCC if SW2X fails.
Wow. Some recognition. What the fuck is happening?
[deleted]
"I would like to second your LOL

I mean yeah, obviously this is great for coinbase users.  But what in the fuck?  I split my coins in about 4 minutes.  Bittrex did it in 2 days.  Is there a word that means ""excessively excessive?"""
"That's why you are the CEO of a major crypto exchange huh?

They are going to let the hashing power grow to match the value of the coin first to prevent against 51% attacks. Everyone screaming that coinbase should have immediately supported it is stupid. 

They should have been clearer about their intentions to support Bitcoin cash but there is no need to rush an untested implementation. Shit needs to be tested before it goes to production. 

Especially when you are responsible for millions of customer dollars. "
"Hopefully working on getting Cash into the real economy - e.g. merchant invoices listening on both chains and auto-selling across to the merchants' selected receive currency; informing merchants to choose if they want Cash or a settlement coin, etc."
You can always expect a shitshow if there's huge money involved. People were'nt going to lose 300-600 dollars per coin gracefully
Dude it's the damn opposite of good news. This literally means that 100,000+ BCH will flood the market in 5 months most likely keeping price down to the floor until then. 
Omg lmfao 
"It is, but that's between the customers and the exchange.  I've had coinbase wire payments (from me to them) take nearly two months before I had to threaten to call the police and they returned my funds.
"
Lol, why the fk would they encourage to withdraw if they were doing that? No fking logic to those who accuse coinbase of fractional reserve 
[deleted]
More words: oh shit we have to go buy a bunch of this shit like we did with ETC oh shit we are fucked oh shit somebody pass the bath salts fuck somebody call john mcafee
I never been their customers in the first place never had anything to remove. Some of my friends, on the other hand, against my advice, just could not stay away and still have their bitcoins locked up there until January 2018 reportedly.
It's not easy to implement, there are more changes to the code than it might appear on the surface.
"I don't think they're adding it as something you can buy through Coinbase, or trade on GDAX. They're simply issuing some to those who stored BTC with them prior to August 1st.

A lot can change in five months, though, so who knows?"
How are people able to handle the difference between US and Canadian dollars? They're both dollars but different?! What does it meeeaaaan, my poor brain! /s
Consumers don't care. All they care about is how much fiat they have.
Concern troll.
Please keep going! I want to see for how long the bot will correct you
The confusion is/was completely intentional, hence the extremely similar name and logo.
"> I've seen no indication that any NYA miners plan to drop support for the hardfork portion of the agreement. 

I've seen indications that Adam Back will go totally batshit.

As usual."
Yeah, it's clearly easy as fuck to implement. Something is sketchy. 
So they're dicks because now you don't have to wait 5 months to use your Bitcoin Cash?
What's bcash? The announcement is about Bitcoin Cash. 
Watch out for naphthalene! 
"Their email to me (and blog post, which is identical) said:

> We are planning to have support for bitcoin cash by January 1, 2018, assuming no additional risks emerge during that time.

""By Jan 1"" is not the same as ""On Jan 1"".  They may be ready quite a bit sooner.  

Note that Coinbase has to have the funds in place in case a lot of people want to cash out their BCC or trade for other currencies they handle.  There also has to be enough liquidity in the market if people want to buy a lot.  It's not just adding a new line item to their wallets page.  It is being prepared for a first-day rush.

If it was me, I would probably put an initial limit on BCC transactions, so the ""first day rush"" is spread out.  Once the initial rush is over and trading settles to a pattern, they can remove the limit."
">will likely cause a large dump.

Why? There are always two sides to a market. I read this news as *extremely* bullish. Coinbase by far has the most influence of any Bitcoin business, more so than even MtGox because the market is larger and more advanced.

Adding Bitcoin Cash legitimizes and cements it as a top-tier coin. It will make headlines and generate new discussion. Casual users will learn what Bitcoin Cash represents and why it came about. The market can more accurately assess which coins make sense to hold longer-term."
This is good, this is a a forced hodl..... Better give it to them as late as possible imo
Had Coinbase originally ramped up for this, all those coins would've hit the market anyhow. Now BCC has five months to find its footing before it happens, and no doubt the market is going to price that dump into its action long before. Seems like a good thing. 
I don't get everyone saying people will dump their bcc. Why? If btc went up the equivalent ~8%, would people dump btc?
No, they specifically said they have not committed to allowing trading or supporting it on the exchange. They will simply give users access to it.
I've seen no indication that any NYA miners plan to drop support for the hardfork portion of the agreement. If things stay as they are, the SegWit2x hardfork will still happen with a super-majority of hashpower support.
I totally agree. This is very bullish for Bitcoin Cash. It keeps the thought on the project much alive for the coming months, while not flooding the market right now. Absolutley brilliant passive marketing.
"They don't even want to talk about it much. Most of them are probably biting their lips waiting for the big ""crash"" of Bitcoin Cash. 

Have fun waiting, boys."
they need to grow some new potatoes to feed their programmers to give them energy to code it.
If you really couldn't be damned to remove your coins before the fork I don't know what you expected. Don't leave your coins in someone else's hands.
Coinbase is trying to manipulate the market, no question about it. But I wonder if this manipulation could favor Bitcoin Cash. Retail investors can't easily dump their BCH coins right now, and sentiment could change if BCH gains legs before this year is out, especially if (nah, WHEN) the 2x part of Segwit2x fails to be delivered in November.
"CoinbaseUser: we don't give a shit about you.

All we give a shit about is making sure anybody who competes with us on user experience is locked up like that guy we think has something to do with BTC-e.  This way we can keep fucking you over while shouting ""KYC! KYC!"".

Sincerely,

FuckBase


"
Doesn't seem like they will list it at that point, they will just credit it to owners. 
Probably no Christmas shopping with Coinbase.
:) it is pretty funny about BCash 
I don't have remotely enough free space for it. 
All I can say is: persevere. Also, I found out after trying many things that closing the program and opening again every hour or so would improve the transfer rate a lot ‚Äì for a while. Then it would creep down to 1%/hour again, so I would repeat. I think what happens is that you connect to a whole new set of peers, and that helps (?). I'm not sure. I'm done now, and have mostly ABC nodes connected to me :)
"That's why we should keep bitcoin to just the coin base transaction and 1 transaction to the lucky winner to actually settle out their LN channel.

All of the other peasants get to keep their custodial accounts at the crypto banks where everything is monitored, censored, and tracked. Good day citizen.

Now getting away from you fucking zombie drones, without any independent critical thought....

....we can do checkpoints or use extention blocks to remove meaningless transactions (no UTXOs)   "
But as our technology gets better over time we will be able to process that faster. Moore's law is not dead
It's not called bcash. You know that. ‚òÆÔ∏è
"I think you‚Äôre over complicating this (the processing time part). This is a software problem. There‚Äôs no reason why the client needs to download the blocks one by one, it could very easily download large batches and run multiple verification threads in parallel, and then stitch them together. At some points I was downloading at over 10%/hour, and at that pace I would be done in less than half a day, and even then I was barely using half my bandwidth.

People and companies who desire could run nodes with a standardized (BIP‚Äôed) service that provides large amounts of blocks at once. You‚Äôd still verify the blocks, but you wouldn‚Äôt have to wait for them to be downloaded one by one.

I guess the cause of my slowdown were two: few nodes in the network (forcing me to download from a handful of nodes at a time), and stagnated scale development (old code which was more suitable for a much smaller blockchain).

Now the storage part, that‚Äôs less of a software problem and more of a technology problem. However, I was able to compress some block files and save 30% in space. Since we know which file contains each bunch of blocks, nothing stops the software from compressing the files as much as possible, and then unpacking them when a verification is needed.

tldr: these are not unsolvable problems. We just need developers who are more interested in tackling the scaling problem rather than maintaining their status-quo."
Only some of those would get on each block.
"""But if the rate of increase is faster than moore's law you are still going to have a problem""

Problem? You mean situation that will encourage innovation?

""normal people will stop running nodes""

Correct, normal people are not supposed to be running nodes. That is what SPV is for. This is outlined in the white paper. 

"
"From the Wikipedia page about Moore's Law:


""Advancements in digital electronics are strongly linked to Moore's law: quality-adjusted microprocessor prices,[11] memory capacity, sensors and even the number and size of pixels in digital cameras.[12] Digital electronics has contributed to world economic growth in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries.[13] Moore's law describes a driving force of technological and social change, productivity, and economic growth.[14][15][16][17]""

As you can see Moore's Law is a concept that applies to many things other than processing power. 

And even if you for some reason choose not to refer to it as Moore's Law, there is no way around the fact that bandwith capacity has grown at EXTREME rate and continues to grow so whatever you call it, it's improving incredibly fast."
"That's why the official stance here is that fullnodes don't even matter anyway!

They truly seem to believe that as virtually all bcash nodes are quickly spun up zombies on AWS & co.

Mining landscape looks equally bad.

What exactly do you need proof of work for?"
"Completely disagree with that, anyone that has been steadily buying hardware the past few years knows they indeed have improved. 

If Moore's Law is dead then how come they're working on 1nm transistors? People that say Moore's law is dead think the smallest is 5nm. Well there is actually a two and they're working on a one: 

http://newscenter.lbl.gov/2016/10/06/smallest-transistor-1-nm-gate/
"
I mean, if it works then it works right? 
Bitcoin Cash is profoundly aligned with Satoshi's white paper. BTC is drifting further and further into ALTernative directions.
"I was also using Coinomi.. 

Maybe I move elsewhere for now. :/"
I hope you only fly on planes that follow the Wright Brothers' vision.
[Hard drives have hardly gone down in price over the last four years](https://pricespy.co.uk/product.php?pu=2167793)
"The Core implementation has added tons of IBD improvements through nearly every release...

https://bitcoincore.org/en/2017/03/08/release-0.14.0/#ibd

>tldr: these are not unsolvable problems. We just need developers who are more interested in tackling the scaling problem rather than maintaining their status-quo.  

You're just slinging shit and have no idea how IBD works.   

>
We just need developers who are more interested in tackling the scaling problem  

We have them, and they have made massive improvements to Bitcoin's efficiency, making the clients eons better since the days of Satoshi. "
Moore's Law has nothing to do with consumer Internet bandwidth. 
But if the rate of increase is faster than moore's law you are still going to have a problem. Also as the entry requirements to run a full node grows, normal people will stop running nodes resulting in increased centralization of nodes by corporates or businesses that can afford to run nodes. Make no mistake 1 August is progress on scaling using two vastly different approaches but we are not out the woods in any way.
"So, bullshit. ""related to Moore"".

No,  stuff just doesn't have to improve because ""Moore"". "
Excellent response. However, I do believe that today's planes follow the Wright brother's vision. To build on your analogy, I view Blockstream as more of a dirigible company. It's kind of like the vision of flight, but much more controlled in it's application.
What about the original BCC? https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitconnect/
It's bcash because BCC was taken.
It's called bcash, bitch
"Umm, no, modern aviation is vastly different than what the Wright Brothers foresaw. Jet engines amongst many other changes. Screaming ""Satoshi's vision!!!"" = ""don't innovate."" Bcash is dead on arrival, and the crashing price is proof of that."
"I respectfully disagree. Satoshi's vision (as I understand it) is a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, that is governed by a self-sustaining economic incentive system (game-theoretic), and fully consistent validated security architecture. I expect jet engines to be incorporated in the form of better POW (such as BFT or BLS), real privacy, 2nd order distributed blockchains (decentralized RAID arrays), etc.


I believe Bitcoin Cash can be the innovation proving ground that is not influenced by a corporation.  Don't get me wrong, as I am still hodling BTC (as well as Dash and Monero).


Regarding your comment about price crash, we in the Bitcoin community should know better than letting price behavior mean anything in the short term."
Calling bcash anything but bcash is a lame attempt to hijack the brand of a legitimate software project called Bitcoin Core.
"Well, there is a reason I said ""theoretically"".

>Haven't heard of anyone ""hacking"" LTC or BTC. 

It's not very common, and I wouldn't call it a hack but there are double-spends. 0 confs are probably okay most of the time even."
You're putting ideology over reality. Bitcoin Core is doing the best development work in the crypto space, bar none. The bcash developers, if there are any, don't stand a chance. 
"It's called **Bitcoin Cash** or **BCC**/**XBC** abbreviated. [Why is this important?](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6r4no6/its_called_bitcoin_cash_the_term_bcash_is_a/)
**BCC** and XBC are the recommended ticker symbols on the [official website](https://www.bitcoincash.org) and used by all 4 current client implementations.
"
meant bittrex (was looking at kraken and this thread)... 6/20 after about 5 hours which seems to be ~1confirm / hr ... geez 
bbcash
Soon.
Well, that and peer-to-peer electronic cash. This is different than what a settlement layer for banks offers (BCore coin).
What?
"> And how many people can do the same thing?

Not nearly enough to surpass VISA and other legacy payment systems.

You have your small x8 increase, while we at Bitcoin have SegWit and Lighting Network (first production ready, LN in alpha yet) - to have x1000 or how ever more increases you want.

All while being able to run own node easily."
"Every single legit bitcoin user in the world could transact and be included in the  next block with a very low fee as long as the spam stays stopped by the big miners manufacturing hardware.... mining their own spam fees to say WE NEED BIGGER BLOCKS.

Legit users will have years of low fee transactions with normal growth.  Sad part is the network allowed the spam so it was working as intended...?"
Why not pick a limited number of free transactions at random to pad the blocks? This way, if people don't care for guaranteed fast transactions they can still have a chance to get thru, without automatically allowing unlimited amounts of free transactions per block.
Strange.
Is that what Bitcoin is about?
It sure feels like /r/bitcoin in here
"I may be only presenting empirical evidence, but at around the same time I sent 2 transactions: a 258 byte blockstream transaction with a 0.0001548 fee, and a 257 byte Bitcoin Cash transaction with a 0.00013307 BCC/BCH fee.

75 minutes later, the Bitcoin Cash transaction has 4 confirmations and the Blockstream transaction doesn't have a confirmation yet.

Edit: 1st confirmation came in right after I sent this."
"yes ,you can send without a fee if you like ......for now 
Satoshi used to say we should allow some txs without a fee in every block 
Makes sense since most users end up shuffling their btc between wallets at some stage -"
Try to select another server
If no fee transactions are accepted then it opens the network up to being filled with spam. While it's technically possible I'd expect miners to reject a fee below a certain amount. 
Are we talking about the same thing? I sent myself on Bittrex some 3.2 BCH last night at around 19:00 with fees set to high in Ledger's wallet, and it's now 12 hours later and it's on 13/20 confirmations. This is definitely *not* how cryptocurrency should work or how it can defeat the traditional payment systems.
Was this post supposed to be /s?
3 hours no block?
What was the fee? Why did you leave that information out?
You just discovered litecoin
I have prefork bitcoins in my keepkey wallet. Can i send those to an exchange to trade them? Will the bitcoin cash be left behind for me to recover later?
[deleted]
">Not the artifically limited Bcore from blockstream & co.


Oh brother."
Did it take 5 hours for a single confirmation those days too ?
Becoming a bagholder does feel like old timey bitcoin.
the real bitcoin is back! i'm truly surprised there isn't as much of a market fluctuation as 75% of the industry claimed there would be. 
To be fair, I did few low fee (ca. 25 sat/byte) transactions on SegWitcoin yesterday and today, and they confirmed within few minutes too.
"What do you mean pad the block? 


Miners have an incentive to reject no fee transactions so as to make people pay fees therefore increasing their mining profits. 

Nodes have an incentive to reject no fee transactions because of spam that waist their resources. "
Any new miner can come along and enable RBF.
"Or use DASH - InstantSend (optional) is a safe version of 0-conf... literally guaranteed by the MasterNodes.... block rates are 2.5m - same as LTC.

Optional 'PrivateSend' too - coin tumbling with approx 50% of the total coin issuance currently being committed to tumbling (across 4622 nodes currently)"
You are correct. 
If anonymous miners would start to do full RBF then I'm sure that the other miners would find a way to identify and orphan such miners. Protecting the reliability of 0-conf is worth a lot of money and effort. We haven't been seeing full RBF attacks in the wild yet so we haven't seen any countermeasures either because they've simply not been needed. And even anonymous miners care a lot about the exchange rate of bitcoin.
Ethereum will struggle because it is a very expensive solution to a marginal problem, payments are much simpler and could service many more users at the same computational cost.
But that still encourages spam. With no fees there's nothing stopping me from sending me coins back and forth an unlimited amount of times repeatedly just to full up blocks and consume resources of nodes. 
They're not open source anymore?
I only have a 250GB  ssd ,but i use half of it to help the network because there are not many BitcoinCash nodes in my country yet ,you can always move the blockchain to a external drive after it syncs on the ssd That will save a lot of sync time for most people 
yes ,it does 
I've been hitting the same thing. There's a mention of increasing cache ram which I hadn't done, and I don't have ssd either.
"Did the same with Bitcoin Core. It took two days solid with midrange hardware and a good internet connection. The last day was spent just on the last year of transactions.
"
Now imagine this taking 8x as long and taking up 8x as much HD space. 
"Yes

With SegWit it doesn't fully do it any more, the chain becomes broken.
"Only non-free transactions are guaranteed to be added in the usual 10 min interval, free transactions would only have a probability of being accepted in that interval, but risk having to wait unpredictably longer; the incentive to pay a transaction fee continues to exist. By allowing but not prioritizing zero-fee transactions, it will help everyone by allowing people to move more coins around which would otherwise be locked away for not being worth spending, providing a chance for those small values to accumulate and reach someone that's willing to pay for priority."
Legit users, hmm, ok.
OS X version crashes, Android version fails to send anything. I still can't access my BCH.
For the time it takes to setup a full node, I might as well just sit in the mempool all day
Anon miners are best :) They can do non opt in rbf without sequence numbers as well, good luck orphaning that.
"Wish I wrote C++. But since I don't, I'll just ask why an Electron style system can't be built directly into the Node infrastructure, whereby light weight wallets could be fed directly from Full and Pruning nodes?

"I heard lightning was going to be ready last winter I guess not then.  

The Ethereum blockchain is already a lot bigger that the bitcoin blockchain and growing 6 times as fast.

http://bc.daniel.net.nz/

You can validate your transactions if you must with the UTXO set, which is a fraction of the blockchain.  Bitcoin implemented pruning well before Ethereum but no one uses it becasue there is no point.  Almost all Ether implementations have it and there are more than twice as many nodes.

https://www.ethernodes.org/network/1

https://bitnodes.21.co/

Don't confuse archiving as a function with validation. 

Blockchains by definition are computationally very expensive but that applies as much to networks and CPU as storage space.  Core have that balance badly wrong in my view and the market will adjust one way or another."
Psychotic break?
