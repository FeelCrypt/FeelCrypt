"I was a trader 5 years, I survived the crash, now I own bitcoin and I am Hodling for the long long term, I have been following this for some time and to be honest I am as lost as all of you, I am very confused about this whole thing, something is going on, I hope some of you can help me answer the following:

1) How can Bitfinex be insolvent if they are trading in volumes this high daily?

2) Bitfinex is issuing Tethers and sending them to other exchanges, I get that, but someone else has to buy them right? They can issue 10 billion Tethers but what is the use if no one is buying them?

3) Given the trading volume of Tethers, are you all aware of members of the community actively day trading Tethers? I follow a lot of people on Twitter and I rarely hear about people trading it so who is trading the almost one billion in tethers? this is very important folks, yes we know Tethers are generated but some poor sucker has to buy them right?

4) let's say Tethers are being issued and dumped onto poor souls on other exchanges, why buy other cryptos? why not just use that cash to stay solvent or increase profits?

from my experience as a trader I am highly  skeptical that this volume of fake Tethers can have an effect on the price on the bitcoin, 
 
6) So let's say Bitfinex is just dumping tethers and hoarding other cryptos, what is the purpose of this? What is the big plan here? Money Laundering? Fraud? or are they simply using the generated cash to day trade in Bitcoin and other cryptos? to me day trading in cryptos sounds like the most logical explanation to what Bitfinex might be doing here, 

7) If Bitfinex is actively day trading in other cryptos and not just acting as an exchange, this can have devastating consequences if we see a downturn in the market, ever heard of Nick Leeson anyone? 

a) best case is they are making insane profits day trading in Cryptos and everything is just fine for now, 

b) Worst case scenario is Bitfinex could have already lost millions of dollars day trading or from being hacked and is actively day trading to try to cover losses and stay afloat, if this is the scenario then Bitfinex is a ticking time bomb that will implode sooner or later, this could happen as early as next month or as late as 5 years, again do yourself a favor and google ""Nick Leeson"" better yet, go on youtube and watch the movie, Nick Leeson is also on twitter ;-)

8) Now the billion dollar question, the most important question of all everyone, under what Jurisdiction does Bitfinex fall? anyone here know? where are they registered? listed? where is there office? who are the owners? where are those people? 

which country or government or legal entity can actually interfere, step in, investigate and prosecute?

Coinbase for example is registered in the US, we all know that, they have to answer to the US government, who does Bitfinex answer to? If you are registered in Panama or the virgin islands are you out of reach of prosecutors? can you really do whatever you want and get away with it? Is is really that easy?    

Could regulators and government agencies already be aware something is going on but can't interfere simply because because Bitfinex is not registered in the US and is simply untouchable?

I guess we have to wait and see ;-)"
"Yes, because Coinbase is FDIC-insured (if you're an American customer):
https://support.coinbase.com/customer/portal/articles/1662379-how-is-coinbase-insured-"
"So what does this actually mean? That Bitfinex is creating ""USD"" out of thin air, and using them to buy BTC on their own exchange? 

I have some BTC at Bitfinex which I'm lending because interest rates are very good lately. "
"I apologize for dropping in on this topic 5 day too late, but if you have the info I'd really appreciate it. I wanna get this absolutely clear:

Can I, with reasonable certainty, state that Coinbase/GDAX is not in a risk similar to Bitfinex due to it being (to a degree plausible in the crypto world) a regulated exchange, therefore being backed by an actual bank and using actual fiat currency when entering or leaving the exchange? My question refers solely to the ""stability"" of the exchange, not the imminent effect this will have on crypto prices."

"To be fair, the could increase their blocksize, which they wont, but even if they did it make fix the problem for now, but it'd kill their argument, prove their liars, and ruined their sidechain patent. But as of right now, if probably say even if they did increase it, BCH won't fall. We have support and Core will just do it again later down the road. And I've had enough of inaction. I absolutely love to see that every day new people are accepting BCH and stuff is getting done.

Or watch addresses either. 
If your BCH are in an imported address they won't be recognized, you have to move them to the wallet address.
Yes, it's really happy news! :)
I have the same problem -- let me know if you find the solution! Hoping it's just a temporary bug.
It might take a while to fully grok this: Cryptocurrency is easy to buy, but old fashioned fiat money is difficult to sell. Does that make sense? No it doesn't, but let it sink in a little and it will. There's a few other exchanges where you can sell fiat, but the business of selling fiat is pretty controlled. You might have more success selling something, anything else. If you have any sort of business or craft you do, or a service you could provide, anything except fiat money would be a better product. There are lots of people selling fiat, it's a saturated market, even if you can get over the hurdles it's not the best thing to sell. Think what other value you can provide. Provide value up front and request donations, that works really well for something and it'd surely get you a few satoshi here and there! $0.10 /u/tippr
"Hi there! We have a websocket API for Bitcoin Cash. It supports the same operations as our Bitcoin websocket API, which is documented on [api.blockchain.info](https://api.blockchain.info).

"I had btc in the blockchain mobile app at the time of the bch fork.  Will that bch be in the mobile wallet when bch is supported?

edit:  just logged into the web app and saw that it's there.  "
[deleted]
I'm not very tech and I *just* did this. If you have any questions let me know.
So if you had bitcoin in a blockchain.info wallet on the date of the fork you now have the equal amount in a bitcoin cash wallet under your account there? 
"woohoo! update incoming ;) Thanks!!!"
Can you please make an exact copy of you blockchain.info block explorer but for Bitcoin Cash?
if you didn't touch your bch then its probably the same private key from your imported btc address.
I didn't event think about my BCH till Blockchain showed me it, I didn't note the address, and I don't have a private key.. Any route to getting it back?
"Cool cool!  We'll take it!

Looking forward to the day when it's everything. :)
"
What I did was sweep the private key into Coinomi on my phone then send a transaction from there to my BlockChain wallet.
Thanks a bunch for your help -- I was able to confirm the BCC balances using blocktrail, but they still don't show in BlockChain. That it ended up correcting itself for you is reassuring, I'll try to give it a couple days. There's no reason for the BCC to be missing, so fingers crossed!
It is just web API and wallet at this time!
Yep its there.  The exact amount i was expecting 
I only use Blockchain.info for smaller amounts. For the bigger amounts I use a hardware wallet. But because I don't want to carry my hardware wallet with me everyday, I store a little bit on blockchain so I can always use my Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash (from today) and Ether when I want to do small purchases. And yes, I am aware of the fact it's not the safest place, but that is the reason I don't store much there. Besides that I have my seed (that you control yourself at blockchain.info) locked and stored, and have double 2fa in place.
May the best Blockchain win
"Thanks, I mostly use http://blockdozer.com/insight/.

I just don't understand what people mean by ""fully support"" if there isn't even a block explorer, which I consider blockchain.info's main product. What then would be ""partial"" support?"
Ah, so how do I go about doing that? Only record I had of it was in the settings section.
"Mine either just reapeared,  or it appeared after I checked the balance in my old wallet, but putting the addresses into https://www.blocktrail.com/BCC 

After trying three, I found the wallet with funds in it. I then went into settings and it was there in my addresses for BCH. I've since transferred it into my new Blockchain BCH wallet, and it's showing just like my BTC and ETH."
yeah, waiting to see if they notice before I get in touch. 
Many thanks, I have that seed and the wallet is empty, so let's try this tonight.

"Change title of thread to ""blockchain.info now full supports bcash""

Follow [this guide](https://coinsutra.com/claim-bitcoin-gold-btg/). You'll not directly need your private key but the backup seed of your blockchain.info wallet. Make sure you don't have BTC/BCH on any addresses associated with this seed and create a new wallet afterwards (not necessary but recommended for security).
"hmmm... I had a volume of BTC that was in my Blockchain account, which I transferred into a new wallet. I'm guessing the BCH was in the older wallet. These were all wallets created by Blockchain.

love it :) blockchain.info is probably the best browser based wallet. I wonder if they will also add Bitcoin Gold? I predict it to keep going up as more people realize that bcore high fees and slow transactions actually means its a failure 
great great great!
Fully? Please tell me where to find their _Receive Payments API_ for Bitcoin Cash. <3 Thanks. https://blockchain.info/api/api_receive
Maybe not the right topic to ask, but does anyone know where you can find the private keys in the blockchain.info wallet for public addresses it used? Because the address where the Bitcoin gold snapshot was taken was used in my wallet, but I can't find the option where to retrieve that private key. (BTC/BCH is empty on that address)
hmm... I had BCH while it was in the settings (and didn't move it), but none in the main wallet now. 
@/u/memorydealers Sorry, removed Bitcoin.com wallet now, now that I can hold BTC, ETH and my BCH in my Blockchain wallet. :-) Don't need 2 apps anymore.
"Thanks blockchain.info!!

Its great!!

Recomend it for new users too

Have a block xplorer support?"
Sweet. I still havent' begun to use BCH but I think now's a good time as any. I was hoping teh price would have dropped from the 300s to 150 but that never happened. skeleton.jpg Demand for bch is a lot stronger than I thought.
Holy shit I was just about to post something on here about this. My question is: Can I see how much Bitcoin Cash I have on a wallet based on the wallet address? I have my Bitcoin wallets bookmarked so I can quickly check their value but I'd like to do the same with Bitcoin Cash.

Wow. This is huge. Blockchain's wallet is very widely used and an excellent place to store easy-to-reach volumes of bitcoins. This will make me much more willing to actually use my BCH. It is also very convenitent that I already have BCH on my Blockchain account since I had BTC there in august. 
Can you buy there as well now?

Concern trolling

"
"**Internet troll**

In Internet slang, a troll (, ) is a person who sows discord on the Internet by starting quarrels or upsetting people, by posting inflammatory, extraneous, or off-topic messages in an online community (such as a newsgroup, forum, chat room, or blog) with the intent of provoking readers into an emotional response or of otherwise disrupting normal, on-topic discussion, often for the troll's amusement.

This sense of both the noun and the verb ""troll"" is associated with Internet discourse, but also has been used more widely. Media attention in recent years has equated trolling with online harassment. For example, the mass media have used ""troll"" to mean ""a person who defaces Internet tribute sites with the aim of causing grief to families"".

That you would take my pointing the way to have a intellectually honest conversation as  ""condescension"" betrays an unnecessary need to defend your ego rather than seek clarity.

.
> I've asked the poster to produce the evidence from which they launch their whole tirade.

There's no point producing evidence for a claim that you don't understand. The first step is for you to demonstrate you understand their claim, and have this confirmed by the claimant. You've avoided that step.
"
Nope. The poster you're defending is a troll, as is made clear by their refusal to substantiate their claims. And you've defended the troll and mischaracterized the discussion. Obviously troll backup, whether intentional or not.
Shame?

They're not making complex claims that require clarification.

You imagine your failure to understand their claim counts as a failure on their part and a failure driven only by the desire to get a rise out of you.

Your condescension is also a form of trolling.

Trolling is not just about ""Getting a rise"" out of someone."
Yes, shame.  If you could choose to be rich you would.  Anyone would.  You can't get rich though.  And you can't even get middle class.  You can't even support yourself.  You are on the bottom rung of society, full blown welfare / poverty.  That is something to be ashamed of.  If you got off welfare that would be something to be proud of.

Yes, I am aware there are deadbeat losers all around the world.  I am also aware that you have buried you feelings of shame.

I'll not be surprisred if the Core team doesn't even hold any BTC any longer.
"I'm not saying anything is wrong with it. You're right, it deincentivises rabid consumerism. IE. Makes it less likely to be used for everyday consumables when there are other depreciating options available. More likely to be saved. 

I'm not sure what the disconnect is here? "
Because as long as there is a choice between spending a depreciating currency (dollars, chickens, milk, produce) or an appreciating currency (gold, diamonds, bitcoin) the depreciating currency  will always be spent first. The reason the capped supply of Bitcoin is flawed for daily spending is that as long as the tech doesn't fail catastrophically, it will always be an appreciating currency. 
Ok, but whats wrong with an appreciating currency? It de incentivizes rabid consumerism and heavily incentivizes careful consideration of spending habits, with a likely end result of reducing waste. Just like using precious metals as currency... Nothing wrong with that, is there?
Ok so what I'm hearing is that right now, due to volatility, it's risky to use BTC for purchases. I get that. But does that make being capped flawed in the absolute sense and for the long term post-fiat? If so, how? Just so you know, I get a sense of that as well, but I can't put my finger on why exactly.

"Using bitcoin is like reading the bible: hardcore ""believers"" never bother, and most people who do then start to question their faith."
"Not correct. Bitcoin is a name of the system. if you want to follow that system, you are effectively not using / running a Bitcoin system. This is why when someone uses the Bitcoin code and changes it, they create an altcoin.

Bitcoin Cash used the Bitcoin code, SegWit change it. Lighting network is nothing like a Bitcoin system... so if someone should have right to use the Bitcoin name, it should be Bitcoin Cash... but... as the Bitcoin system is defined to be the one that is the longest chain (most PoW) technically Bitcoin core still has this (the portion not using SegWit)... but this will change... I am sure of that, its just matter of time."

Stupid initiative, even looks stupid himself. 
Like all crypto subs, the quality takes a dive when price is volatile, but regarding the current thread topic, I don't even know who is around to take the other side of the argument on this one. It's hard to look at this as anything other than extreme delusion, the product of censorship-addled minds.

Sounds just like customer to customer transactions at my bank.
Don't forget that each block has to be forwarded to every single node. The Internet as a whole might not be able to sustain that much bandwidth yet. I don't know the numbers. My point is that it's not that simple.

I've got transactions with fees in the 100 - 200 range which remain unconfirmed...
That fee is nonsense, he's offering 2.23 
Don't worry. I'm working on a time machine. It will be ready in 18 months. 18 months ago, we were expecting it to be ready now but that's time travel for you.
Wow, that's a huge tip. People here are generous. I usually just do a tippr gild as a way of sticking it up to reddit
That would defeat the purpose of Bitcoin
I did a minimum fee on my core wallet back in i want to say july, it took 43 or 45 days to confirm.
You can buy the bitcoin, you can just never own the Bitcoin. Like those lovely pieces of paper that say you own so many ounces of gold in somebody's vault somewhere.

"Thinking for yourself is a very deep thing. It requires *fully* divorcing your social signaling and affiliations from your intellectual reasoning process, which requires seeing beyond the social pressure exerted by words and their socially mediated pre-delineation of conceptspace along lines determined by the utility function and presumptions of the society/subculture/tribe from which the terms arose. 

The tribal instinct is to ignore, downplay, and compartmentalize basic linguistic facts such as that words can have multiple definitions, that a word precisely enough defined in one context may need to be refined for use in another context or in deeper investigation, that indeed a word merely *refers* to a concept and isn't itself the concept referred to. The hallmark of tribalistic thinkers is therefore the tendency to systematically equivocate between distinct meanings of the same term, completely unconsciously, leading to a mess of [circularities and internal contradictions](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/60i3kq/lets_list_some_core_paradoxes/) that they maintain in their mind with no apparent difficulty, sliding around on the rails of words like they're kids playing Chutes and Ladders, believing they are reasoning rigorously with their impeccable logical rigor while they make a mockery of the equally crucial yet seldom discussed *semantic* rigor. 

For example, the Core tribe - including of course the rBitcoin mods - uses the terms ""altcoin"" and ""consensus"" in two distinct senses *each* (two definitions for each of the two terms) and implicitly equivocates between them in order to comfortably argue in a circle without noticing it. One sense of altcoin is: ""An altcoin is different ledger, like Litecoin, Ethereum, etc."" The other is: ""An altcoin is anything that breaks consensus,"" where consensus here means consensus with Core, but plays on the other meaning (Nakamoto consensus, which has nothing to do with consensus *before the fact*; as Satoshi explained, mining is a block-by-block vote) when they say or imply that ""Bitcoin cannot work without consensus."" They equivocate systematically this way in order to form an argument whose logic in terms of words-as-thing-described is perfect but whose answer is still obviously wrong because the words switch around what they are describing midway through the argument:

""BCH is an altcoin just like Litecoin and Ethereum because it didn't have consensus and Bitcoin is a consensus-based system.""

It passes over the reader like butter, carrying the sheen of eminent correctness, yet it is total nonsense word-salad. Two meanings of altcoin being used simultaneously, two meanings of consensus being implied simultaneously, switched between at the arguer's convenience to reach a completely false conclusion. This systematic equivocation on terms allows the tribal thinker to use a ""heads I win, tails you lose"" dynamic to answer all objections in a way that everyone whose mindset is colored by tribal emotions will be especially susceptible to. 

Going through the thread linked above you can see how almost every Core paradox arises from or is perpetuated by some semantic oddity that most Core supporters are unable to see past because their tribal emotions are especially strong (BCH has some tribal thinking, too, as humans will be humans, but being the rebel group rather than the joiner group those tendencies are naturally far weaker), and those emotions are partly tasked with keeping you on the rails of the words in order to ensure tribal unity (tribes in the ancestral environment changed situations slowly, didn't need to refine and re-examine words for use in novel situations constantly).

The antidote is a constant re-examination of the key terms (fork, Bitcoin, altcoin, consensus, fee market, scaling, decentralization, ledger, node, implementation, full blocks, and all the rest - there are fatal traps lurking in every single one of these words), a borderline sticklerish adherance to clear terms rather than immediately socially expedient ones, and ultimately to think beyond the words entirely. 

Thinking for yourself goes past merely reasoning for yourself under the constant guidance of the word-rails created for you by the tribe. Reason all you want about BCH and BTC, you'll never see the situation clearly if you narrate your thought process with ambiguous words that constantly pull you back onto the rails of Core's preconceptions that are baked into their habitual language. Thinking for yourself requires seeing that words are merely communication tools, a means of gesturing toward some concept or thing deemed to be a useful partition of the world or the subject under consideration. 

A word coined in haste or arising from the casual custom of everyday chatter will rarely be reliable when borrowed into different contexts where rigor matters, yet this borrowing is the standard practice even among otherwise smart people, with the loose borrowed term inured to a fixture over time unless challenged early on, its pernicious effect then leeching into the discourse and thought process of everyone who fails to perform a thorough vetting - and almost inevitably a thorough revamping - of the jargon themselves against overwhelming social resistance (to the effect that, in the height of irony, you are ""arguing semantics"" when it is in fact they whose arguments are built of semantic cotton candy you seek to unwind by introducing clarity).

The word ""fork"" itself was lazily borrowed in from software terminology, thereby erecting the rails of utility along the biases of the coders: that Bitcoin is primarily a software project rather than an economic one. Not content to stop at the seminal sin of Platonism by turning a verb into a noun, common parlance (sufficiently clear for a software project, but not sufficiently clear for Bitcoin) introduces further ambiguity by loosely referring to the results of said fork as themselves forks. ""The Bitcoin fork resulted in two forks."" [The terminology is FUBAR.](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6dcybs/unfubaring_cores_terminology_part_1_full/). One should say at least that Bitcoin forked into two branches or two chains, but there is much still left unclear there, and again there is social pressure against [laying it out as ""sticklerishly"" as it needs to be](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7fecjx/diagram_explaining_what_is_being_said_when_the/dqbi36j/) in order to simply avoid bumbling into a swamp of error by slipping along some faulty word rails. 

This is what we're up against, in every field. Words and our tribal instincts and social ties and desire for social status cloud and distort our judgment every step of the way, even to the point of convincing us 100% that we are reasoning impeccably even as we commit the most egregious fallacies of circularity and internal contradiction (that most insidious category of fallacies, those based in semantics) in almost every sentence, mostly only mitigated by our insistence on checking in with reality every once in a while (and the censorship, neh, outright debate manipulation, thwarts even that, oddly mimicking this internal mental doublethink situation in a walled garden where readers are convinced they're getting the full, undistorted story thanks to - wait for it, another equivocation - moderation)."

Yep I went through exactly the same. It takes a while to realize how much you are manipulated at r/bitcoin but when you actually take your time and look into the subject matter, you realize that this unusable segwit/lightning frankenstein monster, does not have much to do with Bitcoin. It is Bitcoin Cash that still follows what is outlined in the whitepaper from Satoshi Nakamoto. It is Bitcoin Cash that actually works as intended.
Sounds like complicated tabs.
"It's actually better than that.

You have your employer pay *in* to your lightning channel - apparently through Starbucks in this case. The plan is to *never* close it. It's like a bank account that can have a balance ranging from (i-owe-you-$X to you-owe-me-$X)."
"Oh that sounds so simple and uncomplicated. I can’t wait for my parents to open a lightning channel and manage their balances and decided when a good time to close the channels are. I can’t wait to explain all this to them. Gonna be great. Believe me. 

I’m sure your follow up will be, “but in time software will make this simple” 
Possible, but in what 2 years?
BTC will long have been replaced and cast aside for something less complicated. "
So it would be like buying a VISA gift card everytime I want to buy something? 
"Lay off on the poor dude.  Nobody understands how LN works.  Not the people here, including the computer scientists, not even the people designing and coding LN.  They don't know how it works, because it doesn't work.  It's somewhere between a breadboard and a prototype stage, not even alpha test.  And the people working on LN don't know what they don't know.

Try reading the LN white paper and convincing yourself that this design can be made to work safely and to scale at the present level of Bitcoin scaling.  I've been struggling to do this recently, and I have to tell you, it's pretty hard to imagine that the smartest people I know could make this work.  "
"The whole idea is insane.

I'm comfortable with managing counterparty risk. I have no problem whatsoever entrusting small amounts of my decentralized crypto to a centralized entity (aka ""bank"") so I can transact cheaply and easily with merchants and let the bank decide when it makes sense to actually move coins on-chain.

Banks and other centralized services that hold private keys on your behalf are 100% fine as long as they are optional and have to compete with each other to provide value to their customers in exchange for the fees they collect. In many jurisdictions they will be regulated which increases their degree of trustworthiness significantly.

Anyone who has kept coins in Coinbase or put them on an exchange or deposited them with a gaming service is already transacting this way.

The low, low bar LN has to clear to be worthwhile at all is to be superior to such centralized services. And so far it isn't. You have to pay fees every time you want to hop on or hop off, you have to monitor the network to make sure you're not being defrauded by a counterparty and there's no solution in sight for the routing problem.

It's a joke."

If we were to compare, many other coins have better long term sustainability than either bitcoin. BTC and BCH only have the 'first name's syndrome but both have their severe flaws. BCH is inherently centralised and if I want a centralised system I'll go with XRP for instance.
How do you feel about smaller nodes not being able to handle the increase in block size, bandwidth, memory and processing requirements?
LTC doesn't scale.
So you would prepay all your stuff. Not many people can do that.

Charlie seems to care more about BTC now than he does with LTC. Probably because their supporters pumped it. Even though Charlie publicly called out BTC on twitteR for their 1mb blocks before and core not listening to people being unacceptable before. 
The roadmap is clear in that Litecoin literally just cuts and pastes from the Bitcoin Core repo.

"Good that you are getting information from both sides.  Unfortunately many are not.

It's really about the coin anyway.  The personalities behind them may invoke emotions, but the coin goes on regardless."
Personally, I'm not. I own just over 1 BCH for speculation (and I bought a Steam key with it a few days ago). Short term (year or two), I expect BCH to gain support over BTC. Long term, neither will survive in their current form. There's competition from non-blockchain based cryptos with truly instant confirmation times and zero fees.
"You can do whatever you want and call it whatever you want.  Go ahead and give it a try.

I mean LTC copied BTC, made one change and started up their own crypto, so did dozens of others.  They do not claim to be Bitcoin, because they are not. Who else is claiming to be the real Bitcoin? I know of Cripple Coin and BCH.  Who else?

What is sad, is that you made a claim, I asked you to prove it and you made zero effort to do so. Sadder yet, you failed to read or comprehend, maybe both, what I wrote.  Go back, read what I wrote, come back and answer my question and then we will go from there.

"> but at what point can no one support a full node?

""Long before the network gets anywhere near as large as that, it would be safe 
for users to use Simplified Payment Verification (section 8) to check for 
double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or 
about 12KB per day.  **Only people trying to create new coins would need to run 
network nodes.  At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the 
network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to 
specialists with server farms of specialized hardware.  A server farm would 
only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with 
that one node.**

""The bandwidth might not be as prohibitive as you think.  A typical transaction 
would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact).  Each transaction has to be 
broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction.  Visa processed 37 billion 
transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day.  
That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or 
2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices.

"> I got into bitcoin in 2011 because I like being my own bank.

I would also like to be my own bank - but I've given it up, I can't afford it anymore, no I have all my BTCs on Localbitcoins - free instant internal transactions, and they do a much better job than what I can do when it comes to pushing bitcoin transactions out in a reliable manner.

> I don't want to trust someone running a $20k node, I want to verify transactions myself.

It's fully possible to verify transactions in a SPV-wallet, only miners really need to verify *all* transactions.

> I run several different full nodes for different blockchains. The fact that I can still run bitcoin core on a core2duo macbook pro from 2009 is really impressive!

I actually had to give up, one of the computers where I was running Core had too little memory the other too little disk.  Well, the remedy is simple: I should just buy a new server ... and the cost for a server powerful enough to handle full 8 MB blocks for several years to come is a fraction of what I've paid in bitcoin fees so far!"
Running a node actually slows down the system and is detrimental to network speed.
"> made conservatively

it would be conservative to keep the system functioning as it used to

it would be conservative to keep to the plan and not divert from it in radical ways


It would *not* be conservative to change fundamental aspects of the system (adding full blocks, RFB, segregated witness) without (and against) the consent of the users, miners, business, and ecosystem


bitcoin cash *is the conservative approach*"
"My fear is that lightning will work - not as anyone of us wants it to function, but function just the same. A small number of cashed-up nodes will set themselves up, share customer I.D.s with each other, and allow anyone with a payment channel open with any of them to transact.

In other words, lightning will be a system of banks we all have deposits with, just with different names."
"I do imagine that you will always be able to run Bitcoin on antique hardware.  The point is, if we want to take on most of the global commerce, today, right now, it will cost you $20,000 for that node. If you got in in 2011, that is not asking much of you.  If you run a business, transacting on the blockchain, I feel a node is necessary and it is a small cost of doing business.

The probability is close to a certainty, that by the time we get to that point, you will be running that node, dealing with massively huge blocks, in our minds today, on 8 year old hardware or hardware costing less than $200.  I mean maybe the techno-apocalypse will happen and hardware will not keep getting cheaper, but then I think scaling Bitcoin will be the least of our worries."
"as he wipes the coffee off the screen

"there is just *no reason* for all this when bitcoin works just fine.

Moreso, a functional LN (still though improbable to develop by many) would just be added to bticoin cash and legacy bitcoin would be no better off, worse actually due to the segregated witness code"
Can you provide a link to a demonstration where users only need to open their wallet and send to an address? Genuinely interested. It still doesn't change the fact that LN requires 133mb blocks or larger to scale globally. The LN paper goes through the math and explains this. Since Bitcoin Cash already has large blocks, implementing LN would be even more effective.
"1. Finding the route is not a simple problem for a large network.
Finding the shortest path is quadratic complexity. However, the assumption seems to be that the balances on the channels are static. Its insufficient to find just a route. It needs to find a route where there is enough liquidity (maxflow) and this needs to occur in a network where the balances change in real time! At 3tx/sec, your route is already obsolete by the time the routing information is gathered and a route is computed! What are you gonna do? Retry until it works? A million nodes running a million tx/day with balances changing every second. Are you going to tell the nodes to ""hold the balance"" while I send a LN tx? The whole LN idea seems not to be thought through completely.

2. Why would anyone want to open a channel to pay a person just once or when the flow is only one way? If the response is ""open a new channel"" then this statement is partially falsified:

> You seem to be misunderstanding what LN does. You won’t have to open and close channels for every transaction.

If people have to pay directly even 10% of the time, they wont see the point of opening even a single channel

\3. The update method results will always be obsolete, right? From the time a channel is opened or closed to the propagation, it will always have stale information.

If LN makes payments instant and cheap/free, crypto has won. Everyone in crypto wants this result. Im just saying that the authors and the LN backers havent seemed to have dedicated any depth from an engineering perspective and have only focused on it from an academic perspective. What we need is a new LN paper that addresses the formation, growth, operations and scaling of the network. Without this, I dont see a global payment network on the scale of bitcoin."

I feel like the BTC-BCH split is just the sort of story the mainstream media ought to enjoy to tell about Bitcoin. But they're not really very aware of shit so they don't know it's happening, and they're not very creative so they wouldn't be able to make a story out of it either. Someone could have any random idea about how to portray it and then the rest of the media would accept their framing instantly so as to not be left out. I guess we should really do some fucking PR and figure out for them what would be a frame that would make anyone understand this confusing-ass shit.
"
Holy fuck."
Try this with your English teacher. I did.
"No, that's not correct. They can use the $20 immediately literally after you sent it, no confirmation needed on chain. If you're a business you want to be able to use your funds immediately, and without fees ideally. There are no IOUs, lightning transactions are bitcoin transactions.

You only need to touch the main channels for these reasons:

1. You want to move some coins from your LN channels to a cold wallet, because you accumulated too much bitcoins on your channels that you don't need for daily use.
2. You want to extend your LN channels so you can swing higher with your spendings, and incomes. For example, at the beginning you may only want to use LN for small expenses and income, like pay per view, tips, etc. so you only keep one channel in your wallet with up to $100, but later you decide you want to be able to buy groceries and accept freelance payments, you may increase it to $1,000, at this point you have to do an on-chain transaction.
3. You do large transactions above $1,000, and you don't have a large enough channel for it, and you don't want to extend your channels. For example you sell your car, and you want the funds to go to your cold wallet immediately."
"That's not a fact. There is routing system in place already. It can handle up to a few million nodes, so on the short term there is no routing issue.

And routing can be improved without consensus rule change. Various wallets can compete implementing better and better more efficient algos.

There is no fundamental issue here. The internet itself works doesn't it? We routinely routes packets between two random points in the network of billions of nodes just fine!"
"You are right regarding the payment channels, and what LN added.

1. The whole network topology is now stored, so it's easy to calculate the route. As the network grows this will need to be improved, and it's not an insolvable problem. Wallets can compete to find the best algo to provide you with the lowest fees.

2. If there is no enough liquidity you can still send the funds the regular way, or open a channel directly. However this will only happen if the value is unusually big, and will happen less and less as the network and adoption grows.

3. The protocol includes a method to update.

4. I don't know, good question. Need to investigate.

5. They could indeed try that but they would take a huge risk, because they can't know how far you're willing to go to punish them. You may be willing to pay an on-chain fee to punish them that is more that you're set to lose, and they would lose all the funds including their own in result. Also, the network won't be clogged because the blocksize will be raised gradually to serve LN.

LN testnet does exists and you can open your own nodes and channels, you don't have to use hardcoded channels (not sure what you mean by that).

We will see if your prediction is right or wrong, but if it was indeed true that there is no analysis of any sort you can't be sure of you being right either, right? :)

I personally think that LN will be useful for certain special situations for the first phase. And once we have more experience and development, adoption, it could become mainstream and a true global scaling solution. Healthy scepticism is good to have no_face. Appreciated."
"Yes. Channels can open and close automatically, depending on the actions taken the by the user. For example on testnet now, if you want to send to an entity with the wallet that can't be routed to, it opens a new channel to them, but in the great majority of cases on main-net payments would route through existing channels because everything will be connected. The LN layer will be virtually transparent to the average user. All the users experience is that they can get bitcoin and and can spend bitcoin. All confirms instantly, faster than a credit card, the fees are very low, and the transactions are hidden from the public (no transaction explorer).

This is not over-engineered at all. It uses bitcoin's scripting language that was intended to be used for such smart contracts. All we're doing here is pre-confirming bitcoin transactions so at point of purchase you don't have to wait for confirmations, yet you get to transact in bitcoin instantly.

Also, remember that LN wallets also function as regular wallets, and since the transactions will be reduced on the main chain, it will be feasible to open/close and transact on-chain without huge fees."
Dude, your mom checks her email in a T.L.S.-encrypted session every day - you think she's doing the math by hand?  No - because developers figured out how to make it transparently occur in the background.  They'll figure out how to do it in the U.I. with Lightning.  It's a good solution, in my mind, and almost essential to any blockchain.  You can't keep growing the blockchain indefinitely, being more efficient with transaction storage is a super good thing.
"> Do you really believe a farmer in Africa is going to bother with any of this shit?

That's like asking if a farmer in Africa is going to bother with GSM cell tower overlap so they can make mobile payments. LN (and blockchains) is a technical detail. They'll see adoption if they A.) work and B.) there's a good UX for them."
"This comment just took mine to town haha, I'll be honest: I didn't know a single name on the list. 
Thanks for the great insight, cheers!"
"> Transaction capacity is only dependable on how many transactions one can send in internet, ultimately.

This is true in the case of IOTA. It's not true in the case of Bitcoin, because it depends on how many transactions you can pack into a single block. Bitcoin Cash makes the assumption that computation can scale sufficiently enough to handle computation, due to moore's law. I think that argument is much better than Bitcoin Core's model which incentivizes economic centralization.

> Increasing block size is a very easy way to pack those transactions, full nodes are not required everywhere, one can transmit only block headers, which is a small string of numbers. That's all that it is required.

Blocksize can increase to handle human transactions. It cannot increase to handle machine economy transactions. This should be obvious because machines grow at the rate of moore's law, so if Bitcoin Cash's scalability depends on moore's law to handle human transactions (which it does), then there's no way it could handle machines as well. Imagine all the microwaves, refrigerators, cars, airplanes, rockets, drones, vending machines, entire energy grid, all AI, and computers in general all able to trade with one another in a way much more rapid and continuous than people tend to trade. There's no hope Bitcoin Cash could scale to handle the quintillions of transactions we'll see."
"I'm in much the same position as you. I never really explored the different forks / altcoins much until recently. I never read /r/Bitcoin though so I didn't suffer from the brainwashing. Once I realized that BCH is the implementation that's closest to the original idea I grew to like it, but I am still skeptical to other coins.

With that said I'd just like to caution you that some people on this sub are very anti LTC. I think it stems from the almost ideological divide between onchain / offchain solutions. Anything that is offchain is generally considered bad here.

I haven't read enough to form my own opinion on LTC, but I just thought I'd share my thoughts and experience with you. If someone wants to share a deeper criticism of LTC than meme-worthy one-liners, please do. "

People buying BTC over 10k USD are fucking delusional 
You have this wrong. You would never EVER open a channel to make one payment and then close it, that's not the point. The point is if you open a channel with someone, we'll stick with Starbucks, you can put say $500 in that channel. With this you can buy your morning coffee then route through this channel to the deli down the street to buy lunch then maybe route through Starbucks and the deli to the grocery store to buy dinner. Then you could route through Starbucks to the deli to the grocery store to your neighbor or your electric company or what have you all while only opening the one channel. You could potentially keep this channel open for a long time if you put a lot of money on it so you don't have to pay to open and close channels. The gift card analogy is a poor one because a gift card only works at one place, when you open a channel you could potentially distribute those funds to a limitless amount of places

"Difficulty Adjustment has almost nothing to say anymore, market price rules the hash power - thanks to Bitcoin Cash.

Difficulty goes up in Bitcoin - hash rate deserts to BCH - difficulty increases at BCH, hash rate moves back to Bitcoin again.

Difficulty goes down in Bitcoin - hash rate deserts from BCH - the BCH-difficulty drops, and miners move back to BCH."
I was holding my breathe, hoping the-ones-we-call-Core wouldn't realize this, make a compromise and string the block size debate out for another couple of years.
And killed mycelium's localtrader!
Even more the fact it disabled Bitcoin's feature of one-way transactions.

"Initially bch seemed appealing because it is faster and cheaper to transact. This is only a superficially appealing because its an easy point of relation and understanding to most people that are just entering the crypto space.  

Every time I listen to someone that actually seems to be highly knowledgeable in the tech they comment how the quick fixes by bch, which yield those better transfers, come at costs that are at the foundation of BTC. So that's what I mean on the surface it seems good but the reality, as far as I can tell, is that it's a good marketing campaign. Just listen to someone like Roger Ver vs someone like Adreas. Roger seems to have two talking points that only relate to those immediately accessible, easy understand aspects. He never addresses how having larger blocks might affect centralization or security, which imo are much at the core of what btc than pumping out quick fixes. While Andreas always does an excellent job of conveying both sides

Gold Jerry!  Its gold!
Oh this guy thinks r/btc is spreading too much propaganda. So I guess r/bitcoin according to /u/unde__ is transparently managing public relations with no censorship?
How is it a theory if its live on testnet ?
"Not entirely true.

I don't like ver personally myself, and I've don't plenty of my own research - hence why I browse both subs."
Maybe you should look at the fact, so u look less like a roger ver sock puppet. How is BCH better that any other altcoin like feather coin that also focuses on onchain (block size increase) scaling? there is no innovation here it is just pure marketing stunt.
Of course market cap and adoption is important, but in the end we all want the best tech to win, so how can u advocate something that is not innovative at all.
"So if i decided to fork bitcoin with the exact mindset as in the whitepaper, would that be the real bitcoin. how do decide what is the real bitcoin if the only requirement is to have same mindset as in the whitepaper.

all u described was regarding development team. I do not see any mentions regarding requirements to a development team in the whitepaper, so u can not use that argument to call it real bitcoin.

so in the end your argument as why other forks are not the real bitcoin because of the development team. that is a sad argument

"I was a huge supporter of big blocks.

I just think it needs to be done slowly and carefully.

I got into bitcoin in 2011 because I like being my own bank.  I don't want to trust someone running a $20k node, I want to verify transactions myself.  I run several different full nodes for different blockchains.  The fact that I can still run bitcoin core on a core2duo macbook pro from 2009 is really impressive!

IMHO, bitcoin needs to stay as lightweight as possible, and changes should be made conservatively.  Once ETH and BCH pave the way with innovation, Bitcoin can learn from them and incorporate larger blocks eventually."

I think you are reading to much it this. If r/ bitcoin is censoring,which it seems they are, then it's not something good for the community. Just because I don't eat up everything about bch doesn't mean I blindly eat up everything on the other side 
Sure. Anything would be clogged if it had more transactions than its current cap. Uh, Litecoin would need four times more traffic than Bitcoin to clog, as it has faster blocks. But same difference, if there were that many transactions it would clog. If the cap wasn't raised for some fucking reason.

Its not my point, those are the words of the creator.
You say a site provided an invoice. What's required to create an invoice? I honestly don't believe that any blocksize increase will happen with core, they have a financial incentive, Blockstream wants to build software on top to relieve congestion. The leaked investor memo is proof. There's no reason it should not have been done already. Tech has improved in the last 9 years while the block size remains static. I don't understand how you think large blocks don't benefit transaction time and price. We already have instant transactions with BCH. LN doesn't give the confidentiality you think without having tor implementation.

Don’t you think that a 2mb increase for now would help resolve a lot of the issues were all having and give us time as a community to come together and try to find a better solution instead of this tribal hatred?

After I've spent all my money on the gift card, why am I incentivised to dispense with the gift card? I could just leave it indefinitely to avoid paying the on chain fee again.

I think VISA can close the channel in that case, to get access to their money.
You make a good point!
"Thanks for the link. I don't understand how that text supports the claim that Core will never raise the blocksize. And, btw, I do agree that blocksize should be increased as soon as possible gradually, maybe at 5% increments at every difficulty reset. Bottom line is Core did say they want to increase the blocksize, you can read it here: https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/capacity-increases (click through the first link). Do you believe this is a lie?

> at some point the capacity increases from the above may not
be enough.  Delivery on relay improvements, segwit fraud proofs, dynamic
block size controls, and other advances in technology will reduce the risk
and therefore controversy around moderate block size increase proposals
(such as 2/4/8 rescaled to respect segwit's increase). Bitcoin will
be able to move forward with these increases when improvements and
understanding render their risks widely acceptable relative to the
risks of not deploying them. In Bitcoin Core we should keep patches
ready to implement them as the need and the will arises, to keep the
basic software engineering from being the limiting factor.

In other words, it's going to happen. And if emergency requires it will be implemented as an emergency hard fork too."
Well Litecoin developers have the luxury of waiting to see whether it actually works before making that decision, since the blocks aren't full yet. I agree that they certainly have upcoming opportunities to fuck everything up.
The cake is a lie.

"In case you missed it; it was Core who stole the Bitcoin brand. They should have hardforked instead of transforming Bitcoin into a alt-coin (Bcore/SegWitCoin). They didn't, because they needed that brand name to sell to their Blockstream investors. "
You misunderstood. Take their side chain liquid for example. Off chain transactions collecting fees rather than miners, requiring a subscription fee. [Did you read the Blockstream memo?](https://www.google.ca/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7c29kk/blockstream_investor_emails_leaked_shows/) 
Correct. Either side can close the channel whenever they want. 
It has a low tps rate currently, it'd be clogged same as BTC if it had the same tps.
How naive. And what makes you so confident it will get done? Why should we rely on other chains? That's stupid. 
Charlie Lee said he won't raise the size, he'll only use the same LN BTC uses.

"They did follow from beginning u kid! Who do determine what is bitcoin and what is not? this is worse than religion. You are talking about the whitepaper like it was the bible.
"
Okay so it is okay to steal Bitcoin brand, but not bcash. what a logic
"You're saying blockstream has a financial incentive for LN to work, so they can make money, and you also claim that they won't raise the blocksize that would guarantee the operation of LN. How do you reconcile these two contradicting ideas?

Maybe, just maybe your conspiracy theory is wrong?"
"> I said unlimited block size.

No, what I'm explaining is just basic computer science. A computer can only process so much data, and only so fast. Computers aren't some magical boxes that can do unlimited calculations. You can remove the limit to block size but you will still ultimately bump up against the limits of computation. A computer somewhere still has to process a block regardless of its size. Moore's law suggests that the computation will continue to scale. That's great, but machines are computers - so if those continue to scale, then there's no way we can rely on moore's law for machine economy.

SPV clients help normal users but they won't solve this problem. A miner somewhere still has to process the entire block. Otherwise the SPV doesn't work.

IOTA solves this problem using a better data structure. There are no miners, and therefore no bottleneck. No one user ever has to be aware of all transactions."
Charlie Lee made it clear he won't increase the blocksize.
"Well yeah, they're ""useless"" as in they're minimum cost. They have shareholders. They don't go around spending money actually learning the news just for fun. Either they can get a meaningful scoop somehow or they give no shits and report what everyone else does.

They have fucking commercials for oil companies in the commercial breaks, lol, what are cable news viewers buying bulk oil shipments, they're so transparent about how they work it's just silly almost.

Such as.

How do you figure.

"Here's Satoshi Nakamoto's statement on users running full-nodes:

https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/565jy2/satoshi_nakamoto_discusses_spv_clients/

> 

> Simplified Payment Verification is for lightweight client-only users who only do transactions and don’t generate and don’t participate in the node network. They wouldn’t need to download blocks, just the hash chain, which is currently about 2MB and very quick to verify (less than a second to verify the whole chain). If the network becomes very large, like over 100,000 nodes, this is what we’ll use to allow common users to do transactions without being full blown nodes. At that stage, most users should start running client-only software and only the specialist server farms keep running full network nodes, kind of like how the usenet network has consolidated.

> SPV is not implemented yet, and won’t be implemented until far in the future, but all the current implementation is designed around supporting it.

As long as a mid-range computer can be a full-node I don't see any issue. Demanding that even a $5 computer be able to run a full node does not seem reasonable. Further decentralization is marginal after a certain point.
"
"Could be a problem in about 2050, when so many major retailers are running nodes in their data centers to process their own transactions that small, at home nodes won't be needed.

Decentralization will still be there, just in the form of a large number of powerful professional nodes instead of today's smaller number of hobbyist nodes."
why doesn't ltc scale? 
"> If it's a Wells Fargo Gift Card then it sounds like the system we have now with the USD. And it sounds overly complicated which is never good for anything in life. 

""Wells Fargo Gift Card"" is better than ""Visa Gift Card"". But it's not a huge step forward."
Doesn't scale to what. What does that mean. Litecoin has scaled OK so far. I've enjoyed using Litecoin for years, it sells me cheap transactions and nothing goes wrong. I'd enjoy if it didn't scale so well, tbh, so instead of it just sucking up all the oxygen by being a trustworthy premier coin there could be some churn and chaos. But nope it works splendidly, always has. I suppose they could refuse to adjust its block size or some bullshit and get it to break, eh.

[difficulty adjustment](https://diff.cryptothis.com/)
Hmm, I guess you're right, like BCH is bigger than the little alts that usually have to take a responsive position about hash power, it's also bouncing back onto BTC. BTC can't adjust because it's stuck in place, but BCH changed its algorithm to fit the conditions. If you're fighting tiny scrap alts then you can be oblivious and survive but BCH is giving it more of a real contest.
Still a nice disruption
Yes, first seen first accepted mempool tx's
Hey you might be on to something there...
"If it works that will end up being the only likely way, yeah.

But then they'll be hoisted on their own petard about centralization, and lots of people's eyes will be opened.

Meanwhile BCH will be changing the world by helping the 5 billion unbanked enter the global economy, something Lightning won't help them do. And the real kicker is that on-chain BCH transactions will STILL be cheaper than Lightning transactions, and when people realize that they will ask what was the point of the last 5 years of waiting for Lightning.

That is doable because BCH is about disintermediation, whereas Lightning is about intermediation. The only way Lightning can work is people getting paid to do Lightning transactions, that means intermediation, means that Lightning transactions may end up more expensive than BCH transactions.

At that point, all BCH needs to do is be able to scale on-chain.

It all comes down to that unknowable: if we can scale on-chain, then BCH wins. If we cannot, others win."
"I was asked yesterday to pay a $34 fee to move some BTC.

Yes, I immediately sought out other ways to move my money.  That just killed that BTC transaction.

People do care about using crypto.  A lot of people.

A lot of other people think it is a bank, a Ponzi bank.  Guess what?  Ponzi only works when more and more people pile in.  If there is no reason to pile in except that it is going up than the only thing holding it up is that it is going up.

And it goes up until it doesn't.  When people see that there is no reason for it to go up and that there are better alternatives, it will come down.  What holds it up now are hodlers and new money.

With hodlers only, price stays flat or drops.

If the new money goes elsewhere, price climbs slower or doesn't go up at all.

We have already seen this.  Take the market cap of LTC, ETH, Dash, et all and add them to the BTC market cap and divide by coins.  You can see that BTC should be at $50k by now.  It isn't because no one can use it and this has spawned competition."
"Ding ding ding, we have a winner. This is exactly how fiat works (how at least used to work with the gold standard).

You give your valuable to the bank (LN/blockstream). The bank will in exchange give you money that is actually usable.

If anything it's even worse than USD because at least gold could be exchanged at any time, here you'd have to pay BTC fees to get your BTC out of the LN (spoiler alert, you never will, whether you want it or not because it'll be too expensive and you wouldn't be able to actually use the damn coins). And you can use USD anywhere. LN? First you'll have to pay upfront to open a channel, go through with actually opening the channel... And do that for every business you want to shop at.

It is absolutely insane that this is seen as the future of bitcoin."

"you little deluded fuck. LTC did not claim to be the real bitcoin cause they HARDFORKED. At the start they did not have any intention to do offchain scaling, so at that time they had just as much right to call them ""the real bitcoin"" as BCASH has today, but they did not cause they wanna make their own brand instead of scamming."
[deleted]
No reason? There is a very good reason. To get instant transactions that are confidential and super cheap or free, and scale to serving billions of people and tens of billions of machines. On-chain we can't scale to serve one medium sized city in a truly decentralized manner, let alone the world.
[deleted]
"I just did such a transaction on a test site. Never opened a channel to them, yet the system was able to route my payment based on just the invoice (similar to a bitcoin address) the site provided. I don't have a recording, but the testnet is open for everyone to try.

Yes, eventually the blocksize needs to grow no matter what, and the Core team has that in their plans currently outlined as 2/4/8MB increase, but in my opinion we will end up with a dynamic blocksize that grows gradually and not in distinct steps.

Bitcoin Cash doesn't even need 1MB, it could survive with 100KB blocks, so it won't benefit from an even larger blocksize on-chain or with LN. It will be great if BCH joins the LN development even though it doesn't urgently requires it. LN provides more than just scaling, it provides instant transactions, and confidentiality too."
"Are you saying the classical traveling salesman problem is not solved? Well, it's true that mathematically you can't find the most optimal way beyond 80K nodes. But heuristic solutions provide a good enough solution if not the most optimal one.

This in practice means, you may not be able to find the best route to achieve the absolute best fees, but you will find a route that is satisfactory and completes the payment. You may be overpaying by 25% on LN compared to the mathematically optimal LN route, but you're still saving 99% of the fees compared to an on-chain transaction. Just like we are not sending internet packets in the absolute most optimal way every single time, but the internet still works well enough to serve our needs."
This is true but meaningless. 98% optimal is fine for routing.
"He probably doesn't want to answer that it'd either be the exchange or more likely the user who pays the $40 fee ($20 open, and $20 close given current mempool) fee one time. Which as people have stated, why would anyone pay $40 fee to cover 4 months of transactions when you can just spend $2 a month, for 4 months, to make 1 transaction a month for 4 months? Or further, one $2 fee to pay for 4 months in advanced?

It's snake oil. Ask yourself why no one understands LN, even while it's already on Testnet (suppposedly). It only may help huge (comapred to most users usage) micropayments that are made countless times a month. LN does nothing for me."
Probably a payment processor, an exchange, etc.
"> Take a look at the white paper, if I'm not mistaken satoshi talks about moore's law for storage capacity. As I'm trying to explain, you need only block headers, so ultimately one could have even unlimited block size and instant 0-conf transactions for micro payments, with enough hash power no one tries to double spend small transactions, and no one would accept mid/big transactions with 0-conf, it is as simple as this.

Someone still has to process all the transactions into blocks. Even if it's only a few huge miners, there's no way to process an unlimited number of transactions into a single block. It's basic computer science. It only really scales as fast as computation can scale (how fast a computer can process a block). That's probably enough for human transactions, but will never be enough for machine economy."
You're not considering the fees in your calculation
[deleted]
Yes my response would have essentially be that, but my response now is that even if you think LN is doomed to fail (I'm not too keen on it, but it certainly has potential) I don't think any crypto is going to have mass adoption with an easy UI for your parents to use in 2 years either...any technology that is attempting to essentially overthrow financial systems and be a worldwide financial network is going to be pretty damn complicated 
Tip 0.002 BCH /u/tippr
You got it a bit wrong. You won't open a LN channel with Starbucks but with the LN payment hub, with which Starbucks also has a channel. You're essentially buying a Wells Fargo gift card, with which you can pay at Starbucks etc. It's still a shitty centralised system which will not see any meaningful adoption because it's a huge PITA to use and has nothing to do with Bitcoin and provides a worse experience than nerly every other payment system.

0.00001234 BCH u/tippr  
Can anyone tell me what is going on with bitcoin unlimited, its all silent no ones covering it, their reddit empty, and they are 800% up today, seems like some one is exiting using it as a pod, same as they will create new forks as pods. But who? can anyone track and trace? someone is moving alot of money.
Regardless of the pros and cons of BTC vs BCH you can't call Bcash the real bitcoin. The market and hash rate decides not individuals. Maybe one day they will flip but not anytime soon. Until then Bcash is an altcoin.
"Most people forget that you can transact an unlimited amount of time between channels at no fees. Say you open a channel with yourself and steam...you can buy any amount of games at no fees at all. The only fees is open/close. How is that bad ?

You cant compare bitcoin cash to Bitcoin, Bitcoin is way way way bigger in terms of mining power, market, adoption, tx per day etc. Bitcoin was cheap and faster before too..."
">I don't understand why people are for it?

because majority of BTC owners don't support/like the people behind BCH - so they stick to what is currently popular and widely accepted. "
what is the different between bitcoin cash and other altcoins like feather coin that also focus only on block chain size increase. why not just use others? there is no innovation in bitcoin cash it will in the end become paypal 2.0 controlled by a few chinese miners.
ELI5 the difference between the two. 
There is room for both. Play all sides of this. Invest in Both. People selling their BCH are gonna be sorry 
i still believe bitcoin will be really high end of 2018, 2020 would be the year of alt coin
"So from my understanding the payment channel settles on the main block chain and woukd have to pay the fee. So if the main chain fee is $25 and you close the channel with 50 transactions you are to 'paying' 50 cents a transaction. Lightning would only be good if there was a large number of transactions.

 but then also the increase in bitcoin price would increase the fees, thus increasing the number of necessary transactions needed to make the fees low...

Is this correct?"
I sold half of mine but may but more after some of these forks are done. I still have much to learn but I do think BIG has potential if BTC only looks at Bitcoin as a  store of value.
Should be fun to watch 
"Bitcoin Cash is not the real bitcoin.

Lightning network is not a 'gift card network'.  you are exchanging actual bitcoin transactions that can be committed to the blockchain at any time.

Blocks can't scale large enough for everyone to use bitcoin on chain for every transaction.  We need layer 2 solutions to make it work."
You thought wrong. It's ok, you were most likely manipulated.
"It's not a fraud, it's just a quick fix solution that has nothing to offer in the long run.
For now it works great for transactions, but don't keep it as a long term storage of value. "
thing is even if its better, bitcoin is & always will be the biggest crypto & most popular. people barely have managed to understand bitcoin do you think they will understand bitcoin cash & why its better any time soon? i dont think so, bitcoin is going to the moon before cash. bitcoin has much much more bigger investors than cash. bitcoin is basically gold & bitcoin cash is like FIAT.
"Keep in mind the devs working on LN are employed by Blockstream, a company owned by whom? None other than AXA, the insurance giant whose shares are owned governments / banks / large investors. 

Pro-Tip: Google ""Bilderberg Group"" and see where they fit in the equation.

Edit: typo"

The deeper you go the more likely you will go back to the other side. I also jumped from BTC to BCH, but then went back to thinking BTC was better .  BCH has some very superficial appeal that is easy to understand but at the end of the day its just that: superficial 
Bch- under 50k tx a day btc- 400k
Bitcoin Cash to me is the most *Bitcoin* that Bitcoin has been since the earliest versions that pre-dated the 1mb limit. It was with RBF I knew Bitcoin was heading down a dark path away from the founding vision and blueprint of the white paper. I only wish the Cash fork had happened a lot sooner.

Exactly. LN has use cases, but marketing it as a system for customer/merchant payments is fucking retarded.
It's like presenting a Tesla car and claiming it's the perfect vehicle for going to Mars - when indeed it's not even going to the moon, probably not even home as the dealer forgot to include batteries.

"The more you think about the more you realize the Lighting Network doesn’t work and it will hurt businesses. Let me know if I have this wrong...

If I go to Starbucks and want to buy coffee, I open a channel or “gift card” of $20 so I can buy $10 worth of coffee. I want my $10 on my gift card I have not spent yet and Starbucks wants there $10 because they have a business to run. But we reach a stalemate because the fees to close the channel and go on Bitcoin blockchain is $15. So I paid $20 for $10 worth of coffee and Starbucks loses money til the fee’s go down. 

Why would anyone want this system? "
"I saw a post there yesterday where a new person was excited about buying his first $100 worth of bitcoin, but was confused about what he had Recieved, thinking he'd already made a profit, when in fact ATM and transaction fees had eaten it away to $75ish dollars.

Some comments saying, just wait for it to go up more, don't spend it now etc, and one saying next time buy more to cover the fees and dilute the loss. 

Short of the fees coming down, he's actually down to around $60 or less since he won't be able to spend it or move it anywhere again without getting hit with fees.

A 40% loss right off the bat if he does anything but hold. 

No mention of bitcoin cash in the thread at the time I was reading it. "

"> Yep I went through exactly the same. It takes a while to realize how much you are manipulated

I haven't been manipulated there, I gradually stopped reading and posting there, and I've always considered myself to be a ""moderate bigblocker"" - but still, I considered Bitcoin Cash as some ""dumb fork"" - but in November it became very clear that Bitcoin is Dead, Long Live Bitcoin!

My biggest concern about Bitcoin Cash is this: there are tons of altcoins out there, most of them have some selling points, they can do certain things a lot better than what Bitcoin can.  Rather than creating yet another altcoin (it does not have the network effect, it does not have the market cap, it does not have the most proof of work - hence it cannot be something better than an altcoin), why not promote one of the best altcoins as ""Bitcoin 2.0""?

I was fearing this moment already two years ago - sending money between friends, I usually say ""I use Ether and Bitcoin Cash"" and the other party responds with ""I only do Litecoin and Monero"" ..."

It didn't! 

What happened was that the vision of sidechains saving bitcoin was dying the death of the emperor's clothes. 

At some bitcoin scaling conference the Lightning micropayments network was presented and the Core devs pounced on it like it was a kilo of coke. 

There was no broad discussion about it in the cryptosphere, merely a mass of core devs jumping on to this new bandwagon in order to save their face."

"Lightning has no usecase except micropayments. And it is not secure when blocks are full. On BCH LN will be secure and useful. LN on BCH will enable never available before usecases. Like ""sharing incentivized"" torrent apps, Profitable dedicated BCH full nodes for SPV clients, Ad free websites."

LN is cool, for NEW use-cases through micro transactions. Not to alleviate congestion issues on the Bitcoin network. That it will NEVER do. 
"> The Lighting Network is a joke and not a solution at all. It's a gift card network! Plus, it overcomplicates things instead of making it better. I don't understand why people are for it?

You did say you were pro-Core too until you actually started reading into their proposed solution that you actually switched opinion. That's the reason for most people I think. They just cannot be bothered. They assume that they know the truth without bothering to understand the arguments for the other side. 

There's so many people people on Twitter or on news sites just typing ""BCash"", ""BTrash"", ""Roger Ver is ...."". I doubt if most of them have actually read anything about the issues apart from being spoon-fed information from one source (Core/Blockstream). 
"
">I don't understand why people are for it?

Because Blockstream keeps lying about what LN really does. They promise the heaven. But nobody who really know what the LN actually is supports it as a solution for everyday payments to merchants."
There’s just too much misinformation around. They just drown out the voices of sanity

R/bitcoin is staring to get loud and fed up with high fees. Lol 
Thank You!
"I'm starting to question the sanity as well. I understand that there are downsides to growing the blocksize infinitely, but it seems like bitcoin core is losing its way. Our original vision was to bank the unbanked! Seems like this vision is quickly being lost... 

Rather than a hard coded randomly assigned blockchain size number, would some sort of formula make more sense to limit blocksize? 

What are we sacrificing with growing this chain in the short term, surely we can't do VISA numbers, but we have to be able to alleviate 25$ transaction fees being the norm. Can't there be a compromise and future plans for scaling built into that?

There's obviously pros and cons to each side. Anyone recommend an as close to possible, impartial comparison between the two sides of the coin (sorry bad pun)? "
The realization period took me awhile. With Blockstream funds going into spreading their propaganda and censoring real information, the truth can be hard to find. Welcome aboard and enjoy the p2p electronic cash system.

"There are several kinds of incomes....

* work (miners)
* profit (traders)
* interest 
* rent

States have two more sources, which can at least partially be evaded, when using crypto currency.

* direct/indirect tax
* inflation

To conclude: Proponents of the Lightning Network are either banks interested in keeping their business models or early investors (making more money with less competition).

The community split is early investors believing in the power of free markets vs. early investors believing in the power of rulz.

* One uses ""decentralization"" as a means to gain/keep power.

* The other uses ""decentralization"" as a system description to spread/distribute power.

"If you combine a well designed lighting network with Ripple-style arbitrary length payment paths, then you could conceptually build a digital currency system with very low fees and instant transactions for people who were willing to leave more money than they'd ever use in one transaction floating in each of half a dozen payment channels.

I'm not sure it's more useful than Ripple. It's certainly not Bitcoin."
"You seem to be misunderstanding what LN does. You won’t have to open and close channels for every transaction.

You or the exchange you buy your bitcoin from opens a channel for you if you choose to the first time you buy bitcoin, then you can spend the bitcoins on channel instantly, confidentially and either free or for an extreme low fee. As you spend you channel opens up to receive on channel too. So if somebody wants to tip you then can fill your channel back up. Still no on-chain transaction.

You can spend and receive thousands of times without the need to settle.

The only time you need to touch the main chain (rebalance) when you have too much bitcoin in your channels and you want to put some of it in cold storage, or you want to increase the size of your channel so you can have larger swings between paying and being paid on channels.

Once the system is widely used people will only occasionally make on-chain transactions for initial channel openings, rebalancing and for making large value transactions like buying or selling a car, house or company. For everything else they will have the pre-confirmed channels to make micro-bitcoin transactions on. 

The next cool thing some people are working on are payment streams, this is another layer on top of LN and will create a new paradigm in monetary transactions for exchange of goods that are continuous like electricity or server time. You will be able to set a rate of payment like $1/min and you would be receiving money continuously in fractions of satoshi increments (yes, LN can do that) as long as your are providing a service. All these things are clearly where the future is and not possible on-chain. On-chain is so 2013. (Half joking)"
"The LN will not even scale as advertised because it requires solving one of the hardest problems in computer science: the shortest path problem. No one has refuted this for me yet, and I think it's because they can't. The best known algorithms for this problem are sub quadratic. So basically, it will be super fast at small scale, but once many people start using it, it'll become exponentially slower. Good scalability becomes exponentially faster. The only crypto currency that achieves good scalability is IOTA.

Having said that, Bitcoin Cash is a better alternative than Bitcoin Core because it at least scales linearly with the blocksize. Which means the exponential growth of computation could in theory allow it to scale for at least human transactions. It will fall short of scaling to machine transactions though, because that implies moore's law will have to outpace itself (omnipotent paradox in essence). IOTA can scale to handle machine and human transactions though."
Dude, exactly. FUDDERS just sold their Bitcoin Cash too early. If you spend 5 minutes researching and understand why things go up in value it soon becomes clear Bitcoin Cash is going to win. Bitcoin Core's fundamentals don't make sense anymore. It's massively overpriced because it's unusable as a currency. It's only a matter of time before the filppening.
On the plus side, now that you know what's up, you get to buy the real bitcoin on sale!
Unpopular opinion: when LN comes out, BCH should have it's own implementation of it. Maybe a different malleability fix or something.
Bitcoin Core as a store of value is like keeping ice dry with a towel, it will melt some chunks away.
welcome! BCH is the real deal, can't wait to see more adoption
"To be fair, most of us could be doing more.. even if banned we could be sending PMs and there should certainly be some kind of sticky to point to with a run down on everything.  I don't like the idea of a flippening though as I think it will hurt crypto in general but if there is one, it should definitely be to BCH.
"
Such is the power of propaganda.
Gift cards is what it reminds me of too. And I don't know anyone who has the money to lock up funds before they actually want to spend them. Everyone lives paycheque to paycheque, who is going to pre pay for groceries  months ahead of time?

The final goal of the corporation which owns Core is to turn BTC at the end of the road they're paving from a decentralized currency into a bank which they control by limiting the ability of people to actually control their coins so they'll be back to square one of having a money which isn't different at all than the central bank issued money."
"Agreed. I turned away from using this coin as there is no happy ending, when I back something, I need it to be real.

Market is a fugazi.

Transactions is a fugazi.

Development is a fugazi.

If people were real, it would be everywhere. When people are not real, people see through it.

"BCH and Dash are not ""sketchy"" they are just constantly attacked by people who support competing networks BTC and XMR respectively.  BCC is actually a scam, and that's not something I say about a coin just because I don't like it.

It is largely accepted that, being the creation of Dr. Frankenstein, the monster would share the last name.  So both are acceptable.  He was Frankenstein's Monster, but he was all the Frankenstein monster.
For BCH you should definitely read up. It has more long term sustainability than even BTC.

"Bitcoin cash is not an altcoin.  I first bought into it in 2011.  It is essentially the original Bitcoin, minus the negative changes that Blockstream and Core, especially RBF which made 0-conf transactions unprofitable for merchants and Segwit which was a kluge to solve ""problems"" of a non-existent network (LN) which can not scale in a decentralized fashion. "
"I recently found out that Bitcoin Core v0.3.0.0 is compatible with Bitcoin Cash but not the current ""Bitcoin.""


Very telling about which is actually Bitcoin."
RBF made physical Point of Sales impossible
Just the name, and shared blockchain history with BTC. Tech-wise BCH isn't all that interesting or innovative compared to other cryptos (but definitely superior usage wise over BTC). Adoption and market cap are important for success though. VHS won over Betamax after all.
If ever you wanted to know what a shill account looked like.
"How do you know that a few chinese miners will control it? How do they control it?

I would say that BCH has the original blockchain, complete with all of the historical transactions, and fulfills the goals of the whitepaper.

I do not think that BCH only focuses on a block size increase, but that was the best fix to the most urgent problem facing Bitcoin and what forced the fork.  It also removed the Segwit softfork malware and fixed the quadratic hashing issue.  Not only can it scale, it is creating innovative ways of improving scaling.  It has multiple development teams, creating multiple clients and is not centralized in one team or one approval structure.  Therefore, if one team tries to wrest control, we can all choose whether to use their software or not.

This is why I say BCH is the real Bitcoin.  BTC could have remained there, but for reasons we may never know, BTC decided to break our agreements and trash the scaling plan we had all agreed upon.  Now, they promise vaporware, after implementing a very questionable change that did nothing to solve the issues we had right now.

Now I do not know about Feathercoin and what it promises, it might well be better than BTC, but BCH is Bitcoin."

"LTC is nothing but BTC's beta little brother.

The powers that be won't let anything like XMR to take hold."
There will only be room for both if BTC finds a way for cheap transactions.  For store of value, BCH will beat it in time.

"I think we all went into this with a habit of only having and keeping track of a single currency, and that's determined a lot of the shape of all of the markets, the fact that there are star currencies that everything else revolves around. We try to make it all simpler than it really is, by just pretending simplicity onto it.

Like, Litecoin was a good launch, a solid coin, a network that's survived for a while, and it's under active development which is nice. None of that is why it's worth such an incredible amount, it's all because of its premier crypto status, its position in the middle of the market. Lots of places put LTC trading pairs, because it's premier and because it made the numbers look more comprehensible for small value coins. 

I don't think it had to be that way. If instead of these weird cobbled exchanges we were using, say, one open source exchange software that lots of people were running, and that software easily exchanged zillions of coins with arbitrarily precise prices, well you can imagine whole different shapes to the market. It is the way we expect it to be, the way we need it to be to comprehend it. 

But it also is always just a little bit beyond comprehension. There's newness to it. People don't know how the fuck it works. Nobody knows how it works because it's new. Should each person hold five currencies? Just bitcoin? Their preferred currency and have it all convert by robot magic? We don't fucking know. Nobody does what their grandparents did with their crypto. We get to make up what to do and find out if we were wrong."

Surprise, surprise. SegWit2x would literally take power out of the hands of the miners and gives it to central bankers and MasterCard. Interesting that after the decision to ""suspend"" (does not mean cancel) SegWit2x, Bitcoin gets held hostage by ridiculous transaction times.

"I consider your post misinformation.

We can do 32MB blocks now.  We know 1GB blocks work well.  We have tested 376GB blocks on hardware that cost only $20,000, today.

The other day a post estimated that for the transaction volume of an Amazon, we need 200MB blocks. Completely doable, all on chain.

VISA level is doable all on chain.

Now where the FUD of your comment comes in, is the insinuation that we cannot do this.  We can do this. Not today, but when we get there, the cost of running a node or mining the transactions will be the same as today and possibly cheaper.

That is not to say that there is not a place for layer 2 solutions, like subscription models, but LN is not a replacement for me sending you a one time payment or buying a one off thing from a retailer.

Bitcoin can and will scale. Anyone telling you that it cannot, that it needs a layer 2, has lied to you.

If BCH hits VISA levels next year, this might not hold up, but I will give you 2 BCH, which should set you up for life."
"> Blocks can't scale large enough for everyone to use bitcoin on chain for every transaction. We need layer 2 solutions to make it work.

When blocks were 5kb, BTC worked fast and cheap.
When blocks were 10kb, BTC worked fast and cheap.
When blocks were 25kb, BTC worked fast and cheap.
When blocks were 50kb, BTC worked fast and cheap.
When blocks were 100kb, BTC worked fast and cheap.

When blocks were 750kb, BTC worked fast and cheap.
When blocks were 900kb, BTC worked fast and cheap.
When blocks were 1.1mb, BTC worked slow and expensive.

Just follow the bouncing ball.  BTC has always (in its first 7 to 8 years) had UNLIMITED SIZE blocks because so long as the block was less than 1mb, it could have been a 1,000 terabyte block.

If it can scale from 5kb to 500kb, why can't it scale to 5mb?

"Every channel to another wallet, the wallet must contain the funds to hold those funds for the settlement. I will never want to own a business where someone makes a transaction which doesn't get put on the blockchain quickly or you start getting into the territories of IOUs because their funds are tied up.

If I sent $20 to a coffee shop, whoever's channel my payment takes needs to have $20 to cover my payment while the channels open. It sounds to me like that $20 will be used on said payment channels wallet and they won't be able to spend it until my payment channel is closed.

Tldr; sounds like a system of IOUs and money being held in transit and not being able to spend your own money because it's being used for someone else's coffee on their payment channel until it closes months down the road."

DCG is also an investor in BitGo (See ""How it works""). See also: Money map
BitGo aims to become a ""service"" which prevents double spending. I thought Bitcoin had that built in. Well this service is only useful if transactions aren't being confirmed in the blockchain (rather, confirmed in, say, a side-chain, like Lightning--Blockstream's developing technology). Surprise, surprise. SegWit2x would literally take power out of the hands of the miners and gives it to central bankers and MasterCard. Interesting that after the decision to ""suspend"" (does not mean cancel) SegWit2x, Bitcoin gets held hostage by ridiculous transaction times.
 
edit: also worth watching this video from MasterCard before they invested in DCG. Notice this guy is just reading a damn script, too. Smh. Probably doesn't even know what he's saying.

"On chain is now and for the next several decades.  No one needs second layer unless their blockchain has been artificially crippled.

LN makes no sense for one off or infrequent payments, the majority of transactions today.

I agree it might be good for paying for subscription things, but part of the promise of Bitcoin was preventing people from being able to take from you and canceling services.  

I agree with you, it will be centralized, ran by the exchanges.  Another loss.

"LN involves building a small world network, probably with explicit hubs.

Shortest path in general is hard. Shortest path in a small world network with hubs is pretty well understood - see Freenet. LN is even easier than that because direct communication is allowed."
Can you go more into what the superficial appeal is?
Roger Ver only gets hate because he is an asshole and flaunts how much money he made before Bitcoin. I see he has a solution to some of the scaling debate, but it's a very short term solution, without consensus, and isn't as fast as other currencies.. He might be right with Satoshis original vision. I'll give him that. But it's really important that the miners and the market decide the next move for BTC. It takes time and user activated forks can happen  
Also, go trip and face plant into fresh dog shit u/theymos!
"Most people forget that you can't transact a limited or unlimited amount of BTC on LN at all.  Most people forget that those who argue that you can do this or that aren't arguing about reality, they're arguing that their theory is going to do well in the future.  LN is a theory, an unproven idea.

"What you have described is a payment channel, which has existed at least 12 months before LN.

LN adds routing and some TOR style obfuscation. 

There are absolutely no details on how the network would work except in lab settings with predefined nodes. 

1. If I want to send x btc to a web developer in brazil, how will the system find the route?

2. The max amount transferable is determined by the smallest value along the chain of channel hops. What if there is no route that has enough liquidity? 

3. As new channels are opened, how is the graph of routes updated?

4. What happens if you want to close the channel but there is insufficient btc to pay the fee?

5. What happens if one of the many hops decides to steal the money and all the recovery tx are clogged on the network?

LN does not exist. The demos are using hardcoded channels and routes which is not representative of a real product. The most important parts mentioned above are not spec'd out. There is no economic risk analysis of any sort. 

LN is an interesting but sophomoric paper with large blind spots by folks with no experience in engineering or economics. It can never be engineered to global scale to solve the fee issue in its current form. "
Simple fact is that there is NO ROUTING TOPOLOGY that lets people avoid having to manually open channels. #TABS

"Interestingly, this paragraph that describes the problem Bitcoin aims to solve, accepts a very important postulate in its design:

> A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable.

Bitcoin has the ability to bring the potential for fraud on the network to within this acceptable ""*risk margin*"" by providing the non-reversible feature (confirmations) in a timely manner (difficulty target time). Time multiplied by work required to reverse a transaction equals security of the transaction.

Bitcoin does *not* have the ability to **eliminate** fraudulent digital payment. In fact, there's no such thing. Lightning declares to be able to do it, but that's a lie: it simply reduces the risk to a manageable margin (by way of a fraud-response failsafe). It's still possible to execute a fraudulent Bitcoin transaction by way of double spend. It's possible to execute a Bitcoin Cash double spend. It'll be possible to execute a fraudulent closure; *the difficulty of an attack is the measurement of fraud security.*"

"This is basically what I've been calling ""Fordian economics"". Now, this is a terrible misnomer because Ford was not an economist, but a businessman; but his philosophy was one that embraced economics.

Ford believed that if you pay workers a good wage and provide a pleasant work environment, they will be more productive and dedicated to your company, which results in more profitable goods and services being produced - as well as more workers-become-consumers flush with disposable income ready to buy those goods and services. He founded a car company on that philosophy, and proved its success.

It's the same philosophy behind investing (not to be confused with day trading, which is speculation). You front money to a company you believe will use the money to become successful and earn you a return on your investment. While you personally benefit, there is a societal benefit in that a new good, service, or competitor is able to enter the market - and if that societal benefit did not appear to have a profitable model, you would not invest in it, no matter what good it actually does. Accepting a loss to further a cause isn't investment, it's philanthropy."

Yup. [This](https://mobile.nytimes.com/aponline/2017/12/13/world/americas/ap-lt-venezuela-bitcoin-boom.html) is why I personally feel a moral duty to reduce transaction costs with bitcoin.
Hear, hear.
"People need to re-read the white paper. It's literally the first paragraph.

>Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for
most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model.
Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot
avoid mediating disputes. **The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the
minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions**,
and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for nonreversible
services. With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads. Merchants must
be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need.
A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable. These costs and payment uncertainties
can be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments
over a communications channel without a trusted party.

"> a ""store of value"" only has utility insofar as it can be readily exchanged

No that's a currency. A store of value has utility if its secure and doesn't lose value over time. That's why so many trillions are in gold, although it's been losing value lately.

imho one doesn't have to be anti-bitcoin to be pro-bitcoin cash. Bitcoin is unique because it was the first, is the biggest and is going mainstream. Maybe it won't work as a currency but I think it will take a lot of $$$ from gold and function as a ""safe"" store of value, protected from inflation, war, economic crashes, etc. That's a lot of utility. It will also give some credibility to the crypto space. 

Bitcoin cash may be the better currency. Time will tell. I think the alt coins will be battling it out for the king of the crypto currencies for a long time.

">> a ""store of value"" only has utility insofar as it can be readily exchanged
 
> No that's a currency.

Here, read this, and decide if it's worth continuing this debate.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Store_of_value

> A store of value is the function of an asset that can be saved, retrieved and exchanged at a later time, and be predictably useful when retrieved. More generally, a store of value is anything that retains purchasing power into the future.
>
>The most common store of value in modern times has been money, currency, or a commodity like a precious metal or financial capital. The point of any store of value is risk management due to a stable demand for the underlying asset. **Money is one of the best stores of value because of its liquidity, that is, it can easily be exchanged for other goods and services**

Any asset that can be bought or sold can ""store value"" . on that we obvious agree.  but the point of a store of value is to provide a liquid risk-management hedge.  a priceless piece of art may ""store value"" but if it's illiquid or can be ruined with a spilled Coke, then it's not a *good* store of value.  For this reasons, collectibles are not generally considered good ""stores of value"" relative to things like **cash.**"
No it isn't

"What is the best store of value is distinct from the issue of whether, if something can act as a store of value it can also have ""no underlying utility"".

Yes it is. A secure store of value that doesn't depreciate is utility
Also, you can't melt a bitcoin into a bar. Neither of which has anything to do with gold being a store of value, and not a currency.
You can make jewelry out of anything. People make it out of precious metals not because you need to make jewelry out of precious metals but because the metals are rare.
I've had this conversation about 5 times in the last two weeks.
"While I am generally a big blocker, it has to be acknowledged that this problem isn't solved by big blocks alone. We can't scale, AFAIK, to visa scale etc, with blocksize alone. (edit: to be clear, I'm all down with like 8MB, even 32MB, I'm really speaking theoretically here very long term).

So at some point the weird truth is that bitcoin's utility as store of value, and as means of exchange, do undermine each other. Which, in the context of Mises' regression theorem, is particularly fucking confusing. Or put better, it creates an unprecedented problem.

Now I'd love to be proven wrong, and wake up to a world where 1 terabyte blocks are no problem and a decentralized network can sustain that, but for now this conflict seems durable, and unfortunately BTC, as the most popular coin, has to deal with it first."
That's only because diamonds are established as valuable because people agree that they are, not because they have intrinsic value.
"I just realized the same thing recently. The bottom line is, both of these variables, the whole blocksize vs decentralization thing, it IS a real thing. At some point blocks could theoretically be too big and undermine the censorship of the network (and I say that as a big blocker). There is ***A POINT*** where the tradeoff occurs.

So this whole issue is about balancing two of the primary utilities of Bitcoin in the face of big growth -- censorship resistance, and affordability. Unfortunately, because this work is being done in the free market, it's a big old grey area. Nobody fucking knows. Nobody can agree.

But I do agree, the underlying issue is that the more Bitcoin gains value as a store of value, the more it's utility becomes undermined. So one would think that that will point to some equilibrium point, with lots of market booms and busts in the meantime."
They have a secondary use - people like to have them even while there value goes down
"Rather ""Will Bitcoin free me from being cyclically betrayed, lied to, stolen from, extorted from, taxed, monopolized, spied on, inspected, assessed, authorized, registered, deceived, reformed, economically disarmed, disabled, held hostage, impoverished, enervated, exhausted, and enslaved? And will the early adopters and fighters be awarded for taking a huge risk and going against the banksters? Then Yes.""

Being the main raw resource for one if the world's major and oldest industries, jewellery, is a lot of utility.
"In financial terms diamonds have one of the highest utility values possible. Utility in the financial context is the satisfaction a consumer of the resource has in comparison to other resources. Diamonds jewellery is considered far more valuable than cheap cut glass crap and so its utility is much higher than cut glass per weight.  

Bitcoin's utility is in its ability to be a medium of exchange. Yet currently it sucks at that and most of its value comes from speculation. Picture if someone thought bitcoin value was going to go down in the long term, they'd have next to no reason to buy one because it is purely a speculative instrument."

Store of value IS utility.
"It is a contradiction for something to have ""a store of value"" and have ""no underlying utility"".  For a store of value, by definition, has utility. And I don't think the adjective ""underlying"" clearly points in the semantic direction you are after.

I think what you are driving at is the distinction between something having utility as a store of value and something having utility as a medium of exchange (for everyday transactions).

With that distinction you could assert (if this was your view) that BTC, at the moment, has limited or no utility as a medium of exchange (for everyday transactions) and only has utility as a store of value.

And note that being a store of value is enough to make it ""a collectible"". But that doesn't exclude it from being a medium of exchange (for everyday transactions). That is, ""a collectible"" can also be a medium of exchange (for everyday transactions). 

So I don't think your suggested terminology is not going to do the semantic work you want it to. You could say, instead, ""a mere collectible""."

">It is a contradiction for something to have ""a store of value"" and have ""no underlying utility"".  For a store of value, by definition, has utility.

All assets that you can buy ""store value."" The question is, ""are they *good* value stores?""

The utility of storing value lies in your ability to extract the value one day. For that, transactability and wide acceptance as ""money"" are not required, but clearly make the value store better. The Mona Lisa is a store of value, but since it is entirely illiquid, it's a bad store of value. 

If you will Google ""store of value"" I believe you'll be presented with an array of suggested definitions all of which suggest that, for the reasons I'm giving you, **the best store of value is, generally, ""money.""**"
"> We can't scale, AFAIK, to visa scale etc, with blocksize alone

"> Isn't there onion routing on ln?

If the hub is forced to comply with KYC/AML (as it most certainly will, if there are only a few large hubs), it will have to know the real-world identity of the parties in any payment. It would have to refuse any payment requests that fail to disclose that information.

By the way, IIUC the ""onion routing"" in the LN ""implementations"" out there only would prevents the players from knowing the IPs of users, and (maybe) prevent the middlemen of a multi-hop payment from knowing the LN ids of the end nodes.  

However the path finding service must know the LN ids of all the users involved in the chosen path, and the LN ids of the two users who exchange a channel payment anywhere and must report it to the finder.

> Also, how could a hub censor transactions?

If the hub thinks that the user with a certain LN id is ""bad"", it can simply ignore requests to send LN payments to/from it.   A regulated hub will probably refuse to handle payments to/from dark markets, wikileaks, ISIS, North Koreans, etc.."
"Sorry, I skipped the words ""has a working solution"" in the first sentence; now fixed.

An intermediate topology could be a few dozen large hubs, well connected to each other; with each user connected usually to one hub, possibly to two or more hubs and/or other users; and each hub running its own path finder service.  

That topology has the problems of both the fully centralized and fully decentralized topologies. 

+ As you say, each hub would know about all significant payments to and from its own users.  

+ Paths would get longer and more expensive (two or more hub fees, instead of one).  

+ The hub funding problem would be worse: not only Walmart's hub X would have to put millions of funding in the outgoing channel, but any other hub Y that serves Walmart clients would have to put a lot of funding in the Y to X channel.  

+ Users with more than one channel may be unable to make a payment, because their total balance, even if sufficient, is badly split among the channels.  (Such a user could try to shift all her LN balance to one channel by making one or more closed-loop LN payments to herself.  However, the balance of each channel is restricted by its initial funding, so she may not be able to reach the needed balance in any single channel.)

More generally,  a large hub has many advantages -- for itself and for its users -- than two independent hubs half its size.  Therefore, just as mining got centralized in a few pools,  the LN would very probably evolve to an equally centralized topology, with only a few large hubs and everybody connected to just one hub.

"But does my point hold that it will be likely that, under a state of moderate use, each nodes understanding of the state of the network will not be the same? I assumed that each node will need to maintain some kind of table that it can use to pre-calculate the route.

From what I gleaned scanning through the protocol release, was that the anticipated network architecture would be a set of “local” networks. 

I could not figure out if a routing mechanism was proposed for a transaction to another local network. It seems like this would require some very fancy data exchange to plan a route."

It's not vaporware. There are executables you can run right now.. And if you don't 'trust' that the network isn't spooked or something, you can run two lightning nodes and transact between them individually.

"LN can be used for larger transactions, in fact the current rhetoric is to use it for all  “small” transactions (relative to BTC fees), eg the coffee in their mainnet test (hardly micro).

Here’s the thing I’m a bit mystified about - while I think there are unknowns about centralization, routing etc, even if you waved those away, LN depends on being able to execute timely transactions as the core part of its security/functional model (HTLCs) - how does it even get enforced when there are permanent 100K tx backlogs?

Also fundamentally, opening and closing a channel (loading your prepaid card so to speak) requires 2 txs. Current median BTC tx’s are about $15/tx - at $30 for opening/closing a channel, you would need to execute on the order of 1000 LN txs just to get to the 1-5c level that BCH, DASH etc provide natively. For micro-transactions it seems like LN would actually be more effective on BCH (or practically any other chain) than on BTC (per above, I don’t know how it can even work with full blocks). LN’s ability to do off-chain cross-chain atomic swaps also makes me ask, how does this benefit BTC except as a onetime off ramp to stop using BTC?

Worth noting that while I find LN problematic, make no mistake - it, or some other technologies (child chains, parachains, sharding) will be required for any transactional system scaling for global usage - naive on-chain scaling might give 10x or even 100x, but I don’t think is a reasonable solution for the 1000x or 10000x even 1Mx required for anyone shooting to handle any sort of society-altering transactional capacity. We’re still early in “land grab” mode, and without any single solution that will be a silver bullet, why so many from both the BTC and the BCH community both seem so intent on rejecting different parts of the solution is actually what worries me the most. The end result will be the same (being overtaken by newer, more utility-focused projects that will embrace the “all of the above” mentality; one only has to look at ETH to see what that might look like)."
"There's been some noise about a ""layer three"" solution, running on top of LN..."
It can't fail if it's never released.
I suspect their [Liquid](https://blockstream.com/liquid/) product is what they're really working towards here. Like LN it's a second layer solution, but it already exists (or so they claim) and it's designed so people would have to pay them fees to use Bitcoin.
"I don't know, but their followers have demonstrated extraordinary gullibility so far. It shouldn't be hard. A new unicorn tech will likely just be whipped up and paraded through the walled garden of rBitcoin as an amazing new solution coming ""very soon."""
for one thing, you showed the sidechains whitepaper was horse manure.
"With chip-hosting cards, a Visa payment at a cashier, hotel, restaurant etc. confirms ""Accepted"" in less than 10 seconds after entering the PIN.  No crypto gets anywhere close to that.  No one will use cryptos at those places if the payment may take a minute to confirm.  Not to mention one hour.   The merchants themselves will not put up with that."
"Ah sorry, i wasn't clear. I'm a 'trader', and part of a pool that provides liquidity on an exchange. The pool members always settle with each other off chain. 
Obviously, exchanges do settle off-chain, but probably not as co-ops!"
But how does the internet solve the routing problem in a way that Lightning won't be able to? If dynamism is the problem, can they not create a static topology?
">  information about any change of state of a channel needs to propagate across the network

Communications between users and services like the path finders would not go through the Lightning Network itself.  They would go through the internet, or some network implemented on top of the internet (like email, Tor, VPN, etc).  

The ""channels"" of the LN would be just special UTXOs in the blockchain.  They are not physical or virtual communication links, cannot really carry information or anything.  Likewise the ""nodes"" in the LN are not physical or virtual computers, but only bit strings that identify the LN users.

Those UTXOs are ""channels"" only  abstractly, in the sense that (for example) the general LN payment is a list of simple payments, each associated to one of those special UTXOs, with the constraint that the UTXOs of every two consecutive payments  have addresses associated to the same LN user ID.   Thus it helps to think of each UTXO as a link in a network, whose nodes are LN users."
"> makes people accept transactions that are unconfirmed as if they were confirmed. This is inherently insecure

Yes, doubly so.

As you note, there is no guarantee that the transactions exchanged through a payment channel will be accepted by the miners.  The receiver can demand that those transactions include significant fees, but there is no way to predict what fee will be necessary in the future.  Also, any soft fork could make those transactions invalid.

There is also another problem.   Whatever mechanism is used for channel payments, either party can cancel recent payments by sending to the miners a transaction that closes the channel according to an earlier state, when the balance was more favorable to her.  

The ""solution"" proposed for this problem is to put a temporary freeze on the funds freed by unilateral channel closure; to have each party monitor the blockchain, at least daily, watching for such fraudulent closures; and giving her the means to override the fraudulent closure and punish the other party -- if she can get that action confirmed while the funds are still frozen.

This idea can fail if the victim is forced to be offline long enough for the output of the fraudulent closure to be unfrozen, or if her punishment transaction gets delayed in a backlog.  

Thus, these punishment transactions are is a solution only in the sense that RBF is a solution to the BTC congestion problem: that is, not a real solution but only a ""hackers' solution""  -- a hack that *may* work some of the time.  "
As far as I can tell, it *is* in alpha. Unless it's feature complete, in which case it would be in beta.

"Some people here may be filled with anger and hatred, other people may be full of concerns that Lightning in reality will become a centralized payment solution (i.e. a handful of bigger exchanges running lightning nodes - we don't need any advanced routing protocols for that to work), and perhaps even some people here are *afraid* of the lightning network because if it really will fulfill its promises, there is no point of the BCH-coin anymore.  Miners may be worried that those big exchanges running the Lightning HUBs will take the lions share of the transaction fees in the future.

However, I think most people here share with me a strong belief that lightning *will not and cannot* fulfill its promise, because it's essentially a Mars Desert Research Station with a promise that we'll all be able to go to Mars - while in reality it won't even get us to the moon.

"Interesting article, hadn't seen that.  I just have 1 complaint:

>Imagine Alice wants to send 1 BTC to Carol through Bob like so: Alice->Bob->Carol

>Bob transfers his 1 BTC to Carol in the [Bob->Carol] channel, and Alice transfers 1 BTC to Bob in the [Alice->Bob] channel. That’s how it works — **Alice cannot “give” the 1 BTC to Bob to then pass along to Carol.**

I don't think that's correct.  It seems to assume that transactions can only be time-locked all to the same time, but they can be timelocked to different times.  So Alice could send 1BTC to bob with a 3 day timelock, and bob could send 1BTC to carol with a 2 day timelock.  That gives alice 1 day to reclaim her funds if bob renigs on his agreement to send 1BTC to carol.  Does that make sense?"

"For an asset o be a viable store of value over a certain time span X, there must be some confidence that the asset will have retained its exchange value at the end of that span. 

Even though they do not really have intrinsic value, dollars are a very good store of value for up to a few months, because it is extremely unlikely that they will lose a significant fraction of their purchasing power in that span.  Besides the inertia of the huge mass of people and businesses that use the dollar as currency, the Federal  Reserve has the mission and means to keep the dollar's purchasing power stable (apart from the small yearly inflation).  

For longer spans, like a few years, or for amounts so large that a 2% loss is worth worrying about, there are other assets with no intrinsic value that can be better stores of value than dollars: such as treasury bonds or bank debt notes, that promise by contract to pay back with inflation correction plus a small interest.  

In contrast, cryptos are assets with no intrinsic value that have no entity with obligation and means to preserve their value, even over a few hours.  Their market price is wholly based on hopes that the prices will rise in the future; and those hopes are based largely in misinformation spread by ""bitcoin peddlers"" like the Winkles, Draper, Casares, etc.  

AAPL shares are virtual tradable tokens that represent property of fractions of Apple -- all its factories, stores, stockpiles, patents, contracts, and all its future profits.  The market cap of AAPL of 172 billion USD is what the investors in the stock market think that those very real assets are worth.

Bitcoins are virtual tradable tokens that do not represent anything else.  The 277 billion USD market cap of BTC is not the estimate of value of anything.  That money does not exist anywhere, and there is no real stuff anywhere -- not even patent or copyright rights -- that is worth any penny of that money.   

That number is a deficit, a measure of the illusion of bitcoin holders:  it is how much money NEW investors would have to invest, in order for the current holders to receive the value that they THINK they have.  And, of course, if those new investors were to materialize and give all that money to current holders, the deficit would not be extinguished -- it would only pass on to those new investors.

Thus, bitcoin cannot be a store of value, because the money that is put into it does not get turned into something with the same value, that the bitcoin holder owns and may later exchange back for money.  Any investment into bitcoin just goes to the pockets of  current holders (or miners), and the investor gets nothing in return.  To get the money back, the bitcoin investor must find another sucket who is willing to give him that money, in exchange of ... the same nothing."

Bitcoin Cash is better, but only as good as Bitcoin was in 2014.  It is still much worse than PayPal, Visa, and bank wires in every aspect, except one: it is decentralized -- if one can call six pools ""decentralzied"".  

So, how many people out there will be willing to put up with all the disadvantages of bitcoin, because of that single advantage?

Satoshi never claimed or implied that bitcoin would replace those traditional payment methods.  His solution to the ""scaling problem"" was to deny that the problem existed: because he assumed that usage would grow way more slowly than Moore's Law rate (~50% per year).

As for bitcoin the currency versus fiat, there is no reason to expect its volatility to go away.  If investors and speculators notice that the price has stabilized, they will all sell , causing the price to crash. Whereas the national currencies of countries with heaçthy economies, like the dollar and the euro, have Central Banks with the mission and resources to keep  the purchasing power constant, minus a small predictable inflation rate."
"The miners process payments without knowing who the parties are.  If the governments decided that they should be subject to KYC/AML too, like other payment processors, they would either have to close, or would have to require registration of accounts (addresses).  

That is, there would be somewhere a roster, accessible to the government, saying that Joe Brown owns bitcoin addresses X, Y, and Z.  Then the miners would be forced to ignore any transaction that uses an input or output address not in that register."

Gotcha, so their analogy to treating money as info packets simply doesn't apply, there are significant additional constraints even if they want to sacrifice decentralism entirely.

"> For example, suppose that a channel still can send 0.123 BTCfrom X to Y. If finder A thinks that it can carry 0.10, and finder B thinks it can carry 0.07, they are both OK.
> 
> However, in order to maintain such consistency, a finder must be informed immediately of any payment that would change his view of the channel. In that example, if X sends 0.04 BTC to Y, finder A (at least) must be notified immediately that the channel can no longer send 0.010 but only 0.083 BTC.

But the scenario I'm discussing it that A and B both make their paths at close to the same time, and send a transaction along the path. Whichever ""gets there first"" would (could) put the funds on the channel below the amounts the other needs to complete the path. So A gets through, and B doesn't.

As I understand it, a transaction is an actual packet of data, that includes the route and instructions of the transaction in it. So if it is ""sniped"", it would just be marooned, unless X sends a message back to B, saying ""transaction failed due to insufficient funds.

Then B makes a new route, and tries again.

Maybe this is no big deal, I don't have an understanding of real world network propagation times, or how much bandwidth and CPU resources are required.

I'm pretty sure he's right. Soft forks add restrictions, hard forks remove restrictions. For example, making existing opcodes invalid would require a soft fork.

"> But the scenario I'm discussing it that A and B both make their paths at close to the same time, and send a transaction along the path.

Ah, yes, yes, that is another big rock on the road to a decentralized path finding mechanism.   

> a transaction is an actual packet of data, that includes the route and instructions of the transaction in it

Not quite.  The output of the path finding algorithm is just a list of payment channels that share the middleman nodes  (Alice->Bob, Bob->Claire, Claire->Dave, ..., Yves->Zoe), and hopefully all have enough funds remaining to send the desired amount.  

Once the path has been chosen, the nodes (users) in that path must negotiate among themselves a cryptographic ""contract"": a set of LN channel payments, one for each channel in the path.  The crypto magic is such that, at the end, either all those channel payments are valid and are exchanged by those users, or the negotiation fails an none of the payments happen. 

If two path finders found conflicting paths, that together exceed the capacity of some channel, at least one of the negotiations will fail.  

In fact, the negotiation may fail also if the path finder previously failed, for some reason, to receive the news of a payment through the Dave->Eric that reduced the capacity of that channel.  Or if  Claire dropped offline before the negotiation could succeed. Or if Mike decided to raise his middleman's fee, and Alice did not agree to that.  Or if Zoe got impatient and walked off.  Or whatever.

If the negotiation fails for one path, then Alice and/or Zoe must ask the path finder(s) for an alternative path that does not include any of the offending nodes and channels.  Those extra requirements may or may not make the path finder's job harder, depending on what algorithm it uses.  However, they may result in a ""no such path"" response.  In that case,  Alice and Zoe would have no easy alternatives."

"> Miners literally installing hardware in some cave in the Arctic complete with their own generators and all mining happening on an anonymous network like Tor. 

Tor is secure only against private parties or weak governments.  If the bitcoin users can find out how to send transactions to the miners, a powerful government can find that out too, and block it -- if necessary, by blocking Tor entirely, or quietly taking control of key Tor nodes.  

China has already banned VPN access out of the country.  I don't know about Tor, but they could easily ban it too.  

I find it bizarre that cypherpunks think of the internet as an ubiquitous natural resource like air or sunlight, that is outside control of government.  In fact the internet in each country is operated by a few large telecomm companies and managed by a national Network Information Center.  Those entities will not go to war against the government for the sake of user's imagined ""rights"".  Through them, a country's government can block internet access to anyone in the country, or block transit within the country for any packets to/from specified IP addresses."
"> is a hard fork. The exact opposite of a soft fork

You got it exactly reversed.  

Soft forks are claimed (incorrectly) to be ""backwards compatible"" because old client apps can continue to **receive** transactions that are sent after the fork.  However, those clients may have to upgrade anyway, if the old app might generate the sort of transaction that the soft fork has invalidated.  

That was the case with the BIP66 fork, that outlawed certain alternatives in signatures that previously were allowed.  It was (mostly) not the case with SegWit, because it only banned certain uses of a certain script opcode that no one had reason to use anyway.

It was blockstream and the ""New Core"" devs who created the misleading mystique that ""soft forks are good, hard forks are bad"".  

One reason was that a soft fork can be imposed on everyone, once a majority of the miners start applying it.  Thus, if a change can be implemented as a soft fork (which was the whole point of SegWit), the devs don't have to explain the change to the users and convince most them that it is a good change and they must all upgrade.  Like the Bitcoin Cash devs had to do when they had to change the DAA (a hard fork).  

Another reason was that raising the block size limit would require a hard fork, and Blockstream's roadmap absolutely required the bitcoin network to become congested.  Claiming that hard forks were radioactive ebola helped them a lot in that regard."

"Right and the weakness a miner has really is that they require a large physical installation of hardware.  They aren't like The Silk Road --
 run by a few guys with laptops from a public library.  You can arrest and shut down a large miner easily if you're a government.  So miners have to comply with their local laws or be forced underground.

It would be an interesting experiment to see this play out.  Of course you can't get uniform regulations globally and some countries may not even sign up for such a multi-national treaty.  Incentives get created for some countries to hold out and grab all the crypto business.

And of course some miners could end up underground.  It would be strange times if this happened.  Something out of a cyberpunk novel like Neuromancer.  Miners literally installing hardware in some cave in the Arctic complete with their own generators and all mining happening on an anonymous network like Tor.  Crazy.   (This assumes that there is continued demand for cryptos).  Or ""rogue"" states like ISIS also running bitcoin mining to fund their operations.  They have guns and some territory so they can say ""fuck you"" to US and EU regulators.  Crazy.

Or it could go the other route -- we all end up using something like scrypt or Cryptonight based cryptos and all mine on our personal computers -- hundreds of thousands of little miners securing a crypto.  fuck you government. Police this!

Essentially it boils down to the age-old risk of governments outlawing or otherwise restricting cryptos, to which the counter-argument is you can't really completely kill cryptos because the world is a big place and uniform regulations or control are unlikely to happen because it's so hard to police.

"> the current implementations just use a fucking gossip protocol.

Yes, every channel update is broadcast to every peer (at least this is what was available just a few weeks ago) which means it scales like onchain Bitcoin but without SPV because every channel endpoint is a peer; whereas with Bitcoin only miners and fullnodes are peers that receive gossip.

They claim that even though every client knows the topology of the whole network and even though the values of a channel can be determined through probing, that this is still ""private.""  I remain extremely skeptical of that claim."
"I'm all about thinking exponentially, but doing some math is probably worthwhile as well.

180KB/600s = 300B/s = 2400bps - that puts us at say, 1992? Netflix's 4K streaming bitrate is 15.6Mbps (average US Internet connection speed is 18.7Mbps according to Akamai) - that's 8000X over the course of 25 years, not bad! (comes out to about a 36% annual growth rate).

Currently global avg internet speed and IP traffic has been clocked at growing at about 20-25% per year (Cisco et al), which comes out to about 2X every 3 years.

BCH has 8MB blocks currently (and only a 4X increase to 32MB - math, remember?), that might get you to about 100tps, but how realistic is the rest? A jump to 1GB blocks mind you only get you to 3Ktps, but requires a 30X of transmission and storage (this would require 15 years, not two years of growth rates depending on how safe you think the current upper limit is). While I don't have M0 or M1 transaction rates handy, Alipay alone clocks in at peaks of over 250Ktps today. To handle that on-chain would require 80GB blocks.

Suffice to say, I *don't* think I agree that any amount of on-chain capacity expansion can fulfill even a fraction of the transactional demands of existing payment services, much less any of the other purpose a decentralized ledger can serve (honestly, other technologies may have eaten Bitcoin's lunch there already, but that's besides the point unless you're some sort of maximalist)."
Pssst bitcoin cash is mooning
">  I don’t think is a reasonable solution for the 1000x or 10000x even 1Mx required for anyone shooting to handle any sort of society-altering transactional capacity.

Old dude here.

I remember when downloading a 180K GIF took ten minutes and usually failed.

When you're sitting there, and the state of the art is ""one lo-res frame per ten minutes"" then the idea that this thing could scale up to support 240 megapixels *per second* of 4K video sounds pretty much like impossible bullshit.  And yet, here we are, 30 years later, and people are streaming 4K video *practically for free* to their homes.

BCH is already prepared for 32X blocks.  32X is a **fuckton** of extra scaling.  in 2018 BCH will lift the 32MB protocol limit and then will be on track for another step-function increase in capacity.

Gigabyte blocks *are not sci-fi* but will be production ready within two years, easy.  We already know how to solve parallel validation, there are no unsolved problems here: all that is required is to optimize the code and specify a caliber of machine capable of handling the throughput.  These machines exist today and in 18-36 months will be extremely affordable.

I've worked my entire adult life in infotech.  The budgets required to host gigabyte blocks *even today* are well within the reach of millions of companies.  And we're years away from needing blocks this big.

So no, I don't subscribe to the theory that ""bigger blocks won't scale.""   They will scale until they don't, which is to say, for now, and for the foreseeable future, we have abundant onchain capacity.

While I will **absolutely welcome** any sort of orthogonal scaling proposals, I think we need to start by agreeing that there is so much potential for onchain capacity already, that it's unclear what purpose these offchain solutions really serve at least for many more years."

"When the SEC asked for public comments about the Winkle's bitcoin ETF, I sent them a letter with my contrary opinion.  Basically, investing in bitcoin (directly or through an ETF wrapper) is a negative-sum game, from which investors as a whole always get out less than what they put in.  Investing in bitcoin is as wise as investing in lottery tickets, a roulette at Las Vegas, a pyramid  scheme, a ponzi scheme, or a pumped-up penny stock.  If the SEC does not allow *Wolf of Wall Street* type operations, why should it allow a bitcoin ETF?

Other than that, I have not ""actively worked for onerous regulation"".  Whereas many bitcoin ""heroes"", in fact, have been asking for that.  

However, I do think that governments will eventually ban cryptocurrencies (as some have done already), once they realize that they are good for nothing else but illegal payments -- not because they are ""decentralized"", but because the miners are (still) ignoring KYC/AML laws. "

"That applies to any  asset that is not productive and has no intrinsic value, but is traded as a speculative investment.  Thus any crypto (if viewed as investment), but also penny stocks, ICO tokens, cryptokitties, Rare Pepes, etc.  

Sometimes an asset is a thing with nonzero intrinsic value, whose market price is over-inflated by speculative trading.  That is the case of gold (in my estimate, at least 75% speculative now); and was at certain times the case of beanie babies, tulip bulbs, pigeons, alpacas, ostriches, baseball cards, ...  

In those cases, my comments apply to the part of the market price that is above the intrinsic value.  Thus the price of gold is likely to crash to $300/oz or less; but that crash will happen when most investors don't expect, and before they can react.

Because the channel's balances changes, so routes necessarily change as the amount of available money in a channel changes.
"Internet routing is logically centralized.  The ICANN distributes IP ranges to countries, and the NIC in each country assigns individual IPs to users or internet service providers.  The telecom companies that implement the backbone in each country know the IPs of their subscribers and how to route packets to them.  The DNS and routing tables in the various gateways are built with information obtained from those sources.

Thus, unless your partner is in the same ISP or other local network, your packets almost certainly will go through cables and routers owned by one or a few big Telecom companies.

Apart from being centralzied, packet routing through the internet also differs from path finding in the LN in several aspects.  For one thing, in the internet there is no concept of ""current channel balance"" that changes dynamically and limits which packets can go through a given data link.  

Also there is no need to ""freeze"" all links in the path of of an internet packet, while the packet is in transit.  In this regard, the LN is more like the old telephone network (as of 1980, say), in which each call required setting up a dedicated circuit through switchboards and trunk cables, which were locked up for the duration of the call."
"> each nodes understanding of the state of the network will not be the same

If there are two or more path-finders (for instance, if every node runs a path finding algorithm on it own), they do not have to agree on their knowledge of channel states, as long as they are both consistent with the truth.  

For example, suppose that a channel still can send 0.123 BTCfrom X to Y.  If finder A thinks that it can carry 0.10, and finder B thinks it can carry 0.07, they are both OK.  

However, in order to maintain such consistency, a finder must be informed immediately of any payment that would change his view of the channel. In that example, if X sends 0.04 BTC to Y, finder A (at least) must be notified immediately that the channel can no longer send 0.010 but only 0.083 BTC. 

> each node will need to maintain some kind of table that it can use to pre-calculate the route.

Each finder must maintain a picture of the network and the remaining capacity of each channel.  It can obtain the network by scanning the blockchain and collecting all UTXOs that look like payment channels.  However the remaining capacity is not in the blockhain; every user must tell every finder, at least about significant payments.

> the anticipated network architecture would be a set of “local” networks.

There is such a proposal, called the FLARE algorithm.  In a network of a million users, it could have a few thousand partially overlapping local networks, each with a few thousand users and a ""beacon"" (path finding) node.  If  Alice wants to send a payment to Zoe, each would send a request to her respective beacon, A0 or Z0.  The beacons would somehow find a user Mike that lies on both local networks.  Then A0 finds a path from Alice to Mike, Z0  finds one from Mike to Zoe, and the two paths together would be the desired payment path.

This schema is more efficient than every node running its own path finder.  Still, the local networks must be large enough and numerous enough to ensure that any two of them have at least one node in common, that is willing to serve as a middleman.  I don't know how one could ensure this condition.  Anyway every user would still have to report every payment he makes to the beacons of all the local networks that contain it."
"A soft fork is a change in the block and tx validity criteria that makes them more restrictive.  That is, that invalidates some transactions or blocks that previously were valid.  

For example, suppose that a majority of the miners agrees to impose a minimum value of 1000 satoshis for any output of any transaction.  That would be a soft fork.  

Thus any soft fork can potentially invalidate any transaction that was valid when created but was only sent to miners after the fork.  Such as the transactions that are exchanged through a payment channel.

Typically soft forks are announced months before they are implemented, so they are not a problem for ordinary payments. But it is expected that some LN payments will be sent to miners many months after they are signed.  "

kaching!  nice tip!
"LN has already been released many decades ago, it is called prepaid card, and that model does not provide large scaling gain for private users

The only use case I can see a large benefit of LN is major exchanges and wallets doing their settlements using a LN channel, thus move all the user transactions between exchange A and wallet B off-chain. But that is under an assumption that those hubs will grow bigger and bigger and become monopol. But in reality even coinbase and localbitcoins are already showing signs of out of capacity thus more exchanges and wallets will be required to serve exponentially increasing user count"
">  It's completely dysfunctional and it's embarrassing to have bitcoin core representing crypto.

Yup. When newcomers see the fees they have to pay for a transaction they may think it is just a racket."
"However, what has been released is not going to provide any relief.  

One of the unsolved economic problems is that the LN cannot start small and grow by attracting users.  It cannot work if only (say) half of the bitcoin users choose to use it.  It needs to be a closed economy, with little flow of bitcoins into or out of the system.  And in fact it needs to be locally balanced, in the sense that each user must eventually spend everything that he earns, before saturating his channels --- that is, no LN user may keep getting richer with time.  

And that is only one of the problems..."
"I agree that it's embarrassing and I would like them to release LN so that it can fail spectacularly too...

I don't think it will fix anything based on what I've read, so.. I just want to see core proven so wrong that they are forced to scale on-chain.
"
Why do you care? BCH has 8MB blocks, almost VISA level.
They made it to *MVP* - Minimal Viable Product. And I’m still debating on viable.
"> We're still waiting for the proof of concept decentralized scalable private routing system.

It will be hub and spoke. To be less centralized the newtork would need much bigger blocks, but I don't see Core devs wanting to increase it soon.

And large hubs may offer people BTC-IOU@LN and manage the account balances and the private key themselves. We may see mainstream adoption of people who don't even know what a private key is. Using a BTC IOU over LN is way easier to the average joe than using real BTC onchain. Those hubs may offer credit and investment. It is banking 2.0. At least banking with BTC IOUs is better than banking with fiat. But worst than ""being your own bank""."
"As someone who has studied software development, as well as design methodologies, I'm sorry but your classification system and definitions are really bad. Please understand that you're being upvoted not for the quality of your software analysis, but because people here already agree with you.

>A proof of concept is an experimental version that provides only the key innovative functionality of the product

A proof of concept proves a concept that needs to be proven. It's easy to imagine some innovative functionality that does not need a proof of concept. Imagine a button on an app called ""beer me"" that you tap while in a hockey stadium, and you are auto charged and have a beer delivered to your seat. No proof of concept required, this is obviously possible to implement. Yet it is arguably innovative. A prototype might be nice, though.

It isn't a race at all. Even a working LN is only economically suitable for some transactions. Plus it requires a serious upgrade in onchain capacity with any meaningful adoption. Simply put, LN does nothing to address the actual scaling of Bitcoin.

I confess that the real reason why I am around is that the cryptocurrency scene has provided an unending stream of comical stories that no writer could have made up: from the 2010 overflow bug to the IdiOTA cult, going through MtGOX, Neo&Bee, the Bitfinex haircut, the DAO hack and the Parity suicide, the two Satoshis ressurected, and much, much more..."
Segwit is 10% of bitcoin network. Bitcoin cash is also 10%. I'm fairly certain other 4000 nodes give zero fucks about bitcoin. 
"> The lightning network is economically useful even if the route finding is centralised.

The only topology for which path finding has a working solution has one big hub and every user with a payment channel for that hub.  Then the hub of course knows the state of all channels in real time, and path fining is trivial because every path has two hops with the hub in the middle.

Being centralized is a big flaw, because it takes away the only advantage of bitcoin.  The hub would have to comply with AML/KYC and would be able to censor any payment, without reason or explanation.  If that topology is OK, one might as well use PayPal, which would be much better in every aspect.

Another big problem with that topology is that the hub must provide funding, from its own pockets, for all outgoing channels; and the funding must be sufficient to cover all payments that each user may receive in (say) one day,  Now consider that the users are supposed to include thousands of merchants and services like Walmart, Starbucks, etc..  Where is the hub going to get enough coins to fund those channels?

"Because it's never been done before, and there is no real reason to believe the people behind Bitcoin Core are more talented than everyone that came before them and failed, or the dozens of teams working on the same problems with different projects (Raiden, Tangle, DAG, PoS).

Bitcoin solved the problems inherent in distributed systems by using PoW for write access and using a node software which learns and responds to network stimuli, LN promises to solve the same problems without PoW and without a hardened network ie. the same problems people were working on for decades before Satoshi solved them for the first time."
"In order to find a path from Alice to Zoe, the path-finding mechanism needs to know the current capacity of every channel, namely the channel's initial funding minus the net amount of LN payments sent through it so far.  

The path finder does not have to find an optimal path; any reasonable path would be OK.  Therefore, it does not need to know the exact channel capacities.  That is, if the net payment through a channel so far is 0.1275 BTC, it is OK if the path finder knows only that it is between 0.1 and 0.2 BTC.  

Even so, the path finder needs to know of any payment that is large enough to change that approximate balance; or, if many small payments are made through the channel, it must be notified every time they add up to a significant amount.

Therefore, every time Alice makes a significant payment to Zoe, she must promptly notify the path-finding server(s) about it.  If the payment went through a path of six hops, all six payments must be promptly reported to the path finder. 

The current implementation, IIUC, has a toy path finding algorithm that runs on every node, and keeps track of the current state of every channel.  Therefore, every node must be notified of every payment made by any user in the network.   If there were a million nodes, each making one significant LN payment per day, each node would have to receive and process one million notifications per day.  This is actually worse scaling than the original bitcoin network with SPV client wallets.

One could use a single central path finding server, or a few servers.  Either way, any such server would have to know about every significant payment made by every user.  So the original promise of confidentiality would be lost.

If some of those notifications are delayed or fail to reach a path finder, the latter will occasionally return a path that cannot, in fact, carry the desired payment. A failure rate of 1% may be high enough to drive users away.  

Moreover, once the path finder has chosen a path, the selected middlemen nodes must  ""freeze"" the relevant channels until the payment is negotiated and executed, or the negotiation fails.

The ""path finding problem"" is inventing an algorithm that would be decentralized, reliable,  and scale better than the original bitcoin network.  And would preserve the confidentiality of payments of the original LN concept.  It is not obvious that such an algorithm will ever be found..."

"Here's a comment from /u/duh_void from the post:

> Hopefully by this time next year we'll laugh at the days of $7 network fees.

Why does anyone think that LN will decrease fees? Imagine LN working exactly as promised and merchants adopting it. Users would be paying even higher Bitcoin fees because there would actually be people trying to use the network to open and close channels for LN instead of what most people use Bitcoin for now - moving to and from cold storage to HODL forever or sell for fiat.

People are not understanding the problems with the 1MB limit Core has refused to increase."

Bitcoin needs a scaling solution asap. If LN doesn't come soon and delivers what it promises I don't think bitcoin can compete with altcoins.
"Generally speaking, software terminology goes more like this:

Pre-Alpha: Everything done before alpha. This is your concept, idea, and prototyping phase.

Alpha: Features are still being added, but what's there is kinda usable. Can cause crashes and data loss. Bugs aplenty.

Beta: Feature complete version. All features are generally functional. Many bugs still around.

Release Candidate: Bugfixed beta version. If nothing critical shows up, will become the release version.

Release: As bugfixed as the schedule allows."
If a solution takes years to figure out then that solution is overcomplicated and should not be used. Keep it simple stupid! 
"> And, moreover, the LN is not just a software package or protocol. It is supposed to be a network -- millions of people using the protocol to make real payments, because they find it better than available alternatives. There is no reason to believe that such a network will ever exist, because the concept has many economic and usability problems that have no solution in sight.

Pure snakeoil."

"There is one important version left missing from your list, the ""gamma version."" The gamma version falls between the beta and production versions.  It represents a so-called complete and final version of the software that is distributed to general users which hasn't actually completed beta testing but is released anyway because of some scheduling, PR, management, or funding deadline that has to be met. This is especially true with new software releases or major software upgrades.  In gamma testing, the poor early adopters of the new software become the testers and validaters of the new software and complete the beta testing for the developers.

There are countless examples of users jumping on a new or major software release only to be totally frustrated by its dysfunctionality.  Recent examples include Windows 10 and iOS 10.  As a rule, I never do major software upgrades until months after the release when gamma testing has been completed by the early users.  This applies to Bitcoin software equally as it does to OS and apps."
"> They lack some essential parts, notably a decentralized path-finding mechanism that can scale to millions of users better than Satoshi's original Bitcoin payment network. And there is no evidence or argument indicating that such a mechanism is even possible.

Well, if a handful of big exchanges set up a lightning hub, and all customers of those exchanges set up a lightning channel towards those exchanges, we wouldn't really need any advanced routing algorithm.  It would not fulfill the ""decentralized promise"", but then again, even with perfect routing protocols in place it's nearly inevitable that in the end we'll all be connected towards the biggest lightning hubs, and not to the local coffee shop.

Still, there is the network effect - I don't think the ""lightning rollout"" will be nearly as fast as the ""segwit rollout"".

Not to forget that the participants actually will need to squeeze in an on-chain transaction to open the channel, which may be non-trivial."
"Hmm aren't Tor and the internet examples of decentralised route finding that can work at scale?

Also I'd argue that *decentralised* route finding is a secondary feature. The lightning network is economically useful even if the route finding is centralised."
"I've downloaded and ran the LN client about 7 months ago with the goal of seeing what kinds of things there was to poke at and just play around. My curiosity was where it was connecting, how it's testnet looked compared to a traditional TBTC network, etc.

What I found was not much working and a lot of stubbed or mocked-up components. I'm sure everything is implemented in there, somewhere."

Will you need to use an on chain transaction to open a lightning channel?

EDIT: I've tried right now and it worked. But I didn't had to open any channel. I guess the test wallet above is some kind of ""LN only"" account without private keys, I only have the BTC IOUs like in a bank account.

I have asked many times to see it, always crickets. The last I checked, LN used a flooding / gossip protocol which means it can be expected to scale worse than onchain Bitcoin and also be not at all private.  Do you know if they've even updated this or if they're still gossipping every channel state change to every other channel?"

For new people here please be aware, u/jstolfi was a major oponent of bitcoin since 2014., critical on every development or solution bitcoin presented. Tulips and all standard b.s. as well. He was (maybe stil is, can’t be botherd to check) moderator of r/buttcoin, an anti-bitcoin page. He wrote ugly letter to goverment when Winklewii applied for their bitcoin ETF claiming, among other negativity, bitcoin to be backed by nothing and a Ponzi scheme. This is just small sample of “favors” u/jstolfi did to bitcoin throughout the years. He is THE enemy of bitcoin.
LN is not strongly tied to bitcoin. If some other altcoin is more suitable to adopt LN, because of a required on-chain scaling, users will probably move on anyway.
Also see [these questions](https://gist.github.com/Swader/880c8eb27c38326290c842a543ec3913) they seem to be consistently dodging. I’ve tried to find out if I’m getting something wrong for so long, but no clarifications.

If and when there is standardized routing in place (even though it can not possibly be what is advertised), I would consider it alpha. But even that doesn't guarantee functionality, let alone market success.

People are having a hard enough time understanding and using Bitcoin wallets, which are completely fire and forget. Something that requires you to stay online in order to keep your funds safe, that requires locking your funds in a smart manner? It is not only going to be hub-and-spoke centralization, people are going to use functionally custodial systems which pretend they are not.

The technology is more suited to applications like decentralized casinos or CryptoKittens on the Ethereum network. But those would have a hard time existing in Bitcoin with its current limitations anyway.

You're wrong about this. I was told it's coming in 18 months. You'll see!
actually, in 18 months, it will be 18 months away, so really, 36 months...
TOR routing doesn’t have to take into account how much funds are within each channel across the path. It might use similar concepts, but that doesn’t mean it works the same.

No proof of concept required, this is obviously possible to implement. Yet it is arguably innovative. A prototype might be nice, though.

> I believe BCH has a good shot at becoming the most useful currency among its crypto friends, but posts like this make me reconsider my stay here.

Unlike Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin Cash is a minimally viable payment system -- but only as good as bitcoin was in 2014.  While the shared history and name with old Bitcoin give it a marketing advantage, technically it loses to many other cryptos,  even to Dogecoin -- because of its 10 minute **average** confirmation time.  

Even if it were to switch to 10 second interblock time (which may be politcally impossible), it would still not be good enough to compete with bank wires, Visa, PayPal, mPesa etc in their respective markets.   "
"> A proof of concept proves a concept that needs to be proven.

A proof of concept shows that something is feasible.

How does the beer get delivered given the inaccuracy of GPS inside large buildings? Those are some of the more challenging aspects of your proposal and if I were considering funding you those would be the kinds of things I would want to see addressed in a proof of concept build.

If you told me they are obviously possible to implement I would put my checkbook away and invite you to call me when you had something working.

OP's claim that LN is not even at the proof of concept stage yet is 100% accurate because they _haven't solved routing_.

"That's interesting, I was wondering if the channels used on the hops would be required to update the status of their channel.

The whole thing sounds like it would be subject to all kinds of race condition problems, because the information about any change of state of a channel needs to propagate across the network. Another node could make a transaction using a channel that the first node already used, possibly just using the funds up in channel, so the first transaction can't be transmited.

It seems like the only way it could work reliably is to have some kind of time lock, so transactions would be held until all nodes had the same information. Which would be really slow."

"I have an additional worry personally. The whole model basically scraps the 6 confirmations model and makes people accept transactions that are unconfirmed as if they were confirmed. This is inherently insecure. There’s literally nothing stopping me creating a LN channel, purposefully put zero network fees on the transaction the channel runs on, deplete the funds, then let the channel close. I not only had people foolish enough to accept unconfirmed transaction as legit, but I run the very real possibility that that settled channel will remain in the mempool and end up being dropped, allowing me a free double spend! The best part is that I am incentivized in doing so, which means you can assume many people will do this, leading to further mempool bloat, thus making the attack even more successful. If a wise person being attacked decides to make a child transaction using the funds from the zero network fee transaction to get his money, he needs to pay the fee 3 times. It’s a great model.

On top of it, a whale can abuse the shit out of the network topology and force people to close their channel by pinpointing specific channels and sending them all one side. And since the whale can send to himself, he can make those attacks very cheaply."

"Not sure why you were downvoted.. I agree their bullshit is fully mature almost to the point of being rotten -- like an aged cheese left out too long.

"To answer those questions:

1: You wouldn't use LN unless you plan on making three or more transactions over the channel. It's also possible (expected, really) for a channel to reach more than the people at the ends. Closing a channel is only necessary if the user wants to access the Bitcoin on the mainnet.

2a: LN can function as a mesh network and is designed to route around blockages. Nodes that charge excessive fees will be avoided in favor of nodes that are cheaper. With respect to KYC, I don't think it's enforceable on LN, in the same way that it's not enforceable on Bitcoin proper.

2b: The nature of this question suggests a serious misunderstanding of how LN works. LN channels are independent, and can close at any time without any consideration to any other channel. Nothing in this question is relevant.

3: In order:

* Channels can be funded by either or both of the participants. 
* LN channels can't be ""topped up"" in the usual sense. Interconnected node channels can be re-balanced, but the total amount in the channel is fixed.
* Some people will only need one channel. Others will have many to maximize their fee collection. I'd expect casual users will have one to three channels. No data behind that, mind, just my opinion.
* Due to the way LN routes payments, you won't need a channel to everyone you transact with. As long as one of your channels can find a route with sufficient funds, you're golden.
* Channels stay open until they are closed.
* A channel can be closed by either party whenever they want.
* You'd pay the closing fee when you need to use the Bitcoins outside LN, or when you don't want the channel open anymore for whatever reason.
* No, you won't need a 0.1 BTC channel for every Starbucks. Again, this part demonstrates a serious misunderstanding of how LN works.

4a: AFAIK channels won't close automatically, but you do have to be online to update the channel and monitor for fraud. So, practically speaking, being online is pretty much mandatory; I don't think there's much that can be done to change that. 

4b: All traffic should be encrypted, so blocking specifically LN traffic wouldn't really work. Plus, there's always Tor and/or VPN services to obfuscate traffic. Even if a node goes down permanently, no money is lost. Either party can close the channel and unlock the coins by broadcasting the last transaction to the Bitcoin network."
