They're going to kill us of course.  So what?
"Why would you need to destabilize it if you just outright own it? If they own the market it's not a threat.

Pandora's box has been opened. Just because a crypto becomes destabilized, doesn't mean the world would be willing to go back to fiat or fed coin or whatever. 

I think if they managed to acquire enough crypto to destabilize the world market they would just hodl it and spend it, because why bother risking destabilizing something you own... "
"This sub is extremely confusing...a few posts above yours people are calling bitcoin “barely usable digital gold” and now you’re saying it’s some existential threat to national currencies

This all while the rest of the subreddit keeps talking about how inept management is dooming bitcoin

Which is it? All these things can’t be true they’re inherently contradictory "
"> so they could easily conjure up digital dollars off the balance sheet 

They don't need to do it off the balance sheet.  They have infinite leverage.  During the financial crisis they conjured up $3 trillion in dollars via quantitative easing.  They are only now about to start slowly winding that down.

How it works:  They buy Treasury bonds & mortgage backed securities from member banks.  The banks get paid by a credit on their account with the Fed.  This account is used to settle up between banks and hold excess reserves at other times.  The banks now have more dollars they can loan out and make money from."
good point. i'd be curious to see if they managed to get away with it. I wouldn't be surprised also to find that satoshi nakamoto was part of the government (iEdit - i know the fed isn't part of the government) and therefore already having a lot of coins they might just be hodling. Anything is a possibility. i do personally think the dollar is on its last legs either way, dunno exactly what would replace it specifically
The wit and prose are amazing banter. I think you just proved a point right there. 
They're both Bitcoin and many of us have both.
"The trolls keep pretending they don't know what people on this sub mean by ""the real bitcoin"". It means ""following Satoshi's vision""."
"His apathy towards Putin and anti-American position is enough for Russia to manipulate him and feed him disclosures in their interest. They haven't fed him /r//bitcoin modlogs .

"They're pretty clearly creating artificial short-term demand, driven by the scarcity and lower likelihood to trade caused by inconvenient transaction times and fees.

That, and top-level executives directly commenting about it.  Jamie Dimon bashing it is just an excuse to bring it up.  JP Morgan is a huge investor.

Huge crashes and price volatility dissuade investors from getting into new projects.  The higher Bitcoin goes, and the lower it crashes, the longer it will take before people start looking back into it.

Additionally, trying to market the idea of ""digital gold"" in the first place is blatant bank marketing.  It benefits no one for Bitcoin to be a sluggish, high-cost way of handling transactions, except for  banks.  It will always be easier and less complicated to use a credit card for 99% of transactions because of it."
Bitcoin may end up like AOL did. The first real modern wave of internet usage, but clearly better options evolved. Those better options may be alt coins such as LTC, VTC, BCH, XMR, etc.

This is true but he is credible source of information on the dirty secrets of the government so I kind of root for him.
Fuck off cunt
Satoshi, whose vision was for us to follow His word, and interpret the white paper as our One central document to guide us to his perfect Vision. Thank you Satoshi! 
It is almost as if different people have different opinions. Who would have thought... Of course it might sound strange coming from /r/Bitcoin where if you are not in line with the party's position you get banned.
I'll check these out. Thank you!

">If people own gold standard notes, they actually own some of the gold you are holding 

Do you actually believe this, come on."
"I'm not sure what your point is.

Also your bet is fucking retarded. Either bitcoin becomes a reserve currency and I win 100k satoshi or bitcoin is destabilized and you win something about as useful as Zimbabwe dollars. "
What books have you read that you'd recommend?
Not just destabilize it but cut it off completely. If people own gold standard notes, they actually own some of the gold you are holding and it's hard for you to inflate the currency. Disconnect that and you get to own all the gold and inflate the paper.

"Let me pose an alternative scenario.

Why would they go through the trouble of manipulating cryptos out of existence if they could just ban them?

Yeah bitcoin is censorship resistant, tor, privacy, blah blah.

If it's banned, legitimate businesses can't transact in crypto. That would be enough to stop it dead in its tracks.

Unless of course people refused to obey this legislation and then you're right back to the scenario of forcing people to use fiat at the point of a gun.

If the US government decided to manipulate a particular crypto out of existence, it would just be replaced with another one."
They're going to slow it down and back it up. But that's all they're going to be able to do. It's just going to wear them down as new and better ones keep coming. Eventually their resources will be depleted. It's just a matter of time. But everyone is going to suffer until they are beaten.
"Like I said before, Pandora's box had been opened. People understand what a decentralized crypto currency means and the moment traditional fiat world reserve currencies start to destabilize, crypto is coming next. You won't be able to force people to use fiat except at the point of a gun. I'm no saying some governments aren't going to try to do that, but that can only continue so long.

We agree that crypto vs. fiat changes the game. I'm just saying that if a government controls a massive supply of a reserve crypto currency they have already won. They don't need to destabilize it because everyone else in the world is using the thing they control. Rather than release a ton of crypto that people could pick up for pennies on the dollar (so to speak) wouldn't they rather just release a tiny amount to complete the mission at hand? All the while collecting back a ton of it in taxes. 

Let's say a single government controlled all the world's gold. Do you think they would try to destabilize a gold standard? 

Now let's say China or Russia or some other power controls massively more crypto than USA. Do you think they are just going to roll over while the USA tries to force the rest of the world back on the dollar?

I don't disagree with a lot of what you're saying. I just think you need to think a little deeper along the same lines. Take a few more thought experiments down all the way to their apocalyptic conclusions. "
It can be surprisingly hard to manipulate a currency. Soros made a bunch of his money when the UK tried to prop up the pound against reality. Trying to crash cryptos might work but it might just make someone very rich.

If Bitcoin bounced back from the 2014 crash then it can bounce back from anything.
You try to mock the idea that someone signed up for the original vision as some kind of religious thing but even this way it would make to call Bitcoin Cash the real Bitcoin. You can claim that Core's vision is the better Bitcoin and we can debate that but there is no doubt which fork follows the original vision.

But you guys have been telling people BCH is bitcoin. So when people are talking about Bitcoin we need to ask the date to know the ticker symbol they are referring to?

How and why do you think they are artificially inflating price?
Authoritarian schemes always degrade over time. Its human nature.
I don't think Assange cares much about Putin's interest but he is definitely anti-American and targets the US disproportionately while ignoring worse governments. And I am not even an American. That being said I have yet to find something Assange leaked that turned out to be false. The guy is credible.
"I would strongly prefer statements like this not be made. All it does is piss off powerful people who can make the burgeoning crypto-economy suffer. This statement solves nothing and only creates cause for governmental action. I lost some respect for Mr. Assange with this one.
We must all be smarter than this as we work to build our new ecosystem."

Asschang is still a Russian shill.
My son worships Assange.  I think he's a bit of a drama queen, but I see value in Wikileaks.  That being said, he's an idiot for making a statement like this.  Poking the bear is only a good idea if you're badder than the bear, and in this instance, he ain't badder than the bear.     
This is what Bitcoin is about.

Hahahahaha. The burns oh my god. Julian you are a god damn hero.
Epic.
Question: Can wikileaks cash in those returns?
Big thanks to Julian assange, am happy his involved in this revolution...
Am I only one who thinks govt will now be pissed off with BTC and might try controlling it niw
Julian is the greatest shitposter of our time.
"Epic post.
They won't let him go anywhere - swimsuit models have to bring him sandwiches.
They still can't stop the crypto."
It warms my heart to think that had the fiat scammers had just an ounce of foresight and given the users of their system just a little bit more freedom and managed their currency with just a little more integrity, they might have been able to stave off bitcoin for a long time, but they just can't help themselves!

When he says bitcoin does he mean BTC or BCH?
I mean, he is. He can be right and still be an asshole.
"Well...
Title says 2010.
BCH was created 2 months ago.

Putin and Legarde have some.
But that means that they pay for the creation of crypto ecosystem and make a lot of people rich which means that after they dump everything someone will immediately try to rebuild but this time it will be easier.
Not all leakers are heroes. Assange only leaks what is in Putin's interest.
"What's the difference between fiat and owning all the bitcoin... Why go through the trouble.

They would never risk betting on any particular crypto coin. Why bother? They have guns. "
"You overestimate the people with power so much it's funny.

They are not realizing and we are pulling the rug under their feet. Even the  shit SegWit1x coin is immune to these kind of state actors. They are old news. And I have many examples of this, I'm happy to discuss over PM."
"Because central banks hijacking the project, artificially inflating price, and jamming up transactions/turning it into barely functional ""digital gold"" is great for the price short-term.  He's obviously stoked about that."
crypto isn't the only thing threatening the us dollar. the petrodollar is dying and yuan and rubles are being used more in international trade. this will only add to inflation.
People in the crypto world are incredibly enthusiastic, and clueless, about how insignificant crypto actually is as a store of value in the world currently.
I am a Canadian/Belgium/Israeli/Chinese/Portugal shill. Makes a lot more money then just being a russian shill. 
Thank you
It depends how many of their Bitcoins they haven't sold. We know they received 4025 at the public address, but we don't know how much they received to their anonymous donation addresses, or how much they've kept.

As a fellow Australian, I objectively disagree. The Brits have significantly better banter than us. 
"I'm not sure if to be flattered by being called ""a typical redditor"" after a couple of posts =)

The issue here is that you have exposure to British media, which, as you point here, is anti-EU, and not after second referendum, and that helps you in balancing the information you get from the media. Now, I'll take your word on the state of the British media, but C-Span is an American network, and our discussion here is about that network. American people do not have balanced exposure to opinions, and so cannot parse away the bias here the same way you do.

Our discussion was about whether or no C-Span is biased, let's go back to that. You can easily convince me that they are not biased: if you can point me to a few quality pieces they have authored which are praising Trump, praising the tremendous positive contribution of Putin to the Russian society, pro-Brexit, anti-EU, and/or questioning whether climate change is man-made or natural. I am just asking for a few, not for 50% of their articles.

"Once again your analysis is more ignorant and boring than even the analysis of many of the newspapers I despise. It's just typical redditor anti-press rebel-without-a-cause bollocks.

> In the 3rd title, it is ""Theresa May"", ""Won't say"", ""Second referendum"". The media is trying to make the reader take the existence of ""Second referendum"" as given

That's simply not true. She was asked a hypothetical question. Again, a wide range of mainstream and independent outlets reported her response to this question. The majority of these outlets *do not want a second referendum*, despite your bias against the press.

> no one should be forced to disclose what they voted

She wasn't being asked how she voted. Plus she was a key campaigner for Remain, so everyone already knew how she voted.

>  WHAT second referendum? What is the meaning of having a 2nd referendum?

Err, if you followed british politics this wouldn't be such a mystery for you. It's the Lib Dems' platform that there be a second referendum once we know what the deal with the EU would look like. That's neither Labour's nor the Tories' position.

> Are referendums to be repeated until people vote in a way that the media defines as ""correct""?

You do realise that the british media has been rabidly anti-EU for decades? Our press is considerably to the right of your press.

Not correct. Validity isn't defined by full non-mining nodes, u can install whatever software on them and create any number of nodes for pretty low cost, it's not Sybil-proof. Rules are defined by majority of a hahsrate in Bitcoin, like Segwit was activated only after reaching NYA"
