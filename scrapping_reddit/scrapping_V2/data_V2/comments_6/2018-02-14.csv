Oh sick idea! People could make a group worldwide, make stencils, and blam stuff all over the place at the same time! 
That would be really neat

It looks like the green color is just that artist's signature but it's all good :)
can we get a picture without the dude in front of it?
It was more a play on words since its bank related art...
People would cover that code with their own so fast.
address: Rue Legouvé in the 10th, close to the canal
Fair point. It may not be that frequent but probably enough. I guess the artist could have an online presence where donations are listed but that would allow easier tracking.

When has stupid money ever been something to base your ideals upon?
"""Bitcoin"" is a more than satisfying name for BTC to the large majority of crypto users. [The idea that Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin is laughable to the overwhelming majority of CryptoCurrency users outside of /r/btc](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7x8sox/a_legitimate_crypto_doesnt_require_itself_to_be/?utm_content=comments&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=CryptoCurrency)"
Shame it is low-res. I'll see if I can get them to post a higher-res version.
Do you know what a joke is?
I second that
This looks to be the paper-pasting style of graffiti, I think.
Really what I was thinking, but I thought a more diplomatic post would bring more love...
Like 99% of all people who buy coins do.
">  1000%

which is the same as the 50% it dropped "
"we've tried various names and nothing's satisfying to the fans of this new shitfork except to use the name ""Bitcoin"" with no clarification and to use the symbol ""BTC"" as if that's what it used to mean-- *that's* what's causing the brand confusion"
"One year ago, 1 BTC was $1000, half  a year ago, around $4000, last week $8000.   
Not sure why you so desperately focus on the craziness of early December."
Price isn't the only thing that's important. In fact, it's only important if you treat crypto as an investment.
Not really you are delusional 
after it rose by 1000% in a few months more lol lol lol
It belongs there now.
After the price dropped by 50% in 1 1/2 months lol
Keep rapping to it hippies. Banks are here to stay and if u think bitcoin will replace fiat wich I can use everywhere instantly with 9 commission or 0 electricity or 0 devices u are delusional kids
i would definitely buy a print of this.
where exactly is that?
They won’t go quietly into the night.

It's not only about the profit **you** can make from it but more about the technology behind it.

We don't speak reason to zealous lot! I got downvoted to hell for saying that whales are deciding BTC value at the moment. Like it or not banks & fiat will stay. If crypto were to really replace it, then we'll have to look beyond the fiat value of the currency. And many people fail right there. If one wants to Hodl to get rich quick he's the one ruining the crypto for everyone. 
So it means you got all your fiat in cash? Or you doesn't have a bank account? Without electricity, no casual money too my friend. No electricity, no society.

Bunch of brainwashed losers.
True, but, Crypto may replace Fiat. IMO, the graffiti is not about banks.
But why as a customer do I still need my bank? I can be my own bank and bypass them completely with crypto. Perhaps I could still use the bank for a house mortgage or maybe for share trading but other than that the main banking functions like deposits/withdrawals/paying/receiving etc we won't need. Perhaps they might be still in use in a custodial sense (they think they can store the Bitcoins more securely than the average Joe), but that remains to be seen.
bs no way this banksy, he hates anything to with capitalism
"What I'd suggest you do is give the device an activation code that will only allow it to work once it's been registered on your site with a pre-defined cryptographic key that will need to be re-registered every time it's plugged in to a new device. 

This will also give you an opportunity to display on the activation webpage at the time specific details of current known hacks. ""Did your device come with a scratch card seed? It's fraudulent"". ""This device has been previously registered. If you have not registered before please follow these steps to reset your device"". 

That will prevent these low-tech attacks as well as creating a channel to communicate with new users who may have bought from a 3rd party seller, showing them how to properly reset the device before continuing. "
Go take a look at the reviews for the bitcoin.com wallet on the iOS App Store. Tons of people who tried to transfer their Bitcoin into the apps bcash wallet. 
Bitcoin is BCH when it has more hashrate than BTC.
[deleted]
"I hope these suckers actually go use your ATMS, break em off for all they're worth Roger.  Keep the scam alive.  What's the markup on your machines lol.

Just swung by the one near me; bitcoin is marked up over $2500 per coin.  But I'm sure yours wont be massively marked up right?  A sucker is born every minute, and they love bcash."
"Not really, lead and gold are two completely different things that have never related and have no common elements or history. BTC and BCH both come from the same place (same history) and are only recently making changes that would see them have different names.

It would be better to say you'd sell me some (fools) gold. But Blockstream shills aren't smart enough to think of that, go buy more down votes. "
"Yup just what I thought, bitcoin is marked up over $2500

current price 11,220 at the  atm"
Actually the bitcoin.com app was brigaded by /r/Bitcoin, [source](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7e7n15/this_scam_is_unacceptable_lets_do_something_about/) and [source](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7e98o4/please_give_5_minutes_from_your_time_to_downvote/). Bitcoin.com also have a [handy guide](https://walletsupport.bitcoin.com/article/110/i-accidentally-sent-btc-to-my-bch-wallet) to restore any BTC sent to BCH wallet. I asked for evidence of someone BUYING bitcoin cash accidentaly thinking its BTC.
"Nodes don't know they're *your* funds. All they know is the previous hop, next hop, and amount.

So yes, trustless."
"Its a shame to put blame on users, but that's just how crypto universe is right now.  You are responsible for your private keys, your passphrases, your wallet, your backups.  There are a million details you need to watch out for to make sure you don't get your wallet emptied out.

If you are so careless as not to know the coin you are buying, you are destined to lose them one way or another anyway.

As an aside - accidentally buying the 'real' bitcoin is not a bad thing either :)"
That's insane! Somebody trying to make some money off some suckers who don't know what the price is.
Actually, looking at the site posted above, most in my area are 8, 10, 12, 15% to buy, one is -2% to sell. 
"yup, these atms are a joke.  This is with coinucopia.io or whatever it's called.  This one by my house is the only one I've ever checked and it's always been crazily marked up.

The one thing that I noticed and thought was cool (even tho it helps the scam)

It says ""Our Bitcoin Price: $11.22/mBTC (1000 mBTC = 1 BTC)""

I like that it lists the price in mBTC, but again.... that markup...  lol"
"I am working on a compact, DIY lasercut ATM:

more info coming soon (calling it the BCH-BOX)"
"I think maybe they raised it when the fees shot up, and haven't backed to down because, well, people are greedy.

Edit: actually, maybe they're the ones flooding the mempool with high fee txs"
I noticed this ATM about a year ago, and was floored by the markup, it definitely isn't something new.
You, on the other hand seem to lack any argument whatsoever ...
Bitcoin (BCH)
lol no.  People don't really use them, the markup is insane.  The one near me is selling bitcoin for 11,220 today
if it was true bitcoin then it shouldnt be necessary to write in brackets.
Your argument is both technically wrong and irrelevant. 
I was being sarcastic
He's making a simple point that anyone would understand.  You're very Smart (Dumbass)
Go ahead, I won't try to stop you. I normally use the tickers BTC BCH BTG or BTCD for each of those anyway, but you're free to do what you want. 
"Lead and Gold are both energy condensed  to a slow vibration. But that another topic.

I like BCH.  I like BCH because this is a open source, and decentralized environment where everyone can participate, and add new ideas in anyway they see fit.

I'm still a BTC ""shill"" because I like the ideas of the lightning network.  Adding more MB per transaction is only buying time, if this technology actually takes on mainstream adoption.

Just to ineterate how much of a Bitcoin shill I am, I don't even care if BTC survives; because if something better gets adapted, it will all have started from Bitcoin, and Satoshi's ideas."
Didn’t say he was a deity.  I’m sorry the word vision triggered you so much.  Maybe you should figure out why that happened?
"I have no skin in the game but wanted to throw in my 2 satoshis. Imagine an alien was monitoring the earthly network traffic. They would see that at some point in the past, rules were changed to ensure that only block up to 1MB could be produced. They would then see the blocks fill up. After some time they would see that there are now 2 chains, one with larger possible block size, and one where 10% of users are sending funds to “anyone can spend” addresses, but everyone isn’t claiming them...and there is now an extra chunk of data tacked onto the block.  
Which do you honk the alien would consider the “original” chain. I don’t think it’s as clear as either side thinks."
I'm assuming the markup is customizable, just like an actual ATM.
lol out loud 
This was intentional. 
I wish people would stop this Anton Scalia originalism bullshit argument. “The closest one to Satoshi’s vision” my ass. He’s not a deity FFS. 
Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin
I just went by the one by my house (coinucopia.io)  CA USA  They are selling bitcoin for 11,220... over $2500 markup..... good god
I think you mean Ethereum (BTC)
Cool, I’ll just start calling Bitcoin Gold and Bitcoin Diamond by the name Bitcoin then. No problems there. 
Are you kidding?  If you could get a few suckers to use one, you could make a killing.  I don't think people would actually use them tho.  The one near me is marking up bitcoin over $2500 lol.  I've never seen anyone use one tho haha
"They (coinucopia.io) mark bitcoin up by over $2500.  He'll make that money back in just a few transactions if people are stupid enough to buy from one.

Yeah, I know Rogers machines wont do that.  lol  I will certainly go check if the one near me adds BCH or hopefully someone who finds one will, and we'll see what Rog's BCH markup is....."
I never got that before! Awesome.
Paid Blockstream shill
Not trustless. You have to trust that your channel partner will route your funds on your behalf. As you point out, he can refuse.
"Where have you tried buying BTC or BCH and it was not called what it is? All of the places that I know of that you can buy it from call it specifically BTC or BCH.

Even the places that same people say are supposedly misleading people like bitcoin.com don't sell BCH as BTC, they say it is essentially Bitcoin in some articles because it is, but they never say that it equals BTC. "
or do all of that stuff and call it something that's not easily confused with btc
Where do I get some Bitcoin (XMR)?
"I truly don't understand how people can tolerate this twat. Attempting to gaslight the entire community for his own personal benefit.

I've said it before, and I'll say it again: **If BCH is truly superior and could stand on its own merits, supporters wouldn't need to cause labeling confusion.**"
Mmmmmm herb and cheese...
Is that different from Ethereum (BCH)?
">  Bitcoin segwit is valid according to the protocol of bitcoin, they are the same chain.

From the white paper: ""We define an electronic coin as a **chain of digital signatures**""

SegWit segregates the signatures so they're no longer a part of the block and can be discarded ergo BTC with SegWit is NOT Bitcoin as defined in the white paper. QED."
"Can you send one of them to Chattanooga?

I can maintain it for you =P"
More bcash support? Why the hell not 
"Ok, went by the atm near me, it was one of those coinucopia.io machines.

""Our bitcoin price $11.22 mBTC (1000mBTC = 1BTC)"" = 11, 220 per BTC

Todays current BTC price =  8,671 for a mark up of $2,549  

I'm not sure what the percentage markup that is but you have to be kidding me.  Pay an extra $2500  per BTC

I really don't think you as a bitcoin casher are out there buying BTC in the first place and I don't think that if you are you're buying it from a damn ATM machine.  You guys complain about fees all damn day long and you're going to pay a 3% markup to use an ATM?  I don't believe you.  I also doubt very much that you are actually getting a 3% markup...  

But whatever, you and your cronies here just keep downvoting and keep pretending you guys can't wait to get out there and use Rogers god damn BCH machines.  You guys lie blatantly all day, why would today be any different.

Edit:  I'll upload the picture of the ATM screen if you like."
Why is it named Bitcoin Cash? Bitcoin Cash is the fork.

Wtf bitcoin subreddit just blocked me on my first comment. Thats stupid.  Im new still learning. I guess it was because i put a referral link. But you could explain it instead of banning a person on their first mistake.
In their defense, it clearly states that as a rule violation (bullet point 6 - No referral links in submissions.) in their side panel. They have a long history of only giving users a single chance.
When I hear Bcash, I think b!tch cash... just sayin lol

"> Additionally, the withdrawal option is marked as ""coming soon"". 

The phrase you got when you set the account up can be imported into any BIP39 compatible wallet"
There is, when you are logged in you can enable/disable any currencies you want. It is entirely possible to only accept BCH for instance. =)
Bitpays big contribution wasn't letting merchants accept crypto, it was letting merchants accept crypto but get PAID in fiat. Coinbase's new platform is very welcome, but doesn't do that. At least not yet.
Lagging behind it seems
Half a month delay, meh, it's not too bad for a large org

why does cheapair's coinbase merchant portal still say BTC only?  Is this coinbase commerce simply a wallet for merchants seperate from coinbase's merchant payment portal, or is coinbase choosing to roll this out to one merchant at a time?

Hello Bitpay, how are you today?
"Very positive development!

Just tried this out. Straightforward and easy to set up. You are given a backup phrase to recover your funds. It doesn't appear there are any fees to use this service, but this is most likely because there is no crypto to fiat conversion option yet. Additionally, the withdrawal option is marked as ""coming soon"". Accepting BTC, BCH, ETH, and LTC is enabled by default and it doesn't appear there is a way to add or remove currencies."
