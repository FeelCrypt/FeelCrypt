"If nobody verified, 51% of miners could inflate the money supply without anyone else noticing. How could anyone know if nobody verified? Since there are people who run full nodes, there are people rejecting invalid blocks.

Since block weight of 4000000 is now consensus rule, people will reject any transaction in block that has higher block weight than 4000000. Because of people rejecting such transactions. This is why hard forks are dangerous - everyone has to agree to change the rules."
The question is where do you get the data from. If you get it from some semi-trusted source (you believe they won't DoS you), then what you describe might really be more efficient. Bitcoin Core assumes no trust and thus verification must be real time, so people can't DoS it by sending it invalid transactions/blocks - those will be rejected and misbehaving peers banned real-time.
"> everyone has to agree to change the rules.

everyone will never agree to anything.

realistically your keys are backwards and forwards compatible that's what is important. if you need a node you just upgrade. "
"> If nobody verified, 51% of miners could inflate the money supply without anyone else noticing. 

This is not true, if no one was verifying then there would be no users, just 5 or so competing interests need to verify. they could all be miners. 

the incentives keep miners honest and the bigger the network grows the greater the incentive. 

your node is not keeping the network secure. "
"I guess you mean 10 different crypto currencies - correct me if you meant something else.

Ideally you would run full node for each of them. In case you view some of them as buy once and hodl, you could run it only when buying and then delete the node (you don't need to run it when not receiving transactions).

Or if the value is too small, you could skip that step. Or just try to cross-check the chain of lower-valued coins from various sources."
"Invalid blocks can get highest difficulty in various scenarios: misconfiguration, bugs, fork events (like 1X vs 2X).

E.g. if one believes 1x is the real Bitcoin but miners think 2x is the real Bitcoin, they could mine wrong coin for a while.

To put it in extreme situation: if nobody did full verification, 51% of miners could inflate the money supply and nobody would notice - nobody would be able to notice without verification."

"So if I want to buy a pizza I need to open a channel to the pizza shop, send a transaction, close the channel. I'm not going to use the channel more than once because I'm ordering something else next time. One simple on-chain transaction would be far better.

The logical move is to add routers between me and the various suppliers so I can maintain one open channel to the router instead. Without routers lightning is very nearly useless."
Why aren't 90% of transactions being sent through LN then? Why don't exchanges support LN?
"I don’t see how that’s any different than the way people here respond to pro-Segwit people here.

Now, the mods over there are far worse, so if that’s what you’re talking about, then I definitely agree with you. I just think the people are a mixed bunch on both subs. It’s mostly new people who don’t even know how a blockchain works.

I recently listened to the [Waking Up podcast: #101 — Defending the Republic](https://overcast.fm/+Ic2jAJ-HAhttps://overcast.fm/+Ic2jAJ-HA), in which Cass Sunstein and Sam Harris talk about group polarization. It’s very interesting and explains the r/bitcoin r/btc divide very well.

The tldr is, when people get together in groups, you would expect the group to reach a consensus near the middle of all of their opinions. But, when you have groups that begin to lean to one side or another (or a fracture in the group occurs) they actually come to consensus on the extreme, rather than the middle.

The why is, the people in the middle are no longer hearing the arguments from the people on the other side. This makes them shift towards the extreme, thus shifting the middle of the group to the extreme."
"Yes but ""centralized off chain transactions are fine"" is a statement that goes against everything Bitcoin stands for. "
Nope. The only reason any altcoin is enjoying any success right now is the *failure* of BTC, especially when the altcoin is just BTC without the sabotage.
For everything else there is the real Bitcoin. 
OK now that it says MB and not GB your comment makes sense. I see your point. As a developer myself I really can't see an increase in block size a viable solution to scaling.
That's how it's supposed to work. Doesn't mean that's how it will work. It's completely possible that the Core chain and 2x will continue to exist after the fork.

"I support the idea of unbanking the banks, but why will I not get out of a centralized monetary system if I only think ROI? 

You might be right. I am far from out of it currently. If it happens within the next 50 years then I would say it goes quickly. Some might be able to do it, but I doubt I am one of them.

Currently Bitcoin is crushing any competition in terms of users and value and is without doubt the dominant coin. It makes sense to me that it is the most likely candidate to ""*work*"" at replacing the existing monetary system. If I was to switch then I would question if there aren't other altcoins out there that might be better, but that has the exact same amount of uncertainty to it? As you say, there is an ""*if it works*"" element in there. So does all altcoins. It first needs to tackle the biggest cryptocurrency contender, and then it can take on the monetary system.

"Good question!

After Bitcoin Cash's low fees, its [0-conf](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=423.msg3819#msg3819) is its most coveted feature!

A merchant simply observes the unconfirmed tx knowing that the nodes propagating the tx will reject any subsequent double spend attempt. The merchant is free to hand over the goods immediately knowing the tx will be mined in the very next block. Double spends are rather difficult to achieve in the absence of RBF and congestion. The merchant accepts the small risk in return for simply a stellar user experience! The bar tender sells more beer in a given shift!"

I don't quite understand how Lightning network can help me pay for coffee in one shop and a magazine in another. Or how a company will be able to pay 1000 of its workers in bitcoin. You still need that on-chain capability. I brought this up in /r/bitcoin but I wasn't smart enough to understand the answers, honestly.
The simple explanation is that back then, nobody knew the earth was round.  They didn't know it until somewhat recently historically.  So if your point is that the Bible itself is an indicator of accepted knowledge at that time, then you're correct.   People most likely thought the earth was flat in Jesus time.  
"There was a claim about some ""central router"" or ""client/server"", which does not exist. Payments will be routed obviously.

Asking the right questions there
Not what I heard, one person only has control of what actually gets added into the code, you can't just have random coder add something unless that person (don't know the name though) allows it. That is to me very much centralised decision making in the code already, and then LN completes it fully.
Yeah...right...who would **actually** buy a multi billion dollar market cap coin with is consistently in the top 5 for market cap AND volume? Who would **actually** buy into the original value proposition of Bitcoin? 
No, he bought it at 200 and at 300. He most likely sold at 900 for 300%-350%.
"My point is that someone said ""a Bible that says the earth is flat"" meaning a book people follow with devotion, and someone got butthurt that his favorite book was mentioned in the same phrase as flat Earth."
"You won't get out of centralised system because you seem to concentrate on ROI only, which makes me think (and please correct me if I wrong) that you are holding Core's BTC and not BCH? Amd I right? If everyone did the same and thinks the same, guess where all the FOMO leads to? Yup... anyone (and most people do see this only) looking at ROI they end up in Core's SegWit system, then when one day they want to use it, they will have to use it in Lighting, which sucks them right back in into centralised system.

You can't looks at Fiat value as clue what system SHOULD replace existing monetary system, because if you don't look at working principles first, you will be sucked right back in into centralised system. Thats how."

0AD is not so prehistoric as you might think, there are dinasties in China that date to 2070 BC, the great wall had 700 years when Jesus was born. Mayas already had cities with monumental structures for 500 years. Heck, the Roman empire had conquered almost all of Europe over 100 years earlier. So Jesus would need to be in orbit to see just the Kingdoms of the empire he lived in, a tad higher to include China and have x-ray vision to see the Mayans the other side of the world.

"Imagine this beautiful scenario:

Miners switch over to any currency that actually processes transactions. The transaction time is now close to not processing anything anymore.

The way 2X will work is there won't be a fork. The 1X chain will die off with little to no hashpower.

problem is with people's perception... if they keep using the Bitcoin name and call it decentralised, people will get sucked in no matter who the developers are.

"But as long as I have an option of staying on chain I don't need to use layer 2. If that option remains then only certain layer 2 situations can be an issue and you can decide to not use them for example.

"The intent is not to misinform anyone.  I've been here since Jan 2012.   I remember a time when every single person on the Core dev team said bitcoin was a decentralized peer to peer cash payment system.  They said miners were entitled to be selfish and vote with their hashpower to make decisions for the Bitcoin ecosystem.  

They said forks were appropriate when a large % of the ecosystem disagreed with decisions being made.  I was here.  I saw it with my own two eyes.  I have since watched them evolve away from that.   And that's okay.  They feel Bitcoin as it was designed, is no longer what they like.  So they're making a coin that doesn't match the White Paper, and therefore qualifies as the alt coin.

But nobody here is trying to lie to anyone.  There are some fanatics who say stupid shit like Greg Maxwell is the Devil, or Roger Ver sucks at the nipple of Satan.  People here just want an un-censorable bitcoin that is decentralized, cheap, and fast.  It's not decentralized if transactions are forcibly pulled off the block chain into 3rd party hubs run by centralized companies.  Not only does it introduce trust into what is supposed to be a trustless system, but it also creates single points of failure that can be shut down at any time.   

***On multiple levels, these things are literally the opposite of why Bitcoin was created***

Verbatim.  The total and complete opposite.  Why do I see that, but you don't?

Less than 1% of the worldwide Bitcoin userbase will ever see our conversations here.  And they are the ones who will decide.  They simply want Bitcoin to be fast, cheap, and decentralized.  So they will simply migrate to the fork that provides this.  Brian Armstrong controls a massive % of the Bitcoin userbase and BitPay controls 99% of the Bitcoin merchant world ... and you guys just blacklisted both of them a couple weeks ago.  

Really smart move."
"> But as long as I have an option of staying on chain

Right. And my whole point is that option degrades **quickly** with a restricted block size, forcing people onto L2 for convenience/cost reasons.

"Actually it does, Fiat will go away if LN is mass adopted, banks will create their own crypto anyway, and they will all work like LN (which makes me believe this is why LN and Core want these atomic swaps, so they can convert from bankers coins into SegWit coins, and still be in centralised system that bankers can regulate).

Bankers already rule the world, and if they get control of the Bitcoin name, and use that to suck people into Lighting, they will again... and this same battle to get out of centralised system will have to start all over again... question is, how long will it take for people to figure out they are duped?"
You don't need a global government to regulate LN hubs.
"**bold test**

sweet... thanks a lot, I won't use caps any more :-)

oh and, correct, SegWit is still decentralised, but this is not usable for masses, so base decentralised layer becomes useless if its not possible for everyone to use it.

Core will not provide users with decentralised system, we already had that with Bitcoin... they fucked it up."

I agree that a situation where layer 2 is the only bitcoin is a problem. I don't see layer 2 combined with on chain transaction as a problem. There are plenty of situations where that could be a good thing.
"> Bankers already rule the world, and if they get control of the Bitcoin name

Sure, but that is a *if* and it won't happen."
Globally? Yes, you do. 
Well I agree that Core is a problem. And there is a possibility that we can reach a situation where bitcoin is broken for general purpose if they are allowed to do exactly what they want. But currently we are not there. Which is why I hope, but sadly doubt, that 2x will dissolve Core.
"> Nobody wants that. Segwit is not that. LN is not that. Some sidechains could be that, and I sure as hell would stay away from them.

See?  Now we're talking like non-idiots about the actual issues.  

> Also I didn't blacklist anyone.

The camp you associate with strongly did.  Publicly.  Last week.  Right there on Bitcoin.org.   Listen there are good people on both sides.  I suppose its possible some people got corrupted from money like the conspiracy theorists over here claim.  But I really think its a ""comfort zone"" thing.  

I think its very possible for Greg to be under the influence of powerful investors and not let their interests seep into the Bitcoin code.  But in general, I'm just not comfortable with blockstream (or anyone) paying developers and having a say in where the code goes.  You should know full well thats a recipe for corruption if there ever was one.  Its total conflict of interest, dangerous, and has no place in Bitcoin.  Seriously.  

Layer 2 services for Bitcoin are important.  And people here support Lightning!  They just dont get why on-chain has to be intentionally crippled.   The risks are being overstated, which comes across dishonest, and that breeds conspiracy theories going back to Blockstream.  Its a shitty muddy situation but there are valid concerns from normal people over here."
Thanks!

"Yeah, honestly it doesn't matter what people call it. I don't want to get into that anyway. I was just trying to show why some people call it the real Bitcoin. As long as it is a peer to peer cash system that provides the utility we are looking for, it could be called anything. 

Anyway, I am glad I was able to sharpen your understanding on the difference between a POW based system (on chain) and a non-POW based system (L2). If you learned something new today, my job is done. :]

"> Bitcoin Cash can provide this very thing.

Yes, indeed it can. But there are other coins out there that might be better than Bitcoin Cash. Why not use them?"
"> there is technically no good reason not to just call it Bitcoin.

Technically - sure. But there is more to it than that. People will call Bitcoin Cash for Bitcoin Cash as that's how it was launched. It is the name people was presented, and then that *is* the name.

But since Bitcoin was launched there has been tremendous development and a lot of new coins have been issued. Since Bitcoin Cash clearly isn't the dominant coin, but a small coin among a sea of other coins - why aren't we looking into the other coins instead? More anonymous coins and so on. Why do you prefer Bitcoin Cash over the other coins available? "
Changing works sure, but there is a fee. the fee is fine for people that got in early, but how about those that got in late? They won't be able to get lot of coin, their value won't increase, but they will still need to pay high fee and then again to convert... it won't work for masses... so why go into this system in the first place? Bitcoin is meant to be usable by everyone, Core don't want this... Bitcoin Cash can provide this very thing... and this is why I am backing it with my own money. I want it to succeed.
"When you take it out of layer 2 in 2-3 years, and you can only do so through a Goldman Sachs LN hub which automatically turns over all of your personal info to the Feds as well as subtracts your ""capital gains"" tax and their oh-so-generously-low fees from your withdrawal, don't say nobody warned you."
"> In all honesty I am very convinced there are better crypto currencies out there than Bitcoin.

That is because the properties that have made Bitcoin great have been eroded and it is now rigged as a settlement system. It does not function as peer to peer cash anymore. So yes, you are right, there are far better coins out there. 

Bitcoin Cash is what Bitcoin once was, what bitcoin **claims** to be. The more you learn the more you will see, Bitcoin is an imposter coin masquerading as the original peer to peer cash system but bankers are turning it into everything BUT that. 

Bitcoin Cash is the original Bitcoin with the right rules, the peer to peer cash system is restored. It shares the same genesis block and POW so if miners switch to the cash fork and make it the longest chain there is technically no good reason not to just call it Bitcoin.

Hehe - I see the formatting is in place. Happy to help! :)
"I think layer 2 would be good to drop. I don't think it is needed, but it is *one* way of building this crypto currency. That said; I don't really fear it as much as you or others seem to do.

"But ""core"" is creating backwards-compatible tech that increases onchain capacity all the time! Segwit is a blocksize bump, no 2 ways about it (Antpool recently mined a 1.5mb block). MAST will allow scripts to be encoded far more efficiently and Schnorr sigs will allow for more efficient encoding of signatures (the blocks don't get bigger but the TXes get smaller, increasing TX capacity).

And I want safe tech that increases blocksize, not unsafe hardforks that barely even deliver a blocksize increase at all (BCH is better than B2X in that sense, except that it doesn't do Segwit, which is very important for offchain scaling because of the malleability thing)."
"I think 2x will just postpone it more (the problem with Core's ""solution"" to show to masses).. but even if 2x didn't happen... how many years are people willing to hold their coins before they intend to use it, which would kind of hint at what timeline we are looking at by the time the problem to start showing... few years at east? To me this is crap.. I'll go mental if I have to fight this battle that long :-("
It **will** happen. This is why they are working on Lighting network, that is the system that will do it... unless people wake up and don't get sucked into it beforehand... but this requires people to be aware of this first.
"> I don't see layer 2 combined with on chain transaction as a problem.

No the problem is when people are restricting block size to PUSH people onto layer 2. 

If there is only 2MB of transaction space and only 6 tx/s can happen on chain, but tx demand for Bitcoin is 50tx/s, where do all the other transactions HAVE to go?

In that scenario we have 6tx/s happening on chain and 44tx/s happening on the L2. That means miners only get paid for 6/50 = 12% of transactions. The other 88% are on centralized layer 2. 

THAT is the direction we are headed in with segwit. By the way segwit was never about scaling it was about restricting block space and enabling L2 systems. It had to get soft forked in because miners wouldn't support it enough for a hard fork. Hopefully now you are staring to see **why** miners would now allow this! 
"
There is no doubt that Bitcoin in its current form is unusable as a currency - especially one that is to be used frequently. Time and fees just kills any of that. So when it is time to cash out it will have to go into fiat or some well functioning crypto currency that do not have the issues we see with Bitcoin today. Users, such as us, do not have a say in this debate really. Miners, merchants and developers decide where this thing will go. Cashing out won't be an issue as long as Shapeshift or similar services exist.
"Exactly why do you need p2p censorship transaction for paying for a beer? It is inefficient by design, it just happens to cheaper for now because we are inflationary phases of Bitcoin. 

Centralized systems are much cheaper for things where you already assume trust. A huge part of scaling debate is because people misunderstood Bitcoin as free in the early days and were simply living off of inflation. Lots of people even marketed Bitcoin as free transactions in the early days and many people started businesses based on that model. But, they misunderstood Bitcoin. 

It is inefficient by design and most of the times more costly. "
Cashing out doesn't just mean converting it to fiat again, it means you wanting to spend your coins... you won't be able to use the base layer even for that... you WILL BE FORCED onto Lightning... and you will be sucked right back in into centralised system... and this WILL HAPPEN.

"> The price just shot up 10% because - just like Satoshi wanted - people are fleeing from government ineptitude in Zimbabwe.

The price just shot up because people think they're getting free money by hoarding BTC through the next two forks.  Mark my words that BTC is going to come tumbling down in price during the last week of November.   

And it will likely remain boring and uneventful until we approach the halving in 2020.   But it will be an outstanding time for people to start stocking up on cheap coins. 

I have spoken.  Let the record show.  May it be so.  And may it come to pass.

No. People are seeing the price rise and running out and buying some. Bitcoin is like a global stock right now, not the form of money it was created to be."

"Lightning isn't finished and probably never will be. As a point to point channel it works great, but that's a trivial use. It seems to be impossible to create a network that can send payments from anywhere to anywhere out of it without a transaction routing backbone.

It's been 18 months away for years. It will probably still be 18 months away in 10 years time."
What more development is needed?
"That is very clearly NOT what I said. So if all you can do is take me out of context to try to make my statement appear incorrect, your argument is very weak. 

I said that statement is against everything Bitcoin stands for. You turned that into me saying Exchanges themselves are against everything Bitcoin stands for. Nice try. "
I already gave that credit when I said Bitcoin had the first mover advantage, and when I said BCH was BTC without the sabotage.
Transaction malleability and a higher barrier to entry (whether or not those are problems is subjective)
I don't know if it will create problems. Even if it doesn't, it just isn't a real solution by itself. I can relate to developers that prefer long-term vision and find solutions that will work years to come.
Your assessment is correct - I don't hold any Bitcoin Cash. But segwit is optional. You do not need to use it if you do not want to use it, and then you do not need to use Lightning either. The scenario you presented is not based on reality the way it is in front of us right now. You might be right in that I won't ever get out of a centralised banking system, but it is not due to the reasons you posted here.
0-conf doesn't rely on trust, it relies on the vanishing small probability that a transaction doesn't go through as observed. The amount of money and effort required to break 0-conf means that the risk associated with accepting them is negligible for low value transactions. Payment processors accept that risk to deliver a better user experience, and it paid off handsomely for them up until it protocol changes made it impossible.
"Gtfo with this equivocation of the idea of ""trustless."" Bitcoin was never meant to be, and could never be, 100% ""trustless."" The trust that is required for Bitcoin is in people to act in their own best interest. It is ""trustless"" in the sense that you don't have to trust other people to be altruistic or to take care of you without there being anything in it for them. It is *not* 100% trustless."
"Well,  

1. 0-conf is way faster than CCs

2. 0-conf requires a vanishingly small amount of trust whereas with CCs you are actually giving the merchant *authority* to deduct funds from your account, hence the high number of scams. 

3. 0-conf enables the merchant to deliver an unparalleled user experience. 

4. 0-conf enables a cryptocurrency to outperform even layer 2 solutions such as the lightening network as transactions are faster, are of unlimited size, require no bond to establish a channel, and doesn't need a separate system to handle large transactions, 
"
"> it just happens to cheaper for now because we are inflationary phases of Bitcoin.

If Bitcoin is successful fees will not need to be high due to the amount of transactions that share the burden of paying for security. Consider the following:

As long as Bitcoin price doubles every four years, no fees are required. That is the inflationary part, yes? If we instead assume price will stay the same (which it of course probably will not), and next halving will reduce block reward by 6.25 BTC around summer of 2020, then if we require 6.25 BTC in transaction fees to cover for that and want 2 cent transactions we need to be able to handle 1875000 transactions and around 894 MB blocks. This sound quite a lot, but consider we might well make it past the next halving without any need for transaction costs due to the inflation canceled out by price increase. If we go two halvings that would be around 2027. That is in 10 years. Does it seem unlikely that we could handle 1GB blocks then?

None of these scenarios will play out cleanly, but the truth should be somewhere in the middle. Just some food for thought, what do you think?"
"In the future - *perhaps*. 2x will affect that perhaps. Or some other fork. Core won't be around forever.

Segwith is optional today.

I'm not sure if emotions and caps lock gets your point across in a better way though."
"Ah, thanks.

The way things are going I am not sure if cashing out into fiat will be necessary though. And I am not sure if I consider layer 2 solutions a bad idea. Anything I'm missing?"
Yeah again clearly taking me out of context. Why do you do this? Go back to the comment I am commenting on, he is not talking about exchanges. I am talking about the act of restricting block size to push people onto L2 with segwit, obviously. 
I don't count in dollars, I count in bitcoin. BCH is 0.05 bitcoin now, wake me up when it comes above 0.2 so I can dump (didn't bother to before).
">You don't really believe the majority of people are jumping into crypto to actually spend it, do you?

A tiny amount of people are spending it. Most are either holding it ""store of value"" style or jumping into speculative alts. I don't mean to come across as mean but you're deluded if you think all these customers of KYC exchanges across the western world are buying it to give a monetary voice to Zimbabweans.

Everybody can plainly see from the bloodletting of the alts (most shit, some good, all in the red) that people are just jumping on the hype-train. You're idealistic and that's admirable, but that doesn't make it true."
"SegWit is not optional. You just don't get it. Mass adoption means EVERYONE wanting to use it. Where do you think mempool and fees will be when EVERYONE wants to use the base layer? You need to stop just accepting what Core and their shills say, and think bit in future what will happen... this is what will happen... NO ONE WILL BE ABLE TO USE THE BASE LAYER BECAUSE CORE MADE IT SUPER LIMITED IN CAPACITY AND FEES WILL BE WAY TOO HIGH TO USE THE BASE LAYER!

Do you get it now?"
"Well if you don't think layer 2 solutions are a bad idea you may in fact be missing something - the importance of Proof of Work. 

I'm sure you have read the white paper but here it is again. I have read it probably 25+ times but I still find new things in there now and then. Or understand new things atleast. Sometimes it takes a while to click but when it does you will see the pure genius of the white paper design. Anyway, chapter 4 is the one about proof of work: 

https://bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf

Actually, I'll start out by saying proof of work is one of the most important (maybe THE most) parts of the system. A proof of work being performed is what makes your transaction immutable, irreversible and decentralized. Proof of work is how there is no governing authority or ""middleman"" over the transactions. Without proof of work, the system quickly degrades into a centralized one similar to Paypal, all your transactions stored on a server somewhere, no proof of work being performed. And if that's what you want, you should just use Paypal, because they allow money transfers between users for free. It doesn't get much better than free. 

What we want is a proof of work to be performed for every one of our transactions. That means every time we submit a transaction to the network, we want a miner to mine it into a block and we want the miner to get paid a small fee. This is how it works ON CHAIN. 

When we start taking transactions off chain, no proof of work is being performed, no miner is getting paid. The transaction has lost it's main qualities as decentralized and immutable as you are now at the behest of the L2 server operator or LN hub operator. They can now control you and your transaction - blacklist your address, stop you from paying someone else, reverse your payment etc (this is not LN specifically, just Layer 2 in general, since no proof of work is being performed.) So there is really a huge difference in the characteristics of the transaction, if proof of work is being performed or not. Satoshi specifically talks about this in the white paper as well, from the intro:

""Digital signatures provide part of the solution, **but the main benefit is lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double spending.""** 

So in this scenario ^ he is talking about what would happen if we removed POW from the system. We would then be trusting a third party to prevent double spending and the main benefits would be lost. 

So yes, quite literally, the main benefits are lost pushing people onto L2. The transactions become centralized, reversible, blacklist-able, you lose your decentralization, immutability and irreversibility. It looks like we will lose other beneficial qualities going onto L2 as well but these are the main distinguishing features between POW and a centralized processing system thus the most important. 

Basically what the Segwit1x/Segwit2x business model is, is a restricting of block space to push people onto L2. It's corporations trying to hijack and control a public good (block space) and prevent you from doing POW transactions so they can control your transactions on layer 2. Block space is supposed to be market based meaning there is no centrally planned limit - miners can produce blocks as big as they please and they have incentive not to make them too big.  


What sources I provide to you next depend on your answer :] 


"
His point is that restricting the block size will always create pressure to make the fees high, and will also create pressure to push people onto Layer 2. He is saying the way things are going on Bitcoin, by the time you are ready to cash out of your investment, it may not be possible or convenient to do it without the use of centralized Layer 2 systems. 
Well confusion all-around then, because exchanges are definitely centralized and do off-chain transactions. Hence why it doesn't take two hours to trade on a BTC pair.

It says it was created in seven days.
Bitcoin cash is now 5% of bitcoin’s market cap. When is the market going to start factoring in the upgrade that was implemented so the price rises?
Truth.
because any coin that isn't controlled by Bitmain is a bank product.
The joke is that Bitcoin now is the altcoin relative to the way it was intended in the whitepaper
Until enough people realize that maybe it's not the altcoin, or hashing power votes it is not.
You're an idiot as you don't get it. You are the sheeple.
Evolving any platform is healthy and keeps it relevant. Keeping original code from 2008-9 is stupid and is like my grandmother refusing to use a washing machine because she always did the cloths by her hands. 
"SegWit itself as technology doesn't. Using SegWit's extremely modest transaction rate increase as an excuse to delay simpler and far more effective transaction rate increases does. Core are using Segwit as an excuse to keep transactions throughput far below what the market needs. They are doing this in order to force transactions onto centralized systems they control, like their patented sidechains and the proposed lightning network.

Bitcoin cash on the other hand just increased the max transactions to 8X nearly effortlessly and could scale a great deal further."
its the fact that on chain capacity is restricted so that layer 2 can be built on top that makes it a bank product

The famous stalling tactics. Always pushing for delays in everything.
"Bitcoin.

It doesn't mean the comic is wrong though."
I agree with you in general. And the portion of the price tied to actual spending/transacting is certainly capped, although it could be debated whether that function would actually lead to price appreciation.  But it just seems like it has evolved into more of a wealth storage layer for the whole crypto space...like a reserve currency that really doesn't have much competition for that role due to trust established over a long period of time in addition to massive network effects.  And for such an asset to be slow moving with relatively high fees, it becomes more of a boring utility token that is used to store wealth and save in (rather than spend).  This would magnify it's deflationary aspects by slowing down it's velocity and I would argue that this would benefit the price much more than large scale spending of it would.  I'm not saying that this is what Core is even trying to do but I'm just looking at the situation objectively because ideology is bad for the finances.
"The Bitcoin all-time-highs are tainted by segwit core's censorship and deceit. 

The Bitcoin Cash value is honest, open and achieved in just 81 days."
HAHAHA
Bible doesn't say earth is flat...
Isn't BCC a better Bitcoin though? Faster transaction confirmations, lower fees, higher throughput. BCC is pretty much ready for use as a Visa replacement today. It just doesn't have the brand name and publicity that Bitcoin has so Bitcoin is getting all the new money.

The price was not in the whitepaper though. It is more about how Bitcoin should work and what it can be used for. Electronic cash and all that sheeet.
"Sweetheart? We are better than this. We are not enemies.

BTC is without doubt the dominant coin and I don't support Bitcoin Cash, but it is *very* clear that the 8-9 year old white paper describes BCH and not BTC."
It's at $6000 because of the upcoming fork. People are getting in for a chance to make money on the incoming value resulting from the 2x fork, just like what happened with BCH recently. The memory of major profits are fresh in everyone's mind. It also means alt coins are on sale. I'm guessing many people are going to jump back out of the Bitcoins into the alts, to ride the waves back and forth. Price, unfortunately, has absolutely nothing to do with people's values or the technology.
Boom

"It is better *for me* because it gives me a better ROI.

If Bitcoin Cash is better for you then that is great. We can both have our cake and eat it too. Except you can't have the name even though the coin you prefer is closer to Satoshis vision than the most valuable coin.

If Bitcoin Cash is able to have better growth and not have the uncertainty that an altcoin does then I'll happily move over. 

And we don't need to put words into each others mouth. Do you follow Bitcoin Cash because Roger Ver and Jihan Wu said it was better? I doubt that's the reason. I don't prefer Bitcoin due to Core saying so. I would prefer if Core dissolved to be honest.

Any talk of time-travel is just wishful thinking. Why do you believe Bitcoin Cash is better than for example Etherum, Monero or Zcash?"
"I read the news and BTC recorded its first year of negative merchant growth. Unlike investors, merchants must deal with the high fees, broken 0-conf and artificial congestion that cannot be concealed with censorship. 

Bitcoin Cash puts the merchants back in business as it is electronic cash with low fees and 0-conf instant transactions - the fastest period! (actually faster than the so-called lightening network). Finally, Bitcoin Cash is already free of btc core, something 2X is still struggling with. Not sure why it needs to ""*win over btc core*.""

Very true. I know of people getting caught up in the Bitcoin frenzy. They think they are investing in electronic cash not realizing segwit core has turned it into a settlement system. Segwit core are shamelessly trading on the reputation of the Bitcoin that *was*, not on the Bitcoin that it has *become*.
"I see where you're coming from, but I think you're missing a key feature of bitcoin in that it is infinitely divisible. Mass adoption would create massive demand, and pricing units such as mBTC or a satoshi even would become the new ""whole integers"" of bitcoin. 6 billion people / 21 million coins all using to transact freely, openly, and trustlessly, is a far higher value for 1 BTC than is it turning into a pet experiment for the banks to replace ACH with."
The market favors inertia.

Why does segwit make bitcoin a bank product?
"This is literally why my friend bought Bitcoin Cash. And I bought alongside him. (He still holds about 2 but I dumped almost all of it half the price, so some of you gotta thank me for making you richer.)

Yep. Bitcoin is the brand name in crypto. Ordinary people haven't heard of other cryptos and don't really know what the difference is. Until that changes the new money coming in will continue to go mostly to Bitcoin despite BCC being a more capable coin. Additionally bitcoin could eventually improve sometime down the road and corner the market. Having the tech and the brand name would kill a lot of altcoins.

Let me know if you need more or have any other questions.

"segwit removes the asic boost mining advantage that certain groups were abusing

those groups don't like this"
People,Blockstream really, are shilling for it because they want an excuse to avoid the real capacity increase a simple block size increase would give. They want to force transactions off the blockchain onto networks they control. Networks they have patents for. They want the transaction fees that should be paid to the miners for themselves.
Lol
"Ok, I’m sorry but did you seriously just say “I don’t understand Segwit” and “people are shilling for Segwit” in the same comment?

I think BCH has the better scaling strategy, so no I’m not “shilling”, but come on. Learn the technology before you criticize the people who support it. That’s the intellectual equivalent of sitting on the couch in your boxers all day."
"> Centralized off chain transactions are fine

wow. "
"thanks, have you got sources to researches to your claims?

Huh, I'd never heard of MimbleWimble before, intresting stuff. From the little reading I've done (I intend to do more) it looks like the prerequisites would be the LN on Bitcoin and another crypto/sidechain (Possibly Grin when it's ready?) to allow Atomic Swaps between the two right? I've not seen a lot of optimism about it getting onto the main chain.
"Wait, how does adding an optional new tx format magically turn bitcoin into a ""bank product""?

I'm quite certain that you don't know what segwit actually is. "
"> Are you aware of how segwit enabled sidechains would allow a shift to MimbleWimble?

There is no way a real human being said that without being paid to.

We don't want a towering Heath Robinson (edit: Rube Goldberg in 'Murican) contraption of precariously balanced, ridiculously named components. Fact of the matter is that all of that was invented in response to an artificial problem, and the only reason Segwitcoin still exists is it's leeching off the original Bitcoin's first mover advantage. Without that it would be worth a bucket of lukewarm diarrhea no matter how many NimbleBimbles you bolt to it.

BCH is 8 weeks old. It's doing better than BTC was at 8 weeks."
"Yes it is complete shit.

Because it's inherently client/server. There appears to be no way to route transactions that doesn't involve some kind of central router.
Man the votes on this comment are so out of proportion. Hmmmm.
Nice hindsight 
"I view it as a potential ~70% that will act as a release valve for too high fees or throughput demand. 

The reason I think it's meaningful is that it's the first time since the 1MB cap we've seen an actual increase. You might think it way too little and way too late, I'm just excited to see the complete stalemate end, even if it doesn't decrease fees by an order of magnitude from day one.

Happy cake day btw (:"
"Ethereum followed Vitalik.

If Bitcoin is following guys like Greg Maxwell, then I'm even more bullish for BCC."

It's IPTBIHTGI.
Yeah... and when they recognize that Bitcoin is here to stay they will buy BCH so they can you know... use it to pay for stuff.
"Bitcoin price is $328, it’s shitcoin segwitblockstreamcoin hits $6000.

Edit: ask Ver.

Edit 2: If you don’t believe me or don’t get it, I don’t have time to try to convince you, sorry."

"Let's see how far the use case of ""print coins nobody transacts"" can go."
A three percent increase in tx capacity is what you're calling meaningful?
"Try this one, make sure you are viewing the all-time chart. https://blockchain.info/charts/n-transactions

Number of bitcoin transactions per day began declining for the first time in bitcoin's history, once the blocks became full."
"Learned that 3 years ago.

Took 2 years for the price to recover.

"You're referring to when it rose from $100 to $1200 and then ""crashed"" to $400 and stayed there for months... sooooo a 300% increase in value that it stabilized at.

Ah yes, so much regret then."
"It’s called tuition. Everyone pays it. Some the easy way. Some the hard.

You gotta go through it once to learn. The honey badger of money is called so for a reason. We ride together folks."
Spending half your posts whining about being downvoted is probably why you are being downvoted. Change the record.
If you say so.
he was already flirting with jumping on b2x (despite being anti-segwit?), he has no loyalty to any coin and has done nothing but confuse noobs who look at bitcoin.com and think it is a legit source of information
Ver promotes that? https://medium.com/@freetrade68/announcing-bcash-8b938329eaeb
Late 2018
Big mistake. Buy your BTC back while it's still cheap. Otherwise, you'll regret it for the rest of your life.
"ICOs are a complete scam. Avoid at all cost.

Bitcoin is boss. Trade shitcoins at your own risk."
"Good stuff - scrolling through this thread, I've read at least 10 replies claiming it's full of bitter BCH holders, and not a single actual bitter post.

r/btc generally demonstrates more class.

Besides, most people hold both. Any market share gain by one strain is just more dry powder for anyone that believes theres a chance of at least a moderate flip happening down the line.

"
Pretending that Bcash isn't a far superior name for a coin that is decidedly NOT Bitcoin --just so that you can confuse newcomers to crypto-- is the childish move. Bcash is failing. Jump ship while you can.
"Childish, eh? [""GOT is perfect you shut your whore mouth""](https://np.reddit.com/r/Sense8/comments/69d87u/sense8_episode_discussion_s02e06_isolated_above/dhda494/?context=3)"
That's how people lose their shirts. We will lose up to 80% easily.
"Do you also post this when people say "" bitcore ""? If not, why not? "
an altcoin promoted by Roger Ver as Bitcoin.
Please link to that video so that I can occasionally look to it and laugh
"Dogecoin was #3 for a long time, and got there at the same speed BCH did, without the help of being a split-off from Bitcoin.

BCH will fall away just like they did. (though for the record, I still love their community)"
How you know you're witnessing a bubble: when people literally start speaking as though the price will never go down again.
Ya.  Hopefully most of those people were just posturing.
[deleted]
Or maybe they'll recognize that forking off from Bitcoin is not a winning strategy and Bitcoin is here to stay for that reason among others... so they'll dump BCH for BTC?
Not 325 and #4 market cap in 1.5 mo 
LOL... okay.  I'll get in on this one too.
"Don’t worry, we have CSW, Ver and newly raising starscam Ayre and they will pump! Also our community invested by shorting BCash, so lower price higher profit.
