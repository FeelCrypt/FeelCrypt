"> Edit: protesting against nazis vs protesting against freedom of speech (NFL) any different? 

That's a decent one. I would wager that some would say that freedom of speech does not extend to the workplace. The athletes are welcome to protest Trump during their offtime, but the law should not restrict employers from firing people for protesting on company time."

They could, but then all the other miners would either reject it, or effectively increase the blocksize. We don't care what size blocks miners mine, just what size blocks they will accept. Win/Win
You could create code today that does not accept tips that exceed a certain amount. For example you could create code that says 'if the tips from a btc transactions exceed 10 bitcoins, then keep 10 bitcoins of it and send the remainder as a tip to the next miner'. This could be tested on the testnet and reused next time we need to increase the blocksize.

"Very helpful illustration.  

With all the stockpiling going on, even with the potential fork 2 weeks away, I plan to wait a bit longer and convert some BTC to BCC.

Free extra coins?, how so?
Exactly. I don't see both chains surviving long enough to cash out on the other. Either the miners do what they are signaling and S1X drops to 5% hash power and never gets another block, or the miners decide the S1X chain is more valuable and back out of the fork and the S2X chain never gets blocks.

High prices for Bitcoin is generally a good thing for crypto so it's worth celebrating a bit (even if due to a brutal, oligarch dictator?). However, I find it hard to really cheer about a broken monetary system. When we finally get a distributed monetary system that we can *use* widely, will be the time to really celebrate.

how is it decentralized?
Gigabyte blocks would require at least 1.7mb/s to keep up, but a faster speed is desirable seeing that the entire block history must be downloaded when you first set up your node.
It's still a Gig every 10 mins, the 20-50MB assumes you have most of the tx's already (1 Gigs worth), but still in Netflix ballpark (3GB/hr for hd) which will push demand for ubiquitous high speed connections.

Somehow you guys all conflate trust in the whole sum of the network as trust in individual parties. The first is a given if you want to participate in bitcoin in any capacity, the latter is not required by bigger blocks.
Unless your mining your own transactions you are trusting in third parties.  Even if you do mine your own transactions your trusting the rest of the miners will not reject your block.
go do your homework. you don't have to trust anyone... 
Get a server then. Full nodes aren't supposed to be hosted from your home.
"Every form of money requires some degree of trust. Even gold. You trust that the market isn't being manipulated by crooked companies. If you don't buy expensive tools to detect it, you're trusting that the center isn't filled with tungsten. When trading gold, you're trusting that whatever person you're dealing with isn't going to pull out a gun and rob you.

If you buy your bitcoins through a service like Coinbase, you're trusting them. That's not a bad thing. They know they can make more money in the long run by being an honest and healthy player in the market. The entire Bitcoin market does well when players behave in a trustworthy manner."
Hi T_D vocabulary 
But you still need to receive all the data, you just do it over the span between two blocks
"An SPV wallet asks a third party for proof of payment and then verifies that proof.  The proof of payment first consists of the headers of all the blocks in the blockchain (40MB or so but its the same for every proof).  Second, we need to trace from the block header to the transaction.  Since each block contains a tree of transactions, the proof contains all data in the path from the root to your payment.  So the size of this is log2(number of tx in the block).  (read about ""Merkle trees"".  IDK how technical you are so I'll just say that log2(something) is not much data.  For example 4 billion tx would give you 32 pieces of data."

"> minors

miners"
Nodes will have already seen many of the tx before the block is mined. Only those tx which it doesn't yet have are transferred.
that's the point, he doesn't know. but if you throw around some words and make it look like you know wtf you're talking about then you can calm it a day. 
Validity of blocks according to the protocol rules? Isn't that obvious? Nothing stops miners from colluding to make fake transactions besides other validating nodes.
"Cool.  But using Bitcoin does not mean you **have** to run a full node.  If you want the privacy/history, then you will be able to justify the associated expenses.

The vast majority of the people only need the security of SPV.

Have fun trying to do in-person transactions carrying a server in your backpack."
[deleted]
Each node will still have to have received the 1GB of transactions. Traditionally, they would then receive all these transactions again in the block that is issued. With Xthin, the nodes get a list of transactions and construct the block themselves. So you only download the transactions once, as they happen, rather than twice when a block is issued. 
I'm confused by your comment. x thin is transferring the block by transaction id's so we don't have to send everything else associated with the transaction. What do you mean by not right at the moment of block propagation? 
You too. Have an up vote.
"> Nothing stops miners from colluding

Yes, economic incentives. "
If that's so, would you care to defend their reasoning to oppose any blocksize increase? That any small increase would make it centralized...?
Lmao. Can't believe you would even think about saying this when core's main goal is restricting on chain capacity to push people onto L2. 
Heil Core!
Except you can't communicate with most other email users because their email providers will filter your messages as spam before it even reaches them.
"Yeah, no

Take a simple increase in the block size from 1MB for instance

You are labouring under the misapprehension that core wants bitcoin to succeed, or that everyoneâ€™s opinions carry equal weight. They have dispelled these myths years ago. You clearly werenâ€™t paying attention. "
In Core's world, nothing is clearly better in every way unless they invented it.
No matter how many eyes there is on Core there is only a few that has commit access and these people want a fully congested network to artificially raise the  fees because they have awkward understanding of economics.  
xthin get's, in the real world, 97 to 97.5% compression...compact blocks?  nobody actually knows since no data has ever been presented other than theoretical.
"Both of those technologies makes it possible to scale much more directly on-chain without miners suffering noticeably for it. They've already actually tested 100 tps assuming decent internet connectivity with no problems. They're also planning on testing with at least one node in Beijing (inside the Chinese firewall) to see what an actual experiment can teach us and not just hypotheses and political ""truths"". Aka ""science""."
You are not asking other parties for verification.  You are asking them for a concise proof of transaction inclusion that you then verify yourself.  The trust part of an SPV client is only that that network-as-a-whole hasn't chosen to allow someone else to steal coins unrelated to your wallet, or mint more coins than allowed today.  These ARE important things to be validated as-a-whole but not by every person on this planet.
"You trust the aggregate hashpower as verification, you don't trust another party.  Do you know how SPV works?  When you say ""asking other parties for verification"" could you explain that.  Like technically what exactly do you think is happening at that point for the SPV wallet?"

"if miners collectively change the rules you either follow or are left on a stuck chain...

as for less secure how?

less private? as in someone is going to match your ip to your address? tor should help, I think for most people this is a ~~mute~~ moot point. if you really need that much privacy then you must have enough money that it justifies buying a nicer machine. and no not talking about a 20000$ one.  "
This is an assumption of the whitepaper.  The word honest appears LOTS of times in the whitepaper.
"FYI that is our baseline results with BU essentially ""as is.""  A few days ago we achieved 300 tx/sec sustained thanks to /u/thezerg1's work streamlining mempool admission.  I think we'll hit ~1,000 tx/sec sustained on the next ramp we attempt.  Mempool admission is no longer the bottleneck, as we've demonstrated mempool admisson rates over 10,000 tx/sec already."
same efficiency ? so what are people excited about ?
"Hey /u/nullc, can you people also replicate this test so that we can compare your results? It seems that currently 100 tps on decent node hardware and internet connectivity is not a problem at least with the Bitcoin Unlimited software. How does your Bitcoin Core software perform?

Uh and why not? Hosting a node on a single IP is perfect. Hosting 2 nodes on the same IP is already useless as you do nothing for decentralization. Now think how useless it is to host multiple nodes in the same datacenter or cloud.

BIP152's careful design also avoids a trivial collision attack that can be deployed against xthin to slow the propagation of blocks.
BIP152 also has a complete and detailed specification and was the first of these proposals deployed in production on more than a small number of nodes, and the first to have multiple inter-operable implementations. BU likes to trumpet that they were first to release-- but this is because they deployed an unspecified and largely dysfunctional test version and marketed the hell out of it rather than working on engineering to make it better."
Whether the RasPi can handle it or not is irrelevant... The fact is you do not NEED to run your own wallet to secure your transactions. Granted, running your own node is a way to continually audit the honesty of miners, whether it'd be live or with a couple blocks of delay (which is fine, as there will always be up-to-date larger nodes to pull the alarm lever should something fishy occur)

maybe 1MB is the reason why bitcoin is at 5800 today, and when they increased it to 8M, the thing dropped 10% in the last 24hr. Yea, market speaks, people care of decentralization than coffee transactions.

I know what SPV is. I'm wondering if you can concisely explain why asking other parties for verification is not trust.
Actually, you do have to trust that miners don't suddenly collectively change the rules, if you are using a lightweight client. It is also generally less secure and you have less privacy
No you just need to filter through gigabytes of spam emails that you get inbetween the real ones. There is a reason most people use Gmail or an alternative.

I really don't understand this initial sync argument. It took you three days to join the global financial network. Um .. ok, and? A month? Um .. ok, and? 
"Every day users were never meant to operate full nodes. The main Bitcoin client is not for normal users, it is a server application for miners and businesses. 

Satoshi had noted himself long ago that he assumed full nodes would be the domain of  datacenters, to which even 1gb every 10 minutes is trivial already *today*, and are typically served buy large scale backhauls that make your home bandwidth look like nothing.

What we are thinking is that Bitcoin can scale on-chain just fine, and this test is further proof that is the case without. They used full 1gb blocks to do this, that doesn't mean real block sizes will be anywhere near that for many years in reality.



"
It's not so crazy if you have gig fiber. 10 gig fiber is on its way now too.

So he confirmed that Cores code works as designed? What a surprise
There's no real need to download the entire blockchain for a node. The extra security it gives is insignificant. The current protocol does not allow it but in the future it would probably be enough to get only the last hundred blocks or so from a hundred different other nodes, validate them to check that it works out and you would in practice be as secure as someone who have downloaded and validated the entire blockchain. This idea that the entire transaction history must be saved in eternity is actually rather silly.

Cool! I can't wait for Internet to advance to the point we can node that sumbitch up.
What on earth are you people thinking? I set up a full node a few days ago, and it took THREE days to download the bloody blockchain. And that's just with 1 MB blocks. I guess 2MB blocks maybe won't be a big problem in the short run, but 1 GB would just be insane. No normal person is going up be able to participate in such a network. 
Increasing a variable, an absolute madman

You are still trusting people to not point their hashrate elsewhere. You still need to trust people just because the system is set up to incentivize honesty doesn't mean people always play honestly

I think the fact that they're doing A THOUSAND TIMES more capacity than Core leaves PLENTY of headroom for decentralization.  Blocks in the real world aren't going to 1 gig overnight.  By then, terabyte blocks will be under testing.
Translation: Herp derp derp herp, my Blockstream dev lords told me something, so I repeat it and don't feel dum dum anymore, herp derpp
Technology will catch up to make it possible by the time we start needing it. 
A global network may sound big, but there is barely more than a single hop between the actual nodes of the network (mining nodes).
You'd need to trust specific companies if you need to open channels between payer and receiver. If all you need is a miner to include your transactions, it can be anyone, and you don't need to know it previously. 
Seems unnecessarily specific, like when Data times things to the second.

"No normal person has to run nodes.

Light wallets are the present and the future."
"No normal person participates in mining on a large scale. In other words, normal people already do not have the economic means to participate in securing the network. Nodes have almost zero cost to run. There is a reason they don't have a 'vote' in Bitcoin.

Also, this argument is getting old. You don't need to sync the entire blockchain to get a current view of the value in the Bitcoin network. It's only necessary because scalability has been focused on Segwit2x instead of incremental changes to Bitcoin."
ahhaha good luck verifying and propagating 1GB blocks across a global network in a timely manner without sacrificing decentralisation.

He's of the opinion, or so it seems, that his node decides what Bitcoin is. Only his node.

We are not going from 1MB to 1GB tomorrow.  The purpose of going so high is to prove that it can be done -- no 2nd layer is necessary.  By the time we get blocks even over 10MB we'll have technologies like utxo commitments and partial syncing clients (imagine a node that behaves as a SPV client upon startup, but is transitioning to a full node in the background) which will make your UX much better.

Heil Core!
will be in the next release...we just merged it yesteday...BTW our IBD should be about 20% faster now than Core's...we have not only Core's improvements to the dbcache but additional ones as well.  Mostly you'll notice if you have a restricted dbcache size...so more marginal nodes will benefit from our additional enhancements.  Basically we don't flush away all the useful outputs during the IBD process the way Core still does.  We save them and then trim the cache as needed.  I'll also be working on another enhancement which comes out of research /u/thezerg1 did a while ago about the probabilities surrounding which coins will likely be mined.  More to come...

Way to make these 1 MB block pussies look even dumber.

For a proper test, you'll also need to simulate a stream of 1GB blocks, 1 every 10 minutes, and measure all the timings appropriately. 
Hi Andrew, if an attacker change part of the tx stored on a node, and this node (or multiple node) form their block woth this rogue transaction instead of the original one how the network will react?
Wow amazing! Thank you for all your hard work!
"Yup, so Xthin is at most a 2x reduction in _total_ bandwidth used, which doesn't sound too fancy; but its main advantage is massive, couple-orders-of-magnitudes reduction in _burst_ bandwidth required to ensure the network doesn't fall apart. Makes it easier to set up mining nodes with big blocks, and eases centralization pressure on the network latency side of things."
Yes. But before xthin, nodes would see most transactions twice. Once when they are broadcast to the world, and once when they are included in a block. So it does cut down on bandwidth usage, spreading it over the time between blocks, as you said.
On track with the roadmap, good job.

"> With Xthin, it takes 20 - 50 MB to propagate a 1 GB block

This is deceptive.  It takes >1GB to propagate a 1GB block there-- but most of the data is sent in advance.

With compact blocks it takes less than half the amount of data as xthin at the time of transmission for that size..."
Have fun with your 1M blocks.
"Let's have blocks big enough that only a handful of miners in China can possibly ever validate.
