ITT, butthurt bcashers, nothing more. 
"So, why couldn't he promote LTC, even though he sold it all? Such a dumb attitude. It's not all about pumping the coin you hold. üôÑ

Btw, even if he has no LTC, the benefits from LTC becoming successful, because the success of LTC will always be tied to his name and it elevates his reputation, thus he gets more respect and business elsewhere in the ecosystem."
"Ltc and bch are great


The tribalists are shit"
"Fair point idk anything about the lightning swap thing. But without it (without what I think is lightning swap) it would be just as easy to sell btc for the great doge and then send that. 

But regardless I can see what u mean. But to hold ltc long term I guess I don‚Äôt see the point in that"
Isn't laughing enough? Lolololololol
Such odd behavior.

I try to keep my trolling light hearted and slightly funny or weird.
They both certainly could be. I have a problem with the management of one of them though which I think hurts one over the other. 
Ltc‚Äôs advantage is its age and proven track record. Not many coins have as much up time as ltc.
Apparently you still don't understand..
Calm down, cowboy.
This has been this way since its inception, you can't just blame it on this fork thing.

"> multireddits

I know, but that does not change the amount of information in those reddits, just how you display it."
How can anybody blame him?  He sold very near the top and could buy back multiple times what he had, plus enough land and precious metals that the Lee clan will be set for generations.  I‚Äôm sure most of us here wish we could have had the foresight to do the same.
"Fair enough. This sub has its ups and downs. Right now we're picking up the pieces from being attacked by a rouge actor and a bloody fork. Things take time, we only just got some of the tipping bots back online, for example.

And to be fair the whole of crypto is a bloody mess not just bch, compile that with the untimely fork, and trolls/shills trying to further smear BCH while it's weak, it's easy to see why we are here.

But it's temporary, I'm not swayed or fearful in the slightest. BCH still has some of the greatest potential compared to most crypto. The streets are bloody, and I'm buying."
Yea...umm...not sure what your issue is.  Have fun keeping up with your 3 subreddits.  Learn about multireddits, maybe it will be useful for you.  
"well, either you do not follow 

>*all* cryptocurrency related subs

or you ""follow"" them extremely superficially

or you spend hours a day doing it.

which is it?

I am not a psychic, but following that many subs is just not practical, if you have a job, or really, do anything else thoughout the day."
Did you choke on it yet?
">So you're arguing about what ""following"" means, now? Holy shit.

sure, why not. 

I read some amount of 3 of them + a tiny bit of some others and I take quite a bit of time.

But I am sure you ""follow"" the 100+ reddits related to cryptocurrency, and learn a lot about them  because you are interested in the tech."
not per se but spokesmen or drivers or whatever title would best fit. 
üçÜ?
"LOL imagine being so butthurt that you argue about a stranger's crypto multisub browsing/research habits.  So you're arguing about what ""following"" means, now?  Holy shit.  I'll have you know that the amount of time I spend depends on my day.  If I knew you, or if you weren't so hostile maybe you'd get to know how practical that is for my lifestyle :)."
Meanwhile Litecoin flippens both bcashs. 
There are no managers
Ltc still has a higher market cap.
Classic bitcoin cash tactic. How do you feel about that flappening happening?
Huh. And here I was thinking you were trolling. 
+1 saved me a post
If only you knew how much I've made LOL.  Probably multiples more than you've seen in your whole life.
"We all saw it.  

Charlie fucked his loyal litcoiners by telling them to hodl"
I would like to see LTC porn.
He was corrected (Charlie lee) with his 2 prediction year ago, must give him a ‚Äúlike‚Äù üòÅ
"lmao
"
Bch came after ltc and both are a first gen tech. Calling ltc pointless is hypocritical.
"It is so lame


Both ltc and bch need to prove they are better than btc


Yet its core extremist users attack each other

Lame as fuck

Tribalist as fuck

Compete and win


Words are shit"
Is that a yes?
[Ah, the old Reddit fap-a-roo.](https://np.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/a6bema/the_baker_overheard_our_daughter_picking_out_her/ebtti75/?context=3)
the chickun is all cluck
Shower thought: Roger Ver and CSW just sold everything as well üòÅ
Charlie Lee:  the biggest scammer in all of crypto.  Also, Adam Back's cuckold.  
Does the flappening count as porn?
LOL
hmmm.. 
Porn has done as much damage to society as fiat currency and fractional reserve banking. Stop watching it and stop promoting it. 
Yep, the timing of this post is just fucking hilarious.
I'm fapping the flapping, thats for sure!
Well, in the meantime, we're down to the price Charlie predicted for Litecoin to drop
It looks like Ltc is competing and about to win.  More accurately, Ltc is just doing what it has always been doing (long before Bch even existed)- being the transactional crypto for the real world. 
He was honest to say he gonna to cash out, I wonder how much the leaders of both bch sold their coins to make the market cap even less than LTC‚Äôs. But people just hate the honest guy like Charlie and believe in a fool like Ver.
It's by design.  The trolls and fud have been turned to just highlight the negativity.
Speaking of which the flippening has happened. Litecoin now has more market cap than Bitcoin Cash!
I love my ltc, when bitcoin cost $50 to send $5, i could sent ltc for pennies
Not a good day to bring it up though.
