"u/goxedbux this time it will be bigger with the potential to have a bigger negative impact than Gox. 

I'm posting here because my comments are censored and the negative impact of of a limited block size is banned from r/bitcoin.

the impact from a limited block size and increasing transaction congestion will ensure transactions are stuck for all exchanges with a market crashes up or down. 

Lots of investors will be burned by transaction delays while fees for processing transaction increase there won't be enough space to process the backlog until after the crash.  

BS/Core are forcing people to keep coins on exchange, and penalizing those who move coins onto privately managed keys. 

There will be no winners during the next crash just losses on both sides."
