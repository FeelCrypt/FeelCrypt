:-D
That didn’t last long...
Then please resume working on it :)
Yes. Spread the word, free the world
Nope. Hard forks != currency splits. Years of Blockstream lies and propaganda have made people think this, but most cryptos regularly upgrade through hard forks. 
There's no indication it will split. As a user you need an up to date wallet. Even SPV wallets need to update to this because it changes the rules for block headers as well.
Coins will only split in the rare occasion some people mine the old chain for some strange reason. But this won't happen 
Not a problem with 0-conf
It's worth noting that Bitcoin is currently about as inflationary as the US dollar and has been higher so that is not something that has been driving price increases or holding.
"Just purchase and buy back to top up periodically. 

Deflation causes people to spend *more*, not less. At max deflation in bitcoin people are posting the lambos they bought left and right. Newly rich people spend more than anyone. 

The reason all fiat is inflationary is that it allows governments to stealthily tax their citizens. The spending argument is just the justification. "
the current price is totally BCH'n
"These arguments are so common I came up with a form to respond to them.

    Your argument that big blocks can't work is based on the following belief(s):
    
    (X) Storage of big blocks is impossible
    ( ) Validating big blocks is impossible
    ( ) Networks can't transfer big blocks
    ( ) Bigger blocks cause centralization
    
    Your argument is flawed because:
    
    (X) Disk is cheap and easily available
    ( ) CPU power is cheap and easily available
    ( ) Network bandwidth is cheap and easily available
    ( ) Miners only need a block header, they don't need to sync the entire blockchain to each miner
    ( ) Node count proves nothing
    
    Furthermore:
    
    ( ) Not all users need to run a full node
    (X) Not all nodes need to store the entire blockchain
    ( ) The belief that transaction fees must cost a significant proportion of a full node is flawed
    ( ) The belief that Blocksteam or the bitcoin core group has the best programmers is flawed
    (X) There is no reason to believe that bigger blocks cause centralization
    ( ) Using 'avoiding centralization' as a reason whilst supporting a fully centralized development team is flawed
    ( ) It's your job to prove your arguments, see Russell's teapot

quite confusing. Thanks for the link.
"At the time, it wasn't such a bad decision.  It's only possible to critique that decision with hindsight bias.

Gavin is an upstanding individual."
"> He did kinda hand them the keys to the kingdom...

Yeah, but.  Hey, he's just another human being, don't ask him to get on the cross for Bitcoin.

If he had tried to retain control the attacks never would have let up against him.  He has a right to just be a guy who helps the project as he as able."
Details on what exactly happened then? I've heard from some that Wladimir essentially manipulated Gavin.
60% if you want to send $10
They're all BCH node clients. This way the dev team's not centralized. Same thing with the communication channels. BCH reduces the points of attack. For example, there isn't one person who controls three major info sites/forums and, if turned by a gov't/banking org can sabotage the entire economic space.
Yup storage is cheap and easy
How many of those are alt-forks and how many are alt-coins? I hate the inflation from alt-forking.
What is the fee % to spend? 
"He did kinda hand them the keys to the kingdom...

I think I understand *why* he did it (he didn't want to be seen as 'in charge' of bitcoin), but looking back I think it's pretty clear that he made a mistake in trusting Wladmir as the maintainer."

I’m not saying it’s a good thing, I’m wondering how it will all play out and I’m just excited to see where bitcoin goes. Basically what I am saying is still today the best way to use bitcoin is to buy as much as you possible can and just hold it. Use fiat or other coins for trade since the return on holding far outweighs any advantage you could get from trading(for the average user). And does that hurt it’s use case as a currency? Maybe not, I’m sure there’s a lot I’m missing and hopefully it will all be figured out in time. 
"Bcash is the term for the altcoin created as a fork of bitcoin. Official subreddit: r/bcash 
"
"it’s about transferring of blocks, not about storage ;-)"
Keep in mind that Gavin never wanted to lead Bitcoin in the first place, and that's why he handed over the reins prematurely to someone who turned out to be disastrous for the project. That happened because Gavin was not interested in a sole leadership position. Some people — often very brilliant people — do not covet leadership positions, and I think we should allow them to make their own decisions in that regard. Just my opinion though. I'd obviously be happy if Gavin decided to head up a Bitcoin Cash development team.
"I think its probably best to let the currency's performance be the ""face"".  While I think Gavin is the greatest, backing individual personalities is probably what got Bitcoin into the mess its in now.
"

Will do. 
Forgive my stupid question. What's the difference here between these forks and the coin splitting forks?
So I don't have to worry with the bitcoin.com iOS wallet?
No just purchase with currency that gets worse over time :fiat and save with the currency that gets better over time:bitcoin. It’s basic math.

The current blockchain structure, on disk, is uncompressed and unorganized. By enabling LZ4 compression you can save ~18% naively. If *real* work was done for storing the chain more efficiently we could cut the effective size in half.
"Really the only thing that has to happen is someone has to figure out how to compress the block size for the transfer too. 

I wonder how quantum will impact all this. "
Who the fuck is going to add 2TB a day in the next 5 years...Fucking idiot. 
Ah, that's cool that there's still potential on that side as well :-) That will definitely help!
":-) if blocks can be compressed on the go you dont need 50g blocks to start with as they could be compressed directly ;-)"
"Your mate suggested 50 GB blocks, which are about 300 GB per hour which is 7.2 TB per day. The ""If you had"" suggests a hypothetical scenario then. Your insults seem to suggest you are not old enough to understand hypotheticals yet, but don't worry, you'll grow older and understand some day <3"
Would a city wide fiber optic network be able to handle a Bitcoin network at 50GB blocks?
Like i said, 2TB per day wont be added within the next 5 years. Learn to read, dumbass.
LOL! I AM NOT A ROBOT. I AM TOTALLY HUMAN. HA! HA!
2 devs? I think you mean at least 3 dev *teams*. Off the top of my head there's BitcoinABC, Bitcoin Unlimited, and BitcoinXT. There's also a variety of miners. Or just buy an ASIC from the multiple companies that make them. Bitfury, for example. Sure, /r/bitcoin loves (inadvertantly) advertising Bitmain ASICs but there are others out there.
What is it with all these sockpuppets?

These should be a thing. Most small blocker arguments warrant form responses because they don't realize (thanks to the censorship) how old and facile their talking points are.

"storage is what limits 8mb/10min to 25tx/sec
faster block propagation wont help with that limit."
Nah, I disagree, because first of all, I like what he's doing now and I think he should keep doing it. Pure research is key. Secondly, I'm a strong believer that the maximum societal efficiency is achieved when humans are permitted to self-organise, and to choose what are the best roles for themselves without outside pressure, instead of having a role thrust upon them — for much the same reason that the market achieves maximum efficiency when merchants are allowed to set prices however they wish, and people are allowed to spend money however they choose, or even not spend it at all.
I agree with that. Sorry for the bad joke.
No, it was a bad decision. Understandable but bad.
"So much has happened that it's tough to summarize, but here's a start:

3.5 years ago Gavin stepped down as lead maintainer: https://archive.is/hqJRk

1.5 years after that, Mike Hearn wrote a good article summarizing the Blockstream takeover: https://medium.com/@octskyward/on-block-sizes-e047bc9f830."
A fork only results in a split if you have a large portion of the community committed to keeping one side or the other alive. Usually people are on the same page with upgrades, so the currency doesn't split into two. 
Splits only happen if there is no consensus about whether or not to take the fork.
No, it's based on Bitpay's Copay wallet. Perfectly secure.
"It's always the same three arguments. CPU is impossible, DISK is impossible, NETWORKING is impossible. You argue against what they say and they flip to another.

I got the idea from the form that was used on slashdot to answer half-brained spam solutions.
"
I think the key takeaway is that bch is a linear solution to an exponential problem. 8mb won't hold someday and you'll HF again. Big blocks on their own are not an efficient solution to an exponential problem. Something that people for big blocks are more or less avoiding 
"You know, I would kinda like to see that actually. Just not with Bitcoin of course.

Full nodes, mining nodes even, on every phone. Battery life and data caps be damned."
Your view of BTC must be even more harsh then. Centralized control with no use other than hodling forever (because it's to expensive to move or even spend).
"Doesn’t matter, because the world is not centered around a fiber optics connected city. If you want centralization, no need for Bitcoin :-)

Anyway, I think we derailed this topic a bit. Just saying that while the update is a very cool new piece of tech that it wont help increasing tx throughput beyond 25/s"
"It kind-of doesn't. It's a good and useful step if it does what it claims though and that argument was bunk even when it was bouncing around between Greg's grey cells before making it's way to his typing fingers.

Downvotes? Look, the block transmission is hugely cut but transactions still have to be sent and the Bitcoin gossip protocol is inefficient so the savings will be less than 50% of the bandwidth in the best of conditions and actually much less. If you don't agree, dispute it. This is still a worthwhile optimization. But as stated, the bandwidth argument is bogus anyway, we have plenty to spare."
I'm all for innovation via alt-coins. I'm doing this myself by working on a bunch of privacy layers around smart contracts. However there is a fundamental difference between an alt coin and an alt fork, where the number of limited coins is immediately doubled. Alt-forks should be attacked with dump sales on exchanges, followed by a 51% attack that forges emptying the exchange wallets holding the altfork. Alt-forks are immoral and wrong. If you want to innovate, please do. Don't invent a few billion dollars and create a PR campaign specifically designed to legitimize your theft of hashrate combined with massive inflation of a limited resource.

After the end of SegWit2x I am pretty much done with both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. But if Gavin starts working on Cash I will definitely change my mind!
He is working on it in his own way. In fact, he just helped invent Graphene, a new technology just announced which may render much of the 'big block debate' obsolete, at least when it comes to bandwidth.
Hear, hear!
So stoked with Gavin's endorsement!
We forgive you for creating the Core...
Bullish!
Loving BCH now. Can’t even lie. I️ made a great decision.

"I’m a full on big block supporter but there is an argument that a lot on the cash side are missing : 

https://twitter.com/ccatalini/status/929378766543040513?s=17

This is 100% true as well as the fact that a deflationary currency does not lend all its strengths to transactions and is why all current fiats are inflationary. Bitcoin Cash is different the right way forward but that doesn’t mean it’s ideal either. There’s a lot of work left to be done. "
"I have respect for all he did in the past, but he also said, that he's sure that Craig Wright is Satoshi Nakamoto - and he is definitely not.

So don't belief in everything he says."
"I'm new to it, but very very happy with Bitcoin Cash and what it stands for. When I got interested in Bitcoin a few years ago, I saw it as an amazing new way to do transactions with people.

 I respect people who want to use bitcoin to store value, but I want to actually be able to use my cryptocurrencies and promote their adoption, not just watch the price.  "
Can someone explain the outcome of the EDA hard fork on Monday to me?  I think I understand it but want to make sure.
"None of this would have happened if /u/gavinandresen had just rolled over.

It can't have been easy for Gavin to fork his own project in 2015, but he did it.

All the slings and arrows he's taken since then ... maybe they were easier than that first decision.  We'll have to ask him.
"
I don't understand how people can't understand this. It's both or it isn't worth anything. BTC literally equals tulips at this point. If you can't use it, why even have wallets? BCH can be used for everything AND STILL have all of the advantages of BTC, as designed.
We love you, Gavin !
All we need to set BCH in motion to becoming  the best crypto for both store of value and a means of exchange would be an alpaca sock vendor to accept BCH. Then the rest will begin to fall into place.
"~~Bitcoin~~ Bitlead: a store of ~~value~~ sunk cost fallacies

Seems like things went wrong for btc when its main selling point became the size of its market cap."
Oh how the mighty have fallen,  If Gavin partners with Ver and Jihan, maybe they can get Karpeles to be their spokes person and Craig to be their patent grabber.
UPVOTE HIS TWEET, WE HAVE TO LET EVERYONE KNOW!
"Fuck yeah. I bought into BTC back when we had the dream of electronic cash. It actually worked and I've used it to buy stuff back in the day. BTC is a hollow shell of its former self now and more and more people are realising this. As far as I can tell many of the people on /r/bitcoin cling due to religion, nothing more. A guy on there revealed to me that he used BTC to buy something and paid equivalent of $2 fees. It was probably higher, of course.

It makes me laugh that on /r/bitcoin right now they are calling this an ""attack"" on BTC! No, motherfuckers, BTC just went through a temporary blip, had to change it's name to BCH, the currency known as BTC had a bubble, but now Bitcoin is continuing to the moon."
If this isn't obvious market manipulation idk what is. Not even saying he's wrong, just the fact that he chose now, of all times, to say this.
"It is safe to say a lot of people are on the fence.

On one side, there appears to be usd buying into btc.

On the other side, you have bch backdoored to distribute its currency.

Not disagreeing btc needs to come up with a solution for payment providers asap. More or less, they have been sitting around arguing instead of integrating."
That was seven years ago. Technology moves quickly.
Oh boy... here comes the crash.  We're really over extended!
That is HUGE.  So now we have Andresen plus Satoshi (Craig Wright) behind BCH while BTC can't even perform the most minimal of upgrades.
He was kicked out of Core right as it started going evil.  There's nothing to forgive, he had literally 0 hand in any of the bad parts.
"""a store of value AND means of exchange""
so... like Bitcoin?"

Graphene as in Eos/Dan Larimer Graphene? This is interesting to see but I've never seen Gavin mentioned in Graphene before. You got a link I could see? If this is for real this would be awesome.
Basically it will be better at adjusting, and preventing the miners from exploiting the extreme ups and downs in difficulty. this should lead to a more stable difficulty
"He has done it, literally him and mike could not do it on their own they actually needed people to understand why and then build momentum to do it.

"Nah, we saw this coming years ago.  ""Development should be decentralized,"" we said.  ""One team with one process is too easy to subvert.

I think it's important to stay in there if you can bear the noxious smarminess. Even if you only upvote and downvote, it helps others become aware that there's life outside that echo chamber.
"To be fair, this subreddit is often a cesspool as well.  The good thing is that you can freely say it while only being heavily down-voted instead of kicked.  ;) "
"Indeed,

Even if you are banned, it's not very difficult to create a new account and change your IP if you were so desperate to get back into a propagandists wet dream.

"O wow. What's he doing going on about pow change. Luke Jr works with maxwell but he's kind of out there on many of his thoughts at times

I think you did kind of overstate that it's core devs. Not just luke Jr who quite a lot of people disagree with on  things I would be quite surprised about a PoW. I read recently that maxwell doesn't think a pow change would do much anyways "

And of course there's no public moderator logs for /r/bitcoin. But that is what shills do, they accuse others of doing what they are doing themselves. That is why israel even when killing more than 500 children try to make it out it was the enemies fault. No limit to shamelessness.
Yes, I love watching the roller-coasting Bitcoin's antics every 3 days.  Gives me a laugh.  Cheers to you (insert LeonardoDiCapio.gif)

Mods can get notifications of any words they want right? Or phrases? Then they check 
They do. They have bots set up to monitor keywords across many subreddits.
Greg is so bad at being likeable.
Is it possible it wasn't greg that reported your post? 
"I too was [banned in the middle of a conversation with Gregory Maskwell](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/69xs2c/bitcoin_dev_and_blockstream_employee_actually/dhb6lqa/?context=5).

He denied having a hand in my ban.

In my case too there was discussion of how Gregory Maskwell and other Core developers and Blockstreamers supported a shit fork (not PoW change but UASF). They try to deny supporting and even authoring the fork coins and [scam coins](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6yeo46/is_blockstreams_lukejr_the_only_person_to_ever/dmndclq/?context=1) as long as possible. In the last minute [Gregory Maskwell did come out pushing and shilling for even BIP 148, even though he tried hard to find excuses for it (I refuted those)](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6yvra2/ulukejr_doesnt_know_what_to_do_with_himself_when/dmriho9/?context=3). I wouldn't be surprised if the same happens with a PoW change shit fork.

In another instance [Blockstream CEO plugged into a conversation (in other words, did positive PR for) a premined, PoW-changing scam coin](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/734i6s/as_it_turns_out_adam_backblockstream_may_be/)."

Interesting, message the mod that banned you and copy this in and I'm sure you'll get unbanned. It's hard to have a perfect enforcement of rules. But in general you have to be careful to not come off as purely making things up. A lot of real fake FUD out there

Indeed rather low quality nowadays:)
Not for as long as I was a mod. But it's trivial to set such thing up with google alerts.
"Who really knows.  I've seen Greg go around a lot responding to people saying ""reported for misinformation"", though.  So given that he immediately found my post in some way, and both HIS post, and the ""reason for being banned"" included the word ""misinformation"" it seems pretty likely that it was him.  Se la vie.  I guess I am in this subreddit now."
Right on. Thank you for your opinion. 
"- Their return rate (approx 1% a day) is waaay too good to be true even for Crypto business.
- Nobody really know who the owners/managements are.

Not sure if anyone have really made any money. More like they put in $$$, and have been paid small amount back for a while, not ROI yet. They also encourage people to reinvest their money for compound return, so most probably have never withdrawn.
I suspect one might have trouble trying to withdraw all their investment."
"Oh really? I guess I've only gone on there in mobile.

But if you have RES you can turn off the subreddit style and vote again "
"Hey, I totally get what you are saying. 

The reason why I made the statement about ""core devs"" is because I had literally went to a bitcoin dev meetup with Greg Maxwell attending in San Francisco,  and in the conversations that I had overheard and had with him, it really seemed like Greg, and other Core devs were wishy washy about the whole thing. 

They basically admitted that they were pro-POW change, but understood that this was controversial, and were unwilling to go on  the record to support it. 

If it had not been because of these in person conversations that I had had with them, then I would have not made these claims.

I think this is why I got banned.  They DO support a POW change, but understand that it is extremely controversial. Therefore they want to stop all rumors of their opinions on it, before they are 100% certain that it can succeed."
"If BCH is successful enough that it manages to maintain a majority of hash power, or at least the oscillations prove disruptive enough for BTC, I will not be surprised at all if they ratchet up FUD of it being an attack by miners and pull a PoW fork ""to save bitcoin.""    

Their censored forums and variety of core-biased resources around the web have done a masterful job of reframing the discussion to be on their terms.   People take for granted that BCH is centralized.   They take for granted that core are the only people skilled enough to develop the software.  They take for granted that BTC will hold value indefinitely while having limited utility and high fees.   People wear their dragons den hats with pride.   

Its a lot like Fox news, but in a world where Rupert Murdoch also bought the New York Times and Twitter.   People like being followers because they're uncomfortable thinking for themselves.   People naturally seek an authority to give them the certainty that they're following the right path.   I have every confidence their propaganda machine can find a way to sell PoW fork.    Once finished, they'll slam BCH for wasting electricity.    They'll claim superior decentralization by employing PoW that works on GPU, but all their minion miners will be running the same Core Central Committee Program..."
how many people have been banned in the last 24 hours? 10? Let's see the comments they were banned for. Next you will tell me that /u/hoaxchain was a 'spammer'. Massive censorship here by bitcoinxio and todu.

"> Even if you only upvote and downvote

Bad news.  The sort order is usually reversed on threads that actually matter, so your ""upvote"" is actually hiding the conversation you thought you were helping to elevate in the discussion."
A fair point that I will consider.

"OMG! THIS! Literally 2 minutes after I had made my post, Greg Maxwell responded and likely reported my post. 

I think they must have some sort of Google notifications set up, that pings their phone whenever certain things are mentioned on reddit."
At least 40h/week. It's not a waste of time because they're getting paid to push the Blockstream narrative.
Do you use Reddit? Shit man by 2 AM I’m refreshing like a crack addict hoping for that next new posting
Yes.. It's not a part time job to monitor that much content. I think they have a few cheap staff doing it which might explain why there seems to be a lot of randomness in who they ban and for how long.
"> How much time do these mods have to monitor all these posts to ban people.

Ignorance is Strength!
Banned for stating [my experience reading Mike Hearn and Satoshi's email exchange](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6wz65z/banned_from_rbitcoin_today_my_thoughts/).
Redditor for longer than the exsistance of genisis block. r/Bitcoin is the only sub I am and have ever been banned from. 
r/bitcoin is rapidly becoming a joke. I hate the way they close down any meaningful discussion. It is bigoted and their Frat/Brat pack rhetoric makes me sad that newcomers have to see Bitcoin represented in such a crass and dishonest way.
"Every not so often, we get a post like this of someone who - quite literally, unfairly, has to come to this side due to the asking of simple questions, which they don't like...
I recently spoke to Roger Ver in person, and he said something profound ""Even if they are right, the fact they resort to censorship tells they're doing something wrong""..."

"I got banned today for saying that 'anyone saying anything positive about bch gets banned' I didn't even say anything else besides that

"Your story - pretty close to how I got banned. 

Except I didn't get the misinformation badge. I think they didn't have that one back then.

Looking back, don't miss that place."
"Likewise. I linked a fellow redditor to /r/noncensored_bitcoin to show the extent to which this is happening and I was insta banned. Reason? ""misinformation"".

I was like you, thinking that the censorship was all conspiracy theory. I'm now a bitter redditor who can't stop talking about the level of censorship on that sub... And in a technology which can do so much to prevent corruption and censorship.

I should add, Bitcoin.org and Bitcoin.com are as bad as each other."
"I was permabanned years ago for pointing out that they were abusing their ability to change the default sorting order in specific threads to change the perceived community sentiment of a subject.

Out of interest, why would you doubt thousands of people saying they had been banned and censored?"
"It took me a bit more serious pissing off of nullc to be permabanned, but yeah, that usually does the trick. Depending on his mood of the day one little infarction is all it needs.

Clogscreamcore not in total control of rbitcoin, yeah, sure, as soon as anybody pisses of their CTO in the slightest it's a bannin...

There's nothing wrong with Clogscreamcore running a subreddit, forum and github with total control and use it as their propaganda/missinformation platform. Plenty of companies do so.

What is wrong is not admitting to it. If channels of communication are used to promote or endorse your product/company, you have a legal obligation to disclose that fact. If you do not, you're in deep shit.

If you do not disclose your influence on those channels of communication when it relates to things that can be deemed financial instruments, you're so deep in the shit you must be in a submersible shitmarine."
By now there is something wrong with anyone who is not banned there.
It's very possible you were already shadowbanned anyway (have you ever checked to see if your comments were still there when you're logged out?) - I have the impression this has become their new favorite tactic...

Poked fun at Luke jr, insta ban after that 
This right here is why, as soon as I find out that any forum is heavily censored, I immediately stop posting in it. It seems fruitless to sink a bunch of work into forming connections with other people in a space where the rule is that people are constantly muzzled, and kicked out permanently on a whim. Perhaps take this as a spur to taking anti-censorship seriously online, and putting your time into communities that also take it seriously, whether they are Bitcoin-related or not. That's why I quit Facebook.
"> I am sorry I ever doubted the claims of censorship on /r/Bitcoin 

Most people can't believe it. Until it happens to them! :D"
Yeah I corrected some history after over a year of heavy contributions there and was banned, really an eye opener
"If you disagree with the Blockstream's policies you will get banned for being a ""lying troll""."
I just had a post silently removed. I am officially now a lurker and never going to post or comment again. 
I wonder how many people there are like you still there. It is pretty easy to get banned. That place is a self destructing echo chamber designed to make the mods and people they are agree with feel comfy and unchallenged. They thought they could control Bitcoin... instead they destroyed the community... and ended up leading to the creation of Bitcoin Cash which very well may destroy their goals completely.

I got permanently banned from r/writingprompts the other day for saying something along the lines of ""wow, this prompt sure gets posted a lot"" and was promptly banned despite not saying anything rude. I politely asked if my permanent ban could be reduced to a temporary one (even going so far as to agree if they felt I deserved the ban then I was happy with a temporary one) but they instead chose to rudely berate me in their reply and then started to ignore me.

The real kicker is that mod chat is now set up so that users can't see which mod they are communicating with, giving the mods another layer of protection to hide behind.

So I can tell you with certainty that nothing is going to change, and if you want to continue posting in r/bitcoin then just make a new account. As long as you don't go around saying ""I made this account to get around my shitty unfair ban"" nobody is going to know and nobody will do anything about it. "

How can bch do this if you can only trade Bitcoin for bch? Or can you buy with fiat too?
Stop laughing and MARK THIS DAY
Not a first but impressive nevertheless. Here's a recent example of Eth overtaking BTC: https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-has-higher-trade-volumes-than-bitcoin-as-fortunes-reverse
Wait for the tipping thread or start one and someone may join. The future of charity and cooperation!
"#NO!

Do not send btc to your bch wallet!

Btc and bch are different blockchains. If you send your btc to a bch address it will not go there. It will not leave the btc chain. It will go to that address on the btc chain 

You do not have the private key to that address on the btc chain. You will lose all that btc. 

Read that again. 

The bch chain is A COPY of the btc chain as of August 1. Think about it. You’ll figure it out.

"Two weeks ago if you told me it would go from $300 to $500 I would have laughed.  At $600 I WONDERED if it COULD go to $1,000 this month.

I think it is on its way to $2,500 in the near term."
"And it’s coming from BTC. Not new money. 

Let’s see where we are at in a few weeks. You need the ability to trade fiat for BCH. Otherwise, it’ll be a pump and dump."

That's not a healthy raise. I mean BCH +40% even though Chinese guys moving their assets into it. It's just unhealthy and won't go unnoticed.
Segwit2x getting canceled was the best thing that could have happened to BCH.
"> You do not have the private key to that address on the btc chain

I guess I'm not sure what this means. I have a bitcoin wallet and there is bitcoin in there. I bought the bitcoin with my coinbase app & sent it to my bread wallet.

I was looking at this:
https://www.bitcoin.com/guides/how-to-access-your-bitcoin-cash-bcc-bch

But, to be honest. It doesn't make a damn bit of sense and neither does what you're saying. I guess I'm dumb. :/"
of that many of you (not me LOL) have 3 or 10 accounts
My guess is that it is very private since it incorporates ZCash. 
Yeah, Core and their supporters.

Bitch.. Erm No. A typo.
"Cool so I clicked it and it said 

WITHDRAW AMOUNT ADDRESS

I would just get rid of amount address and copy/paste my BCH wallet there? Seems easy enough thanks man! Cool idea"
Thanks sir
"When trading opened even if somebody put the buy order for $1 worth of BCH at a rate of $600K per the first sell would fulfill their order first and that would be ""the price"" if only for a fraction of a second."
Given that the volume for that hour of trading was ˜15k yes some part.
That's some shady character.  Rather than diverting attention from 'the threat', it seems they managed to draw helpful attention, while tarnishing their own reputation, eh?
lol
"Almost there. You replace ""AMOUNT"" with how much you wanna withdraw."

Good idea. It's not the tethers themselves that are interesting, but the fact that they are not to be trusted and are responsible for a very significant amount of trading activity.
"Yep. But they control the original Bitcoin sub, the first Bitcoin forum, and the first wiki too; and have a lot of influence in other places, so there is a lot of people that only heard their side of the story and haven't realized they're not the good guys."
"I mean they couldn't have made that any clearer I'm obviously just an idiot hahahahaha thanks for clearing that up.

Like i said, only been here a day. Bought a couple BCH yesterday for fun after selling all my bitcoin and I woke up today freaking out that it went up so much. Next thing you know I'm here. Seems like a good community. "
It can only happen when a market opens really because if I were to go place a ridiculous order on an existing market like a buy for $600k/BCH it would be fulfilled simply at the cheapest sell order which right now would be like $1000/BCH. To push the price to $600K now I would have to buy up the entire orderbook worth of sell orders in one shot before anybody can react and relist which would cost tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars.
"It started as a shortform of bitcoin cash, then someone took took offence that it didnt include the word bitcoin and the bcash project was suddenly announced to combat this.

Check google histrory"
I think anyone who doesn’t see this as a pump and dump is delusional 
"It started as a social attack from the small blocker crowd. They registered the bcash subreddit and some urls and began pushing a united narrative of bcash instead of bitcoin cash, trying to remove the world bitcoin and more importantly control primary namespaces to continue the censorship.

Then, some nifty big blockers went and made an actual bcash project that you see there. A good run-around the dirty smear tactics."

Half the volume is South Korean Won https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin-cash/#markets

"Funny and stupid story. I don't.

I bought BTC on Coinbase. They closed my account. Made a big post on /Coinbase/ about it. 

It's the best thing they ever did for me. They allowed me to transfer funds out for FREE (saved a few grand in fees). They never gave explanation as to why. However, my thought process is because I owned so much BTC, they probably just wanted to shaft me from the January 1 BCH integration, and getting my free monies.



 It forced me to download Exodus. I was done buying anyways. Now, I just Shapeshift and hold the funds on my wallet. Big woop, I paid a little extra on Shapeshift than going thru an Exchange.



As mentioned, Im done buying. I just move freely from one coin to another, but am now staying with BCH.

For the lazy, complacent, dgaf, easy mode, etc - see below.

www.coinbase.com

www.shapeshift.io

www.exodus.io"
Couldn't it just be Ver buying and selling back to himself, and his Chinese friends on a zero fee exchange? 
Actually, this is the second time for BCH. The first was August 19th.
Hard fork?
Sure can 200 bits u/tippr 
Yup, self trading on one single exchange. Great achievement! 
The final pump!
"January lads. Get in and hold on tight. 

EDIT. My badz, that's withdrawels for bitcoin holders. If things keep up the way they are we could see Coinbase offering it earlier. it's about to be a wild ride. "
BCH #1 rising global currency in the world in South Korea. 
start your own exchange?
Dunno how long this can last. Bitcoin Cash could hold long above $1000 https://coincodex.com/crypto/bitcoin-cash/
Bitcoin Cash is like cash 💸 but cannot burn. Bitcoin is like gold 💳 but it is less than Facebook regarding its market cap #Facebookdown #XVAcoin that moment is showing the future. No New York Agreement, no bullshit bingo can stop Bitcoin. Bitcoin Cash is fast. Bitcoin is trust. I think Bitcoin Cash will have a higher turnover and market cap? in 2018... I do not know and I do not care. At least both will beat Ether or any other Altcoin. Thank you Satoshi Nakamoto. I am convinced Bitcoin (Bitcoin + Bitcoin Cash) will be above 100.000 USD on the money market (that is trader slang and means investments up to 1 or 2 years) the XVA Coin will safeguard the Bitcoin. No big whales, no derivatives bullshit, the XVA Coin is your Big Brother. Roger Ver, pls buy more and do not try to B2X, please HODL with us. More Fiat to Bitcoin, pls

"Whereas BTC from $3k to nearly $8k in a few weeks is healthy?

Price up is price up.  Price up is attention and new money.  Price up creates optimism and excitement.

BCH is going to $100,000!!!"
We're all good, we see economic utility the same.
"Classic pump before the dump. To quote someones observations:

Just let the numbers sink in:

* Entire market cap trades in 3 days, while most of the BCH still sitting idle on addresses of early BTC adopters.
* New supply is just 0.036% of daily volume and BCH believers claim to hodl onto their coins and to buy more
* Even if the free float is 10% (coins sitting on these exchanges and are actively traded), it means each BCH is traded at least 3 times per day.

Bottom line: someone is playing games here.

Disclaimer: Probably totally legal in some jurisdictions.

BCC? I'm hodling since yesterday.

You're still believing this is a possibility at this point?
No one even has bcash. 
I would advise you to either remove this comment or modify it... you should never mention how much money you have and especially not where you are holding it. Exodus is not safe wallet at all, and with that much money hardware wallet is must have.

Of course! Seems more genuine than what I seen before.
What exchange do you use for bth?
Ill get some aswell if you dont mind.

Tiz okay. At these prices he can even call it shitcash, I don't care, esp once bcore crashes taking down jluke and the bstream with it
"Bcash *

"Even his name is a derivation of one of our well-respected regular posters. ""Bad faith"" is just the beginning with these people."

"you call someone a cunt and get $2 in BCH

you're all a bunch of cunts!

waiting..."
Let us hope this is just one of many firsts for BCH. I think we should think about a major flip in their positions if the volume stays this way for weeks. Not just for a day.
You can also use that same bot to give people gold, paying BCH for it.
In that rise, BTC was only going up at most 12% in a day. This 40% in 24 hours is very very suspect
:)
I hope so, not a particular fan of BCH or BTC - both are cool and have their advantages. But I don’t ser BCH goingo over 5k$ any time soon. I may be wrong tho, it’s only my opinion. 
Not the first time but thanks for the misleading title. 
Isn't the advice to never keep your coins on an exchange? Do you really think much BTC is stored on exchanges in this post-gox world?
Still bearish mate?
Oh boy, the asses on you small blockers are red hot. This is fun to watch.

How does that work?

A ton of merchants are hinting at leaving btc and goi g for either BCH/eth

Because of liquidity and security. Bitcoin is mined using SHA256 while Litecoin is using scrypt which is less secure. Also BCH has liquidity ATM trumping Ltc market cap by over 5x.

No. It's not a bad summary of Art of War, but it's not from there.
"Can you point to any evidence of this? Everything I have read from Luke Mow and maxwell indicate they are statists. Especially Luke. 

And look at what they are doing. Centralising bitcoin while using doublespeak to gaslight the community into believing they are ensuring decentralisation. 

"
Cash, only better.
Why do you say that? These are anti-government people in the small block community. You really think the likes of Luke, Mow, Maxwell and Todd are socialists?
"> You really think the likes of Luke, Mow, Maxwell and Todd are socialists?

They're **statists**. Fiercely anti-competition and pro-censorship. Statism is broader than socialism. They don't against capitalism per se, it has to be ""correct capitalism"" without ""corporate takeovers"""
Wow... I thought I was the only lefty who didn't support corruption and totalitarianism...
"""One strategy to protect against this would be to accept alerts from network nodes when they detect an invalid block, prompting the user's software to download the full block and alerted transactions to confirm the inconsistency""

This is not viable in the way Satoshi envisaged."
"Funny thing is they accuse Ver of being pro-banks and establishment.

Those core folks have cognitive dissonance I believe. Anti-centralisation at heart but money and job security made them support a very centralised cause.

You ae probably right about Luke. His religious beliefs seem to indicate that."
"Yeah they make lots of accusations but I do my best to ignore the noise and try to look at the actual situation and what can be verified. 

What can be verified? 

- segwit and off chain scaling (centralisation) 
- wanting to rewrite white paper 
- demonising miners who ensure security of the network
- contradicting satoshi who created bitcoin (as if core know better) 
- mass censorship on a grand scale
- multiple splits of bitcoin and community
- bitcoin to be the saviour of the third world unbanked poor to a store of value for the wealthy first world only

You are right about Luke his ideas are dangerous and go against the very fundamental principles of bitcoin. 

Bitcoin is libertarian and capitalist. It's inevitable that bitcoin will be invaded by the rest of the ignorant misguided masses. The only thing that can be done to protect bitcoin is to ensure that the way it functions doesn't change. Core have tried to subvert bitcoin and change it. "
Majority of people are left-leaning. I was. But I'm dead sure that there're more lefties in small blocker community percentage-wise
It depends on why they want to come back. If you deliberately set fire to your own house, don't be surprised if I'm not too excited to invite you in to mine.
"Bitcoin (settlement) would certainly not be the only chain you want to publish to. 

Publishing a simple message or a hash on another blockchain should be an industry best practice in my opinion. I can think of plenty of uses for being able to check my favorite blockchain against another blockchains records. By no means would I suggest to 'anchor' bitcoin cash to bitcoin settlement.

I have plenty of confidence in BCH relative to BTC that I don't have to use the word 'if'.

What I don't see is the total demise of BTC."
"*""Card or cash?""*

Serious thought: 20 years from now, your ""card"" would literally be funded by cryptocurrencies (as some already are today!). ""cash"" would be a literal on-chain transaction of BCH. This is the future I signed up for."

They could also ultimately do a proper increase of the block size. This is the one thing that is keeping me from selling all my BTC.
"I hold Bitcoin Cash. If you can anchor your blockchain tech to Bitcoin, then you can *also* anchor it to *Bitcoin Cash*. But the latter will be cheaper and just as dependable. You do the math.

Bitcoin really has no choice but to scale massively on-chain. And thanks to Bitcoin Cash, you can argue ""Bitcoin"" is doing this regardless of what Bitcoin Core thinks.

If Bitcoin Cash rises in popularity while Bitcoin Core stagnates, society at large will shorten Bitcoin Cash to ""Bitcoin"" out of sheer convenience, and at that point your anchor chain is no longer ""Bitcoin"", having been replaced by Bitcoin Cash, which is an anchor chain and a whole lot more."
"Wise words from Jihan i think..
I don't own btc ór bch yet. I just want crypto to succeed for all of our benefit. Btc has proven it can carry crypto on it's back already, why take the chance to ruin that with something unproven? Most people don't give a shit about one coin or the other, they only care about the coin they currently have or will make them the most profit.
Proven facts: btc high fees it still pumps. Btc long confirmation times it still pumps. Btc loose 50% miners it still pumps.
Maybe, perhaps maybe, it would be in all our best interest to let btc take on fiat first by being the safest store of value we currently have and try to take as much of gold's marketshare as possible.(i do have gold btw...)
And when btc liquidity and trust and fame is even much much higher we can have a look at what other technology is available for using it as cash also and try to reach consensus about what the best option is, or just start a NON-contencious fork.(which shouldn't be a problem if your that convinced the idea is better. (Yes i know, it's not the original plan... just like every world changing invention was never the plan, mostly conicidence-fact)

"
>If Bitcoin Cash rises in popularity while Bitcoin Core stagnates, society at large will shorten Bitcoin Cash to ""Bitcoin"" out of sheer convenience

The Graphene research makes this even more probable, even in only a few years time.
"> why take the chance to ruin that with something unproven? 

Like high fees, unreliable confirmation times, a totally new financial model for transaction pricing and reliance on second layer solutions in 18 months for issues that need addressing in 2016?

You know what is proven? Blocksize increasing as demand and adoption increases. It has almost a decade of being proven as being an absolutely fantastic way of advancing success."
I have a fair and reasonable attitude especially considering the history and circumstances.
No need to defeat Core because Core destroys itself. 
Nice advice. The war is not amongst ourselves
convenient temporary altruism, generally the signature of a manipulator
For something to be so decentralized and so democratized, cryptocurrency seem to be under the sway and whim of just a few people. That's true for BCH, BTC, ETH, and pretty much all of them. This is seriously concerning for me. It's very easy for these people or any small group of people to be corrupted and be ultra greedy. I go in btc or bch related places and I see names of these Jihan's, Ver's, etc. These people should not be a factor in crypto. Yet they are. 
Yep. It's insane
"Lots of comments saying that Jihan is a fool looking for appeasement with core need to read the tweet again. 

My take is that this is a pre eulogy for bitcoin/core and advice to bch community to not alienate the wider crypto community. 

We walk the same walk with the same goal. No need to argue with each other. "
He's back!
It's an unrealistic option. Yes, I'm hedging my bets also. Anything can happen

Hashrate follows price but there is no guarantee of equilibrium. Price is dictated by supply and demand.
True.  I hadn't actually noticed the BCH upgrade would activate so soon after the difficulty re-target.
"> due to Emergency Difficulty Adjustment and will probably swing back next Monday.

Will it? the fork is set for monday too. If it comes before, we'll avoid a crazy swing."
Imagine where we'd be if he helped us along the way. 
3h average
Not until it has more accumulated proof of work than BTC.  But while it has a higher hash rate it will continue to gain back the lost ground rather than fall further behind.  If it has the majority hash rate for long enough, it'll catch up entirely and then surpass BTC and there's no way people will be switching back.

It'd perhaps be worrisome if this was to continue for a long time. But that problem will be a thing of the past on Monday when the new DAA activates.
I don't think the rate of coin generation at the moment is likely to have a significant impact on the price given the huge liquidity. The total coins to be mined remains the same, and difficulty will be adjusted soon, so in the long term it certainly won't have a significant impact.
Won't be necessary. It's legacy code like many other lines to keep compatibility with the ledger
Exactly.... Eda is not part of the white paper, but so isn't segwit. Good thing is, Eda can be removed.... Segwit poison can't be removed

The main crypto coin like Satoshi envisioned it. Fast transactions, low fees, P2P etc 
"Bitcoin Cash, a fork of Bitcoin that aims to be true to the original Bitcoin whitepaper (peer-to-peer digital cash).

Bitcoin was designed to settle conflicts via such forks, so that no one group can ever control Bitcoin unconditionally. Bitcoin Cash came to be because Bitcoin/BTC (nominally the original Bitcoin project) has diverged from the original vision and is trying to become digital gold rather than digital cash."

Yes, I think that's pretty likely - but too brief to show up in the charts because of the averaging period, so we'll never know for sure.

Works? No it doesn''t we're mining 30 blocks an hour when the normal rate don't go above 10!
Just a swing in the difficulty of mining nad, consequently, the hashpower swing. The price might be completely unaffected. Hell, the BCH price might even go up because now more of those BTC sell transactions will go through.
Correct me if I am wrong but isn't DAA hardfork? So don't all the miners have to agree to it otherwise we get 2 BCH. Are all BCH miners running the new update?
Nice! the site is slow to catch up then
Sure, I agree that it should be opt-in but not having the option isn't a plus in my book.  And it really depends on what kind of 2fa you are talking about TOTP is very good.  Crap that is easily defeated like using SMS isn't great.
EDA is on certain block. The fix is on certain date and time. And they are very close.
"... the point of an EDA mechanism was to get BCH through a chain split with some bumps rather than complete meltdown. It did exactly that. Worked perfectly from the point of view of meeting all the minimum requirements of the job it was intended to do.

There was mining 30 blocks an hour while the hash rate was shifting around between BTC and BCH.  Once all the hash rate is in BCH it'll never activate unless there's a significantly powerful fork that starts another Bitcoin fork war."
It is a hard fork. Multiple big miners have supported it, it's not likely that if a miner spends the time/resources to keep the old chain alive that it will have much community support since those users would be saying the current EDA is preferable to the new one.
Not exactly, it updates every block, so there's quite a variation between the time you go and check it out and someone else does.
I can agree that having it as an option is definitely necessary for every exchange that wishes to appear as professional. Perhaps I did not explain myself properly earlier. I just hate it if I am enforced to use 3rd party software/hardware when I don't feel any justification for it. I use generated passwords for every website, so forcing 2FA on me is often times just irritating.
Makes sense. I think I was questioning it because hardfork was so contentious in BTC land and called off at the last moment. I guess this is what happens when rational people come together.
For sites that use the TOTP standard (Google auth for example) you can get a Yubi key and load the shared secret into it making it super secure and not connected to your phone or web browser.  Basically impossible to hack.  Even generated passwords are susceptible to key loggers.  2FA resists key loggers which strong passwords can't protect against.
Exactly. Hard forking is natural and with consensus it is invisible to users. 
A split if possible, but unlikely. Is there a market for the EDA coin? I think not. There must be support from exchanges for a market to emerge and probably some other factors as well. We'll see how it goes.
Kraken.com. Bitcoin.de.
Yes, although he specified elsewhere that it is the chain with most proof of work behind it. (chain with the most cumulative difficulty)
"oh please, I have had more than enough bullshit conversations on that topic. 2FA should always be opt-in. never enforced. bittrex is the shittiest exchange I know for enforcing it. this 2FA praising is as outdates as teaching object-oriented programming as the ultimate truth in universities, both philosophies have been ""debunked"" by now. 2fa only gives you false sense of security and it makes life harder for those who know how what they are doing and are willing to be responsible for the means they have chosen for securing their accounts."
Just cos picture is behind the clock
The picture shows the 12h average, people are looking at the last 3h average.
"yeah but does that even matter anymore?

the whole btc chain's transactions over the last 4 months aren't going to be orphaned so that metric is moot right now

we have replay protection, difficulty algorithm changes, any everything which the white paper didn't even predict."
"Satoshi is better mathematician than writer and he can't foresee all possible confusion

In whitepaper:

Nodes = mining nodes

Longest chain = chain with the most cumulative difficulty"
But update is supposed to be on a certain block or time?
Well there will be miners that will mine even at loss, so it won’t be this bad (“15 hours with almost no blocks”).
"Right — as soon as Bitcoin Cash was created as a separate chain with replay protection, the longest-chain measures no longer became relevant to deciding between BTC and BCH. They became separate coins. Nakamoto consensus does not apply to separate coins. The fact that miners can still mine both chains is an artifact of the fact that they are using dedicated computers designed specifically for the SHA256 hash algorithms. If they were using general computers, then they could mine *any* coin including altcoins, and they probably would, if it were more profitable. But because they have such dedicated equipment, they can only mine SHA256, which at present includes Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. That's why the two are fighting for the same pool of miners. It has nothing to do with 'longest chain' or Nakamoto consensus mechanisms.

However, it does make things very inconvenient for the coin that most of the miners abandoned, because the mining difficulty will end up too high and need to be adjusted prematurely. Which is not that hard to do, but it is still a great PR victory.

At least, that is the way I understand the situation."

Good deal.
"He did absolutely the right thing by leaving, both for himself and for Bitcoin.

He would have been an unbelievably big political target and he would have slipped up and been tracked down eventually.

As for Bitcoin, it has successfully proved itself as a self governing decentralised system without a figurehead - which is the entire point of its invention.  Blind adherence to leaders is the exact cause of the current switch to Bitcoin Cash."
What do you guys mean by 'swing'? That the price will go down, or up?
I heard 12 hours later although I have not confirmed this timespan for myself.
It's based on time so no earlier fix.
"Per my Bitcoin ABC 0.16.0 node, as of block #503012:

    ""networkhashps"": 5.3628389548634e+18

That's ~5.36 EH/s"
But the EDA should be left in...  It obviously works, if it never needs to activate thats fine and it gives Bitcoin Cash a fighting chance against any future forks to a third iteration of Bitcoin.
"Check your website at the bottom ""3h average"""
Honored to have front row seats.
I just checked [here](https://fork.lol/pow/hashrate) and I don't see it. Where do you see it?
Ultimately it should find equilibrium when the ratio of the two coins prices are the same as the ratio of their hash rates I would think.  It is just that because of the delay in difficulty adjustment right now there are periods when that equilibrium gets out of wack.
I think what you may be missing is that the Bitcoin difficulty adjusted right before the hash rate switched to Bitcoin Cash. Maybe the miners were just waiting for the difficulty to adjust and then switched over....
"This is NOT a good thing.  It means that BCH is inflating faster than BTC and that there will probably be downward pressure on BCH as some miners sell instead of hold.
"
But within hours after that, a BCH hard fork is going through that will change the difficulty algorithm altogether to something that constantly adjusts itself in real-time, so no more of such wild difficulty swings in the future — at least that is the theory I have read.
According to this site it never happened https://fork.lol/pow/hashrate

BCH	62.14%  :)
Can anyone tell me where they would suggest I buy BTC Cash?
"Not everyone is looking at the profitability on a minute-by-minute basis. A lot of miners don't cash out immediately, and foresee the price of BCH hitting BTC's previous highs ($6000-$7500) in which case they'd much rather be earning and holding BCH than having to trade their BTC for BCH later as BTC freefalls in price.
"
Which will improve BTC transaction capacity, which will in turn enable more BTC to be dumped for BCH on exchanges, driving the BTC price down, and BCH price up...
I call that progress 
Where do you see that? Cause [I dont see it here](https://fork.lol/pow/hashrate)

what is BCH?
This is pretty amazing stuff, but I'm super keen for more adoption and then hashrate will follow after DAA EDA. Super Bullish!
Yes, but not really. It is very temporary. When DAA is fixed and we get to the same point, then I'll join the celebration.
Where can I track this info?
When BCH update with EDA fix is supposed to take place? Is it going to make it before next retarget?
"Please note that BCH difficulty will [retarget in a bit over 1 day, and rise 400%](https://fork.lol/pow/retarget).  That will make BTC more profitable to mine again, and there will likely be a mass shift of hash power.

It will be interesting to see where the hash power settles after the new BCH difficulty calculation algorithm, which should reduce the relative profitability oscillations."

"> ou don't understand a main component of banking is the creation of money backed by the creation of debt

You are describing Fractional reserve banking. I learned about this before you were born, most likely...

The banking scheme will have 2 parts/options:

a) Non-borrowing: that's the Liquidity Provider part. There will be an extra time-dependent ""fee"". That's an interest rate.

b) With borrowing: It is very easy to imagine that you could be ""invited"" or ""allowed"" on some channel, where a whale node will either transfer funds to you for you to spend (with a interest-like fee), or will spend the money on your behalf (with an interest-like fee). Of course there will not be money creation. It is a given that the sum of fee movements on a channel or even cross channel, will always be ZERO. That we agree on it.

What I do not understant that you do not understand is this: why do you not see that when a third party provides you with liquidity, you have to PAY for it. Again, this is about opportunity cost, That third party could have productively invested that money elsewhere, but insted, he is investing it on you... well, you gotta pay up. How hard is it to understand???

"""Banking scheme"" is the correct term: bank don't create any money, that's what **central** banks do. What banks do is to take money already created and provide services with it.

LN is to Bitcoin what banks are to fiat. As a matter of fact in all 4 carbon copied posts of your shilling, you wasn't able to provide a single use case where banks can do something bad with a technical explaination of how and why it's not possible on LN. Prove your claim or GTFO."
"And so by that definition BCH has terrible security during its periods where only a small number of pools mine it thanks to the EDA gaming. We agree on that.

You don't think that there's any chance that certain large mining pools could act to increase the mempool and all benefit from increased fees? Fair enough.

>You wanted NOS2W? You're served: now that's the consequences you brought upon yourself, deal with it.

???!!! Huh? I am delighted that Bitcoin yet again stood resilient to attempts to centralise and control. A price drop post-NYA cancellation was obviously going to happen.

No it is not. As you yourself pointed out - a big part of a full-fledged banking system is fractional reserve lending.

You can keep commenting on other things if you like but my point stands - you are trying to paint a perfectly normal email as if it was some evil corporation turning Bitcoin into the current banking system.

There are what a few thousand core nodes? If you can afford to run a node you can afford to run it with bigger blocks.  I don't think anyone that has BCH is against other scaling solutions. We just recognize that we need bigger blocks until other scaling solutions are actually developed BY THE COMMUNITY not by blockstream for there own profit.
I actually do.
[deleted]
cool thanks for something. I'll look into LN and why people claim its banking
"Where has he ever stated or implied he invented Bitcoin.

I will wait for you to find some proof.

Linking to a wikipedia article on hashcash is not proof that he says he invented Bitcoin. Hashcash was cited as a reference in Satoshi's white paper. Where does Adam imply he invented Bitcoin?"
">You get it perfectly right

No he didn't. Anyone can create a LN channel. You need to read what the primary purpose of a bank is. They create money from thin air by creating debt. Every Bitcoin transacted over LN is tied to Bitcoin on the main chain.

The fees you pay are like fees you pay now. 

>The problem is the deception. It's scandalous.

I agree - the complete crap on this post suggesting LN is 'like a bank' is highly deceptive."
"It's not an interest rate. Paying for a service is not an interest rate. You need to google what banking interest rates are. We pay miners for a service now. Is that an interest rate? We pay tumbler services a fee - also not an interest rate.

The narrative you are pushing - LN = banks is pure rubbish. At no point do Bitcoins get created out of thin air."
"I thought you guys had a new super highway to use created by Roger and Jihan?

Why not just use that and stop spending your every day complaining about the people maintaining and expanding the old road?"
"By the way, I have a Masters in Finance... I am so sorry you are not reading my post properly.

There will be 2 fees.

1) Transmission fee (kind of equivalent to the 'mining' fee, since you won't stop talking about it). A one-time fee. A F.E.E. There I said it. Is it clear enough?  

2) The Liquidity service, which will be a FUNCTION OF TIME. That's the interest part of it. I.N.T.E.R.E.S.T. Wath part of it do you not understand. Go read the 3 references I provided.

Get off my lawn, punk."
For high value purchases just wait 10 minutes for the block to confirm.
So he didn't say he created Bitcoin then? He said Bitcoin built and extended on hash cash. If that's not true - why is it cited in the white paper?
I hold BTC too. it's optional. opt in. I'm in. but I didn't opt in to segwitcoin. and I can't opt it out of the protocol. 
"It appears you did not read my post. It clearly explains the 2 VERY different ways LN channels are used. Very first line of the post! One involves no one but the participants (I am sure you like that version of the story), and the second one involves ""bank-like"" entities, aka LIQUIDITY PROVIDERS. It appears you have a misunderstanding of the later part..."

"Again, when using LN to do cross-channel payments, you will hav to pay:  
a) a fee for the transaction  
b) you will also have to compensate the LIQUIDITY PROVIDER for the opportunity cost. They could have decided to do something else with their money, but instead, they allow you to be able to enjoy the full balance of the funds you sent in LN. There is a cost to it, and the longer they provide the service, the higher the cost to you. It's an interest rate, in all shapes or forms, whether you like it or not."

"You know that banks provide money to people that has been created out of the creation of debt right?

At what point is Bitcoin created out of anything in the LN?

Answer - it isn't. Every btc on LN is backed by BTC on the blockchain.

Calling it banking is highly misleading."
">With this banking scheme in place, KYC and AML are going to be mandatory, trust me on that

>it's a full-fledged second layer banking system

It is not a 'full-fledged' banking system. For a guy with a 'Master is finance' - you don't understand a main component of banking is the creation of money backed by the creation of debt. There is no creation of Bitcoin in LN. It's almost as if you don't have a masters in finance huh?"
It can’t compete at any level, in some ways lightning can.
"Vaporware means it doesn't exist, how is something that exists vaporware? 

Yes it's distant and yes BTC will continue to suffer from not increasing block size and being stuck as is until a year plus from now when we start using LN (and even after then). They doesn't change that it's not vaporware. "
You really don’t understand that 10 minutes is ages in the trading realm...
Take it as you wish, but if you have that kind of line on your Twitter profile you are implying a lot. He got called out on it and changed it. 
Remember the key think about why banking - bad in this context is banks (central then local) create and issue money that has been created out of thin air by the creation of debt. Every Bitcoin transacted on LN is underpinned by Bitcoin on the blockchain. Fact. Cheers.
"The whole security of Bitcoin is based on miners not being able to reliably create consecutive blocks and as a consequence cannot reliably collect fees, thus they cannot spam transactions. Not that they need it: they could simply publish blank/censored blocks and get the same effect; you're so blinded by FUD and propaganda you can't even see the obvious.

And yes that graph is totally natural: what you see it's 3 months of pumps expecting segwit2x that's now desperately trying to dump ASAP due to nya cancellation.

It should also be noted that BitPay created an implementation of LN that doesn't require Segwit.

Perhaps you could do the same - why have multiple people commented that LN is 'banking'. It is not. No Bitcoin is created out of thin air. Why are you not asking the people who have likened it to banking to justify what they have said - because it is nothing like banking.
"Do your own research. The explanation you refer to is wrong. 

'Banking scheme' is complete crap - banks create money through debt. LN creates nothing - every Bitcoin is tied to the main chain. 

LN lets you sum up the difference at the the end of a series of back and forth payments between parties and commit the difference to the blockchain.

If you and I were playing cards and we both put $5 in at the start and we were paying each other after each hand in Bitcoin over the blockchain we would waste a lot of money on fees for each tx.

There's also a non-zero chance they could just declare a regular node a money-service business.  Particularly if those nodes are mainly operated by wallet providers serving many SPV clients.
"> akin to an interest rate

No - it is akin to paying fees as we currently do now. If you don't want to use a channel you don't have to. It is a second option for sending Bitcoin. You would have to pay a fee for a service provided, exactly that same as you do currently on Bitcoin. 

>With this banking scheme in place, KYC and AML are going to be mandatory, trust me on that

Banks created money out of thin air through the creation of debt. In NO WAY is LN similar to banking. Every Bitcoin transacted over LN is tied to the main chain. You would pay a fee to use a channel if you wanted to. It simply creates a second option for fees. Don't use it if you don't want to."

Thanks for clarifying Ryan!
After the civil discussion about this on r/bitcoin was deleted, maybe you are right and it's not fake. Strange.
"No it isn't.

Anyone can run a LN node.

The primary purpose of banks is to create money from debt. No additional Bitcoin can ever be created by the Lightning Network - all balances are tied to a transaction on the blockchain.

They are not ""interest rates"" - they are small fees. 

You pay fees now to use the blockchain - do you also label these as 'interest rates'?

Yes. Testnet. It has been available for over a year and yet the Core software doesn't even have Segwit implemented into their wallet UI.
The code has been public and in a freeze for a lot longer than that. If people were anxious to implement it they had all the resources needed to add it and test. There was no consensus or pent up real demand for Segwit as evidenced by the hyped vs reality adoption rate. 
Correct. Segwit empirically is shitty code

Thanks mate. I'll sit on this and digest for now.
So you are saying bitfenix is pumping bch, just like mtgox was trying to pump btc before its collapse?
At least divergent opinions are not censored here
Look there have been high transactions in BTC for weeks now but Core supporters ignored it because of store of value nonsense. And as for the Bitfinex/Tether whale, he was pumping BTC, as from the articles I read on Medium.
What are the price tickers for these other tether?
I will admit that it seems fishy that bitcoin mempool is clogged up just as bch skyrockets and btc takes a dump, but I still see no reason for tether to do this, back when they were bitfinex' sister company they were huge core supporters, and I assume they still are.
Why not post on their main account if they are so knowledgeable

Eth isn't about being sound money.  It's way bigger than that.  Where bitcoin is a digital poker chip, Ethereum is a massive global automated digital economy which happens to also have a digital poker chip at its core.

"[Bitcoin storage can be hacked too, and lose just as much](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitfinex_hack).

Ethereum doesn't seem very likely to fork over this one.

"Except BCH and BTC compete for the same set of miners, and it is only BTC that has no remedy for slow blocks and experiences skyrocketing fees and wildly unreliable confirmation times whenever blocks are slow even *by chance*, let alone slow for weeks/months as they wait for a difficulty adjustment while half the miners are off  mining BCH. Moreover, this dynamic snowballs as the price falls, leading to fewer miners, slower  blocks, even more insane ""just get me out of here!"" fees, and thus lower price, less mining, slower blocks... 

So yes, it is different this time. "
ETH only scales marginally better than BTC, see ICO day slowdowns. ETH plans to try and shard in the future as a difficult hack to try and scale more, whereas BCH can and will easily scale to meet all the demand thrown at it right now and beyond the flippening

I think this sounds very realistic. ETH is preparing for a move and I don't think its that far away. With all the movement to BCH, the market will feel better about leaving BTC and getting behind ETH.
"> Money is flowing from btc not eth

From both systems. Ethereum was providing capacity while Bitcoin Segwit lasted clogged. But transacting in Ethereum and all connected cryptos has many downsides. Bitcoin Cash is the best sound money. No rollbacks, no blowing up smart contracts (yet), no uncertainty about PoW/PoS, constricted supply - just **deflationary economic fuel plain and simple** with already existing giant companies like Coinbase, Xapo and BitPay which will adopt it to stay in the business"
Doubt it. Not when some idiot can wipe out 150 Million with a few keystrokes and force a fork all over again. Good luck with that. 
Agreed. Is there a single ETH project that has more than 10,000 users? No, there isnt. ETH has become a giant pipe-dream circle jerk 
The reason I went partially into ETH is exactly because it's been so stable during all the recent volatility in BTC and BCH. I chose to diversify into something that's a bit more predictable in order to preserve some of the gains I made off of BTC when 2X was in the pipeline
And the miners owning BCH have no reason at all to make legacy Bitcoin competitive against new Bitcoin.

You have no vision.
What about litecoin? Doesn't that threaten bitcoin cash's position?
"> If the fix requires a fork, it's a fucking problem

It does not require a fix. The issue has nothing to do with Ethereum. It's like fixing a broken website (Parity) on Internet that works (Ethereum).

When Mt.Gox was hacked, there was no fix either."
Eth is a different animal from other coins and is much larger in scope. There will be many more forks as it works out its future. That problems will happen along with forks is just part of ethereum growth.
The Parity crash didn't change the value proposition of Ethereum or teach us anything we didn't know, besides that Parity itself was so terribly fucked up.  A fork to fix the problem would likely include some kind of protocol-level smart contract override or failsafe, which would actually improve the value proposition of Ethereum (and knock out some of its competitors operating on that premise).  
"Turing completeness is what you make of it, it's entirely possible to limit the smart contracts you write to a Turning-incomplete subset of Ethereum's functionality if you want. That's what I find so compelling about Ethereum, it's a platform that lets everyone try everything they want on the same playing field.

[There's this proposal,](https://blog.gridplus.io/toward-an-ethereum-multisig-standard-c566c7b7a3f6) for example, which aims to essentially replicate the functionality and simplicity of Bitcoin's multisig wallet on Ethereum.

There's also lots of work being done on new languages for programming smart contracts that have built-in support for formal verification and limit the structures you can use to keep things safer. The underlying EVM bytecode is the same, but the compiled language can have all sorts of limits built into it."
"They were both caused by flaws in wallet security. The main difference is that the recent Parity wallet hack caused tokens to be burned rather than stolen, but that's not much of a difference to the people whose tokens were lost.

The important similarity is that in neither case was the *blockchain*'s behaviour flawed, it was user error that left the tokens vulnerable.

Exchanges aren't the only targets that can be hacked, they're just the most attractive targets because they have so much cryptocurrency in their wallets and they need to frequently access it. Holding your wallet personally doesn't make you unhackable."
I wasn't questioning your end game or the validity of his comment. Just simply stating the fact you can't base someone's knowledge off of their days on Reddit. Which is all your original post did.
"Ad hominem is statists' ""Fuck u"""
"> Turing completeness is what you make of it

That's exactly the issue."
No douche can wipe out my wallet with a couple of key strokes bottom line. 
His account age wouldn't have mattered if what he said wasn't such a provocative comment, I was simply pointing out that once again we have someone telling us how something is when they have next to no community contribution.
Just an observation, not an argument. So no, it's not an ad hom. 
"And that's the case for the vast majority of Ethereum's wallets, too. It was one specific wallet that had flawed coding. Similarly, most Bitcoin wallets are likely secure. But sometimes people make mistakes and leave them open to hackery as well (as Bitfinex did).

The point I was making is that the recent problem with the Parity multisig wallet contract is not a unique flaw in Ethereum, any cryptocurrency is able to lose tokens to malice or happenstance when people make mistakes in how they use those cryptocurrencies."
I'm just arguing with you because I've been up all night trading and I'm crabby. Have a good day lol

Bro what are you talking about. I'm mocking you people for acting like you've all slain Goliath already, not for having a different opinion on the future of bitcoin. 
"most fiat pairs on alts are pumping now.

This is literally nothing new. Bitcoin cash just happened to be the forerunner this time for the alt spike. We've seen this countless times before. It used to be eth, now it's bcash. Same flippening narrative, same story, different coin. 

And, as *always*, ""it's different this time"". "
"i agree to your last point, yet it has the advantage to be the first crypto coin ever. it is a brand. when someone with no knowledge in crypto wants to join now, he maybe just wants to stick with bitcoin and hodl, and he will be fine with it, so of course i could sell him one of mine. it had gained that trustworthy image of gold over nine(!) years now. in a way its like a technics 1200.
i also think that this deviation from the WP is actually no problem at all. i agree that Cash is closer to the WP, but still that doesnt make it the original. i can see a coexistence quite well actually,
however these attackings from both sides against each other will hurt both sides in the long term."

Are you dense? Any contrarian opinion gets downvoted into oblivion here. 
"Bitcoin was supposed to be p2p cash. If you wanted to make some gold out of it then you hard fork and avoid all this contention changing it against the will of all earlier adopters.

The question is if it is expensive to transfer and you don't want to use it for everyday purchases what will you use it for? Why would someone else buy it from you when the time comes for you to sell? It does nothing better than existing substitutes."
It must be hard for you to come to place where different opinions are allowed, don't worry, if you put your mind to it I am sure you can get use to it.
"""Developers hate it"" is not a reasonable conclusion to draw from this."

Nope. Another economic niche.

This is poor trolling. Still had a giggle.
Looks like Segwit itself was the real suicide.  Degrading the incentive balance of BTC just to fix transaction malleability, quadratic complexity issue, and give it a little capacity boost - I think that was a poor decision.  The viability of a chain is not only a function of its current state, but of its forking potential as well, which gives an nondegraded blockchain a distinct advantage.  I'm personally looking forward to L2+ solutions on top of BCH, I wouldn't be surprised to see a non-SW malleability fork to help that along.
The only Bitcoin that follows the true vision of Satoshi Nakamoto is Bitcoin Cash.

Nothing would give me more satisfaction than to watch control slip from their hands.  You know it's an unstoppable force then.  To watch their effort and money prove futile... ahhh.
"Bitcoin Cash took the simple solution to the transaction fee and backlog problem, a solution that has been proposed countless times and has always been easy to implement: increase the blocksize and go back to what Bitcoin used to be.
In the end, when you want to take $250 or $2,500 or $25,000 and send it to someone, does anyone give a shit which chain it's on? Frankly, right now, I only send Bitcoin Cash and Ethereum, because I'm not paying 5-25% in fees for the privilege of waiting 5 to 24 hours for confirmations."
"Seems like a normal market correction to me. This has happened countless times with Bitcoin in the past, but THIS ONE TIME its suicide because ot 2X. Hmm...

I'm making some profits from BCH and like both BTC and BCH (why is this reddit called BTC, btw? Seems a shady move) but I don't think one coin is the solution. I do think, though, that all this exaggerated solipsism isn't helping the community or the market. "
That summarizes it well.
What is the name of this site where you saw this chart?
"The only thing that can make this better is if they implement lukejr's 'blocksize increase' proposal to 300k. At least that way they keep their word from the HKA. ;)"
Bitcoin Cash volume is much higher than that of Bitcon at about 6 Billion...
"The two btc subreddits are very polarizing. I don't know what to believe in anymore. But I'm all in on BCH right now. :p  
 "
Seppuko
"You have got to be joking right? Bitcoin Cash is only increasing in value because of FUD and then FOMO by noobs.

Bitcoin continues to be the king. Not because it is a superior technology, but because it is stable, well tested and trusted. The main use of Bitcoin is HODL like a savings  account. If you want fast transactions, buy some litecoin or some other altcoin and use that for daily use.  "
suicide...lol. this sub is so fkn silly 
Bitcoin Cash is looking to replace Bitcoin. 
This subreddit used to be the uncensored alternative to /r/bitcoin. When Bitcoin Cash split from Bitcoin many people here support it (and favoured it vs the legacy chain, viewing BCH as the true Bitcoin), but there were also many supporters of SW2x here (myself for example). With SW2x cancelled support here shifted to almost exclusively Bitcoin Cash. So in a way the btc name is a bit outdated, but historically justified and not shady at all.
Just because someone might question your vision (or whatever) doesn't mean they are making an argument fallacy known as ad hom. In particular,  if they aren't making an argument the term doesn't apply. Gee, you learned something today.

This is what I did months ago. I have always expected bitcoin core to go down in price and bitcoin cash to go up in price until a equilibrium between the two is found. I mean it's a fork and miners now mine on both chains. They are linked together. And then I hold ETH as a backup, it's the most price stable of all alt coins and it offers a lot of things that bitcoin does not have. It's way more then just money. Ethereum is also incredibly complex so it might takes years before it reaches any potential but I think it's fundamentals are as strong as Bitcoin. I would not be surprised if the prices reaches a 1000 US within the next two years maybe even faster, who knows. As long as no more devastating bugs or hacks take place. 
Way to go! 
"Money is flowing from btc not eth. Eth is still in the same price pattern it has been in for weeks. The fight between btc and BCH has only just begun. The 2nd round fight between bitcoin(s) and eth hasn't started yet.

Personally I suspect that BCH will cut btc down significantly but will have problems overtaking it. Maybe it can split Bitcoin to 2/3 btc and 1/3 bch. Meanwhile eth (which almost took the lead earlier this year) will have an easier time taking the lead with btc and BCH splitting Bitcoin's market cap. Just watch. The flippening is coming and it will be the original flippening as it was always going to be. "
"> has very specific plans to turn Bitcoin into their person fee based business

Welcome redditor for 11 days, I'm grateful we have your expertise to assist us with assumptions!
Nope if anything it will be a stronger chain with the Difficulty Algorithm updated.
They won't change. Even if chain split occurres, it'll end fast. There's no drama between EDA and DAA like in between Bitcoin Segwit and Bitcoin Cash
Are you speaking for yourself?  Not sure how you have time to visit Reddit between counting your stacks of millions.
Typical troll shitpost. Please get better at them. 😁
"Majority of the volume is from Bithumb, a korean exchange. I'm not familiar with them but I don't think they use USDT.

Once. Especially those who did so on or shortly after August 1.

">Not necessarily — Core could just push out an update lowering the mining difficulty ahead of schedule, much the way Bitcoin Cash is about to do.

That would be suicide. Bitcoin is supposed to be decentralized and when you have a central planner deciding on the difficulty, blocksize, and fee structure it becomes something else entirely. So far the masquerade has been holding up ok but changing the difficulty would shatter it.

If you really think that would go over well then you really don't know anything about this space. No offense, but you should learn a bit more before loudly proclaiming what will happen to others. "

Wrong. But feel free to think that. Doesn’t make a difference.
"BTC does adjust difficulty every 2 weeks or so. This slows down with reduced hashrate of course. It would depend how quickly and how much hashrate BTC loses to see if the chain slows to unusable.

Then again with the currenty BTC Mempool backlog at 50% of Max Node Capacity of 300MB, it may not take too much more hash loss before the BTC chain becomes unstable.

It could be Mempool/Fee issues that cascade a BTC chain failure and migration away.

A Core Hard Fork would be the only option as others mentioned."
"Not necessarily — Core could just push out an update lowering the mining difficulty ahead of schedule, much the way Bitcoin Cash is about to do.

"On mobile so hopefully someone else can dig up actual sources, but they're not wrong. However, they did word things a bit harshly to paint Gavin in a bad light.

He didn't openly present Bitcoin to the CIA, the CIA came to him and he asked Satoshi what he thought of it, and Satoshi was never heard from again.

Pushing for big blocks, well yeah that's an obvious one and I don't see how that's a downside for anyone but Core.

He did believe CSW was Satoshi when he first made the claim. However, I understand that is no longer the case. It's almost like someone's opinion is subject to change when presented new evidence, who would've thought?"

"Not only did Bitcoin Cash already do it — they are about to do it again. For the record, I agree that BCH is the real bitcoin, but I don't let that blind me to the reality of the situation. I am not here to shill. I am here to analyse the logic and tell the truth. If you want me to shill that 'Bitcoin Core is going to die no matter what' well that's just wrong and unrealistic, so you do that, and I'll stick to a reasonable analysis of the facts. And a reasonable analysis of the facts says that Core is deeply socially entrenched in their position, and no technological distinction like 'changing the difficulty' is ever going to change that position. Hell, they could even change the proof-of-work altogether (in fact, they are planning to), and it would not hurt their social dominance at all.

The *only* thing that can destroy them is for the price to keep falling until nobody believes it will ever go up again. (And even then, they will survive if they want to, because there is a hard core of their supporters who don't care about the price.) Don't get lost in details that are not relevant to the vast majority of their followers."
They may be stupid, but I highly doubt they are stupid enough to just let their chain die when there is an obvious thing they can do to revive it. I think they waited because they're hoping they won't have to.
You are so massively in denial.

"> They'll just point to Cash and say 'They did it — why can't we.' Duh! ""No offense"", but maybe you should get clue before ""loudly"" proclaming things. (lol — is my typing too LOUD for you, Mr. SharpMud?)

You are right. Bitcoin Cash did do this. It was however the only change that they have made to the original design. They removed all the other changes that really hurts bitcoins usability. RBF, Segwit, and a crippled blocksize. It is easy to look at the two and see which one is Bitcoin and which is something that has been morphed into something else. We just proved gigabyte blocks work. This bullshit that core has been spreading has been proven to be lies and the only thing they had to hold onto is the original chain. Once they hard fork they lose the original chain and any credibility they had. With two hard forks then people must actually look at facts to determine which is bitcoin rather then blindly following the orignal chain.

> As for how it would ""go over"", where have you been?? Core has an army of cultish followers who believe anything they say. Anyone who has been paying attention knows that Core can make any change they want to the Bitcoin protocol and a very large contingent of clueless fanboys will just eat it up.

How much power does cult followers have. Can they make a non functional project work?

"I feel like you underestimate the idiocy of the Core team.  If they were smart enough to realise that, they would have done something earlier but as we can see they've already left it this late.

"It would be *no different* than what Bitcoin Cash is about to do on November 13th, so I find it *completely bizarre* that you are acting like a hard fork to adjust difficulty would somehow end 'the masquerade'.

I've no doubt that Core will do a hard-fork or whatever it takes to keep their chain from self-destructing, because that would be far more embarrassing for them than hypocrisy.
it's fungible.
But what can I buy with it?
The acceptance will follow once the precedent is set (which it already kinda is, and lot of people have already started accepting BCH, some only accepting BCH and not BTC)
Big deal 
This is the same guy who thinks Craig wright is Satoshi nakamoto. 
Man
Definitely a heavyweight endorsement. 
My gut feeling is that BTC will find a new floor between $3000 and $5000, even if there's a flippening. I think there will be two competing highly valued Bitcoins for at least a year or two. I could be wrong though. I won't be shedding any tears if the S1X blockchain just chokes and falls over this weekend, and becomes impossible to resurrect unless the entire mempool is wiped and restarted from scratch. If something like that happens, it will be big news and BTC will absolutely tank.
you should stop following these figureheads like little obedient puppies.

He didn't do very well picking the real Satoshi either...
"lol no... And Craig is Satoshi too I suppose. According to Gavin, must be true.  

Edit: I anticipate some blowback so let me just drop this bombshell of supporting evidence to back up Gavin's claims. ""Craig Wright says he is Satoshi so it must be true."""
I bought some but I'm not expecting this to last long. 
"BTC is real; the ledger exists.

BCH is real; the ledger exists.

Ian Grigg, who is orders of magnitudes smarter than you, believes it too. 
Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin.  
Need anyone say it? He thought Craig Wright, the very same scammer who runs Bitcoin Cash, was Satoshi as well. Not to mention that this dolt started the whole big block debate in the first place. 
"Nobody cares about what Gavin says anymore.

"Let's pause for a minute and digest all the news we've heard regarding BCH being the real Bitcoin from several prominent sources. The unthinkable is actually in the process of happening, folks. The king is dead... or at least dying. If *half* of what we've all read is true, then it's only a matter of months before BCH will have the majority market cap in the crypto-sphere.

Edit: thanks for the downvotes. Word to the wise, get out of BTC while you still can. I got extremely lucky and converted all my BTC to BCH before the (failed) fork. Or, you can just *hodl* until to goes to $5000, or $4000, or $2500, or $1200, or $700... you get the idea.
