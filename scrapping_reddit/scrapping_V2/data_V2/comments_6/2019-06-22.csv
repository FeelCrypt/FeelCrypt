"I also agree that anything that onboards more people to using private key encryption in day to day life is a good thing.  Even if all this is is training wheels for society, it's a good direction.  

Libracoin isn't going away.  The momentum behind this is colossal.

With the way it's structured, the whole thing could also move on without facebook."
Oh, ok, so it's just if you're into eating the wrong macronutrients that you can't use Libra, got it.
"They have no control if you don't use their fucking pos website.

">Control the language, and you control the conversation.

&#x200B;

I.e., you control people's perception of what is true versus what is a lie. So with the control of language you can pretty much get people to believe a lie as truth and view a truth as lie."
Did you know that you don't actually need to post everything on social media and still use it for its good features, like being able to contact practically anyone in a second, organize events efficiently and quickly, participate in discussions in groups?

"ahhhhh! INDEED!

YES IT IS (at least a precursor, to the) REAL BIBLICAL Mark of the Beast!

Yes. YOU ARE WISE!!!!!!!!!"

I don't have a Facebook.
Not like one of Libra Associations membership include Paypal...oh wait

Uhh... bloggers do it? Except on their own platform? I wouldn't consider most of the successful ones exactly hollow and unhappy, more like fulfilled and purpose-driven.
That, or Pisces, because these things are *really* fishy.
"Just a mild example of this though, Coinbase bans any sort of gambling-related activity even though online gambling is not illegal (except in a couple states I think). This sort of thing is just tied to their terms of service. We all know that Facebook is far less cool than Coinbase.

&#x200B;

What if they just don't like you? People laugh at this post but it's really serious - when you're not the one who's drawing the line is it even your property?"
Just my 2 cent im also a bitcoin hodler

"Why in god's name would anyone use Coinbase (or any trading platform) as a wallet of sorts?

&#x200B;

Store that crypto on a desktop/phone hot wallet or in a cold-storage wallet."
I don‚Äôt know why more people can‚Äôt see this.
"I knew this would get worse and worse. Big tech censored Alex Jones but not enough people cared because it was, well, Alex Jones.

Then they started going after all kinds of conservatives, libertarians, and pro-life Christians. But those people are on the ‚Äúwrong side of history‚Äù so who cares?

Then they started censoring classical liberals and center-left liberals as well.

Now they are going after apolitical diet, health and fitness peeps online.

Who will be next? When will people realized that if there is no free speech for one group, then there is no free speech guaranteed for any group (or individual)?"

I can't wait to see how spectacularly it fizzles
Exactly.
Reminds me of the ‚ÄúPatriot Act‚Äù and pretty much every other gov bill.
>Recently, Facebook deleted without warning or explanation the Banting7DayMealPlan user group. The group has 1.65 million users who post testimonials and other information regarding the efficacy of a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet. While the site has subsequently been reinstated (also without warning or explanation), Facebook‚Äôs action should give any serious person reason to pause, especially those of us engaged in activities contrary to prevailing opinion.
yeah I went on a poker site, lost about $40 then had Coinbase shut me out

Facebook coin -- it's for the zuckers.
"Honk memes are officially now a way to cause yourself financial ruin. We indeed do live in a clown world. 

EDIT: For those out of the loop, there was a big controversy going back where FB was banning people for typing ""honk"" in comments as it has a vague and 99.9999% of the time, unrelated reference to pepe the frog dressed as a clown often seen in alt-right shitposting. It is an example of FB trying to moral police, but ultimately looking like idiots. One of many reasons I will NEVER trust FB with my financial livelihood."
lol fb coin is a joke. Who is going to spend their satoshi for that?
People who ‚Äúlove CNN‚Äù will love this excrement token.
Yep this is exactly what's going to happen. Sell your privacy for a little convenience. We have done this throughout history  with our money. It started with checkbooks and credit cards and now it's moving in to crypto.
I can‚Äôt wait for them to do that, each time that happens they will make a die-hard crypto-fan:)
"that last bit s/b ...to learn what purchases **are** allowed.

It's all outlawed unless they permit it."
so true
That's sure, I'll give a try to libra only when there will be some alternative wallets (if they would ever be)
"Best libra conspiracy theory:  
it‚Äôs not supposed to work.  It‚Äôs supposed to just cause a regulatory shit storm that takes as much of the cryptosphere down with it as it can.

Why else would visa & Mastercard be backing it?  If they wanted to get in to crypto why the hell do it with Zuckerburg? He is not a trusted brand right now.

It‚Äôs a Trojan bunny loaded with gunpowder."
Future seems really bright.. A number of investors are ready to buy this coin.
Bro you're fucking up the circle jerk
"And to release your funds; provide a 3d scan of your body, all your identities documents, your browsing history (in XML, see button for help), your fingerprints, and a sample of your dna."
I‚Äôll start calling them Cancer or Zuckbucks
"The idiocy in here, Jesus...

This would only be an issue in Calibra (The Facebook owner and controlled custodial wallet). 

Libra on the public blockchain would likely not be subject to any TOS or ability to freeze transactions. 

The circlejerk here is ridiculous."
Wait, so in other words, I‚Äôm not going to be able to fund my favorite terrorist with this coin??  WTF?  I‚Äôm out.
"I get that this is satire, but honestly it seems nobody reads white papers here...

This sub has devolved into memes laden with flung poo."

JUST LIKE COMMIE CUCK COIN BTC HAHAHAHA"

"It's like ""Satoshi's Vision"", they always use the adjective which is the opposite of what they truly are."
I prefer zuckerbucks for the play on words.
It's a brand of tampons here in Australia i believe.
