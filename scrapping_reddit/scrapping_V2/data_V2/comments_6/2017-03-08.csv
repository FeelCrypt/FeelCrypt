That seems reasonable.  Are there other crypto currencies working this way?  I'm interested in how they're managing, since it seems there's a divide within the Bitcoin community as to whether or not a block size increase would be benefitial.
"Back in the day when blocks were not full, transactions with no fees would go through no problem. 

To solve the high fee problem we just need to adopt bitcoin unlimited or similar â€“ increase the block size to 2 MB or greater (and increasing as time and network capacity go on). 

I would say a reasonable amount to charge would be something like this:

Up to $10 is free

Up to $100 is 2-5 cent fee

Up to $10k is 25 cent fee etc"
Yes. You would have to cross-reference every object in every known colored-coin implementation against the bitcoin blockchain tx db. My guess is most of the collisions would come from counterparty, some from Factom.
So so so so cool!!! But why are the 24 hour not at 38%? Shouldn't we have hit 38% already or is it taking a while for antpool to get all their servers on bitcoin unlimited?
Sure, go for it
Interesting times indeed. I suspect a different outcome, but I'm curious to see - when we revisit this discussion in a year's time - which outcome will be proven true. :-) 
Even though a HF will be a horrible experience for Bitcoin , I want BU members to go through with it because there needs to be some clarity to this 7 year debate about the direction of bitcoin and what better way to find that clarity with a HF failing and the miners coming back to the original chain. 
"And to this guy:

"Hi, I and others would call it Bitcoin because it makes sense to call the original chain what it is and the new different chain that has different security mechanisms and rules an altcoin, but I respect your right to call it what whatever you want, and if you want to call your altcoin bitcoin as well than more power to you.

Unlikely it will come to this though as we will likely win the hashpower back when we dump the altcoin BU supporters created on exchanges. "
Do I have to explain decentralization to a chinacoiner?
"> the original coin would have 25% or less hashpower

Except that the ""original coin"" that you describe wouldn't be bitcoin. "
