Miners need to be paid.  The cost of the block reward is an internalized cost that will shift to externalized - TRANSACTION FEES.

">do not get any facts let in the way of narrative

You can do billions worth of transactions on Paypal. You don't even have to touch USD directly. None of this is shocking or new. 

Taking users off of Bitcoin's chain and diverting funds away from miners securing the chain does not help the ecosystem, unless you are a large firm/private entity providing liquidity for opening payment channels then it helps you immensely.

Of course the entities investing in Blockstream have been [disclosing this](http://www.coindesk.com/investment-bank-axa-eyeing-bitcoin-for-remittance-market/).

So have [the developers](https://medium.com/@rusty_lightning/dear-bitcoin-im-sorry-fees-will-rise-b002b1449054).

None of the fanatics seem to care that they are being told that they are not envisioned as being direct BTC consumers in the future. "

"That chart is borderline useless. Use this: https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/

The question is: how high must your fee be that the tx gets cleared eventually? That depends on the block size (or weight with Segwit txs) and the competition from other transactions with higher fees.

There's always a limit where transactions get dropped, or else tx spammers could write nonsense into the blockchain for free. So it's not useful to ask ""is the mempool full/empty""; instead ask ""are transactions for fee level X getting cleared?""

Johoe's page is great for that; you can click the fee level you're interested in, then you see how much congestion there is."
"> I don't want to open a channel with a bank. I want to be the bank.

Yeap you can do that in LN."
these are dark days when its better to hodl bolivars instead of bitcoin!! 
I'm sorry, were you mistaken that this was supposed to be a libertarian stateless currency? Didn't you read Satoshi's p2p institutional settlement whitepaper?
Why arent you using other forms of cryptos? You could create a basket of say, bch + eth + monero + litecoin that would be resonably stable and have low(er) fees? People only know about bitcoin (core) or what?
Dash has a pretty cool instant send protocol. 
I suggest going to LTC till the BTC/BCH/B** drama settles down. We have two Bitcoin chains and might have three soon. Not worth the hassle in my opinion. 
"dont forget AXA, #2 financial institution in the world. 
 "
I didn't and that's exactly what r/bitcoin said in 2013. How does the whitepaper contradict this?
no
"My life so far:

- I was born.

- I found Bitcoin in 2009 and loved it.  We got tons of merchants on board and prepared to take over the world. Bitcoin was for _spending_.

- I left Bitcoin for a while and came back last year.  People told me I was a moron and didn't know anything about what Bitcoin was about.  These people apparently joined the project ~4ish years after I did.  The people I admired had left the project.

- People now tell me to use altcoins to get the thing that we all worked so hard to have in Bitcoin. 

The real question is why Blockstream didn't co-opt an altcoin or make their own, not why *I* didn't move to an altcoin when some corporation tried to take over the project.. And the answer is that they need the Bitcoin brand for their business model. "
"Well yeah, things move fast in crypto-world. I'm definitely not saying you're wrong in your wishes for what bitcoin should be, but if core is right about anything, it's that bitcoin is the ""gold standard"" of cryptos. Even Bitcoin cash wouldn't be the cheapest way to make small transactions if it were to become the standard (ie bitcoin core fades away).

Developers and users should see low transaction costs as a target goal, miners cant or shouldn't give a fuck."
"> People now tell me to use altcoins to get the thing that we all worked so hard to have in Bitcoin.
> 

People insistent on calling BCH an altcoin are just afraid of it supplanting BTC as the true implementation (as well they should be). 



Even if they weren't, there's nothing wrong with ""alt""coins. Many of them serve different use cases and while most of them are trash, there are a few that have definite potential to settle into niches that Bitcoin/Eth/etc don't address.

> The real question is why Blockstream didn't co-opt an altcoin or make their own

Far more profit to coopt the main one, duh.


> not why I didn't move to an altcoin when some corporation tried to take over the project..

Why you and others didn't move, yes. And plenty did, and have profited from such a move. Being a responsible manager of your own money is everyone's responsibility, anyone who doesn't want to be at the whim of the world's exploiters (corrupt gov'ts/businesses/etc) anyways. "
"I have mostly come to accept Blockstream Core's takeover of Bitcoin. You're right. It is now the gold standard and that's how the world perceives it. The _reasons_ things are that way still really bother me. 

Bitcoin Cash can remain very cheap more or less forever, assuming it too is not co-opted.  The original vision of Bitcoin is to not to have a limit on block size, except to prevent spam attacks.  Technology improves in terms of price-performance every 18 months.  And yes, decentralization is important, but only to the extent that a 51% attack is very unlikely. 

Bitcoin Legacy is dominated by socialist nerds who see it as a science project, not capitalist entrepreneurs who want to grow the shit out of it. I am in the latter camp, and am now putting my energy behind Bitcoin Cash. "
Personally I'm torn between believing in the original satoshi vision of bitcoin and supporting bitcoin cash and just moving on into newer, more technically adapt coins. Bitcoin is, regardless of branch, running on borrowed time due to the technical limitations in its protocol imho. Bitcoin cash would be better as the dominant coin, but its not a silver bullet solution.
This is false and true. Depending on the hypothesis.
"Look at the time between April and July https://blockchain.info/charts/mempool-size?timespan=1year

That's too long for the mempool to not get cleared.  Imagine if bitcoin was more popular."

"Here's the link: https://blog.plan99.net/the-resolution-of-the-bitcoin-experiment-dabb30201f7

I too sold all of my BTC last year after my transactions went unconfirmed for weeks after paying huge transaction fees.  I also helped all of my relatives and friends sell their BTC that I had given to them as gifts and those transfers all took weeks to confirm. They didn't understand what was the big deal about Bitcoin and why there was so much hype because it was such a crappy user experience and didn't work.  I told them that Bitcoin was broken when the original developers were ousted by some new developers who didn't really seem to know what they were doing and made wrong choices.  Here we are one year later and things aren't any better when it comes to BTC.  It seems to be even worse.  If BTC1 or Bitcoin Cash becomes the new BTC, I will come back in."

Sounds ridiculous
"It's hilarious that you can be active enough in this space to be across this obscure argument and still think that. Of *course* trust can be replaced, happens all the time. You don't trust people's better nature, you trust their self interest, because you both exist within a construct whereby their behaviour will match pattern x *because* of that construct. 

That construct has traditionally been based on either persuasion or coercion, and market forces and money have been on the persuasion side of it, with the exception of the fiat currency debacle and the demonetisation of precious metals, attempting to put both the persuasion and coercion sides under the control of political authority. Cryptocurrencies are simply a reversion to the ancient trend of persuasion being outside the direct and total control of political authority, and the properties thereof are dictated by mathematics and cryptography, just like the properties of gold before it were dictated by stellar nucleosynthesis. 

Both forces are external to human control and thus can be relied upon as natural arbiters against counterparty defection. If you want to cheat gold as a suitable monetary item, you need to compromise stellar nucleosynthesis or similar, if you want to cheat cryptocurrencies as a suitable monetary item, you need to compromise the mathematics behind the backing cryptography. It is actually easier to do the former than the latter, because you can produce precious metals by either nuclear transmutation or particle accelerators at a far more successful rate than you could muster the necessary resources to outcompete the verification investments in cryptocurrencies."

The whole damn cryptocurrency ecosystem is pretty damn volatile. I can't wait for the bubble to burst. Whatever coins are left standing after that are the ones proven to be sound money.
It's a natural consequence of a block size limit **with no second layer option**.  This is patently obvious.  It doesn't even need explanation.

"> ... purely theoretical problems.

I think everyone who's in the BTC camp are just bitcoin minimalists who have never even looked into other crypto's and don't see how terrible bitcoin is in comparison.  Literally the only thing legacy bitcoin has going for it right now is being first to the market.
For those who value it for its scarcity only, you're probably right. It may be functionally crippled by slowness and fees, but it's still a scarce commodity, and until something else (BCC, ETH, Dash, IOTA, NEO) become as well known and usable, I think there will still be some who hold onto it / desire it for that reason only.

"**Dunning–Kruger effect**

In the field of psychology, the Dunning–Kruger effect is a cognitive bias wherein persons of low ability suffer from illusory superiority, mistakenly assessing their cognitive ability as greater than it is. The cognitive bias of illusory superiority derives from the metacognitive inability of low-ability persons to recognize their own ineptitude. Without the self-awareness of metacognition, low-ability people cannot objectively evaluate their actual competence or incompetence.

As described by social psychologists David Dunning and Justin Kruger, the cognitive bias of illusory superiority results from an internal illusion in people of low ability and from an external misperception in people of high ability; that is, ""the miscalibration of the incompetent stems from an error about the self, whereas the miscalibration of the highly competent stems from an error about others."" Hence, the corollary to the Dunning–Kruger effect indicates that persons of high ability tend to underestimate their relative competence and erroneously presume that tasks that are easy for them to perform also are easy for other people to perform.

If it happened you could point to a SW transaction in a block without a witness commitment.
The monero linking stuff was fixed quite a while ago, the transactions are no longer traceable using the current client.
If enough people request BCH, or they get enough complaints about the legacy BTC chain's fees/delays... you never know...
That is the beauty of that attack. There will be no trace. You wont even miss the witness.
LOL, a million. And in a shitcoin. How sweet. Just wait until there are at least a few hundred millions in SegWit. Then we are talking.
Please show me a transaction made without a valid witness. There's plenty of money to be made if you can.
That would be great. How exactly can we make that happen?
They'd better include all 1,000+ currently listed on conmarketcap. 
How bazaar, how bazaar. 😄
...and yet the bch price is stagnant right now, people still don't get it
Bitcoin originally derived its value from the ability to use it to trade drugs. Take that part out of the equation by raising the transaction fees to incredible heights and it ceases to have added value when compared to competing coins.
That coin is the one with all the users tho, thats why fees are high to begin with. 
"Another example:

 BitCart (Amazon gift card seller/buyer) already stopped accepting BTC months ago. They switched to Dash. They said they would start accepting BTC again once the situation would stabilize, but that moment will not be soon, if ever. (Their original reason for refusal was slow, unreliable transactions. Now the situation got worsened.)"
Yes, bcash could become as widely accepted and valuable as Litecoin!
Maybe you could persuade them to accept Dogecoin as well, and perhaps Namecoin? 
Surely open bazaar will start to be a success now that an altcoin (which lacks the ATM and localbitcoin support vital to drug marketplaces) can be used for payment!
"SegWitCoins can be stolen by the miners without leaving any trace.

I don't think that this is would you would like to happen to your users...

Seriously. Make a Bitcoin cash version. That is exactly what is needed by merchants."
Chris doesn't mince words much.
Oh yes only 150% up from like last week, very stagnant indeed. Im still not a millionair, what the shit bch!
Sure there's plenty of demand, but the supply (blocksize) is artificially restricted. 
It doesn't look to me like it's used for anything but speculation. Most of the users mock the idea of using it for anything other than speculative trading. 
Cosbycoin?
We do.
"It's alright - Litecoin has Segwit and (soon) Lightning network.

Let this compete against Bitcoin (Cash)

p.s. [bcash is not yet released](https://medium.com/@freetrade68/announcing-bcash-8b938329eaeb), don't confuse it with [Bitcoin Cash](https://www.bitcoincash.org)!"
I pledge to go on a thousand dollar shopping spree on openbazaar as soon as you enable BCC payments.
This is one of those things that it's a bit of work to do but once you do it, it usually pays off down the line. Being able to handle multiple coins opens OpenBazaar up to people who prefer other coins and also to functionality that those coins may bring that is not in Bitcoin.
He already wrote that multiple coins will be in an update that is not too far away.
So it's trivial to steal coins but a million dollars of ltc isn't worth it for you? Who cares of its dog shit if it's worth $1mm.
"I don't really get this sort of argumentation. I have spent thousands of coins with hopes of booting up the Bitcoin economy since before anyone thought much of it. It could have failed but my actions would still mean something even if it did. Same here.
"
SegWit coins can only be stolen if the chain were to revert to old rules. If that happened people's OB transactions would be the least of their worries.
I guess the 21 million coin limit is artificially restricted too?
It's a fact. No need believe or faith
It absolutely needs both. The goal is an extensible ecommerce platform. That must include users choosing the properties of the value transfer mechanism they use.
"The former would just be so much more ideal. Many vendors want to accept multiple coins and having to run a separate instance for each one is untenable.

And if we're going to go the single coin route a better implementation would really be just making it configurable on the server and client vs different forks."
We plan on doing the work, there's just other problems to tackle first. We're in the end stretch of our 2.0 release so we should have more developer bandwidth before too long.
"ROFL

Why do you think that would make any difference? Just don't believe all those BSCore lies."
No. It is actually anything but easy. That is why it will only happen when there are at least hundreds of millions at stake.
Thanks for keeping an open mind and thanks for shapeshift.
