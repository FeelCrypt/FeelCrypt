"Thanks, I'm not negotiating on anyone's behalf, there is no need to negotiate anything.  

I'm interested in the analysts of the projected PR message of various stake holders and how that impacts the trading price in dark pools and on exchanges.  

I would love to comment on your r/bitocin post but unfortunately I've been forbidden. 

let me know when the #BtcNegotiate group acknowledges that the 1MB soft fork limit is not part of the core protocol.

my position on the matter is expressed here: https://bitco.in/forum/threads/gold-collapsing-bitcoin-up.16/page-888#post-34084  

I invite you to join in an uncensored discussion on the forum linked above.

Adrian-X, your views are welcome so please join us in #BtcNegotiate (Freenode).
"oh yes I forgot to mention u/Riiume , you are only engaging with like minded individuals who repeat  the same ideas in an echo chamber. I would encourage you as a university educated person to look for information before drawing conclusions.

If you are unaware I am posting here because most of the early bitcoin adopters who hold opinions that differ from the existing hegemony are banned from partaking in this debate. 

"
"Hi u/Riiume 

I take offence at your framing of **core protocol** in the referenced comment below it shows bias and a lack of understanding.

The 1MB limit is not part of the bitcoin protocol, it is a soft fork limit introduced in 2010 - what a ridiculous stance calling it the ""core"" protocol.

> The point is, we need to find a deal that appeals to everyone and preserves the integrity of the **core** protocol.

You should try backing the bitcoin protocol not some proprietary 1MB ""core"" protocol. 

Who exactly **needs to find a deal** in a decentralized system? It would reflect more honestly if you were more direct and call it the BS/Core protocol. 
"
I'm not mad. :*
"I have a plethora of other coins I'm investing in. Everyone wants to change the world. The reason why we're in this situation is because no one can outdo Core on their following. No matter what you think about the people involved, no other Cryptocurrency has scaled to the size of Bitcoin. And while some changes might be needed, none of us know the exact consequences of implementing them. None of us have any idea at all. We've breached $1000 again by the way.

What would you do if it turned out that the very person who you think is holding back Bitcoin is actually Satoshi Nakamoto?  "
okay i forgot about that, but still there are tons of other places bitcoin discussion is made
It looks like this survey was taken a while ago, can it be conducted again?
Have you looked at it recently?  It has really come a long long way!  https://bitcoin.com
"Listen to his interviews and see for yourself how he silently ignores facts or twists them to sell his narrative.

For instance, just recently when BU clients mined an invalid block, he claimed that this was an ""orphaned"" block, which it technically is, and made it look like the only damage was only the 12.5BTC reward lost, trying to shift focus away from the fact that the BU developers have poor quality assurance. This is the kind of manipulation I am talking about. Roger is highly intelligent and charismatic and he knows exactly what he is doing.
"
And how should I have know that at that time? 
"Sorry, I had no idea the survey was old.

Still not sure how I could have known."
I made a copy, maybe you want to edit it and become the owner? Send me your google account if you want. 
I can make a copy and publish it again. Sadly I can't post in /r/bitcoin... Can you? 
"I'd like to see you as the top result when I search for Bitcoin whitepaper. In fact with ""core's"" abandonment of the whitepaper as the specification of Bitcoin I figure they'd be happy to be rid of it. 

Include the nakamoto.institue info too if you can. And could I please ask you to change the 'tab' bar tagline for /r/btc to just Bitcoin or something much shorter and concise? Thanks"
I honestly only know these two. Everything else must be pretty small.
/u/seweso was smart to not put his real name, *at the time.*
"I created the survey in march 2016. At that time Theymos had his name published everywhere (linked-in, his own websites, github, his e-mail address was his full name, his name was in his PGP key etc. etc. ). There was no way I could have know it would have been considered doxxing. 

Yet the /r/bitcoin moderators pretended I should have known somehow. I think that is inexcusable. "
I PMed you. Thanks!
You should have used one or the other, but not link the two together.
You read reddit enough to know that revealing Theymos real name is considered doxing, even though it doesn't make sense. Even Roger's account was suspended for it.
I can, and would be willing to if you published it. 
">People are corruptable. Ironically this is the factor that Bitcoin is trying to solve.

Oh, I believe it is solved. The question is...

In how much time?"
Huh? He said that he did put his real name. What am I missing?
"It was ""Real Name (Theymos)"". With no intention to Doxx, as this was public information. I just wanted a list with only real names, one alias would have stuck out as a sore thumb. It was more an OCD-like thing why I put his real name there. "
Yeah, I agree. I am not even very knowledgable in what advantages and disadvantages segwit has - but the mere fact that they silence EVERY voice criticizing core or segwit tells me enough. The censoring group is never right, because they fear people might find out that their way is the shitty way.
Yes, don't mean to whine about details, but why do you keep doing that?
When  the block size issue first flared up I really wasn't sure which view might be the best one and which to trust. But as soon as I saw the censorship and dirty tricks being perpetrated by the small blockists I knew who I wanted to throw my lot in with.
ACK
This amount of rage in honest part of community is justified one. Just remember the most important thing: they tried to ruin Bitcoin for the love of money. Hopefully it will end well and all those pricks will get amputated by hardfork soon! Cheers.
"I am still amazed that such blatant censorship problems come from a US citizen.

I thought America was very protective of free speech.."

Fuck you blockstream. Bitcoin isnt yours to take
As if he cares
https://youtu.be/igsqTkzhbvE this video is one of my favorites because they call out the person doing the bad deed.
ACK!!! ^^pew ^^pew
reddit is not the only place bitcoin discussion takes place, this subreddit is ~~horseshit~~ annoying me
Lack of principles... I have enough in bitcoin that if it succeeds I'm comfortable no amount can put a price on what I think bitcoin can achieve
Just a hint: The space only belongs AFTER punctuation marks. Like this. <---  :)
We come in peace!
Really nice vid.  Gonna share it. May the fee be with you. 
Oh sorry I didn't see his full name when I checked it yesterday. All I saw was 'theymos'. 
Bitcoin unlimited, I assume
I really don't think this was intentional in any way. Blockstream is nothing one could have foreseen. In an alternate reality without Blockstream, people might have noticed that the block size needs to increase and core would have implemented it. Could have been an easy fix.

"Yes, coreboys are common trolls, you can recognize them easily by:

they will deny the Bitcoin whitepaper is important

they will use a word, and when called out for being wrong use an archaic definition of the word to try and justify themselves as not being a liar

they will allude to problems and things but never spell them out and name call those who ask them for proof

They will post mistruths as facts even after being proven wrong 

they don't have evidence or data to support their opinions.

I think u/nullc is the best known of these 'trolls' (what else can they be defined as at this point) but there are many more. just look for people being unhelpful and afraid of facts"
What has he done? Really, because I don't see him as having done anything bad other than having shitty website
Well he also owns Bitcointalk... two VERY big places are censored that way.
"What is a theory? It's almost provable that /u/theymos is %100 responsible for this community split and people like /u/nullc do nothing to try and stop the fighting, in fact if you look at their profile they are actively encouraging such infighting. 


tl;dr there is no conspiracy, some people have done damage to the Btc ecosystem"
"An on-point flashback of /u/nullc (Blockstream CTO and actively influential Core contributor) seeking unwarranted user banning and getting /r/Bitcoin mods to dance to his tune:  

https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5j9kae/unullc_now_de_facto_rbitcoin_mod_makes_up_rules/"
I didn't see it either but I was referring to [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5roq16/dear_theymos_you_divided_the_bitcoin_community/dd9s15l/) so I assume he changed it.
