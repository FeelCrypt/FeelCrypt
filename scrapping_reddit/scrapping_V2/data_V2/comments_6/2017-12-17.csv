"That's not a conspiracy. That's how bitfinex works. It doesn't accept deposits or withdrawals in USD. You just have to send you bitcoin to an exchange that deals with fiat and then get your money out. 

Many exchanges don't deal directly in fiat because of all the regulations required and KYC laws. "
Holy fuckballs
To me that says support is largely built out.
Exactly. Coinbase knows they will make a killing. That is why they are adding a few top 10 coins in 2018.
I remember when people said that about Ethereum back when it was 1/100th the price it is now.
No, whoever had BTC on August 1st, the date of the fork. 
"Edit: Per other comments, whomever had BTC at Coinbase on August 1st.

What everyone is watching for is if BCH Trading will be active on the same date or only BCH withdrawals."
\*err
BCH won't be below 0.1 for much longer. If anyone wants BCH you better buy soon.
That would be on 2. january 2018.
Neither of those are legitimate cryptocurrencies.
well ripple sin't really a crypto
Not necessarily, they might just have that in the works after BCH support.
No, the people that had it on august 1st will get it
"The image does not indicate that they are adding separate BCH API keys or anything of the sort, nor would it make any sense to do so.

They already have a withdraw API. The image indicates that, assuming no bamboozle, they are adding a ""BCH Account"" for everyone so that they can withdraw from that (using the existing APIs)."
"A lot has changed since that post of theirs on Aug 3rd. 

Mother fucking BitPay is about to fully integrate us. 

At this point Coinbase is lagging behind a great deal. “A later date” could be tomorrow for all we know."

Could just as well include deposits
Why would they need to do that just to enable withdrawals?
They didn't integrate a full API for ETC withdrawals though?
Why would we need a withdraw api function? If they wanted to withdraw their BCH they would only have to do it once, why would they creat api for something customers are only going to use once.

Pretty sure they removed it
"I guess it's not clear for newbies.

These are developer docs, for coinbase's API. 

It's not in the coinbase front-end / app and won't be until January.

however, if you're a programmer you know this is a very strong sign that Bitcoin Cash will receive full integration and not just withdrawals."
"It's in the option screen where you create API key permissions.

edit: As per the responding comments I just checked and it is now gone but it was 100% up there last night I saw it with my own peepers.

I actually granted myself access to BCH last night, seeing if I still have access.

Edit 2: No BCH when hitting - /v2/accounts"

Thanks for this objective statement, we need to keep our heads cool
"That last sentence can be interpreted two different ways. Could be ""first we'll support withdrawals and then maybe add trading later"" or it could be ""Right now we are promising that you can withdraw your BCH by Jan 1st, but later on (from when this announcement was made) we might just add full trading support."
Been waiting almost a week for bitstamp to approve my credentials, this will save me the trouble. 
"They have existing infrastructure for BTC withdrawals, and it's probably easier to reuse that infrastructure for BCH withdrawals. API support likely comes ""for free"" when doing so."
"i've seen 3 independent confirmations of it being there.

so they likely removed it. "
They removed it. BCH and ETC were both there earlier today when I checked. Just checked 1 min ago and it's gone.
Could have been a snafu may also only be put out to some users for testing.
After Coinbase users receive BCH and the ones that want to sell, sell BCH.
It's just the Bstream Core troll narrative that price will be cheaper 2 weeks from now. Don't fall for it. 
Why the 2nd?
DASH is
"It certainly could be that they put it in place for internal testing of BCH withdrawals or something. I would be a bit disappointed if they were that sloppy about dev/prod separation, but I guess it wouldn't surprise me a ton.

EDIT: I actually think it's more likely that they are trying to silently deploy the BCH withdrawal feature in a hidden mode (until Jan), and they missed a piece."

"This means that whoever had BTC on Jan 1st will get equal amount of BCH?

">exactly what they have stated
>>We’ll make a determination at a later date

Doesn't seem like it to me."
"They run multiple versions of the API, to get the latest you have to click the ""upgrade"" button at the bottom of the API page.  Maybe they have a version in beta testing that includes BCH that hasn't been released to the public yet but is in private Beta with select users?  seems like the most likely option.  Multiple people posted the screen shot so I don't think it is a fake."
I'm not sure. Good question.
Daily limits?
"It could be that they are trying to silently deploy support for BCH withdrawals. Like perhaps everyone now has a ""BCH Account"" that is marked ""inactive"", and they filter those out in the ""Accounts"" page, but they weren't filtering them out in the ""New API Key"" area.

> Why would we need a withdraw api function? If they wanted to withdraw their BCH they would only have to do it once, why would they creat api for something customers are only going to use once.

It wouldn't be a separate withdraw API, it would use the same exact API, but with a different account (the BCH Account).

I think you are all getting carried away. I remain pessimistic for now."
/u/tippr gild
"Spot on. If all they were doing were withdrawals, then all they would need is a send tx dialog.

API keys show they are building a trading foundation. There's no reason to write a script and use an API key if all you are doing is withdrawing without some sort of depositing going on."
Why you salty?
imagine being this upset.
they removed it or it was never there (yet)
"I just checked and it's not there. You don't have to be a developer to click ""Settings""->""New API Key"". 

My guess is that either they removed it, or (more likely) OP simply used chrome dev tools etc to insert that item and manipulate the market."
not there for me either (in the New API key permissions)
It's not, though - I'm looking right at it.
"It was there! I created my api key an hour 
and a half ago. Maybe they realized taht it was being leaked and decided to take it out"
Coinbase didn't have tens of millions of dollars worth of ETC ready to be released on January 1st though, did they?  That is a huge factor in my view.
"> I would find it very strange if they offload their BCH onto their customers, and then not immediately allow them to trade those BCH on their platform.

That's exactly what they have stated they plan on doing, though. [^1](https://blog.coinbase.com/update-on-bitcoin-cash-8a67a7e8dbdf) 


> Once supported, customers will be able to withdraw bitcoin cash. We’ll make a determination at a later date about adding trading support."
Your body is a wonderland.
bcash scam coin no thanks
I got an official email saying it was only available for withdrawal at first, so don't get too excited just yet. I'm sure it's coming soon though, being the legitimate bitcoin and all. 
Charlie Lee made a comments yesterday saying anything listing on coinbase would be on GDAX first, as GDAX is where coinbase source their coins from.  He was the director of engineering so I think he would have more knowledge about coin listing than most folks.  I don't think this is indication of any immediate coinbase listing, but if you see BCH on GDAX, you buy because that means it will be on coinbase at some point.
"""This API call is a relic of the ETC withdrawals"" 

Let's see what happens. My fingers are crossed for BCH. They'd be stupid not to list it tbh."
Any news if bitpanda are moving their arse for bch support?
Haha, I have EUR en route to Coinbase right now that I was going to take to another exchange to turn into BCH. Looks like they’re about to save me a step.

"All this screenshot shows is that someone had an account named ""BCH Wallet"" in their account. You can rename your wallets to whatever you want, so this doesn't say anything in particular about API access."
Coinbase is a business, and businesses like to make money. And that money comes from your customers. And customers want to use Bitcoin Cash. Some because they hope the price will go up, others because it's the only Bitcoin that actually works like it is Bitcoin. 
We already know withdrawals are coming soon, this would be a prerequisite for API withdrawals to function.
And it's gone...

"Wow, here we go.
Last time to buy BCH cheap?"
Ok... so that's also saying that Ripple and Dash aren't going to be on Coinbase...
I'm lost on all those companies with similar names. What's Coinbase and what do they do and what they're good for? How big exactly this news is?
"Aside the fact that strictly speaking, nobody except miners and big merchants actually *need* to run a full node, a node set up on a slow, high latency home connection is practically useless to the network other than retaining a full copy of the ledger.

I run a full node as a hobby to support the cause, on a low-end VPS with 1GB shared uplink for under 50 USD per year (admittedly it was on offer, but there's plenty similar available) current network usage averaging continuous 0.078MB/s...


Rough storage requirements based on average Bitcoin Cash block size over past 30 days;
> 202.29 (kb) * 4380 (monthly blocks) / 1000 (kb) = 0.89 GB monthly storage increase

Rough bandwidth requirements based on my node's statistics rounded up to 0.08MB/s;
> 202.29 kb blocks using 0.08MB/s bandwidth = equivalent 207.4 GB monthly / 2.5 TB yearly

8000kb Bitcoin Cash blocks, based on above calculations;
> Storage = 35.04 GB monthly / 0.42 TB yearly

> Bandwidth = 3.16MB/s = 8.2 TB monthly / 98 TB yearly


For what it's worth, here's Bitcoin Core 1000kb calculations
> Storage = 1050.08 (avg block kb) * 4380 (monthly blocks) / 1000 (kb) = 4.6 GB monthly / 0.055 TB yearly

> Bandwidth = 0.42 MB/s = 1.09 TB monthly / 13 TB yearly

While admittedly these figures could vary drastically & aren't what I would call accurate (by any means), I hope this helps put things in perspective - it should be clear that combined, the advancement of technology and falling hardware/bandwidth prices (let's ignore bitcoin's price appreciation) would likely outpace the on-chain scaling requirements for the next few years, until further optimisations are implemented and/or layer 2 becomes viable. As a short term resolution (and indeed, eventually block size would need to be increased anyway) it seems a no-brainer. ...Unless you're trying to sell a product based on sidechains...

"All of the people over at r/btc bad-mouthing r/bitcoin are the **previous members of r/bitcoin** who were **banned** for thinking that it was a place that allowed for free discussion of thought.

https://www.reddit.com/r/rbitcoinbanned/"
Good luck going online to buy dollars. Sorry you missed out on bitcoin early on, and sorry you have fallen for the idea that it will happen again with BCH.
"Ha ha ha, what makes you think I missed out on bitcoin early on ? 

You make assumptions based on no facts."
You are right, it is just that most people who are so desperate for BCH to replace BTC missed out and regret it. Maybe you are different, maybe you just do it for the tips, I don't know, you are right.
"Or maybe the people who support BCH are old BTC supporters who saw the problems BTC was heading for and got frustrated with the lack of any development over the last 3 or 4 years. Maybe BCH is now more like BTC was years ago, a useable crypto currency again. Bitcoin a peer to peer electronic cash system. 

Maybe it's not the BCH supporters who are the desperate ones, seems the publicity is getting worse and worse for BTC, big names are dropping it as a payment option, mainstream media talk about high fees and unreliable transactions. While BCH gets stronger and stronger despite the ridiculous name calling on social media. 

Maybe the people with regret are the ones who got fed a narrative on a heavily censored sub and sold their BCH. 

You mentioned tips ? Is that why you comment here in /r/BTC ? You obviously don't like BCH or the people here so why comment ? Do you want me to send you a dollar ? (A USA dollar) worth ? Will that make you feel better ?"
"BCH used to be worth .55btc, now it is .09btc. BTC is hanging out at its ATH of 20,000USD.

Amazing how those paragraphs you wrote can be brought to their knees with a just a couple lines. As if I didn't just burst you bubble enough, let me just toss out the date of your impending doom, January 1, 2018 - the day when hundreds of thousands of BCH will finally be released to their owners from coinbase. Happy New Year!!!  :D"
So all you care about is $$ ? The price ?   Don't worry that the coin doesn't work any more and has zero value as a currency. It's been pumped up artificially and you unwittingly said what will happen, your bubble going to burst and when it does, and the exchanges go down and you can't sell, you are going to be sat Holding the bags, you are a sucker, a bag holder. Happy new year.

I think people are forgetting the nightmare yet to come with the lightning network as everyone gets drained of fees just to set up channels.  Also, rolling back BCH would be difficult as there are 150 GB worth of historical blocks they'd have to redo.
If they could have, they would have.

Ridiculous BS. At the moment it has 20% more capacity than normally. Next monday it will decrease by 20%."

Correct me if I'm wrong, but my understanding was that the main source of development in LTC was through porting BTC patches and improvements. And while LTC does have their own devs for support it's lacking in comparison to BTC or ETH. So if BTC development for some reason is stalled I don't see LTC's Dev team being able to beat out other alt coins to become THE BTC replacement. 
I wouldn’t say backpedal either. Perhaps “clarification” is more accurate.

"My understanding is that the pseudo-blockchain used by IOTA (the ""tangle"") is a centralized mess that requires a single arbiter to resolve divergent branches, thus making it far less robust compared to Satoshi's blockchain design.

Perhaps someone who is more knowledgeable can correct me if I'm wrong here, but so far it has been hard to get the developers or community to discuss fundamental concerns due to the Theymos-style censorship and narrative control employed by many of their communication channels, including well-documented censorship in /r/IOTA.

"Basically if you have 51% or more of the hashpower as a miner you can mine the chain any way you want, because in Bitcoin Cash like in Bitcoin, longest valid chain is what matters. 

In practice what this means is, for example you send 1 BCH to someone and in return you get something, like and entry on an exchange or a product, or credits on a gambling site. A few minutes later your transaction gets invalidated as if you never sent it. The other party can’t spend his coins received from you. You may by this time already sent yourself another coin from an exchange effectively cheating the exchange.

A worst form of 51% attack would permanently break the network by adding and removing the rogue hashrate over and over, not letting fair mining to continue. This would get worse as all fair miners leave the chain because of tanking price. 

It creates a customer service nightmare and huge uncertainty around BCH if it ever happens even once, but even without it happening people who understand the tech will be reluctant to use BCH for any medium or large value transactions. 

At any rate don’t listen to people who promote zero confirmation transactions for sure, and with anything of value wait at least 4-6 confirmations."
"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/51-attack.asp  

Note that you don't actually need 51% to attack the network like this. It just becomes more likely you will be more successful the more hash power you have. This is why hash power is so important and why BTC dominates as a store of value. It is the most secure, by far."

"Your criticism defends LN, which is cool. It doesn't address the actual problem though, which is that the base layer is intentionally limited to drive demand for LN. It's ""TCP for money"" if Comcast were the ones designing the internet. 

Let me explain this in terms of net neutrality. Comcast would very much like to remove net neutrality so they can charge more for website bundles, like they do with TV, and also push their own entertainment services.

Consider the options you have with net neutrality removed. Comcast would be able to offer unlimited Hulu (""thousands"" of movies to choose from!) streaming *for free* with all subscriptions. Netflix, and other competitors would be rate limited and you would need to pay extra to get decent enough speeds so that you can even watch movies on Netflix. When a new customer decides it's time to pick a streaming service, will they choose: a) the free one with ""thousands"" of movies to choose from, b) the one that will always cost more because Comcast effectively charges a tax to use it. Most people would choose the free one, Hulu, because **why spend money when ~~it's going up~~ you can get something for free?**

Exactly the same thing is happening with LN. Blockstream claims it will offer ""infinite"" scalability, with no fees (or very cheap fees). Other competitors to LN, such as on-chain transactions will still be around, but you'll need to pay extra to get anything confirmed in a decent enough time. When a new user decides it's time to pick a transaction type, will they choose: a) the free one that offers ""infinite"" scalability, b) the one that will always cost more because blocks are purposely kept full to create a fee market. Most people would choose the free one, LN, because **why spend money when ~~it's going up~~ you can get something for free?**

I'm sure you're aware of the marketing-speak Comcast uses to defend it's decision for getting rid of net neutrality? ""Comcast aims to support an open internet, and is committed to removing Obama-era government regulation (aka net neutrality)"". The same type of language is used to justify LN. All that talk of ""large blocks cause centralization"" isn't really backed by any research, just hypothetical arguments and censorship, and is exactly the type of marketing-speak that Comcast uses.

I'm sure LN has lots of cool features. And you're right, if LN is ever released, Bitcoin Cash probably will support it. You know what the difference will be? **Bitcoin Cash will support transaction neutrality.** 

But if you want a Comcast-like company/""open source"" project/developers in your money that ""encourages"" you to use their products, that's your choice."

The more I read up on lightning- the less I like it and the more am considering moving over to the BCH side. 
The thing is if BTC continue to be unusable for retail transactions, and mainstream adoption for retail goes to Bitcoin Cash, people will start calling it Bitcoin for short because for them the other Bitcoin won't really exist.

Back up your claims
Truf!
*facepalm*
Don’t worry. BTC only needs about 4% capacity increase to empty the mempool and bring down the transaction fees to BCH levels. And that 4% means another 10% adoption increase only. One major player adopts segwit and BTC is back in the small transaction game. And there is another 80% left in Segwit alone. We also have Shnorr, MASF on chain and Rootstock and LN off chain.
I think not. ETH already processes more transactions than BTC, but a fraction of value. LTC can be the second. Not tied to BTC in any more than any other coin. 
"Nope. BTC is indeed used for speculation, but BTC is also used for high value transactions. And in the near future it will be used again to shop for stuff again. 

BCH is only used for speculation."

"> ""Value comes from the use.""

This is actually a good talk by Andreas which indirectly calls out the brand/identity ""ownership"" message that's been pushed by our friends at Core since Bitcoin Cash's inception."

Long your mouth shut.
No, ETC has a terrible claim just like bitcoin core segwit horse shit. In both cases, ppl hardforked to get away from scoundrels.
"> Every fork is a contender in theory. Whichever fork has the most work behind it is Bitcoin. Given BTC has 1.54x more work accumulated already, it’s very hard to imagine how BCH can match and ever overtake BTC.

Easy:

All fork containing the genesis block are contender for the bitcoin name.

The difference **only one** intent to stick with the original experiment.

It is BCH,

BTC and all other are deeply changing the original properties of it.

"
The entire ecosystem and infrastructure disagrees with your entire analysis here. All merchants, exchanges, wallets, online casinos, dark markets, consumers, everyone is switching to Bitcoin Cash. Because it's actually USABLE AS A GLOBAL CURRENCY.
BCH will have the real penetration day to day and people will actually be using it in their lives. BTC at this point is just a ponzi operation. There is no real use anymore. It's just something people are buying because they think other people will buy it. Classic bubble mentality.
"> it’s very hard to imagine how BCH can match and ever overtake BTC

Not at all: Bitcoin Cash becomes more profitable to mine after majority of miners switched and retains parity after the switch, then it's a numbers game. Imagine if Novermber 12nd last EDA wouldn't kick in"

What's wrong with my pickaxe? :(
T9?
Read the title again is my only suggestion.
"He was working on stuff like PoW algos even before bitcoin. He was well known enough to get mentioned in the whitepaper. 

Seems pretty legit to me. "
Yeah how long before it's not profitable once you buy a t9 and it gets delivered?
T9 is less hashpower than S9, but consumes less electricity if I recall correctly. Electricity is dirt cheap here, so I'll stick with S9s once T9s come out.
"If all nodes decide to stop, you're left with all miners still running nodes. If all miners stop, you're fucked. 

Therefore, centralization simply refers miners, and not to node runners. If a big miner decides to flick the switch and stop the supply of hashing power to BTC or BCH, that coin dies. "
Interesting. I've thought about buying asic, but I've heard they new versions come out and make yours obsolete. Have you experienced that?
"I'm pretty sure he needs to use pools in order to mine in small scale, but he means that he has to pull out his earnings from the pool and transfer it to his personal wallet daily, so to avoid losing all his savings like what happened to NiceHash and people who used their wallets instead of a personal one.

And that procedure is probably costing him around $15 to $20 every day, because that's the average pool + miner fee to withdraw."
😂😂😂 ok
"But if you dont mine in pools, how do you get paid ? As far as i know, if you are only making $90 a day, you dont have enough hashpower to close blocks ...

Nice story bro."
You have no idea how to mine...
It's even worse on a decentralized pool like p2pool where you get the reward mined directly from the block.
do you have asic's? if so then I get your worry. If not then you shouldn't be mining bitcoin cash. There are significantly more profitable coins than bitcoin cash to mine. There are literally coins built to be mined. Do some research into them, unless you are using an ASIC machine, in which case my comments mean nothing to you.
Curious, how big is your system?
Just fyi there are a few pools that allow you to mine in a different currency to what you earn. Miningpoolhub springs to mind and I believe would let you earn whatever with auto exchange and thresholded autowithdraw of the converted currency to avoid a nicehash situation. I like to encourage people to mine btc if it's most profitable regardless of the fact I've grown to really hate it, because you're effectively dumping the difference and earning more of the actually useful currency you want from it. 
Stop spamming the blockchain with your blocks, miners!
De-centralisation refers to nodes, not just miners. I run a node. I don't mine.
This is a very real concern. I was fortunate enough to consolidate my old mining outputs from years ago for 0 fee earlier this year under the coin age priority system, presumably prior to that code being ripped out of the clients that miners were running once they went segwit on BTC.
"What is your point? ;p im ready for 1gb blocks today. Storage space is cheaper than junk food."
What you said is sort of inaccurate. It'd be more accurate to say that the person with the most capital has the highest chance of making any particular decision.
Or in litecoin.
The ability to run a node relatively easily is essential to Bitcoin, or any coin. A network can run with a small knot of mining pools, but the trust element would be weakened to the point of the coin being worthless.
Exactly and that is why a small transaction history should be sufficient. The processing power put into the confirming those transactions in the first place is enough to not fool you.
How do I verify the last 1000 blocks without the first 400,000?
I don't have to trust, I can verify the whole history myself. This is what makes Bitcoin unique in the first place.
"Why trust any confirmed transactions that happened? Why trust the entire blockchain history?  If a transaction took place and was added to the blockchain by everyone that should be the beginning and the end.

 Those confirmed transactions are all that really matters on the network. They are stamped and approved. Once approved they cannot be undone. So why do you need every transaction leading up to it? Why trust any amount of confirmations that come from miners? Sure miners need the previous transaction to make sure the incoming one is legit but why trust them? why trust the full nodes relaying them? confirmations are the trust of the entire network. The blockchain could be replaced by a algorithm.  A algorithm that determines what transactions are completely valid and no longer need a history. Say 2 week timestamp and 1000 confirmations. Just like a difficulty adjustment 

To ease your mind you could even build it so it only remembers 10 previous transactions with 1000 confirmations or more each. But you don't need it. All you really need is to make sure the current balances are confirmed and stamped."
"Yes, but how do you really know the first transactions ever made are the real deal? You don't. You have to trust that the entire blockchain you received and everyone else received from that point on is valid.
"
Because nobody can build a chain with this much PoW just to fool me.

"I agree. And while the most accumulated work is noted in the paper, I believe the context in which it was mentioned was in the case of a fork scenario which arose due to two miners appending a block in the same ""heartbeat"" so to speak... not in the context of which set of consensus rules are ""bitcoin"".

It is my belief that both are ""bitcoin"" variants. One is useful as a currency today. One is not. Perhaps that will change in time, perhaps not.

Some day POS might be useful though. Maybe.. I think Ethereum is planning to test it out soon.

It is reasonable to presume that proof of work will need to change at some point due to quantum computers. Perhaps proof of stake might be sustainable in such a world."

They split, how do you decide which one is the original? If you have a branch and cut the upper half in to, which one is the 'original' branch?
I agree with your statement it is a possibility sure, but in the end, the market and miners decide whether it's worth it. If POS makes a better world case, then sure it could take over, but I doubt it considering how much stake people have in POW
"Okay let's pretend BCH would accumulate the most proof of work at some point and then switch over to proof of stake for whatever reason.

At that point BCH would be the 'true' Bitcoin and if the fork to PoS is non-contentious it should technically hold that title, since it's still the same coin since there wasn't an actual split.

Purely hypothetical, since it's unlikely BCH would ever shift to PoS."

Yes it does, but that would result in a chain split, which is exactly what happens during a fork. So it's a very similar case.

I also agree that I'll consider both as bitcoin since they share the same genesis block. Can't say the same about obvious scam attempts like BTG or whatever happened after that.

I'm actually looking forward to the Ethereum PoS upgrade, since it'll be a good proof of concept to see if the system will work in practice.

And while quantum computers might be a problem, I'd say that's one we should try to solve once they become an actual thread and when we have a better understanding if they even pose one."
Do you think people are more likely to choose which Bitcoin to use based on whether you use all caps, or based on whether they can get their transactions through?

"For sure. But I wouldn't go so far as to say BCH is ""unlikely"" to ever switch to proof of stake. I fully expect it to be alive and well by the time quantum computers do become a threat to security... so, it may be probable in actuality.

And I am with you on BTG.. pre-mines may not have specifically been called out in the paper, but I don't think it's a far leap to suggest it is clearly counter to the spirit of the paper. I was actually expecting the BTG pre-mine to be overthrown by a larger computation power that disagreed with the pre-mine. I can't imagine the computational power behind the pre-mine was truly resistant to a 51% attack.

I suppose the fact that it didn't appear to receive a 51% attack suggests the majority of hash power preferred to mine a more profitable (somewhat synonimous with more ""real"") coin, than ""defend via attack"" the bitcoin ideologies on an arguably scam-like coin."
"Can confirm, am tiny hobby miner (<1TH), the pinnacle of decentralization; have to mine BCH instead of BTC regardless of relative profitability. Mining BTC for me means leaving my coins on pool for several months, which is just asking to be Nicehash'd. Additionally I can't move pools as easily, so this reduces miners' check on pool operators' power (via their ability to jump pools if they detect any wrongdoing by pools). 

For people claiming ""well some pools can give you your tx for free"", think again: that subsidy comes from a potential tx fee they could be collecting from users, which means it's just a freebie. Freebies don't last. "
Sure thing... For the handful that operate a pool. 
Most also warn against directly sending mined funds as well
In addition to what others have already said, I want to add one thing: Even if your pool allows you to withdraw a small amount for free, it doesn't matter, the output is still dead: because unless you move it straight to exchange (leaving the exchange to deal with the headache), you still have to move the output once more to spend it. And moving that output will still be prohibitively costly. You effectively just move the frozen fund on exchange to frozen fund in your own wallet. 
"**$25 Transaction Fees**

Antminer S9 = $2000. 

Daily revenue = $39 (block reward) + $8.5 (tx fees) = $47.5 per day.

Tx fee to withdraw from pool = $25.

To make the $25 fee only 1% of revenue $25 x 100 = $2500 in daily revenue is needed.

$2500/$47.5 = 53 S9s are needed for this.

53 x $2000 = $106,000 (min mining hardware).

**$100 Transaction Fees**

Antminer S9 = $2000. 

Daily revenue = $39 (block reward) + $34 (tx fees) = $73 per day.

Tx fee to withdraw from pool = $100.

To make $100 1% of revenue $100 x 100 = $10,000.

$10,000/$73 = 137.

137 x $2000 = $274,000 (min mining hardware).

As you see, yes, revenue increases as fees increase, but so do centralisation pressures. That also ignores that with increased revenue, comes increased hash power and then increased difficulty. So the 'benefit' of higher fees are only temporary, but the cost of paying high fees is potentially permanent."
[deleted]
So if you mine with a pool, they give you a balance on their site and offer daily withdrawal to your own address(es)
As fees increase small miners are forced to use a pool as a bank. I.e. they are forced to increase their risk. This is just going to cause a Nicehash hack situation again, but just much much bigger next time.
Basic accounting. It would make you less for that block, which means monolithic miners that do not pay out (that way) make more.
The only thing that Bitcoin Cash needs for this issue not to arise is for the network to not be constricted like Bitcoin Core. And it's not constricted, so it won't happen.
Nope, if they subsidize unwisely they can lose money. When you subsidize your tiny miner's $5 withdrawal by missing out on a $5 fee, it's just bad business.
Either your keyboard is broken or I'm getting old.
[deleted]
You're going off the deep end now. I'm going to stop wasting my time on you.
But they could mine directly to an exchange address
">Miners can just mine their own transations for free,

It will still cost them a fee, because this transactions will force them to refuse a paying transactions.

The loss will equivalent to paying a transaction fee. "
This is true, but that opportunity cost can be fairly small compared to the value of the timely confirmation of a coin. It doesn't seem like a likely scenario, but it doesn't seem impossible either.
Pool operators can also have there own transactions included in the next block, some pools allow transactions for free. If your paying 100 dollars it's probably not the right pool for you. Yes fees suck but it's temporary, and the demand is there and people are paying them. Making up a problem like this doesn't help because it's non existent. You have to do some crazy mental gymnastics to prove it to be right, which isn't the right answer.
They allow free transactions, because they  include your transaction for zero fees in the next block they mine. Effectively subsidizing the fee and passing on fees.
But surely the benefits of having your super low fee in the block outweighs the opportunity cost of the replacement? Basic accounting. 
I'm sure someone thought you were trying to be a smart-ass. 
It's just a way for them to keep miners in their pool, by including transactions you know how often they mine blocks to get it in and you don't have to over pay the fee. Having more miners in the pool is something I don't have to explain do I? The simplest answer is the right one.
owo whats this?
I don't care, because I use them as heaters. I effectively mine for free + capital cost (S3s during bear markets can be really cheap), since those are the electricity I have to pay for heating anyway.
Depends how you mine. Sometimes it's credited to your address directly other times you have an account.
< $2 a day, I hope. 
Exchanges have minimum deposit rules, if you deposit less, they do not credit your account.
That just makes the exchanges pay for it. If everyone did this the exchanges would start charging fees for small deposits as well.
The opportunity cost is exactly how much fees were left out. You could have just paid those fees and gotten in the next block. In fact, you're more likely to get it in the next block by paying the fees than to wait until you mine a block yourself.
"Have you heard of opportunity cost? Every transaction a pool includes for free on a constricted network is a paying transaction they exclude. Losing $25 by not including a paying transaction is the same as paying $25 to include your own transaction.

Also, no one is paying $100 right now for a simple transaction. I am showing what happens as transaction fees increase."
"I don't understand your sentence.

So I am a pool and include the pay out transactions to my miners in the next block with a low fee. The difference between these and the high fee transactions I have omitted comes out of my pocket. Why would I want to do that?
"
Why would a miner have to exclude a transaction to make room for his own? Oh, right. Congestion. Dammit BCH, you're spoiling me.
"You're confusing miners and mining pools. Mining pools choose the transactions, not the miners. 

Even for mining pools, a transaction isn't free. Choosing to include your own transaction (fee = 0) means that there's another transaction that you're omitting (fee = $15), so even though the direct cost may be zero, the opportunity cost is substantial."
It's good to be the miner. 
This could mean a very long wait for a small miner. You are literally waiting until your own block gets found before your transaction is confirmed... and with BTC full blocks and RBF - you really need that confirmation...
"But it does not solve the problem because a miner that does what you propose is still ""paying"" a high fee. This time instead of paying the fee directly, it pays it indirectly by leaving a high paying fee out to include its own transaction. Economically, its the same result one way or the other."
Why can't they set a low fee, and then mine the transaction in the next block that they solve?
Fake news
Smart miners usually choose to get paid less than once daily.
Why would they withdraw revenue? Bitcoin is revenue/currency
"This is backwards logic, miners make more on fees so this argument is pretty stupid, I bet he thought he was smart thinking this up.

 If your raking in massive fees per a block that more then cancels out your transaction fee costs."
It would also mean that once you had all those small payout inputs you couldn't afford to spend them.
"I can't believe I never thought of this before.

Goes hand in hand with [this article](https://medium.com/@CobraBitcoin/thoughts-on-bitcoin-as-a-settlement-layer-c40cc1415815) by cobra bitcoin (of all people)."
"People who support Bitcoin Core tries to paint Bitcoin Cash into being centralized. They usually argue that Bitcoin Cash is centralized because:

(1) External forces outside the rules of the Bitcoin protocol like patents  (Bitmains AsicBoost patent).

(2) They indirectly object to Murphys law since they believe *everyone* has to be able to have the hardware to run a node unless you want centralization, which is ludicrous. Given enough time, the price of running a full node will be cheaper as time and goes on. You could also argue that the amount of nodes doesn't necessarily correlate to centralization.

Sure, you can think that these two points are true, and to me, the first case is a legitimate claim. **But where is the math?** Here you literally have statistics (albeit crude) that correlates to mining centralization. So why cant Core supporters hand over the statistics for these 2 cases?  

Maybe the reason there doesn't seem to be so much number crunching is because they might just be hypothesises..

Great point.

"valid post by Paul Wasensteiner.
Small blocks cause more miner ""centralization"" as they say, than large blocks."
"Miners can just mine their own transations for free, if they want to. A miner that's getting a bunch of tiny payouts can just craft a low-fee (or zero fee) transaction to spend them, and just keep mining until they confirm it themselves. Miners have total control over acceptable fees, as they have the power to select transactions included in the blocks they mine.

Everyone else, though, is out of luck.

*edit* Thank you all for the informative corrections. Upvotes for everyone."

And how does pyramid^2 cash solve this problem? Is the only difference the size of the blocks? Because that would just mean that the same problems are pushed slightly down the line.

That doesn't take into account the opportunity cost of the lost revenue from mining someone else's fee.  It isn't really free (or low cost).
Mining pool owners can, individual miners can't
"It's in there best interest to subsidize the fee to keep the miners in your pool, it's not a ""freebie"" it's just smart. They still make huge profits from fees even if they are subsidized also it's basically free for a mining pool operator to include there own transactions for free."
Second that
u r valid uwu
For me, a dude who mines ~$2 a day, that time is now. 
If miners are making more in fees then the transactions fee should be almost irrelevant if not making more on there net profit. The tweet didn't account for that. Nor did he account for pool operators including there own transactions for free.
"worst possible experience.......Overstock is OverHYPED ... Overpriced ,and has the worst customer service ever they can not even follow their own refund policy.... Fail my .71790291 LTC transaction dumped it into btc on coinbase worst possible place since, I dont trust coinbase with my info.. I wouldn't support OVERSTOCK in anything they do.. they also need to respond to the BBB complaint, Consumer protections, and I assume the the State Attn general's office will take more time to process
