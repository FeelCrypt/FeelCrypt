This has been happening for ages... here's 4 videos from as long as ~5 years ago: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PStpvviPgxk&list=PLHTDmkg9apDz2qyZ6nqhCZC5cBx7SdkJi
"It's been an ongoing battle by the media to discredit social media with the fake news narrative that has been going on.

Face it, the 2016 election and the hacked emails revealed the systemic corruption by the political insiders and the media to manipulate public opinion. It put tremendous damage on the establishment and the media. The fake news and Russian collusion narrative are the media and the establishment fighting back to regain its control.

Social media has done a net good for politics, by far.

Does social media have its issues? Sure. But the alternative is far worse. Before online social platforms existed, people passively consumed information from a few select sources on television. And it's often tailored to the lowest common denominator. Television treats politics as if it's some reality-show-sports-game, focusing on poll numbers and scandals. The actual issues and policies are pushed to the wayside. If you wanted to do research on your own, you had to go to the library and ask the librarian to dig through cabinets of catalogs to find the information you wanted.

The internet has vastly expanded the political discourse. Yes, that means there is an increase of bad information. But the flip side is also true. People can do research now on unprecedented levels. You could quickly look up facts to confirm it. You could quickly look up a candidate's voting record. The average person could engage in politics instead of just listening to a few pundits on the screen.

The result is that people who engage online have vastly different political views than the ones pushed by the television news outlets. The older generation grew up getting their news from television and they continue to rely on it as their primary news source. The median age of the CNN viewer is 60. Fox and MSNBC is 65. 

And you could see a stark divide in their political opinions compared to those younger than 35. The younger, more engaged generation prefer candidates that speak with substance. It's not surprising when the candidates that are popular on the internet are very different than the ones covered on television. Bernie Sanders had a media blackout yet he is overwhelmingly popular with those younger than 35. 

What's going to happen when the older generation passes away? The establishment will lose their control of public opinion through the corporate media. They will not go without a fight. "
Great video. u/chaintip
The crazy thing is a lot of these anchors have no real choice but to recite this garbage. If they are under contract (most would be) they have to do what they are told or they could be ruined financially and professionally for life. More than just a lost job but lawsuits and more. 
This video is probably more relevant to Bitcoin than anything on any crypto sub. This shows how a few people in places like 'media matters' are feeding the talking points to these local stations on both left and right side of the political spectrum, who are just parroting the talking points. This clearly lays out how the powers to be, use their control of mainstream media to push for bigger government, more war, more debt and more inflation through central banking cartels who will reward back the media and politicians. Its a vicious cycle where a handful of kleptocrats are able to control the population. Bitcoin breaks that if it scales adequately to become money for the masses and snatches back the control of money away from the establishment powers.  BCH is that bitcoin.

"You sir, are entitled to your own opinion. I would suggest you do some more research on BCH if you believe the sole difference* in comparison to BTC is only the blocksize.

* I use the word difference because advantage is subjective.

I honestly believe in the best of both worlds. I don‚Äôt think blocksize is the sole answer to scalability, nor do I believe off-chain layers are the sole answer. I think a combination of both will have to do the job, in which I think both BCH and BTC communities can agree with. The two communities just differ on the implementation of doing so. Which is perfectly fine in a free world. 

Moving into the future, it will be interesting to see the different outcomes with adoption on both platforms."

"So... and this is a serious question... does r/bitcoin genuinely believe that businesses will opt to pay high fees and manage lightning channels and do all kinds of other hassles... rather than just using another coin?

I get that Bitcoin wants to not sacrifice security and genuinely believes any blocksize raise will harm security.  Ok fine, so it really is ""digital gold"". You can't really spend it or use it, but by god it's the most secure coin.   That's great, good for you.  But surely you're not convincing yourselves that people are every going to *use* it for anything besides ""hodling""?

I mean, be honest, do you actually *use* Bitcoin like you used to?  I used to buy stuff with Bitcoin.  You know, support the coin, promote its use, etc.  I can't do that any more without massive headaches or fees.  It's become *harder* to use over time, not easier.  I can no longer promote it as a solution for the poor and unbanked, for easy small internet payments, for.... anything other than being secure digital gold.  And again, I get it, that's a solid use case.  Keeping your money secure is important.  But you do understand why most people are using other coins, right?  You do understand why your own devs are telling you to use Litecoin if you want to actually pay for stuff, right?

"Well actually, I should have not made that statement as I am not as familiar with the technical aspects of LN to make such a statement. 

However, if you want to talk about potential, BCH is also planning another blocksize increase to 32 Mb.

If LN is implemented as intended, it does have the potential to blow that out of the water though. Like I said only time will tell, plus these aren‚Äôt the only scaling solutions for either party.

I will say that, in comparison to LN, BCH can provide transactions comparable in speed and fees (cheaper?)  on its L1."

"If you read again, I did make a pro BTC point about LN scaling if implemented as planned.

I‚Äôm not ‚Äòshilling‚Äô any coin, I call it how I see it, a spade is a spade.

I invite you to explain your ‚ÄòChinese scam coin‚Äô narrative without using bcash/roger/jihan as supporting evidence because the whole‚Äù[insert roger/jihan/CSW here] did [xyz] so bcash is a scam‚Äù is an invalid argument that has nothing to do with the coding of the Bitcoin Cash protocol.

You do realize that as of right now, Chinese scam coin can perform just-as-fast transactions (even micro-transactions) with sub-cent fees on chain, when compared to LN. Also, with LN you cannot gift someone with cryptocurrency who has yet to adopt the technology.

Also with LN, the majority of fees will be removed from the miners and into LN, this is detrimental to the very foundation of the protocol.

I‚Äôve said it before, I don‚Äôt have a problem with people having their own opinions nor do I have an issue with BTC implementing their version of the Bitcoin protocol.

‚ÄúIf you don't believe me or don't get it, I don't have time to try to convince you, sorry‚Äù - SN.

Edit: another user had pointed out that the way you can lose your funds if you broadcast an old channel state within LN, this gives economic incentive for the collectors of such funds to promote fraud for their own gain. There is no such incentive with BCH in any way shape or form."

"Do you really need this bot to tell you someone whose comment is:

> btrash

is an /r\/Bitcoin troll?

#Really??"
It's easy to have an army of fake accounts to press subscribe. It's a lot harder to create genuine post and comment activity
What else is the difference besides blocksize
hahahah, yeah I'm always hesitant to force a redpill on someone who's completely unconscious. I assume most folks in r/cryptocurrency are bandwagon jumpers who excited about the fad but unaware of it's deep anti-establishment roots.
You don‚Äôt understand consensus, do ya Champ. 
Well I just upvoted you despite feeling negatively about it. 
I didn't agree that it's immoral. I said it's the nature of mass media.  Especially in a free society.  
this is what you call an answer? more like trolling to me.
"> I am not as familiar with the technical aspects of LN

classic indoctrinated bcash shill.

well, if u were, you shouldnt shill that chinese scam coin anyway.

Can't be sure, but I don't think you need anti-BCH bots at this point, the useful idiots can carry the message themselves
No. What you have there is not evidence btc has been taken over by bilderberg. What you have os proof that there are ties from AXA to bilderberg, and from AXA strategic ventures to blockstream. All the fluff you add to these facts are whats called a conspiracy.
I'm starting to think fighting it is playing into their hands more than just letting it roll of our backs. If it makes it impossible to have a conversation then we will never gain ground with ppl who still have an open mind. 
Lol and it has positive upvotes. 
"This is exactly what I mean, thank you for being a good (toxic) example.

I am entitled to have an opinion, just like you, its a free world, but you call me a tool for having a different opinion than you. 

I tell you why people like me dont like BCH and dont want to support the coin by holding or buying it. Its purely because of people like Roger Ver and fake satoshi. (ex) criminals, proven liars, paying people to shill, faking newbies into believing that BCH is bitcoin  by abusing the bitcoin.com domain, a btc subreddit and the bitcoin twitter. I am not making this up, these are facts.

Would BCH ever be so big without the support of Roger and the channels he controls? 

Also this sub, so toxic. You guys want bitcoin to die, why would you think that anyone who likes bitcoin would support you guys? Why do you think you can win love and support by doing all those things? How did you ever think this would play out?

The truth is that bch probably will never succeed because of these reasons, we, the **majority** in the cryptocommunity, dislike bch because of this. You dont have to like it, I just want to inform you why people are hostile against bch, its because you are hostile to anyone else who doesn't favor bigger blocks, more centralization, less security etc.

You are entitled on having an opinion about what you think is bitcoin, again its a free world, but I am not a tool for disliking it, I even explain to you why I dislike it. 


Bitcoin does not has such dominant frontmen as BCH, of course there is core, most guys are very cool, some a bit less. Of course there are people like Andreas Antonopoulos who are the face of bitcoin. But its been a while now, most people have choosen what they like most, and you guys just ruined it for people like me who had an interest in both coins, but now only hold the real bitcoin because of people like Roger Ver, fake satoshi, and people like you. 

Why do you think we (the majority) dislike bch? because we are all stupid? 
"
Btrash..
Proof that the BCH brand is toxic.
everybody is using bcash.... 20 tx per block
"Dude, wake up. Shittly Bitcoin copies that don't innovate that much compared to Bitcoin have no future, especially since Bitcoin itself has no future.

If you want to take part in the cryptocurrency revolution, move your funds into Stellar, Ethereum, Nano, etc."
Yep, people would love Bcash if it wasn't a centralized 8hitcoin.
Yeah I‚Äôm pretty sure this is the case because from what I‚Äôve seen in the sub, BCH sentiment is neutral to positive. A CoreCoiner went on a rant about a month ago basically just shittalking Ver, using logical fallacies and downplaying the actual tech. The post got upvoted through the roof, but the comments told a completely different story. The mods eventually deleted the post and possibly banned the OP.
We should try posting positive news about BCH using the bcash keyword. See whether it gets massive upvotes.
"  IF Bcash is so good  and ""about to over take Bitcoin""   WHY  It  only has a bout  5 %  of BTC  daily volume ??  Constantly  ? You can have  supper cheap  tx prices if no one is using it.     Save your  all the alts  are town   BCH is  suppoused  to  be the   true vision   so why is it not taking off ?. Lets not forget that  over 70%  BCH ATH volume game from one Korean exchnage.   BCH  has  crashed    from  .28(~0,5  at ATH) against  BTC to 0.09 against btc   from  ca 3000 usd to 680usd .  
Yes  BCH is about to  overtake  Bitcoin ."
Hmm why not put both
The problem is newcomers first crpto subreddit tends to be r/bitcoin
Have you asked yourself why people might not like bcash outside of this sub?
"Never? Only core people? Strong statement. Look arround in this topic and sub how people respond to people like me which explain why BCH is disliked. 

Your posthistory:
>Down voted your comment for stupidity. No hard feelings.


>I have never heard of the conspiracy theory that people are trying to hide the existence of this sub. Thus, your comment and your doubling down on your non-argument are stupid.


Looking at your post history you are not the worst, but you seem to like to call people stupid of having another opinion, that is kind of toxic myfriend.

I dont really care though, its a free world and you have the right to have your own opinion.

Can you have cryptocurrency on a 2G feature phone without it being a custodial account? 
yeah, don't keep your life savings on cointext
What has been your alternative since the beginning?
Make Bitcoin Cash again.
No need for bots and conspiracies, this is how reddit and hiveminds work
ah yes, just let everyone talk trash about your project and pretend it doesn't matter
No one hates the technical aspects of BCH, but most hate the aggressive and toxic behavior of your frontmen en most supporters. Its just the wrong aproach to keep screaming that bch is the real bitcoin. Its not and most people will dislike bch for it.
Its probably too late.  Perhaps BCH needs to rebrand to escape the toxic contamination of the brand?
"And if you look at the thread over there, lots of rCryptocurrency people are actually interested in the technology & business idea.  

Someone even sent me some dogecoin from their doge version of tippr. 

If people can shed their rBitcoin brainwashing, and keep an open mind, they'll see that BCH has a lot of great stuff going on."
"yes I saw it and upvoted immediately. 
"
[removed]
Damn that is smart. 
"The glaring issue with cointext? Everyone basically have your seed! It's in the phone directory!

Now, the algorithm to derive the key from it is secret...

Honestly speaking, this means that cointext have all the private keys if they log the phone numbers that create wallets. It's basically the same as custodial with 2FA, except if the algorithm to generate keys from the phone numbers leak....then it's far worse."
Great work! Keep up the nice fight 
Is that ‚Äúproof‚Äù though? 
Yep, elderly people sending crypto on their Nokia 3310 is the killer use case we‚Äôve all been waiting for 
Yeah it's pretty ridiculous. I try to spread some knowledge over there when I can. I encourage everyone else to do the same. Normies need to get taught what BCH actually is. I have no doubt it is heavily bridaged by /r/bitcoin
Buttcoin also loved your post
We're going to FORCE them to like us whether they want it or not! Our opinion is much better than theirs. 
"I've been saying since the beginning that ""Bitcoin Cash"" was terrible marketing. 

"
It's not just bch it's every issue. The older I get the harder it is to live in the world.
The name is the only thing holding you back.
If you believe in the project so much, you shouldn't be worried about bots or what /r/cryptocurrency or /r/bitcoin thinks...
Proof? No. Just evidence that you used to draw your own conclusions from.
"Great. We all need to be spreading the positive news about the massive strides BCH is making in this places like rCryptoCurrrency. 

We need to do so without attacking Core or the intelligence of those who would belittle our progress. Even if it means getting buried in downvotes. 

Commenting and discussing our position in a calm and humble way is paramount. That is how we win supporters. Not by name calling. By trying to show them your view point, and trying to see theirs as well. "
"If you do some reading in that sub, you will see that BCH receives a lot of hate. I too, found it interesting that this post was trending with positive feedback.

I have also seen other posts similar to this one in which the user replaces ‚Äúbitcoin cash‚Äù with ‚Äúbcash‚Äù and usernames immediately flock to upvote and comment.

I believe there may be some truth to this post. "
My rCryptocurrency thread already has 5,000+ views, from a crowd that normally never sees pro-BCH info hit their front page.
Rebranding may not be enough. Ver's underhanded tactics and his revenge approach to promoting BCH have attracted a lot of like-minded people to the BCH community, and now the community itself is polluted.
"Nobody likes bcash outside of this sub. That's what you have to live with. Keep attacking other cyptos and you'll just get more hate. Get on with it.

I may upvote some bcash news btw. Bcash is a good guy. Also post some Roger Ver is a scammer news. You will get shitloads of upvotes."
It is just too easy to write bots to manipulate Reddit.. I doubt they are not bots out there against BCH.
Sorry to bring up this conspiracy again, but it's actually very real. Nothing weird about bots in social media at all.
The toxic contamination you're referring to is propaganda. It doesn't matter what we branded as, there would have been a narrative spun around it to make it appear like a scam.
"""Bcash"" is a slur used by the [rBitcoin cult](https://i.redd.it/n3bb9zgywmk01.jpg) which uses [censorship](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7x5rgp/flashback_i_just_unsubscribed_rbitcoin_and/), [personal attacks](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/83glyd/rbitcoin_crybaby_cult_explodes_with_salty_tears/), and [spam bots](https://i.redd.it/ysx8w88gowe01.jpg)."

"Bcash is better, but I'm sure there is something better than that.
"
bitmain cash
Yes, if its a GOOD project this is exactly true.
"Maybe because it's vastly overhyped and doesn't
have any advantage over btc other than block size? Block size is a drop in the ocean, good on btc for focusing on more scalable solutions that actually can make a change, i.e. lightning. "
"My point stands that evidence != proof. He drew his own conclusion from the evidence and presented it as proof. That is disingenuous imo.

Im not debating btc vs bch politics and which subs hate who."
the only pollution here are trolls like you
"Probably not.

Cointext is probably fine, but it *is* a bit overhyped. And totally custodial even if they try to pretend it's not"

/r/CryptoCurrency is by far the largest crypto sub, 9k posts and 155k comments in the last 30 days vs 80k comments and 4k posts on /r/Bitcoin 
Ah.. a tinfoiler. You'll make this community proud
I have never seen toxic behavior from bch supporters, only core people.

"you must be willing to be a used as a tool, if you really want to consider basing your sympathy over bitcoincash frontmen or the coin itself on the crap you mentioned. 

did you sleep under a rock the last years? you think everything was hunky dory and everybody was on the love train, until some meany  like roger Ver startet yelling at people and flipping them off? Because they just asked politeley, why he left them and went to bitcoin cash? is this the type of naive worldview you are having?  

""oh i've seen a video of roger ver flipping off a little turd, bcash must be a scam!"" 

look at the psyches running bitcoin core and please tell me, its because of ""mean frontmen"". just wittness the endless trolling comments from all the people who cant shut up screaming ""bcash bcash bcash"" even on absolutely unrelated posts of bch people?"
"They are hard to find but there are studies about a growing segment of the population that are developing a mental ""allergic reaction"" to propaganda.

What this is doing in the long term is costing the manipulators money, while devaluing reddit at the same time, racking up more and more diminishing returns, while triggering the Streisand effect more and more often.

All according to plan. MUHAHAHAHA. Sorry, am mad scientist, I get carried away."
I dont know much about the Brazilian Payment System but, Bch does not use centralized lightning hubs nor is it centralized in any way. Source: https://www.bitcoin.com/guides/bitcoin-white-paper-beginner-guide

I agree, it's an appropriation. It's worked exceedingly well for oppressed minorities. It takes the linguistic weapon away. I've always said bitcoin is broken we should be done with bitcoin and Be Cash

Hmm I am wondering why this corporate bcash coin is falling and falling
