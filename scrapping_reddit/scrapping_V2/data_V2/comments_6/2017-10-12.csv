I like what Steemit is trying to do, I just don't think their service is up to par with the likes of Reddit.
I meant no offense, even if your inclusion was an off-hand remark.
"T_D believing in free speech? Right. Only when it benefits them...  
I've posted one link in T_D, about Trump-related news. Sure, it wasn't painting him in the most positive view, but that's what free speech is about, right?  
Sure enough, it got downvoted to oblivion, so I gave up, but the thing is, months later, I received a message informing me that I was banned there.  That was my only T_D-related activity ever. Free speech my ass."
"> And I can guarantee you that every subscriber of T_D believes in free speech and would be very much against the censorship of /r/Bitcoin.

What? I couldn't make that guarantee of any subreddit unless the subreddit was empty. I find that claim very unlikely."
"Yeah cause it's full of BOTS and paid RUSSIAN AGENTS and a few wackos. Because their bots were memeing and ruining reddit for everyone. If you are a Trumpster and you support Bitcoin Cash thanks for letting me and everyone know.

Edit: you are naive. T_d is against free speech and has banned more accounts than ANY OTHER SUBREDDIT. gosh as naive about T_d as bcash"
"I don't know if this is a joke or what.  I've been banned from /r/The_Donald  myself.  It's ranked in my mind next to child porn .onion sites under ""biggest cesspools on the entire internet.""  It's a subreddit full of brainwashed fascists who use groupthink to make up for male insecurities, and it sounds from your comment like you're one of them.  And before you even say it, I'm no Democrat, I'm no CNN watcher, I'm no fan of any politician the word ""politician"" even applies to, and the only axe I have to grind is against people who commit crimes against humanity."

By trolling do you mean calling out wildly unfounded conspiracy theories? I may have posted a snarky remark or two (I called BCH BCASH once, the horror) but relentless trolling seems like an easy way to write off any dissenting opinions.

Just like the entire anti-NYA movement on twitter is toxic trolls, am I right?"
"By 'those types of people' you mean... /r/bitcoin moderators...? Or reddit admins...?

No, I'm not an ist of any kind."

He's right. I was banned from Bitcoin for asking questions about Bitcoin cash and segwit.2x.  if you stray from Bitcoin narrative your comments get censorred and if you call them out on it they fucking ban you. R/Bitcoin is trash.
I went through your post history and saw the 9/11 video. That's at least one thing we can agree upon. There's too many discrepancies that the government has willingly ignored.

Actually I wasn't even referring to his theory.  I was just making a comment about the other sub based on things I've seen, firsthand.  

So.... plenty of facts to draw from. 

As for them possibly reporting the ads:  Dont play stupid dude.

They've done literally everything else in the book.  You're going to pretend they wouldn't do this?  "

Why would you even think you'd get banned on /r/bitcoin?  I've seen you trolling this sub like a motherfucker today and you've gathered tons of downvotes for nearly everything you've said.  If anything, you'll be praised and given a medal of honor over there.  

>with my ""Core shilling"" attitude I'll probably sooner get banned here.

No you won't.  Over here, you'll continue to be allowed to express your opinion without getting banned.  And you'll still probably never realize why that's evidence of something important."
Oh, I see, I think you're wrong.
don't bother. possible real world troll. you should have noticed that when he said T_D believes in free speech and anti censoring. it's the most censored sub on reddit, that's why I can't even take this guy seriously re anything.
"The cringiest thing I ever saw was his testimony in front of the NYDFS, where several times Lawsky would say ""Bitcoin"" and Charlie Lee would correct him ""... or Litecoin""."
My opinion of you is likewise. T_D is a cesspool of garbage and I'm sure you are going to do your best to make that of this sub. TIL is that there is an overlap between T_d and this sub. Good to know 
A few days ago he said it's ok if bitcoin is crippled, LTC can pick up the slack.
">Edit: O I get it you're here to likely pawn off some illegal stuff for non reversible currency

Oh, no, go right ahead.  Although you sound busy, we can pick this up later if you want.  How does next week look for you?
Fair enough, let's say 90%.
This is one of the stupidest comments I've ever read. Thank you for confirming my suspicion that you are just a very impressionable average joe, with no critical thinking skills.
Says a T_D alt righter, almost everyone in the world is begging likewise 
The Russian narrative has been dropped for a while now. Please report to CNN to receive your new orders.
"I don't think 90% of America believes in free speech. I think you can get 90% to say they do, but when pushed on an issue like they will show their actual beliefs. Ask the average person whether or not Nazi's or KKK members should be allowed to hold rallies or protest and see what they say.

I understand that those two questions may not work with the Donald, but I am sure with some more time I could think of a few that would. I think 60% would be more accurate."
don't bother. honestly I don't think B Cash would want to associate with him and if the community does, it tells you all you need to know.
"Great evidence, it was clearly /r/Bitcoin - they must have compromised reddit entirely!

On a serious note I've been here for more than 3 years and believe it or not I'm still unbanned on r/bitcoin - with my ""Core shilling"" attitude I'll probably sooner get banned here.

I'm not gonna condone their moderation but there has been an endless sea of intentionally misleading concern-trolling shitposts about fees and a bunch of legitimate, non-trolling users got caught up in that. 

It's a shame but at the end of the day it has nothing to do with what is and what isn't a good approach to scaling an $80B decentralized network. "

/r/The_Donald is a sub meant to be a 24/7 rally. It openly admits:

>Be advised this forum is for serious supporters of President Trump. We have discussions, memes, AMAs, and more. We are not politically correct. Please read and respect our rules below before contributing.

You are not supposed to post if you don't support Trump. This is not censorship, this is just the function of the sub. They also have a separate subreddit for non supporters to debate and ask questions.

>It's a subreddit full of brainwashed fascists

Brainwashed? Like thinking Hillary Clinton deserves to be locked up for deleting 30,000 emails from her personal server, after receiving a congressional subpoena to release them? Fascists? Are we fascists because we love America? Or because we believe in the right to bear arms?

I've met a lot of people like you. You're quite happy to say stupid shit like "" It's ranked in my mind next to child porn"" or ""brainwashed fascists"", but you're incapable of actually participating in real discussion."

"Reddit is pro-censorship and doesn’t want anyone to realize the extent to which opinions are suppressed on the site.

Calling attention to r/btc highlights the deficiency of the preeminent bitcoin subreddit resulting from reddit’s censor-oriented design.

Calling it a security is simply an excuse.  Advertising a less censored alternative to a big subreddit is not something reddit is going to ever allow because it brings truth to the most pervasive myth on the site."

"Stop spamming. r/btc is not ""half of the story"", it's just less than 1% of the story. A story of people duped by Roger ver to support the bcash altcoin."

I think Reddit owners are pro-1MB.
"I know I'll get called a statist shill for this, but I've come to believe that companies which monetize social interaction (Reddit, Facebook, etc) should be tightly regulated.

Ideally it would be decentralized and non-profit.   Censorship in such forums is a violation of free speech rights."
"Thank god for the reddit admins, saving countless users from losing money with bcash.

"Not at all. The users and developers were broadly in favor of SW (even if this sub weren't) so naturally there were little contention.

The 2X part is highly contentious and it is also a hard fork so going against the users will, will leave the miners and supporting businesses on an altcoin."
"That's a good approach. 

Holding onto your BTC until you have a better understanding or the market makes it clear what's what is the way to go for sure."
Their goal is to make people think BCH is dying.  So they say it's not just fork preparation.   
"Great! 

The industry is built on the fees of users like me. If a majority don't support the actions of these ""blacklisted"" companies than we will find and support companies that do. Ultimately profit incentive always aligns suppliers with the demand. "
"If you believe in BCH and the price is low, that could be a good time to buy in. If you think the price is low and that scares you, you're probably not that confident in the coin itself.

Personally, I'm just holding everything. It may not be the optimal strategy but I think it offers close to the best risk/reward option cause I'm not really confident in my opinion of how any of this turns out (too many variables and entities that don't stick to their guns)"
"The curve being what it is today, there would be no better time to buy BCH if you really believe it's going to rebound after whatever happens with BTC in the near-term. The profit margin looming out there (in theory) is much larger for BCH than BTC.

">Opposite picture? How many people have you seen here trying to find buyers for their BTC trying to buy B2X coins? Lol, none. Literally anyone would jump on that offer. 

That's not the point. You're looking at it backwards. People are cashing in all of their alt coins to get more BTC for the forks. It's a rational, intelligent move when nobody knows what will ultimately last long term. 

They will go right back to their previous holdings after the forks. So all of this mutual masturbation going on about BTC organically rising is bullshit. It's incredible the denial people have to ignore the timing of this.

>Might want to wake up and realize 80% of the industry has bailed from your implementation of bitcoin. Your blacklist of companies is getting longer and longer. Have you noticed that?

Funny you chose 80%, that's what it's looking like will be the value of the legacy chain if S2X doesn't implode before november. Actually we just broke .2 for the first time on the BT2 futures, ouch. The businesses supporting NYA will get a healthy reminder that they do not control Bitcoin. Then they will get back to making a lot of money being players in the Bitcoin ecosystem. They can't afford the conviction of Bitcoin holders, bills to pay etc.

with the addition of segregated witness into the code I think that 'takeover' has in part already happened. 
I see it as the completion of a successful takeover and it is the time to abandon BTC forever. Either teams other than Core can make changes or Bitcoin is entirely controlled by a single team. It is the most centralized aspect of Bitcoin.
I don't understand it well enough to make an accurate prediction. I'll just have to wait to see what happens.

The only exception to my prediction is if one of the new forked coins becomes more popular than BCH.  

But your hope that BCH is currently dying is silly.  We are 2 weeks away from a major fork where people will get ""free money"" if they buy lots of bitcoin.  

Not surprisingly, the Bitcoin price is rising and BCH and ALTS are all dropping.   This is just basic common sense.  I myself cashed out 100% of my BCH temporarily, to buy BTC last week.  I know many others who are doing the same.  We are all converting back after the forks."

It's not 2 months old though. Is Segwit 2 months old? No, it comes with a value from both being legacy bitcoin, but when they split, they are decoupled from legacy bitcoin and allowed to stand on their own. The market prefers the two month old segwit coin over the two month old BCH coin. It's really that simple... I understand people on this sub accuse the other sub of trying to destroy bitcoin but thats really not the case, we're trying to make it successful we just disagree on how. I'm sorry you disagree with the market right now, but I truly believe the direction that BTC is on is better than BCH.

If you try to trace back how was your opinion about Putin and Browder formed, you will see that it is based on news outlets, and not just that, but that all of them were biased in the same way. I can bet that there is very little independent research you did on your own, e.g. by spending months and years in Russia talking with relevant people and forming your own opinion. I am not criticizing you personally, we all do it all the time, it's a good exercise to try and become aware of that.

"In years of search, I couldn't find any.

RT started ok-ish, but they became biased in the other direction. There is no outlet that gives equally good representation of opposing facts; note I use ""facts"" and not ""opinions"", because the main mechanism by which media outlets express their bias is hiding relevant facts and emphasizing others. They also straight out lie, but relatively rarely; it's good enough to selectively choose facts.

The best is to do independent research, but you can only do that in very narrow domains. And this is exploited by the media, because each of us can do our own independent research and get closer to the truth in one narrow domain, so they are free to feed us misinformation for all the other domains.

The way I personally try to fight this, and I encourage others to do the same, is to be aware of when I am parroting something I heard in the news (as GloriousImperfection is doing here, no offense, it's just an example) vs. when I am talking about something I experienced 1st hand over extended periods.

"**Appeal to ridicule**

Appeal to ridicule (also called appeal to mockery, ab absurdo, or the horse laugh), is an informal fallacy which presents an opponent's argument as absurd, ridiculous, or humorous, and therefore not worth consideration.

Appeal to ridicule is often found in the form of comparing a nuanced circumstance or argument to a laughably commonplace occurrence or to some other irrelevancy on the basis of comedic timing, wordplay, or making an opponent and their argument the object of a joke. This is a rhetorical tactic that mocks an opponent's argument or standpoint, attempting to inspire an emotional reaction (making it a type of appeal to emotion) in the audience and to highlight any counter-intuitive aspects of that argument, making it appear foolish and contrary to common sense. This is typically done by making a mockery of the argument's foundation that represents it in an uncharitable and oversimplified way.

Your persperctive seems rather limited if you form such a strong opinion after 2 months.
"> 80% of the industry supports my implementation when you look at the market share of the other two bitcoins

I base ""support"" .... on the # of users who are influenced by the major players in the industry.  For example:  Coinbase makes decisions for easily 80% of the entire userbase.  Hundreds of thousands of new users every week.  I dare say BitPay controls 95% of the merchant space.  They are the largest merchant processor in Bitcoin, with tens of thousands of merchants under their wings.  

***And you guys just blacklisted both of them.*** 

That's only two companies.  There were another 30 on that list.  And you've still got the large # of miners who have publicly stated they do not support Core.    Those numbers don't come even close to matching your statement that ""80% supports Core"".  Maybe we determine influence differently.  I strongly feel that if you burn bridges with the biggest players in the industry, you are playing with fire.  And I strongly believe if you cut out Coinbase, BitPay, and a huge % of miners, you are left with almost nothing in this ecosystem.

>destroy the credibility of this sub and manipulate facts to further an agenda away from what I percieve to be the true bitcoin, the bitcoin that promises freedom from banks and poor fiscal policy for all.

With all due respect, you are very confused.  A bitcoin that forces transactions into ""Trusted 3rd Party Hubs"" is the literal opposite of a Bitcoin that gives freedom from banks.  It literally creates the infrastructure for centralized control over transactions rather than keeping it on-chain.  It continues to confound me that human beings can be so ass-backwards in their understanding of things like this.  If you want freedom from banks, then you need a decentralized system that processes transactions across millions of nodes on-chain.  This is the only way that it can be ""unstoppable"".  You push everything into for-profit third party processing centers and you not only eliminate centralization, you introduce trust into a system that was intended to be trustless, and power control over something that was supposed to be fully diluted.

>If you also covet that type of bitcoin, I'd be wary of anyone pulling you away from the developers who have stuck to that true vision since bitcoins inception.

Now I'm really confused.  Are we on the same team here?  Because Bitcoin Cash is that vision.  Bitcoin Core is not that vision. How can you possibly say that Developers who laugh at the concept of ""peer to peer cash"" are staying true to Bitcoin?   People who mock users for saying they want to buy a coffee with Bitcoin, as if this is now the biggest joke in town.  People who censor thoughts and opinions to the tune of literally hundreds of users.  How are people like that supporting a system that uses math to avoid abuse of power?   There are so many elements to the core mindset and media outlets right now that are diametrically opposed to the vision Satoshi had, its scary.  They've gone so far off track that claiming they've ""stayed true"" is almost comedy at this stage.  The last thing I will ever do is worship the developers.  As Gavin Andresen (also blacklisted by your team) recently said:  There are many developers out there who can do this.  Core is hardly the only group.  "

"You forget that BTC is literally in a bulltrend since 2015 Sept. Everyone has different bullshit explanations for it, but the main reason stays: it's the honeybadger of money. Not BCH.

I'm going to repeat myself and quote this subreddit's 9 out of 10 frontpage posts 2-3 weeks back: BTC dead (deathspiral, miners, whatever reasons), long live BCH. 

This sub is circlejerking and upvoting the most delusional content I've ever seen. Even if some people buy back BCH after the b2x fork is done with, it will never go anywhere. It is an altcoin now."
"Hi,

Keep going to both subs for a bit. Take both with a grain of salt. It sounds like you are holding on to a lot of the propaganda this sub pushes.. Be cautious there. Good luck!

"Bitcoin Cash is simply the first of many altcoin forks off of Bitcoin (with Bitcoin Gold, Segwit2X, and others following it).  Its value is going down a lot now that people are realizing it's more akin to any of the other countless altcoins than it is to Bitcoin itself.  Bitcoin Cash isn't even functioning properly from a mining perspective; it has *not once* experienced a normal difficulty increase that didn't then trigger EDA.  It's clearly only being used by opportunistic miners.

People like to give Bitcoin devs shit, and that's fair, but it's pretty clear that the  devs who really don't know what they're doing are the ones involved with Bitcoin Cash.  They just hard forked a couple months ago and now they want to hard fork again to tinker with the difficulty adjustment algorithm?  What's to say they'll get it right this time?"
"The denial is strong with you. BCH trading at ~5% of BTC = needs more time. S2X futures contracts trading at ~20% of S1X futures contracts = contracts are biased.

The market is always wrong I guess - at least when it disagrees with you. And stop equating Bitcoin Core to Blockstream, conspiracy theories are bad for your well being."
"Hmm, mental gymnastics... you mean assuming that a Fork created Two Chains at the same time? That doesn't seem complicated to me...

According to your own 'mental gymnastics' then, 'Core Bitcoin/S1X' is at a disadvantage to S2X (like BCH was to S1X). If S1X manages to hold a value of 300 USD it would be clear then that S1X is still a very valuable chain desired by a lot of people and also a potential rightful heir to the name BTC. 

That is going to be a tricky position for you to hold in the coming months... Can I ask this:

At what point would you declare the market to have chosen? What price? Or perhaps, do you think the market does have the right to choose what is BTC? Is the market not the community?

Thanks for the discussion.

"The upvotes are likely for the title.   The problem are the posts inside the thread.  Half of which have 50+ upvotes and basically state that BCH is failing.  The heavy focus on Putin is just a way to imply that Bitcoin (BTC) is organically rising in value.  This makes them happy because (to them) it means BCH is falling away organically.

It's not.  The price changes are due to the impending fork.  "
Actually this was what’s known in most circles as a “joke”. 
Precisely. Though it might be worth re-balancing a little if you are really sure of your predictions. I spent a little Bitcoin (BTC) but that's starting to look like not a particularly good move (It's not hurting yet though).
My original comment was actually referring primarily to the title. Bitcoin rising should not be seen as a good thing if you're a BCH maximalist
"You're not here to discuss. You're here to modify the narrative and make people think BCH is dying. People like you have literally flooded the sub in the last week out of desperate fear of irrelevance. 

Why did you all suddenly start posting here?   You guys did this a month ago when BCH price tanked also.  Then you all ran back to your caves when the price rebounded and I couldn't find any of you.   Why do you do this?  Because you're honest people who just want to share a difference of opinion?

Cmon.

Yesterday your team blacklisted 80% of the industry by lying that they're no longer supporting Bitcoin.  The list of companies and people in this industry you guys have ostracized is growing bigger and bigger.  That is an indication that your support is getting smaller and smaller.  Your ship is sinking.  It would be prudent to be aware of that and stop burning bridges."

Unlimited MB with no disadvantages! How lucky we are to have people like you going around telling real facts.

Well, try posting some things that run counter to this subs ideals here. You will also be censored.

I am doing that and so is the market. Looking bullish as fuck for BTC.

"If you actually believe what you've written, you should consider reevaluating the choices you've made. 80% of the industry supports my implementation when you look at the market share of the other two bitcoins... 

And that's not even the point really. I am here to discuss. If I'm 'modifying the narrative' I'm doing it to counter what I see as blatant propaganda from paid accounts who destroy the credibility of this sub and manipulate facts to further an agenda away from what I percieve to be the true bitcoin, the bitcoin that promises freedom from banks and poor fiscal policy for all.

If you also covet that type of bitcoin, I'd be wary of anyone pulling you away from the developers who have stuck to that true vision since bitcoins inception.
"
"> Bitcoin rising should not be seen as a good thing if you're a BCH maximalist

Wrong.  Bitcoin is not the software running it.  Nor is Bitcoin ""Core"" or ""Greg Maxwell"" or ""SegWit"".  

The software can change.  The miners can change.  Bitcoin is a movement and a ledger that is kept in-tact through all the fighting and forks.   BCH maximalists (white paper proponents) want Bitcoin to succeed because whatever the market decides in the end, Bitcoin is independent of the political drama. 

In the real world, nobody cares about our infighting.  They will just continue to use ""Bitcoin"".  The only people who care about Bitcoin failing are the ones who are opposed to the entire experiment.  In that sense, we are all on the same team.  Though we may fight like cats and dogs about who gets commit access to the repository."
What are you responding to?  I said absolutely nothing about honest people coming here with differing opinions.  My focus was on another element of what is going on.  I can't tell if you're pretending to be confused or what.  It was pretty obvious what I meant.

"The problem is nowhere in your assessment are you including any kind of reasoning, and you are ignoring extremely important information, letting it pass in one ear and out the other.

"Ok if you're abandoning your appeal to the legitimacy of Congressional testimony, how about your appeal to Congressional vote records? AUMF went 98-0 and 420-1, while ostensibly to deter and prevent terrorism, it has resulted in the longest and most pervasive war in US history, morphed into geostrategic arming of insurgencies/dismantling of sovereignties, and oh yeah, terrorism rates going up rapidly.

The reason it passed with such a big margin is because in most districts, it is political suicide to be a dissenting vote on a measure which is ostensibly protecting America against the baddies. It has nothing to do with how certain the testimony is, nor how appropriate the act is as a response."
Wow dude you're great at argument. I must be shit because I'm trying to keep it on topic.. If I'm conflating your point, can you explain it better instead of wanking about discourse?
So are you going to explain how he was conflating your point? He doesn't seem to know about all of this and when he asked for an explanation, you dodged his question and spoke down to him. One could say that you exposed him to ridicule.

">You forget that BTC is

I don't forget anything.  You are pretending deny reality because it doesn't suit your bias that BCH has to fail.  You are exceedingly dishonest and have low integrity.   How do you operate in life like that?  I would hate myself after awhile.

* People begin to sell BCH (and all alts) two weeks prior to a fork where having more Bitcoin equals free money. 

* People begin to buy Bitcoin 2 weeks prior to a fork where having more Bitcoin equals free money.  

You are being disingenuous, violating your own conscience, and insulting my intelligence.

The prices will return to normal proportions after the fork.  That's my prediction.  Feel free to watch it happen.  And think of me when it does.  I'll write your username down and even call you out, because of how much I dislike people like you.  Dishonest for the sake of political bias.  Your mother would be ashamed."
I trust this one a lot more though, that one seems to be heavily censored. There is a lot of proof for it.
"> I hope you don't get rekt too badly on B2X tokens.

I sold $250k worth of Bitcoin Cash for BTC last week along with everyone else, which is the 'real reason' BCH price is dropping.

You'd have to be quite unintelligent to miss out on this opportunity.  Masses of people are cashing in alts and BCH to take advantage of it.  

The price drop does not indicate BCH is failing.  Though I am not surprised you are here pushing that narrative.  Its convenient for you.  I know.  You guys flooded this sub a month ago when the price dipped a whole $100 as well.  Declaring the end of BCH.  Then the price rebounded and you all retreated to your caves.

Like everyone else, I will be converting back to BCH after the forks.  This will result in Bitcoin price settling back down, and BCH price rising once again.  It's all very very simple.

Toodles."
I disagree, but time will tell.
"You would find more positive stories about Trump in outlets of the opposite bias, in the top features stories, than you find here. Also pay careful notice to the way the titles are phrased and what emotions are they trying to evoke in the reader:

""X pushes back against a reputable report"". NBC (still reputable) done a full research and filed a report that X wants to increase nuclear bombs (a very bad act), and X is ""pushing back"" on it. But of course he will, the little devil, it makes sense to us. The reader becomes focused in the alleged ""push back"", and completely neglects to check the NBC report itself.
You can see the same technique being used here, about the B-3 bombers: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vp_WfB2yKD4

The same analysis can be done for the other two titles. All 3 are of the same side of the bias, they don't even try to alternate. And in a way they have to, because their readers are likely to be supporting that line, and would be violently frustrated if someone would just suggest that what they were parroting _might_ be false, and that they should actually think for themselves (see the message below with the F word so early this evening for a typical reaction).
"
"And the S2x fork may end up dead on arrival since there's no replay protection, and there might not be any ""air drop"". So really it's just the market behaving irrationally, like usual. Enjoy the mania while it lasts."
I would take everything seen on /r/bitcoin with a grain of salt. People on this sub paint the opposite picture. I guess we will just have to wait to see what happens.
"Based on what? Definitely not the white paper. The implementation Core is creating no longer has any resemblance to ""true"" Bitcoin. Therefore, by very definition, Core is creating the alt coin. 

As your team continues to blacklist the entire Bitcoin industry, I predict you will find yourselves sitting alone at the table. All the Reddit propaganda trolling won't play much role in preventing that."
I've been very happy with my decision to enjoy the free BCH after the split and to hold equal amounts moving forward. I trust the technology to gain acceptance far more than I trust myself to bet on which particular horse will win.
"You realize this rise is entirely because of the two upcoming forks? The money is flowing into BTC just to get more new tokens. As soon as it's over, it will flow right back. 

I believe BCH is better long-term, but I sold all of it just for this period, so I can get gold and S2x. I will then sell all of S1X to buy BCH, and will likely have more of it than I had before."

"RemindMe! 2 years ""good job"""

FYI for people wanting to claim their pre-fork BCH and exchange them for more BTC (I did this about 3 days ago):  1 Empty BTC from pre-fork wallet into a new wallet to protect them.  2 Create a new wallet on btc.com, click on BCH, and import the old wallet using its private key 3 After maybe 5 minutes, btc.com will show your balance and you can then use an exchange to sell the BCH for BTC. 4 Then move BTC into your new BTC wallet (step 1) if you wish.
"Oh no! You mean to tell me that the free coins I got a while ago are only up from $0 to $300, each while my original coins are now worth more than ever before?

Noobs selling all of their BTC for BCC has nothing to do with Roger.  I support BCC, but when all of the people here were saying they sold all of their BTC for BCC I thought it was a bad idea.  I am holding coins on both chains.  
A sudden rise in BTC because of an announcement does not devoid the chain of its underlying problems (segwit, fees, long confirmations, 1mb limit). BCH is nowhere near dead, just in a holding pattern. 2x is coming, announcements are coming, there is a lot going on in the Bitcoin space right now.

Don't you think it has something to do with people wanting to have currency on the upcoming segwit2x chain?
Your premature conclusion gives away your insecurity.
You're right. It's amazing. It's like this sub has completely given up on BCH in a matter of hours 😂
Nope, this is the uncensored, open forum sub where you're allowed to express dissenting opinions.
This is more to do with the upcoming split. Smart investors know the more bitcoin you own and altcoins you sell , the more of an UTXO airdrop in Nov you will get to dump for more bitcoins. Post split the cumulative value is typically always higher... its just smart investing

The way the 2x upgrade will work without replay protection and 95% miner support means there won't be 2 surviving chains at the end of it. Just one. Unless Core goes crazy and adds that themselves and maybe a POW change after the fork to survive.
This is *because* of the fork madness, people buy BTC because the want those free extra coins from the fork.

Pretty sure its just the banks pumping their segshit coin.
If I were new to this, I would not buy bitcoin (segwit) right now. The fundamentals are bad and we have several hardforks coming up. If you do, it would be extremely wise to invest equal amounts into Bitcoin (Segwit) and Bitcoin Cash, IMO. Do not invest in where something is. Invest in where it is going.
Noob question here.. I just started buying bit coin about 3 weeks ago. I only have about $200 worth, half on Coinbase and half on a gambling website (nitrogensports). Anyway my question is, is keeping it in Coinbase a safe option for now? How much until it is a good idea to store it on a paper wallet. Or are there other safe methods to store online. I saw the iOS app you can store it on. But is that safe? Also are their ways to buy bitcoin with out having to pay the fees every time? Thanks in advance for anyone who can answer these for me.

"When SW was locked in we MOONED, if SW2X implodes tomorrow we will MOON. Bitcoin surviving a takeover attempt of development by a majority of miners and powerful businessmen would be the most bullish sign ever. And I have no doubt that it will.

It won't be a split like BCH where everyone necessarily gets ""free money"" handed out due to the lack of EDA and (current) lack of strong replay protection. One chain is likely to die off, if not immediately then very quickly. Anyone thinking the miners will stick to their signalling when the 2X chain has block rewards at 20% of the legacy chain will be surprised to see that miners are greedy, as they should be!"

I cashed in over hundreds of BCH just so I could have more BTC for the forks. Plenty of others are doing it as well.  None of us are doing this permanently.  Its 100% to cash in on free tokens.  Usually when Bitcoin rises, all alt coins rise. This has been true since 2011.  After the forks everything will correct back.  
I expect the cumulative value to be higher but both coins to have a lower price post split. Wither BTC or B2X starts higher is anyone's guess but this will quickly change when we start dumping out B2x
How hard is it to convert to a paper wallet? And when is the fork happening?

Remind me again why we care about Purchasing Power Parity when talking about the effect on the price of Bitcoin?
I'm waiting for an unbiased futures market on a trusted exchange. We will see what happens then..

"> all alt coins have dropped

Litecoin is up more than BTC
Bitconnect up about the same as BTC
Ethereum and Bitcoin (Cash) are not down
etc.

The gold fork date was ~ Octotber 1st. They are busy pre-mining 1% of the coin supply (16,000 blocks) right now.
brainwashed by this sub?

I feel like a lot of people would have made a lot of profits after the early 300% spike
Consider it a chance to learn something. Think back and reflect on what made you decide to buy substratum. Who sold it to you. Why did it entice you, and how could you design something to entice someone like yourself at the time. Good luck to you.

"At these prices BCH is only surviving on miners willing to take huge losses.  When they get tired of subsidizing BCH as leverage to get SWX2 there will be EDAs every second day and sub one minute blocks just to keep things going.  

SWX2 is the coin for big blockers, this will make BCH dangerously obsolete. "
Has nothing to do with Putin. People in this thread are cherry picking news in an attempt to make BCH look like its just dying.  When in fact they are selling to stock up on Bitcoin for the fork.  All alt coins have dropped for the same reason.
"They have to find ""organic"" reasons because their goal is to make it look like bitcoin is succeeding, and BCH is failing. 

So it's Putin to them. It's not the upcoming forks. 

Trolls are invading this sub lately. But the greatest fucking part is it won't amount to a hill of beans in the end."
i always feel i have to few, lost money in a btc stock copying system when it removed btc stocks, and i figured selling my btc would make up for losses lol, i just regret that i did not hodl.Also bought a lot at 790 before the unstopped growth.

Russia's GDP -> $3.938 trillion (6th in the world)

Italy's GDP -> $2.234 trillion (12th in the world)"
"This only makes sense if you believe the price of 1x + 2x will be greater than btc is now. Otherwise, the smarter thing would be to sell to fiat and wait until after the fork to buy up whatever you thought was a good investment.

Why do you think the fork won't cause the price of btc to crash?"
"I like how you think your opinion is a fact. 

Especially when you are unable to show any validating evidence, analysis, or data to support your opinion. "

Pure anti-Russian propaganda. Do more independent research and less reading from biased news sources, and you'll get closer to the truth.

A wee-bit tinfoil hat material, but interesting nevertheless. Thank you.
The irony is that Cryptocurrency will also allow oligarchs to avoid capitol controls and take money out of the country and thus beyond the reach of the Kremlin which is a big problem in Russia. Its a double edged sword.
President Putin also got a new puppy!
"Russia's economy is not smaller than Italy.  That's just propaganda.  When you equalize purchasing power, Russia is the 5th largest economy in the world.

Not only are they the 5th largest economy they are practically debt free compared to almost all the countries of the ""west""."

Why do you think it will succeed given how many exchanges are pulling out of the NYA? I'm not disagreeing necessarily but is the only reason people still expect it to succeed because miners primarily support it? The last hard fork was a disaster and BCH is turning to not be worth it if you traded BTC for it so why will this hard fork be different?
"> Can everyone see this? This right here is a prime example of why this subreddit is 90% FUD about Bitcoin.

S1X is not Bitcoin. It's a joke. "

At these prices, you are doing it backwards.

Right...As if this subreddit wasn't advocating everyone to dump all their BTC for BCH nearly everyday for the past two months. 
"You mean we cashed all that BCH in so we'd have more BTC for the forks, and will cash right back out once we've stacked up free fork-coins?

Resulting in BCH going right back up?

Remind yourself in 7 weeks.  "
It was never supposed to be about price. You still have X bitcoins. The goal was to abandon fiat and create a coin that was a super set of all use cases for money. No value has been added, because no new use cases have been added. Utility has declined for Bitcoin over the last year. This is entirely speculators chasing each other.

"People are preparing for the fork. Every alt coin is dropping in value right now. Everyone I know has stocked up on BTC and plans to cash back out later. 

Brigading this sub isn't going to help your cause.  I am confused by how much effort is put into this, considering how few Bitcoiners around the world even read these posts.  

However, when your team publicly lies to the entire world on Bitcoin.org and states that Coinbase and BitPay no longer support Bitcoin - I fear you guys are in a world of trouble soon.  

Creating bad blood has been the hallmark of your movement from Day 1, so this is nothing new, but ultimately I do believe you'll find that Cobras post was the turning point for the final downward spiral of your implementation of Bitcoin software."
Welcome to our sub, propaganda troll.
"Nothing is true now mr 5 upvotes from your buddy brigaders troll? Reaaaaaalllly?

- [TRUE] ""Cryptocurrency entirely controlled by a single company"": Clogscreamcore employs most core developers, controls the repository, controls the ML, controls the forums, controls the BIP process, controls the subreddit and generally is in the position to obstruct anything and anybody. Walks like control, quacks like control, it is control, that's why they're throwing baby tantrums if that control is threatened.
- [PROBABLE] ""by means of bribery"": How do you explain people who used to hold resonable opinions suddenly turn into Clogscreamcore socketpuppets all of a sudden?
- [TRUE] ""censorship"": have you actually looked at the forum, subreddit, etc?
- [TRUE] ""narrative engineering"": You can't deny that Clogscreamcore runs coordinates campaigns to shape the narrative in their favor.
- [TRUE] ""lack of utility"": so you deny huge backlogs, high fees and limited capacity?
- [TRUE] ""huge capacity problems and backlogs"": so you deny huge backlogs and capacity problems?
- [TRUE] ""unsustainable fees"": So you deny high fees that drive away users and businesses?
- [TRUE] ""silly hats"": Most notable addition to me to the Bitcoin ecosystem.
- [TRUE] ""businesses are dropping left and right"": So you deny that businesses have actually in doves dropped Bitcoin left and right because of huge backlogs and fees? You live under some kind of extra special retard rock?

Nearly everything I said is literally true. If you think it isn't, well, I'm feel sorry for you, you live in a fantasy make belief world and it's gonna be very, very rude when you get out of it."
Honestly not a bad guess. A $1000 swing happened through the last hard fork.
Wouldn't really make a difference if you used those 200$ on bitcoin tho. It's not like those 200 would now be 5000 today. It's a much bigger chance that those 200 actually become 5000 any time soon by holding a lower market cap coin, and SUB looks promising :)
What the community wants? LOL. Check out the block sizes on BCASH chain. No one uses it.
