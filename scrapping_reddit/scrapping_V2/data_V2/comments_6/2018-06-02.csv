Will you alter your JO strategies?
Sorry. I forgot I’m on r/btc — this is to be expected. 
"> The casual user will in no way do all that shit just to use Bitcoin. People like ease of use.

On that we are in complete agreement.  And I fully expect the crypto community to make their tools better and easier over time, regardless of the laws of any particular jurisdiction.  Pirating music and movies was also difficult and slow early on, in addition to being illegal, and yet the illegality of it has not stopped it, but rather the ease of doing it has made it even more prevalent.

It may be annoying to circumvent government regulations *now*, but if the community at large values bypassing those regulations, the software will be developed to make doing just that easier and easier.

Again, this is not a moral judgment, this is simple economics.  If the technology is valuable, then it will find a way to be used.  Either people who need it will take the risk, or people who care about it will make it easier to use."
You must be aware that reproductive rates are dropping and that for some countries population decline has set in yes? You surely must be aware what that means for a fiat based deficit spending economy that counts on a growing GDP driven by a population growth of the future in order to make the future pay for present expenses...
This has to be the single most unintelligent comment I have seen on reddit. Are you joking? 
"Here's a question for you. All over the western world governments are enacting wild immigration policies designed to get as many foreigners into the respective countries as possible. Ostensibly they're doing that to combat the decline in native populations on account low reproduction. They're doing that despite knowing that it'll tear the social fabric apart, that it can have all kinds of unintended consquences (such as drastic increase in all kinds of crime), that the wellfare systems cannot handle this amount of immigration and so forth. Naturally they're trying to censor as much of the negative effects as possible to the detriment of their native citizens.

It begs the question, if reproductive rates are the problem, why aren't they trying to figure out why and how to fix it? Is it because:

1. That thought hasn't occurred to them?
2. They know what the problem is, but can't fix it? (how do they know the imported populations won't develop the same problem?)
3. They can fix it, but choose not to and instead import a population?

Which of these possible answers to you find more frightening?"
This guy governments. 
Then why is the market so scared that it crashes everytime. 
"> in addition to being illegal, and yet the illegality of it has not stopped it

Yeah... thats not kinda true. I was true years ago because no one gave a shit but current in some countries you can get warned and then fined for pirating shit."
You're over your query limit with Google Maps.  Damn.  I was going to use it tonight!
It’s more like 9 months rather than 6 months according to your reddit post history.....
Nice, you should allow prices to be shown in fiat though, first thing I do is convert because of it.
"Thanks and congratulations, I think you're doing awesome work; and your plans for the future are inspiring - working on the option to go fully-autonomous is a great choice, I believe. I guess lightning payments are not a priority at this point anyway, as the amounts transacted are not coffee-level plus fees are lower than ever on bitcoin. I wish you the best!"
The gig economy is where the crypto market has the easy potential to grow volume dramatically in a short space of time 
Make an api 
This is interesting, but what happens when Airbnb starts accepting cryptocurrencies as payment? They're not tech illiterate by any means, thus what makes you special is nullified. Thoughts?
I especially like how you used Airbnb's react\-dates OSS project lol
Can you offer stats where demand is high and supply is low? Could be useful to this community.
Nice! Any purchasers yet in crypto? I hope you connected with properties in a capital gains friendly region :)
"May I ask if you plan to create your token somewhere in the future? What happens if Airbnb decides to start accepting crypto payments, could they somewhat integrate what You have built already to their platform? Sorry for the stupid questions :) 
(And signing up  to host btw!)"
Good job! I think the mobile site needs a way of displaying prices in fiat, maybe some kind of drop down?
Keep up the good work 
what do you mean purchasers in crypto, we've had a bunch of bookings if that's what you're asking. capital gains treatment is a pain, we live in Switzerland where capital gains are tax free for individuals

Since there are only 1500 properties so far, I think it would be nice to have a static map. Because the search is date and location, I'm not sure if there's nothing at all in the area, or it's just the dates/number of guests not meeting the search criteria. Cool site, hope to try it out.
thank you for your effort kind sir!

"I'm not sure if you left it all together on purpose; if it wasn't, on Reddit you need to have blank lines between the text you want to have separated, otherwise it just continues where the previous sentence ended (there may be a gotcha if you start paragraphs with numbers though; if hou start it with something like ""2. "" Reddit will ignore the numbers you typed and just replace them with numbers starting with 1 and counting up for each additional number; I'm just not sure if it also happens if you use other symbols after the digits or just with periods)."
Please allow us to search with flexible dates. Sometimes I want to visit another town/country but will do so when it's cheapest or convenient for bookings.
Love the concept, real, tangible applications of cryptocurrency use will help grow the community. I will definitely be using it in my next travels.
Noticed the site months back and loved the concept. Great work!
This is very fascinating. The products are too cool and superb! This what we can called a masterpiece.
"I really like it. Needs to have more properties ;\) \- how do you currently get new listings?"
You are my adoption hero of the day!
