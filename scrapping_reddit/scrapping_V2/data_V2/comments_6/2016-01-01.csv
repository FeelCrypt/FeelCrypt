"No, your ad was removed by the Reddit Advertising Department, likely after theymos complained to them. I had to go through 13 rounds of [my advertisement](https://www.reddit.com/comments/3y1yvl/in_freedom_decentralization_we_trust_come_join/?campaign=t8_mqzr&ref=share&ref_source=link) before the advertising department would protect my ad against mod complaints. They wouldn't allow me to use certain words on my ad, such as ""censored"" or ""uncensored""."
Has this been blocked? I have not seen this ad all day.
Was wondering the same thing.
mods have no control over reddit ads
