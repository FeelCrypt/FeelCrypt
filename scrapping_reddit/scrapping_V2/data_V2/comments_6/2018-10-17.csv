"Finished reading the article. I still think Forbes is very factual but doesn’t understand crypto and won’t in my lifetime.   “Furthermore, all transactions are visible to everyone, which makes markets volatile and invites front-running”
The above statement is a good example of what I’m talking about.  Yes, it is true, all transactions are visible. But to add that they’re the cause  for market volatility is the authors own narrative.  I’m  no economist but I recognize that crypto is good for markets and one of the many reasons is that all transactions are visible.  This is not a bad thing.  Rant done. Thank you for posting tho. All knowledge is good knowledge  "
Interesting post. I should read this article, even though it’s from Forbes and I don’t think they understand crypto.
