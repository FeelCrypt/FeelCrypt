"Well, that message is way over a year old, eth still doesn't have proof of stake which the entire message basicially came down to.

And full of pointless lies.

>The most similar electronic product that offers this is the anonymous tap to pay, prepaid payment card. It is easy, it is anonymous, it wont be hacked like phones, it has the ability to limit exposure to compromise by having limited balance that automatically recharged and the end of the day. Implementing this in Bitcoin would not be possible because the small chip in the card is not connected to the internet, and sharing your private key is a security hazard. But what if your wallet/contract could use asymmetric encryption to accept a different secret payment key on every payment. This way it is possible to implement the payment with a touch to pay card in a secure way. In Ethereum it is also possible to program a contract to recharge a wallet at the end of every day for added security, It is also possible to automatically exchange Ethereum for a token that is backed by a stable currency for those merchants that are worried about exchange fluctuations. 

Nothing stated for the eth card is impossible for bitcoin.

Truth. I'm a neutral user insofar as I hate both subs equally.

Here's a comment of mine which was hidden from rbitcoin recently...

that's exactly what r/btc is doing.
"At one point earlier this year literally 100% of the moderator team here worked for Roger's businesses. 

Certainly sounds like a small, centralized group with control to me.

There are also no Core devs or Blockstream employees among their mod team. "

/u/CashTipper tip 0.1 USD
Man, I'm gonna tell you right now, the rabbit hole is crazy deep on this issue. I don't fully understand everything about it, but I can tell you that theymos, a mod of r/bitcoin, has been confirmed to be censoring posts and scamming users out of large amounts of btc. There have been a few breakdowns of the state of affairs that have been posted here, you can probably find them if you search for them. It goes way beyond theymos, though. Basically from what I can tell, the main btc block chain has been taken over by people who a) don't fully understand the purpose of bitcoin or b) wish to destroy it. Maybe someone who knows more can correct me or expand on some of this.
At a very basic level, r/bitcoin is pretty legendary for censorship and dissent being suppressed. It's the whole reason r/btc came into existence. So for this person to claim that r/btc is more centralized is pretty funny.
"Both communities are highly toxic. Claiming r/Bitcoin is less toxic than r/btc as fact is misleading and completely subjective.

In regards to centralisation, the r/Bitcoin moderators have a particular viewpoint about scaling of Bitcoin, and will ban dissenting opinions - the r/Bitcoin echo chamber is entirely built upon the whims of a select group. 

Whereas in r/btc unless you're actually harassing etc. you won't get banned, your comments won't be deleted. Whilst there is a certain viewpoint that is mainstream in this subreddit, other points of view are allowed. Anyone can come here and submit.

In summary, the discussion in r/Bitcoin is tightly controlled by what is effectively a central authority - theymos and co. decide the narrative. In r/btc, no one is banned for alternate opinions - no centralised group is controlling discussion. Therefore it is dishonest and quite false to claim r/Bitcoin is less centralised than r/btc."

It's not bch because r/btc split off from r/bitcoin before the fork of the main blockchain. Many people (on /rbtc anyway) will probably tell you that bch is closer to the original btc white paper than btc core. If you want facts, you have to do your due diligence, like the rest of us. Sorry I don't have a bunch of links to spoon feed you. Do your own research, decide for yourself. Personally, I'm holding both.

Wait, what? How would any transactions take place off chain? That would, in fact, not be a transaction at all. I've hung around that sub for quite a while, and I have always heard the **exact** opposite being talked about and promoted.

> Taking transactions off chain to use a 3rd party is effectively creating a middle man between me and my purchases.

Yes, precisely. And this is NOT what people on r slash bitcoin is saying. At all.

If the mods want this, I couldn't say, but I have never seen anyone push this agenda at all. Ofc, I'm not a cryptographer, developer nor savvy enough to wade through the code and understand wth I'm looking at, so I can't say it's untrue. But I've never seen this pushed for. Ever. Quite the opposite.

In fact, people in the ""Core camp"" say similar things about BCH..."
"I'm talking about the /r/btc modlogs here:

https://snew.github.io/r/btc/about/log#?theme=btc

"
No, I'm saying that r/btc discusses btc and btc forks without censorship. r/bitcoin discusses bitcoin core with censorship. So, you can either weed through a bunch of garbage with nuggets of truth on r/btc, or you can read only one group's narrative on r/bitcoin. 
"When I said ""They"" I meant Blockstream and those of which are core developers. This is my understanding of the Lightening Network as those transactions would not take place on the main bitcoin blockchain and would be on a side chain to keep blocks from filling up with small transactions. I've been using Bitcoin since 2013 and since then it's become impossible to send micro transactions with out paying incredibly high fees. This wasn't always the case. I have seen this pushed for and I've even made comments about it in the past few years even back when Bitcoin Unlimited was just an idea people were considering."
I don't understand. You want facts but dismiss the bitcoin white paper as bullshit. It may or may not be the perfect road map, but it certainly started the crypto movement and shouldn't be flippantly disregarded. You're right though, it's not the point of crypto. Fortunately, that wasn't the point I was making. I was merely trying to explain why this subreddit is called r/btc and not r/bch. Good luck in the cryptosphere, sir. 
Well it would be a lot easier on \r/bitcoin because we could see the thousands of banned users and comments. 
Ok fair enough.
"> You want facts but dismiss the bitcoin white paper as bullshit

I never said it was bullshit. My only point was to not hold it as some form of religious text that must be followed to the letter. (I was merely reacting to your comment that in some regards, BCH could actually be closer to the original white paper)

> shouldn't be flippantly disregarded

I never said it should. I think it was a starting point, but not a roadmap to paradise (like some seem to believe)."
"To be perfectly honest, I could not give two shits which are the closest to Satochi's white paper. He was not some kind of God, he was human and probably made mistakes, or miscalculated some variable. To strive to be as close as the original paper as possible, is not the point of any crypto - the point is to what is best for this space and to make crypto's viable options for people. 

Everything else is just bullshit that no one will remember in the end. "
"The claim that BCH is centralised hinges on:

1. Bitcoin ABC being the most popular implementation (there are 4 implementations)
2. One miner controlling 90% of the hash-power (should be fixed this weekend with BCH being more profitable to mine than BTC)
"
Then he should learn to English gooder.
"Honestly I don't believe they want to ""destroy Bitcoin"" and I hate when people day that. They want Bitcoin to succeed but they want it to succeed in such a way that they've profit from it's success. They received a lot of investor money and they will need to pay back those investors. They are trying to find a way for people to spend their Bitcoin and have the transactions take place off chain saving using tech that they themselves created and will profit from. This is why they want small blocks, to keep them full and force people to either pay high fees or use their tech which will most likely have lower fees (conveniently). It is my opinion that all transactions should be on the main blockchain the way it was intended and I don't believe anyone should make profit from me simply spending my money. Bitcoin was designed for us to be our own banker without a middle man. Taking transactions off chain to use a 3rd party is effectively creating a middle man between me and my purchases."

In the early days of /r/btc simply having -50 comment karma was enough to get all your comments banned by the automoderator. (admitted by multiple mods at the time, can provide links if interested)

Even now, comments by new users & fresh throwaways are censored.

(check the public modlogs, today alone has numerous ""REMOVED, ACCOUNT AGE LESS THAN REQUIRED"" deletions)
"
"It all sounds good in theory, but in reality they are difficult to interact with and the logs include very little detail... sometimes none at all. 

There are regularly comments deleted with the only reason given being ""REMOVE"".

Users get banned without any reference or link to the offending comment.

Check the modlogs for yourself, many times there's just a single word reason given. 

I've literally seen ""Banned Permanently."" as the only ""reason"" given for a ban here...
"
"That's a valid argument, but it seems somewhat distinct from describing /r/bitcoin as more centralized.

The first FOURTEEN links in the /r/btc sidebar are to Roger Ver's company, which most of the mods work for. 

Objectively that just screams centralization, no? "
You can just minimize comments you don't want to read. A shill pm is pretty much on topic in a topic about shill pms.
"Sorry no, I don't like it here. I stopped liking it the minute Roger started openly appointing moderators based solely on how much they malign Core/Blockstream. That's a sure way to create an echo chamber.

Basically an amount of Bitcoin Cash will be sent to your address equivalent to the average cost of 1 pint of beer.
perhaps I mispoke when I said the block chain. What has happened, however, is that the main communication forums for bitcoin are all run by the same people or person. Just google something like theymos bitcoin censorship and decide for yourself. I'm not trying to spread FUD. 
"You can't even call it moderation when it ignores all their posted rules and bans/removed/allows things not at all on the rules but instead on unposted persoanl biases the mods have.

You can't call it moderation unless you called it random fact-ignorant moderation with censorship"
The point is more that a small, centralised group controls the narrative in the other sub via censorship. Here there is no such control of discussion.

"I actually wrote something like that a while ago.

[Here it is](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5wbyc5/my_draft_for_a_new_rbtc_faq_explaining_the_split/)

The community is of course welcome to all pitch in to improve it."
Good bot
"Hasn't reached the ethereum PM levels yet

> I am sending you this message because the crypto community is too heavily censored, please read carefully.
The original of idea bitcoin is to create a decentralized money system that prevents censorship and being shutdown. Proof of work seemed like a good way to achieve that. The real power in the bitcoin world is helt by the miners, as long as the mining process is properly decentralized bitcoin will be decentralized. But real world competition caused many cracks to appear in this model, the first flaws that appeared were pooled mining (centralizing power with mining operators), then came ASICs (Centralizing power with mining operators with good industry connections), then came cheap electricity + latency issues (Centralizing power with mining pools with access to cheap electicity and low latency to others big mining pools). These pressures has essentially caused mining to be centalized mainly in China because there they have cheap electricity, good industry for creating ASICs and low latency to other chinese mining pools (and high latency to the rest of the world).
One important thing to keep in mind is that bitcoin itself can evade capital controls and move seamlessly accross borders. But mining equipment cannot. It would be easy to confiscate all mining equipment in the country and use it to destroy bitcoin.
So what is the solution to this problem? Proof of stake is the solution because it removed the physical element and allows network voting power to move seamlessly accross borders too. Traditional Proof of Stake contains some flaws like the Nothing at Stake problem. But the new algorithm designed for proof of stake in Ethereum solved all these issues.
The bitcoin developer community has proven that it is unable to make even small changed to the consesus algorithm. So completely switching to a different model is never going to happen.
If you are willing to open your mind and learn about how Ethereum will beat bitcoin by being far superior to bitcoin watch the videos of Devcon1
Bitcoin is doomed and Ethereum will replace it.
Obviously most people involved in Ethereum are aware of this. But for most other people it is not so obvious. But it is hard to convince the masses because they are not reading enough information about Ethereum, either because of censorship in subs or because of denial.
Therefore I think it is the mission of each of us to get the word out. Only by saying it often and giving clear examples we can teach the masses what we already know. Try to reach at least on uninformed person every day. (If you lack ideas, just post the link to this post in different reddit subs with target audience).
First of all it is important to remind people that Bitcoin was also once small, and that people also did not believe in Bitcoin because they couldn't imagine what benefit it would give over conventional payment systems. That perception changed dramatically for bitcoin and the same will happen to Ethereum. It is important to emphasise this because people often use the psychological principle of Social Proof to make decisions in unknown situations, this is currently working against Ethereum, the underlying reasoning is, ""If Ethereum is so great why is it so cheap?"", ""If Ethereum is so great why is everyone talking about Bitcoin?"", ""If Ethereum is so great, why are the smart people X, Y and Z not invested in it?"".
Second of all it is important to emphasise that not only is Ethereum a crypto that offers a whole new concept of the decentralized web, it is also better than Bitcoin at being a currency for payments. This is easy to show by explaining a real world scenario. Imagine the perfect crypto currency, obviously it should be possible to re-implement the most convenient payment systems used today using that crypto currency, and doing so in a decentralized way, with no added fees or middle man. It should be able to behave very much like cash in being able to spend it quick and easy. The most similar electronic product that offers this is the anonymous tap to pay, prepaid payment card. It is easy, it is anonymous, it wont be hacked like phones, it has the ability to limit exposure to compromise by having limited balance that automatically recharged and the end of the day. Implementing this in Bitcoin would not be possible because the small chip in the card is not connected to the internet, and sharing your private key is a security hazard. But what if your wallet/contract could use asymmetric encryption to accept a different secret payment key on every payment. This way it is possible to implement the payment with a touch to pay card in a secure way. In Ethereum it is also possible to program a contract to recharge a wallet at the end of every day for added security, It is also possible to automatically exchange Ethereum for a token that is backed by a stable currency for those merchants that are worried about exchange fluctuations.
Third of all it is important to note that Bitcoin is never going to be implementing these changes. Look how hard it is for them to implement a blocksize increase. Changing the scripting language to Turing complete would be a far more controversial change. One that the miners will probably never agree to this. And also keep in mind that quick payments need either zero-confirmation transactions or fast blocktime.
So if Ethereum has the potential to implement the most convenient payment system imaginable but Bitcoin cannot then one can only conclude that Ethereum will win in the long run. Bitcoin will die like Myspace, and Ethereum will become the golden standard."
"It's not really heavily censored. People have shouted about censorship on /r/Bitcoin forever and yet I've never been banned for expressing controversial views. Not saying it's never happened but to the extent people claim I doubt. Which is why I'd have to to question if those post is real or not (though I could see it being true). 

Though it's probably fair to say /r/BTC seems to have a somewhat greater diversity of views than /r/Bitcoin. "

are we just going to ignore the fact that OP must have made a fresh account, pretending to be new to BTC and shill-posting hew was going to buy some BCH? lol
All the miners are using that random text. I have no idea who any of the miners are besides the ones that identify themselves. Perhaps that random text is a default setting for the mining software.
"We are all irrational market actors. I do not try to pretend I am not, but I try to keep my emotions in check when making decisions.
