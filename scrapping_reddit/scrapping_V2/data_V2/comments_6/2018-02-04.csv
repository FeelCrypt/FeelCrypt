your tips encouraged group think 
You don't know what you are talking about. High end cars, exotics, and such can be bought used with low miles and they don't depreciate if you don't put a lot of miles on them. Many go up in value depending on their demand and rarity. I'm not talking about Lexus, I'm talking about Ferrari, Aston Martin, etc. If you have the money for that sort of car you probably have storage too.

Yes, I know. I have been arguing that. I don't use the tip bot. 
Yes, they are very expensive and you need to know what you are doing.  But as I said, certain high end cars can be investments that appreciate--and that's accurate.  If you have the money it certainly makes more sense to spend $100k to buy a used exotic that has already depreciated and will hold its value over $70k on a new luxury car that will depreciate until it is worthless.  If you know what you're doing you can buy and use cars for no end cost, or even make some $$.
You dont get capitalism, everyone is a potential future client. LOL.
But those newer cars only keep or increase their value if you have a complete checkbook without any gaps and or missing inspections etc and that is very expensive!

The ""ways to encode data in txs"" that he's referring to, which Ethereum relies on to function, that was taken out of bitcoin, stay with me here, by the Core devs. This was loooong after Satoshi was no longer active.

This functionality is being restored into BCH so that things like Ethereum can once again be built on top of the base layer, such as is *currently* impossible in BTC.

If you want to argue that that being referred to isn't an opcode, fine, give me a better word for it.

"> This is a yes/no thing. Either you agree or you disagree. You now both denied that you agree and that you disagree.
> 
> Which is your position?

It's most definitely not a yes/no, black/white situation. Since you ask, I will tell you. I am very much in favour of small low fees, but **not at the cost of diminished security**. In other words, fees to me have lower priority than network security. You may wonder how the two are related, and I'll give you two examples.

One, [here](http://randomwalker.info/publications/mining_CCS.pdf) is a paper that discusses Bitcoin in the case of no block reward, which we all know it's coming. It's a techincal paper, but do take the time to read it. In short, Bitcoin is bound to break down completely, unless there's a *healthy backlog of unconfirmed transactions*. The reason is that miners could cheat very easily. Now, you can say ""We'll worry about it when we get there."", but since we know that txs fees will eventually HAVE to make up most/all of the incentive for mining, who's to say WHEN the switch from block reward --> txs fees incentive is to happen? OK, probably not in this very moment, but my gut is telling me it's sooner than many believe, so I say ""Hell, I'm fine if it happens now."".

Two, you may have heard about the ""hash rate death spiral"", which could kill any coin. If a price shock happens, and mining becomes less profitable, miners will switch to other coins. (This is not theoretical, pie in the sky, kind of argument, we are witnessing this currently with BTC and BCH, and it happened in the past with other SHA256 coins. ) In turn, this will make the txs slower and slower, thus favouring other coins and damaging the reputation of a given coin, driving the price down, and only accelerating the demise of a coin. Unless txs fees are high enough, that is. Why? Because as the network gets slower, the fee market will see strong fee bidding, which can SIGNIFICANTLY increase the block reward, and so make mining VERY profitable again. Guess what happens then? Yep, miners come back to the ""dying"" coin, and provide vital support. This may seem like another one of those theoretical/paranoid scenarios, but we've seen this happen with BTC and BCH. 

Don't just dismiss this and tell me I'm a Core/Blockstream shill or something like that. I think I provided very solid evidence on how txs fees are not only useful, but KEY for a healthy and secure network. So this is what I mean network security before fees - High fees become, effectively, network security insurance. In this sense, BCH will need to come up with some clever solution to avoid this problem. If dynamic blocks are ever introduced, increasing the size to accomodate for low fees, a severe price shock will have miners abandon the coin in droves. I don't know if the DAA has any other security flaws, but as of now it seems to be doing a good job at guaranteeing the security. Maybe there are other drawbacks, but I honestly don't know about them... maybe there just aren't, and the DAA solved the second problem in this way. But the first problem remains, and you cannot just wish it away or ignore it. For now, as far as I can see, BTC has a better security model than BCH, and that's basically the main reason I support it."

"Q:

>So you agree with me that it is the most most important things (a kill-criteria if above a certain point)? Great.

A:

>That's also not what I said, nor what is implied by my words.

This is a yes/no thing. Either you agree or you disagree. You now both denied that you agree and that you disagree.

Which is your position?

Some other comments: 

1.Buterins quote is from 2014 I think. Yes ETH has scaling problems, but scalability is their nr.1 priority. The endgoal is transaction and computation at a tiny fraction of a cent. source:  https://tunein.com/radio/Unchained-Big-Ideas-From-The-Worlds-Of-Blockchain-And-Fintech-p887100/?topicId=119409657

2.I do not know why you think I am hostile towards the LN. I am very much hoping that it will succeed. I am hostile towards the decision-making that has lead to the current state of BTC.

3.

>I am simply pointing out a limitation/feature/property of the current design for BTC and BCH

Ok. 

Current design of BCH has always allowed for 1c-5c transactions. If price, amount of transactions or whatever else changes I have faith in the devs to make the necessary changes to restore functioning 1c-5c transactions within a reasonable time.

Current/past design of BTC has previously allowed for 1c-5c transactions. Things changed, stuff happend and here we are now."
"You lack in comprehension and logical deduction capacity.

&nbsp;

>Your assumption that BCH could just 1000x in price and noone would restore the ability to set 1c/ sub-1c fees is utterly ridiculous and not based in reality.

I made no assumption. My exact words:

> I am simply pointing out a limitation/feature/property of the **current** design for BTC and BCH

and I emphasized a key piece of information - CURRENT.

You are saying BCH would get modified. OK, I'll take it at face value. BTC has chosen a different route, LN. Both approaches exist because EVERYONE recognizes the importance of low txs fees, we just disagree on how to achieve that. (No, not getting into discussions on the LN, so don't even start.) 


&nbsp;

>So you agree with me that it is the most most important things (a kill-criteria if above a certain point)? Great.

That's also not what I said, nor what is implied by my words.

&nbsp;

>Yeah ""everything else being equal"", sure. It is not though.

Understanding the individual pieces of the puzzle is key to understand the whole picture. If broken software produces ludicrous fees, which is happening for both BTC and BCH, there's room to optimize. But what you cannot say is that *small blocks are causing high fees* anymore than you can say that ""we must increase the number lanes on a highway because drunken drivers cause accidents"". 

With the above, one FUNDAMENTAL reason why BTC fees are ""high"" is because of the very high BTC price.  If 1 BCH = 1BTC = ~$8,500, then the median fee would be ~7x as high as it is now, and that is at a time when blocks are nowhere near full. Go ask ETH what happenend when they started getting congestion on the network, and see how well did that Vitalik's quote age.



"
">Again, if BCH was $1m, the fees I mentioned above would be standard fare.

No. If BCH would start to appreciate in price there would be changes made so that low fees get maintained.

Your assumption that BCH could just 1000x in price and noone would restore the ability to set 1c/ sub-1c fees is utterly ridiculous and not based in reality.

BCH wants to be a currency. Fees of what is currently valued at under 5c of USD is absolutely crucial for this.

Q:
>Are you suggesting that fees in $ are not the most important thing to its usefulness as money?

A: 
>No, that's not what I'm saying

So you agree with me that it is the most most important things (a kill-criteria if above a certain point)? Great.

>And no, fees are not 1:1 correlated with price, it is based on how much other people are willing to pay and software-limitations.

>Yes they are. 100% they are. Everything else being equal, fees increase directly with price, in linear fashion with coefficient 1. At $100 per BTC, a 1sat/b txs is EXACTLY 100x cheaper than a 1sat/b txs at $10,000 per BTC. And, again, this does not depend on the block size!!!

Cost to transact in BTC does not increase with price.

Yes, when BTC was ~10x cheaper than today, the corresponding median txs fee would have been ~$0.37.


It's clear that you don't know what you're talking about when you report the txs fee in $. I'll leave it with you that if BCH was $1m, the **absolute minimum txs fee** would be $2.26. In reality, at current loads and fees, with median txs fee for BCH of ~20b/sat, the fee would be ~$45.

Last time I logged in was years ago :-) 
"It's just a piece of paper with a private and public key written on it. Sometimes a QR code for ease of use. 

Once your private and public key is generated, you can then send funds to the public key (wallet address), as and when you need. 

The private key is used on any wallet provider when you want to access your coins. 

You can store the piece of paper anywhere. Your actual wallet if you want!

However if you lose this piece of paper, you lose your coins - unless you also memorised your backup seed and/or private key. 

Also if someone finds this piece of paper. They have access to your funds. "
"Maybe not easy but doable. For example download [Tails OS](https://tails.boum.org/) on to a [thumb drive](http://www.easy2boot.com/) and boot from it on a computer not connected to the internet. You should be able to generate a privatekey and address that you can write down. Then send your funds to that address and there is your paper wallet. 

Make sure to check hashes when you download a .ISO
On windows there are a lot of freeware programs that can do this for you.

With this system you should be pretty save generating a paper wallet.

Nice.
"I can only really speak to myetherwallet (MEW) but I suspect the Electrum (BTC) and Electron Cash wallet (BCH, search this sub) can be used in a similar way. Note that many ""fancy"" wallets (I guess I'm thinking of Exodus here), store your private keys (encrypted) on your Internet machine, so they are a non-starter for absolute security. The important thing is to understand where and how your key is being created, and make sure it is not done on a machine that is ever online. Similarly, when you create a transaction, your private key must be used to sign the transaction while off line, and never be exposed to the Internet. Recently I have used only hardware wallets and MEW (see below).

MEW can be downloaded and run via a web browser, but you need to run it off line. So, download the MEW package to a USD stick and verify its integrity. *Make sure* you navigate to the correct website, there are a lot of fake (phishing) ones around. Once downloaded you can move it to your clean offline computer. You can, in fact, unpack the software straight to the memory stick and run it using a browser from there, this way your keys remain on the stick, rather than the machine (this may or may not be helpful). From here, you can generate the keys (i.e. create a new wallet). The software also allows you to create the transaction offline, once you provide a recipient address. The resulting transaction info can then be copied to an online machine and broadcast to the blockchain (using MEW). This way, your private key never left the clean computer.

My recommendation, long before you want to move any substantial amount of currency, is configure a test wallet (online) and play with the software with a small amount of ETH (or BTC / BCH etc), so you are comfortable with how it works. Maybe create a couple of wallets and send currency between them. Once happy, you can do the same thing with an offline wallet, and again, once happy, you can go to your ""final"" production wallet(s). You'll want to maybe create a separate digital back up on another stick (that never sees the Internet), and also print out the QR code for the private key and store it securely somewhere (again, maybe multiple copies). You might even want to destroy ALL digital information and only rely on paper (but if you do, remember paper can be lost, stolen, burned, damaged etc :). You start to see why hardware wallets are quite attractive because they alleviate a lot of this hassle. (Strictly, they are not a ""one stop"" solution, but you get the idea).

ps, if you care about the philosophy of crypto currency (i.e. a decentralised economy), I wouldn't bother with XRP :)"

"Aha I see. JSON backups were removed when the wallet went full HD for V3; encrypted backups can still be restored on the site if you need it."
"USB on the go.  it's the ability to plug standard USB devices into your phone by using a dongle. The dongle has a male micro USB on one end (this plugs into the phone) and a female standard USB on the other end.    Not all Android phones support it and iPhone doesn't support it.  

This allows you to plug in various things, like flash card readers, external drives/memory sticks, and, for me, a hardware crypto wallet.   this is key when you are traveling with an iPhone (which doesn't allow USB on the go--surprise surprise) because you don't need to rely on a foreign computer but can use the android for this purpose. 

The samsung galaxy s6 provides enough power thru this method so that the Trezor wallet can power up and function.

and in order to power up the hardware wallet and use it you need a computer (Or phone like in my setup above) plus a  browser and internet access.    The downside of traveling without your own hardware is that most often hotels won't even allow USB access so you can't even plug in your crypto wallet into their desktops, or install any chrome extensions (needed for wallet access)"

"If she can use Bitcoin Cash to buy or sell something locally or on the internet then why would she or I have use for an exchange? I don't even use exchanges. My Bitcoin Cash comes from tippr bot and yours.org
Sending it from computer program to computer program is a lot of fun if you ask me. If I can send ""money"" this way to anybody in the world. Without a hassle, with low fees, 1 - 3 seconds before the notification pops up. Well I think that's a great product! Now it's not very useful yet but that might change in the future.

">  I'd rather have at least some insurance as a compromise

If you don't trust yourself, then you'll have to trust someone else. Your wallet is as secure as you are.

"One mans fact is another's propaganda. A $3 minning fee in nothing compared to the counter party risk of keeping thousands of dollars of bitcoin on an exchange.

"> What are the chances of the software generating a same public key twice? That would mean 2 people have the same wallet address?

Small. I have read discussion of this around the Internet but I don't have a link to hand. To put it in perspective, a lottery often involves choosing 6 numbers from 100, and the odds are around ~1 / 10^9 (sequence does not matter). Crypto keys involve choosing 24 numbers from 2000 (where sequence order does matter), with odds around ~1 / 10^79. I don't know what this converts to in terms of how it would take a brute force attack but I think its thousands of years..."
"Each party can extract their part of the funds immediately if the other party is on-line and cooperative.  Each party can extract their part of the funds after a time delay if the other party is permanently off-line or non-cooperative.  Each party can extract their part of the funds and the other party's part of the funds if the other party violates the protocol to attempt to steal his previous payments.

If by ""hold"" you mean the ability to immediately control the funds, then each party only jointly holds their part of the funds.  If by ""hold"" you mean ability to control the funds after the time delay (which is determined at the time the channel is set up), then each party controls their funds at all times, provided that they don't attempt to cheat by violating the protocol.  (This discussion assumes that the fees involved are insignificant in relation to the funds involved.)"
"that sounds a lot like the argument for ""never invest in crypto"". I'd rather have at least *some* insurance as a compromise. I work in tech and I'm aware of how unsecure most people's wallets are, as well as how I'm not taking proper security precautions in most cases to hold myself liable. It's not something I'm interested in, so I pay a premium to the exchange I feel is least likely to have an issue. 

You're never truly secure with any investment on this planet. So giving a dogmatic ""NEVER"" without considering all of the variables is never good. Take it on a case by case basis and do your research (""never"" follow a dogma). Thats why we're all here somehow on this subreddit. YMMV."
"I've read the fine print. That's why I use it. Connections are via HTTPS. If there's a security breach on the network itself (more likely), they do cover that. It's in the fine print. On your own wallet, you don't even have that if there's some anomaly on the entire BTC network one day (and that could be in any case, especially with LN which works on a second layer). 

Further, just because you prefer to support crypto one way (via a personal wallet) which works for you doesn't mean it's the definitive and only way to do things. This is a kind of close minded mentality on this sub which comes up often. People should just be at least somewhat aware that the exchanges are pushing up a demand and thus the price and value by making things more accessible to more consumers (whether that is sometimes bad or not). And also, you can offload to a wallet at whatever time you feel that you can take on the overhead and responsibilities of managing your own wallet and personal network security."
"I suggest they have 2 or 3 different layers. layer one is their usual machine that they are comfortable working with. This will be like a wallet with banknotes in. You don't run over street with 20 000 USD in your wallet. The second layer would be a linux machine that can also work offline. You sync it online and you keep it offline as much as possible. You only need this once in a while. Your third layer is a paper wallet, like having valuables in a safe. You hardly ever use this. 

Now you could say that this goes beyond people's skillset. But this can be taught.  Being your own bank is quite the responsibility. The problem with the coinbase bank is that crypto can not be reversed. Unlike a fiat bank when if funds from the bank get stolen, you will get your money back. And you might not even know there was a theft to begin with.

"Too bad your friend didnt use an exchange... oh wait, that would have been hard, wouldn't it?

Canadian banks, just like telecoms are stuck in the past in order to fuck their customers. To think what they do is a worldwide problem is naive at best. 

Exchanges charged 0.2% per trade, so you are at 0.4% fee to transfer money. Plus the 2~20$ fee on the chain. 

This is also assuming that both person are holding the exchange in order to buy/sell at the same time in order to lock the price or else... wait for a 5~10% swing for when its all done. "

"It's a piece of paper with a wallet address and the private key (password to access the funds)... the idea is to print it off and store it somewhere secure.

"
Yeah, I really don't know if I believe this conspiracy theory to be honest. 
"But right now it does not suck at all. 
Watch [this video](https://youtu.be/f27BakLwZCU?t=1109) of me using it. Ask the people here and on twitter that are using tippr. It does not suck at all, it's pretty great already. That is why people here are getting excited again. Do you know how many local communities are started based around Bitcoin Cash? Worldwide there are enormous amounts of local sharing communities that don't use fiat but use IOU's for exchanging services with other services.  It's not to much about money or getting rich but about communities. Well all of these have their own system. Most use computers and the internet. In greece they have become very popular when the 2008 crisis hit the country. Well all of these now have some new technology to work with to make their lives a little easier. 

Anyway, right now it already has a lot of benefits to offer over any other financial system on the internet. Just ask the people here that are using it as a payment system/currency.

Look at yours.org, it's the currency of yours.org. 

For me as an artist, now I finally have some steady income from my music in the winter. Why would I miss out on this? It's not possible for me to have this any other way. How you one user that listend to my music on soundcloud press a button and I receive something of value that I exchange and then buy a pizza with? Youtube? Not possible.  So for content creators this can be life changing. Instead of only the big youtube channels making some money now even smaller content creators can start making a little bit of money. 

If you don't see the benefits of that, then what could you possibly see as a benefit. Why are you even on this sub? 

It does not suck for me or the more technological advanced user ... it does kind of suck for the computer illiterate person. But with technology this has always been that way. The first internet businesses made a lot of money because they where the first intternet businesses just as right now on yours.org I make some good money on my music because there are not to many musicians active on the platform.  Better tools will be build that will allow even my mother to use Bitcoin Cash.  My mother could not use a computer in the 80's. Way to difficult for her. Now it's easier. Why would the same thing not happen with crypto?  Do you really have a good argument against crypto just because right now it's not for everybody in the world? I mean there are people in this world that have never used a computer or phone in their life ... are they a good argument against computers and phones?

"Those are not as much fun :-) 

No but seriously, I recently send 140 EUR from my Canadian bank to a friend in Belgium. The total in CAD was 263 CAD. With the current exchange rate this would have been 216.72 CAD. The rest was for my Canadian bank, spread + fee. And it took 4 days. 

I would very much like there to be a worldwide accepted system to transfer money without having to wait 3 days or pay a 30 CAD fee. (yes paypal is a bit better but still does not solve the problem) 

I mean in the 1980's you could have told everybody that was excited about email but it was kind of complex to just ... send a letter? 

Also the bank can decide to freeze your account. If you use crypto the right way nobody can do this to you.  Using crypto has benefits and detriments and it's very young technology. Give it another 10 or 20 years and then we will talk. It will eventually be accepted by everybody just like mobile phones and email.

Especially for the newbies, yes. I recently commented on a post about some Italian exchange that suddenly discontinued withdrawals of a particular crypto. All I said was that there was no sane reason for anyone to leave their crypto currencies on an exchange. That they should have moved it to a paper wallet. People were upset by my comment! Some did not even comprehend what I was trying to tell them.

"What i don't understand is why is there less trust with exchanges than the wallets, either the desktop wallets or online wallets. Don't I have to trust the makers of the wallet? Who's to say that some dodgy looking wallet that someone coded isn't safe. E.g. myetherwallet.com looks awfully sketchy but people seem to trust it more than keeping money on Binance or wherever.

Edit: I downloaded Bitcoin core a few years ago and had the wallet backup file. Now i can't regain access to my Bitcoins that I held in 2016. So this bad experience kinda made me feel sketchy towards the wallets. Especially if i want to long term hodl, and maybe i'm asleep with there is some important update or whatever."
And you just summarized why cryptocurrency is doomed to fail.

"If you are day trading crypto, you need to keep some crypto on exchanges. And it doesn't make sense to withdraw a small amount of crypto what with the hefty withdrawal fees that exchanges charge, often times several times more than the actual mining fees. Even Poloniex charges a 0.0001BCH withdrawal fee for BCH, which is outrageous. 

Some exchanges charge 0.0005-0.001BCH for withdrawal. Highway robbery because you know damn well that 1 sat/byte is enough to get into the next block for BCH. And there are times where 2 sat/byte is all you need for BTC even if you are lucky. In my country, BTC withdrawal fees at exchanges range from 0.0015-0.0025BTC.  Which is ludicrous. And if you live here, you have no other choice if you want to convert your fiat to BTC. I buy a lot of my BTC on the OTC market to avoid that nonsense and because I have good rep, I get a good deal on my coins. On alt trading sites, BTC withdrawal fees are typically 0.0005BTC-0.001BTC and even that is expensive. 

Exchanges are gouging customers on withdrawals because they don't want you to withdraw and take ownership of your coins. They want you to keep all of your crypto with them, as if they were a bank. A bank with no deposit insurance!"

okay. What counts as a timelocked contract? All possibilities, please."
"I've been looking for an external wallet to store all my crypto from Coinbase. 
I've seen a couple of different options on Amazon (Nano Ledger & Trezor was the most common.) 

What are some recommendations for an external wallet and is Amazon a credible place to order them. Or should I just get them from the direct source?"
Can we do the same with eth and ltc?
So I installed coinbase on my phone and purchased $25 of BTC a week ago. I have nothing on my phone that says I have the coins, it shows my wallet as empty. My bank says it charged, though. Any ideas? :/
Thank you for your post. I have been wondering about this issue since I got back into crypto a month ago. Besides investing for monetary purposes, I invest because of the philosophy behind crypto. I got into this years ago when BTC was worht $100. Unfortunately I bought them through MtGox and WeExchange and ended up with nothing when they came crashing down. At that time I had no idea about security issues and I only invested $2000 so I sucked it up and tried to move on. I did accept my losses and took it as a learning experience but I’ve always wanted to get back into investing in crypto and I finally decided to do it. But I am so a bit paranoid about losing my assets again...I did some research on wallets but I find so much contradictory information that I don’t know what I can’t trust. Is my best bet a paper wallet? I currently hold BTC, ETH, LTC in coinbase and XRP in a toast wallet. What do you guys recommend I do? Are there any cons to keeping them in a paper wallet besides the obvious of losing the actual paper? I’m in it for the long run so I don’t need my coins somewhere I can liquidate them quickly. My main concern is security. Thanks in advance!
"A couple of dumb questions:

1. On a computer wallet or on a ledger, can you store all sorts of coins on them? Or just bitcoin, ethereum and litecoin?

2. When moving your coins from an exchange or coinbase to a wallet or a paper wallet do you have to pay withdrawal fees?"
"This should be a sticky..
"
Bitstamp is pretty safe and trustworthy though, isn't it?
isn't the FAQ for that? is there a FAQ on this subreddit?
What about a wallet like Exodus? Is that relatively safe?
"I have coins on Binance.
What do?"
[deleted]
I only buy when bitcoin, or any of the coins i hold drop, and i try not to sell.   Ever.  
Not when they didn't exist at the time.
Same here!
"While Bitstamp is reputable, this does not mean it is invulnerable: it could suffer from a hacking attack, regulatory intervention, mismanagement, etc. -
 do not underestimate the uncertainty in this business. Any one of these issues could result in temporary or complete locking of accounts, and if your coins are there, you will have no control over when or if you see your coins again. At the very least you might have some sleepless nights and a lot of hassle getting them back."

"> 2. You can close the LN channel anytime you want.

You can *try* to close the channel anytime you want. Your channel partner can contest this and force the contract to timeout. In that case you may have to wait some period of time (a week?) before your channel closes, and then only if you can afford to fund the closing transaction at whatever the going fee is at closing time."
Thanks very much!  I will look into it more.
Like mining pooling / rewards from coins which offer masternode contracts?
"Thank you very much for all the info!
Can you recommend paper wallet generators for BTC, LTC, ETH and XRP? And, how do I get my coins from my paper wallet into an exchange (when/if I decide to sell) or transfer to someone else's wallet?"
The idea that you need a full node to secure your coins is poppycock. An SPV wallet is perfectly secure.
there are not many hardware wallets. ledger or trezor and they should provide a list of supported coins so not much digging around to do.
"That's me exactly..I have some of my coins like lumens in lumens wallet and Ether nd Tron in myetherwallet..bt all my other coins are still kept in multiple exchanges..
my question is how safe or unsafe is it to store coins on exchanges..? 
For me it makes life easier to transact later when they are kept on an exchange instead of stored in a wallet like ledger NS.."
Or... just use the local bank or credit union. 
"> How do I know if a wallet is a hosted wallet? Or if I'm the one who only know my private keys?

This is a pretty deep question - the short answer is that we aren't entirely sure with  some companies, and I suppose you can never be entirely sure. Unless you generate a private key completely offline. 

However, for the most part, we know that the open source code on hardware wallets generate the private key on the client side, and they are not shared with anyone. "
Well yes. But then the only way it a private key generated off line client side for a paper wallet, and even then, any software you use to transact could steal the private key. 
"I need to download a copy of my .JSON file. I remember when the brainwallet hype became a think and I added like I don't know a couple of thousands brainwallet phrased to my blockchain.info account in the hope that somebody somewhere in the future would choose the same one. I have downloaded that .JSON file before but I can't figure out the password anymore. Irony. There might be some of my own Bitcoin still on there, I just don't know. 

So websites that just store your seed encrypted .. they can still get hacked and if the hackers get your password ... they have the keys to the kingdom.
For that reason I make sure that any wallet of mine that is connected to the internet never goes above 100 USD in Bitcoin Cash before I transfer it either to my linux system or a paper wallet. "
"You get a backup seed for your PC wallet and/or hardware wallet. 

This backup seed can be written down on a piece of paper. 

You can then just delete the wallet from the computer if you want. 

The seed is usually comprised of 12 or 24 short words written in English.

If anything happens to your hardware like it breaks dropped in water, lost, etc, you then input your seed into another wallet and your coins will be there."
"> On a computer wallet or on a ledger, can you store all sorts of coins on them? Or just bitcoin, ethereum and litecoin?

There are many wallets available, some of them store only a single type of coin, and some of them all kinds. Hardware wallets like Ledger can store all kinds of coins. Note that wallets don't store coins as such, they store the private keys, so you will different private keys for each type of coin, and some wallets may generate lots of private keys, so in practice you will have lots of wallets. (E.g. Ledger generates a new receive wallet for every transaction).

> When moving your coins from an exchange or coinbase to a wallet or a paper wallet do you have to pay withdrawal fees?

Yes, and fees can be quite high, and transactions can be a bit slow, depending on exchange. Usually something like 0.005 ETH and 0.001 BCH / BTC."
"A ""paper"" wallet is very secure, if created securely :) The wallet is basically the private key. If that key was generated on a computer that was connected to the Internet, it is *possible* that the key is compromised. To be absolutely sure, you want to make a ""paper"" wallet on an offline machine that has never been connected to the Internet (or possibly compromised in any other way). Although a hassle, it is certainly possible. But also bear in mind that a hardware wallet is essentially a paper wallet protected from the Internet. Most people write down their seed phrase on a piece of paper - so in effect, the hardware wallet is only as safe as that piece of paper (but it can go online without risk). The level of paranoia you want, is going to be proportional to the amount of value tied up in your cryptocurrency. Tbh hardware wallets are very convenient if a little over priced IMO (I own a couple).

Also, any wallet you chose, make sure you test it (securely) with a small transfer (in and out) first. And remember online security is not your only concern. Loss of your ""paper"" keys (take a photo and store on memory sticks?) or your seed phrase can occur for a variety of shitty reasons, like common theft, accident loss, fire, etc. Keep secure backups in separate places."
"They're both good. Do some research to find out which supports the coins you want or which features / interface support your needs the best.

Amazon should be okay if you buy from Amazon itself (I wouldn't recommend a third-party Amazon seller), but the best is to buy direct.

And make sure you set up a new recovery phrase when you get it. If a printed phrase comes with it or a person ever tells you which phrase to use it's a scam. Write your phrase down, test that the restore works before putting your coins in it, and keep it safer than the device itself.

Edit: Spelling and punctuation."
"You can make a transaction that says something like ""you can only send this coin after x time."" Or ""you can only send this coin after x blocks have passed since this transaction was confirmed."" Something like that. 

This is more useful than it sounds, especially when chained with what other transaction types can be made. "
Are you actively trading? Or are you using Binance as a wallet? 
"Install linux on a thumb drive. Now you can load linux from almost any computer (if they allow you to boot from usb). Have the home folder encrypted. Make a copy of the thumb drive so you have two. Or just copy the thumb drive image to your computer. 

Now you can safely do all your ""banking"" from your linux thumb drive. Keep the linux OS up to date and don't install new programs on it other then the initial crypto programs that you need.  "

Due to the nature of eth and how changing it is, MEW is basically the only way to do things. If you want to be more secure, you can use MEW with a hardware wallet like a ledger s. 
It hadn't for a quite a while now. Has in the past, yes. 
I would say the chrome extensions do still work. What makes you think they don't?
Yes you should get a hardware wallet. 
A hardware wallet is different to a node wallet. 
"LocalMonero.co straight from seller. 

Withdraw straight to Shapeshift to get any other coin you want. 

Shapeshift pointed to your personal key controlled wallet. 

If you want other coins, i am afraid exchanges. Though EtherDelta is interesting, but a complete mindmelt. But, it does work. "
"Timelock contracts are not exclusive to Lightning Network and I didn't mention LN at all, specifically to avoid politicizing the issue, but it's true that coins in a Lightning channel are locked in a timelocked contract.

Not infrequently someone asks how to lock up coins for a specified period. I suppose there are good reasons to do that. While you retain the keys, it removes the coins from your control."
That's entirely sensible tbh. I use BC.i for spending money and a Ledger for hodling. 
"Concerted media slandering is what Ron Paul and Bernie Sanders went through. What Trump went through was an intentional Streisand effect.

I'll keep my mind open and base some searches off your comment. But what I've seen so far has all played into the hands of big corp. And nothing spectacular in his speeches.

As for the tax cuts, that just didn't hurt much enough for Wall Street, they decided to use that as an excuse to look hurt and make Trump seem like he was doing 'progress'. That's what I meant by smoke and mirrors. Just like the good things Obama did which were just intentionally enough and not more.

I was also into Ron Paul btw, but I wasn't particularly deep into anything political back then. But any candidate that speaks out against the banks with effort has my interest. Outside of that, not so much."
Thank you! This is a great idea :)
".... what? Dude the entire status quo is uniformly aligned against him. The tax cuts are terrible for the globalists and Wall St because they outsource all their shit to other countries , and with America being 12% cheaper rate now that is all at an end. 

I don't have time to google videos for you dude, but I absolutey promise you if you listen to a full speech of his there is plenty about tearing down the crooks on wall st etc. 

His early campaign speeches about NATO, TPP, China, IMF, all of it is squarely and purely anti establishment 

He has faced the most concerted media slandering in history precisely because he is tearing down the status quo.

Disclaimer:  I'm an old school (2008) Ron Paul audit the fed kinda guy, I have no incentive to defend trump, just telling you the truth: he is 100% against the establishment. Is he full on end the fed? No. But he sure as hell ain't gonna print 3 trillion a year like Obama did."
"""Fallacies galore"".

Then it should be easy to name one and identify one.

""...unless I've understood fundamental things on this subject incorrectly.""

That would hardly be abnormal. If anything, when it comes to this subject, that is the norm.

I hope you'll remain curious and explore it more in the future."
"> he literally turned establishment finance into his enemy with his speeches and rhetoric.

LOL

> Remember the Wall St people crying about the tax cuts saying how bad they would be??

Yeah they would cry so much about tax cuts wouldn't they, lmao. It doesn't matter shit to them compared to staying in comfortably in their seats. It's smoke and mirrors.

> You've already made the choice to believe otherwise though, so I doubt you will change your mind. 

You'll change my mind if you show me anything Trump has said that would piss the establishment off. There is none though (not gonna lie though, you will change my mind if you reveal some hidden truth on this to me), because he never pissed the establishment off, he and the establishment are jerking each other off right now as we speak. You can't deny that. Watch what is happening."
Always am. You too. As for the fallacies, effort. I suggest reading through your own posts and seeing, I'm sure you aren't making them intentionally since you're asking me to point them out.
Fallacies galore. Sorry, I'm having a hard time seeing a grounded discussion here.  And I'm having a hard time seeing where some of the things you're saying are based on, it just doesn't appear based on reality, unless I've understood fundamental things on this subject incorrectly.
