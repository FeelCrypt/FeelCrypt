I'm not sure that is correct.  If you start with 1000 pre-fork you end up with 1000 BTCWIN and 1000 BTCLOS post-fork.

Therefore the winner will have 1000 BTCWIN coins and the loser will have 1000 BTCLOS coins."
"Indeed. I think the gloves will come off on the side of the miners, however.

Just look at the salt over on rBitcoin. This time, the miners mean it. Collectively. And I am pretty sure that the increasing screeching and frequency of attacks from Core will not make the miners less likely to turn the 1x Shitcoin into what it needs to be: Bitcoin Ash."
There is a cost of opportunity. One side will be worth less than the other, in which case you would get more profits from selling the share you don't believe in.
Rather: Roger wants more BTC, and the others want CSC. (Core ShitCoin)
Sure, but there's still got to be some sort of escrow. Say the fork comes, immediately one of the forks is trading for a fraction of the price of the other, you really think if there's no sort of escrow that the participants of the trade who have to give up the more valuable fork will actually do so?

Trezor is BIP39/44. We are fine. 
It’s not up to users to “keep their coins” safe with segwit...
"> Did it occur to you that the cost of attack increases with user base?

It does not. Number of non-full node users does not increase the cost of any known attack. It reduces the cost of many attacks, such as trust based attacks compromising the full nodes that large numbers of SPV users rely on. When one computer can be targeted to attack thousands of users, that's an increase in centralization and a degradation of the security of those users.

Again, a very basic technical misunderstanding being played off as subjective politics. This isn't philosophy where anything can be argued as a correct answer, it's network properties. Thankfully bitcoin will succeed whether you understand it, whether you fork it, and whether you politicize the environment. Bitcoin possesses the most unique network property in the world in decentralization and so long as it does it will have value.

Paypal has value too. Make a paypal. I wouldn't dare discourage it especially since I get a cut, but I'm not going to let you fuck up my bitcoin."
Whose 'they',  x2 has one fucking developer. 
"I think it is rather: Core thinks they have a strong-enough stranglehold on the Bitcoin community and especially also the Bitcoin *brand* that they can basically do whatever they please and get their shittokens listed as BTC. Including an ""emergency POW fork"".

But I actually think enough smart money has read the whitepaper and understands it - to know that Bitcoin is not *Core*, but *decentralized*, and that the miners play the key role here.

And the Bitcoin world is bigger than /r/Bitcoin, BCT and the github.

I am willing to put money on the line here this time as well. (And I didn't do any trading of BTC:BCH)."
I have 1000 BTC. You have 1000 BTC. 2000 BTC total. After the fork, I have 1000 BTC-A + 1000 BTC-B. You have the same. Total of 2000 BTC-A + 2000 BTC-B between us. I give you my 1000 BTC-B, you give me your 1000 BTC-A. I now have 2000 BTC-A. You now have 2000 BTC-B.
"Totally irrelevant, it's a voluntary trade. If you regret doing it after the fact doesn't mean you ""lost""."

I'm quite confident at least of 4 of them would.
Isn't it interesting that the only people who feel the need to scare people into taking their side are small block supporters?
"The Bitcoin Unlimited/nchains [Gigablocks](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/730r8x/nchaincom_gigablock_initiative/)  project is spending 1.5 Million over 5 years to test 1GB blocks.
"
I am interested in this as well.
"I hope no one engages in those tactics and there's no proof Core/Blockstream devs participated in them before (sans smear campaigns).

Todd has said some questionable things though:

>Get in touch with me before you decide to offer a reward or anything for
actually making an attack happen... You have the support of a core dev
FWIW, I'm sure you can guess who. Warren of Litecoin says he believes
you as well, and asks you try the attack on a smaller alt-coin. :P
 
>Strategy would be good here, especially because the same attack(s) can
be used to take down the whole network too, but we more want to show how
SPV specifically is bad. Implementing a darknet to resist network-wide
attack is easily done, and it looks like doing peer prioritization will
help for those for whome darknets aren't a good option. Some testing of
the latter prior to an attack would be good.

"Keep your BTC on a wallet where you control the keys, split the coins when you get the opportunity (manage your personal risk here, make sure you're not the first person attempting to split)

As soon as both tickers get onto any exchange, you should be able to change 1 into the other with silly North Corea 1x shills swapping the other way.  

As an example, I swapped a bunch of my BTC into BCH on Kraken pretty early on (back when BCH was around $200)."
"well if there's two chains after the fork yes, you'll hold both chains, but if one chain dies, those coins will be worthles.

for example, if bitcoin cash had died on arrival then you would still have had the bitcoin cash but they'd have been useless without a network and miners to grow the chain. "
Trezor is amazing. Their wallet is rock solid and they did a great job w/ BCH IMO. They called it BCash which upset some people but their support of it has been great.
Can you explain what is wrong with Bitcoin today? 
You didn't answer the question I asked. Did the exchanges agree?
There are no exchanges among signatories or they are powerless regarding BTC ticker. See Shapeshift's tweets - they will assign BTC to the winning chain (by MCap) after the fork (weeks?).
And the rest will fall in line, despite all the talk to the contrary. The beauty of Nakamoto consensus.

Let's be clear. 1x *can't* implement replay protection. That creates a new alt, 1.5x, 1xb or something.
The PoW hardfork is suicide, they dug their grave for 1x with that one.  They'd have more success going along with 2x at the last minute, then hard fork atomic swaps or lightning or something actually interesting.
Lightning has ALWAYS been “18 months from ready” since I’ve known of it. This goes back many years. 
[deleted]
This is why I like bitcoin cash. It's already free of all this mess. Sure they (core trolls) can try and call red green until they're blue in the face (bcash) but you can't piss on my head and say it's raining.... I'm sure they'll try the same thing this time round.
"Exactly, but by the end of October it'll be patiently clear to everyone just how much support 2x has, which for some reason they're not believing right now, lol.

Cultism is a hell of a drug."
I'm sure u trust /u/MemoryDealers perhaps he can setup a 2X escrow? And /u/coblee can do the same for core? 
"Don't think smart contracts would work. Weird things like POW changes may happen between now and then.

There will be DDOS attacks, hacking attempts against SW2x supporting businesses and smear campaign on r/bitcoin and BCT. We've seen it before haven't we?
No, valid hash rate (read Core).
"I agree that it's a smart bet.

With 90+% hashpower holding for months now, it is exceedingly likely that segwit2x is going to roll out without a hitch. The legacy chain will die, and Roger will double the bitcoins he bet. And, to make it an even better bet, the other side seems to be allowing everyone to get their bets back if there is no hardfork at all. I guess the people betting against Roger aren't just bad at economics, they're bad at gambling too."
"if you hold btc at the time of the fork you will then hold 1mb segwit coin and 2mb segwit coins after the fork, just like the bitcoin cash fork
but you need to possess the private keys so your trezor should be fine"
[deleted]
That's a little naive. Exchange customers will demand both coins. It will be easier for an exchange to add segwit2X as a new pair than to modify BTC for segwit 2x and create a new pair for bitcoin core.
1x should be called Bcore
"Is it going to be like this:

- trading stops before the fork
- Segwit2x gets 95% hashrate
- trading starts with BTC as Segwit2x

?

Is this what Core is expecting:

- Announcement before the fork by non-NYA: Core keeps BTC ticker
- Core gets 15% hashrate after the fork (if less than that than emergency difficulty adjustment)
- BTC trades higher than S2X (if listed)
- Miners switch to the most profitable chain

?

"
Is that actually part of the agreement?  Which exchanges agreed to that? 
I really hope you are right. We all may have to hodl on tight because it could be a bumpy ride.

"> ndMe! 1 month, how is Charlie Lee trying to weasel out of the bet with Roger.

FYI the fork isn't until November."
so... ethereum???
What short term future do you see for Ethereum? And do you think alt coins will primarily compete or complement? 
"As long as community creates new forks from BTC and not from BCH or B2X or BTG, it is clear that BTC is considered the ""true"" Bitcoin.

Obviously, some people want to fork BTC into so many pieces until all of the fragments, individually, are negligible. This is how to destroy the network effect - quite devilish!

Thanks Roger in playing a leading role in destroying Bitcoin - you are doing JP Morgan and friends a great service!  "
When you say altcoins, do you mean everything thats not BTC or is BCH included?
"> And if a PoW HF doesn't happen and there's just the 2x HF and the segwit no HF chain, which is the one changing again? Clearly 2x. I.E. bitcoin and a bitcoin fork.

I am willing to bet lots (from my POV) of money, *a significant fraction of my net worth* on 2x being BTC and 1x being Bitcoin Ash. As in, likely not even existing after the fork.

> If bitcoin PoW changes you have at least a stronger argument about the brand as it's fork vs fork.

Glad to see a speck of common sense here, however small it might be (I could now complain about fork vs. fork but I know how my argument there would be lost on you)."
If you believe in big blocks and want to profit wouldn't it make more sense to buy bitcoin cash and then let core keep bitcoin at 1x? In the long run bigger blocks will win according to your thesis. Since it hasn't happened yet doesn't 2x mean it will take years for bitcoin cash to gain traction? The biggest impetus towards bitcoin cash is full blocks on bitcoin and now that won't happen any time soon.
"Roger would you mind elaborating why you're so bullish on Bitcoin Cash vs SegWit2x?

 After way more bitcoin miners, business and developers seem focus on SegWit2x. Furthermore, it's still unclear to me how many and how competent the developers behind Bitcoin Cash is. 
I've only really seen presentations and interviews of Amaury Séchet. 
How is the development funded? "
"Says redditor for two months who has nothing but shit posts on r/btc. 

Some of us have been around Bitcoin more than a few years. It's probably the first time you've seen it so here is the whitepaper: https://bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf

First sentence:
>A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online
payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. 

That's called economic freedom buddy. That's what Bitcoin is. Freedom from corporations like Blockstream, freedom from central planners like BitcoinCore and freedom from central government authorities. It's pretty simple."
I dare say it is you that is brainwashed. 
"> lets free everybody, 20000000000000000000000000000000x block weight

Sounds good to me. Remove the centrally planned block size limit entirely, and let the Nakamoto Consensus sort it out.

Hopefully Segwit2x is the first step in a series of block size limit increases that eventually lead to the entire removal of the limit."
"> the ""general public"" doesn't even know what Bitcoin is ... They just look at the price and move on with their day.

Which is fine, as long as there's only one price to look at. The problem arises when you tell them ""OK, now there are four Bitcoins ... which one do you wish to invest in?"".

Let's also not forget that we were all part of the general public before we got into Bitcoin."
2x has opt in replay protection. I guess HWs will provide a how to split guide which will start with sending 2x coins to new scheme.
The same as when the BCC fork occurred. You'll just have to be very careful on how you split your tokens, I think.
Ideally 1x will be abandoned by everyone. But if 1x implements replay protection during their PoW hardfork, which is looking more and more likely, then the coins will split and be spendable on both chains.
There are benefits to segwit that BCH doesn't have. 
"Some people feel that way, others don't. There are reasonable arguments on both sides. The only sure thing is that popcorn sales are set to rise.

>
> After way more people, business and developers seem focus on fiat. Furthermore, it's still unclear to me how many and how competent the developers behind Bitcoin are."
"That depends on the roadmap that is put forth for scaling the Segwit2x/BTC chain.

I'd guess if they don't move beyond a static blocksize limit, or put forth a schedule of planned increases or some conditions triggering those, then Bitcoin Cash presents a more ambitious on-chain ""space program"" which could be attractive to bigger players.

Let's remember - Lightning network is supposedly 18 months from being ready. That's a looooong time."
"That is a good question and the truth is that a successful 2x keeps BCC on the back-burner. However, sooner or later, 2x is not enough and the fight is had all over again and it may turn out that the segwit part is a dead weight that does nobody any favors.

I'm a BCC fan but I think that 2x does have a fighting chance so I'm holding both for now. Segwit is a wart but not a death sentence."
"> Of course it is, but those economic incentives aren't ""put it in as many hands as possible to increase its value at the cost of the protocols unique technical attributes"", the economic incentives are the cost to attack the network and the nash equilibrium encouraging honest nodes Roger is perpetually trying to change in favor of usability and access to blockspace.

Did it occur to you that the cost of attack increases with user base?

A lot more than with full node count, mind you, *as users are incentivized to keep their coins safe!*

Also, there's not a single hint that node count will be lower with higher node load but also larger adoption rates.

> His actions are clearly motivated by greed.

You got that right. Mine are as well. And collectively, this is also why Bitcoin will succeed."
I think 2x means BTC will scale on chain as well, and massively so, eventually. 2x will be the ousting of Core. Before the advent of BCH on the stage, this was also the common understanding here. I guess BCH changed the dynamics for some (and I can't blame them).
"Well, that's pretty clear from my reading of the bet.

All parties put their BTC into escrow before the fork.  After the fork, the 2X coins from the escrow go to Roger and the Core/1X coins go the the other participants."
ah gotcha.  The details are sure to come out soon.  This is going to garner a lot of attention for sure.
"Hmm.. so right out of the gate eh?  Wow that's pretty bold.  

I personally think the fork falls thru and doesn't happen.  There certainly is no shortage of drama in bitcoin eh?"
"It doesn't matter.

They are swapping 1x for 2x at a 1 to 1 ratio.

They are agreeing to this now before any other market price has been determined.

They will either kill their reputation or be stuck with that price and they will win or lose depending on how they are valued compared to each other.

So there is no need for an official winner, it's just each side showing confidence in their preferred chain
"
notarized!
Mining 1 block on the other chain to make sure there is a fork is cheaper than 1,000 BTC so this is a lot of incentive to cause a chain split.
On the other hand, if it looks like their preferred chain is going to be abandoned: the have an incentive to claim that there is no fork (so they get to keep their coins).
"Right, but they will be divesting themselves of the asset they don't want by  swapping coins 1-for-1.  If their preferred chain ends up being worth much more than the other, they do much better than they could have done by exchanging the coins on the open market.  If their preferred chain ends up being worth much less, then they end up doing very badly.

That's the bet.

EDIT: To put figures to it.  Imagine that post fork the winning chain (lets call it BTCWIN) is worth $5,000 and the losign chain let's call it BTCLOS is worth $500.  So if you have 1000 coins pre-fork (and therefore 1000 of each post fork) then you have a portfolio woth $5.5m.

If you take this bet, and are on the winning side, you end up with 2000 BTCWIN coins - a portfolio worth $10m.

If you take this bet, and are on the losing side, you end up with 2000 BTCLOS coins - a portfolio wirth $1m."
As long as he broadcasts the transaction he has done all he can.  If the network can't process it that is not his fault.  If they don't get their coins because the network is crap or attacked then it is their own fault.  Personally, I hope there is only one valid chain post the split - the 2x chain.   But ideally, the 1X chain would hold long enough for all these people to sell off their 2x and move entirely to 1x and then 1x dies with fire.  Really hope Jihan, Mcafee and others tear it down as harshly and ruthlessly as possible - if it was me, I would show absolutely no mercy to these turds - enough is enough - it would be worth spending millions in the short term to purge them because in the long term far more value will be created without them. They have tried to hijack the coin and they have no right to do so - absolutely none - what they have done is simply heinous. Problem with these miners is that they are too nice and soft and too patient - if they believe so strongly that 2x is the right way to go, then make it happen.  If people don't like it, fork off and change the POW. 
How the fuck is yet another fork, with one developer going to beat bitcoin. You're all deluded. 
You can't lose on this trade. It's a trade, not a bet. Roger doesn't want his BTC but he does want B2X, the others don't want B2X but they do want BTC. Win-win.
I'd argue public figures' worth is their word. If they do renege, then they aren't worth listening to. Exciting!

You know? I disagree here. When it was first announced, I wasn't at all sold on the idea of Bitcoin Cash, but as things have progressed I've increasingly realised it's the best insurance policy we could ever hope to have. If 2x fails, I'm pretty confident some big players will shift their weight towards it.

And crypto is far from dependent on bitcoin at this point. Ethereum has caught the business world's eye, and Monero will continue being a solid crypto with its feet well grounded on earth. And I said, BCC can more than sufficiently carry on with bitcoin's legacy for the needed uses of a public ledger.

If I were a small blocker who only visited the other sub, where the news of a shitty Mexican bitcoin startup reneging on the NYA is posted everyday for a week with the title ""the SW2x plan is crumbling to pieces!"", at this point so far off from the fork, I might feel confident that during this time things would continue going that way, and I might be willing to posture by making a ridiculous public bet like this. After all, the BlockStream Boys® have invested far more money into their plan, and they have satellites and shit! And whenever /u/nullc speaks or posts, he doesn't leave any doubts that he's convinced this is a) going to happen, and b) that the silent masses clearly and obviously support him (can't say the same for /u/adam3us, unfortunately, he's just not a good bluffer or particularly savvy with people). This all looks pretty bullish for CoreCoin from that perspective, so betting 250BTC doesn't seem like a bet, but more like a way to get those stupid zealots to give up their BTC in exchange for their ""BCash 2"".

But one week out from the fork? With miner signalling still over 90%, and the large exchanges holding their support? I'd be getting pretty nervous, and I 100% expect they'll all be trying to weasel out of the bet.

I wonder then if they all end up losing 1MM$ each due to being misled by the BlockStreamers, whether they'll perhaps seek reparations from them, once it comes to light just how empty and big a bluff they were engaging in with the community, and misleading everyone with their patently false revisionist views of the incentives mechanisms and governance forces that dictate the functioning of bitcoin? /u/coblee"
"> Is btc going to cease to exist?

If you cannot answer this question yourself, I hope you have not invested any significant amount of your fiat. 

It depends on what you define as Bitcoin (I am not using ""btc: to discuss, neither should you). How do you define Bitcoin? 

If you define Bitcoin as only that chain that is supported by the Blockstream/Core developers, then IMO, yes, it might cease to exist.

If you define Bitcoin as the longest chain of most PoW, then Bitcoin Core might cease to exist, or become a minority chain.

Or, something else entirely.

> Or is this just a fork like bcc

It is not. There are some pretty obvious major differences. Can you name a few?

"If I remember (and I do not use hardware wallets) it took a few days for trezor to release software (firmware?) that allowed the splitting of the tokens.

This time I believe that because SegWit2x is not including replay protection then each user will need to do perform their due diligence in splitting their tokens on each chain.

I am hoping that someone will provide a how to (for QT based wallets) prior to the fork so immediately after the fork I can divest myself of the minority chain and purchase more BCC."

The exchanges will say that the overwhelming majority of users (nodes) do not support 2X and that 2X is a miners'/corporate takeover. POW change (if necessary) doesn't make bitcoin less bitcoin.

Blockstream has money, power, connections and is probably also using dirty methods (DDOS, threat, bribe, pay for shilling...) to achieve their goals. They are powerful."

I suspect that the exchanges then also open themselves up to massive litigation, as the only reasonable definition of Bitcoin that would actually hold up in court is based on mining SHA256 POW.

Core doing an 'emergency POW change' is Core saying that they are somehow special. And if they are special, are they suddenly the issuers of the coin, and thus liable?

They might try and one or two exchanges might flip or posture. But I doubt it will be all, and I think that exchange will be in a world of hurt afterwards.

I don't doubt that. They're still going to lose this time, though.

More value when? Immediately after the split? A month later?
Careful if you lose Roger, these people already don't want to pay for SegWit.
Wait are they actually being millions of dollars or is this a joke? Wow
"That's technically not a bet, it's a trade. 

Anyhow those guys are going to lose 1 million each."
Lol. You are going to regret that bet. Don't be stupid.
Wow u lost 4 mil buddy.
"Inb4 Charlie Lee was ""joking"""
"That is such a good bet.

It wouldn't have even been fair if you gave them 10-1.

I wonder home many 1xer's will dump their 2x coins, like Erik had the conviction to do with Bitcoin Cash."
I tried to make a similar bet (at much lower stakes) with /u/smartfbrankings, but he and /u/bruce_fenton ghosted me after this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6vansd/a_refusal_to_implement_replay_protection_on_the/dm0lvy7/?context=3
"All we can see on Twitter is that you agreed to to swap your BTC for Charlies's 2X coins after the HF in Nov.  
Nothing about any bet on value.
"
You're a friend of individual liberty, thanks for fighting the good fight!
What I love about Roger - he puts his money where his mouth is.  Unlike North Corea...
"Is there a way to do the same bet for us smaller guys? I am thinking of betting around a thousandth of what you bet, and I think there's a lot more of us willing to bet in that range.
"
I am a small player and I want to do this too (I have BTC now and want to trade my S1X for S2X coins)!  I want S2X coins!  Is it possible for someone to write a smart contract to do this for us?  To act as escrow?
I going to make sure that you /u/MemoryDealers win that bet! I'm not going to hold Segwit 1x coin.
Holy cow, now we're talking, money squarely in mouth. Bet Charlie's gettin' nervous.
this gon be gud
"What I find interesting is Roger's promoting of ""Bitcoin"" Cash has actually undermined the support of Segwit2x.

If we have 3 coins, Bitcoin Cash is the natural competitor to Segwit2x. If Segwit2x beats Core, Bitcoin Cash will also lose."
"Way to make some easy cash.

How long do the participants wait before determining the winner?"
"Daily reminder that the only sane thing to do is hold BTC, BCH, and Segwit 2x.  Don't sell your free hedge.

No one can predict the future. Not Roger Ver, the retards at /r/bitcoin, the retards here, me, or you. "
"What happens if the 1MB fork turns out to be Mircea Popescu's ""The Real Bitcoin"", which does not support segwit?

IMO, his camp has more to lose in a 2x fork."
Well if there's a split I'll simply hold both this time. 
What's the time line? Is it the day of the split or a certain amount of time later for the market to settle? 
How about small blockers merge 2X in a few weeks if they feel they'll lose the bet? Maybe that's why they took the bet (no risk).
Guys....important question.  Is this a bet it a swap?  Can we get this posted online somewhere the details?
[deleted]
Shouldn't it be the other way around, he gives you SegWit2x coins if they are worth more?
another proof that you have serious mental disease problems
Holy sheeet! I'd tip you, but you already have enough money!
AHAHA take them to the cleaners! I would have taken that bet too 
"You should program that into a smart contract on the BCH chain

Oh wait you can’t "
What happens if 1x coin has not enough hashrate and Core hardforks to alter PoW/difficulty? Only Original 1x (non PoW hardwork) coins required as payment?
Good
Good for you.
"I have seen multiple times that those BCore followers break promise/contract. They have no/little skin in Bitcoin.

Anyway, you only waste some time by replying those trolls."
Awesome! Thank your for your kind contribution to Core developers funding.
Other free coins I am going to dump right away..
Careful. Lee will back out like the lying scammer he is.
I need to figure out a way to accumulate 1,000 bitcoin.
You're crazy , in a good way but still crazy. Do you just love gambling or are that bullish? 
"Two thoughts on this.

First, how is this set up technically? How do you avoid the scenario where one party sends first, then the other reneges? Is there a way to do it as an atomic swap or trade of some kind?

Second, how would other people get in on this kind of trade? I certainly don't have 1000 BTC lying around, but I do have a goodly amount I'd consider risking. Is this being set up as an open pool, or a private deal between ""name-brand"" players?"
What are the specific terms? For example, how will the value of 2x coin be determined - and when?
Prediction: at least one of those 4 will back out of the bet and not pay! Roger you should really get some kind of notary / 3rd party involved to hold the funds and distribute them to the winner
Have the community have a look at the conditions before agreeing. It would be very easy to sneak in some really bad terms.
Isnt sw2x coded to be 80% hashpower? And nobody pays if there is no fork? If that is the case... Seems like a good bet.
[deleted]
2 weeks after fork? 4 weeks after?
So when shall we expect Segwit4x4?
Then bet your money. No one cares but you. I personally bet that decentralization as a network property has value and I will follow it anywhere by any name. No one cares what I think has value any more than they care what you think has value, I just want the right to exist without the constant us vs them absolutism coming out of the forked camps and the bullshit lies spread as propoganda coming out of people like you.
[deleted]
I think the BTC ticker will be with Segwit 2X per the NYA.
RemindMe! 1 month, how is Charlie Lee trying to weasel out of the bet with Roger. 
"> how they weasel out of the deal.

The deal needs a on x time limit or segwit2x block height."
Wow, this is a quick way to lose money.  
"> You would like to risk one (1!) Bitcoin?

At least. It depends a lot on counterparty risk.  And I am not a rich guy ..."
I'll look into it, thanks!
Damn Roger you will go in history not as Bitcoin Jesus but Bitcoin Chuck Norris!!! Go win it all and convert it to BCH after hahaa.))))) 
Thanks for clarifying.
This looks like a PR stunt from all involved sides. Coins in escrow or GTFO
He was in the game quite early.
In the long run I am even more bullish on BCC than Segwit 2x, but the real winner in the Bitcoin scaling civil war has already been, and will continue to be alt coins. 
Patrick McCorry's [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCE2OzKIab8&t=9233s) at Breaking Bitcoin was about just this idea.
Smart contracts only work with a fixed data sets so right, someone should create such a blockchain.
Nah bro we have them satellites and Lukejr. No need to complicate things. 
"Newsflash: Bitcoin is *based* upon economic incentives.

Ignore them at your own peril.
"
WE swap to BTC2x , there's no future in BCH... 
That's not brave. That's a smart bet.
Should one be worried about holding bitcoins in a Trezor at the time of the fork?
Don't underestimate the power of spv wallets. They'll automatically follow the majority hash rate
"Peter Todd had the following to say on the SegWit2x mailing list today. Interpret it as you will:  

*""You can probably guess that many talented developers will fight against this attack.""* - Peter Todd, 30 September 2017."
"> It is being discussed by email now.

Hope you get the terms finalized in writing, with proper signatures on them. And I hope you win! :-)"
"
Please agree a timestamp where the value of both chains will be measured, and share publicly."
"How long do the participants wait before determining the winner?

1 week?

1 month?

Also, you may want to have a trusted escrow to ensure they pay out."
How can you stand communicating with those shits? 
He should still come out ahead if he is on the winning side of the bet
"Segwit2x developer is obviously more centralised... being 1 person, likely more compromised.



"
So in other words, something to motivate them even HARDER at trying to FUD their way to abandonment.  :(
"That just the initial terms, right?

Or... wait...

* If there is a 1x / 2x fork, each side gets all of their preferred version of the coins.

This would mean that each party would simply be divesting themselves of the tokens that they do not ""support"".

Uhmmm... ok.

Edit: the more I think about this the more complicated this bet is. Will the tokens (I assume Bitcoin Core tokens) be placed in escrow before the hard fork and then the winner(s), we'll assume you, is then able to split the tokens into their respective chain tokens?"
is that supposed to be the cut off date?
[deleted]
"Lol, the ""general public"" doesn't even know what Bitcoin is, much less care about some little feud about it. I'd bet most people who hold Bitcoin don't even know about these hard-forks. They just look at the price and move on with their day.

These forks really don't effect anything. Nothing can stop progress. If BTC is strangled, people will move on to the next crypto making progress."
I don't think so, I just think he is wrong.
It beats blowing it all in a day in a casino
You have no idea what his finances are like
Anyone with 250 BTC at its current price is wealthy.
I also share your future vision of only large banks being able to sell access to an astronomically large hosted big block blockchain. In fact, 2x is way to conservative, lets free everybody, 20000000000000000000000000000000x block weight, to the moon!
Jesus, you're totally brainwashed, aren't you?
[deleted]
Any way to ensure they pay up, or just going to be their word? Because if they end up losing (they will), I don't put it past them to renege.
What defines a fork? This provides an incentive for one side to trigger a doomed hf after the hf is otherwise abandoned. 
Doesn't matter, they're just going to exchange 1x coins for 2x coins regardless
WTF you talking about, S1X and S2X don't exist yet, the fork has not happened yet.  This is betting against a future event and requires the use of a trusted escrow agent.  There are no exchanges that can handle this,.
Both of us are betting that the coins we are receiving after the fork will be worth more than the ones that we are giving up.  That is how a bet works.
He's also a sit down kind of good boy.
Bitshares allows betting on stuff like this doesn’t it?
You would like to risk one (1!) Bitcoin?
I will personally do a trade with you if you'd like?? It's f you put up 100 BTC I will put up 100 2x and we can swap. Let me know if interested. 
250 BTC is the only BTC he has. He's not particularly wealthy.
"It's funny, the crypto community outside of bitcoin is calling this guy an idiot for blowing so much money. 

I am too, Charlie is going to come out the winner here of course"
Cuz Roger Ver is a cia mole whose goal is to kill Bitcoin from the inside by divide and conquer
"Still, Segwit2X is still a win of sorts as we get get to purge the compromised, centralized developers from the system once 1X burns.  

It would be nice for 2X to then compete against Bitcoin Cash based on merits and adoption.  May the true Bitcoin win!
"
There is a risk that the total value after the split may be lower than now.
"It is being discussed by email now.
It looks like it will be:

* If there is a 1x / 2x fork, each side gets all of their preferred version of the coins.
* If there is no fork, everyone gets back all of their coins."
"Don't forget [Bitcoin Gold](https://www.coindesk.com/first-cash-now-gold-another-bitcoin-hard-fork-way/) (another fork occurring on October 25th).

To the general public, these endless forks make Bitcoin look like a joke and, as Roger said, the only winners from all this are alt-coins."
"But 2x is going to be BTC for all who understood the whitepaper and Bitcoin.

This is our chance to take money from the brainwashed."
RemindMe! 2 months
this guy is lunatic, Everyone know this.
"The fork is going to occur around November 18th, give or take a few days.

I just set the reminder about 2 weeks later just to be safe."
When you win, please consider supporting my crypto startup with your winnings. I am pro bitcoin cash and ethereum.
No no, he's swapping charlie's BTC for his 1x coins
"> At the same time I sell my existing 250 S1X and buy 250 S2X on an exchange somewhere.

That's where you are not understanding the bet correctly. One side of the chain will worth more. It's just no one knows which side and thus the bet."
"Well this is not a bet it is an exchange... Sorry but this is really misleading.

A bet would be situation with winner takes all and loser looses all. "
...and every trade is kind of a bet.
mental disease problems? bro, do you even English?
*Squee!*
RemindMe! 2 months
Charlie is a stand up guy. You don't have a clue 
"I think it is a very safe and smart bet, actually. If there would be a trusworthy site to do this kind of exchange of 1x shitcoins to 2x Bitcoins, I will change some of mine as well. (I don't have anywhere near that amount of BTC unfortunately, though ...)

And I am usually not a player. I usually do not bet. On this, I feel cocksure for once."
"> What are the specific terms? For example, how will the value of 2x coin be determined - and when?

By the markets... when they list them.

But the value they are deciding on for the terms of this bet is 1:1.  So 1 btc == 1 CoreCoin"
That is a [common pattern.](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/72ruuz/when_core_client_developers_threaten_to_rage_quit/dnkz9hf/)
I'm betting on no fork
1 to 1 is what I saw
"🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥      elevated_mind gave NO FUCKs      🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

If 2x isn't > 1x immediately it's a poor trade, as he could just sell 1000 1x BTC and aqcuire more than 1000 2x BTC. He's betting that exchanges will favor 2x, and 2x be the defacto BTC and price discovery will initially have 1x BTC lower 
That's the 24,000 dollar question.  They'll be worth more as of when?
"Well, I like to see MP against Ver and the rest of us. I am quite sure that his idea of ""no changes ever ""will be washed away.
"
[removed]
They are agreeing on a future trade, without knowing what the price will be. It is a kind of a bet.
"I hope /u/MemoryDealers has a clause in there that awards him the BTC then.

Because I really want to see some more salt from the smallblockers now."
hang about... surely if there is only the 2xchain you should get all the coins and if there is only the 1xchain they should get all yours...
