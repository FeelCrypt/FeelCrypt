"This is such a dumb comment.

$3 for a business is unspendable?

Yeah because that's all they'd receive in their address?"
"I think my comment completely went over your head, not in a dickish way....just think the logic your using is very flawed.

If your a business your going to have more sales, hence you'll have more of a balance than $3 eventually so you can move it wherever and cash out.  

If a business is using crypto they probably aren't cashing out every day obviously."
$3 is unspendable because even if they received $3 (which they can't) they could never send that $3 because fees are like $20. So yes, that $3 is literally worthless

I have 19,000 EUR transferred to their bank but not credited to my account since 1 month plus now. However looks like I'm getting some help since today. So there is hope.
For the sake of argument, let's say that he *does* have 34,000 in liquid assets available to comfortably risk on crypto.  In this scenario, is it fair for him to expect CEX.io to fulfill the transaction that they accepted and agreed to, and then fight like hell if they don't?
"Well, you are that guy. You have no idea how that 34k got to be 34k. 

It could have been $1000(which isn’t an unreasonable amount for ANYONE to have on an exchange) on December 15th, and he made the right bet that overnight mooned. And he is taking the 34k out because of exactly what you’re describing. 

"
check my original thread. I requested for the withdrawal on 16 December 2017 and it has been hell ever since. to date, it has been 32 days.
i was never aggressive, i just want my money back but no one from cexio would talk to me. 
cex.io is incorporated in UK so this applies to them. most commonwealth countries has stat demand laws

"OP, for some reason I got -5 or -6 on my comment, I am reposting this so you are made aware of the past CEX.io scams. 

Here was my comment.

cex.io has always scammed

Back when they sold hashing power for mining they released a futures market on hashing ppwer, which completly tanked hashing power price per ghz by over 50% within 12 hours and more than 90% over a few days. So what happened is that EVERYONE who bought hashing power and was cloud mining with CEX got completely f'ed and lost big time. There were people who don't pay attention every day to their cloud mining and they logged in days later to find they lost 90% due to the release of mining futures.

They gave no notice to this happening. People collectively lost hundreds of thousands of bitcoins due to this, CEX was a pretty big mining operation. Fast forward to today and they reopen and rebrand as an exchange and nobody is the wiser apparently.

i lost 40% of 9 btc back then in one day due to their futures bullshit. i got out same day luckily. They basically did it because something with not having the mining power/making their own money back for themselves(because it caused the price per GHZ to crash 90% and everyone sold out of their GHZ back to them). Then they made a killing on the mining futures they released becuase the futures were directly betting against hashing power(kind of like shorting hashing power per ghz price).

Did they ever get prosecuted for that bullshitery? anyone know? As far as I am aware nothing ever happened to them and not many people talked about it for some reason.

To add to that, the CEO admitted they didn't even have mining hardware tnat that it was 3rd party the whole time, AND they admitted they turned of people's mining and didn't turn it back on(you had to manually do it).

https://cointelegraph.com/news/interview-with-cexios-jeffrey-smith-on-why-they-paused-mining-and-the-future-of-the-industry



""Smith tells me that CEX has no hardware of their own, and everything traded on their exchange occurs through third-party hardware companies that have chosen to remain nameless. That isn't so much of a revelation as much as it is a fact that went unnoticed by many. The knowledge likely won’t quiet those who are complaining about a perceived lack of transparency. The website’s cloud mining page says nothing about hardware being held by third parties.

Really, nothing has changed for end users. If you own GHS, you can simply turn it back on and continue using the hashing power as you were before. People may feel as though CEX is looking to profit off those who don't bother to turn their GHS back on, but for the individual who is fearful that CEX is trying to get one up on them, the solution is to simply to turn it back on."""
I've used Bitstamp for years and have got fiat in and out without issue many times.
openledger/bitshares DEX. they have a way to deposit fiat now.
Hard to say especially if you are looking for the same features as Cex.io had alts & margin trading. The only thing that comes close is Kraken but they've been having technical problems on their platform which I'm not sure if they have fixed yet. I personally use Bitstamp cause I think they are the safest being the oldest & most established with yearly audits. But Gemini is good as well I hear with low trading fees. I don't do margin trading so for me Bistamp has been enough. For alts I just use smaller exchanges. 
thanks for this, i just fixed it. 
Yeah it reeks of incompetence and a lack of care for the client, but probably hasn't risen to the level of criminality yet. This is why I try to only deal with exchanges registered in my country. At least I might have some recourse through the courts in that case.
How many problematic 30k wire transfers do they have to deal with? This is serious money, and they should be working to resolve this as soon as possible.

Yes, try to support decentralized exchanges like Radar Relay and others. For bitcoin ones I'm only okay with bittrex and binance really. I'm checking out kucoin though and it seems okay but support is non existent. Took like 12 hours to withdraw funds but it happened.
"A big problem I see with how these issues are handled in crypto space is that there seems to be so little regard for the client experience.

I work for a major broker (15000 + advisors) and we have a compliance department that would be on top of this kind of thing so fast. If the client is missing money and it's a back office issue we give the client that money out of our pocket while we work on the issue.

Clients shouldn't be left holding the bag and for companies like mine there are regulatory requirements that are quite strict when things like this happen."

"I'm not here to defend cex but from my previous encounters with them all of my issues were solved ... EVENTUALLY ... that being the keyword. I was persistent but kept my calm and composure and eventually they answered and got things done this  includes:

Late credit card withdrawals

Misteriously dissappearings of my card details from the withdrawal page

11k$ SEPA Transfer Pending for 2 weeks

Misterious declines of already confirmed credit card when trying to re-add it ...

And plenty more. I followed their instructions, got automated copy paste messages, read them, followed the new instructions, didn't work, replyed patiently and eventually a human signed email came with instructions that when followed got my problem solved in 24 hours usually.

So be patient, don't be agressive (I know it's hard when someone is holding your money hostage) and eventually you'll get it solved ... at least I did.

Also did you try bitcointalk and /r/cexio ?"
I was just thinking of using CEX for the next time i take profits, damn.
The whole thing about exchanges like CEX is I don't believe them to be financially solvent enough on the scale of if people emptying the wine bottle fast or like banks during the great recession of 2008. 
I also lost about $200 from a cex.io withdrawal maybe a year or so ago. Wasn't really enough for me to make a big deal about, I just wrote it off as the cost of learning who cannot be trusted with larger amounts in the future.
Don't let them silence you.

"About 2 months ago I submitted my second request for verification through CEX.IO; I finally got a response today telling me that my application was rejected, even though I completed everything according to their instructions. I previously tried to get verified on this exchange over a year ago, but the ID I had at the time didn't meet the appropriate requirements.

How can I get this money out of CEX.IO? They require that I wait another 30 days before resubmitting a verification request, and they haven't even specified what caused my application to be rejected.

I'm presuming I can look to buy crypto, move it to another exchange, and withdraw through that exchange. I have a coinbase account, but I can't figure out from their website if I am verified/what that process is or if withdraws from a USD wallet (native to their site) to a USD Bank Account/Visa Card are allowed.

Thanks for your help and add this to the increasing list of complaints about CEX.IO."

Just thought I'd post my experience. Before doing a large withdrawal, I tested CEX with 100 GBP. They deducted 30 GBP and the eventual credit to my account was to be 70 GBP. My bank rejected the credit and it took over 2 months for CEX to give me back my 70 GBP. I just bought some BCH with it and transferred it out. So yes GBP withdrawals are a problem with CEX.
"Just FYI you can only start applying that 8% rate (it's actually 8% plus the bank base rate as well) to payments more than 60 days late unless otherwise agreed.

The government has the moneyclaim online service though which is very easy to use, and I somehow doubt CEX.io will even bother turning up to court so it's likely you'll win by default.

But basically CEX.io is now embroiled in the Finex/Tether money laundering fraud, so you should be quick about it as they are likely to go down too when this all comes to a head."

"> Malleability is much more an issue in a Blockchain with RBF

no, it's not, that wouldn't make any sense

Malleability is fixed in bitcoin (the real bitcoin) and RBF is not an issue AT ALL. (It's an optional feature, and the transactions is signed as ""non final"", btw, you can't change the reciver address, like is saying in BCH website)

so, it looks like that you have read about RBF in BCH sites, which are clearly lying about RBF

In any case, saying that RBF is an issue clearly show that you DON'T know how it work, nor what it is

>90 percent txs that refuse to use the Segwit BS

Not exactly. They're not refusing, that would be idiot, because they would pay 4x more for a transaction, the segwit on the core wallet was not launched yet, that's why they're not using segwit already"

"I did not understand what you meant by ""1 MB blocks are about 35% per year""

1 MB of what per year? 

And with 17% increase in storage/bandwidth per dollar, over 9 years the bitcoin exists, that means 4.11 times increase. Sure, it's not 8 times as BCH did increase. 

But there would be no problems with 2 MB blocks, and if it was implemented at the time of the fork, it would remove all the times there were 100k+ unconfirmed transactions in backlog. 

1MB ~ 400k transactions per day. Worst backlog was about 270k transactions, and it took days to decrease even below 200k.

Do you also have further examples of examples of induced demand other than roadways, parking lots and vending machines as I don't really see how any of them is relevant to the topic of cryptocurrency. 

Also there does not seem to be a definitive answer on whether and how much induced demand impacts capacity expansions. See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_demand#Studies) with
>A comparison of congestion data from 1982 to 2011 by the Texas A&M Transportation Institute clearly demonstrated that additional roadways reduced the rate of congestion increase. When increases in road capacity were matched to the increase demand, growth in congestion was found to be much lower.

Maybe, but I've asked many timesbefore I was banned from /r/bitcoin how they know that 1mb is the right size?

"I find it to be a gross ethical violation to claim something is a ""peer-reviewed paper"" if it has not *passed* peer-review and been accepted to publication.

Miners process the transactions, nodes help by relaying and validating.

"> The peer-review pass rate for presenting at conferences is like 99%.  Only in journal articles do you have the rigorous peer-review process where a peer is actually likely to reject a paper due to flaws in process.

Maybe this is true in some fields, but not in any of the engineering fields I am familiar with (I literally have never heard of any ""peer reviewed"" International academic conference with a 99% acceptance rate).

Standards vary from conference to conference and journal to journal.  Journal standards are often higher than conferences, but conferences still do meaningful peer review.

This conference seems to be highly rated, and its acceptance rate in 2017 was 40% (39 accepted papers out of a submitted 96).  Source: http://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783642275753

Why should miner take new block from non-mining node when he can directly connect to a miner?
Non-mining nodes *delay* the propagation of transactions.

I believe there is useful data there. You are assuming I weigh it heavily versus the actual content of the post.
"Miners take transactions (not blocks) from their peers. That includes both mining nodes and “full nodes” that don’t mine.  Both kinds of nodes keep a partial list of pending transactions called the mempool. Nodes are connected via a peer2peer network, which allow them to get transactions from a convenient peer, regardless of whether that peer is a miner.

It’s good for the network to have independent verification from non-miners, just in case the interests of miners diverge from the interests of the network as a whole."
Well BCH is going that way, so sweet

Our problems are non-events compared to the problems of your high fee chain where peer-to-peer cash got destroyed.
"As compelling as your argument sounds on the surface, the block chain growth rate is asymptotically approaching zero anyway.

* The current block chain size is about 150.000 MB; does that sound about right?
* If the target block time (10 min if I'm not mistaken) is reached, you'd get **one MB** every **ten minutes**, correct?
* So you get six MB every hour, 144MB every day, and ~52.000MB every year.
* Now these are the 35% you mentioned. 

What you seem to ignore or forgot to mention is that next years block chain will start at ~ 200.000MB, still growing at roughly 52.000MB/year.

So the rates of growth for the next years (and **full 1MB blocks**) would be


Current Year |  + 0 | + 1 | + 2 | + 3 | + 4 | + 5 | + 6 | + 7
------------|----|---|---|---|---|---|---|---
Growth Rate [%] | 35 | 26 | 20 | 17 | 15 | 13 | 11 | 10

So, the diminishing growth is outpaced by the 17%/year decline in price in roughly four years' time. "
"This year or? I mean if blocks have been 1MB since beginng of Bitcoin, then last year of blokchain data should be 1/9th of total blokchain size - about 11%.

Doesnt currently blokchain grow linearly? "
Isn't bandwidth requirements cut in half thou.  Since you are rebuilding the block from your own mempool without having to receive all the TXs again.

"First of all, you brought up 'induced demand' as applicable to BTC, so it's not on me to disprove your claim but rather your onus  to show why it applies.
Not to mention the insanity of arguing supply and demand of the 'ability to move a digital asset'.

edit: I forgot to mention, I think you're right, 2MB blocks would probably fill up, as - I expect - would 4MB blocks. But this way you could get transactions validated faster and cheaper - which was the whole point of BTC in the first place.

Besides that, why do you think that people would rush back to BTC? It had its first-mover advantage and far-reaching merchant implementation and lost it due to being unreliable and - to a large extend - unusable for payments. 
If the implementation for LN sees similar levels as the SegWit implementation I don't see a chance for it solving the congestion issue.

Now, BTC is far from being the only cryptocurrency and I don't see why anyone would get into BTC other than that they heard about it in the news and don't know about the alternatives. "

I don't know what field you're talking about it, but the one I work in this is generally not the case (for reputable International conferences, at least): peer review is conducted prior to accepting a paper to be presented in the conference.  In any case, this conference's call for papers makes it pretty that papers accepted for presentation have been peer reviewed:

The name of the conference is given right there. Financial Cryptography and Data Security. It's a well-respected venue. The paper will appear on the FCDC site when the conference organizers put it together, some time before February.

In most of computer science, publication occurs in Conferences, not Journals. It's often more prestigious to publish in a conference rather than a journal. It's weird if you're coming from another field, but it is what it is. Econ has even weirder customs though, so we in CS don't feel bad about our ways.

Why do they keep ignoring the miner limit? They can decide for themselves what size blocks they solve. The one in the protocol is just for safety and should not be in any way part of the capacity debate. The way I see it is that supply/demand with miners/transactions will cause the system to stabilize and adapt as needed.
"> whether or not block size increase provides a feasible long term solution for transaction volume scaling.

That is totally OK. Block Size increase was never meant to be a silver bullet or even a long term plan. It was always meant to be a short term fix while a long term solution is being developed or as part of a long term solution.

Same as SegWit in that regard. SegWit on its own does not provide much scaling (and can not provide more than that), but it was always advertised as a first step to lightning.

We could have made a Block Size increase while lightning is being developed and given that lightning also might need a Block Size increase anyways to function correctly it would have made sense to do it sooner rather then later.

"
So... basically it's enough to support the blocksize increase from the segwit side-effect. 
Paging /u/el33th4xor
Good points.  Given Segwit has stalled at 8-10% due to lack of community support wouldn’t it be fair to take away the segwit weight discount and raise the block size to 1.7mb.  This would provide benefit immediately and show no bias or preferential treatment to either solutions.
Given the availability of alternatives such as Zcash, Monero, Bitcoin Cash, PIVX, and Dash, this block size debate is moot and is of interest only to academics. Hence this debate belongs in /r\/Bitcoin, not in /r\/BTC.
Step 0: What is centralization and what metric do we measure it by?
Hmm, I wonder if the bitcoin whitepaper would have passed the peer review process... u/tippr 200 bits
"Miners can put whatever they want on the block and propagate it, they could basically Spawn coins by sending themselves money that doesn't exist (i.e. making a transaction from an empty wallet). Other miners would discover this and ignore his block, but if a miner controls 51% of the hashpower he can grow the main chain faster than all the other miners and to the chain with his invalid block would become the default one.

Probably impossible, because even if 30 or 20% of the hashpower remains honest they would probably still work on the non-default chain (because they know the other one is invalid), which would cause an split, and  probably imply in lower difficulty, which attracts more miners to the second chain, and since the attack would only last for as long as someone can maintain 51% the blockchain would eventually stabilize. 

However if someone can maintain 51% for a long time he would push the other miners out, because the miners are making a bet, that the faulty chain will eventually fail, and his chain (which he mined more easily) will be chosen, but if that takes a while to happen the miner might just go mine something else, further increasing the power of the attacker. But even then if the community discovers this it's easily verifiable and that chain can be purposefully ignored by most wallets, rendering the attack useless. But this would require higher consensus between several different parties, which is neither easy or fast."
Can someone correct me if I’m wrong but doesn’t x-thin / graphine like technologies GREATLY reduce the bandwidth need anyways?

Im paying ~$50 cad a month for 150mbps unlimited in Canada.
"Why wouldn't they think it's a slippery-slope when the roadmap of Bitcoin ABC clearly states that further blocksize increases are going to happen in a very near future?

The bandwidth issue at the current scale isn't an immediate problem, neither with BCH nor with BTC (with Segwit's increase). It will become a problem with much larger blocks and since bandwidth doesn't follow Moore's law it will be the first bottleneck people willing to run a node or start mining will hit, way sooner than storage/computer power. That's surely the reason why it is mentioned as the next problem with further blocksize increases."
Years down the road internet will get faster and storage cheaper.
"How many years?  25?  

How about we go backwards in time 25 years, since we know what happened.   25 years ago, average computers had less than 1 MB of system memory and a 40MB hard drive was considered to be huge.  That’s megabytes not gigabytes.  For anyone who doesn’t know, a gigabyte is one thousand megabytes.  

Someone from 25 years ago would be mind-blown over how much storage capacity we have now.

Darn scamming BCH shills everywhere, everyone knows anything more than 1MB blocks leads to centralization, the Lightning Network will save us and be totally decentralized, honest. /s 
">Higher allocated bandwidth indicates that the maximum blocksize can be increased without impacting orphan rates, which in turn affect decentralization. If people were happy about the level of decentralization in 2016, they should be able to increase the block size by **1.7x** to clear almost twice as many transactions per second while maintaining the same level of decentralization.

That´s the increase SegWit introduced >6 months ago, just saying. 

>To date, we have seen no sound, quantitative arguments for any specific value of the maximum block size in Bitcoin.

Why is BCH limited to 32MB? No more block size increases, remove the limit already!"
"> Bitcoin nodes generally have higher bandwidth allocated to them than Ethereum. ... a much higher percentage of Bitcoin nodes reside in datacenters

The paper seems to use ""nodes"" confusingly to mean ""miners"" (as was the definition while Satoshi was around) or ""non-mining relays"" (the layer of volunteer middlemen that cypherpunks inserted between miners and clients to after he left).

Those non-mining relays should not exist.  They do not contribute anything to the network; on the contrary, they break its (already weak) security guarantees.  They are one of the fatal flaws that, objectively, made bitcoin a failed project already by 2013.  (That particular flaw could be fixed by eliminating those relays; but, while technically easy, it is politically impossible.)

> Both Bitcoin and Ethereum mining are very centralized, with the top four miners in Bitcoin and the top three miners in Ethereum controlling more than 50% of the hash rate.

This is another fatal flaw that made bitcoin a failure; and this one has no known remedy, not even in theory.  Centralization of mining is unavoidable for several economic reasons, independent of details of the protocol.  

But here the paper uses ""miner"" when it should more properly say ""pool"".   For centralization purposes, pools are the main concern; but it is worth distinguishing them from the miners, since the latter may migrate between pools.   (Although, as the authors note, this possibility is often exaggerated by bitcoin fans, and the migration may be in the direction opposite to what they are counting on.)

> Put another way, some hash power is wasted on uncles, which do not help carry out directly useful sequencing work on the chain.

This is not seem correct, since it apparently does not take into account the dependency of hashpower on efficiency and the difficulty adjustments.  While every miner hates to see his block orphaned, because of those compensation mechanisms the orphan rate has no effect on the total revenue of the miners, their profit margins, their total energy expenditure, or the capacity and response time of the network.   

Namely, the throughput and delay are constant because the rate of non-orphan blocks is constant; the market dynamics will tend to keep the profit margin constant, and the energy expenditure will be a fixed fraction of the block revenues, which are constant."
"The linked article was not quoted verbatim. The actual sentence reads: ""To date, we have seen no sound, quantitative arguments for any specific value of the maximum block size in Bitcoin.""

The following claim seems to more closely reflect what they actually can back up with data, and is: ""If people were happy about the level of decentralization in 2016, they should be able to increase the block size by 1.7x to clear almost twice as many transactions per second while maintaining the same level of decentralization.""

Between 2016 and now, Bitcoin got SegWit, which is an actual block size increase from 1MB to about 1.8MB - 2.0MB (theoretical maximum is just short of about 4.000.000 Bytes). So the update did just what the paper claims to be a reasonable increase considering the median bandwidth increase of nodes, if the levels of decentralization in 2016 are deemed good enough by users of Bitcoin (meaning that one could argue that they are not, or that lesser decentralization would still be ok)

The paper makes other interesting points, but I will need more time to read it closely."
"I understand that a ""longitudinal"" study is supposed to take place over a long period of time, even decades. This took place between 2015 and 2017. Interesting nonetheless, but I don't think we can draw any conclusions about blockchains at scale because we have yet to see blockchains at real scale."

"I sure love this slippery-slope argument that proponents of 1MB blocks always bring up, e.g. in the comments to this article
> Receiving gigabytes and terabytes of information quickly gets expensive and cost prohibitive.

I can't think of anyone that says 'starting tomorrow you'll have to receive (and store, obviously) gigabytes and terabytes of data to keep track. If your argument is that someday the block chain could be too big to store; that could also be true for 1MB, 300KB or 100KB blocks.

Also, doesn't the bandwidth 'issue' apply to SegWit blocks as well? Isn't there actually more than 1MB of data to download in order to validate a block (transaction block + witness data)?"
That happens when your peers are all incompetent, I guess.

">Both Bitcoin and Ethereum mining are very centralized, with the top four miners in Bitcoin and the top three miners in Ethereum controlling more than 50% of the hash rate.

Ugh this is very misleading. Do people still not understand that mining pools do not equate to miners? "
"> ""no sound, quantitative arguments for any specific value of the maximum block size in Bitcoin""

I don't think so.  See [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7qh0qv/antpool_mined_an_8mb_block/dsqvva2/?context=3)"
What a wasteful academic endeavour, like looking for a quantitative argument on the maximum road width. Academics like these *completely* fail to understand that innovation happens because of limitations, and for Bitcoin and Ethereum to scale in a decentralized way (real autonomous power to the edges), they will need a heck of a lot of incredible innovation. This kind of academic thinking would have led to cars with bicycle wheels, utter waste of taxpayers resources for minimal advancement of blockchain tech.

What if they weren’t?"
Can you guys not do math? Sure it may not be an issue now, but think years down the road...
If they weren't they should do something about it, buy mining hardware and get cracking. There really is no point in saying 'this is just too much centralization' and not trying to change it.
What do you mean by centralization? If it really was a problem, you could change the hashing algorithm and make ASIC-s useless. There you removed 85% of China controlled hashing power, and make mining profitable for everyone.

"I don't know much about it. Increasing block size and the argument that it's sticking to Satoshi's original vision made sense... at first glance.

The strongest argument I've heard against the above is that bitcoin core is doing really smart things!

But honestly, Historically looking at the last year limiting block size really put BTC into the media. By capping it in the knees they essentially made it a global sensation. 

No one could have predicted that chain of events, could they?"
">the network

isn't an entity. If a user wants to be able to verify his or her transactions and balances without having to trust anyone else, running a full node matters. And it only slows the network down if the user chooses to not relay blocks nor listen in for peers."
It does make sense at 800MB with today's technology. If ssd sizes and internet speeds rise a lot in 20 years as per Moore's Law, it still will look silly. Even then, 1MB>>8MB is low hanging fruit. Even the LN whitepaper envisions a network with 133MB blocks to run LN on top of. If LN/second layer is so good, then let's get the low hanging fruit now to keep the network running smoothly, and introduce the second layer when the tech is there.
Mining nodes *are* rewarded. Full nodes are only needed for businesses.
I'm suprised by the strong negative reaction to your suggestion.  Other cryptocurrencies reward nodes and have healthier node counts as a result
Segwit delivered 1.07 since just 10 percent of the txs use that rube goldberg 'solution'.
Without having read it I'd say that's why they were testing 1.7x increase.
"Most reputable scientific conferences have a peer-review process to accept papers for presentation at the conference (and subsequent publication in their proceedings).  Uploading an accepted, peer-reviewed conference paper to arXiv prior to the conference (since the proceedings wont be available yet), is common practice.  Vitalik was not part of the peer-review process, but the ""anonymous reviewers"" mentioned would be.

Edit: From the conference's ""Call for Papers"" (https://fc18.ifca.ai/cfp.html ):

> Research papers should describe novel, previously unpublished scientific contributions to the field, and they will be subject to rigorous peer review."
In computer science we don't use journals, we use conferences. It's a clearly a peer-reviewed paper since it's for a peer reviewed conference of high prestige.
"Its a paper that's been accepted to the Financial Cryptography and Data Security 2018 scientific conference, which peer-reviews their submissions (as most scientific conferences do).

https://fc18.ifca.ai/cfp.html

> Research papers should describe novel, previously unpublished scientific contributions to the field, and they will be subject to rigorous peer review.

Thus, it is peer-reviewed."
Perhaps the devs made their own research.
"You appear to have you currencies mixed up. But the prediction Bitcoin Cash makes is that tiny blocks are an evolutionary dead-end. It's effectively just a waiting game.

As I'm holding both, it's a heads-I-win, tails-I-win for me. Unless it's all goes to alts which is where Core has been leading us.

Edit: I just checked what you were responding to. Your answer is nonsense. Learn what a metric is."
You’re an adult right?  Cuz ... just checking.  I mean, behavior and whatnot.  
Unless it is approved by the Blockstream clergy the paper is to be considered heretic.
Only at around 17% per year. For comparison, 1 MB blocks are about 35% per year. So the improvements don't keep up, and the situation just gets worse and worse.

"Furthermore, the only real ""full node"" that matters in any way for the network is a *mining* node. If you have a ""full node"" that does no mining, all you have is an extremely fat wallet. You don't really matter on the network. If anything, you're slowing the network down. "
"What a *darn* shame..

^^Darn ^^Counter: ^^806"
Core's argument starts to make sense only when talking about 800MB blocks, the cost of bandwidth required for 8MB is negligible.
You wouldn't say that if you lived here in Brazil tho.
For free? Hard pass. Reward nodes or no interest.
I love the conclusion, increase of block size of 1.7 compared to 2016 without any loss of decentralisation. It's a wonderful coincidence, SegWit delivered just that!!! Didn't read the paper, but did you mention this block size increase?
Yes. Computer science peer review is done at conferences. 
"Conference papers don't typically undergo the same rigorous review process as papers published in leading scientific journals. Conferences can actually be kind of a shady thing in academia, because a lot of people essentially pay to have their lesser papers ""published"" at these events. Professors often do this because sometimes their salaries are directly tied to the number of papers they have published. Mileage varies by university and department. Conference papers aren't necessarily a bad thing, but it's important to keep in mind that there's an economy there."
Forget supply and demand. We need peer reviewed 5-year plans. As long as it's peer reviewed we can't go wrong. Peer review, much science, such wow.
Yeah I find that interesting. Segwit is 1.7x and this paper recommends the same. Why?
That's why we upgraded bitcoin to Bitcoin BCH
So, you mean to tell me that a computer science paper is not actually dealing with economic theory?
"Take this with a grain of salt, but this represents my current understanding:

The SegWit discount has a technical background. 

Basically, old miners can verify blocks with SegWit transactions, despite not knowing about SegWit at all. When a non-updated Bitcoin node requests the block data, SegWit enabled nodes remove everything the other node wouldn't understand. This is possible because SegWit was designed to allow this, and because it doesn't change any of the previous consensus rules, it just adds new ones for SegWit nodes. It's the reason why SegWit is a soft fork, whereas raising the block size limit would be a hard fork (meaning miners with old node software would reject those blocks). 

A soft fork was the preferred solutions by developers at the time, as there was no consensus on how much to increase the block size, which might have resulted in various forks of Bitcoin, each with a different block size limit or new rule on how to grow the block size naturally. This would have caused big headaches for the security assumptions in PoW cryptocurrencies, especially if they all have the same PoW algorithm. It would have made all of them more insecure.

So why the discount for SegWit? As old nodes don't see SegWit data, but only the parts of the transaction which can be validated by old nodes, a SegWit block is basically up to 1MB (the old limit) + the segregated witness data. The segregated witness data is (roughly speaking) the part that was once added to the ScriptSig, so just the signature and public key. Because of that, certain parts of the transaction (input ids, outputs, etc) will always have to remain in the old block, while the signature and key (which make up a good portion of a transaction, byte wise) are in the new part. This new part is the part that gets the discount. And the only reason why the size of the new part is even limited to 3MB (and not just not counted at all) is to protect the network against artificially inflated blocks that have transactions that do nothing sensible but only try to inflate blocks as much as possible, as all useful transactions have a certain ratio of old part and new part, which seems to cause a maximum of 50% of data ending up in the new part.

Additionally, because SegWit transactions are not vulnerable to a certain type of attack that causes high CPU usage when verifying blocks with certain transactions, this attack vector was not made more potent with this type of block increase, as you can still only add the same amount of non-SegWit (but vulnerable/exploitable) transactions as before.

All said and done, IMO the primary reason was to not create a hard fork and split the community into many shards, thereby making double spends and attacks on the network more likely. At the same time, they could still increase tx/s that way."
We measure everything in Bitcoin by consensus, the fork of Bitcoin that the market values most highly. Bcash makes the subjective case that big blocks are a worthwhile compromise to centralisation, the market currently disagrees.
There's also node centralization (being able to afford to run a node) and user limitation (being able to afford paying fees).
While at he same time destroying the security of the network

"It's ilegal to mine here if you're not registered. And just as you said, is so heavily taxed that many have gone to jail because they don't want to lose the investment.

The electricity here is extremely cheap, one month of electricity in a average house of 4 is about $0.04 cents, and millions don't even pay it. The government only charge in the ""rich zones"" because they are billed way higher. So many people saw the advantages of mining here(I wasn't one of them). Now is way riskier.

The cherry on the top is that there are reports that the military have huge mining  farms throughout the country, but they have guns so nobody messes with them.

"Correct. To get a fast confirmation you probably need about 1 USD. The fees per byte are maybe 2-3 times that of BCH, but Monero transactions are much larger in size. So for things like buying a car you can use Monero without issue. The GUI/CLI wallet developers have considered setting the default fee much lower which will reduce fees for everyone (less competition) When Bulletproofs are implemented the tx size will decrease to ~1/5 the size but this is a ways away because it must be formally reviewed. At the very earliest it could be in the March hardfork but that seems unlikely.

That's naive. They're using dollars too, and dollars are worth what they're worth because they're backed by the US, not Venezuela.

"The only logical conclusion is that you’re advocating for stateless system, which is fine with me, we can argue about pros and cons and ways to implement social policies in a decentralized and voluntarist manner, but I would much rather talk about reality and how to improve the society I live in. Like the taxation or not - it’s not going anywhere.

On one hand wealth redistribution is immoral, on the other - wealth accumulation creates skewed incentives that lead to overwhelming majority of population being fucked over, which is immoral too.

"> Taxes aren't bills, it's civilized robbery. 

Taxes are bills to fund the government that provides you services. You can repeat these YouTube slogans as much as you want, it doesn’t make them true.

> Built a road I consented to? Bill me.

So fuck everybody who is poor and can’t paid for a dedicated road? Or should they form some kind of an organization where everybody has to give some money so that everybody gets access to decent roads? You know, like this thing they call *government*?

> no one has right to my labor

No one claims it. You’re expected to pay for things you are already getting from a society and nobody gives a shit that maybe you don’t think you need them or they aren’t worth your money, because these things don’t exist for you personally, they exist for the better of a society."
"That is not how the current system works.

"> Look at why Rome fell. Most of the Productive men left and fled to country due to high taxes.

seriously? your example is some ancient empire? not only is ""why rome fell"" still an open question for historians, you can't make these absolutely speculative conclusions.

what is the measure of productivity you use to evaluate ancient rome? what reliable statistical data about productivity versus income levels versus demographics do you have about ancient rome? what reliable statistical data do you have about volume of emigration out of rome versus emigration reasons versus demographics and income levels?

you're just making claims that fir your worldview because you'd like them to be true.

> More high earners like me end up leaving or purposefully remaining very unproductive on paper to pay less tax and squeek by

again, where is the statistical data on this? just claims that you would like to be true.

these claims might sound logical to you, but as i've already said, it's because you place no value on benefits from social policies that you are getting both directly and indirectly."
"Communism failed everywhere.

The fact is that high taxes drive the most productive members out.

I have moved out of the country and now save 40k/year.  The top 20% of earners pay 95% of taxes already. The top 2% pay 50% of all taxes and therefore society has these top earners to thank.  

How much more do you think is **fair**?"
"what on earth communism has to do with our discussion? as i've mentioned before, the tendency of people like you to jump into extremes is quite annoying.

also, not at all surprisingly, you gave zero data points about both rome and modern world examples that you provided.

just because you think something is likely doesn't mean it is actually true no matter how appealing that though is to you because of your worldview.

> The top 20% of earners pay 95% of taxes already. The top 2% pay 50% of all taxes and therefore society has these top earners to thank.

cute numbers. how about this perspective: the bottom 80% has so little wealth they could only contribute 5% of total tax collected. that's related to my next point:

> How much more do you think is fair?

do spend a second about what the above numbers mean: some dude without any savings that has a family to feed is paying a whole month's rent worth of money in taxes while some other dude is paying what is literally a pocket change for him compared to the wealth he has already accumulated.

and maybe the poor chump earned it. maybe they are lazy or not trying or a million more reasons. the real question here is not what is fair to the poor guy and to the rich guy but how to tune the knobs of the system such that the society overall is better off.

how many people do you think turn to crime because they see no other way out? how many people end up at the bottom because their parents couldn't afford better education or paying rent in better location? how much richer would top 2% be if everybody was better educated, more productive and could afford more goods and services? isn't that ultimately the measure you want to optimize for?

so to answer your question:

> How much more do you think is fair?

fairness is not the goal because it's impossible to define. well functioning society is the goal. and to get there we probably need much more - negative income tax or universal basic income. ultimately, for a rational person, personal wealth doesn't matter past certain point.

also if your argument is that the system should be merit-based then your perfect tax-less society would be the worst, as from generation to generation overwhelming majority of wealthiest citizens would get their wealth from inheritance and they have earned none of it."
"Maybe one day you will start a successful business or earn a lot of money. You will understand this then I guarantee it.

Right now, the ""poor bottom earners"" are not kept down by some greedy capitalists, as many liberals and socialists would say.

My father shutdown his business because they raised minimum wage so high here so quickly.  **He was tired of working 12 hour days to make less than his employees**. 

7 people are now out of work. He was barely making enough profit before, but was solvent and had a happy job for his employees and serving the community.

Now he works a shit job, earning more and have more free time. The others are not fighting for jobs in the marketplace.

Socialist policies like raising minimum wage only create disincentives for the ambitious and hard working folks.

Whatever you say, it is obvious to anyone here that worked hard their whole life or owns a business that you have not been on both sides.

We are immigrants and came with nothing to this country and paid back ALL subsidies and grants when we arrived, unlike the new immigrants that serve as democrat voting cattle and remain stuck on welfare.

We even went bankrupt twice and worked all 2-3 shitty jobs for 15 years to make things happen.

We could have blamed the capitalists and sat on our asses like **most of the other immigrants** that came into the country at the time.

These guys sit at coffee shop sipping on water or 1 coffee and gossip all day.

We fucking went door to door offering our labour and reinvesting in ourselves.

The myth of the greedy capitalist and poor underworked proletariet is bullshit.

I hear half of these peoples stories and I want to smack them for being such complaining losers expecting things handed to them. 

They blame the system and patriarchy amd what have you... yet they waste money on booze, smokes, lottery, shitty reality television, overpriced cars, designer brand shit and the newest iphone to show off to other food stamp collectors.

Me? I'll drive my shitty 15 year old used cars, buy things on bargain and haven't watched TV in 20 damn years.

You cannot tell me that a poor person watching ANY amount of TV is being kept down.... they are willfully wasting their time here on this planet



**reasons for fall of Rome**

6 of the 8 reasons for the fall have to do with:

- mass immigration/migrants
- high taxes, heavy welfare state
- political corruption (need bureaucrats to adminster social programs)
- inflation due to taxes for military spending
- rise of liberalism (fall of traditional values)

http://www.history.com/news/history-lists/8-reasons-why-rome-fell


In other words: socialism"
"1) you’ve just dumped a ton of anecdata, which while interesting to read and useful experience for you, is unfortunately not at all useful to make big-picture conclusions like you do. I mean you’ve just piled stereotype upon stereotype. Lazy poor people sipping coffee all day and watching tv, yeah right.

And it’s not like you have to convince me than most countries didn’t get social policies perfectly right, the thing we are talking about is if social policies can work in principle and if there can be rational argument to prefer them over extreme libertarian policies.

2) as I said, it is still open question why Rome fell among historians and you find data that supports any political ideology of today, not really worth going into details.

Besides, of those reasons you described I can’t quite see the connection with social policies. Heavy military spending is not a social policy. Neither is having corrupt politicians nor rise of liberalism. It just looks like a wishful thinking of a conservative. Consider your biases when googling for and interpreting information. Confirmation bias is a bitch.

Oh and by the way, the very first statement you made absolutely betrays that your argument is emotional rather than logical. I make decent money and I pay fairly high taxes and I have different opinion than you do."
Heavy military is social spending  (ie comes from social populations taxes and provides defense for society)
Absolutely not. Military spending and social programs are about as far apart as you can get in a state budget.

Ok, wait. Are you serious right now?  
I am from Eastern Europe, where wages are much lower than in 1st world countries (Weestern Europe, USA, Canada, NZ, AUS, etc), however still a normal summer bill is like $30 and a normal winter bill is averaging $100 to $200 (because you need to pay for heating during the winter, who the fuck has airconditioner to use in the summer to cool off :D ).  
So you are telling me that in Venezuella a family of 4 that cooks, uses some heating, has lights on, computer on, etc, pays $0.04 (four cents) for a monthly electricity bill?  
  
EDIT:  
I just checked Numbeo, it's my favourite place to check Cost of Living, and they only have on city in Venezuella - [Caracas](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/in/Caracas)  
Accordin to the website (and its firly accurate - I've checked it for a few locations I've lived in, in different countries) some things are ""normal"" price for even a western country and some things are quite cheap.  
For instance cheap is Internet - just $3 a month, Gasoline - $0.01 for a litter (what the fuck, it's over $1 here), monthly electricity and water bills $11 for 85 square metters appartment - this is really cheap still.
Expensivish are: Meal for 2 in a restourant - $38 (not that that's a lot, but compared to the rest), Taxi - $1 per km (when Gasoline is $0.01 wtf).

And we end up with Salary: $33 - LOL"

It's a valid question. One I've asked myself too. Presumably he believes difficulty will stabilize and mining will be more profitable over the course of the year.

"If he has the money to buy the S9 outright, why can't he just buy BCH on an exchange and send it to his family? This way, he can get the liquidity immediately, without dealing with power, nethash fluctuations, and the whole deal. 

I believe what you said, but the rationale doesn't add up."
Capitalism incentivized you to help this man in need. Consider that.
We are in a war. Pay attention to the real news.
"Mining is hard in Vzla, in one side you are subject to racketeering (like any other business) from both thugs and police, and also the electricity is really unreliable (think of busted ACs and refrigerators due to power surges), so one of the big things cryptos can help with is withe cheaper remittance (there no legal ways to send money without using the shitty exchange rate fixed by the government). The downside, is that with more and more honest Venezuelan emigrating, the changes your counterparty is just a government thug (more likely one of their many associates) trying to get their stolen money out and clean.

So first they rob us, and now the diaspora might be helping them clean their money. So good on you guys for trying to help, we are fucked up beyond a point many of you would understand. "

No need to feel bad. Capitalism is what will save Venezuela that was destroyed by socialism.
"Its the government of venezuala that is the problem. Capitalism has given the man that ability to feed his family now, and you've earned yourself a bit of money for your part - thats true capitalism; win win.

Without the money incentive I doubt you would of been buying and selling S9's to begin with "

BCH is catching on like a wildfire in venezuela
He does not need to get it up and running quickly to get them food, because that makes no sense, if he had 2BCH worth of some currency, he could have just got BCH and sent it directly right now, instead he made a *gamble* on a S9 hoping to get a better ROI on his money *in time*. No need to feel bad IMO.
Dont blame yourself. Venezuelan Gov completely screwed their people. Good thing crypto is just in time to save them.
"> I've felt like absolute shit all day for being a greedy capitalist asshole

Irrational self-attack coming surely from some type of Socialist propaganda that got to you, especially considering that you helped this guy..."
"> I guess I just needed to tell you all this because I've felt like absolute shit all day for being a greedy capitalist asshole while this guy just wanted to feed his friends and family in a country that epitomizes what the power of BCH was created to combat.

So you gave him a discount then?

Edit: Oh I see you already replied to someone, suggesting you did. Bravo."
Your greed is someone's enabler. Price is fair because you both agreed to it.
">I've felt like absolute shit all day for being a greedy capitalist asshole 

Did you exploit the guy? No. He wanted to buy an S9, you were looking to sell, you agreed upon a price. All good my dude.

If it makes you feel any better, the fact that Venezuela is suffering isn't your fault and on better days they're not all that different from you and me. 

Edit: To make this clear, it's absolutely normal and good to feel compassionate and sad upon realizing the guy's background, but no need to personally feel bad about yourself."
venezuela is the first place to experience hyperbitcoinization, it really is, it's a mild one but it's the first one so that makes sense.. comes at a very awkward time
Why doesn't he just buy the BCH and send it to them instead of paying for electricity to mine it first and then send it to them?
"So first of all, your story was really heartwarming and i like the thought that through cryptos the world can get a little bit better and maybe feed everyone.

but the main reason why i am reply is your salty gut punch.
> I've felt like absolute shit all day for being a greedy capitalist asshole while this guy just wanted to feed his friends and family in a country that epitomizes what the power of BCH was created to combat.
> 
> What are we doing to each other in this world?

why you are thinking that you are greedy? besides people who really just buy Cryptos to be more ""powerful"" and ""have more"" we all, buy, sell, HODL because of various reasons.
Some do it because they wanna feed their family, some other people do it because they want to buy a lambo!
I for example do it because i wanna see my family debt free and after that go finally for a trip to japan!
i am at the beginning at my 30, unemployed and hitting the school again (don't know how to translate in english what i am exactly doing), and living on the edge with his money till 2019! Crypto seemed to me the best way to achieve those things before my mother getting too old! (because i want to see her travel too alot when she is retired)

But in the end, we all do it because we wanna achieve things which seems to be impossible to us before!
We are after all still humans with needs and wants! We are seeing an opportunity and we try to grab it, because nobody knows when we will see the next one!

so if you are a god damn multi millionaire who just invest because ""HE CAN"" you should feel like a greedy asshole who does more bad than good to this world.

but if you're just a regulare person who has a dream, no matter what, if its never going to work anymore (and have 24hours for friends and family) or a lanbo (because its a car you always wanted to own), you should not punch yourself in the gut. You just try to do your best.

Or like Terry Crews said:
> “Everybody says they're trying to get their piece of the pie. They don't realize that the world is a kitchen – you can make your own pie.”

and after you're done with baking, you can share it or help people to make their own pie! Ü

Why are you a greedy capitalist asshole, when it’s his socialist government that’s the problem? I don’t understand.
Is one S9 running at home profitable?!
Keep calm. Capitalism leads to economic and technological development, while socialism, as wrote Friedrich Hayek, is a road to serfdom that destroyed many countries in Latin America, including Venezuela. 
"Don't be ashamed of being a capitalist - be ashamed of the 'socialists' who are ruining Venezuela!

Thanks for sharing, and I hope things change for the better in Venezuela soon... it's a horrible situation, and I hope this new friend of yours manages to use crypto-currency to help his family!"
How did u sell it btw? Craigslist?
Thanks for the story, I really hope we can improve the world with this tech.
You're right about the ROI for sure, but to me it's the uncomfortable idea of knowing I profited (handsomely) off of someone trying to feed his family. That just feels amiss to me.
let us know if you figure out anything else we can do $2 /u/tippr  
Socialism is not a thing. Social policies otoh do work and make everybody better off for small price.
And even if he got it in, it'll more than likely get confiscated later, and his family will end up in prison.

"Interesting. I never looked at the prices for ASIC mining before, but it seems that Antminers are pretty comparable to GPU altcoins in profitability per dollar hardware (but lose out on revenue per watt). There seems to be little reason to buy Antminers when you can resell the GPUs for much better rates when you're done mining with them. 

I guess that's likely why you're selling them, though. "

"Hola!

Cryptos are misunderstood by most people, but I guess that could be said about most countries. Now with the new government's ""crypto"" people are even more confused. 

Most people see them as ""videogame currency"" which is funny because even the WOW currency is worth more than the Bolivar.

I didn't payed attention to them until a week ago, and I've been a bit obsessed over it since. Currently in Venezuela there's a paper money shortage, to the point that I couldn't even found enough to pay the bus to college today so I had to go by foot.

Paying with a debit card is scary because you risk being clone, my mom's card was cloned last year.


The US dollar is the de facto currency for anything that's expensive,  for example a phone, bike, car, or house. If real dollars arent exchanged then they use Bolivars but keeping the exchange rate. Because not even banks allows you to place all the necessary 0s when they try to make a transaction.

And that's the issue, being forced to use a currency and being penalized if you dare to use something that works better.

While walking I was thinking of BCH could help, and I remembered a video that was posted here today about a BTC example in Uganda, and it's very similar. The video was about a men that received money from the US to pay for his expenses with the advantages that you didn't had to have a bank account. I think cryptos can work for that too, sure. But maybe even more, since people use dollars to pay for stuff here, instead of risking for the papermoney to be confiscated or stolen, you can use BCH.   It's sad that Venezuela probably is worse than Uganda right now. Now I'm sad."
"Aren't we all trying to feed our families? That's what profit means.

Bitmain profited from you to feed their employees and their families.

You profited by mining amd investing electricity and time to feed yourself and have capital for your family/friends. Profit again by selling.

Buyer starts making money today (instead of waiting 3 months for next batch) to feed their family. Then will profit again when/if he sells.

That feeling is called Good Business. And the guilt is what Liberals and socialists want you to feel instead of pride for creating opportunity for others.

That Venezuelan family profits more by buying from you today, than buying later.

Congrats!

The socialists will have you believe you should redistribute profits to others cuz ""equality"". Many would say that both you and the buyer should distribute a portion of your profits to others that were too lazy/not caring to be involves in the trade. But they are wrong.


I don't feel bad for anyone that I bought ETH at 30 cents (Genesis) and now selling for current prices.

These people that complain to me about ""fairness"" of me making so much money, and now not giving any to them.... **are the same people that I implored to put $100 into BTC/ETH years ago but they didn't give a shit and were too busy jacking off and watching TV and other inane shit**"
"Now I understand what you mean. The profit you make from the sale and BCH in general is not essential for you, you're doing it ""because you like money"". 

Indeed, money can't buy happiness, maybe this is a signal that you need to pledge yourself to some kind of 'good cause' that's close to your heart? "
"Redistribution of my income works better for me? Excuse me?

If voting could change anything it would be illegal.
"Chavez was popular for all the wrong reasons. Maduro won by a very thin margin of 100k votes, in a very controversial vote. Two years later, the congres was voted in, its make-up being 70% opposition. Since then, the charade of democracy was thrown out and they have commited very widespread fraud.

No, I did not vote for Maduro, please do not generalize. "
"Really? How so? Ive seen a lot of venezuelans posting about how mining enabled them to buy food....
"
"> That being said, capitalists can still be empathetic to the buyer without it being influenced by ""socialist propaganda"".

Of course. I mentioned the propaganda possibility because of your self attack and not for anything else. I'm still curious as to why you call yourself greedy and an asshole. Seems a bit rough :("
"> Let me be clear, I'm 100% a greedy capitalist asshole

Can I add something? Capitalism has NOTHING to do with being greedy (or an asshole). This is such a fallacy. Capitalism is about C H O I C E. You can choose what you want! How horrible is that? If a product is so good it compels you to trade your hard earned currency for it then that's an impressive feat, and kudos to the producer for improving a living situation. You can choose to not buy it. The producer can choose to use any profits to feed himself or send 100% to some needy Venezuelans/Haitians/Salvadorans/Pakistanis/... who are not fortunate enough to have such a wise system of governance. It's his choice.

If you're feeling guilty about having excess, then consider reflecting on *why* you have that excess. It's wasn't free. It was a clear gift to posterity from people who set up the system. George Washington after the war could have made himself king. He didn't. Even better consider how to make it so you're not so alone in the world of excess (show others how to get what you've got, a system that provides excess)."
I guess that's true, as long as it costs less to operate than the electricity it consumes. There's a lifespan to these devices as far as efficiency goes.
"yeah.. Ive been getting paid via pp.. you leave a lot of cash on the table.

"check this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9QEkw6_O6w

by selling at the market price, even if currently high, you indicate to the global market (that is, everyone in the world) that there is high demand to build more bitcoin miners, which is much more important for all the people in venezuela and everywhere than just one person, even if his situation is obviously very tough.

"If you sold at the market price, it should be a voluntary transaction for both parties.. and thus no need to feel bad.  

Also.. you are not responsible for all the bad things in the world .. but also it is good if you can help people in some way.

I do really appreciate your post.. because I think there are many places in the world with failing economies [ even western countries have their problems, with poverty and not enough housing ].

My feeling is if people have more control over their own money and it is less curruptible, then that will lead to more commerce, less poverty overall... maybe even less war.

Am interested to hear how cryptos can be used to help in places like VZ.. also I notice DOGE coin is used in places like Pakistan, Cote-d'Ivoire and others.  Very interested to see if it can help these people.

Certainly high fees of BTC make it impossible to use as a currency in developing or under-banked countries... hence the need for BCH."
Good man. I have family from Ecuador. It’s really bad down there now. 
You make some great points here.
"There is plenty of food outside of Venezuela, the economy's just fucked. If this brings something that can be traded to bring more food in, that's an over-all positive.

A lot of that excess is built on government misallocation of resources though. A true free market would not be so inefficient."
huh it didn't work....
Only it's going to happen by people that have even more money and more guns.
After it gets back it's initial investment, it is just a money-generator. It'll pay for its electricity for now.

As of right now, if your electric cost is less than ~$.60/kWh it's profitable.
Agreed. Not ashamed, rather the opposite. I think it opened the dialogue for me on how to do more for their country (and others) while still meeting my goals in crypto.
eBay... that 10% + Paypal fee was brutal too.
crypto isn't just magically saving them? if anything it adds to the instability of their situation :/
Transition will be a bloodbath, though
also they voted in this government, did they not?

I do have more, but I'm not selling them yet. Per twitter, Bitmain is releasing more in a few hours.
Working on it.
"> Greed makes capitalism work. It's efficient and heartless.

The problem is that efficiency very often means centralisation. Those who are ahead have the advantages they need to stay ahead. That's why unbridled capitalism doesn't work either; scale effects tend to prevent competition. (Imagine having a good idea to improve upon Facebook and releasing a new social network to make use of it.)"
"Agreed. Already in the works to do just that, but the point is not that I just feel/felt bad about this one transaction, rather it’s that I allowed myself to get to the point of price gauging.

Seems counterintuitive to the movement."
"You're right that I can't verify what he said, but he had no incentive to lie. He'd already paid, so maybe he was taking me for a spin, but I have no real reason to doubt him.

Also, I don't think I did anything wrong, necessarily. Life has been good to me, and my ""guilt"" (if that's even the right word) was that I haven't done much to help the people in countries who could benefit from low transaction fee coins."
"I only know people online that uses it. And I haven't done any TX with them because of the fear of being a honeypot, I also don't have much to buy stuff from them. People that deal with cryptos here normally are car sellers or house sellers, so they can sell at a dollar price without using the dollar.

I'm still looking if I can find a small local business that accepts it."

>So you are telling me that in Venezuella a family of 4 that cooks, uses some heating, has lights on, computer on, etc, pays $0.04 (four cents) for a monthly electricity bill? 

Venezuela is 30 degrees every.single.day so we don't use heating here lol.

There was a joke when the government raised the gasoline price last year, because it went from being the cheapest in the world to the cheapest in the world lol

some prices from that site are close, but some are way to off. The taki price is plain out wrong. I can get a taxi to another city around 7 km away, I guess, for about $0.40-50 in total.

But taxis are becoming more expensive every week because the repair parts become more expensive. So they charge more than just the gas price.

The average salary is about $7 dollas per month, so when you have that, all the cheap things start to be come more and more expensive for someone who earns the average wage."

"Water depends on the zone, I was unlucky on that side. The zone I live have been with water issues for years, and we only get 1 hour of water per day. Today we only got 30 mins. 

Food is expensive, but at least you can find it. In 2016 we had an extreme scarcity of food to the point I would wait outside of stores for hours just with the hope a food truck would arrive so the store would start selling it. If you didn't do that pre-arrival waiting, you didn't getting anything at all, there wasn't enough food for you. You had to be there before the trucks arrival. This was probably the worse moment of my life. Thank God, in this part things are a bit better, you can find food but it is expensive.

Many only are eating once a day, that's why the increasing lootings. "
"The government finds out about miners in 3 ways:
1. The government owns the country's main internet provider (Cantv). By monitoring internet usage, they can trace the type of internet traffic usually generated by mining operations.
2. The government also owns the country's power providers. They track unusually high demand and inspect in suspicious cases.
3. Snitches. Since mining is ""illegal"", the country's security forces seize any mining rigs they find. The rumour goes the goverment's officials then install these in their own protected farms. There's a big incentive for any connected official to find large-scale mining operations and basically steal the machines.

"Don't need to be sorry, you didn't had anything to do with this, or did you? lol
