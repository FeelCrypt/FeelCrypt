If you could just go ahead and use bitcoin as just a settlement layer, that would be great...
Bitcoin seems to involve a 3 TPS cover sheet :D
So ya got a copy of the upcoming V2 of the memo?  Mmm.  Yeah.  If you could keep that quiet, that would be great.  Don't want that fee market exploding prematurely.  Great.  Buh bye now.
So they read the whitepaper, and then suddenly have a need for decentralized peer to peer cash? What's the application?
\* 5000 sat/bit
perhaps someone told them about Bitcoin, it's this decentralized money idea where many miners around the world control the power between them
New users are spam amirite? 
"For one, they don't risk getting their transactions blocked, as for all transactions to wikileaks via paypal, visa, mastercard. Or maybe they don't want to pay salaries to fat banksters who are the ones who get bailouts from people's tax money. Or maybe they don't trust venmo to handle their money. 

There are a lot of  applications. "
Um, idk - maybe people who've read this: https://bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf
"A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash that would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution?? What?! Satoshi never said anything about peer-to-peer, nor mentioned it in the white pa....(oh wait). D-oh! I read too fast. Title and first sentence, first paragraph of the white paper by the creator of bitcoin Satoshi Nakamoto. ""Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System"""
Except for the ridiculous $30b market cap
We need to talk about your flair, ok?  Now, its up to you  if you want to do just the bare minimum...or, well like Luke over there, for example, has got his UASF hat on, and a terrific smile. Look, people can get crypto anywhere, ok?  They come to Bitcoin  for the great features and the attitude.
Uh, we have sort of a problem here.  You appraently didn't put one of the new 5000 sat/byte fees on your transaction.  Umm, yeah, we're putting those 5000 sat/byte fees on all our transactions now.  Did you... see the memo about this?  Yeaaah.  If you could just go ahead and make sure you do that from now on, that would be great.  And I'll make sure you get another copy of that memo, mmkay?  Buh bye now.
New user here, old time lurker of bitcoin. Tried mining back in the day(pre 2014). Basically it is as simple as bitcoin is kool and PayPal is lame.
"Cross-border payments? Remittances?  Online commerce without the burden of a bank account?  Financial inclusion for the unbanked in the global economy?  Machine to machine payments?


What about government/corporate control over the means of exchange?  You're honestly saying ""they have Venmo or PayPal so they should be fine""?  You realize the whole point here is to be transacting in something *other* than fiat money right?  ""Chancellor on the Brink of Second Bailout for Banks""?  No?"
Sad but true. Bitcoin has NOTHING going for it at this time. 
"Who are these theoretical new users that are getting into bitcoin for peer to peer cash purposes? Do they not have venmo or paypal? 

What peer to peer cash application are they going for?

"
Bitcoin can remain (or become again) a decentralized currency, but it can only do this without full blocks
"Why just 8mb? we want to cover all the earth population's coffees asap!!!

PLEASE stop this bullshit! if we let Jihan to manage a single very powerfull node we can have 128mb rigth NOW!!!

Roger convince Stephen to increase to 128mb please! WE LOVE YOUUUUU!!!!! THANKS"
"That's why it's proposed to do it at 75%.  
Also keep in mind that it's much more problematic if you stay at 1MB, since the network would become even more congested."
That's the miners decision, of which <10 people pretty much control >90% of the network. So no, its not our decision. 
"> (apart from xthin added in) 

Exactly that's the problem... Lots of buggy additional code....
"
It isn't that decentralization is too expensive, it's that this particular implementation of decentralization is too expensive
[deleted]
Isn't this essentially what BU is? (apart from xthin added in)
"> you and other big blockers are advocating are chain splits,

Far from it. Rather the opposite.

> segwit

stupid talk. 4 megs for nothing.
"
Another workaround could be for BitPay to add a prepaid payment service. It's certainly not ideal in the long run, but it would be better than not doing anything.
"Yeah,high fees and long confirmation times aren't so great for most bitcoin business.

 If there's a silver lining, however, people new to bitcoin, let's say  those that showed up starting 2017, this new ""more expensive and slower to confirm bitcoin"" is all they know. Since they continue to arrive to bitcoin in droves, soon this new generation of bitcoin users with lower expectations from bitcoin performance/cost  will outnumber the old timers living in their ""those were the good ol' days"" frame of mind. I guess there'll be less rage at that time, because no one rages at something they've voluntarily entered if that's all they've ever known.

OK, maybe that's not a silver lining, but would you settle for a bronze lining?"
No i actually dont know it. Because what you and other big blockers are advocating are chain splits, you just dont know it or you refuse to realise it. Basically if you want bigger blocks but want to avoid a chain split you go for segwit. It is the least contentious and thus least likely to cause a split because its a softfork. This is what the evidence suggests.
"If there is a real demand from real users. Stephen can fork off anytime, the user base along will attract miners.

Miners follow the money. They can create whatever protocol they want, but if users don't want it then their protocol won't be worth anything."
If bitcoin is like the internet, then blockstream core is desperately trying to force NAT on everyone, a hacky kludge that stalled the real scaling solution of ipv6. Don't let them implement their retrograde agenda. 
When there was no backlog that was true. Now, I dunno...
This is already how it works, but with a cap of 1MB
"Sure, I don't disagree with what he's saying.

I'm usually not a fan of all the tweet posts because I don't think 140 character arguments really add a lot to a multi year debate. But I'm making an acception with my upvotes here because the march of Pairs is an amusing sight."
Eh. Even if SegWit was Bitcoin's panacea, I wouldn't expect Litecoin's price to skyrocket with its addition. They never had full blocks to suppress demand. 
Just look at all the technical problems that have resulted from adopting Segwit just like half of /r/btc has been promising would happen. /s
"Even I'm a bigger fan of a straight 8MB increase than anything involving the broken EC model implemented in BU.

My point, and Stephen's: You guys really need to get away from BU. Completely."
They could until the backlog cleared but I doubt they would.  Better to ramp up size slowly for them to make sure they don't get orphans.
lol
"Nahh, he just has some common sense, decency, and sincerity. Something many today's ""visionaries"" are sorely lacking.
"
Yeah, he has been flip flopping all over the place. 
">Even I'm a bigger fan of a straight 8MB increase than anything involving the broken EC model implemented in BU.

Well me too,

Actually would prefer a block limit calculated according to the median of the last 100 blocks *a la Monero*

But it is interesting to note that BU node will follow those chain if they have majority hash power.

>My point, and Stephen's: You guys really need to get away from BU. Completely.

Was he ever involved in BU?"
"> My point, and Stephen's: You guys really need to get away from BU. Completely.

Only if you get away from Segwit. Completely.

Deal? "
That was semi-sarcastic since Hearn was one of the primary developers and advocates for Bitcoin XT back then.  Though, yes, it was obvious to many people then that the blocksize needed to be raised.  And yet, here we are.
">Was he ever involved in BU?

No. I think that he, like me, has smartly avoided it from the beginning.

>Actually would prefer a block limit calculated according to the median of the last 100 blocks a la Monero.

Ok, NOW we're on the right track. Ironically, I believe that's the *type* of deterministic solution Core itself will likely implement eventually. Not the same, but similar."
"No deal. SegWit is a perfectly acceptable stop-gap solution until we discover a more deterministic solution for the long-term. It's tested, implemented, and most major businesses have already upgraded their services and apps to SegWit.

Whatever deterministic solution we eventually settle on for scaling, it will have to be one that doesn't dramatically accelerate the trend toward centralization. That alone is a complete deal-breaker."
"My goal is to stop BU from destroying the network.

I used the quote above to emphasize that point.

Everything is ""about BU"" because that is the flawed concept and code that this sub mistakenly rallied behind during the last six months. 

I would have never left the big block camp if it wasn't for that terrible decision.

Join me in stopping it."
I just lately looked into XT and discovered to my amazement that XT nodes relay double spends which is absolutely awesome from the point of view of an economic node. It's much better than being kept in dark about the fact that someone double spends on me and only learning about it when the damage has been done and double spend got confirmed.
"Why is everything about BU to you guys?   

It's almost as if you know there are legitimate opposing viewpoints but you desperately cling to BU sucking, to try and negate any and all opposing viewpoints. 

It's not working."
you can fork it. 
"That. Would. Be. Amazing. 

Can we please do this somehow? Pretty please?"
"Another idea:

How about - 

Hard fork, merge-mined with original Bitcoin, BitPay agrees to accept payment in it (still also accepting original bitcoin), Bitmain agrees to merge-mine it (still also mining original bitcoin).


Olivier Janssens /u/olivierjanss had a leaked document with this proposal a few months ago. (now deleted)
http://archive.is/2017.03.26-155453/https://medium.com/@olivierjanss/15df2f0cc7f7#selection-119.0-116.1


With Bitpay/Bitmain support it could be a runner. It doesn't require permission from any of the obstructionists and has little downside risk for Bitpay or Bitmain.
"
First 2MB, then suddenly 8MB... Why not try 4MB? Really, make a choice....
"I am a big block supporter, but I would not jump to 8MB in one shot.

"
"[You forgot to include this quote that's also from Stephen Pair:](https://letstalkbitcoin.com/blog/post/lets-talk-bitcoin-325)  (at 29:54)  

>**So we don't like a contentious hard fork... we could deal with a hard fork that is not contentious... but a contentious hard fork, we can't do that. I'll also say we are very concerned about this concept of emergent consensus and Bitcoin Unlimited. Personally my sense is that it's not a good idea. And I would say it's definitely not a good experiment to put on the Bitcoin blockchain.**"
"Yeah, almost 2 years of ""debate"" and we are back to Bitcoin XT original plan. I'm on board."
"It should be mentioned for the simpleminded that an 8MB limit doesn't mean miners will create 8MB blocks out of the gate. 

I know that you know, I just felt like it needed spelling out. "
Hearn was a visionary.
[deleted]
Limit, not requirement. Capacity is only used if needed.
"Litecoin has had effectively 8 MB blocks for years now hasnt it??

8MB blocks are a SMASHING success on Litecoin.  Well tested!  Let's put them on Bitcoin!"
"Well yeah he advocates for 8MB not BU did you read the tweet?

(BU is compatible with 8MB BTW)"
"That's how one by one former Core supporters turn away.

So.. economical majority much? businesses are Segwit-ready much?"
Actually, the OP is a good suggestion. 
Looks like you are not aware of SW major drawbacks. That's OK you don't need to know but don't ask yourself why it failed to be implemented.
