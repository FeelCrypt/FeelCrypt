I think you're taking that quote a bit too literally. 
nicely put. now if we could get our North Korean leader u/theymos to allow discussion that would be a good start. 
People who live their lives by quaint little sayings disturb me. It evinces intellectual laziness.
I posted that not to be taken literally, I posted it as a reminder that we should all look at data and stop attacking people or holding them up as prophet's simply for expressing ideas. 
that's good news. I found it ironic that both those posts occupied the top two spots though. I was looking at the ratio of up and down votes and that was some what reassuring too.

But you don't want bitcoin to accommodate more people because religion. 
"Externally, sure, but this more recent internal power struggle simply didn't exist back then.

The community was much more focused on how we were going to change the world. Now, it's more about how we can deal with the scaling situation (an issue that most of us had expected to have been at least partially resolved by now) all while the rest of the world (both within and outside the crypto-sphere) plays catch up."
Are you sure Lightning cannot do multisig? :/
This is incorrect, SegWit does not introduce any new data that wasn't already there before. Under SegWit a 1MB block + 3MB witness data would be equivalent to a 4MB big block.
That's thirty-thousand fucking dollars. 
Segwit makes multisig transactions especially cheaper was my point. Not anything to do with storage size and nodes, etc. 
"Greg says that SegWit is not required for Lightning. Now you're saying *""Only works on segwit-capable networks""*. Which is it?"
So then deploy segwit. Oh wait, you Core guys are masters at stalling.
"I don't understand how there cannot ever be a stalemate though, even with voting mechanisms.

Is everything a binary yes or no, and if so, do things always approve at 51%? Couldn't that potentially be bad?

What makes the Eth foundation different than the Btc foundation, or the Core developer ""group""? Is there no way for that to ever be co-opted?"
"LN should be **a** solution. Not the solution.

Bitcoin must remain independent. Changes to the Bitcoin protocol that move fees off the blockchain and onto second layer solutions are a direct threat to bitcoin's survival."
I remember being so jealous of Americans because from Australia I had to jump through so many hoops back then before I could buy coins. I remember thinking, I can't wait for bitinstant to be available in Australia :) 
my comment applies to the funders in that scenario as well as those who will harm somebody's reputation for pay.  I don't see how the negative campaigning helps anyone, it certainly wouldn't make me want to patron those that stand to gain from such behavior even if I found some truth in their mud. 
Okay, that's a point. I was considering the case where an innocent man is forced to plea.
Well said. I think if people understood this there would be no debates. 
I payed $0.15 for my last tx, way less than 2.9% +$0.30. If are paying PayPal level fees with bitcoin you are doing something wrong, no religion required.
As far as I could tell in 2011 -- Bitcoin was always going to be a political game until it becomes accepted along the lines of how the internet was accepted by the masses.
Thanks for saying that, it means more to me than you know 
Unfortunately I don't think this is a bitcoin problem. I've been seeing so much of that attitude lately all over reddit.. 
Except that they can't use a tool like lightning so they still can't fit their transaction in a block.
True, but that just postpones the issue - main problem is that as far as I know, lightning can't do multisig. On-chain payments will be expensive one way or another
"So you essentially concede that 8M blocks would be much better than SegWit, 2.5x the capacity and no technical debt or major code additions prone to contain bugs, thanks

> you'd likely get to 3 MB blocks

So why not simply raise the block size to 3M to get the same effect with the same bandwidth requirements and much less risk? It's extremely simple to do in code too without a risk of introducing bugs .. I thought you cared about minimizing risks, no?

And the effect is immediate, without the need to change how clients process transactions at all businesses, wallets, exchanges or users ... more ideal solution all around, no?"
correction, 3MB of data per 1MB block. 
This shit is so bad everywhere and with everything I just miss out on info because it's impossible to weed out the shit. 
"You mean like Bitcoin Unlimited?  Where on chain fees will be back down to comfortable levels.
"
30 pieces of silver
I absolutely respectfully disagree.
"Not to mention when PoS arrives to Ethereum it will be the end of the miners strangle hold on the project and it will be the coin holders themself that will approve hard & soft forks. 

"
"No one will. It's only a threat that Core fundamentalists make.

here is how it works according to the designer Shatoshi - he states in the Bitcoin white paper:

>Nodes always consider the longest chain to be the correct one and will keep working on
extending it. If two nodes broadcast different versions of the next block simultaneously, some
nodes may receive one or the other first. In that case, they work on the first one they received,
but save the other branch in case it becomes longer. The tie will be broken when the next proofof-work
is found and one branch becomes longer; the nodes that were working on the other
branch will then switch to the longer one.

So those calling a fork or BU an altcoin or extending an orphan chain don't actually understand how bitcoin works. 

When BU gets more than an average of 50.01% hashpower, and can sustain it, miners can safely move the block limit. BU is one safe way of doing it as described in the White Paper. https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf. 

save a copy because the Core Fundamentalists are wanting to change Satoshi's White Paper to reflect the changes they are making. 
"
"Some people have stated they would dig their heels in and support a minority chain purely on idealogical grounds. This says to me that the incentive structure of Bitcoin is broken.

The key thing though is that the incentive structure is heavily geared towards miners, not node operators. As long as all the major miners work on the same chain I can't see a minority chain getting any traction. Sure the idealogical node operators would stay connected to it, but there would not be enough hash rate to build on it - they would be forced to perform a hard fork to reset the difficulty. Doing so would only make the minority chain more obscure and insignificant.

That's my theory anyway."
"> I agree that the priority is censorship resistance. That is why I am against Lightning Network. LN in order to be efficient, centralizes Bitcoin into big payment hubs.

Lighting is a layer 2 on top of Bitcoin.  It shouldn't impact the resistance of the underlying layer much.  I agree that Lightning may have centralized hubs, but that doesn't really bother me, many people used centralized Bitcoin banks now, having these as lighting hubs is far better than these banks which can steal or lose user funds.

> On the other hand, incresing the block size to 2 Mb does not centralize Bitcoin because CPU power, internet bandwith and data storage are more than 2 times bigger than 8 years ago.

I agree that 2MB would be great.  It is therefore very lucky that pretty much everyone is happy increasing the blocksize to 2MB then, otherwise it would be very difficult to do and may not have happened.  It is also great the Core team has found a way of doing this that is very fast, such that we do not even wait for other users to upgrade before enjoying the benefits of twice the scale, but still using the same chain and being fully compatible with these non upgraded users.

The other great thing about the SegWit 2.1MB onchain scaling proposal, is it also solves the quadratic hashing problem, this means we can then increase the blocksize even further after SegWit has activated, without increasing the risk of very hard to validate blocks that much
"
"> why LN then?

Why LN what?  Why is LN a good idea?  

I think LN is good because it can allow very fast settlement of payments, e.g. microseconds rather than hours Bitcoin's main consensus mechanism can take.  The other main advantage is that capacity can be much greater, this is because in LN, transaction data only needs to be exchanged between a few parties who are directly involved in the transaction, with Bitcoin's blockchain only used if things go wrong as a fail-safe.  In contrast, with Bitcoin's base layer, the data needs to be broadcast to, downloaded by, verified and stored by all participants in the system, this has inherent disadvantages when it comes to capacity. (Although despite these weaknesses, luckily pretty much everyone agrees with you and I that we can and should at least double the current 1MB limit, I wish it was done sooner, but luckily it looks like it might happen soon)

So I think LN is considered a win win type of solution.  One can use the bitcoin token for instant payments with high capacity, but we don't compromise the censorship resistance on the underlying Bitcoin layer itself."
That's a different topic all together. I am not defending those actions. He didn't accept money directly from these people, rather it was traced via transaction history to be linked. Kind of hypocritical of the US to convict him for something they do themselves, though.
How many years did you do out of principle?

"> No one will. It's only a threat that Core fundamentalists make.

There are at least 4 known people who will launch an economic attack on the Bitcoin Unlimited chain. Several brokers aim to make a killing facilitating this attack, so it's not an empty threat but a declaration of war.

>So those calling a fork or BU an altcoin or extending an orphan chain don't actually understand how bitcoin works.

And you know exactly how Bitcoin works? You're an expert? You are a quintessential resource of intellect that drives our brightest minds forward so humanity can reach for the stars? Your anti-socratic sentiment is most unwise.

>When BU gets more than an average of 50.01% hashpower, and can sustain it, miners can safely move the block limit. 

Yes and what 70% of the network orphans them? Where is the federation of large services (like LocalBitcoins), pledging to support the Bitcoin Unlimited ruleset? If BU gets > 50% hash rate, thinks its safe to fork and miners create a > 1mb block, that block will be orphaned by those who don't want to upgrade.

You answer to this will be predictable, ""They'll be 'incentivized' to upgrade"", which is tantamount to fascism.

You have no idea how to ""safely hard fork"" the network because you can't accurately predict who is going to be a hold out. But hey believe what you want! The word of Satoshi and his holy words will guide you to the promise land!"
"The Core could have had as much LN as they want if they wouldn't have been stupid enough to fool the miners. We would have big blocks and Segwit/LN now. Now we have nothing. But this is better, because more and more miners realize what kind of people are working at BSCore. 
"
This is what I'm talking about, why attack me for posting a quote and saying I live my life by quotes. Seriously where did the notion of be excellent to each other go? :/ sad
I don't know.
You misunderstand. Let me re-phrase. If you have a segwit block that is 1MB transaction data and 3MB witness data, you would need 4 regular 1MB blocks in order to contain the same number of transactions.
I think both of us want what is best for Bitcoin and ultimately, we just see it from different perspectives.
Thanks yeah I'm aware of that. My comment was more about the mixed messages coming out of Core.
"This can actually be a situation where something like the ETH/ETC split is a *good thing*. If there's some sort of disagreement over a protocol change that simply cannot be reconciled between the two camps and that has no clear consensus, splitting into two blockchains means that everyone gets what they want. In the end the market decides which choice.

PoS can help this process by making it impossible for the two chains to 51% attack each other. Stakers must choose which of the two chains they will back, and they lose their stake on the other chain. There's no possibility for them to flip-flop."
"> I am not sure why you are relating LN to anything. Think of LN as a separate issue from whatever stupid dispute we are having.

Because we are not stupid. Anything that opposes segwit/LN is getting censored on the BSCore 'communication' channels. They're capping the Bitcoin Blockchain to enforce the txs/fees into the LN via segwit.

> Lets assume they are evil people, why would that matter? 

Assume? Everybody knows that people who support censorship and banning are evil, and no one should run and promote the implementation of evil people. "

">on-chain scaling leads done the path of centralization.

there is no basis for such a claim.

"LOL centralized control of the reference client and forcing experimental soft fork protocol changes on the network is centralized console. 

the way to do it would be to have the reference client be the basic protocol and soft fork implementation based of the reference client all competing on their own merit. 

we all know if we had Google data center type tragic to deal with today bitcoin would be centralized, but we don't and there is no need to limit the network to 1MB with we know 4 or 10 MB blocks would have no issues. "
Apparently it's possible and there was some work on it in the past, but current implementations do not yet support it.
The chart shows block size/tps/time, does BU change how many transactions fit onto a 1mb block, or does it just make the blocks bigger? 
"I think that for a split to happen (and even a split to be a good thing), there should be some very fundamental disagreements.  There may be a 50/50-division on weather to paint a bike shed blue or red, but the opinions are rarely so strong that one goes ahead and builds two bikesheds instead of one.

I can't understand how we have let the block size limit become such a big controversy - but apparently there are people fanatic enough to stick to the 1MB-limit even if miners would adopt BU."
"> Because we are not stupid. Anything that opposes segwit/LN is getting censored on the BSCore 'communication' channels.

> They're capping the Bitcoin Blockchain to enforce the txs/fees into the LN via segwit.

SegWit fixes a bad bug, malleability, which may make it easier to build LN.  Are you saying you like the malleability bug?

That is ridiculousness.  What if an evil/racist engineer/scientist developed the lightbulb, electricity, the linear actuator or any idea or technology, would you boycott these two!!  That is an entirely illogical and irrational point of view.

it'f fact. its already happening. your just too fundamentally obsessed with restricting block size to even see it.

Small blockers have been opposing this for years. Now they want us to support SegWit saying it is a block increase.

And the problem comes again when the technology allows to process 100MB blocks. They will not support any further blocksize increase.

Bitcoin Unlimited solves this problem for good without removing fees from main blockchain. No need for LN. No need for segwit as a softfork.

> The other great thing about the SegWit

I agree SegWit tackles some problems. That is why those problems are solved with Bitcoin Unlimited too in a clean elegant way as a hard fork. No need to use ugly complicated softfork hacks.

FYI a block is the transaction data what is written to the blockchain.

"> Is everything a binary yes or no, and if so, do things always approve at 51%? Couldn't that potentially be bad?

Absolutely.  If the community is divided, the approval rate can oscillate between 49.9% and 50.1%.  It's very bad to make irreversible decisions based on that.

There are traditionally two ways to deal with this; one is to require i.e. 66% or 75% majority for doing significant changes, the other is to require a steady majority; i.e. that a proposal has more than 50% support for more than a year.  Both approaches will work out, but a threshold bigger than 75%  for introducing changes can easily mean that changes won't happen.  I.e. with a 95%-threshold it may be affordable for some saboteur to buy up a 6%-stake just to block any progress."

"> LN charge fees that are not paid to miners removing security from Bitcoin blockchain.

If the LN transaction fails then you need to revert to the blockchain and pay a fee to the miners...

> Small blockers have been opposing this for years. 

That is false nonsense, everyone has wanted more capacity and larger blocks.  See BIP103 for example

> Now they want us to support SegWit saying it is a block increase.

Segwit is both effectively AND literally, a blocksize increase.  It doesnt matter if somebody says it is or is not a blocksize increase.  SegWit is factually a blocksize increase.

> Bitcoin Unlimited solves this problem for good

Bitcoin Unlimited is a divergent and flawed system.  BU opens up new devastating attack vectors and abandons the fundamental convergence Bitcoin has which makes it work.  Nor does it help with the inherent scaling issues, that users need to download, propagate, verify and store all the transaction data.

> No need for LN

If people want to use LN they can, if they don't they won't.  I dont see why BU impacts that.

> those problems are solved with Bitcoin Unlimited too in a clean elegant way as a hard fork

BU does not solve malleability or quadratic hashing.  A hardfork is a tool to achive something, not an objective itself

> No need to use ugly complicated softfork hacks.

I am not sure I follow the logic here.  This is FUD.  There have been 6  softforks in the last 18 months or so.

my favorite rant: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLG9g7BcjKs"
"I was thinking a bit about this, and came to think that the US election system may be to blame.

Say there are three candidates wanting to be president, A, B and C - where A is the most popular and C is the least popular - and most of those preferring C to become the president would prefer B over A.

Since the president is elected on a simple majority, it doesn't make sense at all voting for C - any C-supporters should forget about C and vote for B instead.

So we've come down to that it doesn't matter which candidate you would *like* to become a president.  What really matters is which candidate you *would not like* to become the president.  If you would not like A to become the president, you need to vote for B, even if you think C would be a great president.

This again means that successful campaigning for A and B will not be so much about promoting the ideas of A and B, but rather about smearing B and A with dirt.

Rinse and repeat through multiple president elections, and for each election the campaigning and peoples mentality will be just more and more cynic."
Ahh, the price, the price. It just protects the system, it doesn't really mean anything, if you believe in our glorious coin. The important thing is we don't want the system shackled. What will you say when we have two billion users, there has been no progress on the network side (we still use 1 Gb/s links or less), and the fees are high as now. Is it a fiasco? No, the difference from now is that in stead of 10 million we have 2 billion users. Same fees, a better system.
"> Turning Bitcoin into PayPal to compete on PayPal's strengths would just be stupid.

I totally agree.  The smart thing to do is to prioritize where you have a sustainable  comparative advantage, which for Bitcoin is censorship resistant transactions and crucially censorship resistant protocol rules for the money.  Of course fast and cheap transactions would be great to, but we should be strategic about what is the priority, otherwise we could be stuck in the middle, in a weak strategic position. "
This! I've never had to pay a fee with PayPal, so Bitcoin was always more telling expensive than PayPal to begin with. 
Ethereum can do it.
Oh well. I won't be surprised if it turns out PayPal is cheaper than Bitcoin. It's far more efficient, after all. Bitcoin is good at *trustless security*, not efficiency. Some will argue centralised systems have high regulatory costs, but only time will tell which costs are higher. Turning Bitcoin into PayPal to compete on PayPal's strengths would just be stupid.

"Increasing the block size without creating scalability would convert Bitcoin into a wasteful, pointless Paypal.

Increasing the blocksize now serves no other purpose than making transactions cheaper temporarily for us lucky, early Bitcoiners.

Don't whine and beg. Build the Bitcoin you want."
Does it have to be a hard fork?  Core I think is deathly afraid of it splitting into two coins like ether did. Bitcoin Unlimited wants to split I think... I want bigger blocks but not at the expense of splitting bitcoin...  I would rather see Unlimited simply take over the whole thing or Core to just increase the block size already like you said you would!

"Do not listen to Core. You will never have 2 bitcoin networks. Sure they will say technically some dumb asses will stay on the weaker chain but its the same as some dumb asses decide to burn money. 

Oh and their threat of changing POW algorithm is cute."
BS/Core are spreading the FUD, it can be safe and painless it's not an issue unless you make it one. Bitcoin deals with forks every day the longest chain wins and no one suffers a loss. 
Core v0.13.1 already included a block size increase to 2-3 MB. It's up to miners to deploy it now.
"> Increasing the block size without creating scalability would convert Bitcoin into a wasteful, pointless Paypal.

please esplanade how? ( i suspect your just regurgitating unsubstantiated propaganda) 

it has nothing to do with transaction cost its about growing the network of users. see this: https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5ozdmw/charlie_shrem_on_twitter_if_we_dont_implement/dcnb2p4/

"
">Here's a little secret: sellers usually pass CC/paypal fees onto consumers. They're integrated into the price. 

But that price remains the same regardless of payment method. Which makes paying with bitcoin trebly expensive - you pay the same higher price, higher tx fees, and you forgo cash back / other rewards. "
"bitcoin transactions increase exponentially as more users adopt bitcoin. more users that adopt bitcoin the higher the price of bitcoin.  

This is an argued problem because we have technological constraints and if we allow bitcoin to grow it will fall under control of huge data centers resulting in centralized control. There are lots more arguments and counter arguments (creative people have been inventing arguments for the last 5 years - we are at a stale mate.)  small block proponents want to change the bitcoin protocol to grow demand using other networks that are not bitcoin like the Lightening Network. Large block proponents what to allow bitcoin to grow organically. 

Satoshi introduced a soft fork limit of 1MB, small block proponents argue that removing the 1MB limit is a change because it requires a coordinated network upgrade known as a hard fork. Small block proponents say we don't need a hard fork change we can introduce a soft fork change (segwit) that allows bitcoin to scale with 3rd party solutions like the Lightening network and no coordinated network upgrade is needed as coordinated network upgrade are dangerous.   

For the longest time I felt Satoshi the inventor of bitcoin was wrong when he said: [By Moore's Law, we can expect hardware speed to be 10 times faster in 5 years and 100 times faster in 10. Even if Bitcoin grows at crazy adoption rates, I think computer speeds will stay ahead of the number of transactions.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3z0xod/satoshi_by_moores_law_we_can_expect_hardware/)

turns out transaction growth rate has been amazing however technology is improving faster as we can see: [Seagate's 60TB SSD comes a year after Samsung's 15TB SSD.](http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/08/seagate-unveils-60tb-ssd-the-worlds-largest-hard-drive/) and [1.4 Tbps with commercial-grade hardware.](http://gizmodo.com/the-fastest-real-world-internet-is-1000x-quicker-than-g-1506564949)

so with today technology we wouldn't need to upgrade for the next 10 years if we had 100MB blocks (currently limited to 1MB) it would be decades before we'd see dedicated computer room - let alone a data center.  (technological constants aren't going to force centralized control any time soon) 

when we look at [this chart](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/21mw7b/bitcoin_vs_metcalfes_law/) we see that the number of transactions is closely correlated with price.

when we look at [this chart](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3x8ba9/bitcoins_metcalfes_law_relationship_between/) - when full blocks start the correlation breaks down. 

[here is another graph showing exponential block size predictions](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3ame17/a_payment_network_for_planet_earth_visualizing/) 

bitcoin developers who are small block proponents are mostly employed by Blockstream the majority of their funding is from the second largest transnational corporation on the planet AXA. They pay most of the lead developers of Bitcoin Core, developers who disagree with them have been forced out of the team or left in frustration claiming bitcoin is doomed. Bitcoin is for all practical purposes under their centralized control. 

Criticism of this centralized control is not tolerated on the majority of the bitcoin communication platforms, r/btc being one place where freedom of speech is allowed however it comes at the cost of excessive trolling.
This article has a great summary of where we are at: https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/bitcoin-unlimited-headed-activation/

In short Gavin Andresen the second to Satoshi - [one kicked out of Core released this Fun fact](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5nefwf/gavin_andresen_on_twitter_fun_fact/)  it is funny because most web paged are bigger than the 1MB block limit and the miners who say blocks can't be bigger than 1MB have home pages bigger than 1MB, their argument to keep the block size below 1 MB being home users wont be able to download anything bigger than 1MB every 10 minutes and will force centralization - and those miners who say let more users use the blockchain and lets move the limit are more efficient with there data usage:

Size (MB) homepages:

bitfury: 1.5
blockstream: 1.9
btcc: 2.4

blockchain: 0.2
coinbase: 0.9
viabtc: 0.2

No one has put effort into extending an orphan chain before. You really think people with the same capitalization as Ver who are against this nonsense won't fight back to preserve themselves?
If you are talking about governance models, and consensus failure other crypto *have* already overcome this problem. Dash has supernodes which balance out miners with a built in voting mechanism and works beautifully.  As /u/sammiedata says Ethereum has the ETH foundation which in a way puts it half way between something like ripple and bitcoin. 
Just another purging of the old guard
"that's nonsense blocks are still limited to 1MB, if they were not they would be forked off. 

"
That's not accurate and you know it. Only segwit transactions can fit in the additional space.
Have you, Peter or Matt written the 2mb hard fork code like you promised?
"That dishonest and you've more or less become an internet troll with your persistence of dishonesty; honestly I think most of us used to have some respect for you but that's all gone now. It's quite a shame what has happened"
You are paying hidden fees with PayPal. How do you think PayPal makes money?
Paypal definitely has fees but they choose the rate so you are never aware of it. With bitcoin, you decide the rate, so it's more evident what you're doing when you make a transaction. 
"I agree that the priority is censorship resistance. That is why I am against Lightning Network. LN in order to be efficient, centralizes Bitcoin into big payment hubs.

On the other hand, incresing the block size to 2 Mb does not centralize Bitcoin because CPU power, internet bandwith and data storage are more than 2 times bigger than 8 years ago.

"
why LN then? 
Shrem was busted telling people how to launder money through his company while telling them using his company email address. The guy isn't exactly bright. Now he wants people to invest in his Ethereum garbage collection company ICO or some shit. 
Or do your time like a man and not snitch. 
Poor Charlie, it is as if he missed the memo that the paymasters decided that big blocks (and flourishing Bitcoin) are supposed to be uncool.
That's assuming these are genuine unpaid people.

">[""Great minds discuss ideas; average minds discuss events; small minds discuss people.""](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/5ow0fy/great_minds_discuss_ideas_average_minds_discuss/) 

>the second post mocking Roger after being banned. I realize I'm stooping to the level of discussing events but the hypocrisy is so blatant - and the depressing thing is it's celebrated while more rational voices are banned from posting over there. 
 
There's no such thing as ""great minds discuss ideas, average minds discuss events and small minds discuss people"" as the link you provided claims. Even great philosophers eat, pee and poop just like everyone else. Everyone except maybe Our Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un who is so holy that he does not even have a butt hole (source: https://youtu.be/yzt0IACxlFA).

So for everyone except Kim, it's perfectly fine to discuss ideas, events *and* people. The alternative would be absurd, because try to imagine a world without anyone ever discussing any events or any person, just ideas. It wouldn't work. Who would you vote for becoming president for example if discussing people is beneath your great mind? You wouldn't be able to choose a candidate on your ballot because you'd never have heard about the people called Bernie, Hillary or Donald.

I'd say that a well functioning ""great mind"" has to discuss *all* of those things. Ideas, events and people are all equally important topics to discuss. "
To be fair, the first post got upvoted in response to the second.
Tell me about it - I was banned for asking someone to kindly die in a fire.  KINDLY!
If you ever read some of the (I assume) paid hillary supporters on r/politics leading up to the election, there's a similar feel to it. Maybe the Fed is funding them, or some other body committed to bitcoin's failure. . 
"they feel threatened, the result is they are being manipulated.

"
No. But I do see hundreds of people angry that they are being censored. r/bitcoin mods create a bunch by banning rational voices whenever they want to make your point.
"I would agree before, but now that Ethereum made the sacrifice and suffered for it, it became more or less immune to this sort of problem.

We can be pretty much sure that if they have an irreconcilable disagreement or an undecidable technical question, they will divide into two competing processes. What better way to get rid of paralyzing inner politics?
"
"> If Bitcoin fails to overcome this challenge, I don't think any crypto will that isn't centrally managed like Ripple.

That's incredibly short sighted, the Ethereum Foundation is strongly committed to scaling Eth. 

Just because Core refuses upgrade Bitcoin doesn't mean other crypto projects have the same problem.

"> Overpaying doesn't really hurt

Bitcoin users may think differently, you know the ones that actually use Bitcoin, but there probably shouldn't be much concern for those, they are just spam after all anyway "
All of the original Bitcoin players are vehemently against what is going on. That tells me something.  They are the ones I'd listen to. 
OB supports altcoins. Guess which coin out of the first ten is best suitable for replacing BTC for everyday transactions? If used for payments, it will also be pretty good as a store of value since everyone will own some to avoid constant conversions from BTC or fiat.
Note that such transactions benefit more from segwit than normal ones. So if everyone was using Openbazaar or other multisig transactions regularly, you'd likely get to 3 MB blocks.
Tell me how you are using bitcoin as a religion. 
No need, we don't want your code
Only if there was some piece of technology out there that helps with that... *scratches chin*
">Thankfully, we have Lightning.

Where?"
It's been such a mentally taxing experience. I got into Bitcoin to avoid petty politics, now we're smack dab in the middle of it.

Yeah, with non-working large scale routing and multiple orders of magnitude more complex than just changing a number 1 to 8, great ""solution"" /s

why implement a simple safe solution when you have overly convoluted non-working one, makes sense, Core logic in all its glory ..."
"Not all of them.  Core seems to retain support from some people I respect like Stephen Pair and Charlie Lee, but here is a depressing list for you...

Like Gavin Andresen. He is not original Bitcoin player either? I will not be surprised if you say Satoshi is not original player.

It's great if you're a miner but not great if you're a user - it's causing up to $200 USD of unnecessary fees per block (if every tx has a fee based on it). That's $28k/day..
"> Overpaying doesn't really hurt, though.

I think there are a lot of businesses out there that would disagree with you. Comments like this only lend weight to the accusation that Core are out of touch with business concerns."
There you have it. Blockstream wants to disable functionality to build a monetized solution instead. Obvious conflict of interest. You guys don't even know how the routing will work but claim its an en all solution. 
"I appreciate you speaking your mind about Bitcoin-related issues, regardless of what your position is, because we all have a lot of respect for what you've done to promote Bitcoin. There is no way we're going to get anywhere good without the dialogue, and the current atmosphere of recriminations and branding people ""attackers"" simply on the basis of their current opinions is unspeakably disgusting."
