In person search is a search of pockets etc incl a frisk/patdown. I think they can even request you do some kind of machine scan to make sure you're not hiding drugs in your ass. That's why bringing back more than $10K in cash is a bad idea as they can confiscate it. Bitcoin is OK if you just remember the seed (e.g. use the words from a specific page/s in a book or something).

Laszlo Hanyeckz (sp?) made the first real-world purchase of an item with Bitcoin in exchange for pizza on May 17, 2010. Two pizzas cost him a total of 10000 BTC. It's a part of crypto lore.
read again what I wrote above, it explains to you why that would be a extrmely foolish thing to do. The only way to guarantee that you would pay up would be to put the money in some kind of excrow now, do you understand that ?
"It didn't get consensus though. When one of two sides in a fork has vastly less support than the other, it cannot claim to be the original coin. All that does is serve to confuse users of both.

Edit: and if you're going to make the argument about which side of the fork aligns with ""Satoshi's vision"", I think you need to stop letting some absent deity decide what Bitcoin is, and instead leave it to the actual users -- in fact, that's exactly how Satoshi intended for the whole thing to work! Otherwise it's not a decentralized system, it's a religion."
"3 was not relevant or representative or tangential to anything I wrote. You set up a straw man.

The wager is simple. You said BTC would lose its number 1 spot before the end of the year. I disagree. If I'm wrong I'll pay you $500 in whatever crypto you like, or cash, or dubloons or anything else. If you're wrong you pay me $500 in BTC.

However, there must be some stipulations. The determination would have to be fair. It might lose its #1 spot, though I doubt it, for a half second. If that's the sort of wager then I'd want odds, say 3:1 so I'd make $1,500 off a $500 bet. If you would agree it'd have to be dethroned for at least 6 months of the year then I'd give even odds for sure."
Yes there are people who don't even understand what segwit is begging for it because they have been told that it will miraculously solve every problem BTC has. Still segwit adoption is ridiculously low. Why I wonder if it's that great...

"If you want to give me $500 in ETH now, feel free. I'll accept free money any time you want. But your refusal is a clear indication you don't actually believe what you say. If you truly did you would have no problem making a wager. Amazing how people go from being sure about something to unsure when money is on the line, isn't it?

As for your straw man I don't address it. I said BTC is the only coin that can do it because it's the only trusted one. It's the only one with the value to do it. It doesn't matter if a man who would try to do it could skin an elephant with a pocket knife if there is no man who would attempt it."
How dense am I? Not at all, I think. I made a sound wager. Settle at the end of the year. I already told you I'm not interested in ETH I want BTC. There are many ways to perform the wager, strangely you'd only accept one you know I won't. Gee, wonder why? It's always such a mystery when someone won't put their money where their mouth is. Some would say that's a sign of a coward or someone who doesn't have the courage of their convictions, but, hey, you know, I don't believe such slander. Surely there is another reason why you wouldn't simply make a wager and honor it later.
">If you want to give me $500 in ETH now, feel free. I'll accept free money any time you want. But your refusal is a clear indication you don't actually believe what you say.

...how dense are you?

Alright , I will explain it slowly: to accept that wager I would want a multisig account with a trusted party, therefor I would basically lock up 500$ now to possibly win 500$, IF btc/eth flips. But, if it flips, and I would buy 500$ of ETH right now at current marketprice, I would also make about +500$. But if the flippening does not happen, then in case 1 I would lose 500$, whereas in case 2 I would still have the 500$. Assuming 50/50 odds, case 1 has an EV of 0, case 2 of about 250$. 

The problem is not that I do not think it will happen, the problem is that the market gives me a LOT better odds to make that bet.

Please tell me you understand this, if you are too stupid to understand basic principles (which I now explained multiple times) based of 5th grade math, then I am just completely wasting my time in talking to you.

And about the second point just a ""no comment"" from you ...how retarded, but further argument would only result in me wasting even more time."
"1. 3000 not 300.

2. If I said it then I said it.

3. Risk profile? Possible? No, I said what I said. Don't try to put words in my mouth.

4. Duh.

5. So?

No, obviously not. We make the wager for $500 and at years end we exchange the applicable amount in the crypto of the winner's choice."
It really isn't. This should be common knowledge for new investors to learn, hence why sites such as bitcoin.com are succintly explaining it. This is the reality of the situation.
"Also, to be clear, I'm not averse to a possible = trade of btc and eth, in fact that sounds fucking great, but that's not was I was considering.

If you want to sell me an equal amount of eth for btc I am 10,000% down."
They're both the original coin, just alternatives. That's how I see it.
I think bitcoin is pretty confusing to newcomers to begin with. It's a complicated subject, and both being alternatives where one will probably eventually win out doesn't add a significant amount of complexity imo.
"so do you agree or disagree with the ""strawman"", as you call it?

>The wager is simple. You said BTC would lose its number 1 spot before the end of the year. I disagree. If I'm wrong I'll pay you $500 in whatever crypto you like, or cash, or dubloons or anything else. If you're wrong you pay me $500 in BTC.

hahahah.

you cant be that stupid. my side of that bet is a lot worse than just buying 500$ of ETH now. 

...

"
">If you want to sell me an equal amount of eth for btc I am 10,000% down.

read again. trade at the end of the year, it is effectivly a future on ETH/BTC price. 

And I wrote 0.04...BTC vs 0.4... ETH, the exact nr according to current prices in $.

how would we set this up?
"
"So you do not disagree with nr.3?

>We make the wager for $500 and at years end we exchange the applicable amount in the crypto of the winner's choice. 

And what wager exactly have you proposed? This is not clear at all.

Also I would never do something like that without a multisig and a trusted third party."
"Bitcoin itself being confusing is orthogonal to forks being confusing. A lot of people invest in things they don't understand; when someone tells you you're investing in Apple when you're actually investing in Joe's Tech Co., they are defrauding you."
Don't you see how that could be incredibly confusing to newcomers? They want to buy the Bitcoin thing that everyone else is taking about, and in most cases that's BTC. They shouldn't need to understand forks in order to buy, and this can be avoided by using a different name for forks with minority consensus.
Which costs 10s of thousands of dollar as mentioned above. Double spends on small transactions are not really profitable.
"1.3000 what? 

2.if you say so

3.so the riskprofile of ETH/LTC/BCH/XLM is such that what you describe would not be possible? If you want to believe that, sure.

4.yes, adoption is very important this is true.

5.I have a bunch of money in ETH, some in a couple other things and no money in BTC.

>Say $500 in the crypto of your choice?

I send you what is currently worth 500$ in BTC(0.04...btc) and you send me what is currently worth 500$ in ETH(0.4...eth) at years end? 

How would we set that up?"
Misread. Not interested in that. 
If they pick omisego, it would be great for all the cryptos. The purpose of OMG is that you can pay with any currency, crypto or fiat, using their technology and the receiver will get any currency he prefers
Which would require all the miners or at least 51 percent to collude to not include the transaction. Which is a lot of work to do.

Best idea yet: figure out how to make espresso that does not taste like poop juice.
I could see it working as ERC20. Kind of like a gift card. 
Stripe was planning on using OmiseGO. Probably Starbucks will too. That way they can accept any crypto and any currency whatsoever
I bet his used both coins and can see which is usable. Simple as that.

"International commodities - for example 3000 tons of wheat - are being bought and sold with Bitcoin and not any other cryptocurrency. The reason merchant adoption matters is because a currency is only really worth what can be exchanged with it. Thanks to some forward thinking brokers, nations and commodities buyers that now means all the wheat in Russia as well as other high value items and commodities.

But you enjoy your shittiest coffee in the world."
"The real tether. ;)

Actually this could be a credible stablecoin in theory.. redeemable for coffees."

Less sound than BCH. Free lunch doesn't exist
"3000.

And I get my news from many sources. And, no, only Bitcoin can do what Bitcoin did because only Bitcoin is trusted as much. It's still first in usefulness because of its widest adoption stance. However you seem to be in disagreement so why don't we put some money on it? Say $500 in the crypto of your choice?"
Bean-backed
"I don’t give a shit what crypto the guy wants,more to the point is how anyone out there still thinks it’s cool to drink and be seen in Starbucks and the like.
Maybe 10 years ago,now it’s for fucking plebs so don’t drink or frequent there crap coffee house and you’ll get some street cred back."
">International commodities are being bought and sold with Bitcoin

might want to include sources. Adoption? Sure, but one deal does not mean much.

Anyways, now nation-states can use bitcoin for 3000 ton wheat deals. Good for them, but not why bitcoin is interesting or why I like the bitcoin-project.

Also ""0 tons of wheat sold with any blockchain other than Bitcoin."", come on, you do understand why this is a joke, right?

[This website](https://ideas.starbucks.com/) is where you can share your ideas with Starbucks.
Agreed. BCH was the one that forked off. Not the other way around. I’m not saying BTC is superior in any way, but to just deny facts is a step too far and makes the BCH community seem kind of “radical”. I mean, you can have different opinions and all but just blatant disregard for the events that have taken place in the crypto space is not a good look for any community.

> Also ""0 tons of wheat sold with any blockchain other than Bitcoin."", come on, you do understand why this is a joke, right?

Nope, not a joke. This is how currencies become currencies. Bitcoin is forging ahead, all others are falling behind except Ethereum which is finding novel use cases in Canadian executive and legislative processes. First it was used for weed and smuggling and all that. Then fraud. Then pizza. Now nations take notice. You think this is the first or only deal done in Bitcoin like this? You understand the significance of it being used as a legitimate currency to circumvent global banking for huge deals? You maybe understand ... you can see it now... yes quite clearly that now Bitcoin's blockchain value just surged by the value of the entire wheat trade between Russia and Turkey because now Turkey can buy wheat Russian wheat with Bitcoin... yeeees, noooow you understand.

Think about it. A currency is worth the market it operates in. The CAD is worth about 80 cents. Fine. Vendors in the USA don't accept it. If people in the USA simply refused to exchange it for USD then in the USA the value of CAD would be nil because you couldn't by anything with it. The price would plummet because it would only be valuable to cross border traders.

Think about ice. In New Orleans after Katrina a bucket of ice was nearly priceless. Same bucket of ice couldn't by you a stale rat fart in Alaska. Get it? What makes Bitcoin interesting to you is of absolutely no concern to anyone but yourself. Fact: Bitcoin is growing in value and use."

That is one single usecase(and one of the least interesting ones) of tens to hundreds for ETH. You seem to get your opinions from clicking on a few links on reddit ""oh BTC used for 300t wheat deal"" ""oh, canada is doing some things with ETH"".

You do understand every cryptocurrency can do what bitcoin did there, right?

These are the kind of stupid posts that reflect more on /r/BTC than Bitcoin. Keep them coming. Appreciate the transparency.

Random anti white comments are generally more racist than the white people you are generalizing 
Um, almost everyone I interact with on a day to day basis is completely appalled by Blockstream, the state of Bitcoin, and the behavior of the Core crowd in general. BCH is way more popular outside of the internet, because you can't sockpuppet real life.
You don't have to go to any meetings. The evidence is all around you. Retailers are dropping their acceptance of BTC in droves because of the ridiculous transaction fees that core refuses to do anything about.
you're delusional
You get downvoted for calling it bcash sir.
Define “soon”.
The flip side being you're about to lose alot of money. 
Do you think LN will have the same massive successful and rapid adoption than SW? LN still doesn't have trustless decentralized routing. It's a centralized shitcoin that is currently being rolled out. Congrats on that! 
\*beep boop\*
That's the dumbest thing anyone has ever uttered on this subreddit 
"BCH a hard fork from BTC 

Uses a larger memory block than BTC following BTCs original growth plan. It's arguably what BTC should be but not all the miners followed the fork so we have BCH and BTC and BCH is valued ~1/8th of what BTC is. "
You are not being neutral then, but a shill.
The irony, you shit talking r/btc complaining they shit talk you.
No they usually just laugh at the Chinese controlled shitcoin
I almost did a spit take. 
No-those are 1meg wheels. He's holding a segstick.
Haha!
You don't get banned here for shitpost or shit comments, only downvoted. But your comment shows how you've been programmed in the other sub to not write the wrong things. About a censorship-resistant coin...
Nah it’s just /r/bitcoin that hands out the bans left and right.
Don't you see the confusion where the whole world is on one page and this subreddit with the name /r/btc has its own strange set of beliefs? 
"""Us early adopters""?  How about you keep your delusions to yourself.  Some of us '""early adopters"" didn't ""buy"" into anything, just mined fake unusable digital money.  Things change.  Adoption changes the nature of every development.  Either you move on or cling to the past.  Like the ""make America great"" against bullshit.  Great when?  And for whom?  Africans?  Native Americans?  Or just spoiled white boys?"
You're living in bizzaro world alright. I suggest going to any neutral bitcoin meetup anywhere in the world not organized by Ver or something and see how many people agree with you.
Usually I just get downvoted because bcash supporters aren't informed enough to respond but look at this detailed rebuttal! BCH supporter? You're on the wrong sub. Bitcoin supporter? This isn't a bitcoin subreddit anymore. This has become a troll bitcoin subreddit, which makes the OP all the more ironic. You don't see this sort of sad attack on r/ethereum... I wonder why?
Why not take bch and bitcoincash (long but its not a dreaded nickname) and leave r/btc and r/bitcoin to bitcoin? Isn't that obviously the fair solution or do you just not care?
Here's the history: A minority wanted to go in a different direction with bitcoin. They created bch, a fork and now they don't have to argue any more than can just do their own thing. Rather than do that they attack btc. 
seriously, you aren't even a millionaire

"I agree with you. I frequent both subs.  The people here raise good points about the scaling problems and the shitshow that is the lightning network. But I don’t particularly care for BCH either. There are tons of cryptos that have fast and cheap transaction times and tons that can do more than just send money. I hardly ever see the Bitcoin subreddit give 2 shits about BCH. This sub and this community is definitely  more militant towards “the other bitcoin”. 

I follow this sub mostly because they are very good at criticizing BTC. While the BCH community is sometimes a little petty or biased (like any community can be at times), more often they bring up real issues with the BTC network and team. If nothing less it’s just best to try and get multiple perspectives and opinions with these things.

TLDR; you’re right.  This sub bitches a lot more but they express real concerns over the BTC network. And if you ask me, that’s a good thing. "
"Wtf are you talking about?? Did you not see the countless Bcash memes on rbitcoin. You're literally only choosing to see what fits your narrative and ignoring all other facts. I'm done talking to you.

They get downvoted by many real people. Not banned by ONE stupid mod. There's a difference. One is a democracy, the other is tyranny."
I think it says a lot that the level of bitterness is so high that any meme taking a shot at bitcoin with the bitcoin symbol would be the top ranked post. Its my opinion that the people here aren't as knowledgeable and it seems like anything pro bitcoin or open to the lightning network gets downvoted now.
Bitcoin is definitely more popular on and off the internet... pretty much any graph will show you this. No need to live in la la land
"It's one stupid meme. Look at the other posts debunking LN and other Core ""features"" those are usually more intelligent and interesting. There are commenters on both sides of the debate here, but on rbitcoin there's pro-LN and there's banned. ""Most of the posters aren't as knowledgeable"" right. Very compelling argument. Not at all an ad hominem remark."
"> While this is a valid argument, I am not sure why it has been so easily accepted as truth.  
  
I'm not accepting it as truth, but I do give it serious consideration because it logically seems to be the most likely outcome.  
  
> The only real life scenario similar to LN is the proliferation of the world wide web  
  
This is an interesting point, but one may counter with the fact that a very large amount of websites are now hosted on cloud services. True, there are many people and companies that run and host their own websites, but very very VERY large cloud providers host the rest.  I believe Reddit is hosted by Amazon?"
"> The interesting is part is that the lightning network is layer 1 agnostic.  

This is interesting and I think that LN may have good applications elsewhere. Ironically, it may be suitable for something like BCH in the future. As a BCH supporter does that make me a hypocrite? Maybe, maybe not. As I said before, I think LN is a cool idea. If you look at some of my other posts I've given it credit as being a micropayment system that does make sense. I don't think it's the silver bullet, so to say, and therefore I don't think it will solve BTC's issue of capacity expansion.  
  
>  Centralisation FUD is a misnomer because it is a dynamic network with very low entry costs to become an economic participan ANDt multi hubs does not make for centralisation.  
  
This is not FUD, this is just a discussion on the merits of a technical solution.  We are early adopters and we should be discussing how to make the system better as a whole for the benefit of all users.  It is healthy to have discussions, and it is normal for people to have differing opinions.  BTC and BCH both have solutions and no one knows which one, if either, will be adopted.  
  
For the issue of centralization I can only think of bitcoin usage as myself and others I know would use it.  I do not see myself, as a bitcoin user, opening and maintaining various channels to various entities.  If I own 10BTC, and my options are:

1. Open 10 channels, each of which I may commit 1BTC to, or
1. Open 1 channel, and commit 10BTC

As a user option #2 seems much more attractive to me.  It is less complex, I must only maintain one channel.  It is cheaper, I must only pay L1 fees to open and close one channel.  It is more convenient, I have the full 10BTC to commit to transactions.  
  
It is true there are users who will want to use LN as intended, opening many channels and distributing their transactions around the network.  I feel like it is also true that most users, being they want to get the most 'bang for their buck', will simply use one channel, and that channel will likely end up being with a hub that can fund it and that has many connections to other hubs - in other words, a centralized and consolidated service.  
  
Time will tell, but we should not be surprised to see this.  
  
> Simply beating the old ""we are the original bitcoin and thus should be called bitcoin"" is tiresome.  
  
This is not relevant to my post at all.  
  
> Bch would be better off fixing malleability and having users develop lightning themselves, removing the ASICBOOST advantage that the central mining cartel currently solely enjoys, thereby inviting more miners.  
  
I don't necessarily disagree with these points, but they are slightly off topic."
I am worried... about your mental health. btc and bch had an even start at the fork. Which one is worth more?
I know the history. I used to like this subreddit more because it was uncensored, even if most of the posters aren't as knowledgeable. That's why it's sad to see this OP and what this subreddit has turned into.
Don't start this game, as we could be here a while. 
"> but if we project out the likely path that it will take it DOES seem to suggest that a large portion of the LN nodes will consolidate to operators who draw in users to open massive amounts of channels, and who own an control a large amount of BTC to fund uplink channels. 

While this is a valid argument, I am not sure why it has been so easily accepted as truth. There is no proof whatsoever, and at this stage it is all conjecture. There are also a number of arguments against this happening, the most valid of which may be that the users of LN may want to ensure that it doesn't become what r/btc say it will become. That is quite powerful motivation. 

The only real life scenario similar to LN is the proliferation of the world wide web. If you were to look at the graph of the www, you would see that it is pretty decentralised, and this was an emergent graph without economic incentives (at least not as obvious as those in the LN). 

If the incentives are matched to motivations of users, you might be surprised to see what type of graph emerges. Not to mention that the free market will actually decide the shape and magnitude of the graph (as apposed to any external influence - which is what this sub thinks). "
"The interesting is part is that the lightning network is layer 1 agnostic.  Of course it is being used on btc first because it is the most distributed and developed/secure chain by far, but it can be used elsewhere as well.
Centralisation FUD is a misnomer because it is a dynamic network with very low entry costs to become an economic participan ANDt multi hubs does not make for centralisation.  If one hub goes down (or several) routes can be found.
It's a waste of time arguing about it's viability when the growth of the test beds are growing so rapidly.
Bch would be better off fixing malleability and having users develop lightning themselves, removing the ASICBOOST advantage that the central mining cartel currently solely enjoys, thereby inviting more miners.
Simply beating the old ""we are the original bitcoin and thus should be called bitcoin"" is tiresome."

"Yah the price of BCH is only higher than BTC was a year ago, and it's gotten me more gains than if I had held BTC.

You're trying so hard to convince me the emperor is wearing clothes... got something concerning you? Sure seems like you're worried :)"
Learn the history of why r/BTC exists before you run your mouth.
The market is currently valuing vaporware king Cardano at $17billion. 
"LN allows for casino chips to be traded cheaply and easily between one another. So what? The real problem is when everyone cashes out. The ""bank run"" is still a problem."
It's definitely failing in term of usage and you can't argue that. So do you think the same will happen with LN for more or less the same reasons?
"I get what you're saying and you're completely right. LN could work, and it could be huge, and that could leave BCH in a bad spot - if you're comparing the utility of BTC to BCH. However, if you would be willing to entertain an alternative view then you're probably not like most of the other people I've seen in /r/bitcoin (and many people here too). I feel like LN is a great idea, but if we project out the likely path that it will take it DOES seem to suggest that a large portion of the LN nodes will consolidate to operators who can draw in users, open massive amounts of channels, and who own an control a large amount of BTC to fund uplink channels. The long term road map for LN is absolutely no doubt lead to centralization. Users will want to open the least amount of channels possible, because you must pay L1 fees to open but also because you must lock BTC in the channel during the lifetime of it. It makes sense for users to open only one channel to a well connected and funded hub. So while yes, LN is a cool idea, and yes LN may work, LN seems likely to position BTC to abandon its original intentions of being a decentralized and free system. These original ideas are really what BCH is trying to maintain.  
  
I invite you to take a moment to consider how bitcoin was founded and the mentality of the users for the first few years, then compare and contrast the feelings of the users today. If you can set aside bias and anger, I feel like many people who really believed in the early bitcoin would believe in bitcoin cash today."
If we seem bitter you should realize most of us are early adopters who helped build Bitcoin, r/Bitcoin and BCT up to the popularity they have today before getting banned from those sites for trying to promote big blocks that will help miners make the transition to fee based income vs block rewards, a needed event outlined in the WP that ensures all BTC/BCH value long term. We also see that btc has been usurped by a bunch of clueless core devs who have tried to capitalize on Bitcoin's success by crippling the mainchain so they can steal fees from miners by marketing their proprietary offchain solutions. They have stolen the good Bitcoin name and years of hard work that should have put us in a price range much higher than where at are today. Bunch of bastards if you ask me. 
And now we need the Bitcoin Cash bus speed past.
"Everyone just do that for yourself. Take a poll: ask 10 strangers in a in any real life neutral cryptocurrency meetup: a) are you ""appalled by blockstream"" b) is btc bitcoin. You know what can't be gamed by sockpuppets? The price. Not even with some huge idiosyncratic holders claiming they bought heavily into bch the price is really low and so is the use. How can that be sock puppets? You're obviously in the minority here."
BTC = Bitcoin is delusional?
The market is currently favoring bitcoin 6:1 over bitcoin cash. 😀
You can argue it’s failing as the node count and value being transacted on the network grow exponentially. But If the lighting network works, y’all are fucked. That’s why the front page of /r/BTC is all lightning FUD. You guys have everything riding on the lightning network not working. Think about that. 
Explain why, please. 
No. You seem to be describing Bitcoin Cash (BCH). bcash is a term made up by a group called dragons den, to drop the word bitcoin. It is also some sort of thing in South America and will be a new totally different cryptocurrency on its own.
"How do you figure?  I don't shill anything.  I'm merely pointing out a truth.  I don't care who wins out of BTC/BCH because I won't touch either.  
 
If you want my honest opinion, though, I think that the anti-BCH sentiment comes from people who are so deeply invested with money they can't lose into BTC that their reptile brains take over and foam at the mouth defending BTC (case in point, you attacking me for no reason).  I think the entire Bitcoin ecosystem is fucked right now and I'm just going to avoid both until a winner emerges or a savings/chequeing account system between the two arises."
You're stuck in a censored forum where they don't have to bitch since all pro BCH discussion gets censored. 
Corecoin isn't bitcoin.
Dude I don’t know what I can do to make you believe me, but I really never have. They don’t care...
Wrong post :) [This](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7tj0ll) one maybe?
Nah, it's a bitcoin sub, Core/ cash, whatever you prefer. Just don't expect to get banned anytime soon, you might be disappointed.
Wow thank you! My first ETH !

This isn’t exactly the sentiment over at /r/bitcoin. Lighthnig network is rolling out and bitcoin will soon be orders of magnatude cheaper to use than BCH. Either lightning fails or you guys are about to lose a lot money. 
"""bitcoin isn't for buying coffees, but we're going to be angry and boycott you anyway, because....reasons..."""
You think you are somebody? I HAVE money. So much money, way more money than you or your youtube followers
Its not even relevant to a specific thing with bitcoin or bitcoin cash right now? Bitcoin is doing great...? Bcash and bitcoin are pretty much becoming two completely separate things. 
#hodl
this time is different.
not this one
"Can u make one for the tether fud terds?

"
I'm not sure, but does BCH already have colored coins like the ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum block chain? If so, I'd argue that Ethereum still has a first-mover advantage and widespread adoption with hundreds of different tokens issued based on the Ethereum block chain. Nothing that could not change, but still a long way to go. 
We need a bot that corrects etherium 
"So all you fanbois in the ""BTC"" sub that adore Bcash. Why dont you like or advocate Litecoin? Better, been around longer... what gives?"
Isn't this a subreddit for bitcoin discussions? Why is bcash talked so much now in here it's practically all I ever see anymore 
thats cause they keep calling it bcash
This sub is so ironic hahaha. I have genuinely never heard a fan of core complain about bcash. The normally don’t even know or care about its existence. But bcash supporters on the other hand. This community bitches and moans and blames core CONSTANTLY. Like it never fucking ends and then everyone just wakes up the next day and starts the process all over again.
"Should label the stick ""block limit"" or something."
The top post on an alleged bitcoin subreddit is mocking bitcoin. How does that make sense?
You know what I consider trolling? Taking over the BTC subreddit and promoting bch? What if BCH was controlled by bitcoin supporters? Nobody is searching for BCH by going to BTC. This subreddit should be abandoned by people who don't support bitcoin and left as an uncensored bitcoin subreddit. It shouldn't be a BCH subreddit because the name is btc.
"This is a shitpost general thread I guess so I wanted to ask:


In the event of OPcodes being enabled, what will ETH be able to do that BCH won't? Also, I think it'd be nice if we had a stickied thread dedicated to noise questions and discussion like this.."
This feels like i am in a bch subreddit. Am I?

They are bloody obsessed with him for some reasons.."

You should not display your ignorance but inform yourself why this sub isn't called bch

Yeah, man, thanks for your words.
"I literally left the r/bitcoin sub because of all the complaining and hatred towards Roger Ver and Bitcoin Cash. Along with the fact that every time I tried to post anything I was SILENTLY censored! Which you'll notice hasn't  happened here to you?! You're talking absolute bollocks. Everyone here came from that sub because they're fed up with the censored shit there and the constant bashing of 'Bcash'! 
I'm not condoning some of the utter shit posts on here but at least you can have an argument and not be banned. I'm so sick of this divide and Bitcoin being completely wrecked, it's all gone to crap. "
What's bcash?
"I am completely neutral in this fight, but I'm subbed to both /r/bitcoin and /r/btc.
 
What you just said is just completely untrue.  /r/Bitcoin is nothing but people talking shit about BCH and then banning people they don't like.  Constantly - in every thread that BCH comes up in."
"> I have genuinely never heard a fan of core complain about bcash. 

stop lying"
Well BCH is Bitcoin.. in fact it is much closer to the original experiment than BTC.

"If you look closely enough you will see no mention of bitcoin in the cartoon. The attack is on the symbol most closely associated with BTC.

How it works is most bitcoin supporters here obviously do not consider BTC to be Bitcoin any more."
"Because Bitcoin (BTC) is no longer Bitcoin as us early adopters bought into. It is not a ""peer-to-peer electronic cash network"", which is what the whitepaper says it is supposed to be.

So yes, it looks strange, but that's because we're currently living in bizzarro world where up is down, black is white, and BTC isn't Bitcoin."

Bcash groundhog day
I’ve repeatedly suggested exchanging r/btc for r/bitcoin.  Make that happen and then we can fix this.

boohoo
What makes Litecoin objectively better? I'm curious.
