Or maybe r / bitcoin could simply end their Nazi-level censorship, and stop banning people who talk about Bitcoin BTC's high fees.

As a Chinese, I am so jealous of these people what they can do.
They can always tax real property.  Pretty hard to up and move your land and home.  A government agent can always show up at your door and demand that you pay your tax or boot you out.  Same with a car.  I predict that most income tax and capital gains taxes will eventually die out, and will be replaced by higher property taxes and car registration taxes.
"WOW thanks!   I would say that limiting yourself to bitcoin is limiting yourself to money.   I don't see bitcoin doing anything exciting in the blockchain space, even with thinks like RSK.   I think bitcoin and bitcoin cash will always be ""money"" (bitcoin less so if it doesn't get it's shit together regarding unconfirmed transactions).   I think other things out there though are really funding companies, some are shams, some only want to get rich themselves, but there are some in there that want to change the world."

"This is what communism is, to control and centrally plan everything. The bitcoin ban is a cabal proof of how controlling they are, actually, they are banning the biggest crypto industry in the world instead of adapting. They forbid some people to leave the country, wtf.

Once someone told me that China would never really ban anything because the chinese felt they lost the internet boom to the americans, and now they wanted to be upfront in crypto and fintech in general. They killed 90% of the industry so far. Japan is very thankful, they are opening to all of this."

They use smartphone payments more than americans use credit cards and their market is 1.3 bil. Crypto is still new so they are adopting a wait and study approach.

The Chinese would be a dominant market in crypto once they secure and launch it under their own umbrella through state banks and national institutions.

There are even talks of a digital crypto currency with secure serials to track every transaction that happens in the entire economy that's in the works. And digital cashless cities built on neo smart contracts.

And here you are shitting them on innovation just because ideologically you can't accept an socialist system as anything but a failure, when they are the number 2 economy in the world and the number 1 population in the world,  and the longest continuous human civilization and culture in existence, with a system that has lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty in as short as 40 years."

"China right now is at an imitation stage. They don't do anything particularly better than the west yet but they are catching up. They don't like to take the first step instead preferring to let the west take the lead and experiment with new tech before using it themselves. 

They are also not a democracy nor really a fully free market. Their sense of control and regulation is drastically different, which as a young system of the world's largest nation is warranted.  Imagine if they just say alright cryptos all right and legal, and 1billion Chinese suddenly all get hyped and start buying and using bitcoins instead of RMB. That would be a disaster for China. And a disaster for China will have repercussions for the region and the world.

But all that said. The Chinese have proven to be anything but dumb and inept.

 Neither have they been shown to be aggressive and warlike. Both of which the US shows plenty , particularly with Trump. "

"money is short term/small thinking.   there's a bigger thing here.   Think about this -- the end of any censorship in every country on the planet.  

Think about this -- what happens when crypto gets so big, no one every cashes back out into fiat currency?   The government loses ALL control because of how the technology works.  They litterally can't ever get your ""money"".

Governments are terrified of crypto because of what it does right now yes, but what it brings to the table in the future.   

And here's the cool part - all the crypto that they want to get rid of, and control? -- it's all the new form of ""stock"" backing the new wave of tech companies dedicated to doing things like decentrailzed information sharing.

If the governments can't stop these companies money supply, then what these companies produce will grow like an unstoppable virus.

Imagine making it impossible for censorship in China or Iran to exist?  Imagine a system that can track exact origins of stories and ensure that they never ever can be manipulated.   What about photos being backed by cryptographic work so they can't be altered?

These things are the real power, and they're all on the horizon and very real."

"I guess I don't understand. Why should the minister be fired for manipulating a decentralized currency? If it was their currency that is understandable, but one of the huge points of currency is the fact that it isn't accountable to or controlled by governments.

"Korean history, since it’s inception, is riddled by incompetent leaders who fail to look after their people.

And that spirit is still live and well within us. "
"Yes. This is significant. S. Korea has a population of 51.25 million people. That's 0.2% of their population.

Because they can manipulate heavily the price with these announcements, and could be using people to buy and sell for them.
It was very real, it's just that the department actually in charge of such things didn't initiate it and disagree's with it.
They retracted it, correct. I'm just sharing this fact, that people signed this petition.
I don't doubt, because south korea is a major player in the whole crypto industry, there are hundreds of thousands of people, if not millions, trading. Bithumb alone frequently overtakes all the volume of all western fiat-based exchanges, and it is not even the biggest exchange in SK anymore.
"Korea has a *very* strict policy when it comes to creating an online account and verifying your ID. There are multiple steps of verification that involves Korean version of SS number (but you know, actually a secured and better functioning one that was meant to do just that). You have to type in that number, get a 2-step verification process such as having a code sent to your phone number, but iirc the phone number has to registered under the same name.

I don’t know if the online petition requires you to create a full account, but if it does, it is a looooot more secure and trustworthy.

Of course there is no such thing as a fail-proof system, but at least we will probably not have a shitshow that happened with the FCC or anything equivalent. "

"The ripple foundation 100% controls *issuance* of the currency.  Without the corporation, coins couldn't even be generated.  There is no mining process and there is no incentive to protect or secure the network.  

The white paper shows the reality of their consensus algorithm in this paragraph...

>While we have shown that the Ripple Protocol is
provably secure so long as the bounds described in equations 1 and 3 are met, it is worth noting that these are
maximal bounds, and in practice the network may be
secure under significantly less stringent conditions.  It
is also important to recognize, however, that satisfying
these bounds is not inherent to the RPCA itself,  but
rather requires **management of the UNLs of all users.**
The default UNL provided to all users is already sufficient, but should a user make changes to the UNL, it
must be done with knowledge of the above bounds. In
addition, **some monitoring of the global network structure  is required**  in  order  to ensure  that  the bound  in
equation 3 is met, and that agreement will always be
satisfied.

Notice the part where it talks about *management of the UNLs of all users* and the part where it talks about *some monitoring of global network structure* being required...

The white paper goes in depth into the likelihood of a false consensus being achieved and shows that ripple can provably function while less than 20% of the network are bad actors.  

But 20% bad actors is nothing.  It means literally nothing when there is no incentive from mining or fees or anything else to not be a bad actor.  Since there is no proof of work or proof of stake or anything else involved, a group of bad actors who have no investment in the network what so ever could spin up a bunch of nodes for essentially no cost and corrupt the network.  

And guess who saves the network at this point... the *management.*

If Ripple labs went away, the coin would instantly die.  "

Crazy. If that's how it legally works, it does seem easier and better to have separate accounts and, worst case, make a secondary card for the person you want to give spending access to. At least everything is much clearer.

"Your use of the word ""distributed"" in reference to Ripple is bullshit and is meant only to mislead people who don't understand why distribution of a ledger must happen in bitcoin and other real crypto currencies.  The purpose of distribution of a ledger in a real cryto is to secure that ledger by making it impossible to change other than through consensus.  Every time we add a block to a chain, it demands that consensus because it essentially forks the previous chain in a way that is provably following consensus rules. 

Unlike any real crypto currency, for ripple, the fact that people *can* (nobody actually does) have copies (""distributed"") of the ledger does nothing to prevent ripple from changing the ledger and has no relationship to consensus. 

Ripple's ledger is mutable only by and through Ripple, and the fact that people can have a copy has no impact on its security or the fact that it is entirely censorable and controllable 100% by Ripple.  Ripple claims that it is peer to peer, but it holds the final word on everything that enters or exits their chain, so they are full of shit, just like the use of ""distributed"" is technically true but entirely misleading concerning ripple... full of shit, just like the Ripple coin is full of shit in general."
Not where I live. I am in Texas. Come down for a rattlesnake roundup
Right, exactly. Like if I loan someone a key to my house to feed my cat while I'm on vacation, they can't just take my TV. Access and ownership can definitely be different things.
A real Ledger also isn't pre-initialized. If you have a pre-initialized Ledger and you wonder what to do if you lose it, you'll realize something doesn't make sense. But with the additional scratch card, it makes sense again.
Why would he print and send to the victim an actual recovery sheet for the preinstalled address?  
Yeah. There have always been people with more money than sense but to me it seems like these scams could become a keynote in why politicians and banks will try and push for regulations. Always a few bad apples
You base that assertion on what definition?

I hadn't thought about it before, but it makes sense now that you frame it objectively. Seems analogous to having a roommate. Just because we share a roof doesn't mean you can take my stuff. 
"The point is where do you draw the line. It ends up being either ridiculously strict and pointless (as in you have to account exactly for how much you put in and how much you take out) or some judge will subjectively draw a line somewhere.

I don't like this kind of things. "
"> I don't disagree, but how the fuck is verifying wallet signatures relevant to this particular scam?

I'm not talking about wallet signatures, but generating seeds, keys and wallets with trusted software. Even if you download from github it's a good habit to verify that the binary was signed by the author.

This scam would have been avoided if he had a habit of not trusting pre-generated seeds and keys, **especially** for something he got from eBay.

He didn't know how seeds work, so he made a costly mistake. This is the biggest problem with crypto money, it's easy to make mistakes even for people who try to do things right."
But why include it in the first place?   We're talking in circles.  The thief had to go way out of their way to create that sheet, put the silver scratch off stuff on there, stick it in the package... For what reason?  The ONLY reason that I can think of is to trick people into using that compromised recovery phrase.
The fuck are you talking about? Ripple doesn't own all the validators anymore, they can't just freeze your XRP or seize it. If the Ripple company went away tomorrow then XRP would still function. So I don't see how what you said is true at all. Do you have sources? 
Curious what you use eBay for.  I lost a bid on a Hyundai Tiburon in 2009, never looked back.
"> The thief's intent was to steal, but did he actually commit a crime other than deceiving OP. 

Deception is fraud, which is a crime. So, providing an item that you say is brand new, but which you've already configured, and then provided a different set of instructions so that it would appear that you hadn't already set it up, that's quite a bit of intent. IT's not like it was a simple email even, IIRC, they had scratch off cards made professionally...

 There are probably a litany of other crimes as well, interstate commerce, using a computer in commission of a crime (again, fraud, theft, etc), wire fraud. Someone else mentioned mail fraud, which makes sense since it was probably delivered by the USPS. And Postal Inspectors don't take kindly to people doing that sort of stuff.

I'm not even a lawyer. 

Saying ""It might be fraud but maybe not because its cryptocurrency"" is not a valid argument. Maybe you think the laws haven't caught up, but even if you claim ""hey, i didn't steal the coins, see, they'ere still right on the block chain"" you've deprived someone else of them.

So yeah, if the scammer registered their eBay account under their real name (or one that could be attached to them) and/or accepted payment with a method that was tied to them (paypal), then they're correct to scramble to make things right...

Oh, and I believe Trezor's CEO inquired here about the listing too... So on top of OP (who might have originally appeared too small to be a threat), eBay, Paypal and the postal service (who, the scammer might have thought wouldn't take much interest in such a ""small"" scam), there's also a business whose livelihood depends on people trusting their products implicitly. 

Really bad idea. From so many angles. Maybe in 2012 before Bitcoin was understood by hardly anyone, but even in that case, the government caught up with some of the people who misbehaved (from the governments perspective) with Bitcoin (from their perspective) with Bitcoin..."

I did not even know they address/seed in the first place as it was already preinstalled on the Ledger. Only the thief who put it on there knows.

He clone my Ledger, he already know the seed on my Ledger as he preinstalled it, so all he had to do is put the seed in again on his own Ledger and then he had full control of my wallets.
"He is a image to help you - https://imgur.com/V1WVO4B
If you received a Ledger with documents the same as the ones at the bottom of the picture, do not use it send it back. It should not come with a already filled Recovery sheet. Unfortunately I did not know that at the time."
Thanks so much.
Thanks
Thanks
He has the private key as he know what wallet address to send the coins back to.
he could choose not to press charges though. And plus him paying it back might help him strike a SLIGHTLY better deal. there's no point in keeping it, so you might as well try
Because I am reaching out to the thief.
But the recovery words do not work, they are a different seed. I have try 3 times.
How do I do that? I have had a look on the internet but cannot find anything about it.
"> Theoretically he didn't steal the coins

He totally did steal the coins - he moved them from an address OP controlled (together with the thief) to his own. Since no *physical* good was stolen it would probably be some sort of fraud charges instead of regular theft charges, but definitely illegal.

Imagine if someone forged a letter from your bank, claiming that your new bank account number is X, and you updated your salary payments to go to this attacker-controlled account. Do you really think that wouldn't be considered a crime?"

I have heard that some of the cryptolocker software has better end-of-life support than commercial software. Releasing the keys is common.
Genius  idea u/tippr 500 bits 
It is not classified as stolen if he returned it to the addresses you had access on, this would much more mean that you lost it, because you lost thw access to those addresses you originally had!
good luck, and that thief will get his own karma.
I'd remove that jail threat it if I was you. It's meaningless and would only make the thief resentful that you're threatening him while he's trying to return the money 
Wooow Bitcoin robin hood  
Man, what a terrible scam. Hope OP gets their money back and the scammer realized what he did was wrong. Use your mind to make money the honest way and invest in crypto like the rest of us!

You should not have reset that device. It contained evidence. Also access to the refunded coins is gone because you reset.
"I think the thief decided to give the money back because he probably read the White Paper and realized XRP was created by JpMorgan to take peer to peer payments away from you and me...and regulate the shit out of it.

"I lost the link and I'm forever sad. But I saw this one YouTube video over the summer that basically broke down a cryptocurrency into five primitives. 

The primitives were, as I recall,

A hashing algorithm

A consensus algorithm

A blockchain

Something

Something else. 

It was really intuitive and well-explained. I just can't remember who did the video or what coin they were reviewing. "
nop, I was hoping it was. 
"> It just has a central authority keeping track of how much XRP everyone has

Not true, it relies on a distributed ledger system. "
On what basis must a cryptocurrency have a blockchain? 
if I recall correctly - OP was advised (by ledger) to reset it and get a new seed. So it's not the same wallet as the seed that it was shipped wiith. Without the seed words it was originally shipped with, OP can't access that wallet again - even if he has the [old] PIN. 
Maybe OP sent the thief more harshly worded messages on eBay and his tone here is softer now that he sees the thief is making an effort to return the funds?

"> a pretty sophisticated scam if it's real. It's a quasi-professional operation

You're kidding, right? A pre initialized crypto device from eBay. All kind of alarms need go off when you see that. It breaks the first rule of crypto: if you down own the private key, it's not your money. You NEVER use predefined seeds, or seeds from websites, mails, etc. If someone generated they key for you, you already can't trust it. It's the first rule.

You also need to know how to verify the hashes and signature of wallet software. Unfortunately a lot of stuff on github completely lacks signatures, verifying ownership is impossible. People in this sub downvote this stuff, but parent poster is right, crypto is not for everyone. Some basic crypto knowledge is needed to use crypto money, the learning curve is pretty steep."
Ledgers do not come with a presinstalled seed, but I did not know that at the time of setting it up, and I received one with a preinstalled seed.
"Not at all. My point was that this scam has a start up cost associated with it. Maybe a significant one. You are saying this with retrospect. Here is how I know. 

He didn't buy it knowing that it was pre-initialized. 

He was trying to follow the first rule of crypto (which I agree with). 

How do you own your own private keys? Well, one way that everyone recommends is a Ledger. 

So he bought one *new* from ebay. It came *sealed* with printed paper cards in the exact same font as the original. He followed the instructions that came in the *sealed package*. 

I don't disagree, but how the fuck is verifying wallet signatures relevant to this particular scam? It's a real Ledger. Please gloat more about your mastery of the security curve, good sir.

He was the first (and only?) person to report falling for this particular scam. It was unknown prior. This wasn't a myetherwllet.com or send me your private keys scam.

Finally, I agree that crypto isn't for everyone. However, this isn't a situation where someone decided not to use 2FA. He tried to follow the first rule of crypto, the most secure way (hardware wallet), and was the first person to get caught by a scam with a significant start up cost. 

Obviously his opsec could have been better. Is yours impregnable? I doubt it. He was trying to do the right thing for the first time. Show some empathy."
Thank you for using your bad situation to help the community learn from your negative experience. Taking time to answer small questions like mine and others. Your reaction has been calm and tactful. I truly wish you the best and hope you are made whole either now or in the future as a karma in some way.
"When you received your Ledger Nano, it prompted you to set up your password, right?  Usually it is a series of digits (maybe 4 to 8 digits).  Did you set up your password?  I assume so because in your post last week you indicated you actually used this Ledger for a while and then left it alone for a month before realising the theif stole your funds.  But in order for you to use it, you would really have needed to have a password. 

Anyway, once you set up your Ledger, you should really only need to have the device inserted in your computer and know your password to be able to send funds.  It should require you to enter your password to even open it up and see your wallets.  Since you said you saw the funds back in your ledger wallets, I assumed you had your password.  If so, you can just set up new wallets somewhere else (anywhere else) outside the control of the scammer.  Then send the funds from your compromised Ledger Nano to the new wallets you created somewhere else. "
He said ledger was sold out. I wouldn't discourage anyone from using crypto. If you want these currencies mass adopted that includes the suckers and less tech savvy also.  
because it doesnt even have a blockchain. It just has a central authority keeping track of how much XRP everyone has
Well...to be pedantic because the currency is called XRP not Ripple.

Taxation is theft. Why would I ran such a thing?
Agreed. But it's still an obstacle needed to be crossed at one point to be more widely adopted. Wallets for people who want to follow the law and write transactions as purchases for their returns at the end of the year

Hey guys. I’m curious. If there were more asic miners, mining Bitcoin to the point where fees were cheap and instant. Wouldn’t there be a lot more interest and mass adoption? 
All of the above allows open blockchains which will be resilient to each threat to evolve faster. Anti-fragility
Do you have a blockchain or wallet that tells you your capital gains tax on every purchase? 
"> 8MB is not nearly enough to compete with Visa. It would have to be at least 100 times bigger than that.

That's correct.  But we don't need to handle Visa-level traffic *today*.  It's going to be a gradual climb.  Storage and bandwidth will get cheaper in the meantime.  And if on-chain scaling starts to get unwieldy, we always have the option of deploying layer 2 solutions.

Did you notice that word ""option""?  Layer 2 isn't *mandatory* with Bitcoin Cash.  There's still more than enough room on layer 1.  And as storage costs drop and bandwidth becomes more available, layer 1 can be expanded farther without sacrificing decentralization.  That's in contrast to another coin you're familiar with, where layer 1 is tightly capped and the network itself is becoming unusable while layer 2 creeps towards production."
Bigger blocks mean less secure. Bitcoin can have the security and much faster transactions with lightning. I wouldn’t trust BCH’s untested developers to increase the block size securely if it’s even possible.

bitpay is a pretty pathetic excuse for a crypto company. Adopted payment protocol and won’t let anyone bypass it because if people can actually use bitcoin (instead of whatever trash they’re peddling g next), they collapse. If a seller uses bitpay, the seller doesn’t really accept bitcoin.
"You make some great points. Educating BTC users that have the wrong information is definitely important​ I'm just worried with the amount of BTC negative threads, we come across as rampant fanboys frothing at the mouth and jumping on any proof we can that BTC is broken.

"The most ready market for BCH is BTC users who still think BTC works.  I don't think we need to stop getting out the word that BTC doesn't work.

There's no need to not be nice about it.

There are still a lot of BTC supporters who have never heard the other side of the story. I know it's wearisome to some people to talk about rbitcoin and BTC all the time. I know we need to do more to grow Bitcoin Cash than just try to compete with BTC.

"Flippening always referred to a  situation where BCH essentially takes BTCs position as king of crypto.

I think a flippening is coming but it's not going to be what people here think as much as I'd love (and profit from) that.

There are still too many people who have drank the core koolaid and think bitcoin cash is a scam. The real flippening will come when exchanges stop pairing every alt with BTC and open up pairs with other coins like ETH.

Overnight you will see BTCs dominance fall."
yo don't spam the network, it can't handle it, lol, decentralization
"Larger block sizes ultimately result in fewer nodes and thus greater centralisation. Additionally larger blocks only temporarily reduce transaction fees until that limit is reached. True transactional volume on the scale of visa would require Gigabyte scale blocks and are ultimately unfeasible. Onchain solutions like lightning which have been successfully tested are the ultimate solution of micro fees for small transactions. Larger blocks don’t produce the scaling required. 

Ping...Pong. 

P.S. Straw man: A person having no substance or integrity."
Traders there will also start thinking in terms of the BCH/BTC chart. Which, when the ratio of BCH to BTC price starts climbing, gets a lot of interest.
I think it means that it will let you trade one for the other without having to go through another currency. Maybe someone else can chime in though, because I thought most of the trading was done in terms of BTC, in which case BTC/BCH pairs would have already existed. Maybe you had to convert to USD and then to the other before?
"you will be able buy bitcoin cash with bitcoin, and vice-versa. as of today, you have to go through USD. so e.g. if you want bitcoin cash and have bitcoin, you have to sell BTC for USD, and then use the USD to buy BCH. this incurs more transaction fees and is a hassle in general.

what may (or may not) happen is that a lot of Coinbase/GDAX users, fed up with the fact that they cannot move their bitcoin, will trade it for bitcoin cash, which they can easily move. 

now you tick the box: the above scenario pushes the BCH price: down [  ] up [  ]"
"I agree.

We still gotta consider, it's by no means a surprise we all (me included) have such feelings of us vs. them. All these fake accounts running around and bothering us spreading fake outcry and lies about us make it hard to stay relaxed and level-headed. Along with their intent of deceiving newbies I'm sure that wearing us out like that is part of the intent.

Edit: For anyone wondering, just check the replies on [@Bitcoin's](https://twitter.com/Bitcoin) tweets for an example."
"If your BTC is in Coinbase, you shouldn't have to worry about a huge transaction fee, only the regular trade fees that Coinbase charges. You can minimize those by using GDAX to make the trade; get to know your fee schedules first and use the best tool for your job. Just don't send BTC over the network, that's how you get nailed by the BTC fees. GDAX<=>Coinbase transfers are free."
What a joke. All of you straw men coming in here promoting BCH as if you are having some kind of dialog. Koolaid indeed. Anyone with half a brain can see the truth and the markets don’t like BS. You may get a short term pump and be able to talk about going to the moon and talk flippening koolaid, but you’re just the AOL of the internets HTTP protocol. An attempt to centralise and have a CEO control a coin. Get ready for the ‘flash dash’ from BCH to BTC when the price is pumped enough. 
Moar Bad Facebook Reviews NOW!!!
Censored, they won't hear about it. The only reason they got to hear about Coinbase adding BCH before was because of the whole market manipulation story they were able to pull.
I'm talking about after that transfer. If you send from gdax to any external address, they pay the fee. I've done it many times.

"Trading securities is the same. Until the trade settles it is basically an IOU from the broker. 

It is silly that they consider going to USD or CAD a taxable event but the government has to trigger its tax collection based on something."
I don't think it will have any major effect on the short term price action, since people who really wanted too could already trade between the two coins. However, ease of transaction will certainly increase the pair's volume, perhaps even increase volatility during future major events.
"Thank you! That makes sense.

How come Coinbase/GDAX users couldnt move their bitcoin? Is it all the fees? I though that was the hottest biggest crypto at present?

Are other BTC/X pairs common for other cryptos or do most need to use USD to exchange?"
BCH just works now and for the foreseeable future. I like ETH and use it, but God it is painful.
"that seems so silly, not saying you're not right but it's silly, they're all the same ""kind"" really they're all coinbase IOUs :/"
for a lot of users, the bitcoin transaction fees are larger that their bitcoin balance. so they cannot move their funds.
For users in areas of the world where like-kind treatment can be used for the trade, it could result in movement. If there are people waiting for like-kind options to avoid taxable events then they could have been waiting to trade. If people were waiting to trade, it could have an effect. I can't predict what kind though... or even if any. Really I guess I'll just have to wait and see.
It's a nice step.  We should slowly start to see BCH pairs being added/expanded on other exchanges.  Once a larger global exchange like Binance decides to offer BCH trading pairs for all currencies, then you know what happens next...

"https://blog.bitpay.com/multiple-blockchains/

They're going to begin processing BCH payments once we have the new address format on the 14th. I'm guessing that they'll begin processing payments on Monday since the 14th is on the weekend."
"Yep that's certainly factors for a rally. And I agree the chart looks like it's been loading up pretty hard.

Coinbase already do BCH trading though so what would be too late would merely be the BCH/BTC pair for an extra boosting of this rally."
"Houston, we're hitting price ATH with bch and btc is reaching ATH with mempool.

Now that email is out, btc can't say there is no warning or insider trading."
ETH has at least a better scaling plan than BTC for the short term.
Oh wow, you're right! When did this happen?

I don't think you know what a straw man is.

Also, if you reread your text you'll notice you didn't bring any real argument. But if you want to talk about truths, here goes:

* The blockchain is a decentralized and trustless protocol.
* The BCH blockchain is faster and cheaper to use.

Agreed, except for the spontaneity of it all. Not all exchanges will list BCH as a base currency at the same time. However, any major exchange doing it would still have a huge effect... Let's say Bitfinex or Binance.

Bitfinex still calls Bitcoin Cash Bcash though, which is abominable. We should petition Binance!"
They're just making the fees higher for everyone, that's it. The network itself is working fine.

Question: for someone that has BTC currently in coinbase, would I be better off biting the transaction fee bullet now by pulling out now and switching it into BCH from USD or would you think its better to wait until Coinbase implements this?  Trying to make the most of the money I have.  
good. i like trading this pair on finex.. ill like trading it better on gdax.
This is great! I was planning to trade my BTC for USD and buy BCH, but now I'll just wait and trade direct!

Yeah. Apparently they don't batch transactions, and they're probably paying a decent fee since my balance shows up in my ledger pretty quickly (30 min. on avg. even while the mempool was pretty bad), so I'm not sure what their angle is. I'm sure they're making enough on the Coinbase side of the house to cover the expenses though.

"This debate has been had times and times again. Of course, brutish block size increase, taken to its extreme, will lead to centralization. But we are far from having reached that point, and technology is being developed to alleviate this problem.

Again, LN is no better. I personally think we need both a spacious blockchain and second layer solutions to decentralize. I’m sure you’ll get the same opinion from most people around here if you ask them.  LN might amount to something nice if it keeps evolving, but certainly not with huge fees that incentivize users to open one single channel to a huge central hub."
Think you'll find gigabyte blocks have been tested and work.
First Coinbase is spamming the network and clogging the mempool with their wasteful transactions (as if Bitcoin is some sort of currency) and now THIS???  [How dare they](https://media2.giphy.com/media/vk7VesvyZEwuI/giphy.gif)!? ^/s

I don’t understand why him being wrong about something means we should start treating people as if they are enemies, simply because they have an opinion on economic policy that we disagree with.

If you don’t share the values of the dev team of a currency, then why not just not use that currency? It’s not George Lucas ruining Star Wars, or the Yankees losing the World Series. It’s a marginal difference in the economic policy of a financial instrument.

"Segwit isn't *that* complex. Sure, it's more complex than just doubling the block size - but some companies implemented it in *days*. Or they were actually prepared - because segwit has been known for ages.

There is no evidence for it and they know it. Their reasoning is simply that they need to force the market to use second layer solutions otherwise Bitcoin won't work. They are open about it when you push them. I think they see themselves as benevolent dictators. They've realized that they could never get there by simply allowing the markets to take their course - it's something they don't understand anyway. All they've seen is a 'broken' technology they didn't invent - now they need to fix it and make it their own.

"It would be an interesting footnote in Bitcoins history if companies that chose to go the route of full licensing and regulation end up going out of business due to onerous requirements ; whereas businesses which chose to skirt the license and/or operate outside of overly regulated jurisdictions boom.

That is pretty anti-fragile if you ask me. Companies can inefficiently use the blockchain all they want; overpay and congest the network.  They can only do this as long as they make enough profit to do so. The market will trend towards greater efficiency so over time businesses with inefficient methods will go out of business. If they never go out of business then it must not be all that harmful.

If L2 solutions like LN is successful each blockchain Tx will end up representing thousands; maybe hundreds of thousands of LN Tx. If each blockchain Tx ends up representing 100,000 LN Tx ; each with a fee of $0.005; then each blockchain Tx could end up being $500 or more.

Eventually it will become cost prohibitive to inefficiently use the blockchain."

"just out of curiosity what would be the german take on ANTI Bitcoin Cash?

Isn't the primary difference between Bitcoin Cash & Bitcoin Obsolete the blocksize?  Are there any other major differences?"
I don't disagree with much of what you're saying. I guess I just don't take it as personally as you do.
"Well, you *say* that.

Last time I saw this mentioned, it was when Microsoft stopped accepting bitcoin. There was some false information that Microsoft was still accepting it, and /r/btc was saying how you can't point out the fact that Microsoft actually did stop accepting bitcoin on /r/bitcoin or they'll ban you.

I looked at the /r/bitcoin post about it, and literally every comment was saying ""Yeah, Microsoft actually did stop accepting bitcoin because the fees are too high and that's a problem.""

Why would you feel the need to make a personal attack like this? See what I mean about petty tribalism? Not everyone who says something you disagree with is your enemy. This is the entire point I'm trying to make here."
Again, I’m here objecting to exactly what you just did.
"When I refer to Bitcoin being anti-fragile; I'm referring to the network itself.

The vast majority of people in this world want their money stored with trusted 3rd parties. I'm not one of those people so I will choose to run my own LN Hub or transact on the blockchain itself. 

For spending the vast majority of people will keep their coins with a 3rd party that performs LN Tx on their behalf. The general public wants reversible Tx and they want someone to sue if their funds are lost.

For those that wish to be their own bank, like myself, we will run our own LN Hub/Node and keep our savings offline/airgapped. Top up my LN wallet once or twice a year depending on fee conditions.

My motivation in getting involved with Bitcoin is to displace the central banks. If we can displace Visa all the better; but my primary goal with supporting Bitcoin is displacing central banks. For that I believe decentralization of the base layer is of utmost importance. 

If your blockchain can be taken over because it is not sufficiently decentralized then it doesn't matter if you hold private keys or not. 

If you transact on a centralized 2nd or 3rd layer with LN and the centralized parties try to play foul; the worst that happens is you have to settle to the blockchain and the attacker never wins. "
What keeps you or anyone else from forking the codebase and doing what you want?
At the very least there exists a GROUP of individuals developing for it,  a group which is represented by many different companies and universities, unlike Bitcoin ABC, which makes 83% of bch network and is controlled by 1 developer who runs it like a dictator :D

"""many different companies and university"", actually is only one company and zero universities: Blockstream. Other core devs not employed by Blockstream are inactive, were kicked out or moved to other projects."

"I am satisfied with the current development direction of Bitcoin. I would like fee's to be lower but I am not willing to sacrifice decentralization of the base layer for lower fee's. 

Nobody is forced to use 2nd layers; they can always choose to transact on the blockchain itself. If the blockchain itself is centralized then people truly do not have a choice. If a person is sending $100k to family overseas they'll use a blockchain transaction. If a person is paying their rent or their groceries they'll use Lightning. 

Lightning nodes may or may not become KYC/AML targets. If you believe LN nodes will be targets because they are sending packets that represent money; why do you believe that regular nodes; and particularly mining nodes (who have some say over which Tx are included) will not come under KYC/AML jurisdiction?

The fact that LN operators are incentivized with revenue means that there will likely always be nodes willing to skirt KYC/AML. Bittorrent seeders risk their property and get nothing in return; LN nodes will have revenue that can be invested in increasing security/privacy.

This is a difference of opinion regarding the best method of scaling a brand new financial technology. To write people off who you disagree with as simply cognitive dissonance is doing yourself a disservice. This is a difference in philosophy.

People using 3rd party payment processors has nothing to do with disrupting central banks. As I've mentioned my main motivation for getting involved with Bitcoin is to disrupt the Central Banks. To disrupt the bodies with the ability to control interest rates; to disrupt their ability to inflate the currency at will. That is my primary motivation from which my other opinions regarding scaling are derived. I would be perfectly happy if VISA thrived while making the FED, ECB, and IMF obsolete. "

Oh damn, yeah you didn’t do anything wrong, you brought up fair points and they didn’t like that 
Yeah but the big difference is that /r/bitcoin removes anything that goes against their narrative and they also ban left and right. Here at /r/btc we have more freedom. Then they take advantage of that by coming here and trolling and shilling. 
Not to defend coinbase or anything, but my first hand experience is that basically all the exchanges are unreliable when the traffic is in a frenzy. Every single exchange I used had downtime at some point.
"It's mostly the stuff that you hear in English discussions as well, like the points that I loosely translate from the Austrian TenX founder [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7pvojj/_/dskvh3d). (TenX is a cryptocurrency-to-fiat credit card service and they are developing an atomic swap service as well, so he's got to be pretty knowledgeable. I'd think he'd actually do well to remain at least agnostic on this, in his own best interest.)

And of course a lot of people see the future in Segwit + LN and are optimistic on the development timeline, while disincentivizing full nodes will supposedly lead to centralizion and loss of overall security."
if you don't think the 12 people working for blockstream that work on core have strangled bitcoin and changed the fundamental working of the system than you are naive
Well yeah, I’m all over Reddit too, I just don’t comment much because I don’t have much to say, with bitcoin cash and bitcoin core there’s tons to talk about, hence why most of my more recent comments are in cryptocurrency subs, I presume it’s the same for people who comment solely on /r/bitcoin 
"It only means that Coinbase is by far the biggest exchange, owning 50% of total exchange's market. It's to be expected since the high fees hinders consumer's ability to move on another exchange, and new users usually land on Coinbase.

This also explains why they won't implement transaction optimizations: there's no economic incentive to do so, since even without those they're still #1."
I was not aware of that, I personally don’t exactly know how they plan on making this work I was just explaining their reasoning behind the lightening network

"Well, I see this from quite a different perspective. I ended up reading the white paper back in 2010 and immediately understood that this was incredibly powerful - a currency the world needed. For me Bitcoin represented an alternative to the follies of Central Banks, the start of something that could, if the cards were played right, create an alternative to the established financial system. I vested my name, resources, time and effort into Bitcoin. I created that first 3D rendering that really caught on and everybody used, even to this day. Its not that I disagree with Core, its that they have basically hijacked Bitcoin and want to take it in a _completely_ different direction. A direction that is _not_ aligned with the principles, ideals, philosophy that Bitcoin was _clearly_ meant to have. Look for example at the contents of the genesis block. Bitcoin was highly political from the very get go. If Core wanted to run their insane fantasy of forced 2nd layer scaling _they_ should have forked and left Bitcoin on the path that was intended. But they are _greedy_ on other peoples efforts and wanted to catch a free ride by taking the brand name into their possession. Now i'm in the position that i have to go around to the people i introduced Bitcoin to in the past and explain that the Bitcoin we signed up for is dying, the contents in the box called Bitcoin has been snuffed out and replaced with a poison seed. A seed that is destined to diminish the market dominance of bitcoin, a Trojan. The great alternative to central banks that had fantastic traction is fading.

If LN succeeds its going to become impossible for regular users to do on-chain transactions. Just imagine if there are millions and millions of users only using coins circulating on LN hubs. There will never be a need to have coins on a ""legacy"" wallet, just permanently on LN wallets. The aggregated transaction fees from all of the hubs compete for block space. The fees are going to moon. $32 now is going to turn into $3200 when hubs settle their balances. At bare minimum the LN should compete with on-chain transaction so that the market could decide what it wants. The market is pretty clear when it comes to Segwit, thumbs down, adoption is a disaster. The market don't want Cores vision.

Since Core used trickery and coercion to force Segwit on users, users now vote with their wallet - refusing to use Seqwit. Core needs to take a deep look in the mirror and grow up. If not Bitcoin dominance will continue to slip to single digit. Core can just praise themselves lucky Segwit was a softfork, because had it been a hardfork Bitcoin Cash would now be Bitcoin."

That is the factual experience of many people here at this sub. Discount the evidence if you wish, says more about you than anything else.

"If it is bad Customer Service, then do not use them, vote with your dollars.

Claiming they should spend money to get a 30% reduction in fees, that do not come out of their pockets, might not be the pinnacle of dumb, but it is close to it.

And claiming something, that changed so much of the client code, is not that complex, is disingenuous.  If it was not complex, more people would have it implemented and Core would have their GUI ready for it.  I mean they're the ones that forced this 'optional' garbage on everyone, are they not? They had the most time to be prepared and they are not."

"That's not conspiracy: a developer's group called Core (from the wallet name) has taken centralized control over bitcoin development. Their governance has caused Bitcoin to deviate from the original roadmap by refusing block size increases (also, a complete change of objective from ""peer-to-peer electronic cash"" to ""store of value"" and subsequent loss of a significant chunk of Bitcoin's market share).

That's both easily checkable facts."
"The comment sections at bitcoinblog.de, where core supporters apparently [frustrated the author quite a bit](https://bitcoinblog.de/2017/06/20/segwit2x-alpha-release-bereits-mehr-als-75-prozent-der-blocks-bereit/#comment-34778) even though he's usually a really calm guy who sticks to the facts pretty neutrally.

I also saw some on coinforum.de, but the threads I quickly reviewed right now are pretty decent on both sides. Not sure, I think I saw different tempers in November / December.

Otherwise the comments under some Youtube-Videos by TenX founder Julian Hosp, who himself seems to be one of the most subscribed people on Youtube & Facebook giving German explanations of cryptocurrencies. Even if you don't speak German, some words in this [video at 2m28s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?=zqWWOTHv6Yk#t=2m28s) might give you an idea what he's saying. (Merely a giant pump and dump, all just the doing of Jihan Wu und Roger Ver, the Bitcoin Judas, who's intent on splitting the community for power's sake and is pumping the price all on his own. Later he says BCH adds no value and merely copied Bitcoin's name and has hardly any developers while BTC has the best developers, and so on.)

And occasionally I spot the debate in random other places like the comment sections of Heise, Golem, and maybe even Spiegel."
I suppose this is the first time I've seen meaningful transactions pointed to.  Any other time it has been Roger or some boogeyman shifting money around they're complaining of. 
"This. Both subs are echo chambers that are equally gross to browse. r/bitcoin jerks itself off with price memes all day, and this subreddit is a giant incorrectly-titled cult trying to convince the world that Bitcoin Cash has been around since 2009. They're both heavily censored, one by the mods, the other by the users trying their hardest to stifle any mention of the currency that the god damn subreddit is TITLED AFTER. It's fucking weird. 

 Both subs need a new start, and this one needs to be re-titled r/BCH. Reddit is a resource a lot of people depend on to educate themselves and stay current, it's sad when politics ruins that utility (and in the case of these two subreddits, probably has a net negative effect). Reddit is usually better than this, it's frustrating to watch."

That's a brilliant solution.

The OP still actually cares what is going on at /r/Bitcoin.  Why?  What relevance does that have to anything?  Who cares if they are wrong again and again?  Try to get over that sub.  Try harder.  Don't go there.  There is no point in reading about their errors.
"To be fair I've noticed on withdrawals that they always consolidate the change address in a separate transaction. This happens even when withdrawing via GDAX.

For instance the other day I made a withdrawal and there was ~0.002 that was sent to an unused coinbase change address. Then what was really bizarre is that CB ""consolidated"" this into another address (with other inputs presumably other withdrawals were being consolidated here). But they ended up paying 0.0015 BTC in fee's on this 2nd transaction.

So to recap from my free GDAX withdrawal they paid a ~$20 Tx fee; and then they consolidated their change and paid another $20 Tx fee to recoup ~$5.

If they are going to consolidate anyways; why not just use the intended consolidation address as the change address and get it done in one Tx. They paid $40 in Tx fee's when they could get away with $5 or less. If they didn't double up their transactions and did batching once an hour their expenses would be far lower.

So it begs the question; it costs them much more than necessary to send Tx the way they do; so are they inefficient/incompetent or are they deliberately driving up fee's on BTC? Are they hamstrung by regulations and licensing?"
but its ok to have 300mb mempool suckin away the ram on your rpi till it explodes
All transactions are spam. The mempool should be empty aside from block rewards going to miners. /s

Don't care about the sub, care about Bicoin. A hell of a lot of people have bought into Bitcoin, still are. There is a (at the time of writing) 2598/13660 = 19% chance that they will end up as bagholders. If that happens its going to be bad for everyone, the entire crypto scene, not just Bitcoin. You should care too.
"Please enlighten me. I've asked on numerous occasions for some rationale behind the extreme rigidity. Simulations? Logic? Experiments? To this day i have not seen a single argument that is not a _value judgment_ why its ""dangerous"" to increase the blocksize. Zip. When i asked nullc about this, all he could produce was a link to some ramblings of lukejr. Lets have some stone cold facts backed by empirical evidence. Simulations of the bitcoin network with its current transaction volume (and greater) where the entire thing collapses if blocksize is increased."
Now post the exact same thing over at /r/bitcoin and count how long it is before you are banned.
"It's *exactly because* we know why they think this that people call them childrens. Grown ups actually run simulations, make experiments, produce actual facts and use those to back up their arguments and choose their side.

Only children take a stance based on pure faith and no data..."
"> If you understood why they think not raising the blocksize is a good idea, 

they aregue that it would make poor peope unable to run full nodes

Too Bad Satoshi literally designed bitocin so No One would have to run a full node

If you understand the history and how bitocin works, you can see their 'reasons' are bullshit"
"> And yes, perhaps Roger, though of that I do not know.

TIL Roger Ver is responsible for all that go wrong with BTC.

I thought nobody can stop decentralised cryptocurrency.. I guess I was wrong."
Segwit is complex, costly to implement and nearly no reward for doing so.  Do not blame companies for Developers garbage solutions.  Do not blame users for a broken system.  If you want companies to follow along, give them a simple solution, easy to implement, with great reward.  Give them a blocksize increase. This was all obvious years ago and those that are still blind to it, I feel, are doing so for malicious reasons.  You asked for a broken coin and guess what, you got a broken coin.
"*Scaling solution"" singular, also its optional. "
But mAh narrative!!!!
Circle has already set that precedent.
"u/playfulexistence, you've received `0.000269 BCH ($0.70404832 USD)`!

I think the goal of lightning hubs is to make it easy to set up so that everyone can set them up, that way there’s always competition and the fees for the hubs can’t get too high
Source please. 
That's the talk that teenage boys use to get in the pants of girls - say _anything_.
So I think they should be thankful for the Coinbase fees and users, and fix BTC, not sign petitions and whine. If BTC breaks down because of inefficient use at Coinbase, with users willing to pay for this, then BTC is not working. 
Just saying, they say the exact same thing about this place, I browse both and it’s surprising how similar the accusations always are 
"> Always a new redditor that only ever posted to /r/Bitcoin 

That is because there are assholes there and here that downvote you to hell for not following the groupthink. It is absolutely no surprise that someone would want a segregated account from their main to use these subreddits"
Gold is heavy, much like BTC is weight-heavy.
"The new account double standard is mind blowing over there too.

    * Redditor for 1 week: ""Bcash sucks. 1MB helps promote decentralization!""
    * Corean: ""See? The new guy gets it!""

Versus

    * Redditor for 1 week: ""You guys realize your transaction would go through if the block was bigger, right?""
    * Corean: ""Tell me more, 'Bcash shill for 1 week'."""
"I post in many crypto subs and I've started responding to the ones who say shit like ""btrash"" and almost 100% of the time they do not engage me. It really feels like bot activity or just pure trolling because they pop into any topic where BCH is mentioned and say ""btrash"" and then never appear again."
The point here it's that it is not a news: **of course** when a major exchange goes down there will be less transactions. That should be even more obvious for a coin that can only be used for market speculation and not for buying goods/services...
"> Which would suggest Coinbase is responsible for 50% of all transaction volume on Bitcoin.

Sounds like /r/bitcoin is poking a hornet's nest then. What if coinbase becomes hostile towards the core chain? (not likely since they are raking in the dough with it)"
Paid transactions have been classified as spam for a while. The famous one was the set of transactions that added the whitepaper to the blockchain. Many consider that spam. Luke was bitchin about Satoshi Dice and tried to black list their address to prevent their 'spam'
This isn't new. This has been going on for a long time. Blocks full? Then I clearly must be spam, right?
I dunno I’ve heard a lot of negative things about coinbase, issues with people not being able to withdraw, heck a few weeks ago when bitcoin dropped to 14k they stopped all transactions, which either means they’re trying to control the flow of currency or just unreliable
