"So then it's clear you have no idea what you're talking about.

1) bigger blocks don't mean less nodes. In fact small blocks like right now ensure no new nodes, therefore static blocks mean no growth. While adding tens of millions of users will bring not only people and business who want to run nodes, but they will be able like they are not today.

2). centralization comes from the bank controlling the ledger, therefore decentralized means to split up this power. Therefore non mining nodes don't matter for decentralizations, THis is a manipulation tactic and you've fallen fully for it. 

3) Satoshi's plan was for some tens of thousands of miners in every part of the world, your scenaarios still fails here, yet another strateey to stop bitcoin from working via full blocks is in full effect.

"There are many solutions to the large node problem that are being developed.  For example, checkpoints, universal UTXO format, trusted syncing, etc...

So, in the reasonable future, it could be expected than it would be much easier to run a node compared with today, even with 10x blocksize and beyond.  So, you are looking to technology to move tx to 2nd layer, which is fine, but technology moves forward in all directions, so the ""large node problem"" doesn't seem that big of a problem to tackle."

"> If fees are high, Lightning might the the only way to send small transactions.

And for some sense of small, this is already the case. You can do micropayment channels or payment channel networks (=LN without the marketing hype) with Bitcoin right now.

And you can use it to send single Satoshis. But you can't do that 
with on-chain Bitcoin as-is, and you'll likely never be able to do that cost-efficiently (again).

So this is all a matter of degree.

I actually do think a cup'o'coffee is actually long term viable on chain (with fees in the 1ct .. 5ct range for an on-chain transaction), but in any case, more than 3 txn/s are now and clearly so. And this is what counts and all we want to change with a simple raise of the MBSL."
let us please not forget this, amongst the rest of the shit show that we have been forced to listen to over scaling over the last three years.

"**Root name server**

A root name server is a name server for the root zone of the Domain Name System (DNS) of the Internet. It directly answers requests for records in the root zone and answers other requests by returning a list of the authoritative name servers for the appropriate top-level domain (TLD). The root name servers are a critical part of the Internet infrastructure because they are the first step in translating (resolving) human readable host names into IP addresses that are used in communication between Internet hosts.

A combination of limits in the DNS and certain protocols, namely the practical size of unfragmented User Datagram Protocol (UDP) packets, resulted in a decision to limit the number of root servers to thirteen server addresses.

I know what a root server is. We're saying the same thing. Sure Google is pwned but it's just an example that you can pick and choose who resolves domain names to IP addresses. Google could easily add Namecoin's root server and suddenly .bit addresses will work.

It's pretty obvious to me and others that have been around for a while. I noticed that most people that have been around since before blockstream understand blockstreams nature

I've never seen a small blocker make estimates of cost of running a full node and quantify these arguments.  Frankly, I doubt that any of the small blockers are capable of doing these calculations or estimates, since I've not seen one of them.

Because small blockers have been making the claim without backing up the claim with any numbers, I have concluded that they are a bunch to technical bullshitters, incompetents, or liars."

Because I think once we have done the first hard fork the ecosystem will learn that we can do it without permission from core or whoever steps up.
Miners no longer cowering in a corner afraid of Core threats.
The issue is if the block congestion still persists, the incentive to adopt segwit will come first vs on-chain scaling. This will make wallets adopt segwit format as default policy. It will be impossible to convince miners to hardfork and ignore segwit.

"These issues have been on the table for some years.  I have made many such requests on r/btc in discussions regarding LN.  Similarly, u/jstolfi has raised similar issues.

Open source code by itself is useless.  For it to be useful it has to be deployed.  People will deploy, run and use code only if it does something for them.  Thus, there is a basic need for any successful development project to solve a real need for some real users. 

Because real engineering involves tradeoffs, there will always be wish lists of possibilities to include in the scope of a project, but not all goals will be simultaneously achievable.  Thus there have to be tradeoffs. These can not be made in a vacuum.  These depend on a demonstrated need or a vision of a possible need.

No.

Furthermore, I loudly and vehemently proclaim that there is absolutely nothing like this level of demand for Bitcoin, even under the wildest, most rosy adoption hopes, in the near-to-mid term (next 5+ years).  Using this as a point of argumentation is disingenuous.

You are like someone arguing ""TCPIP can't work because obviously it cannot scale to stream every conceivable form of media, we need a 'Layer 2' network for meda"" in 1981.  Which by the way was a thing.  The idea that every hub could be a switch was a long, long, *long* way away.  ""Internet"" meant ""damn near every computer on the network saw every damn packet.""

I for one am glad we didn't scuttle TCPIP because people couldn't see how it could be made to natively scale up.
___
If we remove the block size limit the next natural hard limit is 32MB.  That's a block size that *we can support today* which, with some other optimizations that are already in production, can take us to 100-200 tps onchain.  That's enough to be able to actually onboard an extra million or so people looking for safe haven in the event of a major currency collapse.  If that happened today, Bitcoin would be left out.

32MB blocks / 100-200 tps - is only *one* order of magnitude from being in the ballpark at Visa's normal run-rate (~3000 tps).  Which is *absolutely* do-able in a few years.

Millions of people all around the globe already have gigabit internet.  On my internet, I can upload a **1GB** block in under 30 secs.  That is *doable* on today's technology, with a little work (sharding, pruning, etc).  We can *absolutely* get there in 5-10 years.

**Bigger than Visa**

**100% onchain**

**No vaporware required**"
"Define your terms. I'm going to do that then you can either dispute my definitions or my argument that on-chain scaling is compatible with the terms as defined.

- Security: Irreversibility of payments. The relative irreversibility of payments, in the long run, is proportional to total miner fees. On chain scaling can achieve higher total fees than moving payments off-chain.
- Decentralization (part 1): Number of actors that must cooperate to 51% attack the network. Centralization mostly driven by economies of scale in ASIC manufacturing and mining farm operation. Headers-first mining (ugly as it is) negates the block-size driven advantage that miners with good internet have over miners with worse internet.
- Decentralization (part 2): Cost of knowing the transaction paying you, and the block it's included in, are valid and therefore unlikely to be orphaned. SPV + Fraud proofs can solve this handily. If you feel that's too handwavy I'll have to write a proper explanation of how to do this.
- Cheap AF: < $0.05 fees. We've definitely had that fee range in the past, when block sizes weren't constrained.
- Every coffee purchase of the world on chain: 2 billion per day (most of these aren't actual commercial transactions, but we'll ignore that for a second), about 25,000 tx/s about 10x the average Visa TPS. At this point (or rather, long before this point) you'd need to paralellize block validation and processing: Signature validation and stateless validation is trivially parallelizable, handling ""already-spent"" and ""never-created"" outputs would require a technique like [the one used by bitcrust](https://github.com/tomasvdw/bitcrust/blob/master/doc/bitcrust-db.md)."
"> BC thats a proven fact too.

Show me the proof. I have given technical arguments for the opposite."

Simply because Adam back and Greg don't want to does not mean it's impossible. Greg also said decentralized consensus was impossible, yet here bitcoin is.

"> the distributed centralised network, but then did the maths on a hierarchically based tree topology

There is no difference between a distributed centralized network and a tree topology other than how you draw it, right?  This may be a naive view.

If you arrange the biggest hub (most connections) in the middle, with the next largest around it, and the leafs outside, that looks like a centralized distributed network.  If instead you arrange it with the biggest node at the top, and the next biggest underneath, etc. then it looks like a hierarchy."

">The internet is rather decentralized, would you not say?

No. It is composed of peer to peer components, but the emergent topology is hub and spoke, with the biggest hubs serving the bulk of the routing. Most of the world's internet traffic flows through a very small number of backbones.

Decentralized routing is not solved. The internet solves it by allocating IP addresses via a centralized governance hierarchy. Take away hierarchical IP numbering and the internet falls down completely. It is an unsolved problem for the internet and it is an unsolved problem for lightning. "
"> You can talk to anyone on the internet, and your messages run all over the world without a single entity routing your traffic. Instead, that task is performed by a network of smaller routers, switches, bridges, and/or hubs.

Amazing how cypherpunks think that the internet is a natural resource like air or sunlight, above and beyond the reach of governments.

Sorry to disappoint you, but the internet is run by a handful of big telecom companies, that have no desire to stand up against local governments to protect the privacy or some other rights that some users may think they should have.  The internet is in fact highly centralized -- not physically, but administratively.  

> What would be the problem of a company running a lightning network system with a bunch of routers keeping track of pathing.

It will lose the two supposedly great advantages of bitcoin: anonymity and resistance to blocking.  The hub company will know exactly how much you paid to whom, and can block your payments for any reason it cares.  Moreover it can charge you the fees that it wants.

> Running a lightning network does not require vast amounts of users. What if you want to set up your own network with family, some friends, your employer, your dog?

Because the money you lock up in that family network will be good only for paying the users of that network.   How often do you need to make a non-refundable payment to your sister-in-law, that you cannot trust a bank to carry it?

Moreover, the LN only works if it serves a population that is mostly economically closed -- that is, almost all the money that each user received through the LN will be spent through the LN.  If your employer pays you through the LN, but your landlord, supermarket, gas station, and dentist all want dollars or on-chain bitcoins, then the channel from your employer to you will be exhausted after the first salary.  It means that he will do two on-chain transactions for each payment to you, instead of just one (if he did not use the LN) or zero (if he did not use bitcoin at all).

Bitcoiners have no idea how irresponsibly incompetent are the supposed experts who are now in charge of the system.  "
"> When SegWit activates you will see all the fud for what it is. Blocksize will increase to 2mb and scaling will continue.

"You don't use exchanges to make payments with.
I mean, some people did use MtGox as their wallet, but it wasn't the norm."
"Yes, there is. Bitcoin doesn't require exchanges to function. Lightning requires hubs to function.

With LN being the dominant mode of value transfer, LN hubs **must** be used to conduct commerce. With Bitcoin transactions being the dominant mode of value transfer, exchanges are not required to conduct commerce."
"> Busy but available

You misunderstand. This is an oxymoron. Busy funds are temporarily unavailable for spending, while they are being used to negotiate another transaction. You can't spend them because they are required to settle someone else's transaction first - if you did, their transaction would fail. Conversely, if someone spent their funds while your transaction was using them to negotiate a payment, your payment would fail.

> airport

Air traffic IS a hub-and-spoke model. Major airports service each other and minor airports. You cannot avoid any hub you like, anyone familiar with air travel (or know people that frequently do!) will tell you that it's either transfer at the airport you don't want to be at, or miss your appointment. For example, I live somewhere that is serviced by a large international airport and a small local airport. It is impossible for me to get from here to many destinations by air, without passing through either my local international airport, or one of only two other international airports that are within range of the small one. Since most of the major flights that pass through here come from one of those other two airports, it's practically impossible for me to avoid that airport when flying.

There are hundreds and hundreds of international airports out there, but the fact is I must use one of only three if I wish to fly, and I am forced to use my local international airport and another undesirable airport if I wish to fly in a timely fashion. Sure, there _could_ be more flights here, and I _could theoretically_ avoid an undesirable airport, but I don't _actually_ have the option.

LN is practically begging for the analogy equivalent of a winter snowstorm. Exchanges mitigate DDoS as well as they can and have failsafes in place to protect user funds. Their performance is based on their ability. Meanwhile, LN has a failsafe ... that ties up your funds for longer, performs based on participation (which means lack of participation due to unforseen circumstance is a risk surface), and even has a resolution path that ends in _loss of funds_.

"This centralization myth is getting out of hand.
As Craig Wright states:

“There are around 15000 banks. Add financial organisations including savings and loans... We are up to 60,000. Then add in all the major merchants and operations that need to have transaction data by law, and that’s around 17 million organisations. That is decentralised do you not think?”

The idea of mining farms was always a concept from the first days of Bitcoin... 

We need to think Big - that one day it will be a global currency - so much so that even Banks will be forced to adopt it - as it is. On Chain.

"
Why?  Bitcoin miners have never dictated software requirements to the community, even the so-called monopolists.  Developers, on the other hand...
OK, let's have this discussion, then. Explain why.
"Correct me if i'm wrong but if there are 10 million users with 11 channels each that would mean that each user(or pair of users really) could open about 2 channels per year before the entire network capacity of bitcoin is consumed.


"
"> The problem with that counterargument is that's a very specific behaviour we're privileging, and while it does give you shorter paths than ""pick at random in advance"", it gives you longer paths than ""make at least one of your connections to the most central node in the graph"" 

That is a theoretical problem, yes.  Then there is the practical problem that opening a new channel entails two on-chain transactions (open and eventually close) hence two fees and two delays of 10 minutes (expected) or more.  And the user must commit **new** bitcoins to that channel: he cannot use any of the bitcoins that he has already locked in his other channels.

Moreover, I believe that, with such a ""solution"", the number of channels per user will end up being substantially larger than what would be enough for a tree of height X.  Even if the payments that each user wishes to make were highly skewed towards a small set of habitual trading peers.

Since the LN idea came out, I have been asking the authors to provide a hypothetical future scenario -- with 10 million users and other parameters like topology, number of ""merchants"", number of channels per consumer and per ""merchant"", distribution of payments, etc. -- so that we could run such simulations.   They never answered.  In fact, every conversation with them ended in silence whenever I asked that.  I can imagine why: any scenario that I can think of is obviously shown to be not viable, by calculations that one can do in one's head.

Well, the miners don't (fully) agree yet. 
"I think you're overestimating the control TPTB have over miners, or at least a supermajority of them. Why would >90% of them have agreed to sw2x if they didn't intend on following through? Pure sw has been an option for a while, and it never reached 40%. If you think the BU-supporting miners are being duped, well, then... Bitcoin's designed incentives mechanisms will have failed us, so I think in that case we're perfectly justified to see bitcoin die. Tough, but that's the way things work.

"Hey maybe. I definitely do hope thatcs what will happen, but i'm no fool, and if what you suspect comes to pass, I'll accept bitcoin has failed.

Good to get HF for that, but yeah indeed the discount can be change this (or at peast reduced)
Are you asking me why centralization of a currency that's most important idea is decentralization is bad?
It would be a soft-fork to remove the discount.  Essentially, you would be limiting the size of the signature space.  You would run a node that requires the signature space to be 1/4 of the size other nodes are enforcing - softforking nodes would reject old blocks but the soft-forked blocks would be accepted by old nodes.

What about sidechains? That can be part of the longterm scaling plan too, lightning doesnt need to solve everything to be valuable. Imo, it can be just decentralized, not distributed, to be valuable as well.
As block reward diminishes, the fees on later 1 will have to get much higher than they are now. So layer 1 will only be for important transactions, and regular users have to be moved to layer 2 for their coffee purchases. This is how we achieve both scalability and censorship resistance, and it's probably how Satoshi would solve the scalability issue if he were around. 
do you agree that max. security, decentralization and cheap AF and all of it on-chain isn't possible to scale for every coffee purchase of the world? BC thats a proven fact too. Now you are in a dilemma and here starts the interesting discussion, no matter if you like it or not and we need concepts with trade-offs in terms of these three things (max. security, decentralization and cheap AF), your 2$ purchase does not need as much security as a 1MM transaction but it needs to be a lot cheaper than the 1MM one, imo thats kinda common sense

"> is not true, if you take the channels to be bidirectional. If you have a closed cycle of Alice - Bob - Charlie - Alice. You only need one hop, in either direction to transfer value from Alice to Bob, even though Charlie is part of the cycle. 

Perhaps it would be better to restate the question as ""What is the maximum number of people I can reach in n hops or less with x connections?"" In your example, the Bob-Charlie link is a wasted link from Alice's perspective. If it didn't exist, Alice would still be able to send money to Bob and Charlie in one hop. Likewise, if we replace that replaced that link with a Bob-David connection, Alice would be able to reach one more person in 2 hops than she would with the cycle. 

If it helps, you can re-frame the argument by saying that the tree is a BFS tree of the lightning network of the shortest paths from Alice to everyone else. In this case view, we are only counting connections which add new people to the network (which are a subset of the total number of connections, meaning the true number of connections would have to be even higher).

"> For things like micro-payments (low value, low risk tranasctions), I fail to see why off-chain solutions like changetip was are not a suitable solution.

There you have your answer.  Changetip was centralized, hence it was much faster and cheaper than any decentralized solution can be.  Yet it folded because it was financially unsustainable: the cost of executing those small transactions was not covered by the value (hence the fees) that the service provided.

Moreover, the $0.05 to $1.00 payments that ChangeTip carried are not exactly what micropayments is usually assumed to mean.  The term usually means paying fractions of a cent, mostly automatically, for atomic activities like doing a Google search, sending a tweet or email, issuing a data packet, or fetching a webpage.  

**Unidirectional payment channels** between user and provider of the service could carry such small payments at fairly low cost.  I suppose that, for each micropayment, one message from consumer to service would suffice: namely the consumer would have to send a new signed transaction to the provider through some channel, and the provider would have to receive and validate it.  (But I am not sure; maybe two or more messages may be needed for each micropayment.)

However, an on-chain transaction, with attendant locked-up bitcoins, tx fees, and delay, would be needed to set up the channel.  Moreover, the first payment would have to include the fee to close the channel at the end. So that method would be worth only if one expects to make  extensive use of that service.  In which case a pay per hour or per month scheme would be much better in all respects.

The **Lightning network** would remove the need to create a channel to every new service provider, but would make each micropayment much more cumbersome and expensive.  The user would have to contact a routing service to find a multihop route, then negotiate the chain of linked payments with all nodes involved, and pay fees to all middle nodes; and then they all would have to notify the Vigilante services to watch for fraud attempts -- not for each customer-service pair, but **for each micropayment**

Indeed the creator of ChangeTip seemed to have a prestige in the Bitcoin Circles way off proportion to the size of his company (whose turnout presumably was measured in dollars -- not billions, not millions, not thousands, but just dollars.

A path that goes through three hubs will cost three times as much in hub fees, and the 20 hubs together will need to tie up a lot more bitcoins in their outgoing channels than a single hub would need.  Those are strong forces leading to concentration of hub services in a single company.

More efficient? Not by monetary standards, your spending power in a Lightning network is diminished by its use during negotiation of channel hops. Secure? Rather the opposite - dependency on a countersignature is the inverse of personal security. Better designed? That's a flat joke - it's design is a mirror of legacy settlement networks.

> but developing the game theory mechanics in such a manner to include a weighting representing the beneficial behaviour of those within the network to ensure bitcoin is protected from those nefarious agents outside of the network, is actually very clever.

Clever or no, it introduces a risk surface for participants that doesn't exist under Bitcoin's security model. Weighting doesn't solve the problem. It's fairly trivial to craft hostile activity in a manner that appears legitimate. Bitcoin has an incentive structure that is designed so that the consequences of hostile behavior are immediately damaging to the bad actor. The argument that ""people have a vested interest in making it work"" isn't enough. There needs to be immediate consequences for hostile activity that doesn't require intervention on the part of the victim, otherwise the network cannot remain peer-to-peer nor resistant to influence. Lightning's model fails on this front, and this is the most egregious sacrifice of all."

You must be new to bitcoin.

They admitted back in 2014 already that pegged sidechains, their original idea for the layer 2 network, would not work.  

Liquid is not meant to be a layer-2 solution; it is a commercial product that they sell to exchanges, and is supposed to let them move bitcoins quickly among themselves to give them the edge on arbitrage.  

So their official layer-2 solution, for the past 2 years or more has been the Lightning Network; and they speak about it as if it was a given fact.

As I understand it, the answer to this question is as follows:

1 + x  + x(x-1) + ...  + x(x-1)^n

This is a hard upper bound, given a maximum node degree of x for the entire graph and a hop limit of n.   This bound can be achieved by a tree topology rooted on the source node.  Such a topology will not provide the required capability for arbitrary source nodes, as it has to be engineered for the benefit of a specific node.  However, if one is prepared to double the hop limit then arbitrary nodes can connect to arbitrary nodes.  (There are a range of tradeoffs between x and n for a given size network. Two extremes involve a cyclic graph where every node is of degree 2 or less and the hops is half the number of nodes and a fully connected graph, where hops is 1 and each node is of degree one less than the number of nodes.)

Bidirectional payment channels also exist and can be used, but they do not quite work, because they are not secure: one of the parties can cancel payments that he made to the other by sending ""stale checks"" to the miners.  To prevent such fraud, one or both parties must watch the blockchain continuously and react promptly when they see an attempt at such fraud.  This is impractical.
Moreover, bidirectional channels are more complicated to use than unidirectional ones. They only would make sense in the context of the LN.

The LN would be a payment network that uses multi-hop paths of bidirectional channels to send payments between hundreds of millions of users.  As explained in that article, the idea is clever -- but cannot possibly work. "

Bitcoin always needed a way to transfer value from fiat to bitcoin to be a currency. While this would have been possible without exchanges, it would have been very very difficult to do in mass scale without. Without a transfer of value from fiat to bitcoin, bitcoin was nothing more than a distributed consensus network. 

> It existed before exchanges came to be, and it can exist in a world where exchanges have ceased to be. 

This is very optimistic, unless you envision a point at which crypto does not transfer value between fiat currency. Is this the case? 

If it is not the case, then exchanges will always exist. Even if exchanges become decentralised through peer 2 peer systems of fiat to crypto exchange, you will still get centralisation within those systems - as some 'exchangers' will hoover up most of the business - similar to how you see top sellers on localbitcoins.

This may be true - but developing the game theory mechanics in such a manner to include a weighting representing the beneficial behaviour of those within the network to ensure bitcoin is protected from those nefarious agents outside of the network, is actually very clever. i.e those within LN may act more empathetically, if they believe that their actions will ensure the system remains a) peer to peer, and b) resistant to outside state influence/attack.

"He did math but not the right math.

His argument is in order for LN to scale infinitely you need an infinite amount of bitcoin.

We already have off chain transactions they are called altcoins. LN insist an altcoin where everyone agrees the altcoin is worth 1:1 bitcoins.

Say Coinbase makes its own LN. All day trading inside coinbase would be off chain. It will need to eventually deposit or withdraw funds from the main chain or liquidity will suffer. However that would be 1 transaction instead of 1000x a day."
For LN to be useful requires either a large number of intermediaries or a large number of open channels, both of which are prohibitively costly. Using the most generous assumptions, the actual economic utility of a LN-style economic network is less than 30% of the Bitcoin network due to the higher functional overhead and additional prerequisites for commercial activity. The numbers demonstrate conclusively that, even given rose-goggles estimations of throughput and adoption, LN cannot provide an economically viable routing system for payments.

Problem No.1 is, that some LN-salesman talk about hub/client and others about decentralized networks.

I am very confident, that it is impossible to build another layer on top of the bitcoin blockchain, that allows for transactions with the same properties as the current Bitcoin transactions. You will always make tradeoffs, let it be security or fungibility or something else. If you were able to build a 2nd layer on top of bitcoin which was ""just bitcoin transactions"" (as core devs like to talk about LN), just cheaper, why would anybody use layer 1?

I'm still wondering, how LN routing is supposed to scale. The current LN proposal scales much worse than Bitcoin and it is also more insecure and complicated. All it does, it makes working with Bitcoin worse.


Of course there is a case for micro(!)transactions do be done offchain. This could be done with current technology (micropayment channels are available forever) or with some kind of degenerated LN-hub-client system (which is overhyped to no end, but has some small improvements over known micropayment channels)."

A has a bi-directional-channel with B.

Now B wants to send you 1000 satoshi, and he has lots, so he just opens a new channel directly with you, funds it himself with a ton of money (makes no sense to open a channel with a small amount in relation to fees).

Now you don't want to ""lock up"" more money in Lightning, but you want to send him something back. So you could just use your existing channel with A, since it is already funded."

Nobody sane, however tought otherwise, and most sources claim correctly that LN means SOME degree of centralization, and it looks more like a claim the writer of the article tried to desperately hold on to to try argue against it.

This degree of 'centralization' is obviously still far-far-far-far-far less severe than in the case of FIAT.

And you would never need to do all your transactions through it, just the relatively smaller / less important ones, that make up the vast of the pressure on the network.

Micro/'Lightning Fast' transaction will never be possible in a fully decentralized way with the current blockchain technologies. Look at the scaling issues that began to hit ETH recently.

And the 'mathematical proof' part is literally laughable, based on an oversimplifications that make it perfectly worthless."
Yes, some people like to tout it as P2P, even.  The reality is that there are ways to make it *somewhat* P2P, but enormous economic pressures for centralization, moreso than with Bitcoin mining but just like any other currency.
Based on the assumptions stated in the article, what are your qualms with the proof provided?
"I think LN could find a place in the grand scheme of things. It's not the savior that some people think it is, but that's fine. Put it out there, if it's better at some things then great. But we need to keep layer one running and being upgraded at the same time. 

I don't know why that's so complicated for some! :-("
"> Furthermore, a distributed network can have leaves (clients which only have one channel open). The core of the network would still be distributed in such case. In other words: you can have distributed hubs which cater to most transactions. While not being centralised. 

So, just like Bitcoin with SPV and full nodes, with the minor but important difference that I can connect my SPV client to any (or at least a multitude) of full nodes ...

I am not opposed. But not at all a panacea, and not a full alternative to interacting directly with the chain.

And most likely unusable for anything larger than small/micro transactions.

It should be noted that e.g. Greg said it will *not* be hub and spokes and rather a mesh network. Showing (once again) the honesty of those pushing SegWit and their variant of payment channels, marketed as 'LN'.

Please everyone: spread this article far and wide."
LN is a good evolution for the blockstream nevertheless, but it's not a scaling solution.
I am sure LN will be centralized but i don't think it will be a problem. LN doesn't need trust. If a LN hub go bad people will just switch to another one. I think exchanges and payment providers will be big LN hubs.
Did someone ever claim otherwise?
*not a mathematical proof.
I thought that LN acknowledged it was centralized, but that the developers believe that is the required tradeoff for scaling without impacting the security of the bitcoin blockchain.  Ignoring whether their assumptions are correct, is that not what they say?
Question. Why do I HAVE to choose a LN I don't like. Won't there be competition and if all else fails, why can't I continue to transact on-chain if I felt inclined to?

"The point he's making is that the funds are *busy*, not gone. The part about ""everybody is lending"" has more detail on this point.

There is no such thing as a decentralized hub. That's like hydrophobic water or a cold summer heat. A hub is, by definition, a point of centralization.

Interest and fees. Fuck outta here with this LN shit honestly. 
Peer to Peer and decentralized is all bitcoin is. Anything that is not peer to peer decentralized has no place here. Looks like Blockstream is about to figure that out 
"It's a shame you're being downvoted for pointing this out. LAtely it seems this sub is on a quest to prove the highest purity to the cause.

We all hate SegWit. We hate its shitty hackiness, its technical debt, and the fact that it was being pushed by an org wh owanted to benefit from a strangled blocksize. But it's not the end of the effin world, especially if finally there is consensus on a HF. This indeed will open the doors to higher blocksizes, hopefully to the point where this debate won't happen again; and blockstream's aim to restrict on-chain scaling for the sake of their business is foiled in the process.There's no need for a lightning network if transactions become reliable and cost a few cents again.

This opens the door to other HFs as well, and the community will remember all the times the Core Devs yelled bloody murder about the possibility of a HF. The Core Devs will be out with this upgrade, even if some of their code ends up being activated. Yes, we'll have to deal with a slightly brainwashed community and a few corrupt miners, but the momentum will no longer be the status quo. From here on out, we will be able to fix the damned transaction format, and while today it seems a bit impossible, I have no doubt somebody can come up with a way to extricate SegWit from the codebase without risking effin-up the anyone-can-spend transactions (and honestly, it's probably as easy as deprecating SW txns for a while, and once the blockchain has buried them to the point where rolling it back to get at those transactions would be tremendously nonsensical, we'll be cool).

A compromise of any kind has historically always irked the extremists at either side, so let's not be extremists. This is not some cunning trick by blockstream to get SW activated (and if it is, they're just really stupid about it, because it won't lead to their desired outcome), this was the only possible way that we would achieve a majority miner support for a HF, let alone a supermajority. Let's celebrate this, at half mast if you so desire, but we **are definitely moving forward**. 

Come on, guys, don't be like Churchill. The guy thrived during WWII, and then became a shitty and bitter PM during peace time. The end of the war is within arm's reach, and while some reparations will certainly be in order, this is undoubtedly cause for celebration."
This was common sense all along. This is about control. 
"> Still a ""centralized"" hub can't steal your bitcoin from you.

It can hold (edit: place a hold on) your funds. For that reason alone hubs are very likely to require licensing."
It is my expectation that Bitcoin Exchanges that rapidly extend their network to include Lightning Network will become something akin to banks as they were 100 years ago. Storage of bitcoin, rapid transactions between users of the same network, easy liqudation to and from fiat.
"> Still a ""centralized"" hub can't steal your bitcoin from you.

Are we sure of that? If a centralized LN hub was to be closed, or raided, or pull a Pirateat40 or gox, you can end up in a bank-run situation where everybody has to close their channels simultaneously before timelocks expire on thief transactions. 

Blockstream/Core's vision for how Bitcoin will pay for PoW is a fee market with constant mempool backlog^^[[1]](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5ut05w/why_im_against_bu/ddxr8ks/) and a hard limit to make miners choose few-high‐fee-transactions instead of many-low‐fee-transactions. Think what happens to a time-critical breach remedy transaction when the blockspace is fixed, already backlogged, and everybody else must also get theirs confirmed in time. 

To make it worse, fees will spike from increased demand but the breach remedy transactions still only pay out the same fee, so to get them confirmed everybody has to raise that fee... by throwing more transactions into the traffic jam (CPFP).

> Decentralized with centralized hubs was always how it was proposed. 

This makes its hubs a target for regulation, and censorable.

"> Wanna know why'? Side-chains. Blockstream was funded on the condition they implement segwit to enable side-chains.

~~That statement is true.~~ AFAIK, Blockstream indeed was created to exploit the ""pegged sidechain"" idea.  However, even Blockstream concluded shortly after that sidechains would not work.  (Unless they are feigning it and have some secret solution that would make them work; which I doubt.)

Fortunately for them, the Lightning Network idea came out at the right time. It is complicated enough that they can pretend that it will work, that it will start working as soon as SegWit is approved, and will solve the ""scaling problem"".

If layer 2 has more users than later 1 expect layer 1 to diminish as the block reward is diminished.

The median bitcoin node today has a 50 megabit/s connection, measured by Cornell. Xthin solved block propagation time.

**AND:** Non mining nodes are just observers, not enforcers. They are not a part of the bitcoin security model. SPV wallets is all users need. It's the mining pools that have to keep up with the transaction capacity increase. And that is peanuts for nodes that have 1% of hashpower behind them."

what about L3/4/5, we dunno what the future holds, anyway i'm more then optimistic, there are some awesome ideas floating around ..
"I've just started with a light/fast reading so I might be missing something buuut, just at the very beginning he starts saying possible payments paths from you to any other nodes forms a tree, where you'd be the root and each child a payment channel, therefore your saving would be split....but that's not true, depending on the network topology, you could find a path to most nodes through any of your payment channel, you could even find a path from one of your payment channel to any of your other payments channel (sending money to yourself so equilibrate your channel's balances ).

He also takes numbers very arbitrarily, like saying there could be 20 hops...there are 7,000,00, 000 people in the world and it is estimated there are only 6 hops, ( on bitfury simulation they usually imply something between 3 to 5 hops ).

I'm not saying he is not right, he might be; but he looks arbitrary in his assumptions, he should make a simulation to get a better intuition whether his assumptions are realistic or not.
"
So are all people implementing it now stupid if there are no advantages? Why are people switching to it?
"LN has to have segwit activated to be functional, and with segwit active, blocks won't be full.

Segwit is a block size increase. No I'm not that dumb."
You don't have to pay a 3rd party. You can run it yourself. Hence no Trust. 
You can watch it yourself. And it is meant to be for small transactions. You would have open channels for small amounts.
Does not remove the fact that you can also still close the multisig transaction on your own accord if need be.
"If mtgox goes bad, you loose money if you keep your btc there. If one hub goes bad you close your channel you just loose a fee. If an exchange goes bad it means they are insolvent. LN hub can't be insolvent. LN hub goes bad means they try to steal your money which you can prevent or they censor you which you can close your channel and just loose fee. Besides it is meant to be for small transactions. You would have open channels for small amounts.
"
"""I expect critics to nitpick"""
If I want to host a lightning network with a capacity of 1M users, each allowed to send $1000 worth of bitcoin each, how much money do I need hold in escrow? $1 billion dollars?
You're describing banks, credit cards, and Paypal. That you mention far far far less decentralized than in the case of fiat shows you have no idea what you're talking about. The analog isn't fiat, it's banks. And no, it is not more decentralized than banks. 
It is not a formal mathematical proof. Formal proofs involve axioms, references to mathematical properties, and other proofs then induces to a conclusion. It is good back of the envelope evidence. I have no problems with the evidence provided, it just isn't a formal mathematical proof.
"Where he talks about the money constraint problem I think he's being a bit pessimistic. According to him, the money supply will dry up regularly and be replenished by salaries, but I think it will more likely just shift around from one channel to another. Assuming decentralized routing works, I should expect my channel to receive from others I don't directly transact with as part of the routing. Hopefully it would receive about as much as it sends.

However the economics of LN still MASSIVELY favour centralised hubs and I hope I never have to use it."
"Incorrect. Spread more lies. 

> was able to find a payment route in about .5 seconds with a probability of 80 percent."
"> The main flaw with his analysis is he assumes it to be a solution for everyone and everything

The main flaw with your analysis of his analysis is you forget core is the ones forcing choking Bitcoin at 1MB blocks and forcing LN as the solution to everything since Bitcoin can no longer grow in ay meaningful way at 1MB blocks

the analysis is spot on if you account for cores malicious actions choking Bitcoin to force only/mostly off-chain (SW/LN) usage which is not even Bitcoin to begin with and is just like colored coins"
"Your point about use cases would be well taken if the LN promoters had picked a few (even one) use case and fleshed out a network topology and node funding that handled these use cases.  They haven't done this work. The LN designers and promoters have been repeatedly asked to do this work.  Without doing this work even if the LN could be made to scale for certain use cases it might actually be built out with other use cases in mind and therefore be perceived as a failure.  (That's making a generous assumption that the network would be built out without any evidence that it might work.)

I have concluded that the development talent behind LN is unlikely to ever succeed, because they haven't focused on what they are trying to do.  They have a five pound bag and are trying to fit ten pounds of stuff in it, so they had better figure out what stuff is important, or how to get a bigger bag."
Payment channel is a very old technology back from 1940s, mostly used by banks and financial institutions, the fact that this design was adopted by LN has already explained who is the sponsor behind this scheme
ok... so you want Bitcoin to be the same as fiat? Makes sense.
That's exactly the reason that Lightning can only be an *option*, not a replacement for Bitcoin transactions.  That's the reason the blockchain *must scale*.  It's right there in the open and obvious.
Learn how LN works.  It is possible for your channel partner to place a hold on your funds, and make you wait to receive them.
Consider bitcoin the foundation tech, and LN and exchanges as tech building on top of that foundation. Nothing stops you from using the foundation tech if that suits you. So sure, you can still be your own bank. Nobody is forcing you to use the LN, and if no user wants to use LN, that technology will die out on its own. 
Good thing segwit comes with an onchain capacity increase as well!
"Problem with bitcoin is more mining centralization, and i doubt anything will stop this other than a pow change.

Sure you can artificially limit it to 1mb but you're both fucking over the userbase and delaying the inevitable mining centralization."
Yes they are, both 2nd layers and commercial influence and mining centralizations are problems.
"+1 logic 

awarding you +1 logic for the questions you ask is worth the 10 minute cool down"
"It is a valid assumption to make **for the proof**.   

**For the same number of channels per user**, the  number of hops will be lower in a tree structure than in any other topology.  

In a tree structure, if each user has 11 channels (one ""up"" and 10 ""down"") and there are 10 million users, there will be about 9 million users in the fringe, and it will take about 7 hops to reach them from the root.  

If instead each user has channels to 11 **random**  users, it will take **more** than 7 hops to reach most users from any given user X.  That's because if you take all shortest paths from X to other users, they will form a tree with **less** than 11 channels per node, since many channels will  point sideways or backwards and will not help reaching anyone from X.  Then, in that tree, the average path length will be **greater** than the 7 hops of the hypothetical tree above."
"That assumption, as far as I can tell, decreases the amount of channels required.

It says that for every hop in the tree starting from node X and trying to find node Y, no hop from the tree connects to nodes already in the tree (which would be redundant and useless, since they'd only add a longer path than an existing one). If you don't make that simplifying assumption, as your tree (or rather, in this case, your graph) starts containing a non-trivial percentage of the network (which is the goal), then the effectiveness of an additional random channel or hop is decreased proportionally.

There is an issue with the argument but it has more to do with the idea that each user will open *n* channels randomly all at once and only then decide to try and route payments to others.

If instead you assume that a node opens a new channel whenever it cannot find a path to the recipient in less than X hops, until it reaches a maximum of *n* open channels, then the resulting graph will tend to have a much shorter expected/maximum path length

The problem with *that* counterargument is that's a very specific behaviour we're privileging, and while it does give you shorter paths than ""pick at random in advance"", it gives you longer paths than ""make at least one of your connections to the most central node in the graph"" once the number of distinct nodes you pay > number of channels you open, *especially* if everyone else follows that rule. The moment you introduce smartness in the selection process, you're likely to favour centralization.

This probabilistic analysis is a good starting point, but it makes it very obvious that what's actually needed is a simulation, due to the sheer complexity of the interactions between user strategies and hub strategies."
Their investors must be fucking furious at their incompetence. There is so much greenfield space for innovation you feel like you can just throw money at a blockchain startup. Maybe if blockstream spent any amount of effort whatsoever on building a product instead of manipulating public rhetoric, they would have a product to sell and generate revenue. But.. they didn't. They lost their CEO 6 months ago, their CTO has stepped in and is failing miserably. Their corporate management is an embarrassment to everyone who invested. Blockstream's funding is done, and bitcoin spring is about to bloom. 
"Segwit and Segwit2x - make no mistake its the same thing! Its been shoved down your throats and most of you have come to accept it. If you want a global currency revolution, you go with On-Chain scaling.

Segwit's main argument was that it would enable LN - there you have it. Proof of what many of us have long suspected.

Blockstream, and Barry Silbert have always known that LN was never ready. So why the tremendous push for Segwit???

Wanna know why'? Side-chains. Blockstream was funded on the condition they implement segwit to enable side-chains. This provides the key holders with the ability to create endless side-chains, and scaling through less secure chains, as well as diluting the scarcity of Bitcoin at the same time.

OKay, AXA funds Blockstream. Do you know who funds Barry Silbert's company? Mastercard. Yes, google it all you want.

Everyone here needs to wake up and realise that the Segwit is move by capitalist organisations to maintain their grip on the finance society.

If you are one of those people that has been compromised by the Segwit2x ""compromise"", just ask yourself why are you even agreeing to this? Core never committed themselves to a Blocksize increase, and everyone is suddenly ok with comitting to Segwit - in any form?

While DASH are happy to increase their blocksize, and Monero are happy to organically grow their blocksize, Bitcoin is to remain at a shitty 1MB cap just because certain powers say so?

The sooner we fork the better. Even if we have a minority chain - I believe the economic structure of Bitcoin's incentives will serve us right. Even if Segwit Bitcoin activates and has the initial market cap over Legacy Bitcoin, in no time at all, people will realise that they are waiting hours for confirmations, and paying big fees, when they can just use Legacy Bitcoin and do near instant transactions for near zero cost.

Its time to Fork.
"
The HF is included already. The miners are not the North Coreans. 
The best compromise is a chain split.
"> even if some of their code ends up being activated.

It's more complicated than that. Segwit is massive, it's not a few lines of code. "
"I love your optimism. I dearly hope you are right, and we won't meet another barrage of bullshit until activation of the HF and I hope we won't see miners suddenly bailing on the HF part.

I think this is essentially a game of poker. It appears to me like this:

**TPTB**: If you increase maxblocksize, we'll ensure with the control that we bought of the main communication channels and the developers that your fork will be driven into the ground. We do not want larger blocks, and if you dare do make them, we'll screw you over!

And now there's two answers to this, with two distinct results:

He's getting downvoted because you guys are literally trying to cheer each other up by  HOPING AND PRAYING the hardfork goes through after Segwit has become an irreversible, permanent part of bitcoin.
"> If you really thing there will be 2MB hard fork in few months, than you are dreaming.

If you really think there will be no hardfork in a few months, than you are dreaming. The miners are not the NorthCorean devs. The miners will not break the agreement. At least a majority of them. If some corrupt mining pools will stick with the North Coreans, great! That will ensure a hardfork and a chain split as well.

Or even better right now! 
"I dont think anyonw thought it was going to be completely peer to peer. Decentralized with centralized hubs was always how it was proposed. Still a ""centralized"" hub can't steal your bitcoin from you. And why wouldn't these large exhanges and other companies open payment hubs with all the thausands of bitcoin laying around? They might even be able to offer interest rate by sharing half the profit from the LN when you store btc with them."
"The SegWit2x hardfork will result in blocks that will grow to ~4.2MB in size, each containing a 4x to 5x capacity increase over the 1MB blocks we have today. 

While that's not an astounding leap in throughput, it should suffice for a few years while we continue our R&D efforts to discover a more viable and permanent *dynamic* solution to on-chain scaling.

None of the current alternative models (like ""EC"") are viable. We can do much better, and we *will* do much better with the extra time provided to us by SegWit2x."
"The Lightning Network and payment channels are great... FOR MICROPAYMENTS!  But this is only true the main chain has no transaction backlog and fees are low.  

If LN is your scaling solution, you have just created a centralized PoS banking cartel that loans the plebs bitcoin at interest because that's the only way they can afford to open and close a channel."
The good thing is that this discount policy is revertable by a hard fork

Fork off. "
quadruple downvote!  By the way, you're speaking to him directly.  No need to use the third person.
As I understand it the problem is one of scaling. When the popularity of the chain becomes significant, then the ability of the nodes to meaningfully keep up with the work load is determined by processing speed / storage. If the scaling of computers/storage is on par with the scaling of ethereum, then this whole argument is moot and falls on its face. 
"> I am very confident, that it is impossible to build another layer on top of the bitcoin blockchain, that allows for transactions with the same properties as the current Bitcoin transactions.

^^"
"Which is why the advice from everyone on both subs is always: *keep your coins in a wallet you control the private key of*, not on exchanges. But that does not remove the fact that exchanges play a vital role in the bitcoin ecosystem and that users will still want to make use of their services. 

MtGox went bad (something you of all people know a bit about) and people did switch to a number of other exchanges. Those who lost money on MtGox were users parking bitcoins there, or using MtGox to actively unload/load bitcoin into fiat. Has anyone ever checked how large the percentage was of users not actively trading and only parking bitcoin there out of ease?

Bitcoins underlying, low-level technology allows for trustless money. We can build on top of that foundation to create new use cases, and it is not strictly required to adhere to the same level of trustlessness. Exchanges are one example. Lightning Network will be another. If you don't want to accept the rules of a solution built on top of bitcoin, nothing stops you from using bitcoins foundation technology."
Simply means the hypertext transfer protocol belongs to no one. HTTPS could be seen as a layer 2 atop of HTTP for security benefits.
There is a place in bitcoin for the LN. It's well suited for doing arbitrage for stuff such as 0 conf, small transactions, repeat transactions, and tons of other stuff that's not possible with Bitcoin today. 
"The internet is rather decentralized, would you not say? You can talk to anyone on the internet, and your messages run all over the world without a single entity routing your traffic. Instead, that task is performed by a network of smaller routers, switches, bridges, and/or hubs.

LN is similar in that regard. It won't be a network of peers all interconnected without hubs or routers. What would be the problem of a company running a lightning network system with a bunch of routers keeping track of pathing.

That system will be just as trustworthy as an exchange. It is not a system suitable for all transactions; large sums of bitcoins can still be transported via the blockchain, and those who prefer to remain anonymous can choose to not use LN and opt for different solutions.

Another point is that running a lightning network does not require vast amounts of users. What if you want to set up your own network with family, some friends, your employer, your dog? Not a problem, as the routing problem does not exist there. You just started a service for all of your family and friends to pay each other instantly, securely, and anonymously."
"DNS is layer 2 atop TCP/IP; i.e set your DNS gateway to 8.8.8.8 and you'll get whatever Google says you should get. Nothing stops me from doing the same. Anyway, the point is, if a layer 2 tech becomes a bad actor, nothing stops someone else from stepping up and righting their wrongs. So long as layer 1 is truly decentralised then we are golden."
"Lightning is really good for companies like Coinbase and exchanges like Poloniex and Bitfinex. It allows them to use the LN to settle transactions between themselves when users send money between their exchanges. Basically, it's a cheap inter-bank settlement system. 99% of normal users wouldn't have much use for it, as people typically don't need to send money repeatedly to the same address over time. They want to send it to different addresses and users in the economy. LN is best for high-volume transactions between small numbers of centralized parties, which even in an decentralized economic system, do need to be established. 

Don't get me wrong, I agree with you too. I think it would be useful to them and I don't mind it being implemented. But exactly, it isn't the scaling savior. Optimizing block propagation to lower orphan rates is how bitcoin scales. Doing that raises the average size a block can be without getting orphaned; which is a natural market for limiting the blocksize. There should still be some protections in place (I particularly like the idea of a rolling average blocksize cap), but overall the natural market forces can limit the blocksize without needing a supply ceiling (the 1mb cap) which causes economic deadweight loss. "
"> A hub is, by definition, a point of centralization.

Yes, this is true. But we already have them in the space. They are called exchanges. There is no reason to believe that this will change, LN or no LN. "
"> The point he's making is that the funds are busy, not gone. 

Busy but available sounds good to me though. 

> There is no such thing as a decentralized hub

Hmmm, a airport also also called a hub. But you can avoid almost any hub you like. So....confusing definition...

What I mean specifically is a hub and spoke model, where hub A,B,C are all connected to each other. "
"It is not game over for Blockstream of any of their fans.

?? When I open a bank account to receive income, I don't need to deposit anything
"Sounds like he assumes funds are gone if funds are transferred on behalf of someone else. But in reality funds sent are funds which can also be received again. If I'm not mistaken. 

Furthermore, a distributed network can have leaves (clients which only have one channel open). The core of the network would still be distributed in such case. In other words: you can have distributed hubs which cater to most transactions. While not being centralised. 

I don't like starting with assumptions, I would rather simulate the network with employers, employees, merchants, utilities, leechers, hubs, rich/poor and then see if it can work. 

"
"Can you explain me how this should work? Without making me watch an 1 hour presentation?

Last time I had a talk with an expert about single funded payment channels we ended that it is the same like an onchain transaction, but worse ... 

A payment channel works by changing the balance. For example, both parties deposit 0.5 bitcoin. Than they do offchain transaction to change balances to 0.4:0.6. If you start the channel with 1.0:0.0, it only works in one direction."
I have no problems with fractional reserve banking. That's possible with or without segwit.
"lol. So you would have to have more money than exists in a system, to support transactions for everyone in the system? What kind of nonsense economic garbledy-gook is this? This seems like a radical departure... from sanity! Wait a minute, it's ""Bilderburg Economics"", I can sense it."
Exhanges are already doing it all the time. It will go wrong untill it goes right.
"The whole point of LN is that the intermediate nodes are trustless, and are not actually holding your funds.

However, to *receive* funds you need a node online, so many users are likely to contract that out to someone. That doesn't have to be a major hub, but since that would not be trustless, licensing requirements will probably restrict it to major players."
Yes, and they will only be able to become bank-like if users want them. Thats fine, as long as I can still always be my own bank.
">(Having said all that, I still like LN, it just won't be capable of standing in for the main chain, and Core shouldn't be crippling the main chain to pursue that fantasy) 

There's nothing wrong with LN the same way there's nothing wrong with large scale nuclear fusion power plants. It's just a technology.

The only thing that would be wrong is **pinning all our hopes and plans to it.**"
"it still ends in companies

"If Monero bothers you so much, you can discount that I even mentioned. The rest of the argument stacks up solidly. Segwit is a joke that is not needed under any circumstance.

Look at all the wonders its done for litecoin!

It's not a scalability solution. Case closed. The on-chain increase, is."
Miners and ASICs aren't the issue with bitcoin, like, at all. Get your head out of your ass, you're purposefully chewing the FUD they've spoon-fed you.
"I am not going to comment on the Blockstream ideas, but wanted your opinion, as we have discussed whether LN can work or not. 

This article suggests it cannot - and offers mathematical proof that it cannot. 

The authors draws the topological structure, as a distributed centralised network (with distributed hubs). He then does his mathematical analysis on a branched tree structure. Why is this the case?

Indeed at the start of the mathematical proof, the author states

> Modeling a theoretical network that does not actually exist, of a large group of diverse people, is obviously impossible to do precisely. We acknowledge making a number of assumptions, some stated, some implicit, and some generous to critics of this proof.

There are massive holes in the argument. The main one here

> To simplify the calculations, we will ignore the possibility that a branch on the tree could link to another branch already on the tree (such as an ancestor or cousin).

That is a ridiculous assumption to make in determining whether LN is possible. Surely you realise this?"
"> Unless they are feigning it and have some secret solution that would make them work; which I doubt.

Adam Back has been pumping the ""drivechain"" scheme lately."
"It's true it wasn't specifically ""Segwit"" they were thinking. But the funding was dependent on implementing Side-chains, which required a malleability fix to occur - hence segwit. Whether they backtracked later on is irrelevant... The funding already happened."
"When the cost closing of a LN channel exceeds the fee that needs to be paid for a transaction.

When SegWit activates you will see all the fud for what it is. Blocksize will increase to 2mb and scaling will continue. Schnorr is a much anticipated upgrade which will compress inputs to a single signature which is going to reduce the blockspace used allowing for more throughput for less. I mean dont think that on-chain scaling is standing still, thats just fud spread by the regulars on this sub.
"Hey /u/jonald_fyookball great work here.

If you want to *really* drive the nails into the coffin *and* stake the vampire's heart while you're at it, re-run your informal proof, only this time, make an assumption that hub capitalization follows global wealth distribution, with 1-3 players controlling ~~effectively all~~ 90-99% the channels.

You can take fees over Lightning. So don't you think some well-connected users with cheap bandwidth but expensive electricity (so that it won't make sense for them to mine) will see this as an opportunity?

I don't understand, what do you mean by that? I don't need any incentives to do this and I'm pretty sure (some) other people that have enough bitcoins to do the same also won't.
You get a tip every time someone transmits money via one of your channels (a mining fee, essentially, though it's not mining).
i think you're an extraordinary person. pretty sure i've seen your username before
I never met anybody who was willing to deposit money to receive money. When I tell anybody about this part of LN, the conversation about it usually ends and we go back to real things.
"While I have some doubts how well the lightning network would work, this guy's assumptions seem flawed. I wouldn't expect the channels to be evenly distributed among the participants, but rather everyone to have a few channels open only. There would be large hubs (this is how ""six degrees of separation"" works), but from my understanding this still doesn't mean that the hubs know who pays who.

Also, there's something odd with the calculations. At one point, he argues that ""the probability P for failing to choosing a member of a set |N| with cardinality n by sampling n times, with replacement is..."" In our situation, why would this be a suitable measure? Notably, why would a node pick the same path twice when probing for a path to a particular participant? It wouldn't. And the probability of ""failing to choosing... with**out** replacement is"" exactly 0. I think that something goes wrong with the argument here, in particular if you start taking limits in the next step. I didn't read the rest."
"> Ignoring the fact that nodes can loop back to other nodes means there's even LESS 'leaves' reached with the same number of channels... you'd need even more channels to reach the same probability as the simplification I'm making.

Why can't nodes loop forward, skipping several branches of the structure you outline?"
It's obvious that BS doesn't want more users, adoption, price growth... That's why it's evil.
"even worse

> To simplify the calculations, we will ignore the possibility that a branch on the tree could link to another branch already on the tree (such as an ancestor or cousin).

Which is the main assumption on which the LN will work is based. So the author is proving nothing at all, except that LN won't work if based on his own erroneous assumptions. 

"
">My guess is that Holders, not Traders and Users, are those who find PoS appealing.

Sure, holders would benefit the most. Which is also perfectly fine, because they are the economic majority. Users not as much, but still a little due to some ROI, and the ability to have some political influence via the consensus. As for traders, they at least wouldn't be worse off compared to PoW I suppose. That would mean a net gain with PoS I reckon, provided that security issues like the nothing-at-stake-problem were sufficiently addressed (e.g. with security deposits and vote-on-2-chains-proofs).

As for Lighnting, I agree it won't be feasible in a very decentralised manner."
"> Holders are the economic majority.

I don't know what you mean by that.  Indeed they hold the vast majority of the bitcoins, and they could cause the price to crash if they lost faith and stopped holding.  

But usually ""the economy"" means industry, trade, and consumption.  When a community does not have these things, one says that their economy is dead, even if they are holding millions of tokens of any kind.

 In the case of bitcoin, there is little consumption (loss of keys).  The miners could be considered ""the industry"". Trade would be the exchanging of bitcoin for money, goods, or services.  So the holders are not contributing to the economy...

> provided that security issues were sufficiently addressed

I do not know much about PoS, but it looks like that it would lead to concentration of mining *and possession*, much as happened to bitcoin."

"> I can't believe the company doesn't do a daily balancing of the books. And if they do, then there are gaping holes in their process.

From Coinbase's perspective though, the missing 200 000 USD are not missing at all and don't affect any of their balances because they simply cannot see that money (assuming that they're telling the truth). So at the end of the day their books are balanced."
The price of Bitcoin on May 30th was similar or lower than it is today. Still it would be nice to get the unblocked NOW and buy now before hitting the 3k.
"I'll quote the OP:

> It turns out my bank (BoA) did the transfer as an overnight ACH, which Coinbase does not support. The 'specialist' assigned to my ticket told me that my bank needed to recall the ACH transfer.

What does he mean by ""not support"" more specifically in the above quote? To me it sounds like Coinbase's bank does not support the ""overnight"" feature of ACH and is therefore not allowing access to the funds to Coinbase.

I think the same problem would happen if I have a Swedish bank account that can receive SEK and EUR but you send GBP to my BIC/IBAN. The money will leave your account, go through a few intermediary banks, and finally reach my bank. My bank will probably just refuse to accept the payment and not notify me as the receiver that an attempt has even been made. 

Then the money has to travel back again before you can see that they've returned. Sometimes this traveling back can get stuck and manual intervention is needed.

I've never tried to receive GBP to my bank account in Sweden that only supports SEK and EUR, so I'm just speculating on what would happen. But don't you think that something similar has happened to this Coinbase customer and that it may be so that Coinbase has not even been notified by their bank that an ACH ""overnight"" transaction has even been attempted?"
