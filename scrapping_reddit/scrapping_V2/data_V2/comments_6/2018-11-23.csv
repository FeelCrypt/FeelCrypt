"This isn't the Federal Reserve where some special people get access to the discount window and others don't.  Everything is public and voluntary.  It's an un-backed currency, not a security.  There are no ""insiders"" and there is no insider trading.

What part of that isn't clear?"
That illuminating moment when someone associates liberty with stupidity.  Charlie Lee is a sell out.  Crypto was never anything but a money making scheme for him.  Deal with it.
"So Elon Musk said the shares he had were worth more to boost their value and cause losses to others. He got nailed and could have been in more hot water. 

The guy in a responsible position said it was overvalued which inevitably leads to a decrease in price and sold first. His actions caused other people to lose money for his own gain from  a responsible position."
Thanks.  Yes it's very obvious what happened. 
"You're under the delusion that a figurehead should stay on as CEO indefinitely.  As an investor, if you believe in the project then you stay invested regardless...especially if you trust the concept of decentralized projects and ""community"". There are and will be scams as long as there are people who want great wealth without the tedium of doing research. Good book; ""The Book of Daniel Drew [Bouck White]"" an inside to stock trading written during the days when stock trading meant buying and selling livestock on Wall Street in NYC.
In spite of BTC being a decade old, this is a fledgling industry and a lot of people have yet to be hurt before it becomes mainstream."" Don't be one of them"" would be a good thing to keep in mind. I don't condone scams...I stay clear of them."
And what proof you have its a dead project?
Of course it's no conspiracy.  Your use of that word is duly noted, however.  We all usually get a 9.9% stake in our local banks in exchange for technical assitance.
"I would say what we're discussing is whether Charlie Lee was rightly blamed or not.

I disagree about your framing of how it went down, insofar as you argue that pro-BCH people criticized him for not selling and now we're bitching about him selling because it's a bear market. I think a more correct framing of the problem is that his actions as an individual completely contradicted his advice given as project creator, which is manipulation.

Correct me if I am wrong: You are now arguing that because it's a bear market now, Charlie Lee is being criticized for having bailed by selling off at a peak. You may have a point here, but really it's a small aspect of the criticism so I don't think this argument dispels the criticism of him overall. The rest of the problem remains (previous paragraph), and it is much larger than ""he sold off before the bear market!"""
"He was the lead developer of the project and actively pushed Armstrong to list Litecoin on Coinbase. 

Coinbase was the most downloaded app in the world during the peak of Litecoin. 

The fact that Charlie did all this work to get Litecoin listed on Coinbase and then sold all his holdings during the bull run speaks volumes.  

Coinbase should delist litecoin and refund investors who were scammed by this dead project. "
"but but but Charlie was ""dOiNg iT fOr lItEcOiN hOlDeRs"""
"Ultimately the real beef isn't that Charlie sold his stash or when, it was his conduct leading up to it. I at least feel he lied to investors and shilled hard on the SegWit hype (which did *nothing* for LTC really) for the sole purpose of enriching himself, along with some other shady stuff around the Litecoin Foundation and bogus payment processors that never materialized that were also hyped up. All around it was just shady, and his past affiliations with Blockstream and Bitcoin Core developers made him already untrustworthy. 

After the fact LTC went right back to being nothing with basically no real development drive, which is just further proof Charlie really didn't care about LTC or have any intention whatsoever of leading some new era for his project. He just lead a pump and dump and laughed all the way to the bank."
Crypto is to make money. Can't hate someone making money....
**Very true stories** get heavily upvoted 🤷‍♂️
"u/lyfeofbrian's comment should have more upvotes. 

Newcomers to this space are trying to adapt crypto into the old-world power hierarchy that they are familiar with. Leaders -> upper management -> workers (them) being told what to do without questioning. A lot of new users in crypto don't understand that central authority is an inherent weakness. They were told by others they could make a lot of money, they came here for that reason and they failed to learn what it's all about. This is also why we have pump and dump psychology based sell-off cycles rather than linear growth."
he can do whatever he wants, not here to judge
False.  *You* are now playing us vs them against BCH.  BCH isn't even mentioned here. This thread is simply reminding people of who sold out.
Of course not because they honestly acquired their money. If they dishonestly acquired it, it’s still their money, but people have a right to think they’re pieces of sh*t.

I don't. And I dont know if Litcoin posts are relevant to this sub, but I was specifically respinding to the guy who seemed to be saying that *only* Bitcoin Cash related posts belong here, which isnt true. "
Stupid lying post
Cool thanks for the info. Have a great weekend!
Well, Charlie was diligently HODL'ING up until that point. 🙂
A cult?
No matter what you can say about charlie, He's no Craig Wright. 
Vague. You're going to have to elaborate on that. 
He was the lead developer of the project.  There is good grounds for investors to sue both Coinbase and Charlie.   I am sure the SEC is looking into the matter.  
Thought this was standard with all coins. 
Those were his opinions. Lol, you are grasping at straws 
You should listen to someone with that sense of timing.
He said it was overvalued and in a bubble are previously pushing HODL. You tell me? Is there independent support for those two suggestions?
Nice.
Charlie didn't make anything up, did he? 
He technically could have but there was no private investment. He made it up.
Free market.  Freedom to identify the fake sell outs.
Of course Elon Musk has insider information
Neither did Elon Musk. He made it up to influence the market and later backtracked when he realised he fucked up. 
True, cryptocurrency is nothing like money printing.
"Again; Charlie did not have any insider information. It's as simple as that. "
I thought so too but you are throwing a wrench in that theory.
Unlike cryptocurrency, the German banking sector is highly regulated. Trying to stake in a bank without doing so in a Government regulated way is illegal. If you want you can actually search up information about this on the German government website. 
"Free market is a neoliberal construct that without justification looks to favour the wealthy in the hope that it trickles down to the poor. It was a newly popular (in the 70s/80s) construct influenced heavily by Friedrich Hayek.

Markets have always had regulation and rules and competition commissions to maintain competition and avoid monopolies/oligopoly. I studied this for my degree and the rhetoric is far removed from the actual theory behind markets and business environments."
Dont be sour because he played a better game than you
"Confused. I thought the current r/BTC claim was that only chain forks of BTC which use Sha 256 could claim to be BTC. You guys are including software forks now too?

"I don't even know where to start.

So I won't. Happy thanksgiving."
I’m curious to know if he has bought back in yet? 
"My problem with Charlie is not that he sold at the high. 

 My problem with Charlie is that he used his past position at Coinbase to convince Brain Armstrong to list Litcoin. Charlie only did this because  it became evident that Crypto was being hyped like crazy and Coinbase was the easiest place for uniformed investors to buy.  Charlie then sold after he realized how filthy rich he became. 

That is my problem with Charlie.   Brian Armstrong is just as much as fault. "
"I disagree, when you see whitepapers getting $100 Million in funding with zero product with an obvious parabolic arc a blowoff is not far behind. Anyone around from the Gox days like myself has seen this play out before. 

Regardless that doesn't excuse Charlie's behavior"
Yeah it's funny how all these people say it's obvious, but then are obviously not the millionaires they could be if they actually knew anything. It's like the drunk guy at the bar talking to the TV about their knowledge of the world
"Wow, don't talk into existence things that are not true.

&#x200B;

1. He was force to admit he was selling after the exchange was investigating the huge sell off.
2. He was selling on insider knowledge about litepay exit scam.
3. Then suddenly he is cheering nano."

"Losers

Cl is fine

Bch trolls suck"
Tbh I believe Ver cashed out a long while ago and this fork was just so they could get their coins back. They're business men, they're looking to make more money, does anyone seriously believe a people like him or CW want to make the world a better place?
And IIRC, right after he delivered those cautionary words, he said something about *LTC to da moon*.
yeah, I like the irony of all the places to post that.
"> In Charlie Lee's defense, he did say that he sold it all, that the price was not sustainable and that he expected it to go down.
> 
> So in that sense he was a great Shepard.

I mean, to correct history even further, I sold my LTC near $400, all of it. On coinbase the day of the peak I had sell orders at 392$ and on coinbase it peaked up and hit $401 and then flash crashed down to $370ish. But all my orders sold at $392

Charlie didn't sell his until a day or two later IIRC. Its hard to remember exactly but Im sure Im close. But what I do remember is that he sold AFTER the peak, not during the ""run up to"" it."
This is true. Except for misleading all those users into thinking he was holding when he was really using them to keep the price high so HE could sell. I think that’s the point of this post. You’re absolutely correct that making money is everyone’s right. But when you trick people— the very people who are helping you reach that wealth— then you’re a pretty dirty scumbag.
What he does with his money is his business, nobody else. 
Eventually.
"> that's like the captain of a damaged ship saying ""fuck all y'all, i'm taking the liferaft"" instead of patching holes, shouting orders, getting people moving.. ie, doing his damn job as a captain.

This is dumb as fuck. The crypto bubble brought down the ""ship"" not some fucking patchable holes. Every coin in the market has been patching holes since January, show me one that hasnt gone down with the market...

Some of you are simple as fuck man, lol. Take responsibility. The fucking creator even told those holders that the shit was not sustainable and to sell."

I remember he did an interview where he accidentally pumped LTC over 300%. It was like $60 at the time. I remember because I sold my stack at $90.  I did not see a reason for it to go to $300 or even $100.
Pepperidge Farm remembers.
He is not Charlie, doesn't matter if he hold it or not. 
Maybe he was hodling BTC instead.
"can you verify that he sold 100% and not 80% or 90% As I recall, he did mention he still owns Litecoins. 

Also, what did he do with it? Didn't he fund something?"
Yeah Mr goody goody two shoes Charlie Lee
"People angry at Charlie posts are getting old. I had to research for myself and I have a positive view of Charlie. He never sold at the top, but partially on the way there. He said several times it was a major bubble and that everyone should sell.  

Yet it's his fault people are down 90% lol"
You guys are pathetic at this point. Don’t you have internal wars to fight? Attacking others won’t make your centralized coin better
The second he announced that, smart LTC holders should have sold their entire holdings.
"Only a true idiot never sells or as they like to call it 'HODL'.

If you're expecting a crash of some kind and you can always expect a crash after a multi month long irrationally exuberant bullrun, then you dump it all and wait, even if you have to wait for a year, you just wait."
All the plebs that were praising him while he was dumping his bags on them. It was truly glorious
It is one of the best exit scams!
Don't disrespect, without LTC none of us would know how to multiply by 4
We have new enemies?
Why does this old story get 1145 upvotes? I don't see the relevance to anything current.
"Adding morals to crypto serves no point. 

Like this if Bitcoin hits $100k,should holders redistribute the wealth?"
"When was that? Over six months ago?

What was the question again? 

Want to try again?

The only reason this is being brought up now is because of the extreme bear market. If the bull market continued and LTC was 1k *do you think this would still be brought up?*.

Not 6 months ago, Now."
He did what he saw fit, and I applaud him for it.
His actions remind me of the film Margin Call.
What??? First I’ve heard of this he is still running Litecoin??
"What conflict of interest? That doesn't make any sense at all. 

""Hi, I'm Bill Gates, I founded this small software shop, Microsoft, I believe it's going to be biggest software company, so I am going to sell all my shares, so I won't have a conflict of interest.""

Nope, nonsense."
Any project, be it crypto or business, where the lead developing owner sells all his ownership at the peak is inevitably a dead project.   
"Who cares?

Yeah, Lee was always just a cash grabber, and Litecoin was the very first cash grab fork, that added literally nothing compared to Bitcoin. It didn't innovate, didn't expand, didn't improve, it just sped up and copied the original. 

I mean, congratulations to him, he's rich now off creating the very first pointless shitcoin. Well played. 

I don't care, though. It has no bearing on cryptocurrencies as a whole. "

You seems threatened

No it wasnt fucking obvious. You say this aftermath, but at the time nobody knew where the top is. Everybody knew it was maniac but it kept breaking the record every time someone made a top prediction. LTC might have gone $2000 and Charlie could have been criticized less. If the mania phase was over when ETH was at $8, Vitalik could have been claimed part of the pump-and-dump scheme. 
Like i said everybody knew the market was unsustainable but nobody could correctly tell when the maniac phase was gonna end. Because if you did someone could have shorted the hell of it and became a billionaire. But in reality, anyone who shorted along the irrational bull run got rekt. So my point is the timing Charlie had chosen to sell is *not* something “that could have been seen from a hundred miles”. Of course, Charlie was damn lucky to have timed it right, but salty bagholders are going to be salty, and their sentiment is completely understandable.
