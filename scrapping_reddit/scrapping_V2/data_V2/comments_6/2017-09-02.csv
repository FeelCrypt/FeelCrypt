Does this bot monitor only /r/bitcoin or every subreddit?
Still didn't address the fud about segwit addresses being insecure. Will not respond again until you address this.

Emphasis mine.
Breaking reddit is further defined as:

Don't break the site or do anything that interferes with normal use of the site.


The ones we can't seem to get admins like /u/bluepinkblack, /u/bsimpson, or /u/spladug to address."

Right now only bitcoin, as it is the heavily controlled sub.  Next week we'll be adding /r/btc by popular demand(not sure why with public mod logs) and other subs as requests/time allows.  There are limits to how many subs one bot can handle though.
"Thanks. I think that ideally there should be a bot that monitors *all* subreddits and not just a few (including /r/btc). It's good to be notified always because even with open mod logs it's easy to miss. 

If I subscribe to your bot censorship notification messages now, will I automatically be added to all future subreddits that get added? I'd like that."
"Yes, once subscribed the bot won't differentiate.

While it would be great to watch all subreddits, the process is very request heavy.  The more users, posts, comments, subs being watched, the longer the delays before the bot can detects something amiss (reddit limits requests).

Once we open source this, people can run them for subreddits as they desire.  Few weeks out for that, but we'll get there."
Every honest subreddit should advertise such a bot in their sidebar in my opinion. Thanks, I've subscribed to your bot's notification messages.
No they can't provide *unbiased* articles because there is no such thing as information without bias. Except perhaps empiric data, which can still easily contain bias.
