Shouldnt it just hit the highest bid? This seems like really poor system design from btcmarkets
"No? Then shut up.

Tell him to bring 🍺 Freedom Ranger 🍺 back. Everyone keeps saying it was so good, but I never got to try it. 
Do limit orders show up in the order book? So the lesson is to check the depth of the order book? If there aren't enough fillable orders at acceptable prices, don't place the order?
Stop loss: For when human panic selling low is not enough and you want a robot to really ruin you.
because if my aunt had balls she'd be my uncle
"He didn't specify amount. Just ""bought BTC"" which is true 😊"
You can see it on their exchange website as well.  But it does sound like an error, the order book does not appear thin enough for the volume associated with the dump to be accurate.
"Lmao. You do realize that the majority of old timers from 2011-2015 who are still active on reddit are here on r/btc..

You're right though, thin orderbook."
"No, if you set limit sells under the current price on most markets, it matches the highest orders first, because doing anything else is stupid

&nbsp;

A few exchanges don't do this - and they shouldn't be used"
that's not how a market order works
No... it places your order at the specified rate.
Don’t place limit orders if you don’t know what you’re doing.  If people want their hand held, they shouldn’t be trading.
But you get a warning if the price of your offer deviates too much from the current price, afaik.
Yes it would! And that is the goal behind bitcoin cash...adoption! Many bitcoiners proclaim the motto of HODL, where Cash proponents are all “Spend!”
This is Blockfolio. 
Nice. Do they accept BCH?
Danville? I’m friends with their brewer!
This is so sad in a way, if I ever write such a big price I'd count every digit twice to make sure. Or he is a time traveller or just careless.
LOL
BTC markets is one of the biggest exchanges in Australia. That doesn’t make it big, but big enough that this is an anomaly. 
Btcmarkets
This is Australian dollars, not USD.
Who knows, with the way these markets are going this could be all of us soon 😂 i will finally be a bitcoin whale!! My sell walls will be legendary
Hehehe for sure
Bags not trying that...
"On any respectable trading system, you'll get a warning if your outside the bid-ask spread, and then even if you confirm and execute, you'll still be matched against the highest bid / lowest ask.  

If a system you're trading on does not do that - you should not trust it with any real amount of money."
It is a shit  exchange! Sucks we have few options  in Aust
Depends how large the sale was and he wiped out all of the Buy Orders in the books. I'm not familiar with that exchange and/or their order book depth.
"Must disagree. Old timer here from 2010. Only fools, noObs and 14 year olds hang on this sub. At least that's how you all sound. I come here every once in a while to hear the shilling and keep an eye on all sides but that it.
Please post a reply if you've been into Bitcoin since 2011 and are into BCH. "
That’s neat but now that I think about it, transferring bitcoin into fiat isn’t all that fun. The real joy would be getting paid in bitcoins and then paying others in bitcoins and never having to deal with fiat. 
Dead cat bounces happen, thats the point. If BTC hits 1000 so quickly that you didn't have time to get to your computer and manually check it out, I promise you it will rise back up. Yes of course, if your using Gemini this won't happen. But calling someone a noob for having a stop loss and getting caught in a $999 sell, and then claiming that you would have a stop loss at $1000 is not only hilariously ironic but very stupid.
There are bitcoin ATM which allow a person to withdraw fiat. They don’t hold your bitcoin for you though. You send BTC (or BCH) to the provided address and based on the exchange rate, receive dollars, just like an atm pulls money from your bank.
LOL what? What does bitconnect's dead cat bounce have anything to do with anything here?
It would be cool if some company could hold the bitcoin for us and then when we want to pay fiat currency for something just give us an instant fiat loan and take their money’s worth out of our deposited bitcoins. That way we could spend it wherever fiat is accepted. 
"Even bitconnect coin fought a little on its way down by ticking back up a few times and didn't hit (essentially) 0  immediately.  It's not a good idea to automate that sort of thing as you will likely lose money.
"
Makes total sense to show up, or else the affected person might figure it out
"I’m interested in the tech, and the philosophy. I don’t use bitcoin for very much...yet. I’m guessing some cryptocurrency will hit the mainstream in the next few years, and bitcoin cash has the best chances IMO. My brother had a “the future is here” moment when he accidentally found himself at Lowe’s without his wallet. He was able to use BTC to buy a Lowe’s gift card online with his phone and immediately buy his stuff.  
I have a small business, and if I can convince one of my customers (local brewers) to pay in bitcoin, I would use it more than I currently do."
"Yeah. If i traded on some obscure low volume exchange

Edit: wait, no, youre totally wrong. This guy had to have fat fingered his sell order or the trading engine totally fucked up"
We solved the mystery! We did it Reddit!
"LOL the point of a stop loss that low is that i wouldnt be caught with my pants down if there was an actual security issue with bitcoin. There is only one way bitcoin is going to go below 1000 and thats if its going to 0.

And no, i wont get flash crashed. I use gemini. They cant pull shit like coinbase can. If you dont understand why, look into how trusts operate. I wont bother writing past that."
It would match yes, but the order would be executed at the value stipulated by the seller. What you would see in the charts, would be an insanely low shadow of the session candle stick. The candle would still close at a high value. The engine would not execute Stop limit order in the middle.
Then it wouldn't show up publicly like op's image.
"Ah well funnily enough I happened to refresh /r/new right when this post came up and I responded to the OP about his username without paying much attention to the conversation he was starting. 
 
My friends and I played around with bitcoins when they were cheap. I last bought a bitcoin when they were about $US $100 to buy, but after sending a few friends it a few times, they just sent it back and really there wasn’t anything to buy with it so they all deleted the app and I ended up donating the last of it to something online a few years ago so I could free up some space on my phone. 
 
I did sign up for Apple Pay not long ago. It reminded me of bitcoin, except even easier than snapping the blocky square, you just zap the money over the airwaves. But then again, Apple Pay is just for in person transactions, whereas bitcoin can pay someone on the other side of the world just as fast as it could pay someone right here in Danville. 
 
Do you think bitcoin is catching on as a viable way to buy stuff in Kentucky now? Is it worth reinstalling breadwallet?"
Hahaha I was about to say you can't tell how nooby someone is just from their stop loss but you proved me wrong.
[removed]
I think you just completely missed the point. What is the point of having a stop loss that low? The chances of it dropping and staying that low in a day are pretty much zero. You would be the noob who is liquidated on one of those crazy dips. Go do some research on how to use stop losses.
"Lol k. Doesn't change that it's a fact. This has been checked in the reddit archive data.

Also, you sound like an idiot."
I'm pretty sure it will match the highest bids first. You'd need a monstrously sized order to go down that much.
yes, but not in this context. look at the chart. the entire daily volume was small and the period's volume was smaller than other periods.  this is just a really shitty exchange
What if they do that and cash the difference?
/s /j /w
I’ll pass it on. I don’t know how much of his time is spent at Monnik vs The Beer Engine. I’m up in Georgetown. Have you seen any other KY bitcoiners here?
Lol you can tell how much of a noob someone is with how high a stop loss they put, i dont use stop losses but if i did it would be like 1000/btc
"Particularly when the price crashes through your stop loss so fast it doesn't trigger and the exchange is just like ""whatever""....and you panic even harder."
bitfinex allows bellow market value sells.
That's literally how market orders work. Nothing shitty about it. Just stupid people. Bots remove their orders as market sells are made onto bids, it happens on every exchange. Just don't use market orders if you can't see the real-time order book.
I’d post it on r/bitcoin but the fuckhead admins over there banned me back in October. 
And the volume was quite high so yeah, I would avoid this exchange...
Next week he will probably be happy about have gotten 999$ for his Bitcoins :(
Maybe in a year we will all be stoked at a price of $999..
Oof
I think if he waits 1 more month, then it'll seem like he made out like a bandit.
[removed]
Probably the Mt Gox trustee again....we all know that guy makes good choices. 
I literally saw that  happen! Felt bad for that person:/ 
Why is that even possible on a healthy exchange platform?
Does the exchange margin lending? If so, this looks like a cascading stop loss when the orderbook liquidity was very low.
some can afford to do so
Hey we have a little brewery in my town called The Beer Engine. 
There is a chance that he probably did it intentionally and sold some to family or a friend for cheap instead of just giving it to them for free. That way he pays less fees than if he would have sent them to them as a transaction. He also probably can claim them as a loss in his tax report, not sure on that one though.
than that is one very shitty trading platform
Any barely decently written exchange would prevent this to happen. Shame
Must have been a typo. Lucky for whoever bought those Bitcoin.
Don't worry. He was just planning a month ahead.
Time traveller from next week?
That had to have been coordinated on a small exchange or something 
Ahh this is why were at 7k
What exchange is that on?
Good thing it wasn't for $9.99.
This is an error I believe as none of my orders were matched
That must be a shitty exchange, you can put a $1 sell at wex and it will just dump to the current highest bidder(s).
Some lucky fuck just bought btc for $999
BTC markets sells at highest bid if you input a value lower than current ask. Idk how this is possible. I use btcmarkets a fair bit.
What app are you using to view btcmarkets bro? Doesn't look like it's website.
 Purple more weeks and 999 May be a good price.

it must be the bitcointrash people trying to lower the price!!!1^/s
bitcoin.de is working as a marketplace too - you can accept any offer at any price
too much stoned
But doesn't a limit buy order usually take the lowest sell price? 
"> poor

yes, now he is"
I feel shitty for sap here, but I am also a ****ing cunt. I would drop a buy order for something asshat as $9.99 if I could and leave the buy order open. Just see if I could catch some poor sap. Only if I could though to see if I could catch people out hard.
poor bastard. I feel like a total failure, but FOR him, Nothing to do with me, but my damn reaction.
They're planning on buying back in when it hits $1
Probably just a misprint. You’ll see these all the time in stock markets. 
[deleted]
no, if you sell below market value.
Fuck all you bcashers are noobs . Someone will have done a massive market sell and the order books are thin . Sell your bcash and read some books ...
Also, some lucky bastard just bought some BTC for $999.
Some other lucky bastard just bought btc for $999 in 2018.
Could be an error in their reporting to Blockfolio. 
I think the data is corrupt. I have bids in the market all the way down to 5k, and none  were hit.
How do you know it was 1 btc and not 0.00000001 BTC
Probably thought he was selling his bitcoin cash
😂😂😂
