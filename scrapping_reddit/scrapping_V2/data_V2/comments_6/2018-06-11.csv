I won't tell you any argument. Do your own research not listen to me or those fucking idiots.
"lol what a convenient non answer from a butthurt shitcoin holder

""Judge, I won't give you my defence, go research it on your own""

I'm not buying that and neither is anyone else

You calling them idiots just proves you know nothing, because ad hominems are used when a person lacks actual arguments in a discussion."

Do you think looking at github commit records is a good way of determining ""who controls Bitcoin""?  Don't you think it's possible for anyone on the Core team to commit someone else's code? Furthermore, I know for a fact that Wladimir often gets credit for a commit because he's the repo maintainer. However, chances are very high that he's just MERGING code someone else wrote on another branch \- he didn't write the code.

What's much more important to answering the question of ""who controls Bitcoin?"" is understanding who the opinion leaders are in the dev team and the community at large.  Since 2015, the number one most influential coder and author of Bitcoin Core's roadmap and Segwit is Greg Maxwell. Also, he has been the most outspoken on scaling issues and technical discussions as a whole. He also was CTO of Blockstream until recently. You can't just ignore this connection and claim that Blockstream, Core, and BTC development are not closely linked.

The final and most important piece of Blockstream's domination was provided by Samson Mao last week. He said ""of course we're not going to keep developing everything for free""... Blockstream is a for\-profit corporations which is heavily influencing BTC development and roadmap, and their profit model is dependent on the BTC chain retaining a small blocksize. This is an overt conflict of interest and it's horrible for the outlook of the BTC chain."
"I lost you at “extreme right wingers and Russians.”

At least try to keep a comment about being skeptical of the media unbiased."
When you send BCH to somebody, do you broadcast the transaction yourself, or do you rely on an SPV node to do it for you ? Does the SPV node require a license ? It's doing the same job as a Lightning node, right ? So by your logic the people running it should have a money transmitting license too.
Glad blockstream is sponsoring sites like [this](https://satoshis.place/) with their off chain solutions. They are so mean.
"Sure is a good thing we didn't listen to Mike Hearn and therefore Bitcoin didn't pour half its value into altcoins then fork into various forms. You're sure right about that. That Mike guy would have split the network, good thing we didn't listen to him.  One Bitcoin, United. Rah rah.

I read about some double spend issue on bch
finally a new video I can share to friends who don't see anything but the surface of this war and still believes in LN.
">2.) An artificial cap on blocksize that reduces on chain throughput, changing the original structure of Bitcoin but maintaining all its original use cases/intentions while remaining totally decentralized and unstoppable.

How are LN hubs decentralized? You're just giving control to the banks. Bcore loves centralization."
Nodes in a bitcoin network don't provide liquidity, they just pass along a bit of data
