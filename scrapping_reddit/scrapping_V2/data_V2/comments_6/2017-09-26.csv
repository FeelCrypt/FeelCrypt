"That is messy and requires universal adoption. For contentious changes, universal adoption will fail and thus this code would cause the network to fork.

This is different from the soft-forking mechanism which Satoshi used a number of times himself (apparently) which does not require universal adoption to successfully be deployed.

(edit: Also, gimme a break. I have hundreds of notes in my inbox. It takes me this long to get to them all. I don't have the kind of time you people do.)

Cool story bro. 
"> Dude, what's with you and replying to month old threads? It's almost as if you wait until no one is going to see it to avoid getting called out or avoiding downvotes. This is like the 4th or 5th time I've seen you do this with me specifically.

I don't look at my inbox for a couple months at a go. So sue me.

> [blah blah blah] Where did I claim that? Projection much?

Apparently you didn't, indeed. I'm happy to admit I was wrong. You're still a troll.

"It was not *introduced by Hal.* Hal asserted it was necessary. Satoshi relented and agreed that it was a good idea.

Your own link states: ""The 1MB limit was there by the time Bitcoin launched.""
"
I'm not sure why you even bother replying especially after so long. You've added nothing to the argument. 
"> 1MB limit wasn't added until mid 2010

.. *by Satoshi*.

> See you in another month!

Hi. It's been 3 months. Whew. Only 5 more messages to go.

And—anyone with a brain can see that it was intended to be a semi-permanent, or difficult-to-change fixture, or else the fact that the design was ""set in stone"" would have instead been a civilized blocksize increase that didn't require a hard fork.

My opinion is that consideration of data storage capacity and bandwidth restraints are diminishing moderately, across the board, in general.  The hardware factor I have more interest in is electricity usage.  I wonder if Bitcoin can ever be efficient.
It's called marketing. I want others to know there is a superior implementation of Bitcoin that exists. And of course I want the value of my holdings to go up. By the way, if you held any bitcoins before August 1st, 2017, the value of your Bitcoin Cash coins will go up. Only a shill wouldn't want that.
"What do you mean the value of my bch will go up? Is that just your price expectation stated as a fact? I personally sold all my bch just above $750 so I'm quite happy. 

As for that this is marketing, I think it's poor marketing to run an attack based campaign and not one based on the merits of your product by itself. It comes off as though you don't have enough confidence in your protocol to have anything to say other than that bitcoin is crap. "
"I'm confused, didn't that early version of the LN name-specific paper only come out in like feb of 2015? 

I'm curious too now about who specifically promised it ready in 2015.

I think there was a lot of loss of potential developers due to asicboost and resistance to segwit over-politicized, despite it being an obvious and harmless upgrade. there's still a lot in btc, but could've been so much more. but theymos idiotic censorship only made it far worse than it should've been. we all got really anti whatever theymos was pitching back then as a response to that censorship, including myself. it took years after leaving subreddits for info we couldn't trust to understand the rationality of core points, thankfully the devs were posting in this sub at least."
Adam Back from BlockStream was mostly pushing it as a solution saying April, it was before any whitepaper had even launched.  But he says trust me trust me, I invented hashcash, and btc is hashcash extended with inflation control.  And everyone falls in line onto the slaughter house.

Misleading title.
They don't accept BCC. This is just the wallet.
For some odd reason I don't want to click that link.
BTCPay has no FIAT banking, which is the only thing that makes Bitpay so useful to merchants. It is pretty much useless like that. Might as well use services that exist already: https://rocketr.net/
oh hey it's you again
What do you mean? OP showed they just made a wallet for bitcoin
btcpay will go bunk along the minority chain with not replay protection. I wouldn't touch that with a ten feet pole if I were you. 
I see. We still need their flagship that is merchant acceptance in the meantime - everything else is just cherry on the cake. 
It sure is, these might look like minor events but they are probably just getting everything in order to eventually allow merchants to accept BCH. Also, Bitstamp should have BCH trading pairs ready any day now. Having trusted exchanges like that providing liquidity for BCH trading will surely increases the odds of Bitpay accepting BCH.
"Guessed it wouldn't be that easy.
"
They only deal with BTC and we were able to load the visa through BTC. Bitpay adding BCH tells me they are adding the same service for bitcoin Cash. There business makes more sense using BCH. 
Plus, how you load the Visa card is THROUGH the wallet.

"> BTCPay has no FIAT banking,

The idea is you use an API and connect it to any exchange your prefer for the fiat side.

bitusher's way of saying that Bitpay will stick with NYA
"Yes. But this is still great news.

https://acceptbitcoin.cash/ is a good place to start."
"Oh, now you expect me to click THOSE links. LOL.

Interesting...
"Bitcoin is what is referenced in the whitepaper.

It is a peer to peer, decentralized, electronic cash.

Bitcoin is best represented today by Bitcoin Cash.

The legacy-bitcoin already forked itself away from Bitcoin."
I haven’t received my card yet so I can’t 100% confirm. But if they accept BCH I can’t imagine not being able to load my visa through BCH. 
You can’t load your Visa card through your bch wallet? Can someone confirm this? I’m skeptical. 
"I think it's needed the address converter to be used separately https://bitpay.github.io/address-translator/
Too much friction to me at the moment."
Saw the screenshot and thought Amazon was accepting it
"Can I load my bitpay card with btc Cash now?   

Checks....no..:("
"Is anyone able to send to their Bitpay Bitcoin Cash wallet? Bitpay wallet BCH addresses begin with ""C"". My mobile wallet doesn't seem to like the address. "
Bitpay is being forked since they plan on leaving bitcoin. Test this - https://btcpay-server-testnet.azurewebsites.net/
Does this mean all places I've bought with Bitcoin via BitPay in the past now also accept Bitcoin Cash?
Okay, so is there an easy way to import private keys into BitPay's wallet?
Yes!
"Interesting, however addresses start with a ""C"". How to get funds *into* this wallet?"
"Luke's.
