Hashpower is a lagging indicator, not a leading one. Mining profitability is the leading indicator. If the BCH price gets high enough and the difficulty low enough, miners will flock to BCH. I can imagine also that the two chains will reach an echilibrium with miners moving back and forth between the 2 chains considering the profitability.

Yeah I'm mad about little bitch shills for Witcoin being apologists for scammers and censors like that motherfucker Theymos.
zip it, retard
"Asking you for some sort of proof doesn't mean I'm apologizing for anyone.  Do you really not understand that?

I didn't build this account for 3+ years, making no posts at all in any digital currency post, just so that one day, I could come shill for some guy I don't know.

I saw your post on all and was like, ""Hey, what's this about?""  I see a bunch of claims with nothing backing them up except an angry little kid.  If that makes me an apologist, I hope you figure things out for yourself soon because no one deserves to be as angry and jaded as you seem to be."
"> I respect your opinion, however I really doubt Bitcoin would have made it to where it is today without the strong bitcointalk community that formed early on

You do realize that Theymos didn't build Bitcointalk, right?  It was handed to him after going through several other people who were vanishing to try to remain anonymous and not be tracked by the government."

I am aware. I've had several conversations with him. While he didn't build it, I do feel that he had a big role in keeping the community running and taking care of administrative tasks for years. If he hadn't done those things maybe someone else would have stepped up, maybe not - like you said, a lot of the early organizers were trying to stay anonymous.
I don't believe you for a second. Stop playing dumb, or get a fucking clue. You appear to be just shilling for a thief. Maybe you are just a butthurt alt account of that thief.
Alright man.  Good luck with the... whatever you have going on.

I've read this already. Can you please quote the part that is evidence theymos is *under the influence* of Blockstream? 
So many childish insults and so little argument. You need a timeout. 
"If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck..

"Oh, you're one of those who think we blindly suck Roger's dick. We don't, to me he's just some guy who mods here and operates a minority Bitcoin pool. At least he doesn't condone or support removing controversial subjects. 

It isn't propaganda *when it is true and factual*. I was actually around for everything that happened in Singularity's post and saw it happen with my own eyes. 

You're projecting how ignorant you are, and that you support /r/bitcoin in deleting posts and censoring comments that disagree with Blockstream.

"> If this sub and it's users actually did something to progress crypto maybe you guys would actually be taken seriously

Without this sub, Bitcoin Cash would not have been possible. Get outta here with your bullshit."
Irrefutable logic... /s
"and Ethereum, Litecoin, Dash,  dogecoin, ripple, monero...etc

This wasn't a BCH only announcement, but an ""All Stable Crypto"" announcement."
Did you already dump all your Bitcoin Cash? If not, I'm buying.
The people kept hostage by full blocks learn to love them despite not being backed by reason?
Bitcoin doesn't have feelings.
Lol about the Stockholm Syndrome comment. That's exactly what so many people are going through as they submit to Blockstreams abuse. I'm glad you're at least aware of your predicament. Perhaps you will join the rebellion when you start caring about the world's economic future. Until then, enjoy the wealth. You won't be receiving money from me in the near future. 
"> Edit: also, have you heard of Stockholm Syndrome?

Remember, you are stating this into a mirror. If you question someone else in this way, you need to question yourself as well.

You know for a fact that r/bitcoin is an echo chamber, you just feel it is justified. Justified or not(in your mind) it is still an echo chamber.

Free your mind."
Can you explain how Stockholm syndrome is related to this discussion?
I guess Overstock will accumulate Bitcoin Cash. 
f em
same here
He announced he planned to dump it all immediately.  I assume he did.
Did you sell all your BTC?
Number 5.... Is alive.... 
I thought he was humorously suggesting that he himself may actually be spending more time over at r/bitcoin due to his self experiencing Stockholm Syndrome.
"If I'm not mistaken as a Bitcoin Cash user you'll have to pay a fee for both Bitcoin Cash transaction and a fee that will help them to receive what you've paid, but in Bitcoins. Thanks to Shapeshift.

In other words: I think they want to convert all alt-coins to bitcoin, but you pay the conversion fee anyway."
Overstock won't touch cash at all, they'll only get bitcoin.
That makes no sense.
"I think it makes sense to hold on both chains atleast until SegWit2x HF activation. 

Whatever Eric does with his money is not our business.

"
That's the way that I interpreted it (though I don't know too much about the guy, and if I did it might change my interpretation).
Possible, but unlikely. I hope you are right.
If it's like bitpay, shapeshift will pay them fiat for the BTC.
Ohh, you mean '$2 fee slow settlement layer coin with troll devs'. Sign me up for some of that. 
For example, I want larger blocks, but I don't want the confusion and community split from the BCH fork. People can have different opinions from you you know.
https://shapeshift.io/#/coins only crypto.
You realize there will always be confusion and community split with any fork when you have propagandists like segwit controlling all discourse online and it not being in their financial interests to have a fork to bigger blocks.
Overstock isn't gonna sit on crypto. They're gonna exchange it asap for fiat. I understand how shapeshift works.
"They may still decide to hodl something.

https://www.coindesk.com/ostk-hodl-overstock-keep-50-bitcoin-payments-investments/

But perhaps for *political reasons* they won't hodl both bitcoins."
Yeah definitely just BTC. This is surprising for a company of that size (but I may be overestimating the size of the company) I'm wondering how that will work out long term if they go bankrupt/downsize.
Bitcoin Cash aligns with your principles, or what I thought were your principles. Are friends and politics that addicting to cave into at the level of success you've achieved? Your participation in the other sub and your antagonism to being even mildly happy that Bitcoin Cash happened baffle me.
I am sure he would genuine like to do that, but ShapeShift cannot afford to split away from the Bitcoin network. You know, a huge majority (97%+) of the SegWitCoin nodes will not hard fork to SegWit2X.
You can want big blocks and not want a fork like BCH.
"> notice how more and more businesses are beginning to accept BitcoinCash.

Lol, this announcement is that Overstock now takes any altcoin because they integrated with shapeshift.

But it doesn't surprise me that you misunderstand this.  That seems to be a common theme with you.

And you're back on changetip?  You're still celebrating centralized trusted third party services?  Just wait until bitcoin gets a decentralized trustless changetip bot using LN.

Also, if you're going to call me out, at least get my username right."
Good vibe!
"I'm not paying Bitcoin Core fees, Shapeshift fees, and Bitcoin Cash fees, all to buy Bitcoin Core for Overstock.

I'll use my visa..."
"Duuude.  Overstock.com.  Always great when people in power ""get it""."
"Erik, come November, will Shapeshift accept 2mb blocks on Bitcoin?

Just curious where you stand.
"
Doh! 404! These are not the droids you are looking for!
Would it be a good idea to have payment channels with bitpay?
Technically any altcoin could be used?
It would make way more sense the other way around. Customers would safe enormous fees by having Bitcoin Cash the actual target currency.
To the moon!

"notice how more and more businesses are beginning to accept BitcoinCash.  changetip, LROS, and now OSTK.  and i'm missing some others.  that's b/c fees will be predictably and stably low; which is exactly what Bitcoin biz has been missing for the last couple of years b/c of Bcore high fee policy meant to drive tx's to offchain solns.  except these solns don't exist except in a bunch of lunatics minds, like this /u/gizram paid shill."
Erik feel free to actually participate in conversations here in this sub as opposed to going to the censored sub where many thousands of us cannot participate even if we wanted to. 
The problem is that you will have to pay huge Bitcoin fees even if fees in Bitcoin Cash are really low
"Boah Erik!  You dumped your Bitcoin Cash too early! 

**Bitcoin**  - A Peer-to-Peer Electronic **Cash** Systemâ€œ"
"Sometimes I do ;)

Edit: also, have you heard of Stockholm Syndrome? "
"ChangeTip went out of business a long time ago and well before Bitcoin Cash was a thing. If you or others have been sending Bitcoin Cash, (or any crypto) to ChangeTip, I suggest you stop doing that. It's likely lots of defunct businesses will accept Bitcoin Cash but this is not noteworthy.

ChangeTip may still allow withdrawals of Bitcoin if you still have some on their site. If so, it might then be possible to split that Bitcoin into Bitcoin Cash."

"We live in a monogamy world. Two timing is frowned upon.

Edit: Aye, 'tis but a joke about *business engagement*.

I'm not, however, supporting segcoin in any way, because the way ""developers"" who deliver it and strong-arm others into accepting it, completely violate everything bitcoin stands for."
they accept an altcoin wow.
"We can restart the whole merchant acceptance thing again. 

Whats really needed is a market place for goods or services restricted only to bitcoin/crypto in order to overcome greshams law."
I think that the fact that Bitcoin Cash is considered a stable crypto is an achievement on its own.
Good point.
Since the integration is done on the service's side, it makes sense for them to receive BitcoinCash instead I guess. Do they have this option?
Yes that's absolutely true. I think this is a problem without an easy solution, so 2nd layer solutions are definitely worth discussing / testing. Or maybe we'll find something else solving this problem.
But high fees means we lose out on a big chunk of usage. We don't want people to hoard money. We want them to spend it!
