"> /r/bitcoin is moderated to only write about the chain with the most proof of work.

Lot's of discussion about future development of bitcoin and scaling options has been extensively ""moderated""."
You best be trolling, because if you don't know about the censorship that's been going on on r/bitcoin then why are you even talking on the subject as if you know anything about it. Fucking ridiculous.
*Heavily moderated*. Good point though, thank you.

"""Think for yourself"", he said after smashing the like button on a Richard Heart ""thought leader"" podcast."
Right, sorry for the confusion but I was talking about the response in the link. The 'ðŸ¤¯' is just an empty square for me. It actually looks like it may be a [Windows 7 or Chrome issue](https://superuser.com/questions/1094634/smileys-emoticons-missing-in-windows-7). Bummer.
/u/Manireddit01 tipped /u/cgminer 0.1 mBTC ($0.65 = 0.56 â‚¬ = Â£0.50)
"I read both subs and make up my own mind.

Think for yourself"
That's great dude, but obviously you haven't read any significant amount.

You should have put your OC in a safe instead of posting it on the internet. 
Wow, if only there were places to discuss Bitcoin outside of r/Bitcoin.
"Itâ€™s really weird to see an entire technology centered around freedom of speech and freedom from corrupt authority be so saturated with people who promote those exact things. 

Iâ€™ve become thoroughly confused by the Bitcoin BTC community.  I guess human nature is just so corrupt that it kicks in, in certain situations no matter what. Especially when the topic relates to money.

Sad that these people allow their lack of morality to control their actions. But they simply donâ€™t give a shit. Makes me feel good about myself though right?"
I usually don't like memes, but this made me chuckle. Well done!
"The picture quality decreased after removing people from view.

That's just another similarity to \/r\/bitcoin, frankly said. The \/r\/bitcoin picture is fading away. Soon nobody will see it."
Haha. Good one!
Good to see my OC reposted...
A+, would defo laugh again
Pretty accurate haha
Keep it small, comrade!
What makes you think bitcoin is fading away ? Iâ€™m assuming you think bch is not? 
More like.. [this. ](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/Soviet_censorship_with_Stalin2.jpg)
yay... another post about r/bitcoin and how they're so unfair.
Your response is just a square for me. Am I missing some emoji pack or something? On a laptop in chrome :/
hey George 668! Karma is a bitch.
"You are absolutely correct. It doesn't get more weird than:

censoring censorship-resistant money"
"If you consider moderation censorship then yes /r/bitcoin is censored.

But /r/btc has been promoting ETH a lot almost to the point of a sub-takeover.

/r/bitcoin is moderated to only write about the chain with the most proof of work. "
