"Sorry to hijack... just two comments

>What I meant was, and what I guess my vision is, is that Bitcoin has the power to change attitudes related to wealth accumulation and market behaviour. Normal currencies are inflationary, which drives users (historically, everyone in the world) to accumulate wealth purely on the basis of survival. Even if one has a store of wealth, its relative value will diminish over time and one is required to accumulate more just to maintain its value. This system encourages, rewards and fosters the inherent greed you mention. Bitcoin can do away with this toxic influence on society because it's deflationary.

I think you have this upside down. Fit currencies are inflationary because the central bank prints more and more currency every year. The real question is... why? Let's avoid conspiracy theories, the oft cited economic reason is that inflation induces people to spend, rather than hoard: 

""*Today I can buy a TV with $1,000. If I put it under the mattress, in a year from now I won't be able to buy a TV, or will have to buy a worse one. So I'll spend the money now.*""

And this is good for the economy because it induces production, so jobs and everything. **This is the reason why every central bank has a target inflation around 2%.** A little bit of inflation stimulates the economy.

WIth Bitcoin it's the opposite... you hodl because tomorrow you can buy more. This leads to less consumption, less production, less jobs and so on. A quick Google gave me [this criticism to Bitcoin](https://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2014/04/money).




&nbsp;

> The only reason block rewards don't seem ""big"" is because people seem to think 10 sat/b is a ""normal"" or ""low"" fee. 10 sat/b is massive given the value of Bitcoin atm. Nobody should be paying more than a few fractions of a cent to send a transaction, let alone dollars.

In my opinion there's too much focus on fees... fees are only a small part of the entire ""Bitcoin project"". It is also a frequently mis-understood one.

For every credit card transaction you make, you pay an average fee of ~3.5%. You may not see this, but you do. And you don't see it because it's hidden in the price of whatever it is that you buy! Ask any merchant what is his credit card cost, and they'll tell you it's between 2% and 5%. You pay for that, he's certainly not covering that cost for you. And that's also the reason why some merchants simply don't take credit cards below, say, $10 - It just costs them too much.

Truth is, **moving money has a cost**. It's a bit like friction in physics - When you move an object, you dissipate some energy because of friction. I don't know if the *true* cost of moving money is like you say <1c or ~$1, but moving money has a cost, and no matter what we do we won't be able to do away with it. And bigger blocks don't really solve this... there's no free lunch, so someone is paying for that. Who is paying? People who run full nodes, because all of a sudden their bandwidth will not be enough anymore. Think about it... low transaction costs don't come for free. Big blocks just distribute the cost.

With this in mind, and keep in mind that just like you I would like to have fees as low as possible, if you adopt a pragmatic (rational investor) approach, you should be able to avoid all the frustration. Use fiat or plastic for small purchases, and use Bitcoin when it's warranted. Currently Bitcoin can be a bit like FedEx, fast but expensive. If you stick with ""USPS"" for normal payments, and use the ""premium service"" only when necessary, you'll have avoided all the pain with high fees. Once L2 solutions are in place, on the other hand, things will change, and txs costs will go down for BTC as well."
"Whooaaaaa this shit is crazy! Great investigative skills, must have taken a lot of effort but I think it paid off as the evidence found of a false flag is damning. I don't think Greg was acting alone while operating the bot network but he was definitely a part of the effort.

Btw there is a typo in the first sentence in ""SUSPICIOUS COMMENT #2"", it should mention [CU-1] instead of [CU-2]."
"Re inflation... To see more clearly the effect of inflation, hoarding vs spending, consider an extreme case - Hyperinflation. At it's worst, in Zimbabwe people would be quoted one price for a loaf of bread in the morning and a higher one in the afternoon. Nobody wanted to hoard the money, dump it as fast as you can for something of real value. For low inflation this is not entirely visible, but the same effect is still there. When you say

> I even have a year to turn my $1k into more money (even if it's just the basic inflation rate I get from a savings account).

that's ***exactly*** what the central bank wants you to do... try to turn it into more money, by investing. I.e. taking risk, and hence stimulating the economy. (I can guarantee that the base interest on your money will not beat inflation.)

>Problems start to rise, as people all over the world have begun to see, when our wages don't rise proportionately.

This is the real problem, not inflation in itself. (Before I continue, let it be clear that I'm all for a deflationary currency, if nothing else to see how it all turns out.) The problem is that slowly we've been paid less and less not because of inflation, but simply because our wages were not growing as fast. Let's put it differently, if inflation is 5%, and you get a 4% raise, you are getting paid less! And why would companies do that? Well, to maximise their profits! Again, not saying that is a good thing or anything, merely that inflation by itself is not the cause... it just simplifies paycheck erosion.

On the ""jobs"" I strongly disagree. Not because your argument is wrong, we do have the means to support everyone on Earth, but because there's more at play. What? I'll leave you with a thought by Pascal, 17th century French intellectual:

> “*All of humanity's problems stem from man's inability to sit quietly in a room alone.*”


&nbsp;

You are 100% correct that intermediation increases costs, and that's what blockchain will do, ""dis-intermediate"". That's one of the main things I had in mind when I said that there's more to Project Bitcoin than just fees. So yes, the blockchain will reduce costs of moving money, but what is the end point is not really clear. Not to me, not to you, nor to anyone else. 

Let's take an example. To buy some coins in a dip, I wanted to move funds to Gemini. A ""same-day ACH transfer"" from my banks cost me $30. The funds were deposited within 4hrs. This is not made up... these are real costs, which we cannot ignore. What Bitcoin will do is reduce that fee and/or decrease the time it takes to transfer. But I cannot claim that the ""true cost"" will be $0.03 or $20. In any event, *it will be lower*.

Similarly, I had to pay some money via plastic internationally. I paid credit card charges. Trust me, I would have been VERY happy with a fee of $20, my actual fee was **a lot more**.

So **Bitcoin is already fulfilling the promise of cost reduction** today. 

Does that mean we should be happy to pay, say, $2 in fee for a $4 coffee? No, of course not. We had super low fees for a relatively long time in Bitcoin because only a few nerds and geeks were using it. And this is still true for virtually every altcoin today! Every other coin will face the same problems Bitcoin faces, if they reach a large enough number of users. (Including the in-fights and disagreements on how to scale, especially if there's no central authority to dictate the way forward.) What this does mean, imo, is that Bitcoin is going through some ""growing pains"" where it's not **currently** feasible to use for a pack of bubble gum & coffee. Once L2 solutions are developed, sooner than many people seem to believe, we'll have that again. Right now, just use Bitcoin if it makes (financial) sense. If not, keep using plastic. To me that's an acceptable price to pay for a truly disruptive technology.

As I said above, there's no free lunch... someone is paying for those fees, even if you don't see it.

As for BTC/XBT and scalability, my hopes are pinned on the Lightening network.

I know there is a lot of BCH supporters around here, so I know I might get flamed....

....I do wish people would stop trying to claim BCH as the true Bitcoin. It's futile to do so. People have to remember that there is money flowing into Bitcoin from the regulated stock exchanges and people are doing long term holds as part of their pensions etc. Institutional investors don't see high fees as a deal breaker right now, but would never-the-less like it sorted.

If BCH is fast and low cost - then great. There are plenty of cryptos that are low cost and fast - and they don't see the need to crown themselves as the bitcoin core killer in order to survive.

The BTC core chain will survive as there is too much money that has flowed in since the BCH split and that type of money continues to flow in. 

Also, I can't see merchants taking cryptos directly in the long term....their accounts would be a nightmare. They want to deal in one currency. Payment networks are best suited to solving that problem.

The first exchange to offer direct BCH crypto trading pairs will see a lot of profit and traffic. It won't be Bitfinex.

The BTC trading pair dominance is helping to prop up BTC.

In order to remove Blockstream and corporate control of Bitcoin we need more trading pairs from friendly exchanges, the support of Coinbase, BitPay and the miners.

In deed. You can be early adopter for some technology and laggard for something else. I found Bitcoin in 2010, when I was actually looking for something like it; internet cash without middlemen. I got lucky. Not many knew about it back then, and I could not find an easily accessible exchange until a year later. *I* felt late to the party back then, until I realized how few we were. My first bitcoin cost me 9.50€, if only I had bought a bunch :-). I still think the amount of people using these technologies are a limited few. Hope you enjoy, there's plenty of adventure left to witness.

So legacy bitcoin or full block coin instead?

Wouldn't it make more sense just to title BTC as Bitcoin? 
This just further illustrates either your lack of understanding of bitcoin or your insistence to be a vitriolic force of misinformation. Bitcoin Cash is the name of a fork. Bitcoin Core is an implementation of Bitcoin. You’d be more accurate listing Bitcoin ABC and Bitcoin Core. But you’d rather continue the misinformation campaign. If you’re so big on freedom of choice, maybe be honest for once so people can make an informed decision? 
Why even continue to support both across your bitcoin.com products? You should pick one ideal of what “Bitcoin” is to you and support that exclusively, and nothing else. If you believe Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin, isn’t supporting both so prominently on your site not so different to if pepsi.com also emphasised Coca cola.
Where did the standard BTC one disappear?
You're kinda of right, legacy bitcoin or full block coin would be a better name
Not necessarily. Core isn't just a software package, it's also a group of developers. There's other Bitcoin software that follows the Core consensus rules and tracks when they change. Likewise, there's six or so different Bitcoin Cash implementations whose developers also have a process for deciding upon software changes. Hence, the logic is which group of developers manages the cryptocurrency and decides upon changes to it.

Do you think BCH can be THE blockchain in which all others collapse into. Or do you think there will be an exchange of chains hereforth?

Ether already has more transaction volume than BTC and is faster and has expandable block sizes built into the protocol, BCH has extremely minimal transaction volume. Why would the market migrate from the already dominante coin used for transactions to a much much much much slower coin? BCH is a coin created out of spite in protest of Core and nothing more. The use case scenario of cheap onchain transaction has already had its market void filled by Ether long ago.

Back in August, Bitcoin Cash forked to steer things back to the original track, without the influence of the Core devs.

Higher fees on Bitcoin Cash happens due to misprogrammed wallets; unlike with the Core chain, there is no inherent need for anyone to try to pay more than anyone else with the increased capacity of the Bitcoin Cash chain.

>I hate PoW, even more one that's dependent on ASIC.

That's a whole'nother conversation. On a side note, you can't have a PoW that's ASIC proof; as soon as mining the coin becomes profitable enough, the cost to develop specialized hardware will be worth it."
Great job on completely ignoring the point I was making...
Thank you! I’ll read it all through.
Bitcoin Cash chain is also almost 9.6k blocks ahead of BTC thanks to its EDA.
well you sure dont mind that Halong Mining is either a scam or they are using the same fuckin optimisations 
:)
At least all miners were open to benefit from that issue. Slightly less of a problem than a closed private pre-mine.
**PRE**mine.  Get it?  **PRE**.  As in, *before other people got any.* . Get it?
You're making too many assumptions here. I don't care about halong mining. I care about the security of bitcoin, and the existence of non-obvious performance optimizations is a threat to bitcoin's security.
It will be harder for BCH to reach BTC price since there's more BCH in the market than BTC. Which makes BTC more scarce asset.
How? As long as these optimizations don't break consensus, how are they a threat to bitcoin's security?
"Bitcoins security is measured in the amount of dollars in hashing equipment required to attack the network. But if there are undiscovered performance improvements, it may be much cheaper to attack the network than expected.

It also threatens miner decentralization by making it more costly to develop ASICs, which is also a security issue."
"ASICboost is not undiscovered. It's been discovered. Now everyone knows about it, the market is equal. Are you suggesting that further hardware or software optimizations won't be discovered because ""SegWit"" exists? Do you expect that any such optimizations will be disclosed to the public immediately, because ""SegWit"" exists?

Mining will be centralized where electricity and hardware is cheap, full stop.  No amount of SegWit will stop that.

I do not think that ""existing in a global economic marketplace"" is a security issue, and trying to fight it by introducing radical changes to how bitcoin works seems extremely risky."
"Right... just like AESBoost (AES-NI) was an ""attack"" by Intel on the entire computing industry... before AMD also figured out how to add it that is."
I didn't say asicboost is an attack. I said asicboost is a security vulnerability.
"> anyone that doesn't follow Blockstreams vision is ridiculed and harassed until they leave.

They don't just get ridiculed and harrassed, but also banned or shadowbanned without warning."
Someone's got triggered LOL
Valid is what miners decide is valid.
"Bitcoin Cash is certainly more friendly to multiple dev teams than Bitcoin is. But it's rather evident that Bitcoin ABC is the dominate one as is it evident that various other node implementations for Bitcoin do exist.

As for Bitcoin.org remember that it's owned by a /r/Bitcoin mod, so yeah it's not the most open minded of sites."

Roger won’t ever phase out BTC on bitcoin.com. He  has no ideals or conviction and is too scared to throw his full weight behind BCH. 
If you genuinely believe Bitcoin Cash is the one true Bitcoin, it makes no sense to promote BTC on your site. I’d never put Bitcoin Cash stuff on bitcoin.org. But you include both on bitcoin.com. You’re too much of a coward to commit to one.. because “omg muh investments..”
Oops, my bad. Sorry, I’m still pretty new and seeing Bitcoin core holding BTC makes me confused.
Needs Bitcoin Gold and numerous other forks for completion.

"From: https://www.bitcoincash.org/#wallets

Which Development Team is In Charge of Bitcoin Cash?

>Unlike the previous situation in Bitcoin, there is no one single development team for Bitcoin Cash. There are now multiple independent teams of developers.

* bitcoin.org lists bitcoin core in the Resources menu. 
* https://bitcoin.org/en/download takes you to bitocin core.
* bitcoin.org is scattered with references to 'full node clients like Bitcoin Core'. 
* https://bitcoin.org/en/posts/how-to-run-a-full-node refers to Bitcoin Core as the reference client.
* The bitcoin community is full of posts and examples which state the bitcoin core's consensus rules is what make's bitcoin bitcoin."

what's your point? valid isn't the one you like best..valid has a mathematical definition in this context..
"Define ""valid"". "
"How so?

I disagree.

I support Cash, but I'd never, ever support it if it branded itself as Bitcoin, unless there was overwhelming consensus.

Real Bitcoin my ass, Satoshi would vomit if he saw this two coins in the hands of 1-2 miners in the world and 90% of hashrate being basically concentrated among 8 people.

Cash's better than Bitcoin, but it ain't no great coin at all."
"optimisation of hardware isn't an attack despite what Blockstream will tell you.

"
How is this an argument? Someone could just as easily say you're being paid by Jihan, actually you sound way more shilly tbh.
Do some more research. There are two ways that ASICBoost can be implemented. Only one is incompatible with SegWit
"> I need to create a smart contract just to see past received transactions

No you don't. 

>Ethereum at this time feels more like a prototype for geeks than a real payment solution.

Indeed it is. Though can't that be said about all crypto including BCH?"

Cobra-Bitcoin won't ever phase out Core on bitcoin.org.  He has no ideals or conviction and is too scared to throw his full weight behind Bitcoin Gold.
Why? BTC could still up the cap and ditch Segwit, so a big blocker has no moral obligation to sell all their BTC. The specific chain isn't as important as the total Bitcoin ledger.
You're not going to produce proof that you sold your Bitcoin Cash, are you?
"> I’d never put Bitcoin ~~Cash~~ Knots stuff on bitcoin.org

FTFY"
I think as a libertarian, he believes choice is important. Having both BTC and BCH is congruent with that belief.
"Diversifying assets is the best way to plan for uncertain futures. For example I have a small amount of assets in Cryptocurrencies, about the same in stocks, more in lower risk mutual funds, and the rest in cash.

Picking just one of anything in order to be a true believer is just foolish."
Roger can't commit to BitcoinCash exclusively because he is on the wrong side of the deal and he knows it.
Why that makes you confused?
Well Core can develop such a wallet, they are sponsoring all those forks after all.
No need to include scamcoins that users might be tricked into equating with Bitcoin Cash.
You're so welcoming to open discussion and critical thinking. /s
It's possible to mine with obvious asicboost on the main chain by simply excluding sw transactions. SW transactions are still a minority, so this would be easy to accomplish with plenty of compatible transactions still available. If the purported cost savings and profit of running asicboost was true we'd see it used with impunity on the segwit chain. We don't, so you can be assured that at some point you've been deliberately misled.
Shhh, you're disturbing the circlejerk.
"Giving people a choice, letting newbies decide for themselves. Bitcoin Cash loves even you, no one gets left behind! ;)"
"I got that wallet early on to have somewhere to put BCH not even knowing that it supported BTC.  After I loaded some BCH, I found it was easy to also put BTC in there.  Its a great wallet.

All the crying at the other camp is FUD."
"All the issues I had were fixed with hours of complaining. I use Android.

I'm very impressed. 

There is another anomaly importing base58 addresses. It's a reprodusable anomaly not uneque to bitcoin.com wallet. "
These posts are worse than Trump rallies. 
">  Don't you think ""BCore"" would be a better label for the bottom wallet?

xd"
I can confirm it on my end.
Did they just rebranded CoPay's open-source wallet?
Coming across the board in the next update.
Yes roger Bitcoin china best wallet
Bitcoin Cash is bitcoin.   It's core who chose to be infiltrated by the bankers.
"You are overthinking dude... 

-

- First, You have an advantage if you can read 

-

- Secondly, BCH coins accidentally sent to a BTC wallet and vice versa will be credited in their respective wallets.  In both cases, you win! But winning is better with BCH these days ;)

Enjoy the show! "
"The original Bitcoin doesn't exist anymore; if any chain deserves to be called just Bitcoin, that would be Bitcoin Cash."
Bitcoin fan. There's no such thing as Bitcoin core. Just Bitcoin. And alts. A handful of which are interesting.
Should be Bitcoin Legacy instead of bitcoin core.
"This is GREAT! For those who are wondering what is news about this: Until this update ""Bitcoin Core"" was referred to as ""Bitcoin"" in the wallet. This makes explaining Bitcoin much easier for me! Right before christmas when I'm going to install this wallet and tip my family members some BCH ha"
Should have done “Bitcoin Legacy” if he really wanted to rile up the small blockers.
No idea why these BCH fans wants to put their hope into a single miner, even buy paypal stock is smarter choice
BCH wallet logo should be green
"I don't think that renaming coins is a good thing:

It's bad to call the Bitcoin Cash, bcash, and it's bad to call the Bitcoin, Bitcoin Core. I mean those coins have a name, why renaming them?"
"Ok, so I'm sure this comment is going to get downvoted and I'll be accused of ""concern trolling,"" but frankly I'm worried about this causing unnecessary confusion.  Don't you think ""BCore"" would be a better label for the bottom wallet?"
I went to r/bitcoin to see the shitstorm about it, but it's all memes about the price.
Bitcoin core is a more descriptive name. There are multiple chains that forked from Bitcoin now, and it makes sense to use a descriptive, specific name to describe the legacy chain. 
"Bitcoin Core forfeited the right to be called bitcoin the day you got into bed with the bankers.

""Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks"".

"
">Like Bitcoin Cash isn't BCash.

I think a better analogy is that Bitcoin Cash isn't Bitcoin ABC.

But don't call Bitcoin SegWitCoin or SegShitCoin or BlockstreamCoin because Bitcoin Cash isn't BCash."
I know maximalists hate this so much. I’m learning to live with it though. I just want the space to grow. 
The best way for them to coexists is by them having distinctive names. “Bitcoin” could refer to both BCH or BTC so obviously that would cause confusion... I think Bitcoin Core sounds better than Bitcoin Legacy, right?
Agreed and the most childish and divisive comments on both /r/btc and /r/bitcoin get upvoted and all nuanced comments get downvoted.
I can confirm this as well. I await r/Bitcoin shitshow.
fuck yes
If that's the case then shouldn't Bitcoin Cash here be labled Bitcoin ABC instead? That way both chains would be labled in accordance with the same logic. 
"Thats better, yes.
"
totally agree
"This is exactly how everyone should refer to the major Bitcoin forks:

- One is the continuation of Satoshi’s original peer-2-peer Cash vision “the first line of the white paper” preserved in the form of Bitcoin Cash (BCH).

- One is the version which Bitcoin Core decided to take a huge gamble with and create a new set of game-theory rules on, introducing segwit. BTC for Bitcoin Core or BTS for Bitcoin Segwit is the most appropriate.

If anyone takes offence in the above then they’re either logically or mentally challenged, or they have a nefarious agenda to introduce inflation on Bitcoin (through patented 2nd layer technologies ) while not explaining what their agendas really are. "
"I agree. 

Bitcoin Core is a group of developers. 

Leaving it as it is—Bitcoin Cash vs Bitcoin—is clearer. 

I want Bitcoin Cash to succeed but this seems petty.

Let's focus our energies on increasing adoption versus having semantical arguments."
So it doesn't support normal Bitcoin at all?
Yeah but I don't like the attitude the wink implies. 
Certainly clarifies things.
"Much less deceptive than calling the Core chain ""Bitcoin"" when they've moved so far from the original Bitcoin."
"Yeah, just like calling the US Gold Eagle ""gold"" is deceptive.  I mean, the Krugerrand has been a ""gold"" coin much longer than the Eagle.  To call the US Eagle a ""gold coin"" is deceptive.  Period.

Moreover, what if the Eagle was 99.99% gold and the Krugerrand was only 80% gold, would anyone cry if people said that the Eagle was now the ""real"" gold coin because the old (segwit) coin isn't pure gold anymore?

When I read Luke-Jr's latest rants that Segwit shouldn't be used, I realize more now than ever that BCH is MORE Bitcoin than BTC."
[removed]
We reached a settlement. It will officially become hyphenated. Bitcoin Cash will forever be called Bit-Coin from this day forward.
"Perhaps is should be bitcoin legacy, or bitcoin segwit, or bitcoin settlement.

Or perhaps should be called hashcash extended with capacity control."
"Not anymore ;)"
Which one supports ASICBoost?
I must say Bitcoin cash is a much better brand name
BCore - the coin to hodl
Busy stealing peoples private keys.
"I think it's misguiding and deceptive, and this comes from a bitcoin cash supporter.

Consensus around Core is to call it simply Bitcoin.

You guys can't blame /r/bitcoin for saying that we want to take over the branding with such actions.

Downvote me as much as you want, but this is deceptive, period."
😘
nah, Legacy gives is a tone of legitimacy - there isn't much legitimate about Blockstream's bank owners and financial support of core.
"Well there is the fact that only one is called Bitcoin and that multiple node implementations (btc suite, knots, bitcore) also fallows the same chain as Bitcoin Core.

If we're going to start naming things based on most popular reference node implementation then maybe we should start calling ""Bitcoin Cash"" ""Bitcoin ABC"" instead?

People will dislike this because it's a marketing tactic meant to down play the legitimacy of the real Bitcoin and consensus over which chain is Bitcoin by suggesting that both chains are equality Bitcoin, even though the market and hashrate begs to differ.

Edit: Bitcoin supporters who are also opposed to Core's central governance should also be critical of this as labeling ""Bitcoin"" as ""Bitcoin Core"" down plays the decentralization of Bitcoin and emboldens Core's leadership role. We must remain vigilant and remember that Core does not control Bitcoin they are but mere participants in the network. "
"busy with stealing private keys. 

https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/bitcoin-gold-wallet-scam-nets-fraudsters-3-2-million-after-stealing-users-private-keys/"
It's an SPV wallet. They shouldn't be using those anyway. They can carry their raspi full nodes.
where's bitcoin gold 
Good point.
"Not even close. 

BTC processes more transactions in one single block than BCH does in 8 hours"
All I know is that I greatly dislike the drama between BTC and BCH. It's turning me off to both and sending be over to ether. It's gross
Alphabet is biased because the Romans are big blockers
I believe 000001-Bitcoin Core would be the superior wallet.. 
Misleading and immature.
The general public doesn't know what is what so this is still kind of scammy
AAAAAA-Bitcoin Cash
I thought it was called SegShit Core
The need to call Bitcoin “Bitcoin Core” is childish. Same as calling Bitcoin Cash “B-Cash”. The two cryptocurrencies need to be able to coexist and posts like this are counterproductive.
Thanks Roger. I am a big fan of calling things what they are.

Oh snap!
"Noobs are going to think they can send Bitcoin from an exchange to this ""Bitcoin Cash"" wallet to use it for their daily transactions."
"""Bitcoin Core"" is not a currency. It's a wallet, formerly known as bitcoin-qt and also the name of a group of developers. The currency is named bitcoin."
No issues, the Bitcoin.com wallet will direct the coins the BCH or BTC wallet. Nothing gets lost. 
Does BCH have more transactions than BTC per day?

Trump rallies are great! They are like my family reunions! Theres 15 people, some are racist, some are religious fanatics, the young ones spend their time being edgelords on 4chan and the old ones hate poor people even though they are poor. So fun
"Trump rallies were awesome. I can't wait for the second round and 7 more years.

Deal with it cucklord."
"The number was merely illustrative.

The point is that if you buy a bitcoin for the market price + $1, then the market cap moves by $16 000 000+.

In other words, the amount of Tether is utterly disconnected from BTC's market cap."
You can't buy a single Bitcoin for $1 million on exchange unless you eat through all the asks at a lower price.
