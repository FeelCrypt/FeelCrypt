The fees are stupid, 20$ to send 50? Bitcoin will NEVER amount to anything like that
I've been wondering what people's transactions are that are finally confirming today! It's weird how these transactions are finally going through, BTC weirdly sputtering along.
Not to mention the time that you exposed your cold storage private key to a networked computer which may have been compromised, and thus had the threat of the transaction being replaced by a hacker.
"Worse than in a wallet if there is ever a crash.

Can you imagine the three week agony?"
They used the wrong coin.
Hmmm ripple clears the entire transaction in 3-4 seconds and Money moves into the receivers account.    Visa final clearance take take 1-3 business days to finalize.  Not sure where your going if not TPS.  But clearly your mistaken in the speed of a transaction here also. 
And now? I would have been in the same boat has I not bribed a miner to mine it quickly. In BCH I might add. This convinced me to sell the last of my BTC.
Best of luck to you! 
"Real world usability it doesn't matter if it is an hour or a month.

"If you move them from a paper wallet to an online wallet you can't use them until you have X number of conf.

I'm waiting over an hour for 4 conf now...downvote all you want people IDGAF. 

I'm a BCH supporter but how is this better than core? 

This morning I moved a significant amount of BTC, BCH, BCG from old paper wallets to my online accounts...the last one I'm waiting for is BCH for some reason.  

Edit: Seems like there has been an hour gap in blocks coincidentally...not necessarily the fault of BCH, but still...irritating.

"Too bad he wasn’t transferring USD via the credit card system...

As for scaling. Suggest you update your FUD.  It scales to 70k transactions per second.  Just as much as credit card issuers....

">Ripple has chargebacks! 

Oh shit, it does? It really is Bankercoin."

Xrb is a good coin too. Can’t wait to see where it goes
"I am a fan of ripple. I would have told you that without a history search.  My points are still valid as much as anyone here providing info on BCH. 

What is apparent is people here actually need to go do a little due diligence on XRP. 

Point still stands.  Transferring money via ripple is faster and cheaper. "
Exactly. 
They should, however a node in the network can repeatedly rebroadcast the message. Best guess for why they are clearing now is that a lot of darknet & gambling sites accept bch  now.
That was not the question.
Where do you see that low amount? I see 120k at the moment. 
No one is neutral. I'm on the BCH side. What's happening is that it's a holiday so it isn't completely breaking yet. Look at the [six month mempool graph](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#6m), you can see that it's freaked out similarly in July and August but then managed to settle. It's possible that will happen again this time and this won't be the time it stays broken.
My educated guess is that the holiday week saw a lot less transactions because many people were not trading. 
3 conf in 1 hour seems to be variance. Why are you in a hurry ?
The problem is on the side of the exchange which should accept BCH with only 1 or 2 conf, and bad luck because of the 1h gap between 2 blocks which is very rare
It's the amount per byte that counts. Perhaps the ones you're seeing with higher fees are larger.
Before you aggressively argue with strangers on the internet, I suggest you learn the difference between scaling and transaction speed.
"What you miss is that XRP is not a cryptocurrency. It does not have a blockchain. Is not mineable. It is capable of such throughput only because it is a centralized, non-proof of work based system.

Comparing it to decentralized, proof of work based currencies is a demonstration of complete ignorance. "
"more than it needs

More than BTC needs at this time.

In other words, enough for fast transactions for it and BTC put together."
"visa can do it faster. 
"
RaiBlocks can do it for free and isn't centralized banking money.
xrb does it in 2 seconds for 0 cents
Just took a look at your history, he is really a pro-Ripple. (So he probably deserve hate, but not insults)
"so would your visa card

you're missing the whole point of ""permissionless"""
RaiBlocks can do it in 2 for free. 
3 weeks ago it was a reasonable fee suggested by the wallet. Unfortunately op is not a fortune teller and, like me, didn't realise satoshis per byte were going to explode like they did.
"> ~~Well you're the idiot who did $1.27 fee.~~

[woman gets raped]

""Well, you're the idiot that went out in public.""

Something like that?"
Shouldn't that transaction have been kicked out of the Mempool at the 2 week mark?
"The fee estimations don't consider busy and less busy phases.  They just see that 50 sat/B took three weeks to confirm. So they assume 50 is not enough, even though it currently is.  The opposite happened three weeks ago when 100 sat/B used to confirm quickly but suddenly didn't.

The Christmas and New Year holidays were less busy than the week before. It's not that surprising if you think about it. Also the stepwise difficulty updates while the miners continuously add mining power were strengthening the effect.  If fee estimations would consider this, they could be more precise (provided not everyone is using them, otherwise their own predictions would invalidate the estimates)."
Because it's the new year it's 2018. Bitcoin started it's New Year's Resolution.
I'm not sure, i'm pretty confused by all this, that's why i ask
Online services require different amounts of confirmations, if something wants a lot of confirmations, it's gonna take a while. If the hashrate is unstable it might take longer for blocks to be found, the mechanism is not different from BTC.
I see, that makes sense, ty
was my guess as well, but the amount was such a huge reduction
"I though you were trolling.

Even if Paypal was cheaper, it's not what I am interested in. 
I tried to understand several times Ripple but I can't understand why it is a cryptocurrency. There is no blockchain and no POW. Thus I will stay as far as I can from this thing. I want decentralization, open source, no trust, no BS, just maths."
"""Winning!"" -someone on this sub, probably."
This sub exists mainly for confused people
Fee estimation is an inherently unsolvable problem it's the main reason a fee market will never be efficient.
It is 2014 resolution?
perfectly reasonable.  i used to move coins around routinely to improve all aspects of my situation, including security.  now, these hi fees introduce all sorts of unwanted impediments.
You can sell your BTC for BCH, ETH, or XMR on Bittrex.
Typo, I meant bch but for some reason spaced out.
this is true, if you supported bitcoin then realized legacy bitcoin wasn't bitcoin you would come here and be confused, but the truth shall set you free
"Really?

I thought it was for people who didn't want to be banned when they commented with an opinion that the mods didn't like

Then again maybe it is for people who are confused about being banned from r/bitcoin for posting a dissenting opinion"
"I've been in this since 2012...I know about block variance. 

I just got caught out by a rare 1 hour block variance...I thought BCH was better in this regard. "
You don't even need a confirmation, you can create a child transaction without a confirmation.
"None of your business what i want to use them for.
 
The first conf took an hour due to block variance. "
"Let me rephrase for the semantics game your clearly trying to play.   It can go as fast as the CC networks when it has a use case requiring it to do so.  If it was needed to do that many TPS tomorrow, it could. 

"
Now that is a fair, reasoned, response!  We disagree but that is ok!  As an investor, there is money to be played on both sides.   I used to feel the same way as you, now I see that both techs have purpose and a future. 
It’s a verify different type of digital asset. Coins that solve real world problems in the financial industry are very different than digital commodities or coins that act as currency. I only own a small amount of coins like ripple, iota, and stellar, but I would like increase holdings of these coins to 30-40 percent.
With Raiblocks you get the transaction in 5 seconds.

"again, I'm not talking about scaling. 

you're clearly missing the point here. 
"
i'm trying to understand how you could need to wait any length of time before doing something with your bitcoin... it's not the bitcoin network itself that's making you wait... i'm guessing you're using it somewhere where they're requiring some number of confirmations, so that would be their policy, anywhere can make any policy they want about waiting for confirmations and many places have *extremely* conservative rules
Wanted to move my coins from an insecure wallet to a secure wallet...
haha true, guess the opportunity cost is really for everything since that money is basically held hostage.
But you can't get more BCH until you can transfer your btc.
"I assume that by ""online wallet"" he means an exchange of some sort, they typically require a number of confirmations before releasing the coin"
"> I just got caught out by a rare 1 hour block variance...I thought BCH was better in this regard.

"if you've been here since 2012, you'd know you're being hypercritical:

https://fork.lol/blocks/time

blame your exchange, not BCH."
We're still at the mercy of randomness
Isn't the exchange you're moving it to the real issue? That is, they're the ones demanding 4 confirmations before you can do something?
[deleted]
you know about block times and how they vary, right? The average 10 minutes per block is just an average, it can easily take more than an hour for a single block and that is true for both BCH and BTC
use them for what? you can send them to another address as soon as they have a single confirmation
"> If you move them from a paper wallet to an online wallet you can't use them until you have X number of conf.

From the standpoint of the system, you can create a follow-up transaction even without the first one being confirmed. In that case, all these transactions will likely be included in the same block.

From your description of the problem, by ""online wallet"", you probably mean a custodian that is *not* you. These wallets are not needed (or advised) in order to simply transact. Being able to directly send money from your own personal wallets (:no custodian or third party) is pretty much the reason for Bitcoin. Most such software support sweeping paper wallets.

If a custodian is really what you want (:exchanges, etc.), it is normal for the recipient to wait for 6 confirmations for finalization though. 1-2 hours is not really extreme.
"
"> If you move them from a paper wallet to an online wallet you can't use them until you have X number of conf.

It depends on the wallet. Some wallets allow you to spend right away; it's not the fault of BCH. What wallet are you using?

Basically; blame your wallet, not BCH. "
did I say anything about scaling LMAO. 
It's 2014 resolution?
why do you need 4?
"Ripple has chargebacks! Ripple isn't even blockchain based.. it's some sort of ""trusted nodes network"" and its corporate owned"

No proof of work = Not a cryptocurrency. 
"Was it a good coffee? ;-)"
No, supply inflation. That's what happens when things can be created out of thin air and there is no mechanism to stop it. Such is the case for XRP. 
Why you're still using core is beyond me. 
"Ripple would have done it in 4 seconds for a fraction of a penny..... 

Hate incoming in 3,2,1...."
BUT MUH RASPBERRY PI ZERO NODE CONFIRMING MY 34,085 MINUTE SELF VERIFIED TRANSACTION!!
stop complaining.
I signed a $2.00 fee SEGWIT transaction that was confirmed within 3 minutes.  That's the reality of bitcoin today.
"Are you valuing the tx fee at the USD ratio at the time of transmission or at the USD ratio today?

The value of the tx fee dropped about 50% between then and now."
How many tp/s can bch do?
are you guys still competing with bitcoin :D other altcoins already forgot about bitcoin. it's not even worth to compare.
"A few hours vs 20 more days. $1.27 vs $0.00127? Same thing?

If you're moving to an exchange you have to wait multiple confirmations for their sake. Not the protocol."
I just moved some BCH from a paper wallet an hour ago and I still don't have 4 conf in order to use them...seems no better as far as I'm concerned.  
How is that possible when higher fees are waiting?
"Consensus, huh?

Is that what happens when the banks that control XRP create coins out of thin air?"
Deleted out of chain
"I don’t think you know enough about ripple to be commenting at this point...

Do your homework, XRP also has its pros and cons but your point is no where close to accurate. 

The supply of XRP will never increase by ripple or the banks, in fact a very small amount is destroyed at each transaction. "
So it seems I will get mine transaction confirmed after 3 weeks as well. Transfering from wallet to TenX 
Sounds scalable.
"Every single thing I said is factually accurate and independently verifiable. 

"
Lucky you mine hasn't confirmed since Dec 5
"Please feel free to share a link showing banks can create new xrp. 

"
I signed a transaction worth less than three dollars recently. I'm ready to wait until July.
"The burden would be on you to demonstrate that there is some type of inflation control mechanism. 

When top XRP officials themselves have been asked about this, they admit there is no means of inflation control. "
I did a similar transaction with a fee of $4.50. It took 7,699 minutes.
Prove it
Was wondering the same, why all of sudden from Dec to yesterday adn today the amount of unconfirmed tx when from 40k to barely 3kish. i was looking at the graphs and the peaks don't look normal at all, also was wondering why all pages list 15 usd as the min fee for BTC when the graphs shows that tx with as lil as 2 usd are getting now confirmed easily and relatively quickly.  Can someone explain ? (preferibly someone that's not a BTC or BCH shill please)
Probably a little cold
uh what do you mean, use them for what, i'll take them
[deleted]
When I created the transaction it was about 1 USD. At some point, the fee was 2.30 USD because of BTC gaining value. 
Was it a segwit transaction? (honest curiosity) 
 #  ThanksBlockStream
I am honestly surprised it even confirms
So what you preserved your value xD
Like it or not, bitcoin core is still the denominational currency for most markets, although ETH markets have been becoming much more prevalent. 
"Because they told me to HODL.

At those speeds you might as well just snail mail a paper wallet. You would have saved time and money haha.
"thank you :)

"it's intentional.

by those who failed to understand the WP"
"There are plenty of coins that are not mineable and considering the state of mining you could argue its becoming more centralized whereas ripple is pushing to decentralize consensus. 

Your right, it’s not PoW, it validates in a different method. PoW has pros and cons but does is not required for a Coin. 

The comparison was moving money as it relates to speed and fees.   Your arguing the difference between two types of tech in the same space.  

"
do... do you doubt this?
"Aggressively...ffs lol. Go back and read the reply:  Visa does it faster.  Ambiguous statement that I took to mean TPS.   I know full well the difference, get off your high horse.   You won nothing. 

Visa does not do it faster at this point, unless you care to point a direct CC network transaction to ripple  transaction comparison that I can read. 

"
Without seeing your reference material, I cannot speak fully to what you are implying.  Price inflation perhaps?  Not supply inflation.   There are 100 billion coins. That’s it and the supply is actually deflationary with destructive transactions.

I'm almost at 48 hours transfering from myfreewallet to binance is this typical right now?
Same as a regular transaction but less info is needed in the transaction allowing for greater transaction capacity.
I thought people said myfreewallet is a scam ?
"Though he preserved his initial value, he lost 3 weeks in opportunity cost... which in the crypto world is huge. 
edit: assuming you were moving it to trade of course. "
You paid about a dollar too much.
They at least waited about 3 weeks too long
I was just moving some coins between wallets so...
I guess you only red it up to chapter 3. The remaining chapters detail exactly how to secure that data structure.  If you choose to ignore that   well... Then you spittle be happy with what your bank offer,  which is probably a good service,  but won't possibly beat bitcoin at its game. 
If I was a rippilionaire I wouldn't be holding very long. large sell orders would be getting set... and at these prices the market will surely fall once the growth peaks.
And your point is?
"Do you have any idea how costly a 51% attack would be? And that it isn't guaranteed to work? Or what you can even accomplish with a 51% hash rate attack on a non-Segwit coin like BCH?

In addition, Ripple is a bankers coin. It is centralized. It is a scam-coin since it uses PoS. The economics don't work. The game theory is broken. 

I don't really want to argue though, so feel free to believe what you like. I'll be sticking with my mastercard and visa instead of Ripple. When it comes to a decentralized currency, my needs are met best by Bitcoin (cash). "
Banking is also a great way to transfer wealth from the poor to the rich.  How will Ripple help this process?
You said fees were ~$1 just a few hours ago when in fact nothing with that fee had gone through in weeks.
You know Roger Ver was a major BTC holder. What do you think his motive is for saying that BTC is broken and abandoning it?
Sigh, ok. I won't be able to help you lol.
I think Roger Ver is motivated by money and influence. BCH gave him significantly more of both.
"Miners are what the white paper means by ""CPU power"". Why is that so hard to understand?"
You can't steal something that is open source.
Sounds a LOT like what Blockstream did...
Uh, are you saying that Roger Ver could endorse anything, of any quality, and get the same amount of interest in it? It's not relevant whether or not BCH is actually good?
Nodes. Not miners.
But you can sure as hell name your garbage alt coin to try and trick people  into using it. How sad is that? 
"It might be good enough right now. But some people are thinking 10 years ahead. If you truly want to buy into the narrative of ""TerraByte blocks today"" every 10 minutes, then - as /u/chazley pointed out - nobody here can help you."
What CPU power do nodes control?
"Don't know what you're talking about.  Bitcoin segwit deviated from ""electronic cash"", so BTC is technically the altcoin, and BCH is Bitcoin."
Look man if you want to understand bitcoin and the difference between what a node and miner is(and why nodes are important/what role they play), go google it.
You seem like the type that would buy a plastic bracelet that promises to cleanse your toxins. Check the charts tomorrow, its going to be a fucking slaughter.
The most non-mining nodes can do is get themselves in the wrong chain, they can't change the chain itself.
Tomorrow's charts are irrelevant to me.  I am in it for the long game.
Lol ok in a year bcash is going to be gone entirely. Getting out before LN is literally your only hope. 
I don't know anything about bcash.  I am invested in Bitcoin (Cash).
Those aren't miners, they provide no hashpower.
Unfortunately you are quite misinformed on the background and holdings of Roger Ver. If you think he's merely the owner of Bitcoin.com and a supporter with no control, I cannot help you.
Looks like BCH is centralized then: https://twitter.com/lopp/status/943479553829343232
what do you mean? bitcoin is better?
Oh kiddo. 
"XD Ha ha ha.  Very clever!

It's actually going down pretty well, i guess the spam money is running out…
He didn’t make a point.  
"Again, ""decentralization"" isn't the end goal, just a way to possibly get there."
not an argument.
They could. But they *won't*.
LN will require a blocksize increase (more than likely) so I do not think there is an educated, progressive bitcoin supporter out there who does not support an eventual blocksize increase. If you support LN, you pretty much by default support a blocksize increase (whether you know it or not). I personally have advocated for an immediate blocksize increase because if it has to happen in 1, 2, 5 years, why not do it now? So, you've met one person that does not believe a small blocksize increase would increase centralization.
"> It's actually kinda scary that someone can be both brainwashed into believing this narrative and then get 34 upvotes for it.

You have no idea what you are talking about. Also, you are projecting AF.

I do not believe in either Roger Ver or Jihan Wu. I have no authorities. I believe in Satoshi Nakamoto's vision.

The only one here who is brainwashed is you. Or you are paid for it. I don't know which is worse to be honest."
This is the power of Roger Ver. A well meaning person such as yourself blindly follows his conjured narratives and thinks he is an independent thinker. Blindly following Satoshi is just as bad as blindly following Roger Ver. Satoshi created the white paper, yes. But Bitcoin and the world has changed drastically since then, and the guy(s)(gal)(s) hasn't been seen in 7 or 8 years. Things change. Trying to always keep things as they were is just not smart. 
I agree. It has to be available to and usable by every person on earth. If Bitcoin cannot achieve that while keeping decentralization, it has failed. 
Um OK great well how about we have that blocksize increase last August 1st and we already did.
What was it?
No doubt, that bird has flown already. 
"It's actually kinda scary that someone can be both brainwashed into believing this narrative and then get 34 upvotes for it. Guess Roger Ver isn't filthy rich for no reason - man is a genius.

BCH is eventually going to have a fee market (if it ever gets used more than Dogecoin). Roger Ver said it himself (during the Carvalho interview). But you know what... keep believing infinite scaling is possible with zero or 1 sat/byte fees forever."
"> Satoshi created the white paper, yes. But Bitcoin and the world has changed drastically since then

Nobody cares about your ""world"", whatever that is.

I believe in a world without banks (or with powerless banks), and only real Bitcoin by Satoshi Nakamoto can achieve that, not some 1MB bullshit shitcoin, supported with censorship, narrative control, propaganda and psychological projection.

> This is the power of Roger Ver

I do not care who Roger Ver is, I do not know him, he is just a guy.

I don't care about Jihan.

I care only about the code. 

And you are an obvious shill. There has been a sudden increase of brigading to this sub, I noticed.

Because that was trying to be done without community consensus and would've been a horrible precedent to set in terms of how to change bitcoin rules. Roger Ver will get every change he ever wants to BCH because BCH will collapse without his propaganda and business machine and mining businesses backing it up. He is incredibly powerful in the world of BCH. That is scary and should be shunned at every opportunity.
"It's not heavily centralized that's a narrative created by Core because they basically cannot defend BTC against the fact it's no longer actually Bitcoin. Core has much more power over their chain, than individual miners have over Bitcoin Cash; and they're using that power to ruin it.

Check [these pie charts](https://i.imgur.com/FNOIQwJ.png). Can you tell which coin each one is? Now, how many independent teams are deciding what will be implemented in the reference client in the Core network? Just **one**. And how many on the Cash network? Definitely **more** than on.

But anyway, according to the white paper:

> [The system   is   secure   as   long   as   honest   nodes   collectively   control   more   CPU   power   than   any cooperating group of attacker nodes.](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)

So there you go, ""enough"" is >50% ."
Stellar argument. 
It's like talking to Eddie Bravo trying to convince him the earth is round. Carry on brother.
No, this is how consensus works. Everyone gets whatever rules they want. It's only if they agree on the same rules that they're working together, but people aren't required to work together. The only thing Roger Ver has authority over is the bitcoin.com wallet so anyone who doesn't like him can just use a different wallet, there are lots of choices.
You misspelled bcash
"Look, this was a narrative created by Roger Ver because he basically cannot defend BCH against the fact it is heavily centralized so instead he changed the narrative to - ""decentralization is not a goal, you only need enough decentralization to avoid censorship resistance"". But who or what decides what ""enough"" decentralization is? "

"What you guys fail to realize is that, irrespective to the size of the block, one needs only the block header to verify the POW and to mine the next block.

And he said that the connections used were 30Mbps. "
Graphene.
With Xthin (already on BCH) or Graphene (proposed) the size drops significantly, since the other nodes probably already have the transactions.
"First, I'm sorry you lost money, I don't wish this not even to people who think differently than me.

I wouldn't blame Roger Ver for that, I watched the video, he was talking about fiat withdraws/deposits, the bitcoin fraud occurred months later, not related to the fiat deposits/withdraw delays.

Have you thought about the fact that if you launch a proprietary software, it will be cracked and distributed for free?

Or that anything you can do on top of BTC can be done on top of BCH?

The average fee for BCH is wrong because wallets like trezor and ledger nano, and exchanges, charge a much higher fee than what is needed to transact, by default. If you transact using 1 sat/B ~ 0.005 usd you have your transaction included in the next block. Don't believe me, test yourself using electron cash. Soon we will have a feature that allows for 0.1 sat/B."

Doesn't really apply here. Remember who the blockstream investors are.

"That's actually what Core did. They failed to understand the original whitepaper and imitated mesh network architecture in their ignorance of modern small-world network theory. 

Bitcoin Cash is the only one that understands and follows the original design laid out in the whitepaper. Core never grasped the basics yet claims to have ""learned more since Satoshi."" Just like every other altcoin. BCH, the original Bitcoin, is going to zoom past them all."

"SegWit adoption is indeed slow. The thing is that most of those recent bulls don't care about the fees. With a median transaction value of 2k people don't even notice a fee of <1%. That's why they don't bother using SegWit (they haven't even heard of it).

"Just like the real world.  You have a business dispute.  You can walk away with the loss of money to the thief or you can hire a lawyer and attempt to recover the funds.  This makes no sense for small transactions.  So LN is not trustless for small transactions.   LN is not practical for large transactions, because then channels would have to be prefunded with huge transactions.  So what's the point?  Perhaps there is a middle range of transaction size where LN is practical, but this market can be instantly erased if the layer 1 providers simply increase their blocksize and lower the transaction fees.

I haven't read a single comment here from someone who has even the most remote idea how lightning works, just paranoia and bullshit. The volume of misinformation here is far too much to even begin to rebuke. Lighting exposes users to no counterparty risk. Fact. The explanation is literally in the OP.
Watching, however vigilant, is not enough.  When the watcher notices something, muscle is required to enforce.  Muscle costs fees.
Let's say your $5 is stolen. Are you going to post a cryptographic proof that it was stolen on chain if $5 fee transactions don't even go through?
Yeah, I guess it's ok if you need to move $10M million worth of coins. But there won't be any real use at these fees. Even the current fees made many businesses drop BTC.

"Ha.  The guys that built ripple incorporated workable ideas from finance and assumed the right incentives.  

Core/Blockstream/LN...  Not so much. "
"Yes, mining is an absolutely brilliant incentive that Core has never understood. It drives 

- decentralization and security (through competition, not 0% hashpower ""full nodes"")

- adherence the important protocol rules (through the Keynesian beauty contest of block hashpower voting)

- network topology (as miners are incentivized to connect to every other active miner in a nearly complete ring, and to deprioritize connections to nodes that never mine a block)

Plus, as you hint at, the miners have the incentive to jealously guard the main chain and its scalability so that fees don't go elsewhere (an incentive that grows with each halving). This means co-option attempts like LN (for anything by microtransactions) and sidechains are rejected.

Bitcoin Cash wins by understanding and embracing the mining network, the original design that neither Core nor any altcoin has ever comprehended."

The simplest answer *is* the most obvious: 0conf is not secure, so simply *manage the risk* when you use it - you won't need payment channels and watchdog services and strange convoluted fee-expensive patches that, at the end of the day, pass off the risk management responsibility to a third party."

"Yes, segwit and schnorr signatures will increase transaction throughput, but not by the many orders of magnitude that are going to be required for a global proof of work system to function.

Yes, the 133MB is a speculation that assumes every single transaction is going through LN, and that everyone only ever needs to make 3 transactions a year. Those assumptions are already insanely optimistic and only work if everyone is getting paid through LN and never moving money outside the system.

There's also a huge problem of pushing adoption. How long has segwit been availiable? Yet the adoption is still shit.

No matter how you draw up the numbers, bitcoin isn't going to scale very far with 1MB block sizes. Even with segwit, schnorr signatures, and LN."

"First up, day traders *not* running arbitrage pull their funds out of exchanges and put them back in again at least once per day. People don’t like leaving significant sums of money on a crypto exchange for fairly obvious reasons.

Secondly, when running arbitrage effectively you have to be able to transfer funds between exchanges. You won’t generally get the freakishly happy scenario where two exchanges keep flip-flopping in value. So you have to move money in a circle depositing fiat and withdrawing bitcoin from one exchange while depositing bitcoin and withdrawing fiat on the other. That sort of activity undoubtedly creates significant transaction volume."

As a lightning network/flash channels supporter, I am very curious to see your work. Will it be a paper or an application? Where are you going to publish it?
by who?
He needs to prove that he did first.  He is making the claim, negatives cannot be proven.

off chain transactions are fucking stupid
"When a transaction happens on Bitcoin, the P2P transaction is broadcast to the network and miners confirm the transaction. When a transaction happens on LN, miners will still need to confirm that transaction, but before miners can confirm the transaction, LN needs to confirm the transaction. In order to open up a channel on LN, you must have X amount of Bitcoin, which at this moment, needs to be at a minimum above the Bitcoin blockchain transaction fee. Sure, there may be 100's or 1000's of transactions being confirmed in that one channel, but it still needs to be above the transaction fee. So if you are not the guy with enough Bitcoin to open and close channels, then you are relying on someone that does have enough Bitcoin to open and close the channels.

If you never deal directly on the blockchain, then you are now submitting your purchasing power to mercy of the Channel owner(s). "
"Dude, stfu already. go admit the big failure and fraud you are and increase the block size, in spite of the fact that everything preached over and over for years was that blocks shouldn't increase.

You are a bunch of circus professional clowns."
Common knowledge? You are obviously disingenuous.  I have seen it toted again and again that LN will solve all problems which is why we don't need a blocksize increase.  This is the most popular narrative on the censored forum /r/bitcoin  You are not even allowed to criticize LN there or you are banned.  Everyone said [segwit will solve the problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWvKMu7OYV4).  They said [the solution is Lightning](https://youtu.be/XdyIJ-BUPaU?t=30m38s). They said [Lightning was going to come soon and solve everything](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7ie12l/lightning_is_going_to_come_really_soon_i_cant/). They [said we have LN, we don't need bigger blocks, thats for lazy devs](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7n5sv5/the_anti_lightning_networksegwit_fud_is_getting/).  You really need to stop trolling.
"Welcome to the discussion then.  Your post has not been deleted.  You haven't been banned.  Feel free to try to moderate principles by playing ""both sides.""  You won't change them at all."
Miners will have to be paid to disallow stealing funds? I am fairly sure there are some very misaligned incentives in the LN design. 
"Single channels, also called state channels, are inherently bidirectional, always, UNLESS one side of the channel is completely fund depleted. The later opens up interesting attack vectors, btw.  

There is not such thing as an unidirectional channel, per say.  

Lightning's next topology level is the network, also called multihop. That configuration is also necessarily bidirectional, as it is composed of a series of bidirectional single channels."
Because no one wanted to spam the network hardcore to force a *flippening* before this year. Follow the money . Of course it's a bullshit conspiracy but someone has done it for some reason and this would be one.

"Where do you think the word idiot originates from?

Edit: from Wikipedia

>In 19th- and early 20th-century medicine and psychology, an ""idiot"" was a person with a very profound intellectual disability. In the early 1900s, Dr. Henry H. Goddard proposed a classification system for intellectual disability based on the Binet-Simon concept of mental age. Individuals with the lowest mental age level (less than three years) were identified as idiots; imbeciles had a mental age of three to seven years, and morons had a mental age of seven to ten years.[9] The term ""idiot"" was used to refer to people having an IQ below 30[citation needed][10][11] IQ, or intelligence quotient, was originally determined by dividing a person's mental age, as determined by standardized tests, by their actual age. The concept of mental age has fallen into disfavor, though, and IQ is now determined on the basis of statistical distributions.[12]

No you need the block to verify that the block is valid.  You can start mining with the header but if the block isn't valid then you're wasting hashing power.
and let us not forget about Adam Back, who wrote off Satoshi's prototype and never bothered mining only to resurface after the first bubble popped suddenly bitcoin's #1 fan.

Literally, the whole point of an open source projects it that anyone, for any reason can take whatever you've created and do whatever they want with it.
Usually you are not because the work spent in POW far outweighs the work of checking signatures, this is the essence of cryptography. So it would be a waste of time for the previous miner to spend POW in an invalid block, far more than your if you need to halt mining because when the signatures come they are not valid, this happens pretty fast. 
Thanks for clearing that up, retard.
Stop accusing and provide the proof.
I have read it probably 10x as many times as you have you little troll.  Its not common knowledge to your hordes of sheep followers over at BlockStream Core is it? Which is why you are so afraid of the truth getting out.
"The problem is that core wants as much decentralisation as possible and like 25% of nodes are running in areas wich have limited bandwith capacity. So the people living there are signalling that they are not ready for an increase yet. raising blocksize would turn of a lot of nodes and make the network less secure, thats why we should increase it when they are signalling that most of them are ready.

I would be ok with an increase myself but im not alone on the planet.

"LN creates a layered system where each layer has its own incentives, designed to prevent ""gaming"".  However, the nature of layered systems is such that there are subtle cross-layer interactions.  (We saw this between TCP and IP when it came to network congestion.)    So now we have cross-layer incentives and cross-layer gaming.

It's not a problem for idiots.  It's an opportunity for geniuses to exploit.  The advantage of flat, simple systems such as Bitcoin is that simplicity provides few(er) nooks and crannies in which to hide exploits.  The brilliance of Bitcoin comes from its stark simplicity which exploits underlying processing, storage and communications technology rather than clever algorithms which, most likely, represent an intellectual bridge too far.  That's what LN is:  **an intellectual bridge too far**.
"
I taught you something new about misplaced political correctness, you called me names. The internet has worked its beauty again.
"You also need the block to know which transactions were included in the block so you know which transactions not ti put in your block.  Otherwise the only truly safe way to publish a block on top of a block which you haven't been able to go through the transactions is to publish an empty block.

So if you have large blocks that take a long time to propagate miners will opt to publish empty blocks which undermines the entire system.

Even if validation of the transactions are quick you can't validate what you don't have"

"no, b/c it was economically not prudent to try a stupid spam attack when the blocksize LIMIT was well above avg blocksize; it was too expensive and had uncertain results.  now that blocks are full, it is easy to spam an already congested mempool if one wants to; not saying that is happening.  but if it was, how does that make the Bcore BTC strategy a good thing?   BTC should be immune to this type of attack and the solution is simple; restore a blocksize LIMIT well above 1MB and avg blocksize economic demand.  

you don't even have to evoke a spam conspiracy theory either; this congestion could simply be too much economic demand from BTC's popularity; again, this was foreseen by the big blockists years ago with the simple solution being a blocksize limit increase."

Except keys must be online to publish refund transactions.  You can be sure one of the aml/kyc conditions will be to enable access to the keys,  else you go to jail and the hub/node dies.

I'm back. Give me a moment.
"Even Joseph Poon, one of the two original LN guys, said LN would need hundred-megabyte blocks to work. He was blackballed by Core because Core is trying to use LN as a political hobby horse for their miniscule ""full blocks"" regime. I've yet to hear about an actual LN dev who thinks 1MB is even in the ballpark of acceptable.

So not only are Core supporters placing their faith in an system that no one has even been able to demonstrate works *even in concept*, they believe it can work with their micro-blocker ideals, which it can't. Add to that that it is all completely unnecessary as the whitepaper explains in Section 8, which they have read but not understood. What's that, triply broken?"

"Yeah because as the blocks fill the fees get giant.  So people could screw with the lightning network.  A hostile actor can close the channel and try to steal funds, and the only way to get your funds back is to broadcast on-chain and pay a huge fee.  These small blockers [advocate for $1000 fees per transaction](https://cointelegraph.com/news/ari-paul-tuur-demeester-look-forward-to-up-to-1k-bitcoin-fees).  So every time a hostile actor messes with you, you have to make a transaction costing $1000.  So this will inevitably lead to centralized hubs, [and LN has been proven to be centralized](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6jqrub/game_over_blockstream_mathematical_proof_that_the/), and [I link some sources showing that in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7n4pym/this_comment_i_just_made_explains_why_bitcoin/ds0gkvu/).  If your transaction gets stuck you aren't going to be able to recover the funds from the attacker.  It leads to huge security problems.  Governments can use it as an attack vector as well [as Jiang Zhouer says](https://cointelegraph.com/news/chinese-exchange-huobi-asks-bitcoin-core-expert-to-address-scaling-issues):

> LN [Lightning] will nurture monopoly LN processor like Alipay or Wechat Pay. By that time, the government could easily shut down the LN in the name of AML. Then the LN transaction will be transferred to the 1M mainnet, the 100x transaction demand will jam the network and soon the network will be paralyzed as well.”

Lightning has many issues and problems.  It is not a scaling solution."
Fees > closing costs is not a dead end state, as they can be payed through a direct or indirect on-chain tx.

Bcash is a band-aid fix that will run into the same problems as Bitcoin if it has the same amount of users. Centralised trash.
you realise that core will just increase block size with LN and BCH will be dead, right?
Yay!! Go core! Progress is happening!
/u/tippr gild
">Yet Core is deadset on deat setting Bitcoin. 

FTFY

Either they are 

- incompetent
- malicious 
- deceived 
"
I follow Rusty and the gang pretty much everywhere on the net. And when I say everywhere, I mean it. One thing became very clear to me: the LN developpers are without a shred of a doubt large blockers and they do not have any feeling but complete contempt towards Core and their policies. It is getting ugly. Where do you think the proposed 3rd layer comes from (partly)? Avoidance of on-chain fees (ie miners lunch).
"Came here to say this. It's not that they'll need _a_ block size increase it's that any time there is an on-chain backlog everyone using lightning will be at risk of the blockchain failing in its role as ""court"" or ""arbiter"" (her words).

They say they need a fee market to avoid degenerate selfish mining behaviors when the block reward drops, but on-chain fees will establish a floor below which it will literally cost you so much to prevent a lightning counterparty from stealing from you that it will not be worth your while. No one will be able to safely open a lightning channel unless it contains significantly more funds than whatever they anticipate the maximum fee to be during the lifetime of the channel.

Think about that.

EDIT: After posting this I realized that it costs bad actors on-chain fees to steal, which significantly reduces their incentive. I still don't see how lightning is compatible with high on-chain fees but the situation is not as bad as I initially thought."
"I've been asking this question for weeks on /r/bitcoin and on other Bitcoin forums and no one will address it. If the BTC fees are larger than what you gain by acting as a hub there is no way securely process the transaction. 

This means LB can only make payments of values much larger than the current BTC transaction fee and lower than the amount locked away in the smallest channel along your path.

The white paper itself suggests 133MB blocks, but everyone downvotes on /r/bitcoin if you mention that."
"Seriously, you have been against LN all this time and you only just finding out how it works?

Have you ever read the whitepaper?"
The problem is not LN, the problem is that Segwit is still not supported in a lot of merchants and wallets. Its going to be 6 months soon since Bitcoin was updated to use Segwit. I hope they did the right thing.
90% chance the crypto of the future hasnt even come out yet, I'll hold out instead of hopping on BTrash
It doesn't necessarily break the whole thing. It just means there's a need for a good low-cost settlement layer (ie BCH).
"It doesn't though. The original transaction that's been agreed to has a fixed fee. So the malicious actor would have to pay acceleration fees off the blockchain to accelerate their transaction in case of a full mempool.

In response, the person who is attacked can simply pay the going rate for a quick transaction, and they in turn receive BOTH sides of the lightning network channel. In this case the attacker loses both their acceleration fees (generally higher than a simple high fee transaction) and the entire value of their side of the channel.

This does impose some constraints on the channels, namely that they maintain enough value on both sides to make an attack unprofitable, but even if it were to become technically possible, the attacker is still risking far more than the attacked.

It's not some new revelation, it's been discussed in detail over the last few years."
"It's now obvious that it was due to spam:
https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#24h

Seems like some hostile actor needed the ""congrested meme pool"" argument, so he just flooted it. I wonder who that could be hmmmm...."
*yawn* a discussion amongst a thoroughly sanitised group of Core developers. I have no idea how it is going to end. Fool.
Nobody is advocating unlimited block size.  You may actually be surprised that Bitcoin Cash has been using proper academic and practical studies on what works...  Unlike core. 
"> Now the real question is. Why did some like myself waste their time posting in this echo-chamber?

Because uncensored discussion is real discussion, and you wanted to get a word in *where it counts*."
Think exhausted channels. It will be miners' field day. A very, very low cost to collect those juicy fees.
[deleted]
"> Blockchain serves as the ledger under everything that allows people to recover from bad actors without loss.

You lose the fees. Core is arguing for high fees. How is Game Theory going to help with that? Oh wait I know, only open channels with counterparties you trust...

EDIT: see my edit below. Your game theory argument is stronger than I initially thought."
so you have no actual arguemtns?
"I think it is more along these lines: look how stupid and unfeasible LN is, and it is the only hope bitcoin has, I’m glad I converted my
Btc to BCH.  Serves to protect against cognitive dissonance I guess."
"Can you explain this a bit more fully? 

When using exchanges my buy/sell orders are obviously off-chain. But deposits and withdrawals are not. Day traders and people running arbitrage between exchanges pull money in and out of the exchanges multiple times a day. So that whole quite substantial chunk of the transaction load could be reduced with just a very minimal adoption of a relatively basic LN."
False, as there are parallel ways to finance or rebalance a channel, but LN is fucked in the current situation anyways. Same conclusion.
I think that would be channels less than $30 not transactions. Of course no one’s going to be opening $30 channels because of the fees...
Because they only used LN as the excuse not to increase it.  The real reason they don't want to is [more nefarious](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7d02ee/some_thoughts_about_the_possible_bitcoin_segwit/).
You are onto something friend. Hint: miners. Stay tuned.
Right, people will need to manually monitor 24/7 or use third party apps that will eventually get written to do it for you. With all the bugs they will have, adding a new layer of complexity.
they never said that.
Good for you. Ask Rusty -Blockstream full time employee - if he is a big blocker or not.
That's not how it works. You can only claim all the funds in the channel if you publish a period that the other party is trying to cheat by attempting to redeem an old state of the channel. If they took your node offline and demanded coinbase close the channel it would close in its current state with tbe last tx you both signed. 
I don't get what you mean. The transaction to close the channel must be signed by both parties, and both parties have a copy of the latest transaction ready to go at all times, including fees. In your example, no transaction exists that gives all of your funds to coinbase, so how could they unilaterally take them?
New few years lol. LN by 2025 is optimistic.
It can't work on cash. It needs segwit. 
There will actually be excellent applications for LN on BCH, but only at the single channel level. Forget about the network part.
I’m pretty sure you guys are either stupid or bad actors.  
"No legitimate, progressive Bitcoin supporter is against bigger blocks. LN will require this. The question is when, not if.

What we CAN'T do is give in to a conglomerate of businesses trying to do segwit2x without consensus or the backing of Core (and that goes both ways). It must be done the right way, which is with careful planning and the backing of everyone in the Bitcoin community (or at least the large majority of it). That being said, I think a blocksize increase up to 8mb is completely fine if we get consensus, but this idea of unlimited blocksize that BCH is championing is complete nonsense. Blocksize increases should require meticulous, well thought out discussion and analysis by professionals (not us peasants on a bch subreddit) that the community can get behind.

And just to add about the title, which is absurdly misleading (nowhere does she mention nor imply that a blocksize increase would be needed for this particular scenario) you will have to close a channel, yes. But you would also be given the user's funds if they try to fraud you. "
"Don't bother looking at the most cursory information on the topic.  This is by design. Game Theory, it's how the thing works. 

As usual this place attempts to re-characterise benign information as conspiracy, preaching poor quality ""analysis"" at the choir.

This penalty transaction broadcast is the entire point. Blockchain serves as the ledger under everything that allows people to recover from bad actors without loss.

Won't work without block size increases? You see millions of bad actors throwing away their money? That's a very strange conclusion, not based at all in reality.

That said, if you read the roadmaps you'll see block size increases are part of the scaling plan, all these things are part of the puzzle. 

Now the real question is. Why did some like myself waste their time posting in this echo-chamber?

"
"Yo wtf, this bitch retarded or something? Didn’t she say also some shit like: “Yes of course, we will have LN running in about 6 months” .. like two fuckin years ago?!

Who are these brainstem devoid cultists that still eat this nonsense up? What will it take to get these extra chromosome ringleaders to pull a Heaven’s Gate conclusion?

Getting tired of this bullshit already. What is even their goal anymore? Truly forever being a store of value for tax evading/money laundering banks/fund corporations?"
Truth core don't want you to know. 
"For a computer scientist, a system is secure if there is a mathematical proof that it cannot fail, or at least a mathematical proof that the probability of failure is less than X% for some very small X.  (That, for example, is what Satoshi proved for the reversal of 6-confirmed transactons.)

For a computer/software engineer, a system is secure if there is empirical data about the components and an empirically validated usage model from which one can conclude that the probability of failure is less than X%, for very small X.  (That, for example, is how engineers can build computers that do billions of complex computations per second, for years nonstop, without a single failure.)

For a hacker (in the good sense of the word), a system is secure if there is a way that enables the author, or someone as knowledgeable as him, to avoid some failures, some of the time.  (That, for example, is the sense in which RBF ""solved"" the problem of stuck transactions in Bitcoin Core.)

The bidirectional payment channels, that are supposed to be the building block of the LN, are secure only in the hackers' sense."
"Add it to the list.

I'm more worried about the collusion-theft vector:

----

Alice has a channel with Bob. They're both funded and the channel is working just fine. Bob pays Charlie a small fee to monitor his channel with Alice and broadcast the punishment transaction if Alice tries to cheat. Bob goes out of town for the night, secure in his knowledge that Charlie is being paid to watch his channel in his absence.

Charlie, unbeknownst to Bob, is actually Alice's old friend and business partner, and also operates a significant mining operation. This is an independent operation that he keeps separate from his monitoring services, but does have the ability to influence the mempool of those miners arbitrarily. Alice provides Charlie with one of her closure transactions, and offers to pay Charlie treble his usual fee to maliciously close the channel.

Charlie takes the money and pushes the theft transaction to his miners, *without notifying the rest of the network or broadcasting the transaction*. The transaction isn't seen publicly - only to his private miners - so his watchdog service is *totally unaware of the theft attempt*. Charlie has overnight (the life of the channel) to attempt to mine that transaction; his success has a financial incentive; and, Bob is powerless to detect or prevent the attack. He wakes up in the morning, comes back into town, and discovers that Alice has closed his channel and Charlie didn't earn his pay - or doesn't, if Charlie's miners were unlucky, *and is none the wiser*."

So transactions less than $30 are not secure in the Lightning Network because getting them back would be left up to chance.
Why didn't they increase it already if they're going to have to anyway? They could have avoided the fork but they didn't! This is one of the things I understand the least about BS.
Don't forget exhausted channel attacks, which could be profitable even if the channel is not exhausted given they could get away with enough of them.

"Now core wants to copy us to scale on chain?? LMAO

Now that's the proof of the absolute fraud they are, years preaching that the block size should be limited to 1MB, some even saying less than this.

"Because of this, your private key does not have to be compromised to confiscate your funds.

1. Govt issues a warrant for your Lightning node & confiscates the machine

2. Govt issues a demand to your channel partner (ie Coinbase) to close its channel with you

3. Your node is offline, all the funds in the channel go to Coinbase, who gives funds to govt

Nobody had to even use rubber hose cryptography or crack your key."

They are no where near a solution and might never be.

> I think we just have to leave this for the network to resolve. Since we don't have any off chain solutions out there yet, it makes more sense the community build a consensus to change the network in such a way as to reduce the fees while **these off chain solutions like Lightning are fully fleshed out and adopted over the next few years.**

"Yeah there's just no way LN will work on Core. It might work on Cash but then what's the point? When I look at my own finances I pay a small handful of companies regularly and many once a year or less. So I'm expected to predict in advance how much I'll spend with the regular ones, have the funds available up front and lock them in to a channel for a year? And if I underestimate I get hammered with another astronomical blockchain fee?

For me, Bitcoin was beautiful and elegant and so obviously trustless right from the start. LN is ugly and complicated and it's unclear if it's trustless. That's enough for me to not put my money anywhere near it."
LN opening, closing, and revocation tx's make no sense with a congested mempool. 
Wow, this breaks the whole thing, LN sucks even more than I thought.
"
Oh you want access to your Bitcoin right now? Tired of paying high fees? You wamt merchant adoption? TOO BAD!!  Big blocks are terrible and evil when you want them!!  Signed, the self proclaimed ""best developers in the world"""

You know, way back when.... I seriously fucking believed these people. 
Can you give any details about why this means LN won't work without a block size limit increase? It's not obvious how providing a cryptographic proof (like a hash) would do that.
How hilarious will it be when not only do rising fees de facto confiscate money by making utxo's unspendable, they also make bidirectional channels unenforceable because fees > amounts locked in channels! Also going to be great when this goes live, and moving fees causes every single refund or revocation tx to require CPFP, because the fees they're signed against are continuously obsolete!
"Perhaps more to the point, LN wouldn't work (even in principle) with full blocks. Yet Core is deadset on full blocks. That means LN cannot be a solution for any Core supporter. 

Anyone who thinks BTC can solve its massive fee problems without forking away from Core is dreaming, and anyone who wakes up from this dream will realize the fork away from Core has already happened: it's called Bitcoin Cash. "
Perfect thumbnail. She's like: trolololo!
Yeah I have read the whitepaper and researched it deeply, and [the narrative around it is a complete fraud](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7n4pym/this_comment_i_just_made_explains_why_bitcoin/ds0gkvu/), which you are well aware, because I just checked your posts and you admitted that malleability fix was never needed for LN.  I am just educating the mass community about these issues, since censorship and propaganda have really brainwashed people.
Why are we still talking about lightning? Holy fuck.
The LN will be released with huge fanfare but then will have almost nobody using it, just like Segwit. To have such energy behind an inherently flawed idea.. I fell bad for her. :/
What a doofus
The first sentence is true. The second is false.
The best solution would to make BCH ready for LN, so when (and if) LN ever does come out, it will work best on BCH.   This will make all the Core fanboi's who have been cheering LN for years realize which is the best protocol!
Satoshi must be fuming watching this woman ruin Bitcoin.  
"I don't think the people in this sub will ever get sick of willfully misinterpreting clear english to sensational and dramatic ends. It's like you heard ""if Alice steals Bob's funds, Bob can simply resolve to the blockchain to recover his funds. There is no counterparty risk"" but stopped listening at ""Alice steals Bob's funds"" and immediately had to start screaming to the world ""Lighting allows Alice to steal Bob's funds!"""
The whitepapaper stated a blocksize increase was needed. 
"I am not sure why people have conveniently forgotten that LN does not require BTC. In fact it is currently live for both BTC AND LTC. It is also a perfectly viably option for BCH.

LN is a channel to transfer existing Crypotocurrencies via smart transactions using a network chain. If it is something that people want to use, it could be used by many cryptocurrencies. It does not solve the problems with BTC, it just works as a tool to circumvent them."
Your initial thought is perfect and your Edit is wrong. Miners will be able to wreck havoc on LN network. Like a dog on a bowling alley. Stay tuned we are working on a paper. Perhaps more to the point, LN wouldn't work (even in principle) with full blocks. Yet Core is deadset on full blocks. That means LN cannot be a solution for any Core supporter. 
What does this mean for Litecoin?
So they made a tipbot. except it is worse than the tippr bot. what am i missing here guys?
Nooooo... Reallyyyyy???? It’s soooooo bad that after all this time you have to accept big blocks as an imposed necessity...
LOL
poor lady.  stuck selling a product that i think she doesnt truly believe in.
The current number of Lightning threads on the front page tells me that some people are probably a tiny little bit afraid of Lightning succeeding. 
"That's not what she said at all...I'm starting to wonder (well, not starting: it's pretty clear) if you lot just hear what you want to hear, rather than critically listen to the content of these speakers. Also, this was posted months ago, this is old news. 

The LN transactions are time-locked and use smart contracts to determine where the funds are at. Both parties must sign for any further changes: when one party leave the channel, they can only take the funds that have been authorized on both sides of the channel, and must wait until the expiration window closes for the other party to respond. This is what she said...there will be no stealing of funds because both parties would have to sign onto the theft, which then is no longer a theft. "
"My read of lightning is that you open a channel with funds in it.   If u disagree with the other side of the channel (like if they try to claim more belongs to them) then u have to broadcast the dispute to the blockchain.   That's fine as long as it's cheap to broadcast.  But if a transaction is expensive the whole thing falls apart because it is expensive to take the dispute ""to court"" bc even if you win u still have to pay several transaction fees to dispute and close one channel and open another.   Also the dispute can tie up all of your channel funds for days.    I'm skeptical."
LN is going to be a disaster
Well in the meantime all of the stores in the area that want to accept Lightning payments could start a shared paper tab. /s
Anonymous will destroy the Lightning Network.
Jeeze. listening to her makes me want to stab my eardrums. At least hire someone who can talk properly. 
"The majority of bitcoin transactions at least 99% are moving funds to an from exchanges or mining pools. Bitcoin exchanges already use a second layer solution for trading ( its basically tabs ). Obviously bitcoin exchanges and mining pools cannot use the LN, anyone who claims they some how will are fucken idiots  - who probably got into bitcoin for the money and blindly supports whats currently being brigadded in r/bitcoin. 

So basically, the LN only applies to 1% ( decreasing) payment use cases of bitcoin, so people shouldn't expect fee's to get lower even with FULL LN adoption. "
Even if it works fine, it will take months (years?) until it's ready and than another >1year until people use it. Even the core wallet iroincally doesn't hvave segwit (by default).
Let that sink in for a while. You get downvotes for mentioning the freaking white paper in an internetforum which claims to be about Bitcoin!
lol conbase
"Well and that's totally arbitrary:

> If all transactions using Bitcoin were conducted inside a network of
micropayment channels, to enable 7 billion people to make two channels
per year with unlimited transactions inside the channel, it would require
133 MB blocks

Two channels per year? That's not even remotely reasonable without a hub-and-spoke topology."
And if the third party is offline or malfunction and can't watch your channels you're fucked.

Well that is just payment channels, no? Yours.org is already doing them.
Yeah, single one-way channels have many applications. Two-way channels are only necessary when you have an application where your money moved across the channel is much higher than the settlement amount at the end. Who the hell does that? Some people do that kind of thing with people they trust, but if they trust them then this whole thing is pointless. I really can't think of an application where the other party is someone you don't already trust.
"Even if I agreed with your spam claim, which I don't, how is BTC being susceptible to a simple spam attack a good thing?

Pro tip ; spam was never an issue prior to July 2015 "
ummm how exactly does your link prove a spam argument? All it shows is the mempool stats with strata for satoshi/byte fees. There's nothing here that I can see that shows one actor doing something nefarious.
It seems like LN users have to rely on on-chain transactions for safety and security. With on-chain transactions so slow, expensive and unreliable, that's a big disadvantage.
yeah but since bch doesn't disable the opcodes like core, there is no need for LN when it comes to multisig escrow payment situations. LN could work as an opt-in regulated layer that exchanges company/bank IOUS around that have FDIC insurance like fiat though i suppose 
"Even with a fast ""settlement"" layer, the LN still needs punishment transactions and Watchers, and every LN user must promptly notify their Watcher of any LN payment that she makes."
"You're being generous. I think it effectively breaks the whole thing for all but a tiny niche of use cases and only assuming an underlying blockchain which rarely if ever has high fees.

I think the future looks like this: one or a small number of highly secure, relatively price-stable blockchains with very large blocks which have been optimized up the wazoo (decades of R&D). On top of that, centralized services which can - if you choose to trust them - transact on your behalf for a fee.

And there is nothing wrong with that. As long as the bottom layer is trustless and decentralized the true ills of corrupt control of monetary supply will be banished."
"But still the Watcher needs to get the punishment transaction confirmed within the freeze window.  If the network is congested and it costs $100 of fee to get confirmation in that time, then there will be situations when the fraudster can reverse payments worth $90, because the victim would get even less money if he tried to punish.   And of course there is no guarantee that a $100 fee will get the punishment confirmed in due time.

Moreover, the Watcher must be promptly notified of any LN payment made through the channel; and he must be paid a periodic fee for as long as the channel remains open, even if it has not been used for months."
Trust in third party services... Just what we needed.

"I skipped to the part when it says:

This statement reeks of logical fallacies 
Microsoft have shown nearly zero technical competence in the last 30 years. They make money not technical solutions. This is like their claim to cure spam mail, nothing but marketing BS.
Decentralised identity is fake news.  How many people do you know use one?  Nope, it's centralised into openid providers, like facebook, google, twitter.
Your post is full of ad hominem roger ver attack, empty microsoft shill and plain lies. You talk like roger ver is the tech guy behind the research, which is false. You talk like microsoft has the best devs in the world and has some killer app, another falsity, Lastly, there is no decentralized, secure, altcoin with cheaper fees than BCH, just another false claim.
"And yet Core can't even concede to a 2MB fork and avoid all of footholds they've given to the enemies of ""Bitcoin."" Where is the math on 2MB causing irreparable centralization?

I don't think you understand open source if you thought they could maintain dominance while changing the code from what we all bought into before Core or Segwit existed."
Yes, we all heard of it, but they still have to increase it, they don't have a choice, otherwise they're on a way to a cliff everyone can see is coming.
BU is an organization that maintains a node implementation for both the BTC and BCH blockchains.
"And that's why LN won't work. A user has two options

1) Use bitcoin and lock his funds into LN channel (s), where each channel costs him a transaction fee to open, to close,  to add funds, and to resolve conflicts. The fees are projected to be $100-1000, and maybe higher, considering we saw many $100+ fees already for complex transactions, and exchanges regularly pay $1000+ fees for batched withdrawals.

2) use some other coin with cheap or free on-chain transactions 

And can you imagine the UI complexity for the LN? Who is going to use it? People refuse to use desktop Linux, which isn't too bad now."
"There still would be no need for LN.   Day traders running arbitrage between exchanges just have to keep lots of funds on both exchanges and that will minimize the number of transactions they make.  The situation is not fundamentally different with LN.  (More money tied up means need for fewer transactions.)

The target market for payment channels (or any other prepaid system) comes where there is a small ratio in cost between the value being moved in a transaction compared to the cost of making a transaction on the layer 1 network.  Since actual cost of a transaction on a properly configured and provisioned layer 1 network is well under $0.01 USD, there is no point in even thinking of applying LN to the arbitrage case.
"
Dude a floppy disk from the 80s is 1.44mb. a webpage is 3-5mb. And we check a lot of webpages in 10mins. 1mb blocks per 10min just doesn't make any sense 
I know that the Core kool-aid is flavorful, but it is also deceptive. This is an untruth - big blocks do *not* induce centralization (and the mechanism by which it is claimed to do so, already exists today in the form of ASICs).
"Small blocks are centralizing Bitcoin mining in China by making mining only a function of electricity, rather than electricity and network connectivity. 

Small blocks are centralizing Bitcoin mining in general as well, because they limit adoption which limits the rate at which new miners enter the industry. 

Small blocks are centralizing Bitcoin for no reason, because non-mining full clients don't help decentralize the Bitcoin network in any way. Bitcoin is a *mining* network. That's what the whole whitepaper is about if you actually read it. ""Nodes"" that don't mine are only mentioned once in the whitepaper: for merchants who want to accept 0-conf. Not for helping the network. This was an idea added later by people who never understood the whitepaper, who thought Section 8 meant the exact opposite of what it means because they read it out of context, cluelessly thinking ""overpowered by an attacker"" referred to a majority hashpower attacker when it quite clearly refers to a minority hashpower attacker. 

That is why Satoshi wrote in the original readme.txt: 

>To support the network by running a node, select:

>Options->Generate Coins

"
"that's such a beautiful boogie man they came up with to scare everyone so they could lead everyone on forever with promises of LN glory while you gleefully cheer on Bitcoin stagnation 

3 years preventing **any** progress on Bitcoin but somehow you believe raising the block size will ""cause centralization""

but sure, let's all ignore the centralization elephant in the room of a single group dictating the only ""choice"" you have to ""scale"" Bitcoin 

edit: this is just fucking gold.  I now have distractions below about ""it will be raised later"" and ""nobody said it would never be raised"".  but somehow raising the block size now against the will of a single group will somehow destroy Bitcoin ""decentralization""

the cognitive dissonance is appalling"
We get that that is how it is designed to work. What's under discussion are circumstances where an attacker could use full blocks/high fees to circumvent the design.
I'm looking forward to your paper. My initial idea was about general users, not miners. So I think my edit should stand.
Stop fapping and get publishing!
"Not just miners but large BTC hodlers who want BCH to succeed because they see this as an opportunity to ride a BCH wave up all over again as they did with BTC. By virtue of the fact they still have  alot of BTC (they hedged towards BCH without taking a stupid risk to dump all their BTC in one reckless move), they can afford to literally lock up the BTC mainchain with spam repeatedly ; and do it for months at a time because they can afford it. All just to severely disrupt or kill LN with the goal to drive the value of their BCH. They will do this, I can assure you. "
"I agree that's a legitimate attack vector but it's not the attack I was describing. I made a dumb, late night math mistake. We get accused of lying & whatnot; I want to make sure our arguments are airtight so I stand by my edit."
">Although it is more expensive to do this when blocks are full of transactions that are laying very high fees,

You almost got this right. Please see GCBU where this attack was already laid out in detail over a year ago. The spammer does not have to pay higher fees when blocks are already almost full ; all he has to do is fill up the lower fee portion of the already congested mempool with small fee tx's that threaten to take up data space towards the 1mb cap which causes further congestion in the mempool to drive the overall fees much higher. His spam also never has to pay ANY fees as it just rolls off the mempool approximately 2wk down the line from being unconfirmed. "
"Here's a direct quote from the white paper.

> If all transactions using Bitcoin were conducted inside a network of
micropayment channels, to enable 7 billion people to make two channels
per year with unlimited transactions inside the channel, it would require
**133 MB blocks** (presuming 500 bytes per transaction and 52560 blocks per
year). Current generation desktop computers will be able to run a full node
with old blocks pruned out on 2TB of storage.
"
No, I don't think that is correct. The issue here is for a single transaction. If you are a node somewhere in the middle of a transaction, the next node in line can decide to not pay you the 10 cents. You have no way to know if its malicious or if they are simply offline. The only way to force them to pay you that 10 cents is to broadcast that specific transaction on the blockchain and close the channel. In this scenario, it doesn't matter how much liquidity the channel has, if the transaction fee is 11 cents to broadcast to the blockchain you will have spent more than you gained.
"LN (and it's whitepaper) has nothing to do with Bitcoin Core and is a second layer solution.

Having said that, nowhere in the LN whitepaper (which is obsolete, [the RFC](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc) contains several improvements) are 133MB blocks suggested. 133MB blocks are mentioned instead in a hypothetical calculation of world adoption where every single person on earth would have channels open. Again, that whitepaper is 2 years old. Now with on-chain scaling solutions like Segregated Witness and probably schnorr signatures in the near future that requirement would be much lower."
"> Yeah I have read the whitepaper and researched it deeply,

Then why is this a surprise to you?

It goes extensively into it in the whitepaper along with estimates as to what block size increases we need.

It's not hidden, there is no great revelation apart from for ignorant people like yourself that haven't even don't the basics of research into the things you hate."

I just told you. Stop apologising.
What argument? Everyone here is willfully misinterpreting plain english which can be observed by simply transcribing the content. What is there to argue about?
Explain, let's say I send $5 in a transaction and someone steals my funds in the LN. How do I get that money back if $5 fee transactions may never confirm?
Watch other videos of Peter Rizun, talking about segwit. Also, watch Amaury Séchet videos.
Let me know when they've resolved the LN scaling problem. 
No way, Greg is popping champaign. 
Core will lose all credibility and trust if they do that - which they're already not doing to well in.  BCH will be fine.
wat? no, that's about as far from the truth as it can get.
Block size increase is just a quick fix that centralizes the coin more. It doesn't solve anything permanently.
It doesn't cost the bad actor, it costs an actor that didn't get paid since they are the one broadcasting the transaction... Right?
Brainwashed ^ 
Why would you pay to protect a channel when fees exceed the value in the channel? This breaks down the game theory incentives of the bidirectional channel.
Its almost like they purposely made an attack vector.
"To quote the de facto leader of Core, Gregory Maxwell, ""Segwit **is** the blocksize increase."" 

Imagine how much face would be lost if they had to ape BCH and increase the raw blocksize because Segwit failed. And remember, Maxwell - whose single email became Core's roadmap - is ""popping the champagne"" (his words) to celebrate the current absurdly high fees. 

You really think he's gonna want to increase blocksize and rain on that champagne party? Also recall that he cofounded a company that employs or contracts with many of the key Core devs and got $100 million in venture capital (aiming for a 10x return, as is typical in the VC world) based solely on a business plan that aims to keep the BTC chain crippled (in its cacacity *and* its opcodes) while offering those same capabilities offchain.

BCH is the only ticket off the S.S. Core-tanic. "
Do you feel embarrassed not being able to articulate even one reasonable argument? 
"Exactly, if the fee is 1000 dollars, then it means any channel must contain at least 2000 dollars, for Alic/Bob to have motivation to close the channel (using all the funds from the counterparty to pay for the fee) . That means a channel must be as big as 2000 dollars, totally out of reach of most of the users

In fact, this ""punishing"" mechanism is so ugly thus I doubt it is a result of a flawed design: When a design has fundamental security loophole, people will use many strange patches trying to cover that hole, but they can not totally eliminate the problem from the root, just moved it from one area to another

Traditionally, in a payment channel, both party must agree on a single point of truth (the current balance of each user), and that truth can only be decided by the trusted authority, thus it is always a centralized model

LN is trying to achieve the same single point of truth without relying on a trusted authority, it is like making a perpetual motion machine, I don't think that is achievable theoretically, thus you see they are making all sorts of strange mechanisms similar to those strange designs you see in a perpetual motion machine prototype"
It doesn't cost them only on-chain fees. It costs them *all* their funds in the channel.
"Main dev team of LN is Blockstream bro....

Copy paste from their own wiki page:

Developer(s)	
- Elements Project (Blockstream)
- Lightning Labs
- ACINQ"
Your initial thought is perfect and your Edit is wrong. Miners will be able to wreck havoc on LN network. Like a dog on a bowling alley. Stay tuned we are working on a paper.
"But wait: you can simply _trust_ the lightning hub. I mean, Bank of America is a trustworthy institution, right?

/s "
Nah man. The No2X movement is too strong. Core will never hard fork to bigger blocks. That ship has sailed
Good. But BCH was created and continues to increase in value and adoption because every attempt at increasing the BTC blocksize so far has been prevented. It would be a radical and unexpected change for Blockstream and their backers to allow a block size increase just because lightning needs it.
No it won't. You're just repeating Blockstream propaganda without any technical fact as to WHY.
"sure, when core finally does an about-face and recognizes they've been wrong about blocksize, everyone continues following them, in recognition of their terrific leadership.  

but sure, assume that to be the most likely outcome. also, go on and assume that LN will actually be deployed. 


"
"To your edit: it *is* as bad as you initially thought, because those looking to loot the system en mass can just launch an (actual) spam attack right after they do the stealing transaction. It is essentially impossible to do that to a network where blocks aren't anywhere near being full, but it is easy with one where full blocks are a design goal, since there is only a tiny margin between demand and the cap you need to fill with extra transactions. Although it is more expensive to do this when blocks are full of transactions that are laying very high fees, it is a pittance compared to what can be gained by a single big hub (remember big hubs are OK to LN supporters since ""you can just switch"") stealing from every single user using the hub."
Corrolary: BCH will integrate the LN when it's complete and will do everything BTC does only cheaper with bigger blocks.  And you don't need SegWit, segregated witness can be implemented more cleanly as a HF (which BCH does), or other tx malleability fixes can be used.
"Hostile actor, prediction: it will be miners, who will then have any and all incentives to collect those juicy funds.  

Miners truly protect the main chain in more ways than anyone has ever imagined."
The LN will be just like Ripple. No difference.
"This is a lie. Where in the whitepaper are 133mb suggested? Nowhere.
satoshi himself coded the bitcoin protocol with 1mb block size
"
"You seem to confuse channel capacity with transaction amount.

Yes it doesn't make sense to open a channel that holds an amount that is lower than the current fees. Same goes for any cryptocurrency. You don't send a transaction lower than the fees. It has nothing to do with LN in particular. For off-chain transactions over LN however, there is no such limiations, allowing real micropayments of even Sub-Satoshi size."
Lol, insightful and educational. Thank you so much for your contribution. 
"Wait what?

This is news to me.  And I am not sure if I believe it.

For example, I know for a fact that both Elisabeth Stark, and Roast beef are outspoken small blockers.  They give talks at meetups and thats all they talk about.  

Or is it just that the only LN devs that are given the spotlight are the small blockers?

I know that Poon was a big blocker, so I guess maybe this has some merit."
