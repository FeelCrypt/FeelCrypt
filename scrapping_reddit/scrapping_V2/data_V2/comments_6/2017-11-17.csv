I need 1000 USD in BTC u/tippr
"Here here. Preach. If these ass-headed, cunt-faced clown-sticks had simply promoted their coin instead of putting it at odds with BTC they'd have saved a lot of people a lot of grief.

Then again, they wouldn't have gotten another ivory back scratcher in a weekend then, would they? Amazing how the rich intentionally divide the poor. You think that the masses would have learned by now."

"You could say the same thing about the banking establishment and cryptos.  But my point still stands; despite obviously bypassing the law, the law has a lot of work cut out for it to catch up. At this point it's become entrenched enough that I don't think it ever will, not completely."
"I hope you go all in BTC.

The dysfuncional network that is inflated by a fraud."
This is why I believe in crypto... inflation is theft (only in a sense of being forced into it). if you buy a coin that has inflation then you have agreed to those terms. Governments around the world will hate crypto, but i believe it will boost everyones standard of living to some degree.
We live in a first world country where we can make a credit card transaction nearly instantly. For a  $5 purchase it will never make sense to wait 8 minutes as the paper described. It is digits cash for any large purchase. There’s no need to fight credit cards in this stage of development for any cryptocurrency. I’m specifically describing industrialized nations and not third world countries which would be different. At this point if I️ need cash savings I️ rather have bitcoin than dollars. One is designed to be worth less over time to encourage spending and the other is designed to do the opposite. I’m not a fan boy and trying to argue for anything specifically, I’m just describing and average persons use cases. I may send 40 transactions a year and they are all large sums that don’t need to clear immediately. Either paying friends or purchasing large items etc. the rest of the time I️ just want my money to hold value. Not necessarily increase, but definitely not decrease. 
"Here's the problem - we want third-world countries to be able to participate.  We want these third-world countries to be able to run nodes without huge money investments, because the government will confiscate their expensive equipment.  We want it to be relatively easy to set up a node, whether or not you think it's just super nerd enthusiasts.

I'm also stuck with Comcast, because there's no way in hell the other ISP in my area could serve me 1GB every 10 minutes.  It costs me $80 a month for my internet which is capped at 2TB, so **screw you and your 3-euro unlimited fiber I'M NOT BITTER**.  (I don't really mean that, good on Romania for understanding that internet is important)  So suffice it to say that your experience with internet is not globally applicable.

If block size were the primary scaling method, how long do you think it would take for node sizes to become big enough to fill up a terabyte in a month?  How fast is hard drive tech improving?  Is there a discrepancy between these two?  THAT question is what Core is trying to answer, and it's obvious that they're afraid of what answers they're finding.  I sure as hell trust Core more than the devs behind 2X.  Essentially, if you are going to wind up needing a datacenter to run a node, Bitcoin is not decentralized.  Keeping Bitcoin decentralized is a *requirement*.  It's right there in the description of Bitcoin.  If it's not decentralized, it can be controlled and contained, and suddenly Venezuelans can't communicate with the nodes because their government has firewalled the datacenters."

I don't know.  For as much as was put into bch that someone was buying, someone sold all those coins to them.  I keep thinking a lot of exchanges are dumping little by little.  By pumping money into the coin, it could cause dumpers to dump faster out of greed.  Flush 'em all out and make 2018 better.  I'm bullish on the future of bch.

">Low fees and fast transfers.

>That’s the entire fucking definition of bitcoin.

What absolute misinformed garbage!

Where does it mention fast transfers and low fees being the main goal in the white paper? Hint: nowhere.

The definition of Bitcoin is based around the removal of 3rd party trust. Trust (in the context of removing the need for it) is mentioned 14 times in the white paper. That's the entire point of the blockchain, to remove the need for 3rd party trust. If someone just wanted a system where fees were low and transactions fast a globally distributed public ledger would be one of the last things they choose as a design.

I'd suggest people new to Bitcoin go read the white paper if they wonder what the point of Bitcoin is and find out for themselves. It isn't what this guy proclaims it is. You also shouldn't trust me either of course... just read and it will become obvious that the quoted comment above is incorrect at a fundamental level.

I'm not making a comment on fees here, if they are too high or what have you, I am merely pointing out that what you have proclaimed is so very painfully incorrect."
"It's possible for colluding miners to fool SPV wallets in certain ways. Colluding, cartelised miners can also refuse to process transactions and can orphan the chain of any miner who will process it (i.e. 51% attack).

Confiscation shouldn't be possible as far as I know, however it is possible with hard fork, so many are wary of ceding the miners the ""one-CPU one-vote"" democratic rights to change the protocol rules and still call the new chain bitcoin.

/r/btc focuses on the centralistion problems of who controls /r/bitcoin and bitcoin talk, and the fact that 50% of the main core devs work for one company (that they founded together).

/r/bitcoin focuses on the centralisation problems of ASIC miners having created a set of powerful Chinese pools that are fairly closely affiliated and control about 50% of the hashrate. There are arguments that bigger blocks lead to more mining centralisation too (and less user verification of the chain to keep them honest)."
thx mate
"You're the one throwing tantrums. What's with the childish insults? Can't you just answer the points logically and calmly and format them properly?

Who gives a fuck what Satoshi's vision was? It's software. It's not a religion. That kind of dogmatic thinking means any upgrade to Bitcoin is challenged often with no good reason.

Cash does not have a limited supply, gold does. It is also mined with diminishing returns. Analogous to how Bitcoin works.

"Thank you for your highly factual, objective analysis.

I'm not a BCH supporter, but rollbacks are pretty serious. BTC never did a rollback during gox, and thank god.
The goal of Bcash is to separate you from your bitcoin sadly.
">So with a terrible investment you lost just about half of what you had. Thats BRUTAL.

Lol, where do you get this info from? I didn't lose half of what I had, in fact, overall the amount calculated in dollar is still about the same, even though I cashed out about 17k in dollars."
What good is a shitty network that it has the risks that your money stucks in the mempool and has no utility besides speculation.
What's incredible is that 5 billion dollars flooded into bch over the weekend so you Ver and Jihan dumped their 4 months of accumulating bch at 300$ lol I was hoping to be rid of Ver with this split but now I'm sure he has more btc than when he started...
They'll never use gold either.
I agree

"Now that's telling.

Well yeah brand and network effect, the infrastructure for bitcoin is larger than anything out there.
"> I think a lot of us are in this camp as well, you're far from alone here.

You've all done exactly as you were told. Can I be banned from here now?"
Care to elaborate? 
Not too abnormal but it's still a significant decrease in price, although it'll rise again 
It was about scaling. Core was using the convoluted segwit to prevent proper scaling.
Not saying this is the only reason, but I think it's a part of the reason for the drop... There are a few exchanges that have stated publicly they are NOT giving the free bitcoin cash coins to their customers.  xapo.com is one.  They started with around 650k BCH and are down to 75k.   Bitmex was the latest I heard of a few days ago.  They are dumping all of their BCH coins and giving customers the value of each in btc.  I've been buying/selling BCH every night this week without investing more fiat and the downward movement is definitely happening in chunks.  I sell all my coins at the top of a small peak and assume it's going to drop hard shortly after.  Check the MFI and MACD to get a sense of when it's probably bottomed out and then buy everything back again.  The difference in price and the fact that btc has probably gone up in value while waiting, allows me to pickup all the coins and a few more.  Been trying to average 2 - 3 such trading sessions each night.  I view the big pump a week and a half ago as someone buying up a lot of coins that were probably just going to be dumped anyway. (not that that was the sole purpose, but I'm viewing it as a nice side effect)  Flush 'em out earlier than they would've dumped rather than a steady, slow leak of coins that keeps the price low longer than we'd like.  For all the coins being dumped now, yeah, it can drive the price down, but it also allows for some great trades as well as a fire sale if the price gets too low.   It's currently $905 as I write this.  Looking forward to picking up some more tonight.
As Bitcoin cash disappears will r/btc go back to talking about btc?
BCH doesn’t have such value as BTC because it is overly centralised and easy to censor.
"(One example) from the Google built-in dictionary:

'a hostile clash between forces of rival countries.
""the US regretted the incident""'

That sounds like a more negative word than ""event"" to me. The Bitcoin Cash event was positive for Bitcoin (Cash) but negative for Bitcoin Segwit. It's good for Bitcoin Cash that it comes closer to ""the tippening"" or ""the cashening"". So from my perspective as a big blocker it was an event not an incident. Or if you want a positive word you could use the word ""accomplishment"" for example. But a neutral word would be best in my opinion."
"> 1. Why respect the supposed wishes of someone who gave up and left the project?

So you’re buthurt basically? I mean seriously. Did you really write that sentence? Are we supposed to be having temper tantrums because the creator is no longer communicating with us? Are you twelve? 

> 2. Why did he model it after gold if it was supposed to be cash?

He didn’t. There are mountains of elements related to this system that make it obviously for transactions and transfer of value. **The entire mantra of bitcoin since day one has been a new way to transfer value digitally***

> 3. People care about censorship resistance and decentralization. If they want fast payments they can use their credit card or Paypal.

The way you guys twist reality is unbelievable. Decentralization? Then keep it on the fucking ***world wide block chain***. How about that for decentralized?  Anyone who says PayPal should be used instead of bitcoin, has an inherently false understanding of the basics of bitcoin. Plain and simple.

You are either obviously making shit up, or you are unbelievably clueless. Your posting history is three years old, and you don’t get this stuff? It almost makes me wonder if you are one of those accounts that block stream has co-opted for trolling.

If you’re an actual person that was here three years ago, you should remember that bitcoin was 100% all about currency/transactions/cheaper than Western Union etc. "
awesome comment my dude. 
"What does that have to do with censorship and confiscation though?

I've heard the growing block chain size issue plenty of times but I don't see how it is related to the above. I'm also not positive it is as big an issue as you make it out to be as even if every Bitcoin cash block from now on was completely full it would take 4.45 years to get the block chain to 2TB and obviously the blocks are no where near full"

To answer the question. That's why we all are here isn't it. To discuss stuff
Actually anyone with a brain would know BCH is a shitcoin with no future and will never supplant BTC. Keep being wrong like I give a fuck. Stay salty.

"When you pay $0.01 fee, who do you think pays the miners that added your transactions in a block?

On Bitcoin, it's now inflation+fees. On Bitcoin Cash, it's fully paid by the inflation (the fees are peanuts). What do you think will happen if Bitcoin Cash is successful enough to handle VISA level transactions: 2000/s?"
"1 penny fees?  Only a few weeks ago?  Nope.  You could set your wallet to only pay that much, but it would take longer or get stuck.  Look at this chart of just the last 6 months, avg fee was between $2.00 & $4.00 June/July, two months BEFORE bitcoin cash was even born.  Yeah, it's gone up a lot in the past few weeks, but I've never seen/heard of 1 penny btc fees in the last 2 weeks that you've been into crypto.

"> until the BCH incident

It wasn't an ""incident"". It was an event."
"Yeah check out the mad spike:
https://bitcoinfees.info"
Yes, I agree. Just a little sad that I knew about bitcoin 3 years ago but didn't have money then, nor do I have it now. But one day!
fees don't have to depend on price of btc.  fees are only caused by competition to get included in the block, which is affected by block size.
"You don't seem to know what's going on here.. Full nodes are not miners, and plenty of regular people run full nodes. 

Also bitcoin has no plans to reduce block time to 1 minute as you suggest. Both BCH and BTC have a 10 minute block time and 8MB and 1MB blocks respectively; BCH will require a higher sync time, higher ongoing bandwidth, and more CPU power. BTC's solution is to move unnecessary information out of the blockchain (segwit, schnorr signitures) and then move smaller payments out of the blockchain to higher layers (LN). BCH's solution is to increase blocksize again when full, further compounding those issues. 

The rest of what you said falls apart from here. But even so, clearly for now BCH is a more usable chain, and perhaps BTC should have embraced 2X..

Ultimately we need a solution that's capacity will reasonably stabilise or exceed the popcap of users. This probably means something involving both higher layers and shear bigger blocks, *and* some other technology that hasn't been realised yet."
">I don't want to spread FUD

You definitely are. Sit back and hold real Bitcoin (Cash) - you'll be just fine."
"For your next astroturfing campaign, can you not make it so obvious?

Bitcoin Cash went up ~700% in a matter of days. It doesn't take a genius to tell that is not sustainable. Just look at bitcoin pre 2013 and you will see the same thing. The only difference is the market cap is much larger and BCH is evolving at a drastically faster rate than BTC.

If anyone thought the flippening would happen in one shot, they are just dumb. It will keep popping and crashing in the short term but the long term trend for the flippening is very clear."
Good advice, thanks for your input. 
Until the mega whale backers of BCH buy out BCH with all their BTC, I think it won't get much rise. They need to put their money where their mouth is.
"Expect it to keep going down for the next ~90 days. There's some big players who've said they're going to liquidate and that will continue to hurt the price.

Do you actually have faith in Bitcoin Cash? Haven't had time to research it, don't know anything about the people behind the project, nor how secure the network is having to share hashing power with blockstreamcoin.  
"> No, it does not. This is the biggest equivocation in all of this imHo

Yes, it does. With bigger blocks, there will be a longer sync time than without *for a full node*.

> Now you can pack them in 80 blocks of 1 MB or 10 blocks of 8 MB. Recall, they are exactly the same N transactions.

Yeah but you're not proposing having less blocks. You're proposing having the same amount of blocks, all of them 8MB. This doesn't make sense.

> Sending 80 block headers or 10

Again, talking about full-verifying nodes. No-one disputes the ability of running an SPV wallet at nearly any size block.

> ""A block header with no transactions would be about 80 bytes. If we suppose blocks are generated every 10 minutes, 80 bytes * 6 * 24 * 365 = 4.2MB per year. With computer systems typically selling with 2GB of RAM as of 2008, and Moore's Law predicting current growth of 1.2GB per year, storage should not be a problem even if the block headers must be kept in memory.""

It's really easy to win the argument if you just keep talking about SPV wallets, even though the entire point of my comment was about full nodes."
Propably not all. But those that decided to fork are more or less, or at least remember why Bitcoin was created in the first place - to unbank the banked and free people from government and bank manipulated money.
No they didn't.  They specifically said BCH will never be bitcoin.  Everyone knows it would be too much confusion.  It will always be bitcoin cash, the bitcoin made to be used like cash, specifically, and Jan 14 they are rolling out a new address scheme to distinguish it even... where are you getting your information?
"You came here and tried to spark a debate, I hit you with facts and you go crying off into the distance.

"Sure, one is just 1% ahead of the other currently. Just 1%!

That's understandable, though I personally would opt for other coins with better tech than both BTC and BCH. Contentious forking is not a viable long term system, IMO, and hazardous to the crypto scene. 
"Xapo started with around 650,000 bch and dumped until they hit 92,000, then seemed to back off for a while.  They started back up a few days ago and are down to around 75,000.  Wallet link below.

"Name calling? Lol, if me describing your currency as ""bcash"" is so offensive, you need to go back to your safe space. "
It's honestly really funny how much /r/btc thinks the chat is some secret cabal running a troll army, when in fact it's really just friendly technical discussion and some memes/shitposting.
I, too, would like to see a website that tracked the buy/sell walls in all of the crypto exchanges.
Can you link me to that?  I've seen a dozen other instances of BCH devs saying otherwise.  I'm also part of their developer mailing list where they are discussing changing the address scheme to make it different from bitcoin, so that it's clear that it's not bitcoin. Why would they be doing that if they wanted it to be bitcoin??
"It's pretty simple man:

bigger blocks means more resources to run a full node and longer initial syncs.

If that outpaces the growth of storage space and bandwidth increase (in the median country, not in an advanced western country, the world outside Europe and the US does exist) then less people will run full nodes (already happening).

That's a basic fact. Very large blocks also grant a huge advantage to those who can propagate the block quickly (i.e. huge server farms, the huger the greater the advantage)."
that isn't the point
Bigger blocks take longer to transmit and verify.  That overhead favors bigger miners.  Too much favoritism towards big miners and eventually there will just be a small number of giant miners and a negligible number of small miners.  Those giant miners can then form a cartel and thus will together have at least 51% of the hash power.
"While some miners are supporters of specific coins. A LOT of miners don't hold the coins they mine. They sell for fiat ASAP and take profits immediately after block rewards come in. They want to get paid. They mine whatever is most profitable. BTC BCH XMR LTC ... they don't care. They want profit. Just like traders. 

The miners that speak out may have a loud voice, but don't represent their entire mining pool. we don't know the opinion of the miner community as a whole. Just like reddit is only a small fraction of the fraction of the crytocommunity that types in English.

-humble two satoshis"
"Well how do you know what the BCH price was when I bought it? I also bought a decent amount of them when they were sub 500.

Anyway, go troll someone else, I don't wanna argue with you."
Another thing.. you realize there are only going to be 21,000,000 BCH, and 21 million BTC right?  They're nearly identical.  BCH produces a few blocks faster, which is a microscopic fraction of the total BTC/BCH that will ever be in existence.  BCH is identical to BTC in this regard re: controlled supply.
"> Nobody cares if fees and transactions are too high..That's not Bitcoin's use from a long time, and we all know it.

But when r/btc stopped being a sub about Bitcoin but a BCH echo chamber instead (using words the sub uses), it started denying it, and denying all facts going against pumping BCH.

> I'd still like to hear some opinions and a constructive discussion.

BTC has become the store of value of crypto, you are right, and the day to day cash is gonna be handled by the fast and cheap technology that's gonna be the easiest to swap with Bitcoin, be it Lightning Network, another crypto with atomic swap, e.g. LTC, or something else.

By trying to be both (store and cash), BCH is doomed because it's good at neither: it's not a store of value, and its onchain transactions can't scale exponentially: it can't compete with faster and cheaper coins (e.g. IOTA has no fee and transactions are confirmed in seconds, it's just an example, lots of altcoins can do better than BCH in this specific domain)."
"Longer to transmit? We are talking about 8mb every 10 minutes assuming the blocks are completely full which often they are not.

So at only 15mbs you could download that in 4.2666 seconds. And most people have much faster connections.

Minimum connection speed to keep up at a rate of 8MB per 10 minutes would be around 100kbps. So old dial up connections are close to being able to keep up."

"Look man, I'm gonna enjoy my evening.

And tbh I've lost track of what you're talking about.

Some complex reasoning that I haven't the energy right now to unpick, about how you can have 8mb blocks without it using any more storage space or processing power for a full node.

I don't agree with LN personally, I want on-chain scaling and sharding.  That and I have very little faith in the BTC core team as developers (in comparison to Gavin, Amaury etc on the *distributed* BCH development teams.)
Of course I'm not objective, I have a well-defined opinion on the matter. 
That isn't an argument.
I read about this tactic last night for the first time.  I have also caught myself falling for it in the past :)
Ok, I just checked my balances and in terms of value I am still about the same. Thank you for worrying about me though.
"I don't consider it contentious.  I consider bitcoin core contentious for ignoring Satoshi's blocksize increase patch, it's still available on the forums from 2010.  Satoshi must have died from a heart attack after seeing what BTC core has done.

BCH would have never existed in the first place if BTC didn't screw things up so badly.

I still like other cryptos too though.  I hold many of them hoping they become more widely adopted.  Until then, BCH seems like a contender for daily usage for now.  Gotta go with the flow and move where the market does."

"Okay, then. Let us say you're right. 
But your smallblock arguments still do not hold water as I see it. But it is allright - there are two distinct chains now (BCH and BTC), each with their own roadmap and idea of how scaling should be approached. 
Let the best chain win. 

After all, in the end fundamentals is what creates value. How it pans out nobody can know for sure. "
"> ""bigger blocks means more resources to run a full node and longer initial syncs.""

....because there's more data to download and process. This isn't hard. An 8mb blocks full of transactions every 10 minutes is 8x greater the amount of storage and processing every hour than 1mb blocks.

Again: WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FULL NODES, NOT SPV WALLETS.

> And if that's true, what is the true impact of initial sync?

It already takes days on a (way above average by global standards) internet connection. More than half of the current block chain is since the 1mb blocks became full.

> Seems to be little to none after you get the blockchain downloaded.

The impact of the initial sync is little to none *after* you've downloaded the blockchain? Well yeah, no shit, tautological statement of the year. The impact of a bullet to the brain is little to none **after** the bullet has struck you too... what's your point?

It's downloading the blockchain that **is** the true impact. It takes fucking ages, then it takes fucking ages to build the databases too.

Have you done it recently? It's a pain, already. Growth in internet speeds have not kept up with the explosion of bitcoin transactions, not even close.

The system's robustness relies on motivated hobbyists being able to validate the full chain.

As our friend Fake Satoshi CSW said ""If you can't afford a $20,000 node then you can piss off""... Yeah that's not the bitcoin I want to see come into existence."
Even Luke Jr says Bitcoin will scale on chain at some point, don't be silly.

Perfect, just in time for coinbase to grant everyone their bch!

Here's a little secret ... I own BTC and BCH in exactly equal amounts (in terms of coins, not dollars).  No matter which one loses, I win.
Not so much xapo anymore.  I've been watching their wallet for a few weeks.  They started dumping around 650k bch, but It's been pretty stagnant around 92k for a while now.  Only dropped down to 75k the last few days.  There's been much more than that dumped total recently, so there has to be a few other exchanges or rich btc lovers dumping.

"cuz everyone sees BCH as a scam coin and gives it no respect. anyone investing in this coin is playing with major fire. as far as high transaction fees etc with BTC, those are gonna be solved soon enuff, and if ppl want alts with low fees and fast transactions, BCH is by far not the best alternative either.

"There has only been one hack that was reversed, and it was in the super early days when it was clear that the blockchain was not ready for stable releases of dapps yet.  Anyway, all incidents were user error in contracts, not a problem with ethereum itself. Bitcoin has also has multiple hacks of the same size or larger. And if you still don't think that's acceptable, there's ETC which still has better tech than BCH.

And by the way it's absolutely not controlled by a single entity."
This would have been a very reasonable answer, except for one very stubborn fact: if this argument was good, /r/bitcoin would not have a need for any censorship. The fact that any dissenting opinion is suppressed means something else is at play here
"Sooo.. centralization.

This seems so backwards, all because what the fees are too high to record everything on the blockchain?"

If that doesn't scream rivalry I don't know what does... "
[deleted]
I understand some of your arguments. But actually BCH has an unique selling point advantage over Ethereum and the others. That is to share the same ledger with BTC till april and using the oldschool bitcoin protocoll. BCH has a much more diverse coin spread than most of the altcoins. And BCH is very easy to adapt to allready existing bitcoin codebases. I like Ethereum very much and own some coins as well, but as the recent sc trouble showed its as of now not a good online payment alternative to Bitcoin.
He seems to be showing how full-nodes won't have worse sync times by showing that SPV wallets won't... it doesn't make sense.
To be clear They are not selling on the open exchanges. Most of what you are seeing is trickle down effect ofnlosing 70%+ of gained value
"4btc into bcc a few days ago: roughly 13.5 bcc

Btc value now ~ 32k
13.5 bcc value now: ~13k


Even worse than I previously estimated. "
"If you deeply think Bitcoin is valued $130B because of the brand, I suggest you to stop investing. Anywhere.

It's just a suggestion though."
Bitcoin Cash has a much better chance of succeeding than bitcoin segwit right now, but it still has limitations. Ill be selling my segwit coins and holding my bitcoin cash coins. It still needs a more permanent blocksize increase fix though. 
if I get banned in this sub for speaking the truth I don't care. BCH has potential, sure. However, will it replace bitcoin? I don't think so. Why? Without going into full detail, I'm want to keep this short, Bitcoin keeps it values when it comes to why it even came into existence and it's goals and does not sacrifice it for short term solutions to short term problems. I also believe that bitcoin will eventually need to increase it's blocksize as it will help a lot but what bitcoin cash is trying to do is already being done much better by so many other altcoins like dash and litecoin and even potentially bitcoin in the future which will make even them less valuable. So I don't see how bitcoin cash could replace bitcoin, outperform litecoin/dash/others or traditional players like paypal.
"Huhmm..

That's a quote I can get behind. :)"

51% attack has nothing to do with block size though. Both chains are vulnerable to that and both chains have the same miners mining them. They just switch back and forth based on profitability.
I don't know, maybe try thinking for yourself every once in a while?
I don't get the joke...
"Yes. I agree. However, the sheer amount of bch it would had have taken to knock the price down from 3k to 2k in SECONDS from .5 to .3 is only in the hands of a select few. Why are we not looking directly at those who 1) have the funds to do just that and 2) have the incentive to do it as well?

A coin does not go from being worth .08 to .5 overnight if it's not a pump and dump. It's just unrealistic. It was not organic in the least and fed off of the hype propogated by folks like ver and jihan, who then likely took advantage of the hyperinflated price and dumped on all the idiots who believed this coin could be worth even a third of a bitcoin."
"Why are they propping up BTC?

What is their motive? "
"Why would bitfinex take it upon themselves to do this?

"Who says I am a huge BCH supporter? I am anti-Core (I think they are ill mannered) and a well-wisher for BCH. More the former.

BTW BTG does not  have the history of BCH. Yes they share the same transaction history but the BCH  ideology has had a lot of support from a once majority (now a minority) in the BTC community. That is what I mean by history."

"What a load of shit and FUD.

Bitcoin *will* scale, it's no state secret that it will do it on second and third layer solutions.

I get a very strong feeling that the people that believe BCH will overtake Bitcoin can't see past a few months when it comes to scaling solutions.

Eventually bigger blocks will happen even in Bitcoin. But the developers are keeping their eyes on the ball, and focusing on actually solving scaling. Not just increasing the block size and declaring victory over the competition.

Do you think bigger blocks will get us to micro and nano transactions?

I don't."
I think it's about taking on Core for having changed bitcoin's technical road map
"I looked and I didn't see any of Roger Ver's Bitcoins being used to buy BCH.

"Why does a subreddit’s censorship have anything to do with the technology’s potential for censorship?

"People generally don't get banned here for posting their opinions. Feel free.

I'm fairly sure that all well-wishers for BCH's success are well aware that it's a long uphill battle to ""dethrone BTC"". I don't think that's largely the immediate goal either, it's more about fundamentals of getting adoption and usage out of a currency rather than being the king. 

Of course with any currency gaining traction, this will bring fair share of ""_to the moon_""ers."
This is not r/bitcoin where you get banned for having a different opinion.
I'm currently mining Monero so I can get some ASIC and also invest **MORE** in BCH. Time to get BCH afloat. *You'll all be floating down here*
The value of gold is mostly speculative as well. The value it gets from jewelry and electronics some wouldn’t hold its price. If you needed to pay me 10000 dollars right now, would it be easier to send me gold through the mail or bitcoin for a $0.70 fee? That’s the fee i paid 24 hours ago. I immediately had a notification saying it was sent and it was fully confirmed an hour later. It wasn’t designed to buy coffee. Keep in mind, if the demand for bitcoin stays level the supply is always dropping. There is always more gold to mine. 
"Let's extend your argument then.  In order to be used globally on a regular basis, it wouldn't need to clear 7.2 million transactions daily, it would need to clear *3 billion* transactions daily.

On-chain scaling is not going to suffice.

We're talking 1GB blocks being transferred across the entire network every 10 minutes (or less) that need to be processed and verified by every full node.  Most people's internet will choke on downloading a gig every 10 minutes.  Anyone on Comcast would go over their 2TB limit in the first two weeks of the month, provided they were able to acquire the entire blockchain in the first place.  A 6TB hard drive costs around $180.  You would need to shell out that much money more than every month and a half, and somehow hook it up to your node, for a cost of $1400 a year just for data storage.

And that's only if we want a market the size of Visa.  We don't want to stop at Visa.  We want to shoot for the moon, and we don't want to help some big centralized authority get there who can afford giant data centers - we want to go there ourselves."
"Not only that, but also I am sure the OP doesn't realise, and I think this is what is happening, is that very large BTC/BCH holders who are supporters of BCH and want it to become the good ol' Bitcoin again that all unaware people know... they have to be very careful so that when the real flippening is happening, it is sustainable... and this is not so easy to do. All the cards are still on the table, even the SegWit2X fork... which can still happen.

Overall I have all the confidence that Bitcoin Cash is going to be bigger and better then anything else in coming 2018, people just don't know it yet (and as usual, they only find out about it after it happens)."
"Long term BCH has a very solid use case. Buying now is speculation, but long term, it has a chance of being one of the more popular cryptos. I think the price will stabilize over time, though who knows what that price will be. Buying now is speculation, and the price will rise and fall, just like every other crypto.

Getting rich with crypto is exactly this feeling you have now, that inner monologue saying, ""What if this investment goes to zero."" At this point, nothing is 100% going to work out, not even BTC.

You are absolutely right to ask about BCH's next moves are. There's lots of posts here about it on the Reddit. My advice for now, at least how I feel about owning BCH, is invest what you can afford to lose, and enjoy the ride. Don't ""trade"".

If it turns out that BCH becomes a dominant cryptocurrency in the future, great! You can use it for its intended use and still benefit from it even if it didn't make you rich. If it goes to zero, then you only lost what you weren't attached to!"

Buying BCH with fiat is coming to Coinbase, the only question is when. The CEO of coinbase has said way too many favorable things about BCH. Once BCH is on Coinbase, it is over for BTC. Too many people will see how much cheaper and faster BCH is to use. And Coinbase is one of the many companies that want fast and cheap BTC transactions, because it benefits their business.

Your gains look like an ants fart compared to my gains and are shrinking by the minute. You salty as fuck.
"If BTC proved to be more of an actual functional cryptocurrency, and not primarily a settlement layer; I do believe this would have an effect on BCH, but *not* as much as we would think. Why? Look at the current price of BTC compared with BCH. BCH astoundingly still has held some solid footing after BTC has met an ATH. Also look at the transaction volume (& difference between the two), even if *most* of the volume is from people off-loading their current BCH; that mean that others are *buying* it - while maintaining this price point. . . I do agree it is wise to diversify any portfolio, I wouldn't have exchanged 90% of my BTC for BCH (at BCHs ATH nonetheless) if I didn't truly believe that the 'flippining' wasn't an imminent possibility (& it was actually shockingly close to occurring with the Hash rate & unconfirmed transactions of BTC)."
I listened to both sides of the argument for a spell and thought it was possible the change of currencies was happening (apparently it was actually relatively close looking at the hash rate of BTC at the time & its insanely backed-up mempool). I reacted based on this (and emotion) and lost economically in my unrealized gain up-to this point in my cryptocurrency career. . . So in a sense you are right, I did as I was told. . . It's been a wild ride and an intense (& costly experience) but I'm still looking to the future, it's an amazing time to be alive and apart of this at any rate. Good luck.
"I think you should never ever put your eggs in one basket.

I wish these parasitic investors weren't majority.
It's a backbone for the internet of value that will enable millions of transactions per second for billions of people. Bitcoin will have state channel networks auch as Lightning, it will have sidechains such as Rootstock, it will have MAST and dozens of other innovations that Bcash won't have, because you deleted Segwit from the code. Bitcoin is the internet of money. Bcash is just another shitty altcoin.

"Not a chance. I think this sub gets off on hearing bad news about Bitcoin in general.

They really do hate it.


BTW, I actually think that if BCH drops to ~500-600 it might be a good buying opportunity.

But i'm not doing it. I really don't believe in the project. Big blocks are a short term fix to a very serious challenge for crypto."
"Exactly. 

OP is forgetting a key aspect. Bitcoin can not grow any more with the blocks limited to where they're at. It's at the ceiling already. When people send crypto to an exchange like bittrex, it costs them $20 and can take days. People will seek alternative trading pairs to buy with. Bitcoin can't grow much more than it currently is before something else will start to be used as the main trading pair at exchanges. And whatever that coin is, will overtake Bitcoin.

Also, Bitcoin Cash was $300 a few weeks ago. All that's happened is we had a FOMO after 2x was cancelled, then when the exchanges started crashing, it stopped it. But you've got to have patience, look at the bigger picture of what's happening here. Bitcoin will be unable to grow to $20,000 a coin because no one will spend $50 to buy $100 of coin, and even if they did, the coin being used to send to exchanges for the trading pairs would most certainly not be bitcoin. So these types of posts about Bitcoin Cash are way, way premature.

In other words, Bitcoin _does_ still need to be able to transact with."
">But let's face some (in my opinion) facts:

There were occasional congestions for 2 years.
">The guy who developed the Solidity language wrote a $150,000,000 bug when using it. That's a problem with Ethereum itself.

No, it isn't. It is user error, regardless of who that user is. At best it's a problem with Solidity, but ethereum supports other languages, and more is to come. And either way, in the context of BCH, ethereum can do what BCH does, send and receive transactions, without touching its smart contract functionality at all.

>It can also all be done on a sidechain of bitcoin

A secondary smart contract system on bitcoin will never be able to beat a blockchain designed to accommodate smart contracts from the start.

>if it ever develops a use case which it hasn't yet.

This is the most ridiculous thing I've heard in weeks. Just because you, for whatever reason, hasn't made use of the numerous fantastic uses of smart contracts yet, doesn't mean those use cases don't exist. "

"Over the last 4 months of heavy crytpo trading and research, my biggest take aways have been these:


1. BTC has the highest probability of continuous growth, it's the safe play
2.  If you're going to trade alts, move profits into BTC, Increasing your BTC should always be the goal. Most big alt movements are pumps that will not last.
3. You're probably going to lose money if you step out of BTC for any length of time.

"> lightning

I don't like LN.

It's no longer p2p, it's centralized around liquidity, huge holders of Bitcoin will get routing fees without even mining, it's only feasible for small amounts mostly and doesn't solve scaling issues.

There's no way around it, a blockchain is a database, at some point you need to add rows to your tables if you want to scale or create tables more often. "
"I wouldn't even call things like the tip bot a ""gimmick"", that is a legitimate use case (microtransactions) that BTC threw away years ago. "
Ahahahhahahhahha  $280 maybe.  
I did the same thing, I lost out on probably 5k because of so much confusion and also because the Fork caused my transactions on Kraken (WHICH SUCKS) to take 2 fucking days to transact.  If Kraken didnt suck I would have maybe made something.

It was scary af to start, but now, I buy / sell multiple times per night.  Had I been as comfortable with doing that when the $2k price hit, I definitely would've sold back to btc to retain the value.  Live and learn!!!  Waiting for next time!!
"""able to survive attacks from governments"" 

...and you believe that Core's roadmap and massive censorship facilitates that? In that case, you are a tad bit naive.

The important thing is you don't take one side. diversify on both coins, and some alts. If you have all your eggs in one basket and that basket drops, you're going to feel it.
Ah, good point!  Didn't stop to think they could sell them directly to someone outside an exchange.
lol no. Why would you touch bch now? The last few days have proved that its not going to stay stable until it reaches $500-$600. Even that is doubtful as there is also a chance that it could reach $300 too. 
"there wasnt a single rollback. There was a fork, which changed the value of two contracts. Thats it. Rollback implies that everything that happened after the hack was rolled back. That never happened. BTC would have fixed Mt Gox probably if it didnt happend over years.

BTC isnt number 1 because of its amazing immutability and resistance to change. None of the new money cares about this. They only things they know about bitcoin are ""it keeps rising and its used for drugs and money laundring"". Yeh still, its the only one they know. This is also why BCH will never overtake BTC. Bitcoin has the brand and it seems to be everything that matters, since its tech is vastly inferior to most other top 10 coins. "
"Those are all the consequences of the trust people have in a coin, not the other way. And the trust is gained by technical fundamentals and governance.

2. Bought BCH when it started taking off at $750 
3. Sold BCH incrementally @ $1250, $1350, $1450, $1750 @$2,200
4. Transferred 80% back into ETH, IOTA, + OMG, leaving 20% split between BTC + BCH.

Made $4k.

I am new also and feel it’s possible both sides are right and bitcoin and bitcoin cash don’t need to be in competition and can both keep going up

"I've been around since the beginning. Bitcoin succeeded because it fulfills the qualities to be private money, while being too decentralized to shut down. I knew in 2011 that no matter what happened, the idea could not be stopped. Even when the banks took over the main /bitcoin github and changed it to segwit coin, Bitcoin just rebranded to Bitcoin Cash and keeps marching.

The interesting dynamic now is that the banks are forced to pump money into their frankenstein segwitcoin just to keep it functioning - meaning that we can all profit off them."
I would simply suggest learning about the history of bitcoin and its many forks and decide for yourself. The problem is that even well-meaning advocates are likely to have money on the table, in favor of one crypto over another. That is always going to help form a bias in one's perspective. I think block size is a distraction, not the end-all-be-all to improve scalability. We have many hills to climb as communities of crypto users to get to worldwide adoption.
"Back in march, btc was $1200. Let's say a transaction costs 0.001 btc in fees. This means, 0.001 * $1200 = $1.2 of fees. Today, btc is worth $7900, which means $7.9 of fees. When bitcoin is at $100k, the same fee will cost $100.

There's definitely competition on the chain, and that's affecting the satoshi cost. But you also have to consider the price of btc."
What has merchant acceptance to do with financial freedom? People don't want their money seized or subject to inflation. That's why Bitcoin is going up.
Of course they're going to talk about how great it is. They still are. 
"Im not opposed to monero in principle , but there are other technical reasons why I prefer btc over monero . I am more encouraged over the coinjoin+ CT fungibility solutions work being done over monero's ring signatures that cannot scale well

Sorry, I kind of got off on a tangent. The first sentence was for you, and the rest was just for anyone who read it.
WTF is this thread? The clueless ramblings of an ignorant concern troll. It has to be the least insightful post I've ever read and still it's the most highly upvoted for a long time. Why make the astroturfing so obvious? Only total noobs will fall for this, and you should be ashamed for all the misery you will cause them in the end. Bitcoin Blocktsream is a broken, crippled piece of shit coin. It's inevitable that it will fail.
something similar happen to me, and I lost about 0.5 bitcoin. This is investments, and crypto is not easy to trade, it's much harder than stocks, even the experts fails to predict this market.

"People always quote averages with skewed data.

IMO either put a sell at a gain and wait for however long it takes, or move to ETH and don't sell until you are in the black. The question is which one will get you back sooner?
I can use 1 of any 50 shitcoins if its not a store of value...
Sure, but I think it's short sighted by the market, btc has some fundamental flaws that need to be fixed with hard forks if more people continue to flock to the coin. My prediction is that it will stagnate around $10-15k.
Priced in by the market man. Don’t let your emotions ruin a trade.

"1 mb inrease to 2 mb wasnt rocket science and could easily have been done in order to scale for the time being until those other ""Solutions"" were ready. Bitcoin im sure will scale one day but not in a way that makes any sense for anyone else but the rich. Its a banking system now and will be used as such. If you think its anything but i feel sorry for you. You obviously are not a big picture person and obviously arent a libertarian or anachist. If you were you would see the writing on the wall. I have no doubt bitcoin will succeed but its not the same product as it was when it set out. all core has done so far is prove that they cannot scale, maybe one day when they are ready they will actually do what they set out to do. Bch did it no problem and yet they dont have the ""best"" devs in the world according to core fanboys. It really didnt take much just to keep things moving. anyways enjoy Bitcoin, I hope all goes well :) "
Yeah that was a quick drop. But that might mean its the bottom. Theres sometimes accelerated drops as the market finds the bottom support.
Won't happen. The big push for Bitcoin Cash came from Jihan Wu who is the CEO of Bitmain which is a company that creates ASIC Mining equipment.

It's the coin that started it all. How can you say that? It's still the most secure and censorship resistant money of any kind.
"This is such a naive perspective on what's actually involved in the largest portion of Bitcoin's market cap. Do you think most investors understand even the most basic technical aspects of Bitcoin? I don't.

I'm fairly confident that at this point, with enough marketing budget, someone could literally clone Bitcoin with a fresh ledger and give it an equally cool name, and get that coin to over $1k/pc over the course of 2 years."
"You mean in 2011? At the time there was 0 competition from alt coin scene? Of course it had potential, I would even go as far as to say revolutionary. But it's 2017 now and the play field has changed drastically. 


BCH has as much potential as any other mediocre alt coin, because lets face it, competition is tight and the tech is not that impressive Actually it's the laziest thing they could have done, just increasing the block size. List of alts that are as good if not better (yet more undervalued) tech than BCH is long. "

">Arguably the 'bloated' chain will already be the chain in more widespread use, otherwise it probably wouldn't be so bloated, right?

I'd argue you'd have to take the total fees into account, otherwise a lot of the bloat might just be a few entities like Satoshi dice using the blockchain as a cheap storage medium. "
When the pump was ongoing, I was saying that even though big players had the best intention it would do more bad than good for BCH. Instead of slowly building up market cap, now everyone sees as a highly volatile dangerous currency.

"Transparency is the key with tether yes. They have not proved thhey have $1 for every $1 USDT since March, when the crypto market took off. And they also offer leveraged margin trading on Bitfinex with USDT. So each one of those USDT, real or fake, can be leveraged to $5-10. If only 20% of the Tether is faked by Bitfinex, and they are leveraging on their own exchange, which there is good evidence for, then they have enough to prop the price like crazy with leverage. If that leveraged move goes wrong, they cover the loss from the 80% of real USD that has been deposited. 

Noone is claiming all USDT is unbacked. The problem gets even shadier for other the many people holding USDT if its only partially backed. If its not 100% 1:1 ratio, they should all be in prison. "
Thanks!
I could say the same thing. Don't believe every lie Roger Ver, Craig Fake-Satoshi Wright and Bitmain feed you.
Other peoples opinion on here definitely made a large impact on me and my actions. It definitely seemed like a real possibility. . . Really, I probably never would have even given a thought to BCH before coming here.
Ah, the Coreans.
"Why would anybody want to repeat the same set of arguments for the millionth time if somebody is going to come tomorrow and ask:

> how does increasing the block size make bitcoin vulnerable to censorship and government/bank confiscation?"
"The argument is related to whether people can run full nodes or not. larger block sizes means more initial sync time, more ongoing bandwidth and processing power. A lot of people interpret ""I think people should be able to run full nodes"" as ""I think that everyone should run one"". Personally I don't want to be in a situation where it's unfeasible for a motivated average user to verify the full chain as Bitcoin would then, in my opinion, lose its trustlessness. Others disagree. Small blockers tend to favour layer 2 solutions like lightning networks.

The argument most people have in here is a variation of ""moore's law, as bitcoin grows, bandwith and harddisk space will get cheaper in tandem"" or ""no-one really needs to run a full node anyway except miners and large transaction processors/businesses, the rest can use SPV wallets (which only download the block headers and the details of relevant transactions)"". Big blockers tend to feel that in practise, lightning networks would not be all that peer-to-peer and would centralise on payment-processor hubs.

I fall on the small blocker side of things, but that's the best non-biased answer I can give. Those of us who are intellectually honest will admit this is by no means a completely settled debate on either side.

The very angry people in here are angry because they feel they're prevented from having the discussion in /r/bitcoin and bitcointalk. They're justified in this, even if I tend to disagree with them on most other things."

"Hint: Bitcoin Cash did fall back to $851 area in Bitfinex where it suppose to. 
850 area is the BCH value neutral zone. 
Meaning whenever, if, BCH fall to $350 will immediately bounce back to neutral, opposite hold if BCH pop above 1350 area will fall back to neutral zone. Could last days to weeks.

Once these so call congestion range completed, will rally retest previous high or even make new high, next year."
If it gets to 200-400 usd I'll buy some 
Pump and dump confirmed
Learned a very expensive lesson. Hopefully never again. Still have a little BCH in case we go north again, but it's a tough game.
"Your problem is that it sounds like you sold most of your BTC for BCH when you should have holdings in both. Use BCH as a hedge. 

its likely they will co-exist. I own  both. If BTC chain dies and I lose that money then Im covered by the higher quantity in BCH coin"
"But it's a fork of bitcoin. It shares the same genesis block. And if it would accumulate more proof of work out would by definition be bitcoin. That's how it's stated in the white paper. 

If it'd be a completely new coin that'd be s whole different story, but it's supposed to be a protocol upgrade. Sadly not everybody agreed with that, and that's where the proof of work is the deciding factor. That is by design from the very first day.

And again, I'm not the one saying it's bitcoin. It can be the official bitcoin, but it's far from actually being it right now."
"If you cannot handle volatility, you will lose money in cryptos or stocks.

People will need to be patient for the following:

* Bitcoin.com selling BCH at beginning of December

* possibility of Coinbase enabling BCH trading in January

* Roger Ver restarting conversations with companies that rejected BTC due to fees, to accept BCH

* Bitcoin.com promoting BCH to Venezuela"

"I wish this kind of users weren't present.

Maybe a bigger correction is needed to discard the opportunists."
Actually 2013
I think it's better to work on adoption rather than worrying about the outright price. The advantage we have over BTC is that we can actually use the damn thing, so we should promote that as much as possible. We can tip people, we can play games like Satoshi Dice, what's not to like? I'm in it for the potential of the technology, not to delude myself with thoughts that I'm some genius investor who will get rich.
If you think that is a valuable crypto then it is a golden chance to add more positions, if you are just a speculator then you will lose either way
">While Bitcoin Cash solves some of BTC's problems..It's still dependent on expensive asic equipment to be part of the network..A network that rely basically on one single ASIC provider. and the few chinese farms that have a low enough electricity. I don't want to spread FUD, but what are the next moves...?

The next move is change your BTC/BCH for an ASIC-resistant coin because any cryptocurrency dominated by ASIC mining is not decentralized."
"First, Core doesn't censor anything, you're conflating the moderation in /r/Bitcoin and the developers of an open source project.

Second, I'll run a LN node or two, just like thousands of other technically and economically smart people. Just like when it made sense for me to mine bitcoin myself, except now I don't have to keep buying expensive hardware, I just need to setup node(s) with commonly available things like computer components and internet connections.

I work in the networking/internet field and I'm very pessimistic about higher internet speeds being rolled out anytime soon. Raise the blocksize too much and there will be no more home nodes. Which means anytime I use Bitcoin I'd have to trust that my peers aren't lying to me, instead of just verifying the blockchain myself."
You can't project your ideology on others just because they've behaved similarly to you in certain cases.  You don't have to be a libertarian to object to censorship or exorbitant transaction fees.  You don't have to be anti-government to be anti-bankster. And plenty of people will have pushed their investments in the direction of BCH simply because they've lost faith in the fundamentals of Bcore and the implications of it as an investment.

"Adam Back's work is literally credited in the whitepaper...

Coinbase is good for adoption and the ecosystem, for sure. Never argued against that. But let's be real, when it comes to technical changes to the protocol, I would not bet on them."
Explain how BTC survives when absolutely all commerce BTC grinds to a halt due to $100 fees which would be the inevitable result if BCH and BTC prices get near parity (barring an emergency hard fork by BTC). It's not like any of the dynamics in play are mysterious, so ironically your claim sounds like wishful thinking. 
It's already happening iteratively. 70% of hashrate was on Bitcoin Cash side and only the last EDA saved Bitcoin Segwit from hurting further. A couple of exchanges were closed
Who give the idea to fund the Bitcoin developers so they can create a powerful central unit ?
One does not simply *install* gentoo
If you like Gentoo check out Funtoo, it's awesome.
"While Satoshi is not a god, discarding the whitepaper the first chance you get is also not wise. On-chain scaling can work for a long time, maybe even indefinetly. The tech is already there and by the time the demand arrives it'll be even more advanced. Just because some people claim that on-chain scaling doesn't work for whatever reason is no basis to completely disregard the originial vision and start on off-chain scaling solutions that are **patented** by the devs that proposed them.

Again, 100 MB blocks would see us through for a very long time and would hardly be an issue in regard to decentralisation, but for some reason some dude in a wooden shack out in the middle of nowhere needs to be able to run a full node and that's why we need SegWit and LN. How did that debate even derail to this point?"

"> Who is in control right now then?

Not the people Brian wants, thats for sure. Heres a better question, why doesn't coinbase support BCH until January, why doesnt Coinbases announcement today of Coinbase Custody mention Bitcoin Cash? Why does it just say Bitcoin and Ethereum on the website instead?

These little small things matter. Position BCH as the first named currency and leave BTC to be included under ""and more"" instead of the other way around. Support BCH and trade it now and kick BTC to the curb instead of the way it is now if you really feel that way.

"The people who say you can't upgrade the transaction limit. 

This bus is heading for a cliff the driver the developers are not in control they don't make the tiers nor do they mine the ore thats used to make the metal part that drive the motor.

The driver is in control of the bus even though he doesn't make or pay for the fule.

When you ask the driver who's in control of everything that comes together at any moment he tells you it's complicated everyone and no one is in control. He's just driving the bus.

He made a roadmap that goes nowhere and he says the passenger decide where the bus should go.

Everyone is OK.

Now 4 years ago someone noticed a cliff in the distance. The bus driver said don't worry we will turn befor then.

4 years later more passenger say we are headed for a clif just look.

The bus driver said it's not a cliff unless we all agree it's a cliff. Anyway I've made changes so the bus can fly.

And if you are confused look at my roadmap. 

Some of the passengers who paid for a front row seat said we've looked at everything this bus can't fly and we are going over a cliff. 

The developers said if you can convince everyone on the bus to turn then we can turn.

The passengers who paid for the front row seats said ok. And started to explain to the other passengers what was happening. 

The developers said new rules no talking in the bus. So forget r/bitcoin the very back row of the bus. I'm talkig about IRC where people talk to the bus driver.

The front row passengers who criticized the roadmap got a sock shoved in their mouths and hounded by passengers who said the rules of the bus say no talking.

But we headed for a cliff. No we are not they said we are just limiting capacity of the bus so we can fly to the moon. Just get off if you don't like it.

But that's a clif we're headed for a cliff and there are no jet engines or wings we can't fly.

Trust the bus driver they say. 

But he's not in control we are. 

Eventually you convince everyone that if you turn 20 degrees to the left it'll take a little longer before you go of the cliff. 

Everyone agrees expect the bus driver who is not in control he refused to listen and told everyone he's been driving this bus long enough to know what's hapening. 

He's not turning and you better get off at the next stop.

At the next stop the store owner sees this bus he's never seen anything so fantastic befor. The developers tells him how it works and how he is not in control and if you want on you just need a ticket. 

There are not enough tickets so you can just give anyone on bus enough of whatever they want and they'll get off. And please do I'm sick of the complaining. 

And so we head for a cliff the driver ignoring all the problems he refused to turn say everyone needs to agree and when everyone agrees he refused to agree as he is also a pasanger and probably the most important one.

Some investor disagreed and made a copy of the bus a replica in every way just the driver if he comes on board has to accept the investors hav turned 45 degrees to avoid the cliff and we're now going somewhere nicer. "

Or that the idea of it being deflationary was to prevent stuff like having your retirement/savings account evaporate from inflation?

"Even though you’re just trolling, and nothing anyone says will change your goal of disrupting the sub, I will reply:

Bitcoin is at $7800. You’re correct. But it should be at 15,000 or higher, which is exactly where it would be, if it hadn’t been completely smashed by the core Dev team over the last five years. 

We lost a massive amount of market share to ETH during the first “flippening” when congestion finally reached max capacity.  

And now we’ve lost even more market share to BCH and other Alts for the same reason.  All related to bitcoin failing as a cheap, fast transfer of value.  It’s original and main purpose.  And for no good reason except that (as Brian points out in this article) Core has some agenda. 

Tokyo announced BTC as a currency which is what shot us to the stratosphere back in April 2017. Not sure if you paid attention to that...  people started using it for commerce.

Technology can struggle as peer to peer cash, and still be a good store of value and 1000 other things.  One of bitcoin‘s greatest features is that it was supposed to be so many different things. 

But you can be assured that it’s at a significantly lower price right now than it would be, had it been allowed to flourish properly. 

Now:  Please go ahead and say something snarky and aggressive and useless like a 12-year-old bully on a playground.  "
For someone who was cited in the whitepaper it sure took him a long time to catch on. Man that must sting. 
Very simple. When fees are that high, miners will mine and pick them up. Since no one uses BTC for actual use cases anyway (no one buys coffee with BTC- the fees are too high), you need not worry about tons of transactions trapped in the meme pool. Most transactions in the memepool will just be spam, getting in the way of actual transactions of users wanting to buy, sell, or move BTC through their wallets. But, there is no network issue of it getting backed up, because no one uses the network to buy stuff.
BTC commerce never really existed though.
Why does BCH crew think anyone in the real world gives a shit about BTC commerce?  If you think commerce in the TOTAL CRYPTOSPHERE even justifies the valuation of something 1/100th BTCs size you’re actually insane. 
https://twitter.com/monsterbitar/status/931035212733206529
This used to be a thing with BTC too (back when there was only one), but fees got too high for it many years ago.
I don't listen to other people on reddit.  I have followed the developers, github repos, governance forums/mailing lists, and general research of roadmaps.  I come to my own conclusions because I have a passion for the crypto world and have been following it and using it since 2009.  Reddit is the absolute worst place to listen to anybody on this subject.  But all conclusions are my own after many many years of research.  I HIGHLY recommend everyone else do the same thing and ignore reddit entirely on both sides.

Are you even aware of that? Are you new here?

So pick your poison. Do you want bitcoin to remain a decentralized ledger around the world where it’s transactions are on a decentralized ledger that can’t be shut down? 

Or do you want to pull all of its transactions off chain so block stream can make a shit ton of money selling lightning hubs to banks who then are in control of Bitcoin?  

Do you want banks to control bitcoin? Because that’s what lightning brings us.  Do you actually think they’re not supporting this, so that bitcoin does not completely destroy their industry?

"Yes, thank you. Utility is necessary to ensure true value in the long run, and with the way BTC’s transactions and fees are set up now, it’s practically useless as a digital currency. If BitCoin has no utility, then people are going to feel that all they really have are expensive invisible Beanie Babies.

Call me crazy, but it’s pretty obvious to me that BitCoin Cash solves these issues relative to the BitCoin Network; it’s really much simpler than people are making it out to be."
TIL
I bet more of these are core than you'd believe. The dragonsden army is real
"You guys are nuts...or just trying to steal the bitcoin brand. ""Bcash"" rolls off the tongue: Bitcoin Cash does not. Accept it, because it will be used unironically if 'bch""  does go big."
Then please use bch instead of bcash. It's even shorter and easier to use bch. Thank you.
I think paying all the poor people more money would be easier than getting core to budge.
"> Right now bitcoin is definitely still breathing, and breathing quite well.

Bitcoin as a speculative asset class is ""breathing"" quite well ... I'm sure people said the same about tulips just before the tulip bubble bursted.  Bitcoin as a means of payment is not breathing well at all.  

I just read a fresh paper written by some consulting company yesterday, speculating that the Bitcoin value would be worth more than half a million in the future if it would take over a big majority of the payments.  The word ""payments"" was repeated over and over in the paper - not a single mention of the capacity limit there.  That's the major reason for the price growth, I think - most people out there aren't aware of the limitations, they just want to join in on the ride.  Bitcoin has become just yet another HYIP/Ponzi, it works and people may get insane returns on investments ... all until it doesn't work anymore.

The 1 MB limit is like putting a strict limit that your baby can only eat 300 grams of food and water every day.  I suppose it may have some security purpose, like preventing the nanny from overfeeding the baby.  However, as the baby grows of course it needs more than that!  Then there is the ""slippery slope""-argument, we certainly cannot afford feeding the little one with 500 kg of food every day, hence we cannot allow the 300 gram limit to be lifted!

To get beyond visa-level transaction volumes, we clearly need both to increase the limit, work on optimizations in the software and work on ways to optimize the data volume going into the blockchain itself (i.e. lightning).

Payment systems are very much dependent on the network effect.  We can have the best technology in the world, but it's kind of useless if your peers are still accepting nothing but paper money.  I think PGP is a good analogy, it was really impressive technology back in 1991 ... that's more than 25 years ago, and I still send emails in plain text as my peers don't support any kind of email encryption ... and ever so often my peers demands me to ""sign"" documents by printing out a paper, put my name on it in writing, and scan it again ... jeez.  Even worse, we have a government-approved digital signature system here in Norway, owned by the banks ... the banks distribute the tokens, the banks keeps the private keys, and ""signing"" a document can be done merely by reading it at the computer screen and then handing over a one-time-token and a password.  I'm quite sure that we would have had a proper decentralized secure global digital signature mechanism approved by most of the jurisdictions by now if just PGP adoption would have reached a critical mass back in the early 90s.

"That's not how most pressing symptoms work. Not most distressful, most important. If you don't treat problems with the airway, breathing or circulation, the patient WILL die. If treating the symptom will result in death, it's up to the individual/family (in this case community) to decide if treatment is worth extending life.

Bitcoin is breathing in terms of price. Fundamentally, it's as weak as it has ever been. "
Fixing bitcoin as peer-to-peer cash is not going to kill it. You actually think improving its utility is going to harm it? You guys are unreal with your trolling.

Not sure when they added it, but I've already bought games with BTC on steam. They're using BitPay so basically they only get the $ value paid out, but in the end you can still pay for games with BTC on steam, which is not feasable right now due to the high fees.
It's not the number of transactions that is the issue but the number of inputs. But the quadratic validation problem is a solved one and has already been implemented on Core (for Segwit transactions only) and Cash (for all transactions).
Pretty much all of them. Do you run a full node? Do you monitor CPU usage? Cause I do. On a crappy VM on a 10 year old server then runs about 10 other VMs. CPU usage rarely get over 90% idle on the Bitcoin VM.
For that we'd nee to know how much computational capacity would be needed to work through that. If you have more inside on the topic I'm actually curious, maybe I'm underestemating 100 MB blocks because I'm missing something.

I don't think Coinbase is really enthusiastic about BCH.   Their support seems begrudging and they really love ETH.   Kim Dotcom may not be a good choice for your brand ambassador either: he could easily get shipped off to prison any day.

Yes, money needs divisibility and it goes without saying that part of that is the ability to split 10000 units of one to buy a coffee into 99998 and 2 for coffee, not 99898 with 2 for coffee and 100 for fees.
"If you understand encomy. Gold has value merely because it is rare and scarce. For example any famous painting, it worths money because it is scarce, it does not worth anything for normal people but it worth billion of dollars among the rich. Same to bitcoin, it will always be valued by bitcoin community not matter you like it or not.

Since we cannot use btc to buy coffee, I will use alt coin or bch as a currency at this moment. Bitcoin will be my asset (or currency in the future)."
Yeah, I bought Terraria on Steam for my kid when the jump from 4-5k happened, paid $10 with a $2.50 fee, about half of it was profit so I paid ~$6.25 in fiat.  The thing is, you used to be able to wait for a lower fee eventually, non peak times, etc. which are becoming less often.   Now, it's a $8 fee and I wouldn't buy anything under $100.
Bitpay accepts zero confirmation transactions, so getting in the next block really doesn't matter for this particular use case - so you can put a low fee and still buy games.
Right, I’m a beginner in this space, as well, but, listening to things on aantonop’s youtube channel has been quite helpful in getting a better understanding of the issues in blockchain technologies, in general.  Specifically, the Delivering Liberty at Scale talk...
Nice!  I spent 5 full days on google campus this year in their machine learning course, using GCP and tensorflow.  They taught us how to rebuild the Uber price estimation algorithm from scratch, using NY taxi data from a 20 year span.  ML is also high as fuck salary so you will do quite well I'm sure.
"Um, no. Not at all. Housing bubble due to greedy investors who were giving $500k+ loans to deadbeats (like my friend) on shit hole houses. Loans with payments that were super affordable for a year or two and then quadrupled or more.
Maybe you're too young to have been there to see it first hand, but there was a lot of shady logic defying stuff going on. Anytime anyone pointed it out the mantra was ""old economic theory is dead...it's a new era...""
They were of course wrong. "
As usual, you speak without knowing what you’re talking about. The Kim project is being run by several people. None of which have any problems with the law. And regardless of Kim’s history, he still has a 40 million user base and they will be using BCH. Users and adoption is the point. Sorry to kill your dreams of BCH dying. But reality sometimes smacks us in the face whether we like it or not.
"i don't need to read up on it. i don't think blockchain is just tulip seeds - but a cryptocurrency that can't actually be used any more and is just used for speculation is turning more and more into it.

tulip mania had more and more speculators not interested in tulips at all enter the market, there were futures markets back then, and no tulip seeds actually changed hands any more...  see where this could be heading?

also this does not mean omg sell it all now or something - could go to crazy highs before."
"a million dollar painting to a rich person only has value among the social cultures in which such a painting enhances that persons social status.

RemindMe! 3 months"
"> paid $10 with a $2.50 fee, about half of it was profit so I paid ~$6.25 in fiat

No, you paid $12.50 in fiat.  Your net from abstract numbers in the past is some crazy mental hoops.  The item cost $10 in today price and you paid 25% over the regular price of an item because of BTC chain backlog and high fees.  

This is why Steam, like all merchants, will move to a chain with minimal fees and consistent confirmation times."
until the network is so big that smaller fees never go through and then what? This doesn't seem like a practical solution if the network grows by any noticable margin.
I was just confused, because this was the first time I heard that the processing of blocks could be an issue. Usually it's storage space and download speeds, both of which are really not going to be a problem for enough people to ensure a decentralised network for at least the next couple of years.
Well, yes, but there’s also block [transaction] validation that needs to happen for each block.
"Well true, but isn't that just a bunch of data that needs to get parsed? I mean it's not heavily encrypted data that need a lot of processing power to decrypt, right? That's only for finding the block.

Parsing though gigabytes of data shouldn't be a problem with current day CPUs especially if that task can be multi-threaded. "
thats probably what people in the tulip mania said as well.
 But, continuing the analogy, what if treating the most pressing symptom, actually worsens the disease and dooms the patient. Right now bitcoin is definitely still breathing, and breathing quite well. ATH. To potentially risk it's life because it's not quite breathing insanely well, is not the best clinical plan. 
"Institutional investors thing in long-terms; the shortest acceptble term being 3 or 5 years depending on context. Zoom out to a 5 year view and it's immidiatly obvious to any institutional investor that the corret time to enter the market is after the current bubble burst.

When the bubble bursts though, the will never be able to do so; because BTC will cease to exist."
"> Who is ""we""?

Coinbase.  BitPay.  Kim dot com and his 40 million subscribers who will be using Bitcoin Cash to power the upcoming Bitcache system.  

Literally tens of thousands of individual users. Other major players in the industry that core has completely shit on verbally, and professionally. 

You have no idea how much of this industry is sick of your shit.

It’s cute you guys actually believe this is just “Roger and Jihan“. Does that help you dismiss everything if you think it’s only two people? The delusion and denial you guys live under is unbelievable."
"Its the classic American double standard: say one thing, do something different.

Politicians and businessmen have been doing it for years. Profit drives action, and they aren't a nonprofit company.

My hunch, and wager, is once BTC proves it is failing, and BCH proves it is winning, their tune will change."
I'm similarly distributed 50/50 only because of the majorities and market positioning... And I do know that not as many people spend hours per day on research and development as I do.  I try to help dispel some myths here and there with sources to back it up where I can, only to help everyone make informed decisions.  I know a lot of people simply don't have that kind of time to invest in the research.  It's a shame there aren't more reputable source aggregators out there, I am considering starting a blog that documents all of my research with sources/citations if not for my own benefit to be able to go back and cross reference.  And maybe it'll help others eventually.
"> I will support the majority simply because I'm not educated enough in this space to have a relevant opinion.

And yet you wrote nearly 8 paragraphs of “opinion“ when you admittedly don’t even know what you’re talking about. 

Maybe you could temper how much you speak, given the fact that you don’t know what you’re talking about. 

Especially refrain from telling ***others*** that they are the ones brainwashed by BCH. 

How about that idea?

We have found that the majority of core proponents are brand new to crypto and don’t have a clue how this whole thing played out. They’re just believing what they’re being told on a sub that is globally known to censor dissenting opinions. And ban people who disagree. 

Think about that for a bit before you pick your side in this debate.  It had a profound effect on where I leaned in the beginning.  "
I appreciate what your saying, but honestly all of that is wasted on me.  I'm only here for the riches.
"Hah dork!  BCH is dumb and so are you! 

J/K

I appreciate the history lesson.  But...  I'm not sure why you're trying to explain this to me.  I assume you were following along this little thread or whatever.  I believe it started with me commenting on the fact that OP found a blog post from a year and a half ago, and I pointed out how well BTC has done since then.   I also mentioned I don't care so much about the cult side of these coins.  I'm here for the investment opportunity, so far I've done pretty well.  

Again I appreciate you educating me,  and maybe this is good for noobs to read, but a little lost on me.  I like BTC, I see BCH as a cheap knockoff, and I really like ETH.  I have grown fond of a few others but have'nt invested in them yet."
How do you know when he bought in?
"> Since no one uses BTC for actual use cases anyway

This is exactly the reason why #BitcoinCore have failed and will be left behind. You can't have a store of value without value; and we will not be coming back now that we've finally regained sovreignty."
Price will fall then flow og money is what makes a market
Gold coins were used for a long time as currency
"> Since no one uses BTC for actual use

It has no future then"
"This is a lie; bitpay have signed up more than 150,000 merchants with payment processing and I have personally used bitcoin for payment.

Large vendors such as newegg, microsoft, overstock and steam all accept bitcoin and I haven't done a single payment to steam that wasn't bitcoin since the day they released their support for it. (and I'm a gamer)"
Lies steam is a good example of highvolume btc you do need Them if there is only speculators the price will tank
"Are you serious? lol

Just the drug deals alone have been immense

Not to mention obvious things like egifter. Which is unusable now because of the fees and timing. (an app that converts btc to giftcards for quite a few american chains, you won't eat great but you'll eat if you need it)

Was useful for cashing out"
"Sure! Well, you start out by googling ""Ubuntu"" then you follow those steps and voila!

OHHHH wait, Gentoo.... Not sure I can give an eli5. Something something compile error "
A lot? 100MB isn't really that much.
No. Just another Core troll hanging out here trying to rewrite history.  It’s what they do best. 
[deleted]
"Who is ""we""? The BCH faithful who wanna buy coffee with crypto? Get over it dude, the institutional money is about to slam into BTC. They do not care about use case, except for store of value. Old economic theories are being eradicated now. "
"nobody ""uses"" btc because everybody knows price is going up. fiat cash has inflation for that reason - to increase spending!  btc with its coin limit is an excellent store of value for this reason, and everybody who pays for a coffee with it today should know that he could buy a lot more with the same amount in the future. -> store of value"
But it does have value... 8 times as much value as BCH
"Value is what people make it.

Use cases are pretty irrelevant.  Gold has value that way outstrips the value of its practical applications."
If 10 people use 10k to buy it, it will have 10k value among those people. This is how store of value works. The price can go down now because different people have diffrent buying price. Once all coins were purchased with $X, the value will not be lower than $X because nobody will sell below his buying price.
One word: GOLD
Yeah, hundreds and thousands of years ago, when people accepted waiting months for overseas purchases and could purchase their necessities locally
Steam accepts BTC? Since when?
It’s not about the memory footprint but about validating all the transactions inside 100MB block *fast*. This is 100 times the number of transactions that are there now. How many miners have that kind of computational capacity?
I'm also a software developer, I've actually been working in my spare time to develop blockchain tech so I'm pretty passionate about it, I'm actually about to quit my dev dayjob to do blockchain engineering fulltime because I like it that much.  So I have a lot of hope for the entire industry in general, not just bickering between each side and slander campaigns (which I hope does not harm the industry long term.)
"I remember hearing this *Old economic theory is dead"" argument a whole lot when talking about the housing market in 2007...."
This sounds like a new crisis in the making. If everyone just piles in money in hopes it gets bigger, without any backing at all since the only usecase is literally 'put in money and hope more people are doing likewiese' then it will blow up at some point.
"[Once Again: Scarce AND ""Useful""...!](https://www.yours.org/content/once-again--scarce-and--useful------c1b4ba555459)"
Sounds like it’s time wel take a look at why we are only paying them a few dollars a week????  Fucking capitalism!
"Nah I'm not going to shut up. I'm going to keep telling the truth. Core hasn't served up anything tasty since they staged a coup on the bitcoin repo.

I would buy coffee with crypto because I earn my money in crypto, and use crypto as money. Even if you don't earn your money in crypto you can always immediately rebuy whatever you spend in crypto.

I see crypto as valuable because it is useful, not just because I might be able to one day sell it to someone for more than I bought it for."
Yeah I meant bitcoin cash it's just shorter to type bcash or bch.  Like btc is short hand for bitcoin.   You obviously knew what I meant.
Published in March2016 .. imagine if you had dropped your coins by then and sold them .. gosh.. luckily I still believe in bitcoin

"Funny how Core opponents and Core supporters both apparently upvoted this comment for different reasons. One group upvoted because they think it being an old quote shows how true it is since the problems Coinbase pointed to have gotten far worse, and the other group upvoted because they think it being old makes it ""old news."""
And true to this day.

Didn't see that one at first, I became very concerned when I read that Coinbase is running at Bitcoin Classic.
Also the hypocrisy from core is amazing, they haven't even implemented Segwit into their wallet GUI for users to 'benefit' from it even though they invented and developed it. However they hold all these multimillion dollar companies to ridiculous standards and demand they implement immediately making them seem like the bad guys and relieving pressure off core when the big companies have all stated it takes time. They're a joke.

It's not a scaling solution in the first place anyway.
Relative noob. I don't understand. What do you by this? Why wouldn't they want bitcoin to scale? Confused AF! (pardon my French)
"> today Core is complaining that more people aren't using Segwit.

Citation needed."
I heard from a reliable source that as soon as you switch on Segwit, the scaling problems are solved immediately.
"I would like to follow him on twitter. what is the h tag? 

On jan 1st when coinbase software allows BCH. Do you think there will be a sell off for a lot of the customers who just get access to their free BCH? Or what do you think is going to happen. I dont know myself and asking opinions here"
He wrote this article over 4 months before the bcash fork even happened. 
They had better, or it makes him a big mouth thats all talk and no action. After reading all of that especially.
"The problem you, and like the CEO of Coinbase has, is that the Core developers have their own issues with simply scaling up to 2MB and beyond to keep things flowing. If we're using a doctor analogy, you want to treat the underlying illness, not the symptoms. That's the Core developers standing point. 

I know you guys don't have malicious intentions for the future of Bitcoin but I can say with confidence that the Coinbase CEO and people like Jihan Wiu just really want to make more money off people using their preferred coin. If the lightning upgrade solves all problems of scaling? Great! If the market moves to simple scaling from 2MB to 8MB and beyond and it works forever? Great, too! What I don't want to see is people like Jihan, people who want to piggyback off YOUR money, controlling the future of bitcoin. 

In saying that, I think we all want bitcoin to prosper, in whatever form it takes. "
It didn't stagnate. It was obstructed by a group of bankster funded people who don't hold bitcoin and have no personal interest in seeing it succeed.
Same. If it wasn't for core, we wouldn't even have ETH or BCH.
you should be happy that it's finally over then :)

"Yeah, what he predicted was only averted because of the spike in price.

So, the ONLY thing saving BTC now is the high rise in price.  Eventually, when it is too hard to trade, and the price levels or drops, it will lead to catastrophe."
"But. But.  Old article!  Brian just wants to pick the dev team himself!  Bitcoin price is high so bitcoin is fine as is!

Shows you how long this has been a problem, and exactly what happened that lead to the rise of Bitcoin Cash.  It’s an outstanding article.  
Old but informing, yes.
It’s important that people trying to rewrite history is stopped. This article shows a big part of why BCH came into existence. 
"I find the lack of sophisticated conversation and mature debate on the topic to be more troubling then what Brian is pointing out. There is a real issue in terming of scaling consensus that the ledger already weighs 150GB which needs to be discussed, and all I've seen is a wrestling match. Buying time is nice and all, though a premature hard fork will not help anybody.

Both sides need to come together to come to a consensus, that is the nature of Bitcoin. I hope that both sides of the picture can come together and make some basic compromises on when and how to perform a protocol upgrade."
Brian Armstrong outright REJECTED the Bitcoin Cash fork in the beginning and he's someone we listen to now? Are you guys delusional? And only when he saw the high demand and the endless possibilities did he jump on the wagon.
Yes, let's trust the coinbase CEO over some of the best crypto and OSS devs on the planet.
"Yeah Brian, Bitcoin was specifically designed to be immune to your attempts at controlling it. That's why with every failure to do so, the price skyrockets further.

"
"> One of the biggest risks of using segregated witness as a scaling solution (which was surfaced at the conference) is that to obtain the scaling benefit it will require not only new bitcoin core code, but also new code to be written by each of the major wallet providers who are generating transactions. It is unlikely this will be done in time to avoid the scaling issue we are currently facing.

Published March 2016, and today Core is complaining that more people aren't using Segwit. I wonder why."
This article gives me hope that Coinbase will support Bitcoin Cash starting in January. His recent tweets regarding Bitcoin Cash are an optimistic sign too. If Coinbase offers direct selling of Bitcoin Cash that will help adoption tremendously.
This only solidifies my belief that when coinbase opens up BCH it won't just simply be a wallet service. They understand that survival involves addressing the problems of now. If you're a doctor, you treat difficulty breathing first, not diabetes. 
It's sad to see bitcoin scaling stagnate for so long
[deleted]
Buying BCH with fiat is coming to Coinbase, the only question is when.  This guy has said way too many favorable things about BCH.  Once BCH is on Coinbase, it is over for BTC.  Too many people will see how much cheaper and faster BCH is to use.  And Coinbase is one of the many companies that want fast and cheap BTC transactions, because it benefits their business.
SPOF = single point of failure
Almost 2 years old article but it describes the current situation fully now 
Countdown to Coinbase listing BCH!
"Translation:

YEP, this is over a year old
"So, when did the fiat value of a coin become the only metric that anyone is supposed to look at or care about?

It's kind of funny how much lip service and noise people make about wanting to replace fiat with a usable, fungible currency but then their actual actions are all about whatever drives the fiat price up, and not actual network performance or public adoption.

This is transparently hypocritical."
Then find a team to write better code and implement a hardfork, period.  Otherwise, quit bitching, sit back and enjoy the massive returns that have been generated by the code that they have implemented.  
that did put some nectar in my ears, and molten iron in r/bitcoin ears
The current Core team didn't help much.
"Thanks for posting this. I had recently decided to look into the Reddit and medium posts of the core devs to try to get a read on them from first hand sources. My conclusions were largely in line with this article. Can't believe it took me so long to realize this...

I encourage anyone reading this to go look at the Bitcoin GitHub repo, find the top contributors over the last 6 or 12 or 18 months, and check out their online presence. Look at what they're saying, but also pay attention to what they're not saying. I was surprised to find that almost none of them used their online platforms to discuss scaling. It's just not on their minds..."
"This is an excellent article.  Companies like coinbase must be sick of the lack of common sense, and the demonization.  I like the last part as well:

> There continues to be rampant censorship on https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoin regarding this debate, which is unfortunate. I continue to encourage everyone to move to https://www.reddit.com/r/btc as an alternative that is censorship free. Thank you."
"Mar 4, 2016 when this was written - 

BTC  - $421

Fast forward to today -

BTC -  $7800

Boy did core fuck that one up,  right Brian?

Good try r/btc with a blog post from a year and a half ago.  Hows that working for you?  Blah blah blah - we arent in it to make money!  Were here to save the world by buying them coffee!  Bunch of dishonest phonies I say"
Nice write-up for sure.
Sad how the worst case scenario happened.. this was seen a long time ago and I bet core is just happy the price of BTC is rising to justify their stubborn decision to keep things their way. I suppose this will be how it feels like once we are living climate change's worst case scenario.. sad thing will be that while the rest of the world suffers, the ones who caused it will be safe and sound and taking none of the blame.  
"As someone new to the cryptocurrency community, thank you, this is a really good blog post. I do believe that something is wrong with BTC at a fundamental level since everyone seems to be ignoring pretty legitimate concerns. However please note that if you think this guy has a legitimate and reasonable opinion, he **doesn't** think that bigger blocks is the long term solution. I don't think he will be supporting Bitcoin Cash if the people behind it think they came up with the end all solution. I hope some people can put their ego aside and get to work. 

Also, having someone like him acknowledge censorship on r/bitcoin even months ago speaks volume. I hope that this subreddit can become a welcoming community for debates regarding the long term future of Bitcoin, which in my opinion it isn't right now. I feel like since what happened a week ago, people that don't think that BCH is BTC or that it is the future are not welcome here and their opinion are disregarded. Of course it's not as problematic as full on censorship but getting downvoted to hell doesn't advance the debate."
This is wrong, core developers have never helped anything that can be materialized, they created several fork incidents and fixed them, that's all. code maintainer typically do nothing important

>btc1 nodes stuck on block 494782 even though the fork was supposed to occur on block 494784. Turns out @jgarzik can’t even trigger a hard fork without messing things up! Shame on the companies that wanted to damage a $100B network by trusting this idiot.

They need to mine a block larger than 1MB for the fork to occur using btc1node software but since garzik is so incompetent it froze 1 block earlier than expected.

"We did find a better team and they did implement a hardfork.

I am much less concerned about gains then I am about changing the world for the better. If you are only concerned about the price of bitcoin then you are missing the point."
The current core devs aren't the best. They are latecomers who took over the project from the ones who birthed bitcoin and made it into what it is today. They are riding Satoshi/Gavin/Hearn/Finney/etc's wave. Core took something that was working great and broke it, splitting the community in the process.

I want decentralized cryptos to prosper, that's the big idea. Block size increases will increase the centralization of full nodes, more and more users will be unable to participate in preserving the ecosystem, which will decay under increasing centralization. We only have to look at the mortgage crisis of 2008 to understand the dangers of profound market manipulation and centralization: not only the debasement of currency and loan-making, but the undermining of basic morality too (i.e. selling shitty financial instruments as AAA bonds). Let's not go there with cryptos, it will fail.  
The whole idea of a 'official Bitcoin website' is wrong. Bitcoin.org is astroturfing for banksters.
Let’s see if u/memorydealers will help by highlighting their support on bitcoin.com. 
I don't want BTC to die, but the development team behind it is the one killing it.  I hold my BTC from the last few years only because people value it without understanding why.  I'm going to continue to hold it while the general population is unaware of its loss of utility.  As soon as people start migrating to more usable stores of value, I'll begin to slowly sell it off.
Very much this. I think many people here have made the flawed assumption, that people (currently) buy crypto to transact with it. The tiny minority that actually use it, all congregate here, leading to an insulated bubble, where people begin to think that the fees and such actually matter to most users. Bitcoin is not more valuable than other coins due to superior tech, the value is almost completely socially derived.
Back to the den with ya, troll
I see one outdated point in the article, what do you think is wrong with ti?
"Shut the hell up.  If you wanna change the world then you write the code.  Otherwise, eat the food that core is serving and enjoy your full belly.  Building a store of value is what will change the world, not being able to buy a cup of coffee.  Plus, who in their right mind would use Bitcoin or Bitcoin cash to buy coffee.  If you think BCH is going to $10000 per coin great, that still makes you an absolute fool to buy coffee with it at these prices.  That means if it does do to $10k you will be paying approx $50 for that $5 cup of coffee now.  Absolutely mind boggling stupid to do.  Jensen ""HODL"".  "
Thanks, good remark
"lol don't put that bullshit on me. I personally don't give a flying fuck about replacing fiat with blah blah blah.  My sole purpose in crypto is an investment. 

 Without a traditional retirement plan, I hope to dump what little money I have into various cryptos and hope they become worth more in the future.  Sorry I'm not a multi-millionaire like Ver, and can worry about starting my own country and taking care of the coffeeless kids around the world while teaching them of the virtues of voluntarism.  I am selfish and greedy and am only trying to make a buck. BTC and ETH have performed better than  I could have ever expected."
Oh no!   That's killing me inside.  It really is.  Its a shame that there isn't some 1300 other cryptos out there.  This isn't fucking highlander.
"Yup.  Thats why BTC went from $420 to $1k, and then to $2k, etc. etc. etc.

"Haha $20 million is why bitcoin is at 7k?

You mean... one SIX-THOUSANDTH of Bitcoin’s market cap?"
Yes that's the one, Silly core people can't pronounce it correctly.

"> As the value of bitcoin has increased 15+ fold since the article was published. Show me the failure

You guys are unbelievable with your cluelessness. The price of bitcoin has gone up because people are hoarding it, and hoping that it will go up higher and they will make money. 

We are discussing it’s actual purpose for existence. Peer to peer digital cash. 

It fails at its own basic, original purpose. That’s where the failure is. You know that. You don’t have to ask. 

Bitcoin is in an outstanding position to continue to increase value because of its Halvings, and its popularity in a social sense. 

We are fighting for its ***utility as digital cash***. Two completely separate things. Don’t mix them. They’re unrelated."
"Bitcoin takes 17 hours to move, and costs $10. 

You call that a better position than taking five minutes to move, and two cents? 

Have you been brainwashed by the backwards land /r/bitcoin or are you just another Core troll?"
And I know you mean well, but I believe our definitions of bitcoin prospering are two different things. The poor and the unbanked, the original final target of btc, cannot access it, unlike before. I am a firm believer that value comes from utility and a fee market makes that inaccessible to those who live in countries that only make a few dollars a week.
Is it? I suppose you only look at the btc price in fiat? If that's the only metric which is important to you, then yes Bitcoin is much better off than a year ago. Until this bubble pops

"Exactly. Ignore the elephant in the room. The proclamation of Bitcoins doom all those months ago, and yet it powered through it and survived just fine and continues on to this day despite predictions of its imminent failure unless it submitted to... someone's authority.

Any of that sounding familiar here all this time later on the day of the 8k ATH? I mean jesus, Im all for both coins having a future, but let's not kid ourselves here. All this really shows me is that the Coinbase CEO has LONG since wanted to personally handpick the team that decides bitcoin's future.... Unsurprisingly. He can either get in line behind the other thousand people that want more control over BTC or he can put his money where his mouth is and stop trading BTC on coinbase and replace it with BCH this January.

If that's what he really believes, support it with your business and your money. Otherwise hes just another pump faker trying to wrestle control away and failing, then retreating to his corner and falling in line."
I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you’re referring to as Bitcoin, is in fact, Blockstream Bitcoin, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, AXA/Blockstream Coin. AXA/Blockstream Coin is not Satoshi's vision, but rather a perversion of a fully functioning Bitcoin system made useful by the Bitcoin corelibs, utilities and other vital system components comprising a full digital payment system as defined by Satoshi.
This gives a lot of insight into November 26 and the chain death spiral theory. Maybe bitcoin will have a major bull run through the death trap yet again.
"Dude come on, the coinbase ceo had done nothing in the crypto space before coinbase:
https://www.linkedin.com/in/barmstrong/

Compare that to the blockstream CEO:
http://www.cypherspace.org/adam"
a year ago it wasn't facing systemic risks nor was it in a price bubble that attracts the attention of mainstream media once again calling it a ponzi (and this time being closer to the truth, as without utility the only value the coin has is to grow in value off the money from new investors)
You're off by a year, that article is from March **2016**
"The problem with you, and like the core supporters, miners are economically incentivized to make the most profit. It was taken into consideration from the initial formulation of bitcoins creation, along with on-chain scaling. (yeah it sounds kinda confrontational doesn't it?)

Seeing as I am in the above analogy, I treat the most pressing symptom first. It doesn't matter if I can cure the disease if the patient isn't breathing. Prioritization based on survival comes first. Complete eradication of diseases that take longer to treat come second."

Welcome to our sub, troll pretending to be “one of us”.  
This is an article from 2016.

Yes, the suit is blaming the workers.  Mismanaged workers.  High IQ workers, but worker bees nonetheless. 
"There’s an army of core trolls hanging out on the sub concern trolling, and pretending they are “one of us“ who just happened to “disagree“.

It's an overly generous equivocation though. Core developers refers two mostly distinct groups in the two parts of the sentence. 
... how is it true to this day? Bitcoin is arguably much better off than it was a year ago. 
As the value of bitcoin has increased 15+ fold since the article was published. Show me the failure, because it's not found in the market. Again folks: the tech details don't matter to most traders, they're just looking for the best value and bitcoin has shown that, of all cryptocurrencies, it has weathered the many forces of the internet.

Like I said, I'm not technically versed enough to know this for sure. So far it seemed to never be debated in the big block discussion so I assumed it to be a non-issue, but who knows?
Probably so they can put the blame on *lack of adoption* instead of having to confront the fact that it doesn't help the scaling problem much at all...
"> Also the hypocrisy from core is amazing, they haven't even implemented Segwit into their wallet GUI for users to 'benefit' from it even though they invented and developed it

"I would think there will be a huge sell off. Although if you remember a lot of people left coinbase rt before the fork nervous they would never get there BCH, so it could have been so much more BCH to hit the market. 

Also, the people who stayed at Coinbase were either,  1) Didnt believe in BCH so much they didn't care if they got any from their BTC. 2) Were ignorant about what the fork meant and Coinbase's position. Group 1 will prolly sell rt away. Group 2 will prolly hold out of ignorance and laziness. Who knows how many of each are in each group, but I dont think there are too many believers of BCH in either group. "
There's a good chance many will sell. On the other hand, BCH will have proven itself for longer by then and if it looks like it is on the up, more people might hold.

BTC can no longer capably compete with BCH for end users. BCH will be faster, easer to adopt, and less expensive to transact no matter what happens from here on out. If BCH continues to find broader support into the foreseeable future, it really is just a matter of time before it knocks BTC off the throne.

If you notice, you weren't given an answer. Its just pretending like such a thing is impossible when we know it isn't. A strategy for winning that relies on the other side to fail a terrible strategy. Which is why the OP is right. We need to continue to improve BCH, its uses, use cases and adoption. This way even if BTC one day fixes its scaling problems BCH still has a purpose instead of being an orphan.

Its still early; but Im going to be watching like a hawk for this. Can the developers behind BCH keep an eye forward? Or will it all be shit flinging."

"The free market is never optimal, but it always tends to being optimal on the long term. That is due to human nature: human beings are not always the most rational, but they tend to be rational on the long term (or they usually die because of their illusions which makes it work).

BTC is much better right now at having accumulated marketing inertia and respect from major players. This does not mean that it is still a reasonable thing to think, but we have to admit that it is what most people do think right now. If you see such a discrepancy between reality and market, that is called an opportunity: you can invest in the future than no one else can see yet. Investing will help make other people notice it, and help the people who are already working on it by showing support. 

That's why we can make the liberating decision to put all our ressources behind BCH if we think that it's the best coin, and let people be free to still buy and work with btc if they see value in it. Time and reality will sort it out. Illusions can look very convincing but they all end as deception when reality catch you up."

It is not about embracing both. It is about to just not give a fuck about all this fight and just concetrate on creating the best money there is and leave all the toxicity behind. It will eventually eradicate itself.
A win would be a dominate crypto that has no censorship and reasonable fees.  A win would mean banks would lose their monopoly.  BS is currently a block to those potential wins.  If BS changes their stance on censorship and solves the fee problem, that's a win.  If BTC fails and BCH takes over as the dominate crypto, that's a win.  If some other crypto that has reasonable fees and does not censor takes over, that's a win.
We’re a network for payment. Essentially a commodity. It’s not the same thing. Apple does things differently than windows. It’s a different experience. Most of us use the exact same wallet UI for Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Core. The only difference being the transaction fees. The network effect of payment networks will be tremendous. I think there will be one winner and I should be the original bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash. 
It would be good if there were per-account links, with accounts being password protected.

That's a very good idea to promote the possibilitys of BCH :) 
"Someone should fund the creation of a few ""Mac vs. PC""-like ads but with ""Bitcoin Cash vs. Bitcoin Segwit"" people. They were fun."
I wonder how many people actually have tried running a full node.  Even with BTC chain, I spent literally weeks trying to download and process the blocks on my i7 laptop.  Never happened and I had to give up and use Electrum instead. 
What a powerful and well reasoned response.
"double post ;)"
"My understanding is they can't seize coins, only delay the transaction for an extended time or prevent it. 

How could they be seized? Once the channel is forced to close you get your money back? "
"Should be added: a bitcoin Cash user is a user in front of law. A Lightning Network user is a lender in front of U.S. law and is responsible for each and any transaction he's part of and is accountable for each transaction 24h/24 that passes through him.

> Not some cool anarchist cyberpunk underground payment network.

Not to break the narrative, but that's exactly why Satoshi developed Bitcoin in the first place and why Bitcoin's white paper was released 2 weeks after 2008's financial crisis exploded.

Let's accept a fact: fiat money works, is consumer friendly. It takes 3 days generally, if not less, to transfer money around the globe.

The core principle of crypto currencies is to detach their logic from fiat, not to embrace them and get overly stressed on how much our whatever coin is worth in fiat.

If Bitcoin's use is to get hand in hand with fiat then it's no real alternative and is extremely weak in case governments decide to tackle it (as China proved it to be).

I profited out of cryptos, but at some point, the more I think and reason about it we're totally forgetting what the real purpose and use of cryptos is: an alternative to fiat and the ""corrupt banks and government"".

Ask yourself, what is going to happen the day more countries ban exchanges and will make impossible to swap fiat for cryptos?

I fear that only the anarchist (or better, libertarians) will remain and cryptos will be one of the biggest failed experiments humanity has seen."
Is BTC-Bitcoin supposed to represent the cypherpunk crowd? From my reading, they seem to span regular 9-to-5 folks with Wallstreet investors, all trying to save for early retirement. It looks like BCH-Bitcoin has the backing of the real crypto underground now, where money is actually in motion. What that portends, who can really tell?
"Figuratively is the correct answer here. 

I doubt that many bitcoin owners literally have a Lamborghini but they have made so much profit with bitcoin that they don't really care if they can easily buy a cup of coffee or not."

"It's also not about the amount you're sending but the size of the tx in bytes. You should have said ""My transaction with 2 inputs and 2 outputs cost me $1.60"" That gives me more relevant data to convince me.

But what he doesn’t address is btc is already centralized since mining is out of hands of cpu or Gpu. It’s an existing problem that we inherited after the fork. 

He probably wants offchain Lightning scaling. I think that kind of solution is still bottlenecked by the inevitable slow onchain transactions these networks will have to do.

"> Because on-chain scaling leads to greater centralisation, which weakens Bitcoin's censorship resistance.

That message is repeated often but repetition doesn't establish validity. There is no evidence that a bigger block size will cause any form of centralization."
Never got convinced by that argument. What convinced you?
"On-chain scaling does not lead to greater centralization. Furthermore, BCH can handle layer 2 uses as well. Unfortunately, the blocksize bottleneck is currently a major weakpoint for Bitcoin.

Also, I'm curious if Core or anyone actually done a stress test with full blocks and looked at possible attack vectors that become feasible with constantly full blocks before deciding against a blocksize increase?"
"That may not be true.

Also, forcing most people onto the 2nd layer, a permissioned payment system, will utterly destroy censorship-resistance. Governments will be able to regulate companies running nodes on Lightning, may be able to enforce blacklists of what coins are allowed to be moved or not, may be able to seize funds from users, etc., etc."
"According to this, Bitcoin Cash is neither a centralized nor a decentralized network.  It is a ""Small World Network"".

https://medium.com/@ProfFaustus/the-trouble-with-too-much-of-anything-f1a41545ee51

Need to ask yourself one thing...  If a single miner goes down, what's the chance of broadcasting your transactions? (It's 100%).  If a single hub goes down in the LN, what's the chance of broadcasting your transaction?...  (It all depends, but it's not 100%...  especially if it's the intermediary you need between you and the person you're paying).  Which one of these models fits your definition of decentralization more?

> The current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale.  That would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server.  The design supports letting users just be users.  The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be.  Those few nodes will be big server farms.  The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don't generate.  ~ Satoshi Nakamoto (2010-07-29)

We are talking about a GLOBAL payment system here...  Not some cool anarchist cypherpunk underground payment network.  Not every individual needs to run a node."
"Thank you for your comment. I understand your concern, but I will attempt to show step-by-step why your concern is unfounded.

The idea that on-chain leads to greater centralization comes from the idea  that ""full nodes"" are important for most people to run, which comes in part from the idea that these clients allow greater security or ""sovereignty"" for ones transactions than simplified payment verification (SPV) wallets, which comes from the idea that SPV as described in Section 8 of the whitepaper requires fraud proofs in order to function as originally intended, which comes from the idea that the phrase ""[SPV] is more vulnerable when the network is overpowered by an attacker"" in that section refers to a majority attack rather than a minority attacker, which in some interpretations makes it seem that it is referring to an attack scenario where a majority hashpower miner is mining invalid blocks. But this scenario would contradict Bitcoin の fundamental premise, that miners are ""honest"" in the sense of being rationally profit-seeking, so it cannot be the intended interpretation. The intended interpretation must therefore be that ""[SPV] is more vulnerable when the network is overpowered by an attacker"" refers to a *minority* hashpower attacker. That is, a malicious and non-profit-driven-miner who, rather than seeking the much more viable approach of attempting a doublespend attack (which uses perfectly valid blocks), decides to try a much less viable atack: they try to mine an invalid block (such as one with extra block rewards). In the scenario Satoshi refers to, they as a minority miner has gotten very lucky and has managed to mine several blocks in a row before any other miner had mined any blocks. 

Under this scenario, an SPV wallet is temporarily fooled for a few blocks whereas a ""full node"" wallet is not. Thus the SPV wallet user must wait for a couple addiitional confirmations if they are receiving a high-value transaction. However, after a few transactions, even the remote odds that a substantial minority miner may try such  an attack retreat into complete statistical insignificance. 

Since SPV nodes cryptographically verify that all transactions they receive are valid and in a block in the longest chain, they have complete financial sovereignty. For security they merely have to wait a couple additional confirmations to guard against a very unlikely edge-case attack that ""full nodes"" are nit vuknerable against. However, both ""full nodes"" and SPV wallets are equally vulnerable to the far more viable and likely doublespend attack, which means this security difference is both very marginal and also negated by waiting a couple of extra transaction.

Likewise, the idea that on-chain scaling via having most users run SPV wallets leads to centralization comes from the idea that ""full nodes"" are less vulnerable to attack, which comes from both the aforementioned misconception that ""full nodes"" offer significantly greater security than SPV wallets, as well as the idea that """"full nodes"" somehow help the network, which comes from the idea that Bitcoin is a mesh network requiring ""relays"" to assist in transaction propagation, which is incorrect because Bitcoin's network topology  is semi-complete ring constituting a Newman-Strogatz-Watts small-world network with what is known as  ""giant component"" (a.k.a. giant node) in the network-distance-wise center  of the network graph where the miners are,  with an average network  distance of only 1.32. What all this means is that  almost every new transaction on the network reaches almost  every miner in a couple of seconds, without any help from ""full  nodes."" In fact, ""full nodes"" slightly slow down propagation by functioning as a mild Sybil attack on  the mining network.

Bitcoin is thus unassisted by ""full nodes"" and all its censorship resistance and decentralization comes from miner decentralization and SPV's very solid (as explained above) cryptographic guarantees."

that's true, I'm holding to the next big pump
Unrestricted supply. Lack of immutability: tempering with the ledger, less work done to secure the ledger, plans on switching to PoS. Ethereum is a fuel for smart contracts, not sound money
"Well you are just lying lol.

I decided to make the move from my legacy wallet to a SegWit wallet last night, my transfer of ~$890 cost me $1.80.

Took about 20 minutes to confirm, this is from Legacy - not even utilizing SegWit.

Besides, if I wanted fast/cheap transactions instead of a value store I would use a non-destructive coin such as Litecoin or Ethereum which are actively trying to support and build the crypto community instead of trying to replace and damage our biggest source of newcomers, Bitcoin.

EDIT: https://blockchain.info/tx/8f7cd38c46af4a0aed07ce913bdfb7d2d72835d71f6940cd915945687b76fe19

I make small transactions all the time. No problem. A few of my wallets have less than half a coin."
"> What's wrong with Bitcoin finding a different place in the market 

Nothing, but we have the ask the question: why the change? People who have been around long enough have an idea why this change is being made and it's not good for bitcoin if you ask me."
Oh don't worry you were clear. It's just a shame in my view that BTC is the real Apple analog here. I still think it's a good idea, though the delivery was a lot of what made those ads so great. Will be hard to replicate.
Awful value proposition, and frankly I find it very clunky despite all the simplifications.
"No, on-chain scaling is the ONLY way to secure de-centralized settlement and de-centalized trust. 
LN, sidechains etc. is controlled by entities and hence you have to trust those entities, just like a bank. Which totally defies the whole point of Bitcoin in the first place. 
Also, the small blocker argument that everyone has to be able to run a full node, and therefore the blocks must be small is a mis-conception. There is NOTHING that prevents people from running a full node just because max blockssize is e.g. 8 MB like BCH. Besides Moores Law for storage and traffic will solve this for even larger blocks, easy. 
Besides test nets have already been run with as much as 1 GB(!) blocks. "
"I'd like to hear your logic for that statement, aside from ""it's what everyone over at /r/bitcoin and twitter say""."
And centralized development, censorship, and a one true Bitcoin attitude don't lead to centralization and abuse of power?
"You realize that the blockchain size of Bitcoin (162 Gigabytes) costs less to store than the fees on a single transaction?

A terabyte hard drive will safely store a decade of transactions for 35 $.

Yet none of you complains on how the network depends on mining farms and pools, which are very centralized.

Double standards?

Mind you, I'm no fan of either Bitcoin nor Bitcoin Cash as I'm no fan of any Proof of Work coin (they all promote centralization in a way or another, plus I'm against using so much energy to validate transactions) but the argument for not scaling block size is pure bullshit especially since the very nature of LN will lead towards centralized hubs that will require fees for routing regardless.

This at the price of no longer making transactions p2p.

Lightning Network, if it works, is the weakest answer Bitcoin Core could develop (potentially illegal) to scale the scalability issue.

What both these communities fail to accept is that the different narratives are more pushed due to economical stakes than real technological issues."

"The lightning network was 18 months away two years ago. It was 18 months away 6 months ago. It's 18 months away right not.

Bitcoin SegWit has a centralized and banker funded development team ensuring you will never get scalability. Don't believe me? Wait another year and lightning will still be 18 months away.

Besides if lightning does actually get finished there is no reason not to use that on bitcoin cash, or any other coin for that matter. Why pay $20+ for each channel open and close operation?
"
At which point BCH will implement LN aswell... Only it won't take $50 to open a Channel
"So the $20 fees I had to pay to move my BTC to BCH was just propaganda?

"
"I don't know about that, but I can buy coffee for 0.002 BCH (ca. 2€), while you can't (or would have to pay $10 fees for it).

Good luck waiting for your LN. Maybe someday you can actually use it. Dream on."
Lightning will always be 18 months away from being 18 months away hahaha good luck with that! In the mean time I will enjoy my actual functioning crypto in BCH. Huge profits for BCH coming in soon, not sure why you are so upset? You should get involved and diversify before its too late. 
"#What data do you base this on?

centralization, in banks is where a bank can stop your tx and steal your funds. The split this power up multiple companies need to agree on txs and funds, this means in bitcoin there being many miners makes bitcoin decentralized.

Full nodes do not in any capacity contribute to network security and don't contribute to decentralization


Also small blocks aren't economically viable, as we seen now with high fees"
Come on, you can do better than that. Is Blockstream not paying you enough?
"> So you prefer the medium that has the ability to do fewer things than the one that can do everything?

I didn't use a credit card to put the down payment on my house. I didn't use cash to buy my car. I don't use a check when leaving a tip at a restaurant or a coffee shop. So BCH is more useful for small transactions. Great! Use it for that! Put all your money in that if you'd like. Enjoy the ride."

It's not relevant to discuss the other ways of making payments because those other methods of payment are not Bitcoin. Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin. Just look at Gavin's tweet about it. Bitcoin Cash is the project he worked for years on before Blockstream took it over and turned it into not Bitcoin.
You're charged those fees even if you use a debit card. It's hidden in the price, it's not exposed as a fee. You pay it even if you pay cash. It's paid on their behalf and paid by you in return. Bottom line is you pay for it, no matter the accounting tricks. :)
"Bitcoin is Bitcoin.

Good then, we agree on the censorship.  The managers of Bitcoin are censoring discussion.  Why.  Obviously in order to promote an agenda.  1) We shouldn't have managers of Bitcoin.  2) whatever the agenda it's not market driven if censorship is required to drive it.
I never said BCore is a joke because of Tether.
I must admit I thought the same thing, but it does look like they are making decent progress. However, that is only half the problem as it will take years for business to build products around LN just it will years for Segwit to have a real effect. I do agree with everything else you have said.
"> The merchant doesn't need it either.

Merchant is just like you and me. 

I have bought stuff and settled debts with people I know using cryptocurrencies. So yes, we've got rid of banks in that. It's not everything, but it's a good start.

I agree that majority of people don't care about financial sovereignty, but I value it highly. I get you trust banks and that they'll serve you, but that's not always the case in my experience. Few years back I was in Greece and locals couldn't withdraw more than 50€ per day. With cryptocurrencies you don't need permission from anyone and can use your money freely.

This post is making the case for BCH by highlighting a use case in which BCH is better than BTC. Why is it not relevant to also discuss how BCH competes with other payment options? If the selling point for BCH is that it processes small transactions better, is it not actually more relevant to discuss a competing option that performs small transactions better?

I'm sorry, I thought this was a forum for bitcoin discussion, not blindly cheering on the narrative we like the best."

Sure, stores should set their prices so that they can pay all their services with their earnings. But that's on their behalf, not mine."
"As long as you're interacting with the blockchain meaning the transaction appears on the ledger, you'll have to pay fees. So when depositing your bitcoin into the exchange's wallet, you paid the miners a fee.

It's where all cryptocurrencies started, the original whitepaper."
"Only like 2000-3000 transactions can fit into a block. There are currently 43k transactions waiting to be included. Because of the backlog, only transactions with high fees are being included in blocks.

Bitcoin Cash solved this problem by simply raising the maxblocksize. Every pending transaction is included in every block. Since there's not a competition to get into the block, fees are what Bitcoin was meant to be, very, very low."
If you read my post and think I am supporting anything other than Bitcoin Cash as Bitcoin then you're just an idiot.
"> Luke, we don´t insult people here!

You must be new here. Roughly half of comments are insults."
I hope you find this as funny as I do. My last transfer (i was calling the transfer a trade) was with Bitcoin Cash, and so the pennies I paid were to the bitcoin cash network. So I am mistaken, I was trying to defend Bitcoin with the transfer I had made, which was actually a bitcoin cash transfer and not bitcoin.
"You said the pennies you paid were on an exchange for a TRADE. Can you please make up your mind?

"> You people

Haha, you're a real treat! First off, who wants to use BTC for micro-payments when it's still rising in value? That's what more traditional forms of currency are for. It still has plenty of uses, one being a rising store of value. My advice is to stop stressing out about it. Go hoard your BCH and use it to buy all the coffees you want. Will that make you happy?"
"So they are sabotaging thier main chain in order to drive traffic to an independent company specializing in custom block chains?

No, that is exactly good reasoning as anyone that bets into Bitcoin wants to eventually USE IT, and if its unusable, its not what its advertised as, meaning, its shit. You people can sugar coat it all you want, underneath its just shit.
Because high-fees and slow confirmation times is the business model of Blockstream, who controls the Bitcoin Core repository, r/bitcoin, and bitcointalk.org. Without high fees and slow confirmation times, their Liquid sidechain is pointless. It can't compete with on-chain transactions, so they need to artificially make Bitcoin unusable to sell their patented side-chain product.
"Yes your personal wallet->exchange's wallet requires a miner fee.

Trading on the exchange requires the exchange fee (which is the pennies you were talking about), but that is not what most people will be using bitcoin for. Bitcoin is meant for day to day transactions.

My entire point is, the selling point for BCH is ""we can buy coffee, BTC can't"", which is all fine and good. Once we've accepted that premise, the next question should be, ""why would someone use this over other options"", which is the question I'm asking. If I'm buying food at a restaurant, or coffee, or new shoes, what utility does BCH provide that existing payment methods don't?

Why is this important? Because continually pointing how how BCH excels over BTC, when the two are apparently targeting different use cases, is much less important than comparing the payment methods in competiton, in this case BCH and cash. If BTC is being used as digital gold, comparing it to gold (the thing it seeks to replace) makes sense. If BCH is being used to replace cash, comparing it to cash (again, what it is competing against) makes more sense than comparing it to BTC."

They will probably never solve the routing problem. A similar routing problem exists with internet traffic and that was only solved by using hundreds of thousands of dedicated routing machines that rely on custom hardware, complex routing protocols, and trust between routers. The lightning routing problem is even harder to solve.

"Who talked about 1 GB blocks? Adjusting the narrative by scaling the problem to 3 orders of magnitude is rather convenient, isn't it? Reality is that Bitcoin Cash, worst case scenario, would take 50 GB/year more than Bitcoin Legacy does now.

Look, there's a saying in software engineering world: there's no perfect solution, there are solutions that work now.

Reality is that blockchains are shared databases, databases get bigger with time. Any other solution is no longer p2p, is weak, can be regulated (see LN).

Regardless, not everybody's supposed to run a full node, Bitcoin was never designed so that everybody would run its own node.  I quote Satoshi here:

*The current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale.  That would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server.  The design supports letting users just be users.  The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be.  Those few nodes will be big server farms.  The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don't generate.*

Guess what, to scale to what Visa does you need a shitton of space.

It's like everybody pretends that scaling was never going to be a problem and is going towards extremely complicated mental gymnastics that only rape the real force of blockchain currencies."
"So it's like Lightning Network where large holders will route the small ones and get paid with routing fees? You realize that while technically different it ends in an even worse situation?

I think that a few % stake/year is a great solution.

At least everybody gets richer by the same % and everybody contributes to the network. Right now it's mostly the chinese, mining pool admins and miner producing companies getting richer by supporting the network.

So yes, I feel much better giving few % to everybody rather than a selected few.

I would support PoS Bitcoin. There are also other types of Proofs, like Via's proof of publication or delegate Proof of Stake (something like Ark minting is extremely democratic imo, especially if scaled to 10-20x minters and with less bonuses for the ""admins"")."

That's not how the burden of proof works. But just to humour you, what scientific evidence we have on the topic points against it. There was a thread yesterday on the front-page with links to the research if you're honestly interested.

"In fairness, it was equally as powerful and well reasoned as the claim to which it was responding.

But even if the claim that ""big blocks will lead to dangerous centralization"" *were* true (and frankly I've never found any of the arguments in support of that proposition to be very convincing), that wouldn't justify any particular block size limit. You'd still need to define what constitutes ""big"" blocks.  Obviously a binding limit can be too small.  For example, if tomorrow BTC soft forked the block size limit down to 1 kb, allowing perhaps one non-coinbase transaction per block, clearly that would not promote healthy ""decentralization""; quite the opposite, it would render the blockchain essentially unusable.  It's equally clear that if we tried to keep the 1-MB limit indefinitely while attempting to achieve truly global adoption, that would *eventually* have the same destructive effect.  (At 3 tx/sec it would take the world's 7 billion people a minimum of about 76 years (!) to each make a single on-chain transaction.) In other words: even if you're 100% convinced that we need (or will eventually need) *some* economically-binding ""consensus-rule""-type block size limit (because you're not convinced that a ""natural"" limit exists or will be sufficient), that doesn't tell us anything about *where* that limit should be set. It's *very* unlikely that 1 MB is the ""magic number"" that is getting the current tradeoffs just right (or is even within an order of magnitude of that number). Even if it were, it's essentially impossible that it would *stay* the right number as conditions change (e.g., as technology improves). 

Clinging to a crude, arbitrary, and always-intended-to-be-temporary limit long after it's become inadequate while Bitcoin's user experience continues to degrade, destroying essentially every use case other than pure speculation, that's not ""being conservative"" as some have tried to claim, that is recklessness.  "
Yeah, it's not on me to prove a negative. It's on you to prove the point.
Still true. There are zero studies linking bigger blocks to greater centralization.
You speak the truth. I would argue that greed will keep counties from banning. Once the big money investment firms are in, there is no going back. They already control the US government, destroying the crypto market would not be in their best interest.

"Would you be able to explain... I clearly don't understand you point, then.

I don't appreciate being down voted by the way. How about you make a comment to clear up my misinterpretations. "
"Just to entertain you, I personally run both a BTC and BCH full node with zero cost difference at this point.

To look at how costs (and what I think the argument is, centralization due to cost) _may_ diverge over the course of the next few years:

### Storage
If BCH had BTC's current traffic, blocks would largely average between 0.5MB and 2MB, but for the sake of argument, let's say each block is *full* at 4MB for the next 12 months. This would be an increase in the blockchain size (without additional compaction or pruning) of ~210GB. The current blockchain size is going on 200GB now. Now let's say the next year they go to *full* 6MB blocks all year, adding an additional ~315GB, and 8GB the year after, adding another 420GB.

This is to say, that with BCH becoming _way_ more popular than it currently is and requiring scaling _far beyond_ anything we anticipate. The blockchain size will be ~1.2TB 3 years from today.

On Amazon, currently, you can purchase a 2TB hard drive for $50-70. That price is expected to drop and/or storage for the same price will have increased by 3 years from today.

### Network Speed
To propagate new blocks, you'll need to be able to transfer them reasonably quickly (at least < 10 minutes, ideally quicker than 5). On an old-school 128kbps, a single 8MB block (not including any extraneous metadata or peer communications) can be transfered in just over 60 seconds. Now, honestly, nobody running a node _today_ should have that low of a connection, let alone 3 years from today at super-scaled 8MB capacity.

### Network Costs
This is an interesting one that comes up from time to time. Not many full nodes are likely running on metered connections (though my own VPS hosts are _limited_ connections). 

Block size itself isn't a particularly important factor here, as without side-chains being active (as they aren't today), sending 8000 1MB blocks uses the same, though technically slightly more, data than sending 1000 8MB blocks. People also enjoy mentioning the initial blockchain download duration as a factor here, but again, 1000 8MB blocks take up the same space and bandwidth as 8000 1MB blocks.

I fail to see where a simple block size increase, under any reasonable expectation (obviously we wouldn't jump to 1GB blocks this year), causes additional centralization. 

### Why does any of this matter for ""centralization""?
1) It's technically true that ""off-chain"" scaling could _limit_ the growth of the blockchain over time (which is potentially only important if we're hitting ~32MB before HDD/Network scaling has caught up), but we do not have evidence that this is remotely required due to technological advancements, nor are these off-chain options available today. We also don't have evidence that less nodes actually causes centralization issues, since mining is already largely centralized due to ASICs.

2) The fact is that _not everyone needs to run a node_. Many more well-off Bitcoin users, or enthusiasts as myself just wanting to support the network, will happily run them. It's also quite likely that companies invested in the space will also run full nodes to also support the overall network. Miners by nature will act as full nodes, and as the crypto space becomes more generally adopted, mining will become less and less centralized over time as well.


Also, peer comment from /u/redlightsaber is right. The burdgen of proof falls to the accuser.

"I don't think any delegation is good ideas. THAT lead to centralization for sure. Having 10 terabytes of data increase the cost to be your full node but that very easy to get, having huge routing or delegate is problematic, those can be corrupted to block transactions or reveal your own transactions. No thanks I prefer to stick with plan transactions and normal mining... over times it's been demonstrated that mining get more and more distribution and we can have gigabyte blocks with no protocol upgrade... just better code.
"
No, that isn't right, you filthy liar.
"> The blockchain size will be ~1.2TB 3 years from today.

So? The size of the blockchain has never been a problem and anyone using that to justify a computer science reason for anything is wrong. Regardless, this is a $300 fix, today. In 3 years It will probably be a $75 fix.

The Bitcoin problem is UTXO processing. If you don't understand what that is, you shouldn't be making the argument you are making.

> 1000 8MB blocks take up the same space and bandwidth as 8000 1MB blocks.

And this is exactly why the people making the argument you are making are consistently wrong and do not understand. Disk space does not matter. The types of transaction, the number of sig hashes, matter. My 1MB block may take a lot longer to verify than your 1MB block. But /r/Bitcoin does not understand this.

> I fail to see where a simple block size increase ... causes additional centralization.

Correct.

> It's technically true that ""off-chain"" scaling

Off-chain scaling is euphemism for Banking.

> The fact is that not everyone needs to run a node

And then we dump it. No one sane wants bcash. Everyone wants Bitcoin.
"*facepalm* 

They meant using bitcoin on the network. Sending money to another address. Not on exchanges. Trades on exchanges happen off chain. You deposit your bitcoin in their address, and they let you play with it and trade with people for a fee. Bitcoin itself doesn't move on the blockchain when you make trades, it stays in the exchange's address. This fee is taken by the exchange not the network.

Try sending your bitcoin to another person or to another address and watch it melt away to fees."
And don’t use BCH for microtransactions either. Other coins are better suited for that. BCH for $2-100 purchases, competing with two dozen similar coins trying to cover the same space. Good luck. You need it. 
"> Its a disgrace, that's what it is.

Some folks just bought a bunch at 5500 and it's up to 8k. Such an incredible disgrace! Anything that's not a currency is a disgrace! Gold and silver is a disgrace! The equity in my house is a disgrace! "
Wow, that was uncalled for. It's not my fault your sarcasm detector is broken. Perhaps it's what's going on in your head you should be worried about.
Yes, absolutely it does. Just ask Venezuelans.
Cool. Stop visiting bitcoin subreddits then.
For example right now you can get into the next block with a 35 sat fee, which is for a standard transaction less than a dollar. Don’t believe the fud. 
But you are paying a $20+ fee with a credit card, and you get like $10 back. If you don’t use a cc you don’t get anything back and still pay the fee as its built in to the price. 
"No. Poor people will use IOTA and byteball. Their fees are free or well below 1 cent. Byteball is a BTC airdrop too, and it confirms in 30 seconds. 

BCH has no chance competing in the micro transaction arena. Hard truth. "
"I didn't downvote you.

Bitcoin Cash is already capable of the capacity needed for cheap transactions. You can use Bitcoin Cash to buy coffee for a fee of something like $0.05, or even free. That's my point. The ""technology"" is not the problem. The artificial maxblocksize is the problem."
"The tech isn't there yet. U can still make large purchases for relatively cheap. What's the big deal?


*is your order 250 or more? Pay in bitcoin to recieve 10 percent off*"

Maybe you should do 5 minutes of digging into BTC and realize they both have downsides.
What makes you think Bitcoin Cash is run by anyone? Any more than Bitcoin is run by someone?
It just got less funny in here.
\*ducks for cover\*
Because on-chain scaling leads to greater centralisation, which weakens Bitcoin's censorship resistance.
"Few.

The question then becomes who can afford to pay $5-$10 to send $1000, $2000, $10000? The answer then becomes a lot of BTC holders.


BTC isn't suited for buying coffee. Quite frankly I don't think BCH is very well suited for buying a coffee either. "
How many redditors take everything literally?
Say I bought 1 single bch at 300$, and sold it at it's peak, around 2k$. Yea 1.7k$ is still not enough for a lambo
But why sell now? If it's heading to 3~4k anyways. Price parity with BTC, then we'll overtake its place!
Not unless they put in a huge amount. Most people they can only dream of it. 
*
for one it makes a centralized system with very few users who are easy to attack
As Segwit death spirals, only the rich will be able to pay the exorbitant fees to move their coins to exchanges.
"When the poor can't move their money, their accounts are basically frozen. There are many addresses right now that don't contain enough to pay for the fees to move THEMSELVES. Essentially only the rich can use it. If you don't have more than $10k worth of btc to move, you're screwed.

I can't buy $50 worth of btc because basically half of it will be gone by the time its in my address. And another half when I try to spend it."
"What's wrong with Bitcoin finding a different place in the market where altcoins can far better bank the unbanked? We don't need Bitcoin to do everything, it does some things well it does other things horribly.


Also with Lightning Network it can easily make Bitcoin once again accessible to the underbanked. Mind you once this gains enough transactions Bitcoin will need to indeed make some capacity upgrades to maintain this use case scenario. "
I won't particiapte where dicsussion is censored. what's you link say?
"Nobody runs BCH... just as nobody runs BTC.

Now if you are implying that very very rich people are supporting BCH... why bet against that?"
I didn't mean that the ads should actually mention Macs and PCs. I just used those ads as an example of ads that happened to be unusually funny. Having two actual people playing the role of two competing currencies could be similarly funny if the script is well written.
"They're not **awful**, they're just exceptionally over-priced with costly add-ons and aimed at more simple minded people.

Like BTC."

"I'm seeing that...
Very sad state of affairs and pretty childish imo.. It does seem very religious in a way, and makes me want to go atheist.
If anything, this so called 'war' will be what brings down Bitcoin, and all its forked offshoots.. People will end up (and I hope I am wrong) abandoning Bitcoin and moving into other cryptocurrencies, I know I kind of feel like that after a spending a couple of hours each day on r/btc and r/bitcoin.. Sad!"
"This week,I saw the Muppets complaining that Jim Henson had put his hand inside of them inappropriately and manipulated them. 
Maybe the same can be said of Roger Ver..."
Coinbase is adding 100K new users per day. They don't deal with tethers.
he will sooner or later.
Then its not a cryptocurrency but cryptocommodity
"Rubbish. Bitcoin hard forked many times before, Bitcoin Cash forked twice, other coins forked also, there is nothing dangerous about it. Also, consensus was all there, only the Core **developers** who don't even run the network (**miners do**) are against it, and all the ""reasoning"" they provided is proven wrong."
You don’t understand that the real bitcoin will eventually be able to do what bcash does. Any altcoin can do what bcash can do
I curious if he is the same guy who draws the original images years ago... or just photoshop a new one from the original artwork...
I thought this was about buying coffee? I fully understand the benefits cryptos provide, I just don't see how making the coffee argument highlights those benefits, unless you expect the government or bank to start infringing on your right to purchase warm caffinated drinks. Again, it's about choosing the best tool for the job, and when it comes to coffee, both BTC and BCH are inferior tools.
"1 BCH = 1 cup of coffee
1 BTC = 1 Lambo "
"Currency Economics 101

1) Collectible 
2) Store of Value
3) Medium of Exchange 
4) Unit of Account 

We can not just start at number 3 because of impatience."
Because there seems to be a need for a coffee coin, and it would make payments way easier :)
Must be a very large cup!
I'd say they both won.. one just more than the other
If you don't mind the fees, sure. But not everyone can afford them. The fees alone in Bitcoin cost more than the daily salary of some countries.
it makes a new storage space for each user, and allows the users to specifiy a location to withdraw too by talking to the bot in private messages.
Good bot!
Oh, okay, I thought r/bch was the BCH subreddit, since BTC is Bitcoin, and BCH is Bitcoin Cash.
">This is the Bitcoin subreddit for people that hate Bitcoin Core

FTFY. Post-Gavin Core is the worst thing that has ever happened to Bitcoin. Luckily, we have Bitcoin Cash."
So I've subscribed to the wrong subreddit then, sorry! 😜
Agreed, but the hate and lack of unity is getting old very quickly..

Well the Tether thing is just a made conspiracy without basis in fact. But let's for the sake of discussion say you're right and Tether is propping up BTC. What makes you think then it's not propping up BCH and other altcoins? In fact it'd be far easier for them to prop up smaller market cap coins like BCH such a manner than to do so for BTC. 
No, go ahead! I just searched on Reddit, nowhere to be found.
Linux won :P

No. Bitcoin Cash disabled RBF, making zero-conf a great solution for smaller  transactions.

Found the person who gets the OSI model.
And you can buy an ipad with btc. No problem. 
You don't understand Bitcoin.
You can buy stuff above $100 too. That's the magic of affordable electronic peer to peer cash.
Uh huh.
Mind the message, not the messenger.
Yeah it is...  hell its pushing 8k...   literally worthless these days
Yeah. Bitcoin Core should adopt a new one, since what they've created is no longer Bitcoin.
Are you sure? I spent $30 last weekend moving all my BTC from a segwit address. And my mom spent $10 since hers had fewer outputs. How can you tolerate that? I moved all my BTC to segwit when it came out because I believed in it. But the more I read up about it, the more I realised it was just convoluted bandaid solution, filled with technical debt and bloat.
But I want coffee
It's dangerous to throw off your chains without 12 months of planning and overwhelming community consensus.

Wow thank you! I think this guy/girl drew them. Hope they draw some more. https://twitter.com/bitcoincashlime
Maybe 1mBCH will equal a cup of coffee.
When your credit card declines your transaction when you're trying to buy a cloud mining contract, or mining equipment, or a ghost gunner from Defense Distributed, then you'll understand.
Now try buying something that is less than $10 in price.
why do you think that?

No, I found it here: https://twitter.com/bitcoincashlime
Ethereum is not intended to be a currency. Bitcoin is.
Buy coin with your entire paycheck. Use that coin until your next paycheck. Save anything left over into cold storage, repeat upon your next paycheck. It's not a revolutionary idea to use a currency as a currency. Bitcoin Cash being that currency, since BTC is no longer a currency.

"Don't forget Bitfinex stole 15% of everyone's BCH who had deposited there during the fork without forewarning (they had promised to credit all) and used their own incompetence as an excuse.

I don't get how people are fine with that."
Dozen others must be Blockstream
And for good reason. Otherwise it would be this shit.
I always thought that was the least realistic thing about that show. Like all of a sudden human beings had no bills to pay, families were somehow all supported financially,  nobody was selfish and wanted or needed money (speaking about the Federation really, since the Ferengi are the opposite). But despite the lack of need for money, they still found themselves in a damn battle or war every episode. I guess perfect utopias don't really exist.
so it is a slave ship?
"This is just not true, Bitfinex only trades USDT as they have no access to banking whatsoever. They misleadingly showing BTCUSD as the pair, but in fact it is BTCUSDT.
Misstating their pair as USD is already a huge red flag."
"> Bitfinex trades USD and allows users to withdraw in either fiat or USDT. Bitfinex redeems USDT for USD on a 1:1 basis which is all that backs it.

WRONG."
Nail on the head.
"Sure they have the ability to runs fractional reserve hopefully they aren't  but we don't really know. If they do such a thing so I guess it's not too different from how their bank does the same thing.

Anyhow it's not like they just create USD out of thin air. They issue tokens out of thin air and then those tokens are given the value of USD because they redeem them on par. If they ever failed to do so the value of USDT around drop. That USDT is being valued by the market ts the same value of USD (Kraken for example trades USDT/USD free floating) indicates that they continue to live up to their obligations to redeem it on par at request. "
"The hack occurred, or was at least made public, in August 2016, no? Where are you getting 7 months ago?

"They do, but at the same time there's been a huge bull run and little to show that anyone's actually cashing USDT out to cash.

If people are only buying it to hedge back into fiat short term, there's not exactly going to be much demand to convert it back. That could easily change."
I dont have to prove, we are discussing possible fraud. If you don't believe it, it's okay. Just read the information and come to your own conclusion, but explore all possibilities and dont be in denial
They should have followed what real exchanges do, it is not exactly rocket science - of course then one does not get to take 15% and even get away with it. :)
"Psychologically, people who have connected their sense of self-worth to any given phenomenon cannot be convinced they're right. And the BTC zealots are connecting being BTC holders so tightly with their own feeling of self-worth, they will ride BTC right down into a burning crater and total financial annihiliation, and when it's done they'll sit there in the burning rubble and say ""BTC is still the best, and BCH is a shitcoin"". 

No amount of information pointing out they're wrong, no amount of facts and reasoned argument will be able to convince someone that invested in something that the facts don't support their position. 

The people who maybe can be convinced are the ones who don't yet have a strong opinion either way. 

Of course, the same can be said for some BCH zealots. Personally I'm on the BCH train because I believe it's the better Bitcoin, and I think I have real data and facts that support that, not just the circular ""BTC is the greatest because it's BTC, therefore BTC is the greatest"" that you see so often from BTC supporters."
It's true. I can verify this.

That's a dangerous way of looking at it though. *Everything* stays afloat, until it doesn't. Exchanges should really have independent audits that prove solvency."
There's an active investigation on your brother in-law too. Sounds like he's in a lot of trouble.

Any minute now! 
I think he means it's pretty apparent that the bubble formed quite some time ago.
 The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. 
There's also never been any proof that don't have anything to back Tether, and thus far there they've proven to have at least enough to keep it a float as it stands.
Give me proof its fake. You got none.
"I think the reasoning is fair enough. Lenders are locked into contracts at the short's leisure for an unknown amount of time, which can be up to 30 days. BCH only came up a week or so before the fork. One can draw parallels with stock splits and the like, but from a more practical perspective this causes the least disruption on the exchange. One could just margin long a BTC/alt pair at every fork like on Poloniex for ""free money"" and the lending book would dry up.  

As far as I know shorts and alt/BTC longs will from now on be allocated short positions on the ""other side"" of the fork as well, which was to be the case with 2x for example. The BTG fork was handled in this way and it worked just fine without anyone bitching or liquidity issues appearing."
Actually I think that's when the most dedicated ones double-down.
"You quoted the definition of a Tether. What's that supposed to prove?

> Bitfinex treats USDT as USD, all of the ""USD"" pairs on Finex are in fact USDT.

This non sequitur is identical in form to the one you stated previously. The conclusion doesn't follow from the premise.

> How exactly do you think a market which has had no access to banking since April would have an active USD market?

Do you have no idea how *exchanges* work? What do you think happened to the USD that Bitfinex had prior to its banking issues?

> all of the ""USD"" pairs

Pairs? It's clear you *don't* understand how exchanges work. We're not discussing trading pairs here.

Here's another problem with your logic: the implication of what you're saying is that Bitfinex has 100% of its customers' USD holdings in the form of USDT. Why do you think that, as opposed to say, that Bitfinex is operating a fractional reserve? 

Since Bitfinex hasn't announced either scenario, why are you assuming one instead of the other? You claimed that ""the most token amount of research"" would settle this, yet you can't provide a relevant reference.

You probably shouldn't get all your information by reading reddit.

Highest volume because they offer margin trading and no KYC to do so.
"Nothing of what you said disprove the possibility of USDT being used to manipulate the market on a large scale, it doesn't prove that Tether is backed by a USD reserve (or equivalent currency) either.

Personally it creeps me out how people like you are eager to dismiss anything that makes them uncomfortable as a ""conspiracy"" or ""FUD"", it's like a game of musical chair, everyone is happy as long as the money flows and if you ask legitimate questions then you are a ""goofy conspiracy theorist"", massive financial manipulations has never been a thing listening to you."
Well, I don't want to speculate on tethers, but the last economic crisis rocked the global economy in a (by crypto standards) highly regulated market place. Crypto is the wild west by comparison and I don't find it at all hard to believe that Bitfinex (and others) are up to no good. How much did Karplese walk away with?
"> For starters if Bitfinex wanted to create fake USD out of thin air to buy up BTC then why would they do it fully transparently on the blockchain? They could more easily do it internally off chain in their own ledger within the exchange and keep this activity private, just the same as any exchange be it Bitstamp or Gemini, or Kraken could just as easily do there's no need for Tether to be capable of doing this.

If they just created dodgy balances people would have no way to withdraw it and any scam would be super-limited as withdrawals would quickly start failing (as in MtGox).

On top of this Bitfinex has no banking access so without tethers users can't make withdrawals anyway."
"I don't care if thether is fake or not.

But saying that tether is baked by other cryptos is more than an enormous risk.

I mean. At the end that's what we want.
Kill fiat and replace by cryptos.

But we are  not there yet. "
"Comparing those market caps doesn't mean anything.

If someone deposits 1 million to bitfinex, tether market cap goes up by 1 million.  That person then buys a Bitcoin for 1 million, the value of that account goes to 1 trillion."
"> suggests that they've done their homework and feel that USDT really is backed by sufficient funds

This is the exact same reasoning that led the subprime morgage crisis to become a worldwide recession spanning just shy of a decade, instead of just a localised group of few american banks going under.

You realise this, right?"
Yes, but they still trade in USD.
"As for Kraken they couldn't care less. They don't treat 1 USDT as 1 USD. USDT is traded against USD free floating on Kraken. 

Meanwhile Polo and Bittrex use it as an IOU representing USD and Bitfinex redeeming this for USD on a 1:1 basis is all that's backing it. So Polo, Bittrex, OKCoin they have big counter party risk as they depend on Bitfinex to redeem USDT. 

However Kraken if Bitfinex went under wouldn't be a problem as they don't trade against USDT or treat it as USD and then every one on Kraken who shorted USDT would of make money. Kraken is basically what can be used as a metric to determine the true value of USDT. If it stays on par with USD then that indicates that there is indeed a 1:1 backing of USD, otherwise USD/USDT on Kraken would plummet. "

"""Breaking the law"" and ""being fraudulent"" are two very different things. "
"Because I dont think the SEC will recognize USDT as USD, and rightly so, because its not.

But does that mean USDT is a fraud?"
Well, when does the pumping stop, that's the question? If it's a year from now and BTC finally have a solution to the clogged network then I think the opposite will be true. 
"Right. Bitcoincash already has the upper hand because utility is the most reliable way to achieve real and sustainable demand. 

It's just that this kind of Monkey business like tethers doesn't really sp ed progress up. Quite the contrary.  But hey, I blame those using it. Bitfinex is just profiting big time out of people's stupidity. "

Well, you can spend usdt on anything so if they're propping up bitcoin they are probably propping up everything. But of course, nothing has bitcoin's liquidity, so there's not too many (any?) order books  of other coins that you can play around in with that extreme amounts of usdt.
"Sure they could be running a fractional reserve which is why you should never be holding USDT due to the counter party risk. That is a legitimate concern.


But this whole everytime they issue more tether they're making money out of thin air and buying Bitcoin with it so price is going up because of new Tether issuance makes no sense. "

"the thing is, nobody can backup tethers claim or show evidence, that it isn't fraudulent. there has been almost a billion in Tethers generated in very short time period.

that is at least worrisome."
Dude you’re in r/btc.....these fuckers probably believe the earth is flat too.
They mark it as USD, but it's USDT, no?
That’s not a standard disclaimer on accounting reports. Accounting is supposed to be usable by the public. It was not a real audit either after reading the report. They only gave screen shots!
">Why?

Because everything I said was true. You'd be angry too if someone forced their shitty way of life on you at rape/gunpoint for generations, stole your land, rewrote your history to place themselves at the center as the best, etc. Most normal people would be actually, your reaction is the oddball.

>You should probably educate yourself before you spout off though. 

Son, I will tell you that I have forgotten ten times as much information as you have ever learned in your life. 

>tart with the different forms of money that existed long before Europeans were even a thing.

Irrelevant. You are going to make this point from a historical analysis. The problem is the people I mentioned before CHANGED, DESTROYED, AND REWROTE previous histories of 'pagans' wherever they went, since more than 1000 years ago starting with the catholic church. Don't try to give me a history lesson, or you might find yourself SEVERELY reeducated by actual knowledge.

> Isn't that interesting to you? 

No, what a stupid question. I've never seen a society that has a slave system run off of cacao seeds. Priorities.

There are groups of people whose entire counting system consists of 1, 2 and many. They do not use money and they live awesome lives. Yet you will try to tell me they don't exist because money has existed in some form for a long time? Logic sir, use it. "

"Well typically burden of proof is they other way around. I personally am quiet sceptical of tether and do not use it though.

I guess in this case though the need to demonstrate it's not fake if they want people to use it."
It's actually over $600 million now.

Funny because i thought one of your devs was a confirmed flat earther?
"No, that doesn't make sense.

For example, the daily trade volume on Bitfinex in BTC/USD is greater than the total amount of USDT. While in theory that's possible, in practice it's extremely unlikely.

No matter what's going on with Bitfinex and Tether, it's not the case that all their BTC/USD trades are actually BTC/USDT.
"
But if you're using common proxy IPs your vote is probably being discounted by reddit.
But do you have evidence that it isn't fraudulent? They can't find a US bank willing to work with them with USD yet they have issued $500 million in Tether?
"> Well typically burden of proof is they other way around. 

I have grown to despise this argument. In every debate, ***both*** parties are making a claim. Just because one is claiming something is true, and the other one is claiming it’s false, doesn’t mean only one of them has the burden of proof. 

They both do. Period."
"No, that's actually exactly the case. Bitfinex has no banking access, it's impossible to deposit or withdraw USD. All of the ""USD"" in their system is actually tethers."
"No, that's actually exactly the case. Bitfinex has no banking access, it's impossible to deposit or withdraw USD. All of the ""USD"" in their system is actually tethers. There's an enormous amount of day traders, bots and wash trading on the platform which is what brings the volume up."
You are very uninformed.
"I get that it's just that proving a negative is typically not possible. There's actually a name for it which I unfortunately forget at the moment.

In this case though I do think bitfinex needs to prove tether is not a scam. I mean I certainly wouldn't use it without proof.

Edit: ah here is what I was trying to remember. [Russell's teapot](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_teapot) essentially demonstrates how the inability to disprove something does not prove it. i.e. him not having proof that tether isn't fraudulent doesn't prove that it is. We ultimately need proof it is fraudulent."
"> Bitfinex has no banking access, it's impossible to deposit or withdraw USD. All of the ""USD"" in their system is actually tethers.

That conclusion doesn't follow from the premise.

Perhaps you're confused because USDT is a way to get USD out of Bitfinex. That doesn't mean that all their (nominal) USD holdings are actually USDT, though.
"
"It is not a negative. Their claim is:

Each and every single existing Tether is backed by $1.

They have to prove their claim. But they have not proven their claim.
"
"Well shit. Half the time, proving a positive isn’t possible either. It really just depends what information is available in the way of proof. But I think both parties are equally carrying the burden. The only way, if you really think about it, that one party wouldn’t carry that burden, is if there’s some universal rule where everyone knows something to be true. And when is that even a thing?

I get into arguments like this with people in the medical system because they always call bullshit on everything. If you have a set of symptoms and you think you know what it is, they demand published studies. It’s like well listen fucker. A study hasn’t been done on it. So if you’re going to tell me I’m full of shit, prove to me why. But they always say the burden of proof is on me. 

It’s just not. I don’t accept it. I think it’s maybe one of those social things where people just say it “wrong” all the time. And that’s just the “accepted” way of thinking. But it’s completely wrong.

Think about it this way: (and why this is so stupid). If you think about it, it’s really just the first person who speaks that USUALLY carries the burden of proof in a social situation. 

If one person says “I’m just letting everyone here know that this is not true”, then everyone else has the right to say “prove it”.

But if somebody stands up and says “I’m letting everyone know that this is the case!”

Then everyone in the audience can say “prove it”. I honestly think this is just one of those social things where people just don’t even think about it. The first person to speak ends up being the one who’s got the burden of proof, according to everyone else."
Bitfinex has no USD trading pairs. It's all USDT. Even the most token amount of research on your part would have shown that.
"Yea and I agreed to that point. The part I'm referring to is when he asked ""do you have any proof they aren't fraudulent"" 

wouldn't matter if he didn't have proof they aren't fraudulent as that would not prove/disprove they are."
"What if I told you there is a teapot orbiting the sun between Earth and Mars?

Burden of proof lies with the person making unfalsifiable claims."
In that case, it should be easy for you to back that up.
"How about via [Bitfinex's own site](https://support.bitfinex.com/hc/en-us/articles/213919369-What-are-Tethers-)?

> Each tether is backed 1-to-1 by traditional currency held in Tether Limited’s reserves. Accordingly, 1 USD₮ is always equivalent to 1 USD. Bitfinex lets you receive USD₮ from a Bitcoin blockchain address and treat them as a USD deposit. Similarly, you can withdraw funds to a Bitcoin blockchain address as USD₮. 

Bitfinex treats USDT as USD, all of the ""USD"" pairs on Finex are in fact USDT.

How exactly do you think a market which has had no access to banking since April would have an active USD market?"
"Therefore Tethers shouldn't make up USDTs and expect traders to disprove that USDTs are backed.

Instead, Tethers, who made up the USDTs, should prove how they are made."
Burden of proof is on Bitfinex. They literally refuse to address the concerns. Even the CME group isnt going to include them in the Bitcoin price index. That should tell you that it isnt only bloggers that are sketched out by Bitfinex.
"I'm well aware.

Was meaning to ask by the by, what are your thoughts on [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7ddy48/tether_just_printed_another_20_million_usdt_out/dpxmzs6/)?"

"**Bitfinex hack**

The second-biggest breach of a Bitcoin exchange platform, Bitfinex, caused 120,000 units of the cryptocurrency bitcoin, which was valued at $72 million at the time, to be stolen. Bitfinex first announced the security breach on August 2, 2016. The bitcoin was taken from users' segregated wallets and Bitfinex has been tracking down the hack. Significant hacker funds transactions were signed off by Bitfinex's security provider, without full security.

"30 million tethers released just today, that's ~4% of bitfinex's daily BTC volume ~.55% of total daily BTC volume. Lets just estimate that the addition of .55% additional buying pressure increased the price by .55% since supply is constant. .55% of $7800 is ~$43 per bitcoin price inflation, The market cap of bitcoin is based on price per bitcoin * 16,684,612 BTC = $715 million dollars in increased market cap  
**$30 million USDT = $715 million market cap**  
Holy shit. Now, Imagine if those tethers were used for margin trading 10:1 or 100:1. Now remember that this isn't the first time this has happened.  
If Tether is a scam it will absolutely devastate the market.

"But the pumps would most likely be significant percentage of ""wash trades"" just like Willy Bot during mtgox. Not sure what percentage would be wash trades though. Anyhow I'm, and I'm sure all of us, would like to know the best defense if this comes true. One thing for sure is to not hold tethers. But to stay out of BTC for an unknown period time doesn't seem like a good option either unfortunately."

"So lets assume this is the right way to calculate (im not an economist) 600 mil tether would be 900 dollars of the current btc price, or 450, since its affecting the whole crypto market.

"sure, the 'real' tether could have been used to make it seem like there 20 million dollar more demand for coin coins when there wasn't and once those were acquired they could have been changed into woprking bitcoin cash. 

Everything is possible. no crypto is immune from an exchange doing what bnx is doing "

"They did warn that they'd adjust BCH balances to account for ""manipulation"", but they basically bullshitted and took a cut from everyone even if you clearly didn't do anything to manipulate the balance."
">stole 15% of everyone's BCH 

- I have 1 BTC on Finex. I lend it out. I expect to receive 1 BCH after the fork.

- Mr. Bear borrows the BTC and places a short.

- You buy that BTC and expect 1 BCH to go with it.


We have 1 BTC that changed hands and Finex is expected to conjure up 2 BCH from it. 

Clearly the ratio system was wonky, but in their defense they at least announced it in advance.
The more controversial part of the event was when people who had x BTC in the margin wallet, and had an x BTC short going, thereby lowering the ratio by the way, didn't receive x BCH. "
"Wasn't this a result of people shorting BTC during the fork? Everyone shorting doesn't actually have the BTC that produced a BCH at the fork (they're holding cash), so they end up owing the individual they borrowed the BTC his BTC.


This can be played out 1 of 2 ways:


1. Everyone who was shorting BTC must immediately buy an equivalent amount of BCH at market price, resulting in a sudden BCH pump.


2. The 'missing' BCH is socialized across everyone holding BTC on the exchange at the time of the fork.


Rather than prop up the price of BCH and pissing off the shorters, option 2 was exercised."
"Any one who stored their BTC on an exchange during the fork is lucky to have got anything... 

Bitfinex never promised to credit all the BCH, and they did forewarn users about their strategy.

This.
It’s a tweet of someone demanding a company do something and not getting a response. There is better proof of tether being fraudulent than this. 
Hundreds of core troll flooding this forum lately
They are downvoting only because it effects their wallet. I hodl btc but the evidence is just too strong against tether uses on certain exchanges. There will be repercussions if this is true. Hedge just in case.
[deleted]
Because it's a tweet about a conspiracy theory?
"People are dellusional to think all these pumps could go on forever and make them rich. Cryptospace has been in a bubble now and it has to correct.

Printing up fradulent theters to pump crypto is equally as fradulent as the fed printing up money to buy the stock market up. It'll go up seemingly forever, enriching the few insiders who know how long should they hold, then eventually crash on the last fomo guys like the game of chicken.

Everyone in the cryptospace knows this but they refuse to see reality. ""This time is different"", ""we're not even close to the market cap of the stock bubble"", ""we're not even close to the market cap of gold"". 

Be wise and tread carefully. Crypto can make you rich, but remember to follow rule number one : Don't invest money you cannot afford to lose. "
"This seems to be a rather persistent campaign by one guy (""bitfinexed"") against Bitfinex, repeating the same allegation again and again and again.

I'm also wondering whether Bitfinex' tethers turning out to be worthless would affect the value of other cryptos catastrophically. A lot of money would evaporate, it would probably reduce demand, but I don't see a reason why this would be truly catastrophic for anyone not dealing in Tethers.

The companies who let customers trade with Tethers wouldn't be affected, their customers would simply be holding worthless coins.

Tether could be a fraud, but there's plenty of money to be made running it legitimately."
Because these are false allegations with no evidence to back up any fraud claims. 
because this guy is a troll that has some position hes trying to back. he has some kind of agenda and bases his entire argument around some legal language that protects finex under extenuating circumstances.  there are for a fact massive customers putting real cash in through tether.  bitcoin is in fact becoming a thing big money wants to buy.  I would guess this guy shorted at one point and lost everything and now has an agenda he is clearly bizarrely obsessed with.  
"When the burst come all crypto will go down. BTC might half but also BCH will drop back significantly. Other exchanges are not safe either, lots of them only operate on thether, they have no USD flowing in and out directly. So the market linked to tether is about 50% and not just the 17% of Bitfinex. And since on most exchanges washing is allowed (trading against yourself) the volume numbers don't really mean anything.

So all be careful and get your funds out of the exchanges on time. If there is ever a panic and at the same time a clogged up mempool BTC is totally screwed. "
"I dislike what core has done to Bitcoin, hence became a Bitcoin cash enthusiast. But let's be clear.. theters will evaporate to zero value and all cryptos will be affected. If anything, Bitcoin is in a better position than all other coins because they have a larger market and still a strong brand.

No. These are the Wild West days for the crypto world, much like the Interent in the 90's, cowboys only.
I hope this shit isn't one of the unsaid truths of the future of crypto. Can you imagine an episode of Star Trek made with this kind of stuff in mind? They wouldn't even be able to pilot the ship every episode would be the same thing.
Is there anything that wasn't predictably obvious?
The timing of the tether printing has been time-coincident with btc price surges time and time again.
It's best trading platform I've come across and it's margin trading plus high volume great features and liquidity.  This thread is just FUD. There's nothing wrong with  Bitfinex, some people just hold a grunge because they sold their BFX tokens for a loss while others bought $1 from them for $0.30.
"Tether is just a place holder coin for a dollar. These sites say ""tethers equal a dollar"" and then issue them out to people. But is there any actual dollars backing those coins up?....."
"[Here you go](https://tether.to/). They are claiming to offer 1 USD₮ for USD. It is currently traded on fiat to crypto exchanges like Bitfinex and Kraken or crypto to crypto exchanges like Poloniex and Shapeshift.

However, I would be wary of Tether based on the information provided in the comments above, but you are welcome to make your own conclusions based on the evidence given."
"Bitfinex has a sister company called Tether. They issue tokens over the Bitcoin blockchain called Tether Dollars (USDT). 

These are tokens that Bitfinex redeems on par for USD, they're IOUs for USD. The reasoning behind using it is that USD is hard to send but sending USDT is just as easy to send as sending Bitcoin around the world. This makes it very easy to move around funds representative of USD over the blockchain. This is why you'll see Bitfinex, Poloniex, and Bittrex all have prices very closely in line with one and other. This is because it's very easy to pull off arbitrage between those exchanges as they all accept USD.

Anyhow a bunch of conspiracy theorist spread FUD speculating that Bitfinex doesn't have the USD to back USDT and/or that they are issuing USDT out of thin air without any corresponding USD to back it and are then using this to buy up crypto and that that's why we're in a  bubble. Anyhow that's all FUD there is no proof, it's no more than a conspiracy. There obviously is counter party risk when using USDT though that you must be aware of and that is that USDT only have the value of USD so long as Bitfinex continues to redeem it for USD."
Total bullshit, You are no one to tell bittrex how to move millions!!! What did you expect? The fact that they ignored you is just soooo normal o.o
Depends on if the tether issuers have been shopping for alts. Make fake money, buy btc, buy alts, pump btc, buy alts, pump btc, crash bch, buy bch, obliterate btc and have fat stacks of the good alts.

"Someone commented earlier saying this is similar to
Subprime lending. This is my educated guess. Tether is getting “lent” money to create USDT that people who already have millions of dollars are buying into so they can quickly trade on these exchanges and pump the value of bitcoin. While it is getting mixed with actual peoples money and the bitcoin holders are happy because they think they are going to become rich. Two scenarios I see in all of this. While the smart investors or criminal masterminds who bought early and reaping the benefits by getting out and liquidating their coins into cold hard cash or into their checkings whatever come out as winners but eventually they too will become losers. Everyone buying bitcoin with their cash are banking that the value in bitcoin they will be able to buy things trading bitcoin for services or goods. Sooner or later actually USD is going to be inflated and prices of things are going to skyrocket. If this starts to happen because money is literally being printed out of thin air aka cyberspace. Economic collapse in the making 2020!!!"
So if bitfinex is about to mtgox, shouldn't someone like... get 60minutes on it or something? I mean that would be big, mainstream news. It would be great to have an exposé on that. Even if it turns out to be false, the bitfinex scandal seems worth investigating...

As far as a bubble, bitcoin is speculative so long as it has little use, but I also keep saying that there are deep pockets buying bitcoin.  So don't be disheartened when it does not pop.  We should be ignoring the price and focusing on making bitcoin (BCH and BTC) fun again.  Efforts by BCH and rbtc are going to make BlockStream fix their transaction problem and address their censorship.

">  they are the highest volume USD exchange

didnt they close down for US customers?"
"I do feel that the fact that multiple other exchanges are willing to hold huge amounts of USDT that expose them to quite a bit of liability if Bitfinex is fraudulent suggests that they've done their homework and feel that USDT really is backed by sufficient funds.  Otherwise if Tethers go bust it would severely harm a lot of these exchanges since they hold a huge amount of tethers themselves.

The real risk is if some government finds and locks down the bank accounts that Bitfinex is using to back these Tethers, which I find more likely than Bitfinex just having invented Tethers out of thin air."
"Should be noted that Bittrex and Poloniex only use USDT and have no USD. This introduced large counter party risk on their behalf. As for Karken however they do deal in USD and trade USDT as free floating so no counter party risk there.

Anyhow yes it's a goofy conspiracy. 

For starters if Bitfinex wanted to create fake USD out of thin air to buy up BTC then why would they do it fully transparently on the blockchain? They could more easily do it internally off chain in their own ledger within the exchange and keep this activity private,  just the same as any exchange be it Bitstamp or Gemini, or Kraken could just as easily do there's no need for Tether to be capable of doing this. Them using Tether gives us more insight into their actives if anything. If they're going to commit fraud why would they do it out in open?

Secondly [Tether has a market cap of $615,847,906](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/) meanwhile we can verify that [Bitfinex's cold storage currently hold $1.3 billion worth of BTC](https://blockchain.info/address/3D2oetdNuZUqQHPJmcMDDHYoqkyNVsFk9r). Then we need to take into account that they also have a hot wallet and hot wallets and cold storage for many altcoins. So they certainly have at least a couple billion worth of crypto which we can verify. Therefore is it really all to far fetched to believe that a crypto currency exchange with billions worth of crypto currencies also has at least $600 million USD to make the USDT issues?"

In addition to this, Bitfinex creates artificial demand for USDTs via making sure the margin rates on their margin market are extremely high, 30% PA, so a lot of people park their USDTs there instead of trying to withdraw (and realising there is no way out). This helps the scheme go longer."
I haven't looked into this at all, but it seems like in the system you have described that company has the ability to effectively print dollars at will. Is that accurate? If so, isn't that a huge moral hazard? 
Then why doesnt the CME group include Bitfinex in the Bitcoin price index for the Bitcoin futures? Dont tell me they are deluded too.
USDT isn't traded on Bitfinex. Bitfinex trades USD and allows users to withdraw in either fiat or USDT. Bitfinex redeems USDT for USD on a 1:1 basis which is all that backs it. Kraken however doesn't do this and does in fact trade USDT/USD free floating. This is why you sometimes see USDT trade slightly above or below $1 on Kraken.

Ver literally deposited $150 million worth of BTC to Bitfinex during the BCH pump. $150 million worth of BTC from an address tied to Bitcoin.com moved funds into Bitfinex moments before BCH prices FOMOed.
is that real? do you have link? : |
BTC crash + BCH crash = RIP BTC forever, long live BCH after recovering.
Yes incoming, as in imminent. 
Sorry, I'm not native English if that usage is wrong
600 million printed so far...
"The argument is that the timing of these 20 million dollar buy ins is very suspicious because it *looks* like someone is just manipulating the supply and demand.

The real question of course is if these tether have any real money behind them, or not."
Explain?
This strategy of yours breaks if Bitfinex becomes insolvent.
"Let me explain in very simple words how this whole thing works:

1- Bitfinex does not have access to banking, and so nobody can deposit or withdraw USD.

2- Tether is the exclusive way to get ""USD"" onto the exchange.

3- Bitfinex exchanges USDT balance at a fixed 1:1 rate into USD within their platform.

So this is how it works:

Sucker A deposits USDT

Bitfinex converts that balance at 1:1 into ""USD""

Sucker B sells some bitcoin, getting Sucker A's ""USD""

Sucker B must then convert this ""USD"" to USDT before it can be withdrawn.

So Bitfinex doesn't need any actual USD because they force people to convert it 1:1 for USDT anyway. Literally all they do is take the ""T"" off the end of the symbol, no USD ever changes hands, these are not USD markets. You cannot deposit or withdraw USD from Finex.


Look at USDT/USD on Kraken and the difference between BTC/""USD"" on finex and BTC/USD on any non-tether market."
I believe so, if BCh price is 5k at the time i believe it could drop to 3500 or equivalent %... but this is a personal opinion and guess, i am pulling numbers out of my *** x)

"Lol

He admits he doesn't give a shit about peer ran nodes.

I follow his Twitter..it's hilarious.

He realizes that MOST of the people supporting bitcoincash don't understand how the nodes protect from leverage and he's playing the shit out of you.

You admitted you have no idea.....but you still stand your ground.

As for the comments, many of those people are like you and simply shrug when asked about peer ran nodes. (Because you don't understand it yet) so why would I care what a bunch of meme warriors have to say? ( Most likely the same fools who keep parroting the lie that bitcoincash IS Bitcoin)

I didn't understand nodes two years ago either, so I humbled myself and learned that portion.

Without peer ran nodes bitcoincash is a shit coin, coup coin, whatever you want to call it.....but it will never be BTC.

"I'm not technically versed enough to agree or agree with that, but Roger Ver is not speaking for all of the BCH community, as much as others want you to think that he does.

Yes there might be a problem with nodes right now, but I think that can be fixed with adoption."

Have you seriously missed the huge amount of people asking about bitcoincash nodes?

It amazes me that NONE of the bitcoincash supporters understand or care about this.

Lol"
There's still a strong correlation betwen Tethers being gernerated and the BTC price moving up again. Look at the charts.
No I have neither. But if I'd see the use, I could easily afford to run a node, even on 10GB blocks.

It ballooned it with trash.

....and everyone in this sub is blind to that FACT.

Hilarious.

I'm reading every single word, yet when people show you evidence you discard them as nonsense while you still fail to come up with evidence for your claims.

It was AWS.

I m pretty sure that part is above your head OR you are choosing to ignore PROOF.

It was from AWS instances

Your making points that I've already disproven.

Try reading my posts COMPLETELY.

Then don't argue shit you don't understand. 
"
Again, correct me if I'm wrong, but for an average there need to be even higher values for part of that 3h time window. Also the graph very clearly shows you that the overall hashrate stayed roughly the same in that time window. Only towards the end where BCH hashrate peaked it went down with BTC also going down so it means that hashrate just went offline. The BCH hashrate didn't come out of thin air alone, a lot can be attributed to the BTC hashrate moving over.
"""at some point""

Read the post from earlier about AWS being shilled into your network.

Or don't ,but it makes you look silly to have that data given to you then make a horse shit claim like this.

Notice the ENTIRE fucking network spiked then fell flat....... BTC hash rate kept 68% of it's core.

Bitcash had some magic hash rate that did NOTsupport your proof of work and dissipated like a fart in the wind.

Hint::: it was horse shit AWS.
Part of the farce during the pump and dump.

"
"Learn the math before you dispute shit.

That is based on a three hour rolling average. You'll learn that equation the first week you run a miner.

Bitcash has never had more than 28% steady for more than a few minutes sporadically. (12 minutes at 33% was your highest rolling average.

68% of BTC hash rate never budged.  

Now would you like me to explain how the bullshit AWS instances made your tiny hash rate look higher for minutes at a time sporadically? You had blocks that were hashed by the whore miners when your difficulty was down, then they returned to BTC when your easy blocks were done. That along with bullshit AWS instances spiked your hash rate.  

Your proof of work never showed the increase...... As a matter of fact it slowed during that time because your network was transmitting horse shit AWS...lol

BTC miners aren't going to jump ship easily. ESPECIALLY to a network without peer nodes. Lol

All your going to get are Chinese profiteers mining your cheapest coins then switching back.

Your being duped.

None of the people I've debated with on r/BTC  actually understand any of the things I present to them...... But they all act like they do.

No one on this sub understands shit about nodes, mining, or the inherent protections needed.  Honestly out of the last 23 people who have tried to call me out.....NONE of them have a fucking node or have ever contributed to the network by mining.

Your being duped. Plain and simple.

Until you can tell me who is running all the AWS instances and PRIVATE nodes for your network you cannot even call that shit crypto....let alone fucking Bitcoin.

For all you know it's a centralized bank in China trying to Trojan BTC.....and your helping out of blind partisanship.

"
"https://fork.lol/pow/hashrate

Clearly shows that at some point BCH was getting close to 70% so you can't just come around and claim the BTC has 68% that never even moved."
"@3500 in the USA currently doing so for BTC.  

Those numbers v were based on 10 gig blocks.

The numbers, locations on the network are known are because they are PEER nodes.

Your numbers, locations are not available. So they are not peer nodes.

Your being duped. Your network is entirely AWS  and some secret bullshit located in China on the same good damned city block as their largest fucking bank.
"
"Honestly, what just happened was a pump and dump attempt to flip the coins.

They just didn't take into effect the immense amount of hash rate BTC miners have at their disposal. (I fired up 4 old rigs just to shore the network as well as many small scale miners did)

The scary thing is this was just a probe of our defenses. They will try again next fork.

Our core hash rate is concrete though. (@68% of the entire network) and never moved.

Your core is around %2 of total network exahashes.
"
"Think about it like this....

With banks you use a ""trusted peer"" aggreement with the people who run the credit card machine NETWORK.
 
With Bitcoin, the ""trusted peers"" are the nodes.

If Bitcoin cash has no nodes except ones set up by a financial conglomerate , and it takes BTC's place....

... You are back to a debit card from a centralized back,....

"Okay, I really don't get you. Which normal BTC user can keep up with any of that?
I currently have 400/20 mbit/s down and up (I upgraded last year and I could upgrade to 500/50 already) and 40TB HDDs are cheap enough already that I could afford to buy new ones if needed. That's over 40mb per second download speed so I'm able to download up to 24GB in 10 minutes. From my understanding is possible to propagate 1 GB blocks through the network in a compressed format so your actual download is somewhere around 500 MB.

I can't comment on the security aspect, but again, you'd have to hold every user on the BTC network to the same standard and I'd love to know how many of them could actually do that. 

Please correct me if any assumptions I made are indeed wrong."
"This might very well be, but without any actual proof we're both just throwing arguments at eachother. I can't prove you wrong and your arguments so far aren't the best. 

But you've got me far enough into actually looking up more about peer nodes and their usefulness."
"It's not just Roger ver....

ALL your devs admit it.

They've been asked why the nodes are hidden.....

Roger ver actually laughed and said ,""none of your concern""

....easily?

Lol"
"Lol

Sure.

It also very well could mean....

""We already have all the nodes we need and the bank that is running then doesn't care about profit until they get control""

Lmao

It's called leverage.

Once they control your network they control the asset as far as any crypto currency is concerned.

As far as you know they already have your network.

I can easily prove they don't control mine.

All the facts point to them already controlling yours.

But hey a guy on Twitter didn't actually say it...... He just hinted.

"
All six teams agree peer ran nodes aren't important.
"I'll definitely have to look into this more, but like I said, Roger Ver is not speaking for everyone and that tweet is not representative of the BCH community as a whole.

I stand my ground because I think that problem can be tackled, but right now I feel it's important to get a stable footing first. Nodes and a decent node explorer might even be a good way to do that."
It says 'not everyone' that is a far fetch to claim nearly nobody will be able to run a node. It could very well mean 'only the majority of people, just not everyone'. Not everyone can run a node today. That is your claim?
"I can prove my nodes.

You cannot.

That is proof in and of itself.

Why hide peer nodes?

Think about it.

They are located in the same four mile area as the biggest bank in China.

And the rest are Amazon exceptions.(that's a known fact)"
"Most of you nodes are set up in fewer than 7 locations, but no one can tell for sure.  One thing is for sure, they are not peer ran nodes. By definition a peer ran node is addressed on the network....but bitcoincash nodes aren't.  Therefore they are NOT peer ran.

Which negates EVERYTHING that protects it from centralization.

If you don't believe me simply read the tweets of your devs, they don't plan on peer ran nodes.  They understand that it won't be affordable and don't care.

Their plan is to hand Bitcoin to the banksters by replacing it with bitcoincash with a centralized TRUSTED PEER AGREEMENT.  

you're already using a trusted peer network ,you are ok with it because of low fees.  Just wait until they have all the nodes...........

"
"And you may be a superior engineer to me. That I cannot say because we would have to meet in person and work together. I don’t write code like I used to as I’m now at an age where I have other interests that take my time.

But I do understand the importance of public discourse to decide the fate of the global financial system. 

I believe bitcoin must be a reserve system so that Bitcoin Cash can flourish. It has to act as a reserve currency so that litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, and any other new currency can grow and explore their own networks.

If bitcoin cash wants to be the king, it needs to make sure it works to allow other coins like monero and dash to be successful too. We can’t be dependent on just one coin, but we all need to agree on one store of value.

Or what’s the point of getting off the dollar?"
Yes, I'm not familiar with the node charts so I'm wondering what kind of information I'm supposed to get out of it.
How is paying fees to open LN channles any better? Those don't go to the miners that do the work, those go to people with big pockets that send the coins in your name in very big numbers. If LN would actually happen at some point.
"If you build a network on the Assumptions that the nodes are peer ran ,and it turns out that they are actually being ran by (insert financial Boogeyman) then what are your protections from said Boogeyman having control over the network?

Aside from peer ran nodes, which your devs have already said they do not care about or plan for.

Now I ask again ,who is running the majority of bitcoincash nodes?

"
"If a node is of unknown origin.

Is it a peer node?

Is it a central bankster trying to leverage control?

Is it a golem node waiting to interrupt, exploit or otherwise cause mayhem?

I am asking you WHO controls the majority if the bitcoincash nodes.

"
"Currently 86--93% of the sha256 nodes are BTC. @93% of the sha256 network hash rate is BTC.

Of the remaining 7%---@4% are peercoin,emark, etc

That leaves less than 3% of nodes to bitcoincash and bitcoincash controls @7% of the network hash rate.  (Off of 3hour averages)

Now you are asking why you can see BTC nodes but NOT bitcoincash nodes.  

Is that correct?
"
"Most of your nodes are probably ran by ICBC.

Sleep on it.

Later brother."
"Anonymous nodes are NOT peer ran nodes.

Anonymous nodes are what credit cards use.

Anonymous nodes are what debit cards use.

And they rely on ""trusted peer"" agreements.

Which is what bitcoincash has now.

They are anonymous, but you trust them."
"I pray it doesn't.

I don't want to see Bitcoin leveraged by the banksters.

That is what bitcoincash is being used for.

Unless you can figure out who is running your nodes, you are admitting that you don't care if it's centralized.

"
"What about the thread I opened? What about this link? 

https://bitnodes.earn.com/nodes/leaderboard/?q=ABC 

Is this not the information you wanted? That's quite a few nodes not running in AWS and all over the world. And that's only the Bitcoin ABC nodes."
"So wait, I'm confused. If I look at this then 88% of the nodes are owned by core. http://nodecounter.com/#nodes_pie_graph

Am I reading this correctly?

Also where can I see Bitcoin Cash nodes on that site? Stop calling them straw man arguments, I'm asking questions and you just dodge them."
"Okay you get one last post. 

Bitcoin Cash has the potential to be Bitcoin by definition. This didn't happen and it's very well possible that it won't. Fact is that according to what's stated in the whitepaper, Bitcoin Cash can become the official chain once it's accumulated the most proof of work. Again, at the moment that seems unlikely, but it's not impossible. "

"Look at the hash rate, the fact that BTC is going to be CME listed, it survived an obvious pump and dump and now it price returned to pre pump and dump levels.

It's a correction.

I can tell you that a flippening won't happen.

What is more likely is the death(or serious loss) of both coins due to public trust being lost.

Using bitcoins name is sad honestly.  Notice the name of the sub? Along with the often repeated LIE that bitcoincash is Bitcoin.

Bitcoincash is a ploy by billionaires to centralized and control the strongest crypto currency, by replacing it with a Manchurian candidate.

.....but it won't happen.

You'll never aquire the hash rate.

Or the peer nodes.

Or the public's trust and recognition (although this subreddit is a nice try at stealing the name recognition)"

Wait, that last statement is wrong.

Without peer ran nodes it WILL be centralized.

"Then why do YOUR devs admit that they won't be affordable once it scales to BTC levels? 

And why do your devs not care about peer ran nodes?

Your denying what your devs have already admitted.

You are arguing a point that your devs have stated as fact.

Bitcoincash's plan doesn't include peer ran nodes.

Because they are planning for a ""trusted peer"" most likely in the form of a gigantic Chinese financial conglomerate.

It's right is front if your eyes.

Without peer ran nodes bitcoincash is a shit coin. Plain and simple.


NOW please explain how a second layer network Service can cause any effect in the network.

It CANNOT. because it is a second layer service.  The same as being CAME listed. Those transactions do NOT occur in the Bitcoin network."
"Let’s start over.

I’m going to ask a question: Do you believe that bitcoin was created to replace the FED as the system that manages the global financial system?

I do. I believe it’s a new way that governments around the world can work within a new protocol that isn’t backed by any one country.

I believe bitocoin is being adopted by global powers in order to make a more resilient system.

Bitcoin needs to be able to both be free yet also work within regulatory frameworks of different countries all around the world.

The Core developers will replace the existing global system. They will work with central banks to make this our preferred system and make it as smooth a transition as possible without disrupting life around the world (causing war etc).

The USD will stop being the global reserve currency.
I believe Bitcoin was designed to do this given its design. 

Do you agree with this statement?"
"Where can I see proof of these claims?

Also isn't that the same argument that's made against SegWit, LN and BTC? I don't know what to say at this point and it's getting way too late for me anyway. So you have a good night and I'll just shut up now."
At least we agree on that. Bitcoin cash is not bitcoin. It can become bitcoin in it's own right once it accumulates more proof of work than bitcoin. If this will ever happen is anyone's guess. Fact is that this is how you're supposed to decide which fork is the right one according to the white paper no matter how unlikely that event may be. It bitcoin gold for whatever reason would manage to do that then it would be bitcoin, but since they changed the proof of work, that a whole other can of worms.
"LN channels? 

O_o

That has nothing to do with the nodes or miners, that is a second layer network service.

For instance when BTC becomes CME listed that will be a second layer network service. Completely separate from the network the miners and nodes run on.

Neither of those thing affect the network or currency in any way.

I am talking about all your nodes being unaffordable for anyone except giant entities that will seize control once they have all the nodes. (Or >51%)

No offense but it amazes me that everyone in this sub repeats the same parroted lie,(Bitcoincash is Bitcoin). But when you point out that their coin has no plans for peer ran nodes they shrug it off.

Without peer ran nodes, your handing bitcoincash to whichever bankster decides to set them up.

Since your devs admit that they don't care and since you obviously don't either.....have fun with that.

"When I started mining the existence and reason behind nodes was still pretty hazy to me.

When you really look into it. Those peer ran nodes are what keep BTC from being leveraged into a ""trusted peer"" aggreement that banks and traditional financial institutions have always relied in.  Basically the peer ran nodes are your ONLY protection from centralization.

"
"You can find the location of BTC nodes.

You can see them in a map.

They are not bunched up in one location.

They are spread out.

They are peer ran nodes."
"Your figuring out the same thing I did when I researched bitcoincash.

The nodes are clustered in HUGE bunches and they are not peer ran.

"I don't know how to say this in a way that you could consider it as the truth, but bigger blocks are affordable for a lot of people even today. 

And I know that LN and nodes are different topics, but saying that it won't have an impact on bitcoin is also a blatant lie."
"You know what could help with the FUD, mistrust, rumour etc? 
Key word is communication. i said it on some other channels but i think the community or rather the 400+ devs should vote on say 5 people that could speak for the team on news, roadmap and such. No power over BTC but be some sort of communication channel. 
Right now who knows what is going on and what being worked on???
When BTC was like 10-100 dollar this was fine. Now at 8k almost its big money involved and people want to know the answer to these issues. 
Not knowing what the team is working on and the progress on issues is what causing the FUD. I know people like to think Core is decentralised and say that word like its a holy grail but in the real world communication is key to success no matter what it is. 
Also the representatives can be changed once a year so that no one can get to much say about things. 
This is my honest opinion anyway. "
Will anyone go to jail?  If I money launder with Bitcoin, I'll go to jail. What do these guys get?  A slap on the wrist?

Three years since the goxing, about right for another. Lots of fresh money to take.
There are but im just terrible with links, im sure someone will share some. Check out the Faqs on the main r/btc page, should have some info in there about it. There is also something called Graphene (may be slept differently) you can look into. Gavin Andreson published a paper on it not too long ago. Im glad you are doing your research though and care to know the other side of the story. Keep digging, the truth will unveil its self slowly but surely. If you have other question down the road feel free to msg me:)
"can you help me understand the scaling problem with Bitcoin Cash?  I'm extremely versed in the scaling problems of Bitcoin Core so no need to explain the overall logistics, I just wasn't aware that Bitcoin Cash had a scaling problem.  It's currently operating with plenty of onchain spare capacity and blocks are planned to grow to 32X the Core chain before anyone needs to upgrade, so it seems like we've got several years of running room before we even hit that point.

could it be that there simply is no problem?"
Problem is now they have Hijacked Bitcoin. sad day i must say:(
"Yes.  ""Second layer"" off-chain solutions of various kinds are possible.  These would replace many smaller economic transactions with larger on-chain ones.  For example, if you fill up with gas regularly at one brand, they can allow you to pre-fund, or use credit with them, for multiple purchases, which are then settled with a single larger one.

My small credit union I bank with, assuming they adopt cryptocurrencies in the future, can relay customer transaction information off-chain to other such organization, and only settle up with each other daily on-chain.

Such off-chain solutions don't have to be adopted by everyone, but to the extent they are, they offload the transaction space.

In addition to that, there is no requirement that nodes have to be run by individuals.  Local communities can fund ""community nodes"" with higher grade hardware and bandwidth.  They would get a small monthly fee to defray costs, like people pay for VPN services today.  Their users can then run a light wallet instead of a full node.

In a world where 8 or 32 times as many transactions are happening, you can assume there are substantially more users than today, therefore enough users to fund community nodes.

Lastly, the existence of many cryptocurrencies and exchanges can ""shard"" the block size problem.  We don't all have to use the same ones, any more than the world needs to use a universal currency today."
Depends on how many nodes remain as the bandwidth requirements increase.
"Yeah gox was amateur hour. It was a card trading site that tried to grow up. Now there’s real money involved and the banks got a whiff of private side chain lock-in. 

Now the real criminals are in charge."
"I suspect the number of nodes will increase, as it's usually done when adoption increases.  I'm not sure what the problem is.  Running a node at scale isn't particularly expensive, not much different than running web or mail servers at scale, and there's an awful lot of those out there.

you put 32X the users and use cases onchain and I think there will be more nonmining nodes than we currently have, at least, more of the ones that really matter and help the network."
"The main problem is internet bandwidth caps.

The best internet I can get here is 100d/10u Mbps (plenty for a node), but it has a soft cap at around 250 GB per month. I *could* run a full node, but that would take all my data. This problem only gets worse as blocks get bigger. 

Unless our internet gets less shitty faster than blocks get bigger, the number of nodes is going to shrink. Will that be a problem? Only time will tell."
The point /u/jessquit is making is that as adoption increases, people with an actual interest in running a node (businesses, mining pools, large hodlers) will increase, and _those_ nodes are going to be well provisioned, 32MB nodes is chump change for a payment gateway even if you're just running a restaurant. Relying on volunteer nodes is both unsustainable and can even be harmful long-term for the network.
"> it has a soft cap at around 250 GB per month

where are you that you can't provision better internet than that?

you aren't talking about home internet are you?"
"> even if you're just running a restaurant.

well, if you're just running a restaurant, you'll probably use a merchant gateway regardless of what coin or technology you accept, because you're a restaurant not a payments integrator.  a restaurant shouldn't - and doesn't - have to validate all the world's transactions just to accept Bitcoin Cash.

but for the people provisioning your merchant gateway, 32MB blocks will be chump change."
Unless there's some weird person who runs a node without holding coin, there's no such thing as a volunteer node. Everyone who runs one is securing their own interests. 
Home internet, yes. My work internet is actually worse, sadly, though that's more due to shitty location.
Yeah, people with less technical knowledge can and will delegate. The point remains that the barrier to entrance will be really low, and remain so all the way up to... Idk, 256MB?
You don't actually need a node to secure your own coins, your private key does that, and you can't veto the main chain anyway if there's no economic activity or hashrate on your node - the main chain will just drop you. Unless you receive lots of payments on your node, running a node is really a volunteer activity.

Interestingly, BTCs horrible transaction fees and confirmation times have reached even the ZeroHedge comment section. Core trolls may be able to flood this subreddit with propaganda, but can they control the whole Internet?
Were they smart enough to use BTC to do it?
lol hypocrisy is the best policy? what now? At this digital age, we need crypto you know! :D
"...and we need to make sure everyone can actually use our crypto directly, or they'll come back peddling ""off-chain solutions"", and before you know it it's the history of gold all over again."
"It's nice to have this kind of news in this forum, so we don't need to have to visit the North Korean Bitcoin sub to get those ;)"
They should have used crypto...
Meanwhile, the value of all cryptocurrencies as a group ($230 billion) is approaching the net assets of JPMorgan Chase ($258 billion), which is the largest US bank.  Large asset value is a necessary step to replacing banks.  The world's economy is too big to handle with pocket change.
This is wonderful irony.
This is why we need crypto, to kill these banks. Laws can’t touch them, so we have to make them obsolete.
they will pay a small out or court, non binding, private fine.
they get more of your money for bailout. a criminal system isnt going to jail one of their own.

The idea that when things get more expensive they consolidate into the power of the few? That's a pretty well established concept. Though I do grant you that crypto is new territory.
"The problem of expensive things being consolidated to the few is the problem that can be solved by increasing the block size and eliminating the inflated usage costs of Bitcoin now. As fewer people can use it losses any hope of widespread adoption. It becomes something only for the wealthy.

If Bitcoin allows more transactions to be processed, and lowered the transaction fees to nearly nothing, then widespread adoption becomes possible. It would mean more nodes, and nodes with stronger connections that decrease network latency problems.

Cheap nodes also weaken the network against attack. A well funded organisation could spin up a lot of nodes on cheap Raspberry Pi's if it is that easy to run a node."
"You said

> I can barely afford one on my internet connection which is better than >99% of the US.

That statement shows you do not have any idea how little bandwidth bitcoin (BCH or BTC) uses relative to the speed of modern internet connections. Your statement that you manage hospital or enterprise networks is not true."
Everyone should have the ability to confirm for themselves that the system is fair.
Maintaining permission-less status and decentralization are the priority. If we lose those elements how is it any different from fiat? Transaction fee's are unfortunate and clearly not ideal so obviously the system needs to scale somehow. Is increasing the blocksize the only way to achieve that? I envision a world with billions if not trillions of transactions per second. blocksize increases before absolutely necessary are shortsighted. I've always been incredulous   with how money works in society today. We operate in such an unfair money system and most people don't care. Now that there's an alternative I don't want to lose what I believe makes it valuable. You and I are on the same team. We both want the same things, but maybe we disagree on how to get there. Which came first the chicken or the egg?
"Can you justify that statement, or are you just trying to avoid an uncomfortable truth?

The idea that bigger blocks would lead to network centralisation is itself a baseless assertion."
[deleted]
"I think the most important thing to remember is that the block size is only a maximum. Each block is not at that size unless the transactions needed to be processed are that high.

So if we said the block can be 1GB maximum they would not actually be that large unless the world did suddenly want to change and central banks began to fall over night. I think we both know that won't happen, or at the least wouldn't happen suddenly.

High fees prevent that wider adoption though. It stops businesses to want to use it. It prevents poor people from using it. This is why low transaction fees are more important than cheap nodes.

Say Bitcoin was used a lot more. VISA can process 10,000 transactions a second. That would be equivalent to a 1GB block size. People think that would make it so hard to run a node that very few would, and open the network to attack. The thing is every business that accepts Bitcoin, not through a third party, would run a node. So would enthusiasts. So would all exchanges and miners. So the node count would increase.

As it is if someone can not afford to use Bitcoin they have no reason to run a cheap node. Why make it so that the poor can afford to run a node, but not use Bitcoin? That sounds like the poor supporting the rich."
Sorry but you are REALLY reaching with this assertion.
You clearly do not understand networking basics or you would not make such flawed claims.
"That is exactly why running a node should not be as cheap as possible. To prevent that sort of thing from happening. If someone can easy put up a lot of nodes with $35 dollar computers then that kind of attack is easy.

Not to mention that nodes with horrible connections make network latency even worse, and make approving transactions slower."
"Hard drinks do not always split the community at all. Sometimes an update happens in the form of a hard fork. That has happened many many times already.

2nd layer's are possibly an option,but no good options have been put forward. Lighting Networks are a horrible design as it is.

8MB is not the end at all. It takes about 1GB to get the same numbers as Visa, but that obviously won't happen for a long timeas it is. The high fees have made it harder to spread Bitcoin adoption as it is.
If Bitcoin can not be used as a currency then all its value is just Tulip Mania."
"If someone can not afford to use the system th have no reason to value that system. It is absurd to make it so that people who can not afford to use Bitcoin are expected to maintain it. This is why cheap transactions will always be more important than cheap nodes.

As it is running a node with larger blocks is just as cheap as running a node with a 1MB block.

The only way that running a node would no longer be cheap is if there was mass adoption of crypto use. So even if nodes were expensive there would be more of them."
What is the plan once 8mb's isn't enough? Another hardfork? Hardforks split the community because there will always be people who benefit from supporting both sides. I don't want to split the community unless absolutely necessary. Is 8 Mb the end all be all? are 2nd layer scaling solutions an option? I just don't understand the urgency. Are transaction fees even that bad for the innovation that is bitcoin? I think they are a steal! Maybe I have a privileged first world perspective.

Say it with me: all-time high. 
Many people call it Bcash for two reasons. 1) To prevent new users from getting scammed into buying an altcoin. 2) The word cash describes money in its physical form of paper and coins. Coin-cash sounds like a feeble-minded repetition. Besides sounding silly, Bitcoincash is also too long. Bcash is a much better name.

Is it shazamable? 
I thought I was listening to an US vs THEM political ad.
100% correct. Also the people who are buying this have no concept or concern about the banks. Roger is basically showing that he really wants to get back together with Core.
Everyone here does realize that the fact that one person has the ability to pay for an ad campaign on 150 radio stations to sway public perception basically proves centralization exists in BCH and is a bad thing right?
I honestly think that forums and reddit dont react fast enough to the way crypto moves. I am a big fan of Discord and Slack to stay up to date and I like the real time interaction. [I hang out here in this discord](https://discord.gg/zze64vd). I like it because the majority of the members are crypto nerds like me who are extremely active in the market.

If it wasn't for our sweet boy /u/MemoryDealers, bitcoin would never be where it is today.
Calm down about the felon nonsense, he literally just sold some firecrackers on eBay.
"Imho we should mention the conflict every time we promote Bitcoin cash for a couple of reasons:

>If we don't, many people will just assume the ad is about bitcoin


>If people notice that these are two separate coins we are talking about, we need to clarify why they have similar names. Because otherwise we do sound like a Chinese ripoff / scam (Bitconnect also shares the same starting characters, this is no coincidence) 


>The arguments are on our side, and if a person who vaguely knows bitcoin hears them, it might sparkle interest

That being said, I'm sure criticism is welcomed by everyone so that future ads could be perfected.

My only piece of advice is that we should totally mention that MOST of the original creators and promoters of Bitcoin have left (been kicked off) Bitcoin and moved on to this project.  This should really ring a bell."
I don't know-i find it hard to believe that a small group of successful billionaires who have a great plan to control the future of the world's money supply would just haphazardly throw money into a campaign like this without thinking it through.

"More importantly, ads need to answer the ""*What's In It For Me*"" question for the audience. Most people have barely heard of Bitcoin (if they are involved, they likely didn't need the radio ad to change their mind), and the ad need to educate and entice. Basically, think about what your audience cares about (difficulty of transferring money, flexibility) and target that, rather than focusing on making a political point to make yourself feel good. Most people couldn't care less there are now two forks.

Edit: typo"
"This really is a terrible ad.  Why would people who are not invested in crypto, many because it's seen as a speculative timebomb, want to invest in something so strife ridden?

"I understand this crit, but considering the medium channel it's well calculated or at least not bad considering the demographic it's reaching. 

Who listens to radio? I imagine this as an ad on The Kingdom of Nigh hosted by that dude from his trailer in the desert. Art bell. Or similar late night AM dial demographic. For them, this is a good ad. "
"Agree. Also: ""If you believe that bitcoin was meant to be a low cost, easy to use, peer-to-peer currency (...)"" 2 weeks ago I had no idea if that was what it was meant to be. It speaks more to people that already are into crypto than outsiders. If I played this for my wife she would be absolutely unable to tell what bitcoin or bitcoin cash is/was about if I asked her after. 

Edit: With all the other stuff going on here in terms of marketing - why not get a couple of people together to write and maybe even record a couple of voice-overs that could be used for stuff like this?"
From the language of the post, it looks like Roger did it on his own.  I can absolutely see him writing a script (the ad sounds exactly like some of his YouTube videos), then finding a voice-over guy to read it.  Radio stations could care less what the ad sounds like, just as long as it falls within FCC guidelines.  
"We don't need hobbyists to run nodes. It was never meant to be like that after a certain point, which we are well beyond.

If a business can afford the fees associated with accepting credit cards, they can afford the cost of setting up a full node.

We're discussing 1GB blocks, by the way... something that is years and years and years away... so businesses can easily run a Bitcoin Cash node on a $300 machine today, like I do at home.

So this problem you're trying to avoid of it being too expensive is not even an issue at the moment. It only becomes an issue when blocks become very large, at which point, it will be much cheaper than it is today to run a node that can handle it.

You need to think outside of the current paradigm."
"You don't need to personally.

What it comes down to is have low costs to run a node and what happens? Hobbyists, small business, media business, and very large business with data centers run them.

Okay now we increase the cost to run a node. We'll now no more hobbyist but run a node but hey small business, medium business, and larges ones still do.

Ok now we increase to costs of running a node more. Now even the small business stop doing it because it's two expensive. So they out source it to the medium and large businesses.

Okay now we need more transaction capacity. Alright now it costs too much for the medium business. Why would they pay thousands of dollars when  the large business will let them use their nodes?

Oh now there's only a handful of large businesses running nodes, enforcing the ruleset, propagating transactions, validating blocks. Well then it's suddenly centralized. That also means it's easy to censor transactions for them. It's easy for them to know who's sending what too. 

Decentralization is dependant on having many small little participants in the network. The more little participants having a tiny role the more decentralized. The less participants the more centralized.

The bigger the blocks the more centralized the smaller them more decentralized. That's a fact. Every time we increase block size that much he acknowledged. Of course there's no point to a super decentralized network that can't be used either. But simply increasing block size as a solution for everything doesn't help to keep the network decentralized. "
"Moore's Law dude. In a few years, that few thousand will be one thousand. A few years after that, a few hundred... And so on.

You don't need to run a node. Businesses need to, in order to validate transactions. To the average person, Bitcoin is a private key.

Give me a valid reason why you, personally, need to validate every transaction on the blockchain."
">  for a few thousand dollars.

Yep. That's the problem. If you need a few thousand dollars to run the only P2P part of the network for a node that generates you zero revenue then why would you use it? You want you'll out source those costs to someone else who is. But if a node can be run on $300 hardware (which is certainty can today and with larger blocks as well of a few MB) and do it on consumer broadband then then you (be it a hobbyist or a business) 

It's not just hardware too. It's internet bandwidth restrictions too and block propagation time across the network. 1 GB blocks would require gigabit internet.

Miners don't want 1 GB blocks either. Especially since many of them are in China where internet infrastructure is week. Big blocks increase orphan rate. Even if the hardware can handle it it's a matter of distributing that block across the entire network of nodes around the world, have each of them verify it in full, and then make sure that this all happens in the time span of 10 minutes, if it takes 11 minutes the system starts falling apart and it can't remain decentralized.
