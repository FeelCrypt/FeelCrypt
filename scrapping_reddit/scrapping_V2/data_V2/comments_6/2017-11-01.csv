Satoshi is playing the Stranger in Strange Land long-con.
"I think the point is if fiat collapses crypto's will gain legitimacy. In 90's in Russia Webmoney risen (similar to Paypal, only registered in Belize and has cryptographical protection beyond SSL (and by the way they used 2FA way before anyone else used it for payments online and they also had arbitrage). You can compare them to eGold, LibertyReserve and Perfect Money. They've risen because they performed one thing government money couldn't ever - protect the value. Everything else - all the infrastructure grew out of this. It was so shady that you would buy WM on the street and sell it on the street on some crazy IT and radio market in Moscow.

When I first heard of Bitcoin I assumed it was that type of company. It didn't help Ripple was widely advertised back then and it **was** that kind of thing. A private company issuing tokens which are *supposed* to be backed by something. That's why I thought it's a fad. Then I started listening and getting memos that it's traded. I thought ""how preposterous!"". An asset which doesn't exist gets traded. Then I saw its rise to $30 and disregarded it ""meh"".

Then 2013 came in. I looked into it and thought ""yeah I don't care I'm just gonna make money on this like some pyramid scheme it is"".

And only then I read the whitepaper when it started going down and I ""lost"" (not really) some money and **HOLY FUCK**. It turned everything upside down in my head. I'm an IT professional. Basic Cryptography is a requirement for my work. Holy shit it dawned on me how easy it was to read for everyone and how easy it was to understand. It is so fucking simple (compare it to Lightning Network WP or any long RFC you'll see what I'm talking about) yet so laconic and to the point that the only thing you think about is ""why no one else even *thought* of this before!?"".

That was about moment I started going crazy due to realisation, also bought some coins with credit card... and paid it off (no financial advice involved, just saying how crazy I was).

**From that moment on I started thinking Bitcoin.**"
absolutely!
Dr. CSW, thanks for Bitcoin. We believe you!
cool story! Your conflating a difference in definition of 'soon' to sniff your own farts. I hope it smells tasty!
What happened here?
"This is inaccurate. They left some 10 months after one person made a public announcement that the CIA had asked him to do a presentation on the subject. 

The hornest nest comment from wikileaks and more, none of it backs up what you are saying. So I have to ask you where did you get your information, because I can guess. "
"Not to discount the great achievements of the past century of course, we'd have none of this without brains like Einstein, Feyman, Tesla, and many other extraordinary people.

I am referring more to right now which is the beginning of the next great paradigm shift that be the underpinning of the next 100 years of astounding scientific achievement, which will be monetized in a way never before possible. "

What a great historic moment! 
"Most certainly.

There was a point for me when I started to really dig in deep into how the banking system works in the US, and the more I understood the sicker I felt. I hit a deep point of total despair that this sick, evil system was how the world worked.

The second I got into Bitcoin, it instantly became to me the sword by which we slay this monster after 100s of years of injustice and financial slavery."
Thanks for the clarification! 
Just to be clear - I don't have any inside knowledge from Blockstream, the NYA signatories or any of the relevant companies really. So it's not as much a confession, as an observation from an outsider.
It really doesn't, and a lot of people who believed their propaganda or never left the echo chamber are going to be hurt when this goes down. We can't let a dev-led corporate takeover like this happen to Bitcoin ever again. 
I was banned for saying the same thing. 
"The tragedy of the commons when it comes to transaction fees being driven down to 0 due to the increase of block size can be mitigated by the miners overtly limiting how low they will go to include any transaction in a block. If a miner wants to include cheap transactions, it would be their choice, while others would want to set a reasonable fee that would be both acceptable by the market and profitable for them.

We had something similar years back when miners stopped accepting 0 fee transactions.

On the other hand, some people might see that as the miners exerting unjust control over the network by limiting which transactions will make it to the blocks."
So true! Current block size limit is tiny. I run a full node and don't care if it's 1 meg or 16 megs. My phone data plan could handle a 1 meg limit. My home connection sees this as background noise..... I agree entirely that there is a point at which block size gets unreasonably large. But it's unreasonably small right now.
"My general stance is that nobody really knows where this is going, so we should be weary of singling out one side of the debate as ""the right one"". Ideally, both would be able to present their case on an equal ground. This way, in case your own judgement is wrong, you're not imposing that error onto others.

That being said, I've seen some projects trying to take advantage of such open forums with astroturfing and vote manipulation. /r/CryptoCurrency has been a target for many pumps and dumps over the years. It's rather hard to say with certainty at times whether there is genuine support for a given idea or post, or is there some manipulation going on. This can go for either or both sides of any important debate really.

All in all, I see the benefit of what Blockstream is trying to achieve - Bitcoin can be a lot more useful with a second layer solution built on top of it, but that doesn't mean we should be neglectful of the on-chain transaction needs."

What is bitmain and bitcoin.coms business model? How do they profit from bitcoin cash?
"That is a perfectly reasonable interpretation. And as developer myself I have to agree with this approach. The internet is a layered set of protocols. This allows both scaling AND specialization/efficiency. The internet would have never gotten to where it is if every functionality it enables had to be added to a single layer. 

I won't comment on how i feel the BTC development cycle should progress as both sides of the debate  have been argued ad infinitum. But with that in mind, I'm not against increasing the block size in lockstep with the organic growth of the least capable piece of the system. I think it's well agreed at this point that propagation bandwidth is that weakest link. As it grows internationally I hope so too will the block size. 

 I'm bullish on Bitcoin because I believe the quiet, calm, majority is in line with my opinion on this. With block capacity increases like Segwit, 2nd layer solutions both LN and future innovations, and most importantly block size growth tethered to physical system bottlenecks, I think Bitcoin has a bright future indeed. 

And before some raging zealot starts screaming about Core and limiting block size. I don't think 2MB blocks would appreciably harm the network at this very moment. I do however think we should have at least a few hard fork necessary upgrades tested and ready to apply along with the block size upgrade if only to reduce the number of necessary hard forks. "

Commodore 64 in the late 90s????  Even in  90s that thing would have been ancient.  We had commodore 24s with the tape drives as early as 1983 and the 64s in '84 or '85 along with the apple IIe.  They also did not sit  around collecting dust as u/machinez314 flippantly states.    
In the UK, the Spectrum and the Acorn/BBC Micro were also very big. Nostalgia nerd on YouTube does amazing 80s computer documentaries - and he covers Atari, Amstrad, Commodore and more international names. The C64 did well here too and the Amigas.
I did not get one of those (C64) until the late 90's I believe (and it came with a spread-sheet cartridge).
Half the people I knew had Commodore 64, Apple IIe, Amiga or cheapo Magnavox. So either I was born in a 3rd world nation after 1995, or Western Nation before 1995.
"Your analogy makes me think you were born after 1995.

"While I agree with you 1000%, don't expect 99.8% of current Bitcoin hodlers to know how to do anything outside of input their Credit Card number at Coinbase. 

Think about the PC adoption pre-internet. For many the PC was something that they heard a lot of buzz about, they bought it. Then it just sat there gathering dust until a killer app called the internet came along. We haven't even seen the killer app for the Blockchain yet."
"If you don't have the private keys, they are not your Bitcoin.

Nice dodge.

At the Exchange. When you buy at the exchange, do you see your purchase on the Blockchain. Nope. But you are a hodler. Adoption is real. Just journaled at the exchanges until you send to an outgoing address."

That would be consistent with the rbtc narrative, yes.

Why would that help blockstream or be a better explanation of the above? Deliberately crippling other businesses would reduce the value and usage of BTC, which would reduce demand for BTC 2L solutions like what they’re researching/developing.
Exactly.  Blockstream have a vested interest in ensuring Bitcoin does not scale at all on-chain, not even one little bit, so that they can then sell their solution to the problem.

"Liquid has consistent 1-minute blocks with no variance and a binary ""confirmed""/""unconfirmed"" status and Confidential Transactions and a richer script system than Bitcoin. Increasing Bitcoin's blocksize would give it exactly zero of these features, but it would make them all less expensive for Blockstream (and its customers).

Adam's quote doesn't bear out the ""Blockstream is trying to steal fees from miners"" conspiracy theory, nor does it make any sense. In fact the facts suggest the opposite."
I actually think the existence of BCH, ETH, and maybe Bitcoin Segwit2x fork is the main reason such a silly business model like this wouldn't work at all. I highly doubt a lot of btc companies will want to buy any crap machine from blockstream to validate transactions. It's like the dumb box on the silicon valley HBO series. Companies know it's full of shit, and will be ready to shift to the next working platform with most adoption. Also, it wouldn't be the only company to try and pull that out.

3.)Profit from expertise and custom development of software for organizations seeking to benefit from blockchain technology, driven by broad success of the still fully open source public bitcoin and generalized 2L solutions.

Very well written!  I admit I'm somewhat surprised by your analysis given that you're a moderator of /r/bitcoin.  Do you feel that what Blockstream is attempting (diverting the market towards their business model) will be beneficial to Bitcoin overall?  If not, how do you feel about the curated pro-Blockstream narrative of /r/bitcoin?
This is a battle for control of the lucrative fee market. Devs are trying to take it away from the miners without regard for the whitepaper. Does anyone here really believe the miners are going to let them get away with it and support legacy Bitcoin? This fork event is going to be epic. 
"LPT: It's always about money and power, which is why miners who endlessly invest their time and money get the power. Not the people who inherited a GitHub repo and use it to push inferior technology.

Blockstream's business model is going to continue falling apart. We get to watch exactly what happens when someone tries old tricks like regulatory capture (in this case developer capture, as they write the rules) in a fully public, free market environment. It was never going to go well for them, and they've proven themselves particularly ill-equipped to fight this battle.

Props for honesty.
"Nice blog post! Amazing that this is coming from an /r/Bitcoin moderator.

Let me just add one tiny but very important bit: The **only** way that the system is sustainable without inflation long term is **when the miners get properly paid.**

Remember the earlier FUD talk around blocksize? That of ""if you remove the blocksize limit, then tragedy of the commons at very low fees, yaddiyaddayadda!""?

But there is **no** sign whatsoever that the miners will ever go that route.


Now, am I willing to entertain trade-offs in on- vs. off-chain volume for censorship resistance through decentralization?

Absolutely. But is that at 1/4MB? Absolutely not. Did I repeatedly ask Core devs for realistic numbers? Absolutely. Did I ever get sound answers? Absolutely not.

And this similar experience of thousands of people is why the miners have to - and will win this."

WikiLeaks will share what they have. Deal with the truth instead of trying to moderate it because you can't handle it.
