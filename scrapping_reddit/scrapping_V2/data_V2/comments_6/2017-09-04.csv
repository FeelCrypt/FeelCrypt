The technical rebuttal is the millions of dollars stored in segwit addresses *now*. The longer they go without being stolen, the more wrong you are. 
Oh didn't you get the updated segwit shill playbook? You guys aren't using that one anymore because it's too bullshitty

Paying 15 sat/byte, assuming it will be confirmed in the next block (most likely not), would be 0.15$ for median transaction. That's not free (nor fast).
"> It is an opinion of disagreement. 

That's not how this is supposed to work. You people don't understand the point of this website.  "
"So my claim is true. Thanks...

Of course I didn't claim everyone can get the same rate. Just like I can't get a mortgage at as low a rate as an American 2 year fixed rate... that doesn't make the latter any less real either "
">You asked me to prove my 5% account exists. It does. As does the one I'm about to switch it to because the promotional rate is ending. Both have promotional rates, sure - but I've had a similar account for nearly 5 years now by switching every 1-2 years.

That's like saying credit cards don't charge interest because you can get a 0% APR intro rate. Obviously you need to include a qualifier. The idea of a savings account offering 5% (on anything other than a **promotional basis**) in the current interest rate environment is ridiculous. The 10 year treasury doesn't even yield half that for crying out loud. 

>The conversation is about ""you can't get 5% returns in 2017. Clearly, you can. 

With a **savings account**. Obviously you can make 5% returns elsewhere. "
"Indeed, thanks for doing the legwork for our sceptical friend

And /u/anti09, here's a bonus from another bank [Nationwide's FlexDirect](http://www.nationwide.co.uk/products/current-accounts/flexdirect/features-and-benefits), also fixed for 12 months at 5%

My favourite part of all of this is the idea that I've had to ""prove"" a simple statement that I have an account that pays 5% interest. I mean, they aren't super common, but they clearly exist and it's not even a particularly ludicrous idea. It's not like I've claimed to have an account that gives me a free exotic mammal once a month."
"It's not up to us to determine whether the tethers traded on Kraken are ""legitimately"" issued.  We simply provide the market.  The market decides what the value is.  Our concerns exist only at the technical/blockchain/protocol level.  Are these tethers fake or likely to be double spent?"
That's an introductory protional rate. It reverts back to 0.10% after 14 months. 
"Aaaaaand here it is...

"Absolutely.

And in about 2 moths I'll switch my Santander one to Nationwide's. Just like last year I switched my Barclays 4% 2 year rate to Santander's 1 year rate.

I'm not saying someone's handed me a perpetual 5% account, I was answering a comment saying it's impossible to get 5% rates in 2017... it clearly isn't.

Of course there's no guarantee any more of these accounts will exist in 12-14 months when my next promotional rate ends... but they've existed for at least the last 4-5 years, and the fact is that they exist now, which quite clearly responds to your ""proof or gtfo"""
"Every interest rate is promotional, some are just more open about it than others. Rates are subject to change, no rate is guaranteed.

The simple fact is that you can get a savings account right now that will give you 5% interest for 14 months. It's possible that there will be no alternative in 14 months, but that's entirely academic.

> That's like saying credit cards don't charge interest because you can get a 0% APR intro rate.

No, it's like saying 0% APR intro rates don't exist because they are time limited.

Like I said, I've had 5% interest on my savings account for just under 5 years by switching accounts between banks. Equally I've had 0% interest on my credit card purchases by switching credit card providers regularly.

If you want to make the most of your money, you have to move it. That applies to savings accounts, stocks, funds, bonds etc. You find the best current rate, then move your money when it expires.

I don't see why you're making such a fuss over a time limit on the rate: of course you have to re-evaluate in a year's time: interest rates change, both at an account level, and at a national level. In 3 years time the base rate may be 6% and 5% on your savings would look rather foolish."
"And?

You asked me to prove my 5% account exists. It does. As does the one I'm about to switch it to because the promotional rate is ending. Both have promotional rates, sure - but I've had a similar account for nearly 5 years now by switching every 1-2 years.

Or has your ""proof or gtfo"" (implying that the account doesn't exist) now become ""erm, proof that someone will give you the same account for 10 years?""

The conversation is about ""you can't get 5% returns in 2017. Clearly, you can."
"The original claim was ""I get 5% back on my 0-risk savings arrount"", without qualification. All that's been proven is that U.K. residents can get up to 5% for a very short period of time on a tiny amount of money if they open a new savings account and meet certain conditions. I'll concede that. "
"Those are introductory promotion rates for balances up to Â£2,500. It reverts back to 1% after a year (which is also quite high for a savings account). It's a loss leader. Also that's for UK customers only which isn't what was being discussed in a thread about USD tethers, but whatever. 

The idea of a 5% savings account in the current interest rate environment *is* ludicrous which is why I knew it didn't exist. The 10 year treasury doesn't yield half of that.         "
"That's a little different, though: I'm claiming a specific interest level on something that we're aware charges interest.

But again, if you said ""My credit card doesn't charge interest"" that's different to saying ""I have a 0% interest credit card"" - if you'd said the latter, I'd assume it's for a fixed term and reverts to a higher rate later, and also that you're likely to switch to another 0% once that one expires"

Doesn't that just send BCC matching the value of reddit gold? I think it's just one of the amounts you can ask the bot to send.
"> It's a great idea for those who issue it. Basically issuing money at will. It's not that different from fiat, is it?

I wonder who's behind it. Could it be the brilliant architects and implementors of the current fiat regime?"
">So my claim is true. Thanks...

Sure if you ignore the various qualifiers and restrictions you omitted to mention. Hey, did you know my credit card doesn't change interest?"
"> $340 million and I believe this money is fake, because nobody in their right mind would buy Tethers

Who owns those senseless tokens?!? Why don't the sell those tethers for crypto immediately. Or for USD for that matter?"
It actually gilds the posts. You can see it from the yellow icon.
I'm assuming what would happen in this case is anyone holding USDT on exchange (or off exchange) is screwed, they've basically been wiped out of their holdings. On these USDT/BTC pairs (or any USDT/Other_Coin pair), all of a sudden there would be absolutely nobody willing to sell their coins for USDT, only bots that are oblivious to the event, and existing sell orders. Anyone lucky enough to place a market order with their now worthless Tethers right before the market is frozen will be fortunate (if this window even exists), anyone who misses this narrow window will be out of luck. If this window exists, it will cause an immediate price surge on these exchanges, and of course immediately after the markets are frozen this is likely to cause some major panic across all other platforms, people will seek refuge in actual fiat, not Tether on the platforms that offer actual fiat pairs. 
Unbacked Tether is what caused this price hike from March til August.
A couple hundred million dollars making the fucking retarded assumption that every single tether is being used to prop up BTC is not enough to move a 50 billion dollar market.  Do you people even think?
Tether is like Willy-bot on steroids.
