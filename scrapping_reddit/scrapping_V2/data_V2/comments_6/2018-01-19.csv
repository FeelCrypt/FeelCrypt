I agree with most of what you said EXCEPT the privacy part. I'll give one example and I encourage you to think more deeply on the subject. Imagine you go to a movie theater, and pay for your ticket in BTC or bch or LTC or any clear coin. Now, today, tools to track actual WALLETS are mostly only used by governments, but those tools already exist. Let's say in an effort to maximize profit, this movie theater implements one of these tools. Ok so you go up to the line, pay for your ticket, and go to buy popcorn or candy. Since they know where that money came from, and the tool they have allows them to pretty much map all your activity on the blockchain, they can get a pretty good idea of how much money you have in whatever crypto you paid them in, how often you move money around, what amounts are involved, etc. They don't need your entire, intact financial history, because what they're doing is basically just guessing at how much money you have, and thus how price sensitive you are. They can charge higher prices to you, and expect that you'll pay them, because they know you have a lot more money than most other people. That's a problem. A lot of people agree that it's a problem, but either don't think it's possible, or there's not enough incentive for businesses to implement a strategy like this. Both of these objections are unfounded. It is possible for me to personally comb through someone's wallet history on the blockchain, and have a decent idea of their financial footprint. It is getting much, much easier for AI and machine learning to take this to the next level, essentially turning these fractured efforts at individual deanonymization into a big Sudoku game. KYC/AML ensures they have enough numbers to start, and it's not very difficult to fill in the rest. This is already happening, and companies like elliptic and chainalysis are refining their methods everyday. As for the incentives of the movie theater, they don't have to tell you what they're doing, because it's not an invasion of privacy. You put that information into the public domain, and so there it is, forever.

No, it's just picking a different path. Sure, you can fix malleability in a different way – just do it. So far, I hear that BCH plans it for November 2018 so it's definitely a year behind.

Nobody's under any obligation to feed the troll. 
"**Champagne**

Champagne (French: [ʃɑ̃.paɲ]) is a type of sparkling wine and type of an alcoholic drink produced from grapes grown in the Champagne region of France following rules that demand, among other things, secondary fermentation of the wine in the bottle to create carbonation, specific vineyard practices, sourcing of grapes exclusively from specific parcels in the Champagne appellation and specific pressing regimes unique to the region. Most people use the term Champagne as a generic term for sparkling wine, but in many countries, it is illegal to label any product Champagne unless it both comes from the Champagne region and is produced under the rules of the appellation.



Primarily, the grapes Pinot Noir, Pinot Meunier, and Chardonnay are used in the production of almost all Champagne, but a tiny amount of pinot blanc, pinot gris, arbane, and petit meslier are vinified as well. Champagne appellation law allows only grapes grown according to appellation rules in specifically designated plots within the appellation to be used in the production of champagne.

"Yes a calculated ploy to act in every way as a member of a broad decentralized community. Thank god this place exists to see right through nullc and his evil plans for Bitcoin domination.

By the way does anyone have any tinfoil they can spare? My hat keeps falling off."
I thought Ver controlled BCH?  Or Jihan?  I'm confused which rBitcoin narrative I should be following...
"He pretty much [singlehandedly turned](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7ktnth/thoughts/drhhpt4/) the rbitcoin community against segwit2x.

He also created the (pretty much baseless as far as I have been able to find) idea that bitmain opposed segwit based on ASICBOOST.

He drove the plan for ""scaling"" Bitcoin - which completely rejected blocksize increases - even though a large number of core developers supported a blocksize increase at that time.

He put Luke Jr in charge of BIP's, something he knew would be the final straw for Gavin to quit Core.

I'm sure there's more.  I'll update if I think of them or if someone reminds me of them.  This has been going on for years."

Nailed it
"...And, He's ""self-taught"" --No official training in computer programming(from what I understand.)"
How do you enjoy your $20 BTC transaction fees?
So what's his endgame then?
"> He pretty much singlehandedly turned the rbitcoin community against segwit2x.

I disagree. I think this was the work of some PR agency. The same that did UASF likely did NO2X as far as I can see.

I suspect this might be seen in retrospective as that one major mistake of old money that might upend the old financial order.

Up to and including the S2X part, they had their hooks in the system and a good chance of controlling and shepherding it.

By stopping 2X, they overdid it to their own eventual disadvantage."
"> He [Gregory Maxwell] also created the (pretty much baseless as far as I have been able to find) idea that bitmain opposed segwit based on ASICBOOST.

After a few weeks of spreading that accusation and threatening that he (Gregory Maxwell) would personally write the source code to change the protocol rules to disable the possibility of covert Asicboost, Jihan Wu (co-founder of Bitmain and Antpool) tweeted that if Gregory Maxwell would write the code to disable the possibility for covert Asicboost, then Jihan Wu and Antpool would vote yes to activate that code. Then suddenly Gregory Maxwell stopped talking about Asicboost and never created any such code. 

If even Jihan Wu would vote yes to activate such code, then why didn't Gregory Maxwell write and release such code? It's likely because the effect of using Asicboost was too small to matter and Gregory knew it but chose to pretend that he didn't know it, as political retaliation against Jihan Wu for voting no for Segwit and yes for a bigger base blocksize limit."
">He put Luke Jr in charge of BIP's, something he knew would be the final straw for Gavin to quit Core.

[In light of this thread](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=62037.0) that is one of the most Machiavellian moves I have ever seen from a developer on an open-source project."
"I didn't mean to imply that it wasn't. I really like Linux a lot and have for many years and I think BDFL well describes Linus' actual role. 

On the other hand, If I could pick a single person to have removed from the history of Bitcoin to have positively influenced the project, it would without a doubt be Greg Maxwell. He's a malevolent dictator for life at best, and only if the world has no justice.
"
"I'll apply it to the situation for you then. 

RBF seems to fix the artificially created limited blocksize issue, it's opt in, but it destroys use cases (zero conf)"
Ah, I see. Lol, they hate you here, don't they. Have my upvote, tho.
This isn't true. You can't prevent someone from sending you a transaction. 
It might, however, the capacity will still be strained at peak times.  They aren't able to clear that many TX right now, even with huge fees.  The bidding will bid up fees again, and probably increase Segwit adoption.  After a short time, they'd be back where they are now, 6-8 months max.
"> he stopped believing it could work as designed.

This is a misunderstanding. He never thought it could work as designed. "
Yes.. that's m'y point...
I like how questions are trolling.  There are regular txns, and there are txns with the RBF bit set.  Which part is poison?
"Who said it was stealing? Jesus man you guys... 

My point is that GMaxwell will commit stuff on Bitcoin core and  BCH will get it too. Saying 'He can stay with BTC, Now we have BCH' is stupid, as BCH will get 99% the same code as BTC. And some of those commits will be from GMaxwell. So that was my point."

"People buy tangible collectibles because there is some underlying collectibility.

What if the collectible was created, marketed and sold as being an intangible store of value and nothing more?

If the whole point behind making the collectible in the first place was selling it to someone for more money, that's a Ponzi, or else the distinction is so gray and fuzzy as to be irrelevant."
I wouldn't care, but it actually is a very, VERY important distinction to make at this point in time.
You mean, build a natural Ponzi that works and then cripple it later on?
Don't be silly. Btc fees are ridicolous, even more so than western union.
"No, it's not a store of value. This is a term that's strictly defined in economics and for something to be called a store of value, it must meet three criteria. The Blockstream fork of bitcoin doesn't meet any of them.

True.  But still, I wonder if this wasn't simply planned for for the sake of appearance.  The way the post was written I could imagine it being designed to create an illusion of separation between Blockstream & the current set of BTC core developers with commit access.
"And the attribute is:

The ability to finish what you start?"
That's a pyramid scheme, but keep em coming.
Yes.  A recipient can refuse to accept RBF transactions to move forward with the transaction.  Same as they could arbitrarily refuse to accept a segwit txn vs. a regular txn.
I think 2mb would drop the fees to $0.10 as fast as people/wallets are able to adjust (a week?). The mempool would clear within days.

"> Many high ranking employees leave a dumpster fire of a company and issue out a nice resignation letter.

"I can read between the lines too, and what I read is that he's tired of the hassle of being in a management position.

Believe it or not, being in a management position actually takes away your ""power/influence"" over direct projects, since you're managing people, instead of being hands-on with projects."
And if he is still a co-founder and co-owner of Blockstream then why did he in his resignation announcement explicitly mention that his @blockstream.com email address will no longer be working? He probably left on bad terms.

Yeah he relinquished his commit access to the Bitcoin Core Github. When he wants to commit to it he has to have Wladimir merge it in.

"The thing about criminal activity is that you definitely can break the law and get away with it, and the smart criminals know this, hence why they only break the law when its absolutely worth it. Dumb criminals are the ones that regularly flout the law, and think they'll always be able to get away with it. For Greg, it may be that he's finally past the tipping point of flouting the law.

And I agree, Greg has had his moments, but he is not a sound decision maker. Give him a mathematical puzzle and put him in a corner, and he'll be useful. And thats not necessarily a bad thing, people have strengths and weaknesses after all, unfortunately Greg thinks hes above that, and can literally do anything, and be good at it, and that makes him a liability to any project where he has undue influence. I personally do not see him being capable of redemption, or resulting in his presence being a net positive."

It makes them easier to update with soft forks. Most development teams for cryptocurrencies don't have core's incredible aversion to hardfork. It's not a virtue being unable to update your software though, and fortunately the Bitcoin Cash devs don't share that defect with the Core devs. So updating scripting languages can be done sensibly with hard forks.

You'll also note that the differentiation mostly comes down to the underlying economic utility of the token. Additionally if you read elsewhere in the article it mentions all the ways that Ponzi schemes can be strengthened / sustained by limiting the transferability of the share / token.  In short the more BTC's utility degrades, the more it resembles a Ponzi or pyramid.

There may be critical distinctions between BTC and a Ponzi but I maintain that there is more to be learned by investigating the increasing similarities."
Your cheeky point was lost. You need to remember while you play 4-dimensional chess, us plebs are all playing checkers.
"I think your reasoning applies just fine to gold: gold had non-monetary uses (such as jewelry) which helped bootstrap it into position as a medium of indirect exchange. But also has plenty of non-monetary uses today which bolster its effectiveness as a store of value.

Importantly, having a widely accepted medium of indirect exchange is an economic good, in and of itself.  This is what most people miss: the good ceases to be just the token, but rather, the network of trading partners as a whole. That is the qualitative shift which occurs when something becomes a money.  There's no need for the value of the token to be recursive, nor is there conflict with or need for special, historical reasons why gold is primarily a store of value, though those do play a role, no doubt.

Bitcoin tokens are not typically valued for their *bling!* factor, nor do they have many other obvious non-monetary uses or utilities...but what they can serve as right now is a share of a valuable, censorship-resistant payment network; which helps bootstrap that token to be widely held and demanded enough- such that it forms a vast network of trading partners; a medium of indirect exchange. And the good itself becomes this, rather than just the token; and this then feeds back on its utility as store of value, just like with gold."

I'm aware of why they need a malleability fix. LN development and adoption is going to take forever though. A malleability fix could have come out a full year from now and have as little impact on BTC user experience as it is having now. There was no rush.

True, but everyone should understand some people here don't care too much about decentralization if that keeps their business going with low fees.

">I thought BCH was for big blocks to prevent a big mem pool full of transactions. Hence making less money for the miners...

The you've never understood the big block argument : worldwide adoption via cheap fees creates MORE revenue for miners because of the sheer volume of cheap tx's.

>And we don't know what Staoshi's vision is at the moment,

Likewise, there's no reason to suggest he's changed his original vision, especially given that non full blocks was the norm until recently that got us to here.

Look, no one is against innovation, especially LN. But to cripple onchain scaling while we need it most and to give LN pumpers time to maybe get it to work is just stupid. Bitcoin is now years behind where it should be. "
"Well, miners can't get all the fees if they can't process all transactions (big mem pool). They can make more money though, if there's a big backlog. So I don't get your point? I thought BCH was for big blocks to prevent a big mem pool full of transactions. Hence making less money for the miners... 

And we don't know what Staoshi's vision is at the moment, as we didn't get any news since 2013 (?).  It's like saying that anyone can have a gun in the USA because of the constitution, but not taking into account that the constitution was written some hundred years ago when guns could fire 1 shot each 10 minutes. 

That being said, technology gets more complex to be simpler for end users. That's what happened to the Internet and technological equipment in general. It didn't became simpler, it became more complex on the engineering side. You need complex machine to make tiny complex parts that can fit in a tiny phone... you can watch a video on a tiny device now.. and it's not because it's 'simpler' than what phones were before.

The blockchain is the same IMO. In the future, it'll get harder and harder to just update the block size and keep up with demand. You need something more complex. But here's the thing, the block size and transaction pool isn't the only problem here. Crypto in general is not usable for normal average users (my grandma will never be able to use that in its current state). It's also way too volatile to make sense to use as an every day transaction system and it's hard to use securely and not lose money. So all these problems will need to be fixed too. "
If a company were producing something that provided no utility, and selling it, I would honestly consider that the result of malinvestment, and therefore under the purview of a bubble type scenario. The reason I didn't answer your question is because a company isn't producing and selling bitcoin, it's a currency. Sure, the ones who already own it want to get more people into it, to make money, but that's true of stocks and every other asset class, too. That Bitcoin provides NO utility isn't true, it certainly is useful in some situations. If it did literally nothing, like bitconnect, I'd agree, but it's simply worse technology than other cryptos employ, not useless technology. I think it's overvalued, and therefore a bubble. 
Yes, to the degree that Bcore allows it - - > subverting Satoshi's original vision of p2p ecash by reworking the entire block format so as to advantage an entirely new parallel network that steals miner fees. 
My question first.
"Core as an organization avoids any consensus changes. Expecting that they should be the ones making consensus changes as opposed to the community is exactly what people in this sub are accusing them of doing. Do you really feel it's their role as reference client devs to propose and campaign for consensus changes? Some members who are part of Core may go on to campaign miners or node runners to make a fork, but Core absolutely does not.

>If the leaders of Core (and there are leaders!) truly wanted no control of the blocksize, they would have removed the limit entirely.

Removing the limit entirely both is controversial and a huge consensus change. Why would that be the action they would take if they don't desire to be the instruments of consensus changes?"
What role was this, out of interest? He clearly has no leadership skills whatsoever and a toxic personality to boot, it baffles me that two high-profile open source projects have let him worm his way into positions that he was in no way suited for. He's worse than Adam Back, at least Back had a good idea once even if it wasn't good enough to be implemented in practice and he's been trying to live off the back of it ever since.
Innovation = Bad.. Got it.
"Greater fool theory or MLM. ""Pyramid"" perhaps?"
Suppose that that product is a currency and as such not sold by a company. What would you call that?
"Do you really think members in organizations don't politicize and persuade? That is ridiculous. Just because it is an ""open organization"" doesn't mean there aren't leaders within it. Core is absolutely not a democracy nor is it a meritocracy. If the leaders of Core (and there are leaders!) truly wanted no control of the blocksize, they would have removed the limit entirely."
I never said he was a nice person.  But they did end up giving him the leadership position later, so clearly they got past all that behavior somehow.
"I have no idea. I'm not a developer so I don't know what are the complications or risks with hard forking. Maybe they thought it'll require too much resources which they prefer to allocate for segwit for L2 solutions.
Besides segwit is also a bug fix, so it's not only one step towards a specific L2 solution.
Considering the fact that LN developers themselves realize the main blockchain needs to have bigger blocks even with lightning, it seems to me like just which order do they prefer to do these stuff, and honestly I'm not 100% convinced that's the right order. But I think it's a good question I'll try to get an answer for."
Bitcoin as money doesn't need to be complicated nor keep up with all the latest fancy tricks. In fact, too much tinkering causes uncertainty as to the immutability, sov, and ecash characteristics, like we've seen with core the last several years. 
Yea I was on champagne not shampooing sorry ^^
Honesty. There.
Sometimes the ability to be dishonest is a highly-valued trait. Poker players and spies are probably two of the best examples. Of course, every human needs some amount of honesty to survive, at least internally, but for software devs it is king amongst all other attributes. 
Malleability was not a problem, but it was an angle used to convince people there was value to SegWit.  BCH has already fixed one form of malleability for all transactions, not just for SegWit.
">It doesn't need to be one or the other

We have reason to believe it does mean one or the other, that's why this split occurred in the first place.

>Unfortunately, Core has forced Bitcoin into one of the extremes thinking they can ""solve"" decentralization while creating a network that only a relative few can use.

Who do you think core is? How can you imagine they have an opinion or have forced anyone to think anything? It's an open organization of hundreds of people. If you were to argue it has a leader there is no compelling argument that leader is blockstream, it would have to be an argument that Wladimir as the principle maintainer is. I don't recall him or Core as an organization ever trying to make anyone think anything. I recall about 4 outspoken devs trying to convince a lot of people of things on one side of the debate and 2 on the other. Core as an organization didn't do or endorse anything, these are just people pushing their own views. If those people also were all members of the catholic church would you be saying the Catholics are attacking bitcoin? The way Core is talked about on this sub is plain nonsense, disproved with even a glance at the repository."
"So you're saying he was a shitty programmer rather than a shitty human being? I fail to see how that's any more of a recommendation.

About the code argument, we'll see if it diverge and in a good way. That's my fear for BCH: that the programmers won't be able to keep up. 
Well the point is... The code that is 'present' in BCH is at a high degree the same as the one on BTC, at the moment. What was changed is a 'constant' (block size) and some code wasn't included. So, we'll see in the future if the programmers on BCH can evolve the protocol by themselves and diverge in a meaningful way VS copying code from the BTC repo. 
I don't disagree that the similarities bear investigation. Just want to be clear that the underlying mechanisms are different.
"Nooo haha. I thought you were correcting “shampooing”.

"You're absolutely right (and I've spent years trying to show bitcoiners this as well as the positive future implications)...but it is also true that neither bitcoin cash, nor any other cryptocurrency that I'm aware of, are very good stores of value...if only for the price volatility which means that we can't reliably or predictably retrieve value from the token at a future time.

Most all cryptos are currently: decent media of exchange, poor stores of value, and don't serve as unit-of-account, at all, for any significant economic sphere.

This makes the critiques and criticisms of economists about cryptocurrencies not being good currencies, valid....right now.

But it portends great potential future utility and qualitative change in the nature of the role that cryptocurrencies serve in the future, [if we understand how money forms on a market](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6u14b3/why_bitcoin_is_the_way_that_it_is_or_how_i).

It also gives us the more correct perspective on which side of the scaling debate to land on: when we understand the coordination problems, we properly prioritize on-chain payments utility as being fundamental to the process of bootstrapping a money into position as, not only medium of exchange, but good store of value, and ultimately, unit of account.

If the token does not become actualized money...we're just building an inefficient proxy currency for fiat.

TL;DR all three roles of money are somewhat complementary and self-reinforcing: you can't build a good ""store of value"" out of something like a crypto-token (which has little use-value except as a means of indirect exchange) without it also being a good medium of exchange."

You could develop at light-speed, it doesn't matter if you run in the wrong direction (not discussing about L2 here, but segwit-as-a-softfork  is a bad decision in terms of scaling, unless the intent wasn't to allow L1 to scale significantly...)

Take a guess.
Bitcoin Cash was created by Amaury Sechet together with the big blocker community. If anyone would write code to disable covert Asicboost on Bitcoin Cash then I'm sure that Jihan Wu would vote yes to activate that protocol rule change on Bitcoin Cash too. Note how no competing mining pools and no competing miners have ever complained about Asicboost. That's true both for Bitcoin and for Bitcoin Cash. The only ones complaining have been the small blockers who don't even mine. The effect Segwit has on the efficiency of Asicboost is [too small to matter in real life](https://youtu.be/By0w43NQdiY?t=20m42s).
Except that as BCH becomes more and more successful, which it is, you're seeing the code diverge further and further away. Things like graphene, adaptive blocksizes, and UTXO commitments are on the horizon. Don't expect to be able to make those claims for much longer. 
">as BCH will get 99% the same code as BTC. And some of those commits will be from GMaxwell. So that was my point.

Since segwit unlike his commit will be directly implementable (they will likely need some re-work) in BCH but I see your point."
"What do you mean 'successful'? Adoption? Code? Performance? 

For the original code on bch fork, we'll see I guess. I hope the programmers working on BCH are as good as the one that worked on btc (no major bugs so far)."
I didn't say 'all', I said 99%. That's my point... 
"Any similarity is outweighed by the actual definition.

">Ponzis guarantee a payout dummy. 

Yeah... No. Of course, I can't and won't argue with you infallible logic.

> You're in a highly sophisticated financial market.

When does the next ICO token launch?"
"To begin with, you can't store value in something that doesn't retain its value over time.

In order to retain value over time, it must have a somewhat constant price.

In order to have a somewhat constant price, there must be a supply and demand in rough equilibrium.

In order for supply and demand to be in rough equilibrium, there must be a primary demand driver that is _not_ the store of value, for if it is, the store of value will fail at such time when many people want to take out the utility from the store, or just when no more people want to store value. In other words, such a ""store of value"" will only function until all the world's people have stored their value, at which point it collapses.

Therefore, a commodity can never primarily be a store of value. It can only be a store of value as a _secondary_ function of a primary utility that drives demand.

This reasoning does not apply to gold for historical reasons. Thinking or saying it doesn't apply to somebody's favorite toy that isn't gold (as the people in Blockstream fork of bitcoin do) just because the reasoning doesn't apply to gold is a non-sequitur of epic proportions, because that ""somebody's toy"" doesn't have anything whatsoever in common with gold, particularly not its history."

I'm hoping the fork will give us an opportunity to move away from that blob of code. There are several design failures in there (that aren't directly related to Bitcoin protocol functionality) that need to be sorted out and haven't been. A clean reimplementation/refactoring that can be easily adapted to multiple forks and potentially other coins is overdue.
I understand the malleability fix is required for LN. So if BTC wants to scale through LN, it's definitely a priority since you need to get that done first.

"I don't subscribe to conspiracy theories.  I honestly believe that Greg Maxwell is doing what he believes is right.  And (without having ever met him) I believe that his behavior is actually far more moral than that of some other people on both sides of this debate.

As far as I can tell, Maxwell genuinely believes what he is doing is the right thing and best thing for Bitcoin.  I think that's irrational and that he's destroying Bitcoin, but I have never seen directly malicious behavior from Maxwell, nor any direct lies.  Not everyone who causes destruction is necessarily evil or malicious; conflict takes many forms."

Within 5 or even 10 blocks would be okay. It went through in the next block. The fee? $0.02! Can't believe something this low is possible. Thumbs up to BCH!"

Then you say that it's like he admitted that he hacked accounts.

On the other hand, if blockstream had succeeded with him as CTO, well some people forgive tons of terrible behavior and general idiocy if successful.

I bet you they'll try and ""make it their own"" in order to hide their stupidity in preventing the block size increase in the first place. Most likely they'll do it like a SegWit2x sort of thing rather than admit their entire plan was garbage and what BCH did was sensible."
Is that a joke? Please tell me it is.
That is a real concern I have right now. Maxwell hasn't withdrawn from Bitcoin development though. His influence there will remain. He's also surrounded himself with enough yesmen and driven away every opposing view for so long that I think the Core developers are so sick that even if you amputate the head the body shambles on spreading disease wherever it goes.
Then it still contains the Segwit and RBF poison.

"> /u/JustSomeBadAdvice [documents here](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7ktnth/thoughts/drhhpt4/) how Segwit2x was very popular until Greg Maxwell came out against it.

Segwit2x may have initially been very popular among the small blockers but among us big blockers it was very unpopular (unacceptable even) from the very beginning. We created Bitcoin Cash (BCH) long before (about 3 months before) it became obvious to everyone that the 2x part of Segwit2x would fail to become activated. Gregory Maxwell made a strategic mistake to champagne (pun intended) against the 2x part of the Segwit2x proposal, and maybe DCG / Blockstream are now punishing him for that mistake by letting him go from Blockstream."

"Full text of the resignation:

> Not really all that on-topic, but since it was suggested to me that this would be an efficient venue to reach others who might care to know: In order to spend more time working independently on deep protocol work, especially new cryptographic privacy and security technology for Bitcoin, I resigned from Blockstream last November. It took until the end of December to wind down my involvement there. Back when we founded the company I was concerned that there was significant underinvestment in Bitcoin technology: Bitcoin had a healthy technical community just as it does today, but lacked the kind of industry support that projects like Linux have. Without sustained financial support, some kinds of bigger projects seemed really hard to pull off with developers needing to share time between non-bitcoin employment, their families, and their other interests. For the most part, back then early Bitcoin companies weren't investing in public technology, at least not effectively. We hoped that Blockstream could help act as an anchor of support for technology development, and in doing so help grow the community. I think that has been a big success. The Bitcoin industry has matured a lot and today Bitcoin Core gets significant regular contributions from many organizations (including Chaincode, DCI, Blockstream, Coinbase, Bitmain, Blockchain, and probably others that I am forgetting or not even aware of) and a volunteer community much larger and more active than it has ever been before. From what I've been told Blockstream plans to continue to contribute to awesome technology in Bitcoin--as demonstrated by their Lightning webstore this week--but if they didn't, that wouldn't be a problem for Bitcoin. So for me this means that I can go back to working on the things I find most exciting ... without the overhead of managing staff or dealing with the many non-Bitcoin blockchain applications which are important to Blockstream's business. The maturing Bitcoin industry means I don't need to worry that Bitcoin development could be left with inadequate financial support. I'm very excited about all the new and interesting technology that is coming to production--Bulletproofs / CT, signature aggregation, improved propagation and synchronization--as well as the continuing maturation of Bitcoin as a viable subject matter for academic researchers. I'll be spending more time helping with these and other things, and will no longer have insight into Blockstream's activities or a Blockstream email address (I can continue to be reached at my xiph.org and gmail email addresses as I've used here in the past), but otherwise this shouldn't change anything for anyone here."
So it's getting to the time for them to slaughter the scapegoats and try to pretend they were on our side all along?
"I know why.

They will say he was against the block size increase but they never were against it, they will announce a very well ""planed"" hard fork to increase blocks to 8 MB, in the best Monty Python spirit lead by the King of Tabs."
"The November date is interesting. I have a hypothesis that may or may not have merit to it. Could it be that Greg was ousted by Blockstream investors after campaigning against Segwit2x, directly precipitating the unfolding disaster we have seen play out as BTC becomes unusable. All the major Bitcoin businesses, including Blockstream, are funded by the Digital Currency Group that brokered the Segwit2x agreement in the first place. All these businesses are struggling to deal with Segwit1x's high fees and congested blocks. Grayscale, the Bitcoin Investment Trust guys were forced by the terms of their listing on the stock market to choose either BCH or BTC to continue holding and liquidate the rest. This would have been less of an issue if the community could have prevented a schism and rallied around Segwit2x. Instead though the rejection of Segwit2x by Core has left the community fractured and leaves the possibility of a rally occurring around the technologically superior fork of Bitcoin (BCH). 

/u/JustSomeBadAdvice [documents here](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7ktnth/thoughts/drhhpt4/) how Segwit2x was very popular until Greg Maxwell came out against it. To me Segwit2x represented the absolute victory of one company in DCG's portfolio over every one else and that company was Blockstream. Possibly that could have resulted in a backlash from Blockstream investors who also invested in the broader Bitcoin ecosystem, and maybe that led to Greg Maxwell's ouster.

This is all just speculation on my part. Any number of other theories may be equally plausible or more plausible."
While he isn't anymore on the team, as founder, does he still own part of Blockstream?
u/nullc leaving blockstream is this month's Charlie sold all his litecoins. The captain has jumped ship.

Surely it's got absolutely fuckall to do with the iron-arsehole-rettentive control you people have over the repo, continuing to state that other clients are simply ""not bitcoin"", because the client you usurped would be reference implementation?

Worry not, now that BCH has forked off, we're starting to see the exact kind of industry support and research that you claim to have seeked for BTC."

I haven't seen anyone post this yet, but is it not possible this is simply a political move by Blockstream to avoid the obvious conflict of interest in having their top executives and founders being one and the same as the key BTC core developers with access to the BTC code repository?  It has always amazed me that more people are not concerned with what could definitely be a conflict of interest.  By GMax resigning from Blockstream, it could create the illusion of separation between the key core developers and Blockstream.

Yes, because Monero has a serious development team and is not a Bitcoin fork. Bitcoin Cash is just a fork and uses mostly Bitcoin code without having a comparable dev community.
I cannot wait. Competition is good. So far Bitcoin is significantly ahead with the protocol development stuff.
">BCH has for example already fixed the quadratic hashing problem in a different way without Segwit.

It's worth noting as well that BTC hasn't fixed quadratic hashing since only segwit transactions are protected and 90% of transactions are not using segwit. All BCH transactions do not have the quadratic hashing vulnerability."
"It's being naive because most people will ~~right~~ write a resignation letter like that no matter the real reason they quit.

Maxwell wrote he left Blockstream to work on Bitcoin.  Shouldn't he have had more power/influence on making Bitcoin better from his role within Blockstream?  Why would he have to leave?"
"Coinbase is just a company. They can scheme all they want. What do I care? As Bitcoin demonstrates repeatedly no company can dictate it's direction.

Roger is in BCH because he genuinely believes provably false things like that Bitcoin has been taken over, and all his experience in how business works shapes the way he thinks about Bitcoin adoption and potential failure. Wu is in it because there is a financial incentive for him to be in it.

It's also worth noting it is provable Bitcoin and BCH have been attacked by similar ""spam"" attacks, which you are right aren't really spam they are paid for. The reason it's considered hostile is that in both instances blocks are being filled by transactions with hundreds of tiny inputs and fees multiples greater than the total being transacted - i.e. transactions designed specifically to be large and expensive while accomplishing no real transfer of value. Kind of amazing there is a system where consuming available resources the way a DDoS attack might ends up reinforcing the security model through high fees without actually denying service.

The biggest issue with these conspiracy theories, primarily those here, is they ignore the only real information that can be used to draw conclusions - git history and onchain data. They would rather rely on convoluted social ""evidence"", often grossly misconstrued, to support their preconceived conspiracy while ignoring any hard public data which refutes them.

It might be true that there are lunatics in every camp, but Bitcoin shed more than a few with the creation of these forks."
"While your overall point is good, it should be borne in mind that BS is a small company and Maxwell is not just an exec but a large part of the main ""core"" of the company. Possibly akin to when Jobs left apple except Jobs actually brought some value."
Good bot!
Blockstream's somewhat unofficial business plan very likely depends on most people being forced to use LN / sidechains instead of being allowed to keep using Bitcoin on-chain directly (with low transaction fees). It doesn't matter if Blockstream invented LN or not and it doesn't matter how many or few direct LN developers they have in-house. They still built their business around LN / sidechains and are likely planning on becoming a first-mover advantage big LN hub that collects LN transaction fees that would otherwise have gone to the miners. Or maybe profiting from sidechain transaction fees somehow or in a similar manner.
The real world ruled by objective facts like observable contributions to open source projects as opposed to a world ruled by paranoia and absurd leaps of logic.

I wouldn't either.  But what else would you call a speculative asset with no value other than the promise of future riches?  
Segwit is not only about malleability. It also makes scripting language easier to update. But you're right – the main bottleneck is not Segwit but skillful devs willing to do stuff. And congrats for the current devs on fixing malleability a year after Bitcoin.

what's that?

I like bulletproof coffee!"
Monero does not have Segwit either and Bulletproofs are going to be implemented soon.
"There are other ways to fix the things that Segwit fixes. BCH has for example already fixed the quadratic hashing problem in a different way without Segwit. Segwit is a package of several protocol rule changes. BCH will fix the things that need fixing and improve the things that need improvement, on a case by case basis without such (unacceptable) rule changes as a 75 % signature discount ""included in the package""."
That was awesome! :)
No they got an additional $25M funding round at roughly the same time which implies that their investors kicked Greg out
You do know that BCH is taking most of its code from BTC right?
"What? You expect him to tell you the true? 

No wonder only idiots support Core"
"You clearly don't read r/Bitcoin. Coinbase is scheming against you. The only reason for high fees is people are ""spamming the blockchain"" even though that costs millions.

Segwit2x was an elaborate corporate conspiracy to destroy Bitcoin.

"Definitely an overstatement. As much as I dislike Blockstream, one executive resigning does not yet make a ""falling apart"".

"
The BTC blocksize will be increased at some point.  Almost everyone is in favor of that.  Most of the developers want to do it in a conservative way, with the real long term scaling being done through layered solutions.  I wish it would all happen faster, but both onchain and off chain scaling is a part of pretty much everyone's long term plan.

1. It is very fast as it has 0-conf, the fastest over the counter trade short a customer with exact change. 0-conf is even faster than the so-called lightening network which must make multiple interactive hops to a recipient. As the [median](https://www.swiftinstitute.org/sites/default/files/upload/The%20Statistics%20of%20Payments_v15%20-%20Chapter%2010%20How%20big%20is%20that%20payment.pdf) cash spend is just $15, 0-conf hands Bitcoin Cash a speed advantage over **all other cryptos**.

2. It always operates **uncongested by design**, even when it becomes the first [global currency](http://blog.vermorel.com/journal/2017/12/17/terabyte-blocks-for-bitcoin-cash.html), your TX will still get into the next block.

3. It has 10 minute block times necessary for **incredible scaling on-chain**. It has already proven on-chain scaling to 8MB blocks and can scale on-chain to 32MB blocks by simply relaxing a soft-limit. The Bitcoin Cash testnet has [mined](https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://news.bitcoin.com/gigablock-testnet-researchers-mine-the-worlds-first-1gb-block/&ved=0ahUKEwiwxZCYv7DYAhWCx7wKHfD1DJUQFgglMAA&usg=AOvVaw0lommjypr6e-N0LaD5-Qb7) 1 GB blocks demonstrating on-chain scaling to beyond visa levels, and this [study](http://blog.vermorel.com/journal/2017/12/17/terabyte-blocks-for-bitcoin-cash.html) examines on-chain scaling to blocks supporting 10 billion people x 50 TXs/day.

4. It has gained the coveted **network effect** advantage with the influx of merchants which has already begun to drive merchant acceptance. You can expect Bitcoin Cash to regain the dominant crypto position it held prior to the blockstream/core aberration. This is why, regardless of the features/capabilities of any altcoin (including Bitcoin Core), Bitcoin Cash can look forward to the greatest growth.

5. It is supported by a community that is bound by **vision and generosity** rather than censorship and deceit. It enjoys the high moral ground of ""a peer-to-peer electronic cash system"" as described in the whitepaper.



**Bitcoin Cash - designed to be the first global currency.**

Both BCH and BTC forked away from what used to be Bitcoin over the last 9y. BCH merely increased the blocksize while BTC added 4500 new LOC and changed 95 % of it to accommodate a brand new block format that gives a centralized 75% discount to SW tx's over regular tx's meant to drive users to centralized LN hubs that will siphon tx fees away from miners and put network security at risk.

So funny story... In college I used to work at the finance office. My job was to go through all the receipts and make sure students who were asking to be reimbursed through their official student group accounts weren't buying alcohol- policy was you HAD to submit the ITEMIZED physical receipt so you couldn't do returns. Obviously there were great inventive ways to get around this, but the admins were pretty keyed in to the most popular method: whoever buys booze for your party- just pay for their groceries via the student funds by submitting their grocery receipts until you have reimbursed them for the amount they spent. The one that I spotted was new though (didn't rat them out): a student group bought >$1000 in forever stamps, submitted the itemized physical recipe to us, and got reimbursed. But since they hold intrinsic value, you can return them... and get all that embezzled money back for booze. 
Surprised you take other methods!

LN incentives centralized nodes because you need a channel with big funds made to at least one someone, and the amount of connections that someone can make you is directly proporsional to his worth, so the more connections a node has the more convenient it is for you to connect to it, however as a node has more connections it requires ever more expensive hardware dedicated to it, making it so that big players can concentrate the most connections making the most out of the network, while small nodes would rarely get used, thus centralizing the network.

Not only that, LN has some weird perks, you can put money for 10 coffees in your channel with your favorite coffee shop, but then someone who has a channel with you pays the coffee shop 9 coffees and suddenly you only have money for 1 coffee on your node until you make two on-chain transactions to transfer money from one of your in chains to the coffee shop one. Not to mention that anyone can run a malicious node by simply spending all the money in his channel, closing it and double spending the coins, and if his transactions reach a miner before yours your money is gone for good."
Agree
Lol
"So the difference is that BTC is changing the core functionality of Bitcoin while BCH Is maintaining it, but somehow BCH Is the one that's not Bitcoin...

Look, I agree that some off-chain solution is needed, I even agree that Segwit should be implemented. But Lighting Network has a LOT of problems, and not only does not solve anything it incentives Bitcoin to create centralized hubs of payment, which is the very thing Bitcoin is supposed to be fighting. Also 8MB every 10 minutes is not the end of the world, your phone is able to handle that on 3G easily, and a 1TB HDD would last 2 years of filled blocks, when the price to make a transaction on 1MB block is so high you could literally buy enough storage for 2 years of 8MB blocks, you really need to reconsider if keeping that limit isn't a bad idea."
"They did, but botched the start.

There was not enough liquidity when they first enabled bch trading, which led to a massive price spike (something like 9000usd), a prompt crash, and swift removal of all bch trading pairs.

They now gradually enabled the bch pairs again, apparently with a bit more caution."
Yup, soon we'll break 1000USD! #WINNNNINNNNG!!!!
"do you realize r/btc is much older than 
1. BCH 
2. Your account"
"Welcome home.

/u/tippr $1"
Who cares? Hmm... How about anyone trying to buy BCH in Europe?
"> lol bch barely moved with the usd/bch pair.

You're right but you get downvoted bc they sub can't stand any comment that isn't shouting about ""the flippening"" or how ""core is doomed"". If you're not praising BCH or criticizing BTC, you'll get downvoted."
"This. Bitcoin Cash/Trash will die a slow death as it has been since it launched in coinbase in december. Since december Coinbase locked away my bitcoin trash and did not allow me to trade out of it. I was going to lick my wounds back then and trade out to better coins. Right now they are finally going to allow but the recent crash makes it too much of a loss to bear. Im hoping it will reach 2000 euros one day and then ill get out as fast as i can. Ill still be at a loss but not as great as it is if i withdrew now.

Bitcoin C/T/CRASH has been my only bad crypto-investement thus far. All my other altcoins rock...Its really annoying"
still quicker than the delivery of the so-called LightningNetwork
[Yes](https://www.quadrigacx.com/live/bch/cad)
Why not just use that?
"Just means people can buy BCH with EUR and sell BCH for EUR.
GDAX is Coinbase's backend exchange, so the relevance here is Europeans will be able to buy BCH with EUR on Coinbase, which means increased demand, which should put some upwards pressure on the price."
"QuadrigaCX and Coinbase allow you to buy BCH directly with CAD. There are other alternatives but for now you should be fine with those two. 

Edit: lol downvotes"
"Damn!

Any viable options for Europe?"
"Gottcha.

10 bits u/tippr"
Do you realize your response is completely irrelevant to my comment?
"u/ThisGoldAintFree, you've received `0.00054493 BCH ($1 USD)`!

"Yup, some sore losers in this place.
Their days are limited with LN being tested atm. All of a sudden they are starting to like LN and also want to implemented. What a bunch of clowns."
Great, we don't need weak hands who doesn't understand crypto or a whitepaper
Verification has a backlog of a few weeks. It is a toss up whether BCH/CAD will make it to GDAX faster than that. Though it'd be smart to start the process anyway.
Two reasons: 1) high fees and 2) low volume. You can't do anything besides going long, and it's unpredictable. It takes so long for the prices to adjust to the rest of the market, and believe me it doesn't work to the trader's advantage. 
Just remember you can sell on coinbase! But you can transfer.
I've been using kraken lately it's been painless so far

How do you think big blockers would've known in 2015 when this sub was formed,  what the ticker symbol for real Bitcoin be after the hf?
Bitcoin cash's technology is nothing special when compared to other coins . It's going to die a slow death. It will never reach the evaluation of the December peak. Never. The only reason it's high in market is because it's a stupid fork. Nothing else 
And this.
No. Check coinbase subreddit 
Yes they absolutely do
when your business is Bitcoin and BCH is the real Bitcoin...
Core said fuck you to every Bitcoin business in existence with their #NO2X campaign. The immediate response they should have expected was for these business to look for alternative business models that do not depend on Bitcoin Core. If they're surprised by this that's just their economic ignorance shining again.
This is good news! I hope they enable CAD trading pairs one day..
EUR to the moon
Oh yeah, using trump lingo, very trust inducing. 
Would be nice if coinbase just enabled BCH buying/selling in the UK. 
Every exchange without Tethers is good exchange
"It is amazing and unreal how BCH is being added to so many massive exchanges. So much FUD was created and many would have never dreamed we would get this far. 

Thanks coinbase!"
I'm good now that kraken is finally usable again. But still good news.
Cool. Easier to sell. Had them for awhile now
How is it now? Can I change my ETH to BCH on GDAX?
screw it...im gonna move some coins there just to help with liquidity 
Coinbase have a suspecious boner for BCH that smells really fishy. 
This is an attack on Bitcoin
Is Coinbase still safe for huge amounts of money? I’m thinking about it being a viable option to “cash out” someday.
so what would be alternative options as canadians other than quadriga
Why did it take them so long? Didn't it have this pair on the start?
Last I checked this isn’t /r/bch
lol bch barely moved with the usd/bch pair. Who cares
Nobody is going to buy btrash 
Finally I’ll be able to buy some. I’m excited!
Still no BCH uk buy on Coinbase though, can you still buy with a credit card from Bitcoin.com? Why is it taking so long?
Oh boy, BCash is #winning so damn hard right now.
"Alright so ""enabling BCH buys/sells in **early** January"" means the 24th of January. Good to know. At least they finally deliver! 
"
I hope this gets widely adopted someday
Does quadriga have BCH?
I hope I understand what trading pairs are one day..
do you have any way to buy BCH using CAD now? besides converting to another currency first
It's a great thing then that every bitcoin tx ccosts about one cent and get in the next block, you can bail so fast you'll have trouble getting out before the door slaps you on the ass, ha
May the #WINNING continue
you gonna be so sour my man
"5 months later.... people begin using it on main net. 

Yes - just a few at the moment, but even you must now admit - it is not 'pure vapourware' ;-)

Been running it on Testnet myself for a few weeks now. Works well. (I use the lnd client - but there are of course three to choose from, all compatible and conforming to the open source protocol).

"
Do you have a more exact ETA for releasing it? Is it within the next week? 2 weeks?
Crypto gets converted to Fiat instantly, merchant always gets settlement in INR. Also, we do hold a license from the RBI and will be operating under the regulatory framework.

"yeah that's what i said is it seems like you're trying to have a conversation with me

you're not accepting this feedback and you're looking for attention in the wrong ways"
and you can tell everything i say is bullshit because i'm clearly an SJW which is bad to be because who would want justice right
"Being a SJW is bad precisely because you don't want justice, you want privilege and to oppress others.

What you've been saying is bullshit because the contents of what you've said don't match reality."
do you know what kind of feedback you'd like
The truthful kind. Not the bullshit you've been spilling.
I think that Stark has finally figured out that she's going to be the one sacrificed as the scapegoat by Blockstream when LN fails to perform as advertised. For most people, she is the face of LN. BS has over-promised. It's almost certain that LL will under-deliver. Someone will have to take the blame.
"> The key difference in your strawman

From the [OED](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/straw_man):

>straw man

>NOUN

>An intentionally misrepresented proposition that is set up because it is easier to defeat than an opponent's real argument.

It's not a strawman because I didn't try to misrepresent anything. I asked if the same logic would apply to another well known open source project that has a lot of economic activity dependant on it."
the internet isn't a play fight game, get off it
What the fuck are you talking about?
are you having trouble finding more positive attention
Again, what the fuck are you talking about?
you know you don't have to respond right
"At least I'm trying to have a conversation; can't say the same about you."
You're not giving me any feedback, just insults.
Can we not pit ourselves against each other? This isnt necesarily directed at you but I believe that we can look forward to the future of both BCH and ETH. It's a bit ridiculous this conversation came up in the first place.
I own Eth, BTC, and BCH.  I'm not against either of them but I *am* against ignorant douchebags who spread false information and ignorance.
