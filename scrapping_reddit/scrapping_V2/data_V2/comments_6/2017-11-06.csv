Cool tech is cool tech.  Let us see where it goes.  Big block scaling needs creativity to mitigate the inherent centralising effects.  This kind of development may help.  It's good to see.
"Agreed. There's no resistance to hard fork in our parts and we can build this in wonderfully. And the Core resistance to it will prevent them from adopting beautiful and simple solutions like this one.

The protocol can designate a canonical ordering, for instance you could order them from smallest input to largest, and if a transaction is discovered that requires a previous input not found in that block, discard it for the next block."
"> I was told there would need to be a hard fork to establish this ordering. 

Why? If following a particular order makes their blocks faster to propagate, miners have a strong incentive to do so. They would only not follow it if they have a very good reason for, which they should be free to. There's no need to force the ordering on the protocol level.

"
"Yes, but a hardfork to set ordering as part of the consensus mechanism means we could predetermine the order of any set of transactions without sending any ordering data at all with the blocks.

Hard forks are great!"
"No offence, but I did not read it before.

Besides my idea offered is a bit more reliable than their bloom filters because my idea doesn't create any false positives. But I wouldn't call it my idea, I just applied general filesystem deduplication scheme to bitcoin blocks. Every block as one dedup record with ranges from sorted by fee and txid mempool. With bloom filter a false positive is possible, we would just sha256 the provided range of mem pool and compare it on every node. If node doesn't have the tx then it either waits or consumes txs until the hash and range matches. Range check is for protection against possible exhaustion attack (ie sending blocks with random hash, or sending blocks with random ranges and hashes). So block would include total number of included transactions, range of mempool and sha256 of that mempool range txs as if they would be in final block. As the mempool is ordered we can also create an auxilliary command in case of timeout to check the synchronicity of mempools. Something like range by range check of hash to find a missing transaction."

"I'd agree with you if you weren't right. Let me explain.

It can be made as a soft fork, but then you might have some nodes not updating and those nodes would then make those who are updated unable to use this propagation scheme.

You can even do this without forks altogether, by simply agreeing between the big miners that you'll use a specific transaction ordering and do it entirely voluntarily.

The difference between doing it in one of those ways and doing it as a hard fork which forces it on all of the nodes who voluntarily wish to remain participants, is that you can now safely make assumptions and base code on those assumptions.

There is alot to be said about knowing with certainty how the protocol works, and soft forks branches out the number of ways the system functions making it harder to optimize.

Would I want everything to be voluntary? yes, of course.
But what I'm trying to say is that even with hard forks that forces rule changes, it **IS** voluntary. Nodes **chooses** to participate after the changes by their own decision. (or they don't, in which case they're free to do whatever else they want instead)"

"> With a hard fork, we could make the ordering of transactions a part of the consensus rules, forcing 100% of all nodes to have identical ordering 

Hi, not an enemy, just a guy looking for a good discussion.

If you stop and think about the language you used, isn't a better way to say it

> With a hard fork, we would agree that the ordering of transactions are a part of the consensus rules, enabling 100% of all nodes to have identical ordering

The reason I say this, is that it's an important perspective change.

In a hard fork, end users voluntarily agree to alter their consensus rules to get the desired benefit. Nobody ""makes"" or ""forces"" anything - the network is permissionless with no authority to mandate change.

Once you look at it this way you see the subtle but extremely important aspect of a hard fork, and that is that it is always a noncoercive voluntary change made by the user who always has the choice not to go along.

Having said all that, wouldn't the proposed change be classified as soft fork since it makes previously valid blocks invalid under the new rules?"
"As long as everyone agrees on the order, a fork isn't needed; worse that can happen is some miners will have to fall back to the old system when someone makes a block with the ""wrong"" order."

I’m not sure who “we” is in this context. But I personally downvote things that contribute nothing to the conversation or reflect poorly on this community. 
"> by always putting TX1 before TX2.

I don't see that, I can see that you need ordering of transactions between  blocks but when the two transactions are in one block they don't need to be ordered by dependency do they? 

The miner already declared the combo valid, so a node can deduce it needs to do some extra reordering of the transactions *after* receiving the block."
You only need the ordering info on the few transactions that are dependent on other transactions. That shouldn't be too bad.
It is.
You can but you have to order them. It's why Bitcoin requires ordering information and there is no easy way (apart from perhaps mimblewimble aggregate signatures) to do without the ordering info.
I'm honestly not sure, but I'd be surprised if it was.
"Alright. That's a source as good as any for a definition I guess. Looking at the wikis change history, the first entry stated:

""A Hardfork is a change to the bitcoin protocol that requires all users upgrade.""

Which to me, is not only how I was introduced to term, but also the only sane definition. Might's well start using the terms ""TightFork and RelaxFork"" if the definition otherwise is so clear, no?"
"Oh come now, it is a figure of speech and you know that.

Most of the posts here don't contribute anything to any conversation on upgrading tech, so are you downvoting almost every post? There isn't much to talk about."
Doesn't quite work like that (I know what you mean though). Best you could do is serialise it so the child transaction is left out and put into the next block. Or send ordering info as well.
Can't the validation of transactions in a block simply look for the parent transactions in the block when doing the validation?
Wouldn't it make sense that if the transactions at the top are approved, then all child transactions of that, and all childs of those and so on, automatically also become valid, and therefore are ready to be in the block at the same time?
It is possible. And it should remain possible unless you want to introduce a big and unnecessary limitation. 
Sure it is. Why wouldn't it be? The dependent transaction can't be mined before the first transaction, but it can be mined with it.
"The problem is all changes to the Bitcoin protocol actually require the user to upgrade.

A hard fork explicitly requires the user to upgrade, because his client will reject the upgraded blocks.

A soft fork implicitly requires the user to upgrade because he's no longer validating upgraded blocks.  In this regard there is very little difference between a soft fork and a security exploit: the end user believes his client is validating blocks as usual, but in reality the client doesn't even understand the transactions and is happily declaring everything a-ok."
"You'll need to explain it more clearly to me I fear. To me it seems that inter block dependencies require proper ordering - that is the primary function of mining pools: imposing ordering (selecting) in the face of double spends (like RBF).

Intra-block though it is impossible to have double spends (a block containing a double spend  would be invalid *regardless of ordering*), therefor we can introduce a trivial canonical ordering inside the block even for transactions that would get sorted before a transaction it depends on (because a node can check for the absence of conflicting spends inside a single block *independent* of ordering)."
That may be technically possibly with a hard fork. I'd be interested to know if it breaks something else though (such as increasing the amount of time to validate a block)
That makes sense.
"If the client has no use for validating the upgraded changes, then this is not an issue. Imagine bitcoin softforks in a tightening change that solves malleability for those who need malleability solved; then users building on that could choose to only utilize those transactions without any significant downsides. So the assumption that all users have to upgrade either way is not quite true."
I was talked more about the soft fork. I think a hard fork doing this may work but now Im curious for the original reason for ensuring the child transactions are ordered after parents unless it is to allow a single pass verification instead of 2 pass (which would be required with a set order)
After reading it a bit more, it seems like a trivial increase in size even if the order is left out on a protocol level, the instructions sent for each node to reconstruct the most recent block from the mempool are already highly succinct as per the chart, it seems any additional parent/child flags could be included for a minimal increase in kB, seems more like a client level improvement.
"> Imagine bitcoin softforks in a tightening change that solves malleability for those who need malleability solved; then users building on that could choose to only utilize those transactions without any significant downsides. 

Yeah until they want to transact with someone who can't validate their transaction history...."
"I was assuming a hardfork possibility indeed...

I am not surprised about the current ordering requirement at all, that crept in by keeping the mental model regular :-)

"
"Indeed. Then again, as far as I understand bitcoin spenders was never supposed to have to validate any more than the structure of the recieving address; then send a signed transaction to the recepient who is then responsible for broadcasting it, and in that scenario he/she can simply refuse the transaction and not broadcast it, if it doesn't comply to the rules he has for the transaction."
"Can you point to where this is specified?
Ordering doesn't seem necessary to the technique at all.
Graphene just focuses on consolidating which transactions are in the block, ordering is done afterwards.
"
If that happened, I would be switching over to BCH.  It's this sort of development (and execution) that seems to have disappeared from Bitcoin. 
Is it not possible to have both the parent and child transactions in the same block?
"From what I understand, txid's are inherently unique, so no secondary factor would be needed.


Though, if there is some reasoning for using something that isn't guaranteed to be unique as the primary factor, and as any additional n-ary factor past that; txid's seem like the obvious choice for the tie-breaking factor."
">if a transaction is discovered that requires a previous input not found in that block, discard it for the next block.

This would be horrible. It would forbid people to move their money faster than once every 10 minutes.
"
Do you mean a transaction that needs an input that was not confirmed in a previous block? I think it's an important feature to be able to spend unconfirmed inputs as long as they are in the mempool. Maybe I misunderstood.
I believe the same. A bitcoin unlimited dev told me otherwise, maybe I misunderstood. It's in the other thread. Will quote later.
No, I like the idea of forking to add a canonical-order to the protocol to solve that.
"We are always interested in new contributors... PM me if you want to help out.  First, miners do include tx that have never been seen before.  So (like expedited) we would first modify your proposal to say ""send all the TX in the block that I didn't have, the range, and the tx hash).

But currently blocks don't have a canonical tx ordering.  So actually neither this proposal or graphene work (at the compression levels proposed).  But we could hard fork (on bitcoin cash) to a canonical ordering.  It makes sense to do so for other important reasons, like sharding the blockchain.  Basically,  the sort is a prefix trie of addresses in the transaction and wallets that want to shard just produce all addresses with the same prefix (like a vanity address). 

So we are quite a bit of work away from deploying the next generation block ""compression"" tech.  (note though that reportedly graphene can be deployed without canonical ordering to achieve a 2x compression)."

"> a hard fork which forces it on all of the nodes

you keep saying this

A hard fork by definition *relaxes* the rules.  It makes previously invalid blocks, valid.

This suggestion that transactions must be ordered a certain way in blocks is a tightening of rules.  It would make previously valid blocks invalid.  That's a soft fork by definition.

How did the world work before 2016?
Sounds like a better idea, sure.
With pretty much every large dataset, ordering uses more than just one factor. If the primary value being ordered by is identical, a secondary factor will be used to determine which comes first, if those values are identical, a tertiary factor will be used. And so on and so on. 
"You can still spend unconfirmed, what he refers to is the situation where the broadcasting of the parent and child transactions are non-uniform, meaning one miner could end up temporarily having the child but not the parent (while propagation is still underway). The proper solution for that one mining node then, would be to delay processing the child until the parent either is broadcasted to them so they can mine on the full solution, or to wait until a block with the parent comes along.

If the mining node discards it entirely since it's not valid (spending an output not yet existing) then it would be up to the wallet software to rebroadcast when it detects the parent in a block and the child still unconfirmed."
"Suppose someone sends in TX1 to X address then TX2 from X address to Y.

If you try to put TX2 in a block before TX1, that is a problem, as TX2 can't be spent until TX1 is in a block."
No hard fork (or soft fork) is required.
"With ordering it's much cheaper and basically limitless. Otherwise applying a compression method on the mem pool is possible but it won't be as effective.

In my case...

I'll read more on graphene. I'm not sure I'll be a great addition to the team as I'm not experienced in c++ at such level but in case of logical mind benders I'm all in to help. Actually I thought such basic CS algorithms are already implemented in bitcoin client. Now that you opened my eyes i see there's a lot of work possible to improve it more.

I see currently transactions are sent from address to address and blockchain grows due to that, i remember i read about blockchain snapshotting but i see no implementation of that. That would make it possible to keep only a few last blocks listing all final balances and timed transactions to actually hide all transfers and compress the blockchain completely. 

With blockchain snapshotting we could cut the size of reference client to few hundred megs. Create a structure and just reference the snapshots for transaction data. Should make the mem pool smaller"
You misunderstood the paper then. Graphene the protocol didn't specify how to handle ordering because it assumes a new (numerical) ordering of IDs within a block. 
"Thinking of soft/hard forks as a tightening/relaxing of the rules is something I've found weird for a very long time.

Sure, if we hard forked and changed PoW to Scrypt, previously invalid transactions (those hashed with scrypt on a sha256 network) would become **valid**, and you could call that a relaxation of the rules; but in fact it's just a change in ruleset.

If we **have** to put forks in relation to a tightening/relaxing scheme, then you have **THREE (3)** types of forks.

1) Soft fork: rules are tightened only 
2) Hard fork: rules are relaxed only
3) ???? fork: rules are both relaxed and tightened, such that the tightening (soft part of the fork) is enforced across the network due to the bundled relaxated part (the hard part of the fork).

This way of thinking however, just makes a mess in my head. To me, a hard fork is a fork in which users have to upgrade to keep participating, and a soft fork is a fork in which you may choose to not upgrade and still participate.

Also, might I humble ask, where can I read the definitions? (the literal definitions, and who stated them, by what authority and how well does those definitions fit reality)"
/u/pretenseofknowledge_ so we downvote memes now eh?
Black and white, paid for stuff with things called dollars. Constantly adjusting the v-hold was annoying, but at least all soundtracks were provided by a live orchestra.
"Right. The goal is to confirm TX1 and TX2 in the same block. You need a defined order of transactions that can deal with that by always putting TX1 before TX2.

Edit: Confirming TX1 and TX2 in one block is already standard. We cannot stop doing that for the sake of graphene."
"Indeed. Then again, as far as I understand bitcoin spenders was never supposed to have to validate any more than the structure of the recieving address; then send a signed transaction to the recepient who is then responsible for broadcasting it, and in that scenario he/she can simply refuse the transaction and not broadcast it, if it doesn't comply to the rules he has for the transaction."

Doesn't each node have slightly different copies of the mempool?
"Holy fuck i had that idea yesterday!

Thought to write a bip about that.

Lol. I thought we always receive blocks in format of txid in mempool but recently i found out that we receive full blocks. I was like ""wtf!? It's like sending a full file when you have most parts of it""

Wow.

Here's another idea then. Instead of sending the txids we can create an ordering algorithm which creates a hash for the mem pool matching instead of even transferring txids. Then worst case scenario you will need to download a graphene block, best case scenario just match transactions in the pool with a hash which is the only thing with offsets that is sent. It takes away the flexibility of picking and choosing which transactions get added to the block though. But it allows to sync blocks in infinite numbers of transactions"

"From r/bitcoin on Graphene...""It does not provide ordering of transactions in the block. Transaction ordering is important for CPFP (child pays for parent) where a transaction spends an earlier transaction within the same block, and pays the fees for both the parent transaction and itself.

"Well, not really.

While it does bring network traffic down and increases block propagation time, the blockchain itself is unchanged. Thus, storage demands still grows just as before.

The scaing measures ""storage requirement per transaction"" and ""energy per transaction"" are basically unaffected by this."

Yeah, requiring blocks to use a canonical ordering of transactions seems like a soft fork-type change. But I don’t even see why that’s required. Just specify a canonical ordering, and any blocks that don’t follow it simply won’t be able to enjoy the benefits (or maybe just the full benefits?) of graphene in terms of reduced propagation times / lower orphan risk.
people here seem agitated. 
Satoshi's paper says nothing about the p2p protocol
Oh no, core not gunna listen? Ok guys pack it up, nothing to see here!
With that attitude Bitcoin Core will eventually require more computing resources to move their 1 MB blocks than the rest of the node clients will require to move 1 GB blocks.
Too bad Core is working exclusively on Blockstream's altcoin. 
Core is about a week from being thrown out on their ass, fuck them
Why are you sorry for bringing good news?
That's fine. They don't have to. I'd even prefer it if they didn't. Whatever.
This is an amazing innovation. Your comment, on the other hand, goes beyond childish. Can we win on ideas, not words you picked up playing Overwatch, please?
Damn dude, I've seen trolls with better vote counts...
"It didn't come from Core....so it's shit

Edit - IT'S SARCASM PEOPLE...thought this would have been obvious."
I think you got that slightly wrong. 1/10th is when you don't need to send ordering information. For this to happen there needs to be a canonical order of the transactions that includes dependencies between unconfirmed transaction. I was told there would need to be a hard fork to establish this ordering. Since this is Bitcoin Cash I see no reason for that not to happen.
"I think a canonical ordering can be introduced by soft-fork:
the current rules require transactions to be ordered when they depend on each other, this creates a partial ordering on a couple of the transactions - we keep this rule. The (many) remaining ambiguities can be resolved by ordering the remainder by hash value, which would be a tightening of the rules - a soft fork.
"
How to send order info is another problem to solve.
yeah even i'm a little surprised that why wouldn't he consider ordering of the blocks which as far as i know is essential to make some transactions valid if not all. Maybe we don't need ordering of all the transactions but a few transactions and for the rest we could use canonical ordering. Can anyone more knowledgeable comment anything on this?
"Yes. But IBLT allows you to send the data proportional to the size of the difference of the mempool instead of the size of the block.

Roughly speaking the idea is this: I want to send you 1000 key/values. I know you already have 999 of those key/values, but not which 

I add all keys together, and all values together and send you SUM(keys), SUM(values). 

You then substract your 999 keys from SUM(keys) and 999 values from SUM(values); you then have the missing key/value and can construct the 1000 key/value block.

Now IBLT works like this, but instead of creating 1 such sum it creates *n* such sums and puts each key/value in some of those *n* depending on a hash. If *n* is more than the expected difference between you and me; you can reconstruct the  set in one round-trip"
"I can't say for sure but AFAIK every unconfirmed transaction is propagated to all nodes so they all have near identical mempool.
There are other issues that I thought about. If someone wants to add a new node he will have a lot of catching up to do. "
">Holy fuck i had that idea yesterday!

Lol it's been around for over a year. It's called xthin and it's available in Bitcoin Unlimited."
That is plausible. There are so many valid good ideas but core just wants lightning network to push their own interest. It's sad because most people don't even know how bitcoin works behind the scene so they have no say or opinion.
And xthin
This can be deployed alongside segwit so it's not an either/or situation.
Settle down, Anakin. 
"Indeed. Then again, as far as I understand bitcoin spenders was never supposed to have to validate any more than the structure of the recieving address; then send a signed transaction to the recepient who is then responsible for broadcasting it, and in that scenario he/she can simply refuse the transaction and not broadcast it, if it doesn't comply to the rules he has for the transaction."
Because they didn't realize/care that the name is already used by a competing blockchain tech.
TIL that Gregory Maxwell invented Adam Back. How modest.
I'm sure he'll think of some reason why it's actually dangerous, irrelevant, or a stolen idea from Core.

"
This guy fucks!
It does not matter if it works... BitCore devs will say that this technology is dangerous and they would like to keep the chain crippled and slow, because this is the only way Blockstream can make money from sidechains..
It works on 1MB as well, altough the gains scale with blocksize, so on small blocks the implementation costs and ordering management might in itself be prohibitive. Unless hard fork, in which the cost is a one-time downpayment.
Yes the important question. Hopefully someone can answer this. 
Graphene is the name of the toolkit bitshares and steem are built with.
No. It doesn't change the blockchain format.
Yes and No. It would require a hard fork to do safely and consistently as it relies on being able to order the transactions in the same way on both peers. Without a hard fork, the peers have to agree on an ordering scheme, or transmit the ordering of the transactions. With a hard fork, we could make the ordering of transactions a part of the consensus rules, forcing 100% of all nodes to have identical ordering and thus enable them to safely leverage this new technology.
"This requires a hardfork to establish a canonical order. Will Core hardfork?

Nope."
No. The similarity exists only in names.
Same thought here.

Weird name yeah. Doesn't even make you think of transmitting transactions more quickly.
If a change in protocol produces substantial benefits it should be adopted regardless.

I'm glad you see it like this. Now do so. There are no ""but's"". Just show them that they are wrong through scaling then. It's very easy to do.

"
">You realize that they bash us too, right?

Yes - both places are toxic.

/r/bitcoin is the worst, but that doesn't mean /r/btc is good. It just means /r/btc is less bad than /r/bitcoin. 

I'm telling you to not attack. Be the better man\coin. I don't think the attacks does anything good except create a toxic place. It won't correct anything. Core will be Core. They control the Bitcoin code. They are super villains in disguise, but it doesn't matter. As long as we own Bitcoin we accept their actions.

It is really interesting to see you trying to make your actions about my lack of heart. It's just a damn coin. Some money. Why do you care so much? How have you managed to make some peoples vision of a product into an attack on you as a person? You should calibrate your priorities in life. Your anger is like that of a child. Are these the actions of a level-headed adult in your opinion?

Don't forget that I was fed the same lies as you. I am not an outsider. I mainly post in /r/btc as well, but I am getting tired of the bitter people spreading toxic propaganda instead of trying to build a good community that can make a better tomorrow. 

Trumpesque victimization really isn't the way to go.

The statistics of the frontpage shows us 44 % of posts here is crap. They do not add any value anywhere. Those posts will not make Core close their code factory. It will not make Blockstream stop taking bankers money. It will not make people stop buying Bitcoin - hell, most of you own Bitcoin it seems as well. The toxic crap is only pushing good people away from this place and it adds fuel to the fire of hate that burns inside you and many others like you. Why do we want a community that is fueled by hate? It makes no sense. 

Just to clarify something: I do not dislike you. I do not dislike the big block chants you come with. I dislike the Core hate you spew. 

So to answer your question about ""*Literally, what the fuck have we done wrong!?*

You've started an attack that is only taking out civilians instead of the intended target. And you've kept firing. The civilians... the new people to this war... they've said what they thing about your behavior. It is in Top:All in this sub. 

Start by selling your Bitcoins or something. It is no longer the product you bought and want. You'll sleep better at night. The greed for HODLing on to them really takes away a few points from your victimization."
"> I mean threads bashing things Core has been doing and saying why it is bad.

You realize that they bash us too, right? And you realize who started this whole thing, don't you? It was not us. 

And you realize they have a censored echo chamber where they bash us all day and do it in such a way that we can not even defend ourselves because they have banned us from replying? How can you not see who the bad guy really is here?

Why don't you take a second to realize that you are rubbing salt in the wound of the people who have already been pretty badly screwed over. Realize that every single thing you say about us, is what you SHOULD be saying about our opponents. We are not the attackers, we are the ones that are being attacked. 

So what you are doing is kicking us while we are down, rubbing salt in the wound, lemon juice in the cut. The wound is the fact that propagandists have very unethically and unfairly taken over the narrative and are pushing lies and misinformation. They are misleading people to cover up the truth about scaling Bitcoin so they can convince everyone that we need to use their shitty L2's, which they know are inferior to on chain transactions. That's why Ben davenport admits here that if we raise the block size people won't use LN:

https://twitter.com/bendavenport/status/831319684632846336

So it is very clear to see that people have infiltrated Bitcoin and are purposefully preventing scaling to create demand for a product they are trying to sell. They're lying to people, using misinformation and propaganda to cover up the truth about scaling. It is 100% unethical, 100% wrong, completely fucked up in every way and maddening as hell. 


And you're rubbing salt in the wound to make it worse. Have you no heart at all? 


WE are the victim here...and look at you...you are blaming US, for the thing that is being done, TO US. So take a second to stop and realize who is TRULY doing the wrongdoing here. It is not us and we do not deserve these false accusations you are levying against us. 

We are not the ones censoring. We are not the ones doing propaganda and manipulation. We are not banning people with different opinions. All we are doing is spreading the truth, we are victim to what has been done to us. So when you come here and accuse us of doing propaganda, when you come here and say WE bash Core, you are 100% projecting. We are just trying to help dispel misinformation that is being perpetuated and help people understand Bitcoin from a different perspective. 

> Why on earth would you be part of something you so strongly dislike?

Look - I'm really not sure how you think it's fair for big blockers to NOT say something about this. Do you not realize that we had a successful project that was working great for the first 7 years until people came along and tried to change it and now it doesn't work that well? Honestly, can you not see this?

And now they have almost completely destroyed the value proposition...so we forked and made new Bitcoin with the right rules, and we are educating people about what happened. **Literally, what the fuck have we done wrong!?** Are you saying that if YOU had invested into a project and someone came along 7 years later drastically trying to change it with propaganda and manipulation, making it less useful than before, that YOU would not also be upset? 

So I'm not sure what you're getting at here. And honestly I am really mystified by the fact that you are still able to see me and big blockers as the bad guy. You should really take some time to think about who the bad guys are in this equation. I am certain that if you take some time to think about this from an unbiased perspective you will clearly see that we are the victims and not the attackers.  
"
"> /r/bitcoin is the worst

I'm glad we are starting to agree. 

>Be the better man\coin.

Please...explain to me how you think this is NOT what we are already doing. 

What did we do...We left and created our own subreddit. Then, we left and created our own coin, WITH replay protection...Don't you see how proper and unimposing that was? We gave up the brand name, added replay protection etc. So we were as respectful as we could possibly have been...to the guys that are fucking us over. Please, think about this for a second...We did everything right, they STILL attack and bash us and you STILL are here rubbing salt in the wound. It seems there is no way for Big Blockers to win here. I promise you that the more you think about this the more you will see this is so wrong in so many ways. We are 100% the victims here. 

Now all we are doing is helping spread the good word of the original value proposition. Nothing wrong here. Literally...**none of this behavior is unethical in any way.** 

>I dislike the Core hate you spew.

Let's think about how fucked up this is for a minute. 

You are mad at US for hating core. But you aren't mad at core for what they have done to us? What the hell man... CORE is obviously the one doing the wrongdoing with their smearing, manipulation and straight up lies. You think we want that!? No...we hate this... We are simply responding by speaking out against this and educating people on the truth. And you hate US for this!? Goddamn man...that is some seriously twisted shit...

This is what's called ""victim shaming."" Kind of like how an attorney for a rapist in court will attack and shame the victim. So fucked up. 

Obviously the optimal situation for us would be one that we did not have to talk about Core at all. But because of the situation **they** created, we are now the subject of much hatred and ill will (like yours) and not only that, we are left to defend against an INSANE amount of lies told to the public about the technological limitations of scaling in chain. You think we want this?... I would love for Core to stop spreading lies and attacking us because then we could actually move on without having to defend against misinformation and attack. 

So your Ill-will toward us is completely unfounded. I encourage you to spend some time thinking about this issue from a neutral perspective so that you can see how horribly we are being treated and for absolutely no good reason.
"
"> Um...You mean about BTC?

I mean threads bashing things Core has been doing and saying why it is bad.

If you got to /r/btc/top/ you'll see the third most upvoted post saying [Both /r/btc and /r/bitcoin are terrible subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/78a1t9/both_rbtc_and_rbitcoin_are_terrible_subreddits/). It came 13 days ago. It has 1500~ upvotes. There's not enough bots to make that happen artificially.

The second most upvoted post is about how /r/btc and /r/bitcoin view each other. And the most upvoted post of all time is about transaction fees on the Core-chain. It came 4 months ago, so around the time Bitcoin Cash came out.

> I am a part of it.

Then my question is: Why on earth would you be part of something you so strongly dislike? It's going all to hell according to you. Sell now before it's too late. It's a broken chain not aligned with God-Emperor Satoshis view. It's literally unusable due to Core's implementation. Now realize that Blockstream is helping their cause - so sell out ASAP."
"> I'm glad you see it like this. Now do so. There are no ""but's"". Just show them that they are wrong through scaling then. It's very easy to do.

No, it is not easy...don't you see what they have done? They have hijacked all the relevant communication channels and banned us all from talking there. So it's actually pretty fucking hard. 

That and they control a massive troll army dedicated to spreading misinformation and lies. And they spread these lies in places that are censored so we can not even begin to refute it. 

So again, your ill-will toward us is completely unfounded. The way you're talking to me, your victim shaming, your generally negative view of big blockers, it is all completely ridiculous and 100% unfounded. So please stop. 
"
Little do you realize it is **you** spewing hate right now. 
I think we're digressing here. Please, just think about the things I've said. 
"No - you're just playing the victim here. You have not given any rational reason as to why you spew hate, no willingness to stop it, and no willingness to build a good community. 

You should do the thinking."
"> 11/25 posts on the frontpage right now is about the Core-chain.

Um...You mean about BTC? That's pretty fucking relevant to the discussion. Don't you think? By the way, one snap shot at one point in time is not enough data to support your claim anyway.

>If you really care so much about something you are not a part of

That's the thing. I am a part of it. I own coins on both forks and have been in Bitcoin since late 2012 when I started mining. Not sure why you are talking to me like this. Core propaganda has been affecting me very strongly in a very negative way, for years now. Am I wrong for reacting? Of course not. 

> Our enemy is not Blockstream. Our enemy is fiat.

Except Blockstream is attempting to take away most of the utility that made Bitcoin great with their unethical roadmap of restricting block size to push people onto L2. So their actions are supportive of the establishment that you understand IS the enemy. (seems like we agree on who the enemy is. Now realize that Blockstream is helping their cause.) 
"
That depends. Are you?
How about since we both know there is no reason to hate each other we both just agree not to.
Just answer my question.
Your victimization will not get you anywhere. It'll probably feel better when you fail - to blame it all on everyone but yourself, but if you follow a coin that dies then it never had the right to live anyway.
"> Most posts are about BCH nowadays especially with all the positive news, etc. So just stop being unfair, please.

You are doing your propaganda again: 11/25 posts on the frontpage right now is about the Core-chain. That's 11 more than needed.

> How should we be reacting?

If you really care so much about something you are not a part of then there should be other causes that are more important. Go to wikileaks for a list of actual terrible things going on in the world you could spread awareness on.

As for what you should be doing about Core? Nothing. Ignore them. Build Bitcoin Cash instead. Talk to the Bitcoin Cash developers - whoever they may be - talk to businesses about why they should accept Bitcoin Cash.

Don't peg me for someone who doesn't see the issues with Blockstream and Core. I am fully aware. But either they will go bankrupt because of their choices, or they must have done something right and live on. To believe bankers won't be involved in crypto currencies at some point is ignorant. Bankers will go where the money is. They will go into Bitcoin Cash when that takes off as well.

Our enemy is not Blockstream. Our enemy is fiat."
I am highly convinced there are more effective and ethical solutions to a better world than the toxic slander propaganda that I see you and others create here in /r/btc. I don't actually believe you when you say that's your goal though, but if I believe or not is really irrelevant in this matter. 
"What is troubling me is the effort you and your fellowman put into bashing /r/bitcoin and Core is wasted energy that could be spent making /r/btc a vibrant community and Bitcoin Cash a fantastic coin. The toxicity is all basically related to Core-bashing. 

We all know Core sucks so why spend time on them when there is interesting debates to be had about the development of Bitcoin Cash for example? Core is not going to stop development of their coin and if you do not believe in their vision then I expect you to not invest in their coin, right?  It's not like we see the same constant pressure targeted at Litecoin for example.

And if you don't like them, aren't invested in them then why discuss them at all? Just beat them with a better product."
"Precisely. ""Especially of a biased or misleading nature.""

That is the exact definition I was going on as well. The reason why I do not believe the big block ""narrative"" fits that description is because there is nothing misleading about anything big blockers say. All we do is explain how Bitcoin is supposed to work, using sources like the white paper as citation. In case you have not noticed, a nasty corporation has come along (late to the game) trying to rewrite history but we are fighting that tooth and nail. So there is nothing dishonest going on, **on our end.**

And sure, Big Blockers make mistakes and there are a lot of trolls on here too, or people that are just straight up wrong. 

If I had to quantify though, I would estimate the amount of misinformation being perpetuated on r/bitcoin is greater than 10x what is perpetuated here. Furthermore I would point out that any misinformation perpetuated here is much more likely to be attributed to honest mistakes, while in r/bitcoin it is likely to be attributed to pure malice and ill intent. 

So, I'm down to debate and share my understanding with people, but when you're debating with me atleast, can you do me the justice of keeping the misleading statements to a minimum? And if one Sub is clearly guilty of something, can you please not project that onto the sub that is mostly innocent? Thanks. "
"I haven't been called a troll here before as far as I can remember as I usually don't give baseless accusations. This is not the first time you and me have a discussion, and your name pops up often enough around here. 

The definition usually used about propaganda is ""*information, especially of a biased or misleading nature, used to promote a political cause or point of view.*""

I would say it isn't a requirement to be misleading as long as it is biased. Which it is. Everyone who is invested in Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash has an economic incentive in this. And to think that there isn't the occasional post here that isn't misleading while pushing a political agenda is absurd. Remember, there is no censorship here, and people have an economic incentive to lie.

I do not disagree that /r/bitcoin is a bad place. But this isn't a choice between a good and a bad sub. It's a choice between a bad and a bad place. I prefer /r/btc, but it's just as toxic as /r/bitcoin. The problem is that /r/bitcoin is much worse at censorship. 

Both subs can absolutely be toxic. Why you seem to believe otherwise makes no sense to me."
"Let me tell you something. If you have ever been called a troll in here, this is why. 

When you say ""toxic slander and propaganda"" you are precisely describing what goes on in r/bitcoin, now remember the reason for the existence of this sub is **because** of this toxic slander and propaganda. We were all getting banned and deleted so we made this sub to talk about Bitcoin and any relevant forks. This sub is our way of having a voice where previously our voices had been deleted.

Very little, if anything at all, that we say on here can be defined as ""propaganda."" If you look up the definition of propaganda you will find it does not match what goes on here. We advertise, yes, we push satoshi's vision, we support the original Bitcoin and the original plan of scaling on chain. But the definition of propaganda requires being ""misleading."" Nothing we say here is misleading. We may have a different opinion than you, but we do not mislead people. 

It is r/bitcoin that misleads people. Telling users they all need to run nodes and that we must hold back scaling for it. Telling users hard forks are dangerous and you can lose all your coins (lie.) Telling people Bitcoin is not supposed to be a currency, only a store of value even though the white paper says ""cash"" in the title. r/bitcoin is the home of toxic smearing and dragons den propaganda that has ran so many of us away from that sub. Anyone can see it. 

So what you are doing is projecting. r/bitcoin is CLEARLY, CLEARLY the toxic propaganda sub, and this one is CLEARLY, CLEARLY NOT. We are here to get away from the behavior you describe. Notice how we tolerate trolling and do not ban trolls? So you are just way out of line with this accusations, nobody is listening to that crap. 

So stop projecting the inadequacies of r/bitcoin onto here. You're not fooling anyone, if anything you are just proving to all of us in the loop here that you are a complete troll. "
Uh, no, alts can also crash and never recover. I wouldn't take financial advice from people dealing in absolutes. The first part I agree with though 
I don't think I am spewing hate. And neither should you because there is no reason to. 
"The reason this subreddit exists is explained in this article: https://medium.com/@johnblocke/a-brief-and-incomplete-history-of-censorship-in-r-bitcoin-c85a290fe43. There is a lot of things you have not seen or heard if you spent your time at rbitcoin. The discussion here at rbtc is uncensored (modlogs are public), but that also requires you to filter through the material / comments with your own critical filter at work.

I couldn't find a synopsis of BTC/BCH/S1X/S2X but it is continually discussed here, so if you stay around for a while you will find this information. You might be met with some hostility if you present the arguments around scaling from rbitcoin as truths here, but as long as you ask questions of curiosity and show willingness to understand the divide, you will be warmly welcomed.

See you around!"
Here is  bitcoin.com's (Roger Ver's) take on the chains: https://www.bitcoin.com/info/bitcoin-cash-is-bitcoin
"You're doing the same thing still. Blaming us when it is our opponent who is clearly in the wrong and brushing our opponent's wrongdoing under the rug. 

First of all, stop mischaracterizing how much time we spend talking about Core. Most posts are about BCH nowadays especially with all the positive news, etc. So just stop being unfair, please. 

Next ask yourself this. How **should** we be reacting? You know that Core is perpetuating propaganda, misinformation, straight up lies etc. You know that many of us have been banned from r/bitcoin completely after spending years earning karma there. You know that The bitcointalk.org forums, the Bitcoin mailing list, many Bitcoin facebook groups and many less relevant Bitcoin subs are heavily censored, even by the same people. You know they are brushing the truth about scaling under the rug, deleting quotes from Satoshi, pushing a narrative against scaling on chain and FOR their corporate L2 solutions. **This is just wrong, on every level, just so unethical in every way.**

Honestly, with all of this, how do you expect us to NOT say something about what is going on? Like, really...you think we should just roll over and let them perpetuate misinformation and ruin what could be the greatest invention of our lives? Fuck off. We are going to speak out against this and we 100% SHOULD. You need to take a long look in the mirror and think about who is really doing the wrong-doing here, if you can really think about this from an unbiased perspective you will see we are the victims completely. 

The truth is coming out though. I'm sure you can see it. My advice to you is to get on the right side of history before the tides turn. Stop bashing us for trying to help people see the truth. Stop being upset at us for exposing BScore lies and manipulation. Be upset at the people who are actually doing wrong, which is not us. "

There you have it folks, bcashers are flat earthers. This is your community. Lol.
Gamers typically have an above average computer. Were talking about scaling to everyone in the world. How many steam users do you think live on 2$/day?
One can ask that about BTC segwit 1. It's not even technically Bitcoin anymore, whereas BCH is and was hard forked off the original chain. The most technically correct one should be Bitcoin, and segwit 1 isn't that.
So they have to put their trust in you, or whoever is running that $20,000 node? How is that any better than trusting a bank.
Can you do me a favor and price out how that works on 2$ a day?

That's your opinion, and you're welcome to it.  Other people disagree.

> #Conclusion
> We have given a structure for a lightning network with 10 million users which has no centralized hubs

You also (conveniently) seem to forget that this came about from the Bitmain ""UAHF"" plan, which includes:

> We will also push for and encourage changes in code, in main block or in extension block, that will make Lightning Network run more safely and reliably than Core’s present version of SegWit does.

> We will encourage and help various multi-layer solutions come into production. 

> At the same time, RootStock, co-founded by the inventor of Lumino, is also trying to implement Lumino on RootStock. Lumino will work perfectly with Lightning Network.

Also, an unrelated quote as people round here hate the ""filthy"" soft fork implementation of SegWit:

> The original Bitcoin NG is a hard fork proposal, but we can soft fork it into the protocol with the extension block framework.

It's all smoke and mirrors.

They aren’t trusting the node. They are trusting the software running on that node and 10,000,000 others like it all over the world. 
"Sure thing.  You may have heard that Segwit-enabled Bitcoin is being reengineered as a ""settlement layer"" for Lightning Network.  In this new vision of Bitcoin, *if it ever works,* users will hold Bitcoin not in wallets whose keys they exclusively control, but in ""Lightning channels,"" which I and others who have looked into Lightning network believe will organize into a ""hub and spoke"" network architecture.  So funds will be routed through ""lightning hubs"" between end-users, breaking the ""P2P cash"" model of onchain bitcoin."
try using bitcoins in your business day in and day out, and you'll see quickly.  On some days it cost $10+ to do a transaction and it takes 4-20 hours to confirm.
"I read quite a bit on these subs and can't say I've ever heard of Craig calling for a ""centralized ledger"", nor Roger arguing that full nodes were bad for bitcoin.  Could you provide sources?  Also, on what basis do you claim that graphene weakens the peer to peer concept?"
Scaling isn’t the only issue at play. BitFury did a study that bitcoin with 8mb blocks would force 85% of nodes to shut down in 6months, then you run into a centralization issue. Which is a bigger issue in crypto ideology: decentralization or fees? The market has already answered the question for us.
I thought the whole idea of this thing was for decentralization instead of the other way around?
"Decentralization isn't an all or nothing affair. If it were and you prioritized decentralization above all else, believing that every person on the planet should be running a node, then one factor to consider is using the least amount of bandwidth as possible. This would mean you would restrict blocks to something like 270bytes (0.00027MB) which is one basic transaction and an IP header. This is obviously retarded for anyone that wants to use the network.  


Add in this basic fact: Lightning requires larger blocks to function. It's in the Lightning whitepaper. It requires 133MB blocks for 7 billion people to each open/close **one channel per year**.  


The Core dev's refusal to increase the block size and cause Bitcoin to repeatedly fork was pure incompetence.

SPV wallets would be fine for 99% of users.

It seems you misunderstand all of this."
"Simpletroll; Bitcoin finally has an 8MB upgrade. Can I have your coins please? 1MFK7i7CGwXu3jWCagiGdvv5GXdi9NDmt5"
It's technically feasible. Whether practical or not is another question. The thing with segwit coin is that it's totally impossible for that scenario.
According to you.  I remember when side chains were all the hype in late 2013 right before the blocksize debate started to heat up.  I'm just making the point that there have always been people on both sides of the debate.  It's not a debate between newcomers and latecomers like you say.
"If the hub is down, your money is not accessible to you. With layer 1 Bitcoin, your money is always available to use, as long as you have an internet connection. Having the ability to lock up someones funds is what I would call ""control""."
yes
You price out how transacting on a network with a $5 fee per transaction works on $2 a day. 
It's dirt cheap to print a paper wallet?
Doesn't seem like a very good scaling solution then IMO
I just love big blocks :] 
"/u/tippr gild
"
Just curious, what does the blocksize have to be in order to have parity with VISA if this is the scaling solution?
People need to forget about running bitcoin on the pc they inherited from their nan which has a hdd measured in GB and runs Windows ME
"The study in question is [here](http://bitfury.com/content/5-white-papers-research/block-size-1.1.1.pdf) and it’s not terrible. What it is, is out-of-date.

The Bitfury paper identified RAM as the biggest bottleneck for onchain scaling, and they figured that a home user node would need around four times as much RAM as the blocksize. They based their estimates of current node capacity from Steam’s user survey. 

However, if you check out [the latest Steam survey results](http://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/?platform=pc) from last month, you can see that over 80% of hypothetical nodes now have at least 8GB of RAM, with a quarter having “12GB or higher”.

So the impact of increased blocksizes today would be a lot less than in 2015 when Bitfury wrote their paper. Almost like computational capacity is still rapidly advancing and smart technologies should make use of that capacity increasing trend."
"> ""I and others who have looked into Lightning network believe will organize into a ""hub and spoke"" network""

That's pure FUD.
I and others who have looked into Lightning network know that lightning hubs can not control the network. Anyone can route around any hub.
Your narrative is flawed."
Side chains have nothing to do with the scaling debate. Sidechains are still cool and can be implemented with or without the Blockstream stagnation team who really just want to them for collect fees anyway. 
"I'm glad you are concerned, since I think the peer-to-peer aspect of Bitcoin is very important.

> Lightning Network .. will organize into a ""hub and spoke"" network .. breaking the ""P2P cash"" model of onchain bitcoin

So I get it you think that a future development of Bitcoin may be less of a peer-to-peer-system than a future development of Bitcoin Cash.

I wonder about Bitcoin Cash, though: there are many voices claiming, that the peer-to-peer-system of Bitcoin is no longer necessary: Craig speaks of a centralized ledger ""Paypal 2.0"". Roger was for quite a while explaining that full-nodes are harmful for Bitcoin and should be replaced by central systems. And if I read the comments well even Gavin's (and others) recent technical improvement proposal for the block propagation is basically *weakening* of the peer-to-peer concept.

I helluva can't see advantages of BCH here. Would like to, though ...



"
"> BCH is much closer to the original ""**Peer-to-Peer** Electronic Cash System"" 

Could I ask you to explicate the advantages of BCH in particular for the ""Peer-to-Peer"" aspect of Bitcoin?"
To elaborate on that further lightning hubs will be centralized and LN transactions are not based on proof of work, meaning most of the properties that made Bitcoin great to begin with such as immutability, irreversibility, decentralization, etc. will be degraded severely or completely lost.
Weighing in, fully agree. 
"I would agree with you, with one additional statement: Bitcoin Cash is not _against_ second layer solutions, if done properly. I actually believe they are probably necessary for the long-term*. But Bitcoin Cash to me is not about on-chain scaling vs two-layer scaling. It's about not limiting the blocksize to 1mb, avoiding segwit, changing the horrible leadership, and maintaining the original vision for Bitcoin (cheap, censorship resistant money for everyone).

*I know, I know, some people disagree about this. I am aware of the arguments."
"Agreeing as a frequent on r/bitcoin 2013-2015 and bitcoin user since 2012. (/u/PsyRev)

And honestly, OP, you left a lot of things out. This block restriction bullshit is a coordinated attack on bitcoin and is not a difference in vision."

Not if there is a $10 transaction fee required to confirm on chain.
"Thanks, I am fully aware that there is lots of propaganda that says LN is a viable, decentralized scaling solution. The truth about that, is that it is not:

"> BitFury did a study that bitcoin with 8mb blocks would force 85% of nodes to shut down in 6months

Yes, but this is either

1. Baloney, or

2. 85% of nodes are pathetically inadequate to support the world's future reserve currency

I'm pretty sure the answer is #1 ;-)  Even supporting 32MB blocks isn't a huge cost for even a small business."
"Is that a question?

r/btc constantly claims bch is usable by the vast population living on 2$/day. How do you expect them to even acquire the paper wallet? It’s not like these people have a free library down the block."
Agreed.
You can always send transactions on-chain. Nobody is forcing you to use 2nd layers.
"I heard it's in gigabytes


Edit: I heard wrong"
"Bitfury’s paper - the one that you cited without linking - worked on the assumption that gamers and Bitcoin enthusiasts would have comparable equipment. 

When we’re talking about scaling to everyone in the world we don’t need to talk about everyone in the world running a full node. That would be absolutely idiotic. 

There isn’t any level at which impoverished 3rd world subsistence farmers are going to run a full node. They don’t need to and they certainly wouldn’t waste what little money they have just so they can be the 6 billionth full node on the network."
Yeah they can still use it. All you need to use it is a wallet. 
Username not checking out....
"> bitcoin cash is often toted as usable by people who live on 2$ a day...

Yeah, that's right. What's the problem?

Would you link the study for the sake of scrutiny please? An important thing to keep in mind too, in the case of it being a possibility that may happen, is what do those nodes mean to the network? Are they full mining nodes?"
"""... did a study ...""  Where is the link to that study?"
Then that study is horsecrap.  Believe it at your own risk. 8MB blocks are here and now.
"I have a powerful intel PC and terabytes of storage. I don't run a full node, just a wallet. I could run that wallet on a smartphone if need be. Not everyone has to be a full node to use the system, and computing power and especially storage space is in freefall cost-wise. 

60 TB 3.5 inch SSD:s exist now. Yes, they cost huge amounts of money - now. That won't be the case for very many years to come, and 60 TB drives won't be necessary anyway. 

To say nothing of the cloud. I haven't really looked into it, but there is nothing that says you couldn't farm stuff out to AWS or what have you.

Centralization is a matter of definition. If by that you mean ""fewer nodes"" then perhaps, but fewer nodes can't mess with the function the way a clear middleman or hub (in theory) can."
"Big blocker or small blocker, can we stop quoting Craig as if he is any kind of authority. He's a scammer who had his 15 minutes of fame over a year ago.

Even most big blockers think he's a fraudulent hack, if we ignore him he'll go away."
"Is the ""atmosphere""(let's just call it air shall we) stuck to the ground? Obviously not because even a 5-year old can move it around easily with his hand. So it's not stuck, so how can it follow the supposed spin of the ball?

It has to be completely stuck because we're supposed to be spinning 460 meters per second right now(at the equator).

So since it's not being held to the ground and it's therefore not ""gravity"" that's holding it down, can you explain to me why a gas would perfectly follow along a ball? Note that it has to be completely perfect as completely calm days on earth is an everyday occurrence.

...

We know it's not ""gravity"", we know that air doesn't follow around balls that spin."

How do they know that based on a hypothetical study? 
That was a nice demonstration on your part!!!
Should have said maximum privacy and security, cause you still have some of both without running your own node. 
Can any proof of work (POW) crypto-currency ever achieve the kind of transaction rates required for a mass adoption?  Proponents of proof of stake (POS) claim that POW can never achieve those kind of transaction rates and only POS can do it at a level exceeding what Visa and Mastercard are doing today. For example the EOS (EOS.io) team claims that they will achieve a transaction rate of millions-per-second (on chain).  No one seems to be talking about an increase in transaction rate of more than a few orders of magnitude in a POW system.
That is simply not true. 
I could have sent at least 60 BCH transactions for the fee you paid on one transaction.
Lol get fucked then... can't say that Americans didn't bring that on themselves 
Only way to have true privacy and security is to run your own full node. 
"They are not binary things, they are on a sliding scale. Running a full node may be marginally more private than using SPV but it provides little value to the user as the increase in utility is negated by the cost. That is why Satoshi explains here that users running nodes is not the intended configuration for scale:

https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=532.msg6306#msg6306
"
">  If I were processing 8mb blocks I would be over my data cap and have to pay 50 extra per month for unlimited. This is the problem with larger blocks and centralization.

Think about how ridiculous you sound. You are asking us to hold back scaling so you can run your useless non-mining node...."
The cost per transaction of POW drops as you do more transactions.
Well, think about it from a HODLer's perspective: the ability to transact Bitcoin means that someone might be able to steal your Bitcoin. Whereas a clogged chain means that you will always own your Bitcoin - a coin you can't transact is a coin you can't steal.
"There's really no reason to restrict things to consumer hardware. Satoshi always said the network would be major institutions and data centers, so we can go much, much higher than people are comfortable talking about in the fudmosphere created by Core. 

Besides, PoS just boils down to PoW in a different form. Any claims that a system can defy the iron law that ""work (of whatever form) rises to meet available coin subsidy"" are just marketing hype. Any scaling anyone can do securely Bitcoin can do securely. Even in a spinoff id necessary. The value is in the moneyness, which is in the ledger being THE ledger, meaning you buy into the ledger and you never have to worry about losing your stake. Switching to different ledgers (altcoins) destroys the whole original point of sound money. "
Yeah, I agree. That wasn't what I was saying.
