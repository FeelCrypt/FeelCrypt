What do you see wrong with it? I'm mostly against ICOs myself in terms of labeling shitcoins. Otherwise, I think any other altcoin should be a welcomed addition with it's own niche. Bigger blocks is certainly a niche worth exploring.
No it does not seem odd to me. Not to say I agree with the move, but for the r/bitcoin strategy of pushing the brand as a distinct, separate, entity from any other crypto, including forks, it seems pretty par for the course. They are protecting the brand - it is clear they are trying to maintain control of anything with bitcoin in the name. The oddest piece to me is the OP using the name CobraTheymos. I think the only purpose this serves is misinformation, which seems inappropriate to me for someone seemingly trying to contribute to the community.

This is actually a perfectly normal thing to do, and if the op didnt want to get pinged by admins and get all mad about it, all he would have had to do was make one post every 3 months to avoid it.

Visit the /r/bitcoinforks subreddit.  Then, check out /r/redditrequest .  Reddit Request is the subreddit to apply for ownership of another community under the conditions that the existing mod team has gone AWOL (typically defined as several months completely inactive, and ignoring all PMs).  

/r/bitcoinforks.  There's about 2 posts in total, across the past 10 months.  It is as dead as a ghost town.  This is the type of thing /r/redditrequest is designed for, to commandeer an inactive sub after the mods may have left reddit entirely. I'm not surprised someone wanted to claim it (**CITATION NEEDED**).  OP doesn't care to share a screenshot or a post in /r/redditrequest or disclose how the admins notified him of the 'hostile takeover'?  We don't even have proof that someone tried to take it, just his word.

Honestly, people just need to think for themselves.  /r/bitcoinforks looks like a low-effort set-and-forget abandoned sub.  Any asshole can message the admins and request mod permissions over a dead sub."
Shh, don't ruin the agenda! 
Look into it, the information is public knowledge and widely known. Yes, the subreddits, domains, and telegram sites I mentioned in the OP are centralized by a single group. 
">Is that true?

Can't say, without any screenshot or proof.  But reddit does have an established protocol for anyone to put in a request for mod for a dead & inactive subreddit.  Check out /r/redditrequest , basically if the entire mod team of a subreddit is completely inactive for a couple months and doesn't answer PMs, then the reddit admins will give control of the subreddit to the first person who asks (after an application and review).  /r/bitcoinforks certainly looks completely dead & inactive, with the lone mod having made just 1 post in the last 5 months, so I wouldn't be surprised if an admin was doing a wellness-checkup on behalf of someone else asking for that good domain name."

I totally agree with the censorship, I just find it very hypocrite to say especially in this subreddit which is all about taking over, especially with biased mods that are hatespeeching all the time. Like this guy who moderates three Bitcoin Cash subreddits:

>There are rumors going around that S&D is actually the massive troll WhalePanda. I wouldn’t be surprised if it is. Also, MoneyTrigz is a scammer. It seems all these scammers run together

Don't you agree that this BTC vs BCH argument does not solve any problems?

It seems like either you're doing this for publicity at this point (congratulations you've tripled your number of posts in that sub), or you're stirring up shit in order to further your own agenda. There is already enough of a divide in the community, I wish we could cut back on posts intended to stir up animosity between crypto users.
Bro just be careful... Sub incoming tho
Thanks. Will be adding more depth to the page in the near future. 
They have to hide that there is a theoretical yet fundamental way to cheat the block chain that could be built by a state actor with today's technology. 
What the hell does r/CryptoCurrency have to do with this?
Could the /r/btc mods counterattack? Request the reddit mods to take /r/Bitcoin because of the repeated violations of reddit's sitewide rules?
"> I am here to tell you these cultists will not take my forum without a fight

I really like your word choice here because that is what we are up against.  I think it might go deeper.  Freemasons, spy agencies, and slime creatures of that nature.  Control over the monetary system is the most powerful weapon on earth and they want it."
Thats how they operate. Keep fighting against the banksters!
Thanks for sharing this! 
Subscribed. Looking forward to contributing.

I'm in no way an expert, but excuse my humble opinion, the fight that's happening is silly, on both sides you can see that r/btc is openly promoting bch and bashing btc which it's using its handle, and its natural that they fight back, thing is both sides are immoral and both sides doesn't care about anything but monetary gain.... If it were up the real community, the millions upon millions of crypto users, both sides will lose control over their subs and domains, but sadly it's the internet and this silly fight is forced down  all our throats
[AXA/Bilderberg and the CIA](https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7d02ee/some_thoughts_about_the_possible_bitcoin_segwit/) just won't quit, they will do anything they can to block the stream of information, [hire sockpuppets](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/mar/17/us-spy-operation-social-networks), and keep the sheep in line and ignorant.  They can have the mindless sheep though, and the independent thinkers and people who actually matter can join our team and fight for Liberty and Satoshi's vision. I think we are winning, despite their skill at painting things a certain way with their sockpuppet shill accounts and overtaken chat fora. /u/tippr gild

Thanks, just edited.
It's not your forum, its the communities forum. Attitude like this is why Reddit is in this shit to begin with. Same with trade marks.

Missed the opportunity for a SAD pun. 
I kind of read it as /r/bitcoinpitchforks
Stop whining, everyone!
It must be obvious by now that Theymos , Maxwell etc are clearly the names of Troll farms. No individual would have the time or even be bothered to do this much work to control and sensor this many forums.

Nah. StopAndDecrypt is not WhalePanda - just to clear that up. Completely different knowledge bases. They are also both active Twitter users.

"Plenty of people on r/btc are very, and perhaps more, concerned about mass adoption of market-driven financial systems, especially for the unbanked billions in the world, than 'muh gains'.  So your claim is false there.
However,  if you can arrange a swap between r/bitcoin and r/btc, I think a lot of people here would listen attentively."
"Ah yes. Both sides are still the same, after all. One could commit egregious crimes, but when the other points them out, they have both committed violations thus the severity no longer matters. Who cares if I shot his sister - he stepped on my toes.

This is why America is the lauging stock of the earth, and this is why Bitcoin is the laughing stock of money. False equivalences only serve those in the wrong."
"I think the difference is that r/btc itself is not promoting anything. It's some people that post there promoting BCH, who might've otherwise posted on r/bitcoin had discussion of the BCH fork and on-chain scaling been allowed there.  

Why does r/bitcoin see such a threat posed by on-chain scaling and bitcoin forks that they won't even allow discussion? Censorship implies weakness. If Core had the stronger argument they should be more than happy to debate on the strength of their ideas, not outright silencing of differing views."
"> by force    
> for $100,000

These two are mutually exclusive ."
BCASH aka Roger's coin is the perfect example of a shitcoin. :)
Is that true? So one source dictates the news on the market. How can anyone think that is good for their money? Subbed because I hold both BTC and BCH and I'm sick of the bullshit I'll support you 
"If the above post is posted in:

* r\bitcoin - it would be deleted within minutes and OP banned
* r\btc - the accused mods have to resort to responding ""roger the scammer!"" LOL"
Ethereum and Monero are important open blockchains, for example. Credits is something irrelevant. Maybe even not a chain, just a token
"^^ secretly stacking Bitcoin Cash

Its obivous he is neither of them
Redditor /u/cryptodirky has low karma in this subreddit.
I agree a little bit that some things are silly. But when development started to get monopolized, when people started realizing how one specific mod has a lot of power by wielding a monopoly on forums and domains such as Bitcointalk, the bitcoin wiki, bitcoin.org, and r/bitcoin. When you see these things an individual should question the integrity of what is happening. The split may not have happened if monopolies were squashed immediately but instead the majority has let them thrive. The BCH side of the argument is mere blowback and I think it should be much louder. I think concentration need to be more focused on all the tentacles involved too rather than just Blockstream. There is corporate money that is a conflict of interest at the heart of what bitcoin was meant to be from MIT's DCI, Chain Code, and Blockstream. Maybe people need to follow these monopolies more closely and see where they derive. Social media and forums there are huge red flags stemming from a group that controls many forums and domains. Development same thing. I agree fighting is silly. Exposing blatant fraudulence is needed and that's why I spoke up today.   
"Thanks, but they aren't going to believe you.

When the mods of this subreddit continuously push inane propaganda and everyone follows along, you know there's an issue.

It's called a request for a reason.

The sub was completely dead, the owner/OP commented a handful of times on Reddit prior.

Let's be real and stop playing games, they pretend like this is their main account but it's clear that it's not, and the admins just need to take one look to figure that out.

The sub only has laughable activity now because they finally logged back in to their alt and came across the situation.

Congrats, /u/CobraTheymos, you're active again, keep the sub. It's not that big of a deal."
But they both work for the same branch of the CIA.
Since you're making a claim, care to back it up?
"> this subreddit which is all about taking over

No. This subreddit is for people *refusing* the takeover, and insisting on following Bitcoin's original design philosophy.

> especially with biased mods that are hatespeeching all the time. 

https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3h9cq4/its_time_for_a_break_about_the_recent_mess/

>This will probably be downvoted to infinity - no censorship right?

This post was at -2 when I read and replied to it, which fully demonstrates that downvotes are not censorship."
We aren't after the same goals. Blockstream wants to make money by keeping BTC regressive. BCH is trying to create satoshis vision of a decentralized currency .
This was at -15 when I read and replied to it. Downvotes are not censorship. Get that through your thick skull.
why do you? 
Subbed.  Fuck those guys.  This kind of bullshit bullying is fundamentally the same sort of bullshit decentralization is made to combat.  Some small powerful cabal subverting the will of the masses for the enrichment of the few?  We cannot stand for this.
How come you haven't made any posts into your own subreddit except for 10 hours ago?
Yeah, S&D already controls (and badly maintains)  /r/BitcoinAirdrops.
It is even worse than I thought.
The Theymos account used to be owned (and might still be owned) by a guy with the initials MM (contact me for full name information) who worked in a government position at the capitol building in Wisconsin with one of the congressmen. His connections to government agents might be closer than anyone else in the space.
but both apear to repear the same lies
There's far too much money on stake and free open source software projects never had to encounter such a huge resistance before. How does FOSS supposed to deal with corporations worth billions which operate efficiently for a well defined goal with a clear years long plan?
"The sub was pretty inactive though.


There are clear reddit rules for sub takeovers. Mod inactivity is one of them. "
Fuck those cats.
So you don't think it's odd the bitcoin mods are trying to take the sub? Why not just let it stay dormant?
r/cryptocurrency moderation has changed hands over the past seven months. This is clear as day. It is highly suspected that r/bitcoin mods now have control over the r/cryptocurrency subreddit. Coincidently around that same time r/bitcoin mods tried to claim r/bitcoinforks multiple times. IMO over the past six to seven months the monopoly has been trying to acquire every single domain and forum they can squat on so they can control the conversation. They have a lot of control already and the fact that my tiny sub was a threat shows a lot to how weak their arguments are. 
Thanks.

Imo threads like this should be stickied for a while, it is important to properly expose these malicious tactics by the Core people.
This comes up under almost every major /r/announcements post, but it seems they don't find /r/bitcoin is violating their ToS.

"Why would an r/bitcoin mod try to take it over? Especially ones who are so critical of forks. S&D is a BTC maximalist, and him taking it over would be and should be called ""squatting,"" because he wouldn't give any respect to the concept of forks. No. In reality, my small and tiny subreddit is a threat to their monopoly and they tried to take over like all monopolies do. Just like r/btc is threat to their monopoly.  "

  You should read about a new project - HelloGold foundation. They are aiming at the creation of the fund that will be supporting new startups in the sphere of financial usage of blockchain technologies.  It is important, because the access to financial services for the unbanked and underserved is essential to any meaningful attempt at reducing poverty and empowering the poorest within developing nations. The HelloGold Foundation will support key initiatives aiming in this direction. And, if you join their channels HelloGold and Airdrops.io on Telegram and Twitter you will receive 150 HGT tokens  (\~$2 USD).

I think he's trolling
I think he's trolling 
One of the old mods said so. Seems like sub may have been taken over.
Hard to know if this is true, or if it was a hostile takeover by r/Bitcoin mods. They tried to takeover another one at about the same time this happened.
