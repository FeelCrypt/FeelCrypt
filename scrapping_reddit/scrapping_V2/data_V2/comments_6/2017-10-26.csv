Segwit is a joke, not a blocksize increase.
Segwit transactions would be cheaper than traditional, but the whole price structure would rise - to the extent that people stick around to use it.

"> If that's true, why would Maxwell be in favor of the witness discount for segwit transactions? Your whole argument is based on the incorrect assumption that they want on-chain transactions to be more expensive.

There are two reasons for Maxwell to favour the witness discount.

1. It allowed SegWit to be pitched as a scaling solution rather than just a major change to transaction format. Scaling was/is desperately needed by the whole community. The other effects of SegWit are mostly just useful to people building off-chain/2nd layer “stuff” - like Blockstream.

2. The capacity added by SegWit only benefits signature heavy transactions. I.e. most simple peer-to-peer transactions will end up paying more per-byte than the complex settlement transactions that - *again* - Blockstream needs to make its offchain stuff work."

Sidechains *benefit* from a crippled Bitcoin mainnet. And because successful adoption of sidechains will increase the value of the Blockstream company's equity, people like Greg Maxwell, who've acquired equity in Blockstream, have the express financial incentive to cripple Bitcoin mainnet in order to profit.

It pains me to see lead developers of a project with unnecessary COIs like this. No one in that position deserves to be spared of criticism. It also needs to be said sidechain tech is cryptocurrency-agnostic, meaning if constraining Bitcoin mainnet turns out badly for Blockstream/Core, they can just move their technology to a different coin after burning down this one."

"Sadly history is replete with this type of rent seeking and it's arguably the number one problem we face as a society. The typical story goes like this.

Company X cannot compete openly in the free market so they conceive of some government regulation that will benefit them at the expense of their competitors. But you can't just go around saying ""pass this regulation so that we can increase our profits at the expense of other people"". So what do they do? They find some way of spinning it such that the regulation is really for the ""public good' or for ""consumer protection"" or ""consumer safety"".

The brilliance of this strategy is they are able to convert extremely gullible but otherwise well intentioned people to their cause of fattening their profits. Average people start calling their congressman demanding this regulation. Rallies are held. Activists flood the communication channels with support ... All for the private benefit of special interest. 

This is how we got the Fed in the first place. The public was told this was a consumer protection measure meanwhile the President of the First National Bank of Chicago, James Forgan, was holding meetings where he tells the bankers, ""The purpose of this meeting is to discuss winning the banking community over to government control, directed by the bankers, for their own ends"" (actual quote).

We've seen the same thing play out in the Bitcoin community sadly, but I'd actually be surprised if it worked long term in this case because, unlike regulation, the blocksize isn't mandatory. People are free to use something else. And ultimately we'd expect competition to prevail."

According to some research, the projection of one's unconscious qualities onto others is a common process in everyday life.

"> Blockstream plans to cripple the Bitcoin blockchain at 1MB to push users off chain

Segwit was a block size increase (2.3MB in practice, potential max of 4MB). So, uh, you were wrong.

Also,  [the scaling roadmap](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-December/011865.html) contains an additional block size increase. Just not till after other scaling solutions are tested and implemented. So again, wrong.

And blockstream does not control bitcoin development just because they employ a couple of the [90+ active contributors](https://bitcoin.org/en/release/v0.15.0.1). That's just conspiracy theory nonsense. Development and the decisions made are decentralized, like they should be, unlike 2x which is just one guy as far as I can tell.

"If that's true, why would Maxwell be in favor of the witness discount for segwit transactions? Your whole argument is based on the incorrect assumption that they want on-chain transactions to be more expensive.

Sidechains exist to allow the transfer of value to different blockchains with different rules. Making on-chain transactions cheaper would not make a sidechain less useful.

"Well I've been to India. The infrastructure is up to handling bigger blocks. It's behind, but it's not 1980's behind. It's the same story in many countries the US would call 'third world'. There is no need for every user to run a full node in any case. A modem from the 1980's would be perfectly capable of handling millions of dollars a day in transactions if there is a SPV client at the end, and there would be no increased chance of that client losing funds because of it.

Stenography is not relevant to bitcoin. It's not a reasonable way to transfer a constant stream of data and it can be detected by entropy checking lower order bits.

> Please respond to my argument of small blocks in the context of censorship resistance.

A larger block size makes no difference to censorship resistance except by enhancing it. You seem to be implying a 64MB chunk of data would be somehow easier to censor than a 1MB block but that's just not true. Both sizes are absolutely tiny compared to all the cat videos, email, and web traffic going over the internet. You should understand that any kind of data can be tunnelled over any kind of channel. 64MB of data every ten minutes can easily be sent by DSL, cable modem, long range wifi, mobile networks including those installed in third world countries, or pretty much any kind of network it's possible to build with modern equipment.

The only way small blocks affect censorship is by causing the self-censorship of everyone that gets priced out of the whole system by higher transaction fees. If you charge more than the banks do you have already priced out everyone except those that can't use banks.

Unlike an unregulated ICO they cannot simply put their money into whatever investment. Unless it was clearly stated in their VC contracts that some of their funds would be put into bitcoin then they could easily be serving years in prison for misappropriation of funds.

And there, you'd be wrong.

*Given that this is true, it is easy to discern methods by which software developers can begin to extract revenue from the system: second layer systems such as Lightning Network propose to lock potentially large amounts of economic activity and liquidity outside of the blockchain in favor of non-PoW settlement systems which then rely on the PoW security to prevent counterfeiting. There is also an opportunity for potentially large amounts of block space to be “leased” by the developers: In such a scenario the developer produces a software which allows them to prioritize certain transaction channels for a contracted buyer, this allows the software provider to consume space in the block for a discounted rate and pocket the difference. In this process the miners are continually starved of fees, an increasingly unstable scenario as block rewards continue to decrease over time.*

*This will inevitably lead to miner’s margins being squeezed to the point of directly increasing centralization as only the most competitive miners will be able to derive any profit. This can quickly turn into a losing scenario and in the ongoing hashrate drop you find an opportunity to simply layer all of the secondary solutions over a low-security blockchain such as a proprietary algorithm operating on a central service whereby the computational security is trusted not by the highest difficulty chain, but simply the chain “owned” by the provider which may now be truncated, editable, and considered to be private property.*

*For reference: If the software provider is charging as much as possible for block space, and paying the miner as little as possible, eventually profitability for both will reach an artificial equilibrium. With users forced to access the blockchain via the software provider, the space available in blocks and the fee costs associated can be adjusted at will, ensuring minimum fees for the miner and no variability in competition. Compare this to an open fee market where supply and demand are forced to intersect organically and overwhelming demand for block space will drive up miner profitability insisting that the equilibrium of supply (cheap transactions) and demand (fees/block) be a moving target.*

Currently Blockstream has that consensus and not Craig Wright, Jihan or Ver. And if BTC crashes (don't see how a company would want to crash something that generates money for them, but let's assume the crash it) there are alternatives that isn't controlled by companies that purposely want to crash it, makes no sense but you guys seem to think so, so I need to type in a manner of respecting your insight in company-driven economics.

Because even though you have different opinions than myself, I still think that would not be right. I don’t like limits placed on anyone or anything...however as I already said, there’s only one limit I’m convinced has been put in place, and it’s not on you.

"It's still orders if magnitude better than completely centralized LN and corporate side-chains.

And constant time doesn't matter if most Ethereum blocks are faster than 1 min.

"I think you're projecting a lot of your own insecurities into anything I've said.

BCH is going nowhere.  It is an Alt but it has utility.  In time, it will gain value as it is used.

Blockstream is not the free market just like Apple putting people in jail for jailbreaking their iPhones is not free market.

I'm not worried about B2X, Core, blockstream, etc.  It will all sort out in the end.

Blockstream will kill BTC itself with its desire to tax the system.  People will find that they can make transactions for pennies on the dollar - so why pay Adam a tax for something that was and still is supposed to be free save for miner tax.

I don't need to make any effort to do anything.  I'll ride the BTC train until blockstream taxes it to death and then I'll ride the next train."
"> Yes, but it is still a complicated way to do it compared to on-chain scaling

On-chain scaling _doesn't do this_. Liquid is complicated compared to a lot of things that don't do what it does.

> Regarding privacy, cool, but something that can wait

Do you work for NSA by any chance? People needing to broadcast every financial transaction they make is an extremely serious society-threatening problem.

> Right now Bitcoin has hit a wall in terms of usability and hence it is hurting adoption big time. The window of oppertunity for mainstream adoption is closing fast.

Because people are quickly finding ways to transact without being surveilled and censored? Then the world must be a much better place than I thought. This is reason for celebration.

> Blockstreams solutions do not solve any of the immidiate (or even most important) problems right now.

The people paying for Liquid evidently disagree with this.

> So, why are they so against on-chain scaling then?

Can you find any Blockstreamer on record as being against on-chain scaling? (You could argue Luke is against it, and you could argue he's a Blockstreamer, ok.) It's weird then that the company's only full-time Core developer was also one of the primary inventors and implementors of Segwit if this were something they were against."
"> For instance, a post over there telling someone to read this subs messages would be near instantaneously be censored and deleted. The person making it would almost surely be banned.

Precisely the type of conspiracy theories I was talking about ;-)

>And look, here you only have 1 downvote and your comment remains for all to see. Looks like people aren’t even wasting the time to hit the down arrow, which is what should happen to low quality posts such as yours so that they don’t annoy others too much...

As for this place, I have been flagged as an ""anti-big-blocker"" or something, and can only post once in 10min. It's sufficiently frustrating that I cannot hold a decent conversation, especially if there's many posts I have to reply to.

Not really banning, but it basically achieves the same... Except that it allows people like you to claim ""Look, you're not banned! We're so cool... r-bitcoin is shit!"". Which is precisely the type of negativity I was talking above. 

Inadvertently, you just confirmed what I described. On two accounts.

"Lol! Ethereum doesn't have CT and [hardforks randomly with days' notice](https://twitter.com/lopp/status/918173838332055552) and requires [an insane amount of hardware to validate](https://anduck.net/bitcoincore_vs_geth_full_node_stats.png) without any decent privacy tech (in fact significantly _worse_ privacy than Bitcoin because of their account model), their addresses have no checksums, all the blocks are mined by EF-influnced miners and anyway the EF will hardfork the chain to reassign funds if they don't like the way money's flowing.

Also blocks were recently slowing way down because of their difficulty bomb. That was a couple weeks ago, I understand they hardforked a couple times since then, so maybe they've sped up?
"
Blockstream is using the free market and all good and bad tricks to achieve their goal (to kill Bitcoin or whatever you think they're up to), still this is how things work in the real world, if you don't compete enough someone else will. Currently Blockstream is competing with all their power and all you do is to point and cry instead of doing just like the do, get up on your feet and use the free market and free competition and bring Blockstream down, make a product that's better than theirs and the crowd will follow! If Bitcoin cash is better than Bitcoin segwit it will without doubt take down Bitcoin segwit and if you're crying about censorship and think that's the problem why BCH is trading for 1/20 of the BTC price you aren't working hard enough, you need to put in more effort into making your idea prioritized by the crowd instead of crying that someone else is rigging the game, there's always a bigger fish, be the big fish or big fish eat you while you cry for being to small get anywhere in the real world where competition is tough and cheap tricks are being used, because they are winners they don't care about loosing they care about winning and it's working!

Oh wow, thank you! I’ll be a bit more weary of r/bitcoin from now on and direct any questions I have to this sub.
"I understand. Here, read this series of posts by singularity87:

https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/6rxw7k/informative_btc_vs_bch_articles/dl8v4lp/

Second, if you have time, read this:

These are both very good write-ups.  After reading them you will be pretty well informed. They will catch you up to speed.

Then make your own opinion on the subject."
There is also a follow-up for that second link: https://medium.com/@johnblocke/r-bitcoin-censorship-revisited-58d5b1bdcd64
"yeah i was thinking on this. https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/48xwfq/blockstream_founder_and_ceo_austin_hills_first/

You can have all of that with Ethereum, for example. There will be variance in the blocks, but they average 14 seconds, way under a minute.
Which also helps “liquid” the other major project they are betting big on 
"N. Korea, Iran, all the despots claim ""democracy"" because everyone gets a vote.  Only one problem, there is only one candidate to vote for.

On r/bitcoin, if all dissension is dissected, you don't have freedom or a free market.  You have a manipulated market.  That is also known as crony capitalism."
Cryptocurrencies are a perfect design when it comes to free market and free competition, with almost 1000 altcoins in a handful of years. No one can say that crytocurrencies are blocking competition!
Ah, I see.
Indeed I will, I will tweet it when I get home :D Not that I have a large twitter following or anything but its better than not sharing.
Also, Blockstream has patents in sidechains.
"They were not ""glaring and obvious"" because they made no sense. When I tried to pull apart the original post's ""blockstream needs 1Mb can't handle 2Mb except thru Segwit"" conspiracy theory I got shit on and downvoted, why would I bother with the followup?"
"Yes, ""some specific things"" like fast and reliable confirmations or transaction privacy. Real niche use-cases."
"My post has no assumptions, it cites several specific benefits of sidechains, including Liquid, which have absolutely nothing to do with the blocksize.

I'm beginning to suspect that this sub is not interested in facts or logic."
ah yes, spelling. stupid fingers
"My only suggestion, keep reading both, and make up your own mind. 

You'll get a lot of conspiracy theories, but digging deep enough, more than one big blocker (fan of r-btc) realized which of the two subs is the really toxic one. For one, keep reading this sub and you'll soon find out 90%+ of all the posts are all about 

* How shitty BTC is now because *not Satoshi vision*, with tons of links to the white paper

* Core = Blockstream (Hint: It's not, not by far)

* Supporting any coin that could damage BTC - First it was Bitcoin Cash, now it's S2X, and eventually it'll be something else; 

* A mis-guided belief that miners are all that matter in the ecosystem... because ""white paper"" (Hint: Miners mean very little. It's not immediately clear why, but once you get it, it'll be like seeing through the matrix. Also, miners know it.)

* A broken understanding of the role of *full nodes* (Hint: No, they don't ""slow down the network"", as Roger Ver would have you believe... they in fact keep miners and everyone else honest. Also why miners have very little power.)

* An unhealthy degree of conspiracies

* Blindsided adoration of the big block preachers (Roger Ver, Craig NotSatoshi Wright, ...)

* ...

Then there's the remaining <10% of posts which actually discuss how to improve Bitcoin Cash.

Overall, you'll notice that this sub does not give you much in terms of a postive/cheerful experience. It's mainly a lot of negativity.


&nbsp;

You can probably tell I'm not a fan of this sub, so you'll see my post downvoted into oblivion. I don't care. But you keep reading both subs, and give it some time before you ""pick your side"". Ask questions on both subs, and engage your critical thinking. I'm fairly positive I'll see you on r/bitcoin. Not only you'll get to understand how bitcoin works much better, it'll also bring many more smiles and laughs. :)

"As DA says, yes, read both subs.  There are toxic people on both sides, there are cool people on both sides.

If you ask pointed questions here, you'll get argument, debate, even downvotes.

Ask at r/bitcoin and you'll find that your posts are deleted.

Never. There will always be a segment of people that believe lies no matter how many facts are put in front of their faces, unfortunately
BS uses Projection, the latest in propaganda technologies. 
"I'm sure I remember an anonymous tell all article from an ex blockstreamer - Hill was into drugs according to that...

I expect they don't need further funding, they probably put a large amount of 79m into bitcoin years ago... "
That's just the business plan they want you to know.
The details of what it said don't matter, just like what drumpf says don't matter.
"Sidechains are open source and are not a layer two scaling solution.

Keep drinking the kool aid."
Sure. But anyone can make their own sidechain or use blockstreams services which they charge for. No problems here.
"That sounds like a legit business plan. The first time I'm hearing something like this. 

There's nothing wrong with providing a service for a fee. Setting up a custom sidechain or altcoin is a service. Also, this hardly harms Bitcoin. A few funding/settlement transactions on-chain, everything else hidden in a sidechain. Fine with me.

Don't get me wrong. It's not okay to cripple the Bitcoin chain. It's not okay to force soft-fork hacks onto the users. It's not okay to stall scaling and development. It's not okay to harass users and miners.

But, you know, building a business around sidechains, that's actually cool. Do I think they'll be successful? Based on what I know -- no product, nothing to demo --, probably not. But trying to start is business is never wrong. Good luck."
ITT: People who don't know what side chains are.
If you guys think you can do it better please go ahead, anyone can use Bitcoin to form their own ideas and if it sticks you get rewarded, this is what Blockstream is trying and free competition and free market always favors the end-user!
What part of free competition doesn't 'you' like?... Perhaps I should make a separate post..
Why not just start a new genesis block and have a McDonald's altcoin? Why do you need a sidechain?

"I don't care anymore. Let them do their BlockstreamCoin. I'm not even interested in S2X anymore.  
For people who are interested in a decentralized p2p crypto currency with low fees and fast transactions, there's Bitcoin Cash.  
I think it's clear who will win in the long-term."
There is literally a blog post on the actual Blockstream website plainly explaining how the use case of their products is to alleviate friction on public blockchains!
This will fail so insanely hard
First. I think this quote is highly taken out of context just as r/bitcoin does the same to you. Second, if SegWit is bad, why are so many non-blocckstream developers stoked for it? I follow bitcoin news almost hourly and I hear countless devs stoked for segwit and they're not from blockstream. 
What company in its right mind would trust BlockStream at this point?  The belligerent treatment of companies like CoinBase and RSK shows that you should not build your business on their tech for fear of them destroying your business when they throw a temper tantrum.
Kind of sounds like the definition of racketeering.  Cause a problem where there was none so you can profit off it. /u/tippr gild

"   G-Max has also [talked about this on BCT early last year.](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/435vcw/what_is_blockstream_selling_feebased_private/) Blockstream are somewhat open about it in other venues, but when pressed on this issue in /r/btc they are extremely vague or completely silent on how they plan to actually turn a profit. The reason that /u/nullc and /u/adam3us constantly throw smoke screens in our face is because the [conflict of interest regarding their business plan](https://imgur.com/a/WMoUB) versus what is best for bitcoin is so incredibly huge.

   Speaking of deception, does anybody who isn't G-Max or Adam have any more information on exactly why and how Austin Hill left Blockstream? My understanding is that they were secretly using him for his VC connections only, and once the dipshits got in bed with Barry good, Hill was pressured to leave. Now that Barry told them he will no longer be leading or even participating in investment rounds, Blockstream turned to the East by bringing in Samson Mow who likely guaranteed them at least one more round of $50-75million. This is why they are currently on their [""world tour""](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/78g23a/blockstream_is_on_a_world_tour_anyone_know_what/) trying to scam some more fools.

The point is that their business being successful depends on the main chain being unusable. Nobody will pay for sidechain usage if the main-chain has capacity. That's why they have a conflict of interest to harm Bitcoin."
They have one called Liquid, iirc. But its technology that banks don't need as they transact at orders of magnitude greater speed & volume.

However, when I read the quotes from Core and Blockstream employees that Roger Ver includes in his presentation about how the 1MB block size is to force development of off chain solutions, this to me suggests that it is more likely that the block size will be moderately unchoked at the point off-chain becomes a reality.

It makes no sense.  Choking the use of Bitcoin so that only holders, traders and investors will make use of it.  No way to unchoke it without undermining use of lightning network.  What a clusterfuck."

But he says that side chains won’t solve scaling and I’ve also read on the other bitcoin sub that core does think the block size should get larger just when it is safe. Not really sure what that means but it seems like everyone thinks another scaling solution needs to happen
This is a fantastic read! Why is there no author? And more importantly, when was it written? Where did you find it?
wow thats...scary
I had never read that, but it is so well-written. Why isnt this shared more often?
If both chains are at 50% hashpower, then the difficulty adjustment will happen 28 days later, not 14.
such a good read.
blockstream didn't just emerge with sidechains. people were talking about sidechains in 2012, maybe even earlier than that. years before blockstream was even founded.
"Nice written but parts of it is a non-problem. For instance, miners receive 12.5 BTC that is worth approximately 9 times the value of previous market value when the reward was 25 BTC. The network is VERY secure as it is, BTC network is eons from being unsecure therefore we do not need more hashing power at the time being, because that's what's it's all about in the end. If we make it more expensive to broadcast on-chain, more lucratively attracts more hashing power to the network which at this point is not needed, I would even suggest that we could cut of 50% of the hasingpower and the network would still be safe, so I don't see the point of the statement that ""it's unfairly cheap!"" Why would the great honest and superior miners suggest that we need more hashing power securing the network, we need to start from there before we make low (or even none) fees a problem that needs to be addressed!"
