When you type the same thing into google you see articles criticizing DDG

"Also the crucial difference is they target the ad at you only based on the specific query you searched for in that session, they don’t attempt to track you across search sessions (or across the web).

Anyone who searches for the same phrase gets the same ads."
Or that Google News wont list anything until somebody writes about it and it gets crawled
Whoops. Well now I look like a fool for not knowing that. Thank you adblockers lol.

"Caveat to this: [98% of Firefox's funding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Foundation#Financing) comes from Google as a grant in exchange for making it the default search engine.

So you're supporting more choices, but not necessarily more competition."
"If you want to move away from the old ad model which is what both Google and FF relies on, use Brave. 

https://www.xda-developers.com/how-brave-browser-supports-xda/"
Isn’t Brave also competing with Google?
Would be great of they kept ALSA support for Linux. Now that they dropped support and require Pulseaudio I doubt I will ever switch to Firefox.
But Chromium itself is already competition to google. It's already open source.
"There is the Palemoon fork.

Don't agree with some of (the Firefox) changes: like dropping Open Sound system support. I try to avoid any code written by Lennart Poettering."

It’s not. It’s the google cloud platform that got outage. Google search was never affected. Check the damn articles lmao
[deleted]
I really appreciate your levelheaded analysis of this event. I found it strange that an outage would affect their web crawler infrastructure also, but it’s definitely possible. see u/lgdly, this guy gets it.
Obviously you didn’t take the time to verify search parameters. it wasn’t a blanket web search- it was a **news** search with results from the last **24 hours**.
"I get a page that takes me to Amazon for a free DDG Amazon Search app.

it was real. you people are all SO fucking dumb. LOOK at the details. It was a “last 24 hours” search in **news**, not a general search
According to Wikipedia they are funded by advertising which can be switched off.
DDG is also supported by Brave BATs
"No big deal if they want to have ads as long as they're not based on tracking and storing your search results, etc. which supposedly they don't do.

"They have advertising.

Difference is that the ads are related to the individual search you just queried.

They do not save your searches to build an ad profile of you."
">  If a product is free, then you are the product.

Same. More than I can count from past couple of hours.
"> If a product is free you are the product 

This is wrong on so many levels. What about FLOSS like Linux, LibreOffice, Gimp, Firefox, etc. ? 

Your statement might be right for some software products but not for all of them."
You can also use !s to use startpage which uses google's search results but doesn't track you.
Yeah I only need Google for searching IT problems for my job, that's the only time it seems to yield better results. Now I'll just use !g at work.

Wouldn't their ad blocking functionality also break with the upcoming Chrome webRequest deprecation (the thing that will cripple uBlock Origin)? Google IS fighting ad blocking with some next release of both Chrome and Chromium upon which Brave is built.
I haven’t seen any posts from the brave team one way or the other on this topic, but I am certain they won’t take this lying down if they are impacted at all.  Agreed.  I will keep using brave and have a backup plan.
ad-blocking extension
"uBlock Origin (not to be confused with uBlock) is a great ad blocker: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm

Unlike AdBlock and uBlock it doesn't rely on ads for revenue, so it doesn't have a conflict of interest and it's open source https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock"
I know, but I'm angry at Google for attacking AdBlockers.
Without Firefox, there's no competition for Google. Supporting Firefox helps keep our choices open.
">Google services are down

Seriously, Google isn't perfect, or particularly great, but this is like saying a newspaper is bad for not reporting on their headquarters being attacked by terrorists. They probably would, *if their headquarters weren't currently being attacked by terrorists*."
It's good to question things but this thread is about comparison of ddg to Google. And Google search is free too.
Probably because this post is just a simple ad.

I can verify later this week, but I'm pretty sure apulse is not involved. Does that require dmix btw?
no i was looking for a relevant article that i knew already existed. that search query was the title of a CNN article that had been published 4 hours prior to this search.
we’ve already resolved it was due to google itself being down. doesn’t make the results i received at the time fake, asshole.
"Actually DDG is the only site I have in uBlock Origin's ""exception"" list. I don't mind their ads as long as they are well marked and not intrusive."
Well yes but it's the same with any search engine.
Source?
The new version is based on chromium
Yups
Didn't realize they did that. That sucks :/
I use Firefox without pulseaudio and it works fine. I have looked through my distro's patches, and I have not found anything relevant. It does link to libpulseaudio, but works without the daemon running. This is on Void.
True, but they seem to have more of a 'look, but don't touch' policy.

You have working Firefox audio with only alsa? Or you're using apulse maybe?
Yes you're a proof of that. Along with the salt.
google cloud was down. google search was generally working for me. other search queries with the same News>24 Hour modifiers worked just fine. it was only OP search term that returned 0 results. I found it odd and wanted to share. that’s it. i didn’t insult you- you immediately assumed it was photoshop or fake and you didn’t even do the due diligence of verifying the search parameters before screaming “FAKE”. you are an asshole.
Ok, seems like Brave understands what they're getting into. That's good!
Chromium is developed by google...
So the browser engine itself is from Google. It's Chrome with a different skin.
Void is rolling, so it is generally the most recent version (barring cross compiling, rust, and musl compatibility issues).
Sigh. I was here when it was posted, and confirmed it myself. Read the comments
Like why is this upvoted so much...it should be removed by mods
it was a “24 hour” results search only.... pay attention to details people damn.
And this is exactly why so many people are having trouble taking the Bitcoin crowd seriously. There’s so many great reasons to promote crypto but instead of talking about them, we’ve got OP posting fake bullshit and making everyone look like fools.
Just a shame about the name, I think that's part of the reason google took over from alta vista etc and nobody is going to start using the term duckduckgo it!

Shitggle is shit. Brave and personal clouds for my stuff.
I’ve tried ddg for a while it’s just not as good as a search engine. A lot of the times it gives you very random, unrelated results to what you actually want. Compared to google which optimizes it. That is at the expense of your data to be fair
"I feel like the interface is not as clean as google. with wider resolutions.

we all have bad habit of relying on one thing at a time, that's why google is more famous, because Google gave us services when no one else was able to think what google has delivered over past years. You won't ever find better service than google because like Yahoo!! there are so many other engines, they are loosing their popularity

a query here returns 'About 55’400 results (0.25 seconds) ' ... another fake news on /r/btc ... no suprise.
I have tons of results. I call b/s
At least it isn’t Bing.
I don't know what's the problem. I'm getting a lot of results just fine.
I want to support DDG but I'm still not satisfied with the results. Hopefully they can further improve.
"Holy crap!  

Not that I would have noticed.  I switched to Firefox and Duck Duck Go several months ago and never looked back."
Today I learned: Google does not know everything
Bing ftw
Put your tin foil hat away. Google was down, and you cherry picked how to show this information.
"Having recently switched from Chrome/Google to Firefox/DuckDuckGo I can say that DDG has improved a lot in a year since I've last tried to switch. So far 4 days in and not feeling like coming back. (Last time it was 2 hours before I gave up) 

EDIT: as u/265 correctly [mentions](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/bw34e4/a_reminder_why_you_shouldnt_use_google/epw009n/): you don't have to use DuckDuckGo with Firefox. Firefox works well with Google.

Was especially surprised by the fact that Firefox mobile has uBlock Origin (Chrome mobile doesn't).

With the upcoming breakage of uBlock on Chrome desktop - it's a no-brainer to switch.

Oh and if you haven't found it in DuckDuckGo just prepend !g in front of DDG query and you will be taken to Google with the same query.

EDIT: To everybody recommending Brave - you have to understand - Brave uses Chromium. Chromium will deprecate webRequest V3 API and hence will cripple all adblockers including Brave. It won't be completely broken, but severely crippled. [u/MisterChoky suggests that this is not the case yet](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/bw34e4/a_reminder_why_you_shouldnt_use_google/epvz3hg/)."
"I’m getting pages of results for that very same search with Google right now, 20 minutes after you posted this.

Edit.

My bad. Nothing at all when just filtering by “news” and “past 24 hours”.   But some generic full search results."
Coz they have an outage?
[Maybe google hates you](https://i.imgur.com/X0WCvPB.png)
Well, to be fair, they were down, so how would they index this news? Not a fair comparison.
lol @ the people who believe that google censors news about a server outage
Fake...
mine is showing a bunch of articles it is not blank
Did you consider it might be blank because Google is down? There's plenty of hits if you Google this exact phrase
So, either Google had been censoring the news about their massive outage in the first couple of hours, **or** the outage has affected their web crawler infrastructure, and thus the ability to index recent news articles... Which one is it? Gee, I don't know, but it sure finds these articles fine now!
If you take a second to think about it, this post is literally the symbol of stupidity. Almost as stupid as trying to figure out if a person is a witch by downing them.
Searched that exact thing on Google and got plenty of results. Google is an awful manipulative company. There's no need to make up lies just report the true shitty things they have done. This is such pointless bullshit and it saddens me how many have upvoted.
Crypto will make the giant corporations obsolete. They're already dead, they just don't know it.

"I tried to switch to DDG, but it made me realize how much I rely on Google's quick info results (e.g. search for ""movie showtimes"" and it lists all the movies playing at all the theaters around you, aggregating multiple websites).

Is there any solution for that? Do I have to know in advance that I'm going to want the quick info and use the !g trick?"
You don't have to use DDG with Firefox. Firefox is a must for the reasons you mentioned, regardless of your search engine preference.
Brave has committed on their own sub to forking, patching out, or otherwise sanitizing this api change out of principle.
"Haven’t looked back since switching to Brave.

And they have a plan for when chromeium breaks ad-blockers."
Can't reproduce. I'm getting tons of news articles from google.
Yup. I just threw up pitchforks at OP myself until I read your comment. It checks out.
[News in the past 24](https://i.imgur.com/N6CM4A4.png) hours is working again. Maybe it was because google was down?
You should switch away from Firefox and onto Brave or Dissenter browsers. It's basically Chrome but with embedded adblock/anti tracking. Works exactly like Chrome, you can install all chrome addons, but without supporting or being spied on by Google.
""
What's ublock if you don't mind explaining?
Google is now pay-for-exposure but DDG is only better than Google because it's much less popular. The moment it'll be popular as Google the edge they have will be lost since their user profiles will be far more complete.
Use brave you get paid and use what ever search engine you want on the back end.
I admire what Duck Duck Go is working to achieve, but this thought still lingers in the back of my mind: If a product is free, then you are the product. How does DDG sustain itself? Who funds it and why? Duck Duck Go is not a charity.
The service was down, and they expected it to work, while it was down, to show that it was down.  If it worked enough to show it was down, it wouldn't BE down... I mean shit.  The lack of logic that went into this post is astonishing.
Or maybe because google was down?
Google is evil.
