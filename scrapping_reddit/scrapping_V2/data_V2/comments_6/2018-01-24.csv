Sorry that’s not how the pros do it. 
You don't even need a device to carry Bitcoins. Just the seed or private key which can be hidden anywhere. Searching suitcase or bags is futile.
Still not moving it physically. It's the exact same thing with fiat currency. 
Pull out a gold bitcoin coin and give it to them. They’ll think you’re bribing them 😂
Ouuhh, my first gild. Thank you!!
The people doing arbitrage Korea / USA are moving bitcoin.
To carry Bitcoin across borders, all you realistically need to do is write down the private key or seed in a tiny piece of paper and put it somewhere safe. There is no need for laptop or flash drive which can be searched or even a fancy sticker for that matter.

No, because for arbitrage you buy BTC in one exchange, and send the BTC to the other exchange and sell it there.
U sure they aren’t moving USD?  Usually for arbitrage you have an account on each of the exchanges you want to use. so you can buy and sell crypto on all your exchanges you don’t have to move stuff which is inefficient. 
"Actually it really depends on the location of the wallet. This is how laws work with websites (when you hear pirate bay relocated servers to XXX, this is what they’re doing) and that would set to precedent for bitcoin wallets.

You cannot move bitcoin physically. If you have a wallet, you are moving keys around - the means of accessing bitcoin.

"P2P money such as Bitcoin Cash protects against many forms of fraud. But no, you're right, it doesn't on it's own provide any sort of ""undo button"" in the form that PayPal, banks or the state provides. "
"The only way it stops fraud is in things like banks opening unauthorized accounts or people creating unathorized credit cards, since those are technically forms of fraud.

Although using bitcoin won't stop any of those anyway unless you ditch them 100%, which nobody does since you can't really live a normal life using only bitcoin (without any fiat).

Any sort of ""fraud"" that is caused by having sent money that you shouldn't have and you're S.O.L, and honestly that's the fraud I think of when I think of fraud: things like paying for an item and receiving another or nothing at all, etc."

That’s as fast as you can get. Still it’s still not comparable to some of other altcoins out there. Eg xrp
">The only way it stops fraud is in things like banks opening unauthorized accounts or people creating unathorized credit cards, since those are technically forms of fraud.

No, Bitcoin stops things like charge back fraud and central banks manipulating your currency.

>Although using bitcoin won't stop any of those anyway unless you ditch them 100%, which nobody does since you can't really live a normal life using only bitcoin (without any fiat).

You can already live 100% on Bitcoin, it just isn't for the average person yet. Which we hope will become normal at some point in the future. 

>Any sort of ""fraud"" that is caused by having sent money that you shouldn't have and you're S.O.L, and honestly that's the fraud I think of when I think of fraud: things like paying for an item and receiving another or nothing at all, etc.

This is what you have escrow for, at least unless something much more advanced gets integrated into Bitcoin. Satoshi had plans, but they might have been for side chains. Old fiat currency doesn't give you any fraud protection either. With them, still only payment services, or if you count states, do that."
Good point.
"It prevents many types of fraud per the design PDF, but it doesn't offer specifically a way to reverse transactions or using a 3rd party for escrow, often known as ""fraud prevention"". It's principal function is to make coins that are themselves independent of such schemes."
Cash dollars are significantly more P2P than putting them in a savings account or using a plastic card, but not as P2P as a distributed time stamp server run by PoW nodes which are able to avoid central banks as well.
"Yes, it's great that they understand the importance of a secure leaderless, open source, decentralized network and how, now in 2018, that is so much more important than competing with paypal through a centralized completely corporAte controlled network like bcash.

Smart move."
That is hilarious, there is literally no other way to do it.
Fraud is reversing transactions and unknown transactions. Bitcoin allows neither 
"> Bitcoin stops things like charge back fraud

Charge back fraud is an outcome from abusing fraud protection mechanisms, so without any of those mechanisms it's obvious that they can't be abused, but honestly that's like saying that you should buy a boat and live on the sea since you'll avoid 100% of car crashes.

> central banks manipulating your currency

That's not what fraud is.

> You can already live 100% on Bitcoin, it just isn't for the average person yet.

Then you can't lead a normal life. If you can't live a life without touching any form of fiat, be it through credit cards, physical cash, bank accounts, etc, then you can't ditch them 100%.

> This is what you have escrow for, at least unless something much more advanced gets integrated into Bitcoin.

Sure, but that still isn't any form of fraud protection, it's exactly the same as with paying for things in cold hard cash, which ties into your next statement:

> Old fiat currency doesn't give you any fraud protection either.

Never said it did. Credit cards do, though."

Yes, that's called investing. What you're seemingly recommending is for people to gamble a large portion of their net worth. Which is fine, if you're young and have a small net worth. But if you're ten years away from retirement and have a net worth measured in 7 figures, gambling away money you don't have decades to get back is a stupid move.
The lower ticker and market “bug” on the bottom right are removed for officially released CNBC news clips.  Since they show real-time market data at the time of shooting for Live TV, those screen elements are barred from redistribution as prerecorded clips by agreement with the exchange sources (mostly for liability purposes). 
For a major news outlet, that can be years ahead of their peers.
It should be the opposite. Mainstream news gets to that mainstream money.

"I was saying on general terms. Do you really think somebody that only has $400 of *total assets* should be investing time and effort into the learning curve that investing in crypto currently entails?

Whereas I agree that buying a car brand new is a waste of money, I highly disagree with your implication that newer cars are not safer. 
"""If you only have $400, you should NOT buy $20 worth of crypto and hodl for a year. Bad move""
spoken like a true reddit genius."
"I've never identified with the mindset that says a newer car is safer, or even worth buying.  My newest vehicle ever is 2002. :)

When I was in HS, a kid wrapped his new car around a tree coming back to school from lunch.  Killed his companion instantly and put himself in a months long coma before he died also.  It was the kid's second new car - he had wrecked the first.

To me kid + new car = wreck.

I have 8 kids.  They'll have to pay for their own cars.  I'll encourage them never to pay for a new car.  Although they are saving their money in BitcoinCash, so one of these days they might actually be able to afford it if that's what they want to put their money into."
Well, not really, if they can make or save money by using crypto instead... They would actually be using it as a currency, spending most if not all they get, not really holding as an investment. (I'm assuming by poor people you mean people who live paycheck to paycheck - people who don't have money left to invest in anything)
Yes that is one of the paradoxes of car buying. It is safe(r), because it has 17 airbags, but kids take risks with cars, and the safer the car, the larger the risk, and nowadays, every new car now has tattle-tale chips in them, so little Timmy could go strait from school to jail, as every new driver 'tests' how fast a car can go, and you don't want tattle-tale car telling everything to the cops, and making your kids first drive their last drive...
translation: poor people should stay out of crypto
"> one is to get a nice, safe, new car that will keep your kiddies safe and be useful for a long time

When I was a kid the kids with new cars were not the ones who were safe."
">  if 5% of your assets is only 20 bucks

In that case you should be focusing on ways to improve your active income (or decrease your spending) so you can actually save something and have some assets. Spending time learning about unusual investments might not be the most productive thing for you to do right now."
Going to 0 is not realistic. And if it was, I don't think you should be investing anything in it. 
"Diversification explains the existance of shitcoins.  Stay with me here: What if the only reason shitcoins continue to exist is because of index mentality?

Dogecoin's $2 Billion Value: So High, Much Fall

https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/01/remember-dogecoin-the-joke-currency-soared-to-2-billion-this-weekend/

"
I don't think newbs should look at crypto as just another asset class, like timber or gold. Its a lot more like your first car, a completely new way of doing things. There are two schools of thought on first cars, one is to get a nice, safe, new car that will keep your kiddies safe and be useful for a long time, the other is to get them some trashy junker in the style they like (convertible, muscle car, whatever) that they (or you) can buy in cash, and toss them to the wolves. If you don't know, the junker is the way to go 100%, because they are gonna fSk up whatever car you get them, and you don't want to start your adult life with a huge car note, and a wreck in your driveway. Everyone I know that started with a new car regretted it, unless it survived 10 years, and if it did survive, they still would have been better off buying used, and skipping the debt. Sending grandma a computer code to her infected PC with the value of a house is a recipe for disaster, and not just it declines in value, you need to learn how to USE and STORE this stuff, and when you learn the hard way what a crypto is, you want to learn with a few thousand Dogecoin, and not your total net worth. Once they have been in it a year and know what cold storage and hardware wallets are, then they can up the percentage, when they are ready. Also, I think until the altcoin market shakes out, we are at a short term top, so its a non-ideal time to go all in. The cryptos are partying like its 1999 internet 1.0 time, and there will be a MUCH better time to get all in, once the froth blows off. And no, we will not need 1000+ trash coins 10 years from now, just like every town no longer has its own phone company that uses barbed wire as a telephone line, like they did at the start of the telephone age. The phone was actually a world-changing invention, and made investors tons of money, but history showed that that was not the right time for n00bs to go 50% + on this telephone future, and its the same for crypto today

No, not gamble. But if they do think it's an investment, then actually do invest something. 5% is meaningless. An extraordinary success would mean very little to you. Why bother?
But if you diversify that much what do you accomplish? Just make the math. A 50% gain is something great and an unique opportunity in investing, but that would only raise your assets by 2,5%... becomes meaningless.

I don't understand how Stripe would become irrelevant in the wake of alternative payment solutions that use BCH. I've used Stripe's API on a website that I built and I have to give them credit for how simple they make it. They have a widget that works with only minor adjustments that somebody who doesn't know how to program can make, and they have an API with which one can leverage to design their own payment system. Admittedly, I haven't looked into too many payment solutions, but Stripe was so pleasant to work with that I'd be willing to go back to them without even looking at the competition. And this is before accounting for cryptocurrencies.

Last I downloaded LN it basically was setup to fire up in a test mode that printed 1000 fake coins, similar to how Golem is right now. What is the default state if I build and run LN, does it connect to mainnet or still print test currency?

BTC has been steadily losing both users and market share. At this rate, it will eventually be dethroned, and rightly so.
Same the delay on the part of bitpay is a pathetic it should not take this long to flip the switch. The only thing holding them back is fear of upsetting the btc crowd further while their customers flee the sinking ship at this rate. I just want to be able to spend crypto without a $10 + fee  .

It's not just about censorship to me. Control of btc has been taken over by special interests, the same people doing the censoring. They're running it into the ground for their benefit and that's why it makes me happy to see btc hemorrhage users and businesses.

"I think you are misunderstanding the issue here - you are not a customer of Stripe, other businesses are their customers, ie they are a B2B company.

Meh, I agree in principle and disagree in practice. Yes I agree if you aren't in control of your private keys you have no coins. However, in practice accepting many different payments (like using CoinPayments.net API) is a serious burden not to mention liquidating between them or to USD automatically.
"I agree, I never left it enabled because it confused customers and support staff. Stripe seems to be well branded as ""put your credit card here"""
"Bitcoin was never (and still isn't) their primary audience. They make hand over fist simply accepting shitty credit card payments for millions of sites (average 2.5% + $0.30 per TX) This is a drop in the bucket for them.

Keeping anything enabled in their service / structure has a cost. Keeping Bitcoin supported, handling the (likely growing) amount of support requests, etc. all has a cost. A few employees a year puts the cost near $100k/yr easily.

Also consider that they have an uphill battle to fight. I'm a Bitcoin supporter since 2011 and I was around when Stripe first enabled support for accepting coin as payment - I was actively using their API already when they released the Beta to accept coins.

I don't use Stripe for accepting coins because it's confusing for merchants and support staff. Keeping Stripe entirely for credit cards is easier for everyone, with coin payments being handled by CoinPayments.net or another service that specializes in it."

How so?

"> But those channels will be updated very rarely, only when that specific user spends money, so they're not problematic.

If the LN is to be widely adopted, most users and most payments will be in that class.  

Those users are expected to make at least 1 payment per day, on average.  If there are  10 million users, that is already 4 times the current volume of BTC transactions.  And each LN payment will be at least 5 channel payments...

> Not all of them will be active at once but ok, let's say close to a million nodes

Again, the purpose of the LN is to let bitcoin scale to 100 times that number, and let people use bitcoins like they use credit cards, without waiting for Moore's Law.  

> onion routing as applied to LN is not about the IP adresses at all, it's about using the same method to hide where the money is coming from and going to. Each node unwraps their layer of encryption to discover to whom to send next.

Are you sure, or are you guessing?

Even if that were the case, the path finder node will know exactly which LN users (represented by LN user ID numbers)  are in the path; and the information about channel payments, that each user must broadcast to all path finders (all other users, in the current implementation), must be open, and must identify the channel -- hence the LN user IDs.

> I think that problem becomes smaller as the network grows and becomes more connected.

The bottlenecks will be in the immediate vicinity of the source and destination nodes.    The size of the network will not matter; what will matter is the averge number of channels per user, and the capacities of those channels.

For example, suppose that you have 60 BTC locked in 4 channels, funded with 15 bitcoins each in both directions; and you have only 10 BTC of capacity remaining in each channel.  You still have 40 BTC unspent, but you cannot make a payment of 11 BTC to anyone.  

You could do a circular payment to yourself and ""top up"" the capacity of one channel with some of the capacity from other channels.  However, the max capacity of any of those channels is 30 BTC, so you still cannot make a 31 BTC payment to anyone.

Your four immediate neighbors may have the same problem: it may be that all their outgoing channels, except those to you, have capacities below 5 BTC.  Then you cannot make a 6 BTC payment, even though all your channels could handle it.  

> connection bandwidth [is equivalent to LN channel capacity].

Not at all.  For one thing, once a packet got through a link, its capacity is still the same.  Once a pament went through an LN channel, its capacity is permanently reduced.  

Also, packet routing does not need to take capacities into account for every packet.  Load balancing between alternate links is done separately, at a higher level and at lower pace, by fiddling with the routing tables.

>  These doesn't seem relevant to routing, it happens after a path is chosen.

No, when a packet is injected into the internet, it does not know which path it will follow.  (That is the essence of ""packet routing"", the huge breakthrough that distinguished the internet from the ""circuit routing"" used by the phone networks of the 1970s.) 

If the packet's destination IP is outside of your ISP, the ISP just sends it to a backbone provider.  The latter then will either deliver it to another ISP, or push it forward to some other backbone provider.  The internet has ""routing"" but no ""path finding"".

> Not in LN either, if it uses a distributed routing algorithm.

But that is the point: there is no disctributed path-finding algorthm that would let the LN scale better than raw bitcoin.  At the moment, the algorithms one can think of scale much worse.  

> This is similar to the ""network of big hubs"" topology that many expect LN to become. 

Indeed, the hubs will have an even stronger motivation to fuse than mining pools have.  A single large hub will be *a lot* more efficient and profitable than two hubs of half its size.  

So the LN, if it were to become reality, would almost certainly be one big hub, with every user connected to it by one channel.  It will be as centralized as Visa, and **more** centralized than the credit card (or banking) industry is today.  And of course **much** more expensive, clunky, unsafe, slow, inefficient, etc.

> Routing algorithms don't depend or work better on physical networks

Packet routing on the internet works because there is a hierarchy of central entities that collectively know the topology of the physical network, and where each IP is attached to it.  Interenet routing is decentralized at the packet level because the gateways between physical networks need only know the sets of IPs that are on the parts of the network that they are attached to.

LN payment routing cannot do that.  Because of the capacities and the need to negotiate atomic multhop transfers, it must find the complete path beforehand.

> >  it assumes that sending a message from any user to any user is an atomic operation.

> Does it?

Yes, it uses the internet as a big black box that connects any IP to any IP, and does not care about the routing of internet packets.  

If it uses onion routing for the messages, then that is another conceptual layer between the internet and the LN.  For the LN, sending an (onion) message from any user to any user is still one atomic operation.  For the onion routing layer, sending a message from any onion node to any onion node (through the internet) is one atomic operation."
">Consider the typical user who receives a salary once a month and then spends it piecewise during that month. Most of the time, the payments through his channels will be all in the same direction (out).

But those channels will be updated very rarely, only when that specific user spends money, so they're not problematic.

>It is hard to estimate the number of active of bitcoin users, but optimistically they are several million. Thus a million nodes is what the LN should handle *now*.

Not all of them will be active at once but ok, let's say close to a million nodes, seems like a good goal.

>Moreover, the LN is meant to let bitcoin scale, faster than Moore's Law; so what matters is how it would handle hundreds of millions of users, not a few thousand.

Eventually, of course that's the objective. But right now as long as it helps enough to keep fees low, that's already useful and can then be improved upon to scale much more over time.

>That's because each LN payment will require 5-10 channel payments.

6 degrees of Kevin Bacon, Bitcoin being a much smaller network than the human species it's likely that you'll almost always need less than 6 hops.

>Only if they delegate path finding to some (ahem) trusted service. 

You're right, giving a bad route to someone can delay their transaction or increase fees (by doing more hops or passing through more expensive nodes).

>Onion routing will only hide the IPs of the computers who are sending the messages.

No, onion routing as applied to LN is not about the IP adresses at all, it's about using the same method to hide where the money is coming from and going to. Each node unwraps their layer of encryption to discover to whom to send next. 

It can be combined with Tor to hide IP addresses as well. 

>Path finding will not be possible if that information is obfuscated. Once the KGB (who will happen to be running that path finding service) determines that node 111552 is Alice and node 552551 is Zoe...

That's a good point, I guess that some conditions must be met for your transaction to be relatively hard to find, mostly being of low value.

>No, ""failure"" means the system will not be able to find a working path between you and the merchant, even though you still have enough funding left in your channels.

Doesn't that mean that there are no (or almost none) available paths to the merchant? I think that problem becomes smaller as the network grows and becomes more connected.

>Many of these channel payments will have to be broadcast *promptly*, as separate messages, to all path finders. 

This seems to reinforce the idea that LN is mostly suited for small payments. The less frequently big payments happen, channel imbalances that need to be broadcast also will be less frequent.

>For one thing, there is no concept equivalent to the balance of payment channes,

There is, connection bandwidth. It's damn near equivalent actually.

>and no need to broadcast information about every packet hop to every gateway in the world.

Not in LN either, if it uses a distributed routing algorithm.

>Internet packets travel one hop at a time: there is no need to negotiate the entire path from scratch, with all gateways, before sending each packet.

These doesn't seem relevant to routing, it happens after a path is chosen.

>Each telecom company that owns and operates a part of the physical network has a central server that knows the IPs of its users and how to phisically reach them; and it will send packets addressed for other IPs to other telecom companies that it has gateways to. 

This is similar to the ""network of big hubs"" topology that many expect LN to become. While that topology isn't great for competition, it does make path finding simpler.

>More generally, the LN has no concept of physical network.

Routing algorithms don't depend or work better on physical networks, if anything they work worse because then you have to deal with all the unexpected quirks and failure modes of real-life hardware.

>it assumes that sending a **message** from any user to any user is an atomic operation.

Does it?

>Even so, a suitable path finding algorithm for the LN is still missing.

This is probably right, but it doesn't seem like an impossible problem. We might have to settle for a ""good enough"" algorithm that fails occasionally and is a bit annoying, though. "
