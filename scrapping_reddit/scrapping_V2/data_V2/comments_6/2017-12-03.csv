Layer 2 solutions like LN are centralized and also fee restrictive. What’s the value proposition versus a centralized system since Lightning transactions can be censored by the hubs.
">I have faith in all of them

If you consider where bitcoin is today, there track record is simply terrible.   So I think your faith is completely misplaced.

Are you aware of the horrible bugs that were found in the Segwit2x code? .... or the seemingly complete lack of understanding of economics and game theory that some of the key members seem to have?    It's -almost- like they are trying to harm bitcoin on purpose. "
good points
"Cool, we agree, the time frame to scale is the only variable worth discussion.

Lets do some math.

[Here](https://i.imgur.com/KO5iJVu.png) is a graph I made of Bitcoin tx per day, the trend line shows that continuing as it has been (I took transactions from July 2013 to July 2016 so as not to include the artificial limit that 1MB blocks imposes) we will reach 7bn tx/day around 2034.

Moore's Law, assuming it doesn't slow down, doubles around every 18 months, so in the 16 years between now and 2034, there will be 10.6 of these doublings. 

Lets not start with Bitcoins artificially limited 1MB blocks, let's start with BCH 8MB blocks, block #479469 was a full 8BM, and had 37,814 transactions. If all blocks were full, this would be 5.4 million tx per day, 1.15GB per day, 420GB per year. I'm not sure this would run on a raspberry PI, but would still fit rather well into the ""spare hardware I have laying around"" category for a lot of people today.

7 billion tx per day = 48611111 tx per block, that is 1285 times a 8MB block or roughly 10GB per block.

going on 2^ 10.6 increase Moore's Law should provide us as above, that will give us 8MB * (2^10.6) = 12.4GB blocks

So it is plausible that raw block size increase could keep up with the current increase trend in transactions on ""spare hardware"", given Moore's Law continues. There are other improvements that can be made also, better thin blocks, block compression, better multi threaded code etc. On the other hand, 7bn/tx/day IMO is a very low target for 2034, I would expect to see Bitcoins transactions grow much larger, much faster than that if allowed too. I read Alipay hit 1bn/tx/day in 2016 and that's just one payment handler in one country. Micro payments becoming popular could increase that some orders of magnitude. 

Basically, IMO, while it is certainly a real possibility, I myself would not say that I am 100% confident I can run a 7 billion tx/day node when we have 7 billion tx/day. It is for sure not a certainty. "
Totally agree, until LN is working and shown to be non-centralized, I am not a supporter either (Although I would *like* it to work)
true, but it also comes with alot of costs tradeoffs due to it being different.
Youre more than welcome not to subscribe to that argument. I prioritize changing the world for the better - if commodity hardware will be enough tjat is great, and I hope it will, but my **certainty** that I will still be able to help run the network comes from a full-perspective view.
And because I like to stir, devils advocate says that Lightning Network requires ~66MB blocks to do 7bn/tx/day, following the same Moore's Law calculation above, LN will be able to do what on chain block scaling can do in 16 years in only 4.5 :P
Remember that I factor in what kind of hardware I should expect to have to spare when my wealth is raised according to adoption. Today I have modest not too old consumer hardware to spare. I  20 years if we end up with 7bn transactions I expect to have slightly better hardware to spare, say a handful or highpower clusters on then-modern hardware. **to spare**
I don't subscribe to that argument, personally, I don't want only the rich to be able to be part of running the network, regardless if they are old or new money. 
Preach!

"Except that Satoshi predicted all of this and laid out the plans for it.

He predicted that nodes would be run by everyone at first and eventually only by a few miners.

core/blockstream lie to us and tell us that everyone needs a node for the system to work.

Another flaw in your argument is that what is the Core Coin then?  It isn't Bitcoin.  They should give up the name Bitcoin and call it Segwit Improved Coin.

BCH IS Bitcoin."

"Are you sure?

"That's funny, he must have forgotten to include the part that says "" a hundred thousand miners.""

No matter how you look at it, when you read everything and anything he wrote, it sounds more like BCH than BTC:

""Long before the network gets anywhere near as large as that, it would be safe 
for users to use Simplified Payment Verification (section 8) to check for 
double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or 
about 12KB per day.  **Only people trying to create new coins would need to run 
network nodes.  At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the 
network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to 
specialists with server farms of specialized hardware.  A server farm would 
only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with 
that one node.**

""The bandwidth might not be as prohibitive as you think.  A typical transaction 
would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact).  Each transaction has to be 
broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction.  Visa processed 37 billion 
transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day.  
That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or 
2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices.

**""If the network were to get that big, it would take several years, and by then, 
sending 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a big deal.""**

Dimitri argues with a simple game-theory-based model that basically, bitcoin mining will never be a monopoly, but it will never be highly-decentralized either.  It won't be a monopoly because it will always be profitable for a second player to enter the market, and it won't ever have hundreds of thousands of miners either because the profit margins would become too slim.

"He says that he never anticipates that there will be more than 100,000 nodes - probably less.  This could mean 100, 1,000, 10,000, 50,000 or less than 100,000.  What he does say is in my post above that initially, there will be many full nodes but in time, there will be few and only run by miners.

In the end, if you compare all of his writings to BTC and BCH you will see that he does not describe BTC + 2nd and 3rd layers + LN + smart contracts.  He clearly states that the block size will increase as there is greater demand.

This worked great for 7 or 8 years and only didn't work once the block sizes bumped the 1mb limit."

Anyway, the bar keeper, Ronald, keeps track of your tab on a yellow paper pad. When he gets tired and decides to close the bar he counts up how many tick marks your name has, and that's what you pay.

So to all of the naysayers out there, against tabs, I present this story to show the rugged utility and simple elegance of such a system, which has certainly stood the test of time.

"I agree about the asset aspect being a side effect of demand and scarcity.  But also security.  Nobody wants to buy a nice plot of land if there are no property laws to protect the ownership.

I don't think an increase to 8MB would bring the network down, but it's a step in the wrong direction.  I also disagree with the urgency for a blocksize increase.  Bitcoin won't be dead in 18 months due to high fees because it doesn't need to function as a currency to thrive.  There's no doubt that enabling better scaling (all things equal) will help it grow, but it's filling a very useful utility to many people as it currently exists.  It's also nonsensical to argue that high fees will destroy it (akin to arguing that nobody will go to a restaurant if it's too crowded).  The fee levels are equalized by market demand.

The only thing that would cause bitcoin to become irrelevant is if some other crypto finds a better scaling solution and becomes more adopted.  There are some interesting projects in this regard (such as the DAG tech of IOTA or Byteball).  I don't find BCH's solution particularly interesting at all however.

Imagine you have a bunch of gold stored in a safe.  Do you want to switch to a smaller, more portable safe which is still fairly secure?  Most people would rather stick with the huge safe which is bolted to the walls of their house.  After all they aren't needing to access that gold all the time, there are other instruments for buying things.

If you feel there is no downside to increasing the blocksize limit, then there's no point in discussing further.  But I do disagree with that assumption."

Nope. It’s all about Blockstream saying people can still use BTC on a daily basis with merchants without having to worry about high fees by keeping a tab with them, then making a single transaction after a certain period. You know, cause we’re living in the future and BTC is definitely helping people move their money easily, without third parties and on the cheap.

"> No other crypto subs are like this

No other crypto sub was created like r/btc. Over scaling debate. Blockstream is a huge part of it"
"To be fair, /r/btc was created as a protest against the censorship in /r/bitcoin. It's therefore not the same as any other crypto sub.  However, I think you're wrong.  Go and look in /r/bitcoin and an awful lot of the posts there are directly or indirectly attacking Bitcoin Cash.

It's not really a surprise there is lasting animosity.  Bemoaning it is a waste of breath, as with all the Internet -- don't like it?  Don't read it.

In the end, I actually think the competition is a good thing.  It's making both coins stronger (from their own point of view)."
"What do you mean by the ""asset aspect""? The asset aspect in my opinion is a side effect of bitcoin being both in demand and scarce. Those two things are completely by the wayside of the scaling argument. Do you mean security through decentralisation? Like, you worry that bigger blocks = more centralised = easier to bring the network down? From what I've read that's just completely unfounded unless you're trying to run a full node on a raspberry pi or 10 year old PC. Harddrives are already incredibly cheap, and they're getting cheaper all the time. And the ""slippery slope"" argument that once the block size is raised once, it will lead to 1GB blocks in no time at all is just ridiculous and a blatant ""fingers in ears"" kind of excuse. Bitcoin needs a block size increase RIGHT NOW. The developers can keep working on lightning or whatever else might work further down the road, but ""lightning in 18months!!"" doesn't do anything to solve anything until it's actually here. If the developers keep up that kind of stubbornness bitcoin could be dead by the time lightning comes out.

And I don't agree that both sides want it to function as both an asset and a currency. Tons and tons of tweets and reddit comments that prove otherwise (by pro-Core people). Or at the least there's a very vocal group who don't want that who probably fit into one of about three categories: 1. pure hodlers - they don't give a shit about using it, they're just there for the moon and their ""digital gold"". 2. tech purists - they don't give a shit about transactions, they only care about full nodes and want bitcoin to live up to the purest vision of decentralisation possible. 3. profiteers/anti-miners - people who will profit off the market demand for sidechains created as a result of on-chain throttling, or people who just hate miners and want them to lose profitability."
"> If you see /r/btc and BCH as the continuation of the original project

Not exactly. Bitcoin Cash is the continuation of Bitcoin. r/btc is a place for bitcoiners (now both BTC and BCH holders) who were pushed off r/bitcoin over scaling debate which turned into digital civil war long before Bitcoin Cash appeared. Until war is over, r/btc won't stop discussing BTC. The end of war is unclear: it may end with end of existence of PoW Bitcoin Core on current scale (less profitable to mine for prolong period of time) or may end only sometime later when the most prominent ""fighters"" will retire"
Because /r/btc is a direct result of, and reaction to, /r/bitcoin. There's a lot of anger and frustration about how bitcoin was hijacked. How would you feel if someone came into your home, kicked you out and started living in your home, all the while trashing your belongings and tossing insults at you?
LOL, - Adam Back is now a high class shill. 
I mean, a currency I can actually use day to day kind of *is* the future.
"Everyone wants the same thing.  Both sides *want* it to function as an asset and a currency.  BCH'ers feel that BTC is not giving enough weight to the currency aspect.  BTC'ers feel that BCH is not giving enough weight to the asset aspect.

Personally I feel the asset aspect is far more important, and that 2nd layer solutions for small amounts of money to transact in is completely acceptable.  Not an old-fashion tab obviously, but a more refined and robust network.  Sure it would be great if blockchains scaled infinitely and we could just transact everything in bitcoin forever.  There are good reasons for not simply increasing the blocksize limit.  I hope that you are aware of them even if you are pro BCH.

I have nothing against BCH and am happy there was a fork.  I do wish people would be less partisan about it and make rational points when debating between the two."

"/u/adam3us is not CEO material unfortunately. His work experience seems to be consulting, i.e. he has no experience communicating vision, managing brand, raising capital and other CEO tasks that are mostly non-tech related. In fact, none of the big names in Blockstream are CEO material. They are all techies and like most techies (me included) we think we are the smartest people in the room.

My advice to Blockstream is to find a professional CEO and give Adam a position that he is better suited to such as Chief Scientist (after all, he has done quite a bit of crypto research). 

My other advice is to find a professional product manager to drive their roadmap.

Currently, their products are engineer wishlists such as satellite one-way broadcast and DVEP, which is a ripple/tether knockoff. I realize I don't have full visibility into their opportunities and decision making, but the vision seems fragmented. Are they building sidechains? Lightning? Liquid? Who are the customers? What is the revenue model? All of this looks like they are chasing random ideas that developers dream up instead of being driven by strategic goals. This is a classic case of engineers acting as product managers. Many startups with great talent have died because there was no coherent product/market strategy.

Im bothering to give this advice because it would be a terrible waste of talent to work on random shit that will never be a success. If you don't fix this soon, I will look to poach great talent from your team such as Pieter Wuille and Andrew Polestra when Blockstream starts to sink.

"The CEO of Blockstream said to a a No2X supporter who was expressing concern that bitcoin adoption was suffering as payment service business because cant on-bord new customers because high fees to transact in bitcoin. He asked Adam Back what he should do. 

Adam responded saying, and I paraphrase: you don't actually need to use the blockchain to settle a transaction, you could form a relationship with the merchant and if you both use BTC, start a tab - you could keep track of who owes who and run a tab. 

He finished off the question saying, don't look to us to solve your problems bitcoin is open source you can go fix your own problem. 

In short if Adam was saying Use BCH, a fork of bitcoin that fixes that problem by removing the transaction limit, but obviously I'm paraphrasing and you need to watch the clip to actually believe it.

"You gotta keep some ""opposition"" around, to keep the cult from being too obvious."
I think that image just perfectly sums up the state of bitcoin at the moment.
"Yeah. Nah. 

*Both* parties put an equal amount of bitcoin into the tab. Transactions occur. At the end the difference is paid out. 

Interestingly either party can take all the money in the tab at any time, it just takes eight hours to clear. And if one party attempts that then the other party can take all the money instantly. Game theory. 

“Tabs” can work on the bch chain too, but with caveats like not being able to automate the functionality of the previous paragraph; don’t sleep with an open channel. "
So basically... I give you this piece of paper that’s basically an IOU that’s backed by my own BTC (or maybe the amount I think I’ll have in the future... or even you know, some amount that may or may not be there at all) and maybe we can print special papers with fixed numbers that people can use on a daily basis without having to worry about those complex transactions that take forever and maybe we can create companies where people can have their IOUs stored and secured so they don’t have to carry them around at all times. And if it really starts working, we can speak to our governments so they help us with mass adoption and provide us with protection and insurance in case something happens and some evil hacker steals our IOUs. Sounds great, right??

If you don't like tab's just fork off, or join the Bitcoin Cash community, its open and almost free to use.

It's a process of healing.
"You sound like a fairly rational person judging by how you worded this comment, so maybe you stand a chance of coming around. This sub is called /r/btc because it is made up largely of the original bitcoin community who were banned from /r/bitcoin, and it existed before bitcoin cash was forked as a place for people to freely discuss how to scale bitcoin. 

Bitcoin cash isn't a divergence from bitcoin - the current project called bitcoin is the divergence. That's not an opinion, that's just what's happened. BCH was a last resort after several years of stonewalling and refusal to cooperate with people who wanted bitcoin to remain a viable currency. Key word there is *remain*. That shows how bitcoin is the divergence, because in refusing to increase the block size, the very fundamentals of how bitcoin is used changed dramatically. The original community (and many newcomers like myself) see bitcoin cash and /r/btc as the continuation of the original community and project, and thus still feel an afinity for the name bitcoin. Even Satoshi's right hand man Gavin Andresen says it himself: [Bitcoin Cash is what I started working on in 2010: a store of value AND means of exchange.](https://twitter.com/gavinandresen/status/929377620000681984)"
"this sub it's called r/btc not r/bch, it serves the same purpose of r/bitcoin but actually allows discussions instead of banning dissention.

Of course there's a lot of bitcoin news when a bitcoin developer announces that merchant should use tabs instead of bitcoin..."
Why do we talk about BTC in r/btc? That's a puzzler, I have to admit.
It is called Bitcoin Cash. You can say it. BCH is the 'ticker' symbol some exchanges use.
This is a bitcoin sub. One that isn't censored. 
"You're asking why we say the things in, uncensored, /r/btc that we would want to say in /r/bitcoin but can't because they would be censored?

Seems like the answer is hidden in the question."
A two year old account that's posted only once, and that was a anti-Ver rant isn't likely to be a real person.
Who is ridiculing a direct approach?
"sub is run by the same folks as those pulling the strings at blockstream

a two year old could sort it out"
"You claimed someone said something that it turned out they didn't say. I'd call that a lie but perhaps you weren't brought up well enough to know the difference. Let's just call it an exaggeration then.

State and defend what you believe, that's fine. But don't claim shit that isn't true in order to advance your argument."
My two year old can string together a more coherent argument than you.
"Let's not be so quick to call someone a sockpuppet...

Not saying youre wrong but just because someone either has little/no karma or account age is low doesn't mean theyre a sockpuppet."
r/bitcoin is a forum owned by a private company called Reddit which appoints admins and moderators to run it. Bitcoin is a decentralised payments system owned by nobody. You are getting confused between the two.
