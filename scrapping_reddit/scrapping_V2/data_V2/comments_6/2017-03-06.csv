"I think some wallet automatically add dust change output to the fee. Of course this in turn makes the transaction smaller and the fee wouldn't have to be as large. So the algorithm might run in circles if not implemented well ;)"
But the problem is UTXOs that hold less BTC than the fee that would be needed *to include them in any transaction*.  Thus they cannot be included to pay fees either: that would increase the total fee by more than their amount.
But if you are making a transaction anyways, you can direct your change to the address with the dust (instead of a clean, never used address). This way you can collect your dust without paying any more than you would otherwise.
"Its hard to calculate UTXOs for me at the moment, I can calculate addresses.

The activation cycle is a pretty arbitrary thing. Maybe it resolves with a malleability fixing hard fork together with a 2MB block size increase but I would be more bullish if the r/btc shills would not succeed in messing with bitcoin and any hard fork before segWit would be a clear win for them and a loss for those who put their sweat and tears into bringing bitcoin forward since years."

More expensive.. if one need  to consolidate ouputs it might not be an option.
That's not how fee calculation works. It's escalated upwards by the maker of the transaction, not the miners.

For some transactions the fee is already 50 bucks.

I bought a few larger chunks.  My initial buys were in the $100s USD range but those are way up now on my wallet, and then I went larger after I saw how it worked.  
This post is meant to show you the non-linear growth of fees. The fees will come for you, too. Will you still think about loose change when the average TX fee is $100+?
the lesson would have been learned and future corporate take over would be far less likely to happen
Same here.
I want a wallet that warns me when a dust change is to be left in my wallet, so I can chose to add it to the fee if I like.
this is already the case- see for [example mycelium](https://github.com/mycelium-com/wallet/blame/master/public/bitlib/src/main/java/com/mrd/bitlib/TransactionUtils.java#L48) which had this logic since at least oct 7, 2013.  the dust value is harcoded to a lower bound though and not adjusted according to dynamic fee calculations
Clearly, Core are going all out to prevent this from ever happening.
That's not how bitcoin works - it costs bytes to claim an output - it doesn't matter if they all went to the same address.
Still a problem. It's about outputs
">Addresses with zero balances not counted on that page. 

Good, I would not want to count them for this metric.

> And 435.000 address with balance = 1 satoshi

That is some useful data. But, I personally think that even 1 satoshi should be spendable. "
Do you know how many UTXOs contain less than 20,000 satoshis?  And what the total amount of BTC adds up to in them?  That's the approximate point where they become unspendable if tx fees of 100 satoshis/byte are too low to ever confirm.
Thank you for clarifying the figures. It'd be interesting to be able to drill down further. As 0.00001 is now more than 1 US cent, that would be a good measurement to start a metric at. X addresses have between 0.00001-0.001 BTC. I'm not saying that anything less than 0.00001 doesn't count, but anything less than that is also not easily spent in fiat, either.
...at one level unhappy users will become a stark force. They'll at least run BU nodes, maybe even start mining BU. Plus they will demand others do the same. 
I've always been a defender of bitcoin against the gold bugs who claim that something must have an value as a commodity to be money. I've argued that efficiently and securely facilitating transactions is a value itself, and anything that does that can become money because people value it's features. There are now other cryptocurrencies that do that better than bitcoin and bitcoin isn't making changes quickly enough to out-compete them. That's why I'm not optimistic about bitcoin's future.
">Fees going up is not a bad sign for your holdings though. If people are willing to pay more for using Bitcoin then apparently there is something special about it.

That's partially true, but the increase is fees has diminished many use cases for bitcoin.  It could be doing so much better


>will get resolved mid term with segWit

If we're halfway through the activation cycle and struggling at 30% adoption, how do you see segwit activating?"
"There isn't.  It will fail miserably if they get their way.  Even themselves will find their pockets empty. 

We disagree on this one. "
"You're right. I didn't quite understand the fee scaling per byte. So basically there's a 44 byte overhead (destination address + 10 bytes) to every transaction. Then 180 +- 1 bytes per input address.

So with a fee of 0.0000020 per byte, any address with less than 0.0003636 would cost more to liquidate than it's worth.

Addresses with between 0.0003636 and 0.000452 can be spent if combined with enough other inputs to make the transaction economical."
"> The size of the recommended fee scales in proportion to the amount of inputs that a tx has.

Yes, the more inputs, the more witness data that's generated.  That's why segwit specifically discounts witness data; to deal directly with this issue.

> With regards to segwit, it would be foolish to attempt to predict fees on a technology that the market has, so plainly, demonstrated that it does not want (and will never activate). I base my conclusions within the scope of reality.

I'm not estimating what the fees will be.  I'm saying that the fees will be much less than non-segwit tx fees.  The more witness data (more inputs), the more heavily discounted the fee will be."
New buyers, higher bitcoin price, etc.
maybe with coinjoin or other privacy mechanism
"Demand could be rising for store-of-value users not demand for transactions.  If bitcoin is becoming digital gold (as it unfortunately seems to be because of the limit), then we'd see higher prices with fewer transactions.

Of course eventually that demand would increase to the point of requiring more transactions than fit in 1MB, but that's a separate issue."
"Fees are denominated in bitcoin but set by the miners.

If the miner currently thinks it costs him 1 cent per byte of transaction to process and store, then when Bitcoin's price increases by 10 he can lower his command line setting that sets that from 0.00001 BTC/byte to 0.000001 BTC/byte.

I don't disagree with your A and B conclusions -- but I don't think they affect what I was saying: as the value stored in those small-amount addresses becomes worth more, then suddenly miners will be willing to accept a proportion of that value (rather than all of it) to mine them."
"Before bitcoin fees reach 50 bucks per transaction, one or two other cryptocurrencies will have emerged as superior choices.

Start another thread when your hypotheses materialize, and I'll respond then."
there is probably no reason to panic just yet (if you bought in a few bigger chunks, as opposed to loads of tiny 1 usd amounts). Im actually pretty optimistic lately that we can turn bitcoin on the original path again. https://coin.dance/blocks/historical (the falling bitcoin core line is a good sign) Just maybe watch whats happening a bit more closely, so you you can bail out if things go sour.
Install either Bitcoin Unlimited or Bitcoin Classic. Then you will be ready to accept valid large blocks, and the extra real node will, in a small but real way,  help make miners more confident that they can safely make the change.
Big if true.
"Look into Monero; you'll be glad you did."
Same. Was looking into dash trying to see what it's all about. 
Takes over what? Bitcoin is a decentralized peer to peer electronic cash system. There shouldn't be anything to take over. The peers make up the value.
"That's weaksauce.   Ughh.. increasing the block size seems like such a great solution.  You could lower fees and miners could simply include more transactions and they would get more money... BTC would be cheap and fast and thereby gets used more ... literally everybody fucking wins.  

"
Takes over the network. The software is freely available to copy, but not the network, nor is software which is ran by the network easy to change. The peers do make up the value, and if they had half an ounce of sense, they would sell in favor of a network which hasn't been compromised, thus moving security and value from shitcoin to an actually usable currency. There are plenty of options. People who stay in Bitcoin are simply submitting to oppression at this point. By back AFTER shit gets fixed.
The TX rate will drop when the fees get too high, as BTC becomes worthless. So the fees won't rise forever, BTC can become irrelevant instead.

"> While that would probably be good for the share value in the short term, I would question long-term holding if it didn't adapt.

I know more than one restaurant that adapted, only to fall out of favor because the new, second floor was too much for the kitchen etc. I am fine with my favorite pizza place going out of business for hasty changes. I am not fine with bitcoin going out of business for hasty changes and very considerate changes are laid out and can pave the way for a bright future.

It will never succeed if it doesn't value much more than that it is worth now. And it will never gain value if it's not tremendously usable.

BTW, you are wrong about the government issuing money. They issue as much as they can to the extent that doesn't affect their holdings. They care shit about the currency you own. In fact, holding fiat currency is the most certain way of loosing money."

Thank you ... oh god.. am I about to shit myself.. cause I feel like this is probably going to make me sick. 
"What you said is a tautalogy: ""The TX volume will be lower because I think it will be lower, therefore it will be lower."" 

Historical data shows that the amount of on-chain transactions scales in relation to the price. There's only a certain amount of space in the blockchain, so it is not unreasonable to think that tx fees will become an exponential function of the price.

"
Doubling down on your foolishness, I see. :)
"> ""E-commerce"" alone is such a small market compared to other markets even in government issued currencies.

 Not sure if you're just trolling. E-comerce disrupted whole industries across countless business areas over the last two decades.  Century old companies have been thrown into death by the hand of online start ups. You cannot possibly be serious. "
"Oh well, looks like I'm wrong after all. Thanks for taking the time to explain!

I'm curious though, apart from easier validation, why is like this? Doesn't this bloat the blockchain unnecessarily?"
"Part of the reason may have been that Satoshi was thinking of modeling cash rather than bank accounts.  

But more likely it was just for technical simplicity.  Keeping track of the total amount in each address would have required more code, and maybe opened up some security risks.  It would also have encouraged reuse of addresses, which weakens privacy (as Satoshi himself noted).  Requiring each UTXO to be listed and signed separately in the inputs was definitely simpler to implement."
[deleted]
"yes totally serious, total e-commerce in 2016 was nearly 400 billion, which is less than the daily volume in most financial markets.

trade between currencies has a multi trillion daily volume as an example, and excludes the wildly popular equities markets. on an annual basis these eclipse e-commerce by several orders of magnitude. focusing on cryptographic token transferring because of ""micropayments""  ""developing countries"" and eventually seeing how it sucks for any of that has very little to do with the success of the experiment, because its outstanding utility in other use cases will continue to drive scarcity much much faster."
"When Bitcoin was designed eight years ago, this wasn't considered 'bloat', it was considered accurate accounting: one spent coin requires one signature to demonstrate the right to spend. This is more important than you might think, because Bitcoin addresses are not simply destinations, but actually cryptographic challenges. A common 1xxxx address is simply a ""human friendlier"" way of representing ""this coin can be spent with a signature that meets a basic cryptographic challenge"", while 3xxxx addresses are more complex scripts (e.g. ""this coin can be spent with a combination of any two signatures that individually meet any of these three cryptographic challenges"" = 2-of-3 multisig).

The issue arises when using one signature to meet multiple challenges (i.e. eliminating the bloat). While it's technically possible there are additional caveats that negatively impact the cryptographic security of the model. These challenges are not insurmountable, but they were not part of the original design - it was (and maybe still is) more sensible to require each output be independently signed for, since this is a layer of complication that affords no utility, and simply shifts complexity from one step to another. (Simpler to sign once, more complex to repetitively validate)

Another interesting corner case that complicates the issue: what about scripts that have multiple solutions (back to the multisig example)? If multiple coins are sent to a script with multiple solutions, those coins could be spent with different solutions to the challenge - totally different signatures entirely, despite being the same address - and, since they exist in such a form, *must* support this behavior to function correctly (and prevent loss of funds!)"
Try saying it out loud, with a pause, or without the pause. You might find yourself liking the comma.
Once again, thanks for explaining! That makes sense
"Correct but incomplete. You now have *two* inputs at D, which means spending the (0.5 - fee + 0.001) from D will cost a fee that is twice as expensive as either of these transactions. The cost of spending the dust doesn't go away because it can be combined; it still has to be signed for and the signature still consumes data in a transaction."
Please see my response to /u/Peewee223 below/above
"No, you are not understanding me. I have
 
 - address A with 1 BTC
 - address D with 0.001 BTC (D as in dust)
 - address C with 0 BTC (C as in change, my next generated change address)

I'm purchasing a very expensive cup of coffee for 0.5BTC from Bob (with address B). So instead of doing

    Transaction: A->B (0.5btc), A->C (0.5btc minus fee)

as my Electrum wallet would recommend me, I'm doing

    Transaction: A->B (0.5btc), A->D (0.5btc minus fee)

So I now have 0 on A, (0.5 - fee + 0.001) on D, and 0 on C. No dust. See?

This for the cost of one fee, which I was going to spend anyways to make the coffee-buy transaction.

If you don't want to spend all your bitcoins on one address, you have to include a change address, even if it's the sending address. Using your dust address instead does not make the transaction any bigger.

That's what wallets already do (at least mycelium and schildbach)
"Good point; the optimal fee can potentially be more than double the required amount for that transaction, even though lower than double of the fee you would be paying with a change output.
"
that's the kind of cross UX/protocol discussions we'll have at https://s3nd.org/
"... That's still not how bitcoin works. A bitcoin address isn't an account number - to spend bitcoin, you must prove where you got it from. The way you do that is by signing each individual output you want to use.

Let's say an address has accumulated 0.01 BTC from 10 change transactions of 0.001, and let's say the change transactions are called A-J.

What you're imagining is something like:

""I own 1CHANGEADDRESS with 0.01 in it (signature). I'd like to send 0.009 to 1DUMMYADDRESS and pay a fee of 0.001.""

It's actually communicated like this:

""I can spend 0.001 from A (signature). I can spend 0.001 from B (signature). I can spend 0.001 from C (signature). I can spend 0.001 from D (signature). I can spend 0.001 from E (signature). I can spend 0.001 from F (signature). I can spend 0.001 from G (signature). I can spend 0.001 from H (signature). I can spend 0.001 from I (signature). I can spend 0.001 from J (signature). I'd like to send 0.009 to 1DUMMYADDRESS, and pay a fee of 0.001.""

Obviously that takes extra data to communicate, and so you pay a higher fee than you would if you were just spending from one output. It doesn't make any difference if the dust is in the same address or not."
"Except you would be paying more. Each output you spend is bytes in a transaction, and each byte in a transaction is fees.

More unspent outputs in the same address => more data to sign for them all => bigger fees."
No, as Peewee223 said: the cost to spend is per output, not per address.
I didn't wait for bitcoin to meet those arbitrary metrics before I started using it. Not sure why I would wait for a competitor to do so.

"The harm is that some people have lots of loose change?

With Bitcoin, fees are charged based on the number of 'coins' you spend, not the total amount. So when fees are so high that spending coins held in more than 50% of the available address is a bit odd, don't you think?

In business there are many types of people, but among leadership there tends to be type 1 and type 2.  Type 1 are the innovators that create new things, create value, ect.  Then when they get bored and leave, type 2 comes along, turning whatever type 1 said into a religion, making the present systems they inherited into dogmas about ideal operation, when type 1 always knew it was just one method of getting the job done.

Type 2 people are great at maintaining stability for well operated systems.  They are great people to run insurance companies for example, because the business model was figured out 100 years ago and hasn't really changed.  Type 2 people in charge when there needs to be a radical change?  Bad for everyone involved."

"This is worrying; but it's important to note that it's only true at current prices.

If bitcoin were worth 10x more we'd expect the fees to be 10x less (priced in bitcoin), if all other things were equal (i.e. no increase in demand because of the price increase).

The satoshi/per byte parameter would drop as price went up making lots of ""dust"" become not-dust again."
Relax, wait for segwit and ln
I'll be wishing the muppets on this sub hadn't opposed Segwit.
You can pay the transaction fee once, but the tx size grows with the amount of inputs you have, and so will the fee.
"Ditch the dirty fiat! End the fed!

Benefits of using Bitcoin:

~~No fees~~

~~Instant~~

~~Secure~~

~~Stable~~

~~Untraceable~~

Magic internet money"
"Time for them to use their BTC to buy a cryptocurrency with lower fees.

When my savings can be quantified in dimes I'll have bigger things to worry about than fees."
Need I remind you that NONE Of this is Blockstream / Core's fault and this is an inherent design flaw in the original implementation of bitcoin. The way users talk on here you would think that Blockstream has a monopoly on the transaction fees and are siphoning them for themselves..oh WAIT - that's what the CHINESE MINERS ARE DOING BY NOT IMPLEMENTING SEGWIT.
"$1-3 is not really savings..... no matter where u are in the world.

If those are ur savings you shouls not waste your time with bitcoins"
Why does it matter anyway? Bitcoin is not supposed to be transferred, it's a STORE of value.
Yay, finally someone else realized this. Blockstream bitcoin is a pyramid scheme. 
Wow! that is brutally true. Those people won't touch their coins because it is not worth it. Supply is eaten up a little bit by this. bitcoin is getting really risky. I am considering just selling all my coins. But on the other hand, there is huge potential for valuation if we break free of blockstream.
"In a previous post I made on the subject a redditer found out than there was 3600BTC of uneconomical outputs in the UTXO set.

It is $4 million dollars if fees stay at that level!!"
Hold on , you are not looking at the big picture here... if i have 10 adresses with .00something what stops me to use the 10 priv keys associated to those 10 adresses and make one single transaction with 10 inputs and only 1 output and pay the transaction fee only once?
"They aren't unspendable, people are still spending them:

Total: 0.00006 BTC

Fees: 0.0002 BTC"
"~~They aren't unspendable. You just have to include fees from another address.~~

~~That's the kind kind of ""FUD"" we don't need to spread. There are enough real issues, we don't have to make any more up.~~

Edit: Forget it, I just messed something up in my head.        "
Not really unspendable. It looks like many are change addresses that would be combined to create a larger transaction.
"As a newbie, what can I do to help this situation?


I have some basic knowledge and could probably figure out how to run a node or donate to start some nodes."
"With the fees as high as they are it becomes worthless to make any transfer. Of course this depends on your balance size but still remains true for medium to high balance holders. 

This can't go on much longer without seeing devistating reprecussions. 

I am kinda glad I am not out of BTC"
The proper way to calculate this would be annoying. txid+index+signature would be valid for most utxos with a regular address. for p2sh constuctions, the size of the redeemscript/sigscript could be a lot. Maybe we should seperate signatures and increase the blocksize a bit. :)
I don't see it OP. According to your own sources, 55.2% of addresses contain 0.001 BTC or less, however acceptable fees are around like 0.0001 BTC per tx, so just a tenth of balance needed for what counted into that percentage of wallets you used. Plus a large part of these addresses are probably leftovers with zero or close to zero balance, which means they don't matter.
All I know is I boarded this train under the impression that fees were going to be so minute we would forget them.
So, 55% of UTXO is now occupied with dust?  
"This 1000x.

"
Probably somewhere in the Great Lakes region.
It's actually probably a lot worse than that.  Many addresses have multiple outputs.  Addresses with low value and multiple outputs are also unspendable.  And I don't want to think about how much money will be wasted when the address with 17K bitcoins, but 14K outputs gets used/consolidated.  There's a good chance a significant portion of that is unspendable.
"These addresses wouldn't be unspendable if Bitcoin price were 1000x higher, and Bitcoin fees were 1000x lower.

This economic disaster was totally avoidable - and it is directly the blame of Core/Blockstream/[AXA](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin+btc/search?q=axa).

We can easily fix this - by rejecting Core/Blockstream/[AXA](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin+btc/search?q=axa)'s crippled code and centrally planned blocksize (which is artificially suppressing the price and artificially increasing the fees) - and use code which supports market-based blocksize as originally designed by Satoshi (eg, Bitcoin Unlimited):

> Bitcoin Original: Reinstate Satoshi's original 32MB max blocksize. If actual blocks grow 54% per year (and price grows 1.54^2 = 2.37x per year - Metcalfe's Law), then in 8 years we'd have 32MB blocks, 100 txns/sec, 1 BTC = 1 million USD - 100% on-chain P2P cash, without SegWit/Lightning or Unlimited

https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5uljaf/bitcoin_original_reinstate_satoshis_original_32mb/"
"That's not an accurate assessment. How many of those addresses in the 0-0.001 are actually 0? 

I think a fairer assessment would be: ""0.01% of Bitcoin is now unmovable due to fees"". Or ""1600BTC is locked in addresses that can't be moved without spending more than their balance to transfer them.""

Sure, the titles aren't as sensational, but at least they're accurate.

Either way, a fee of 0.001BTC is unacceptable in this peer-to-peer electronic cash system."
Yeah so a few of my unspent outputs are around 0.001. So a dollar is dust... Try telling that to someone in Cambodia.
all the faucet coins are gone...
Funnily enough I'm now de-incentivized to merge many small UTXO's into one, which would reduce the UTXO set.
We really need to focus on supporting the BU team and getting the miners and the users ready for the BU / Core fork. This is just ridiculous. Segwit / Core is an altcoin built for bankers, we need to leave them behind ASAP.
Bitcoin is starting to suck. I'm about to give up on it at this point as it's almost no different then using Western Union.
"Casual subscriber here.

ELI5, please:

How high are fees?

How are fees set/why are they so high?

What can be done about this?  Will the problem be resolved?"
Bitcoin has always been a pyramid scheme.. it's deflationary by nature and rewards go down.  The earlier you adopt the better off you are.
Obviously those are all just spam addresses. /s
I thought it was 3 cents.. what year is it and where am I?
Out of curiosity is it possible to tell if and how many of these addresses are colored coins (which represent something of presumably great enough value to warrant the transaction fee)
"I wouldn't call $1 ""savings"", but yeah, the trend is alarming."
"This is a very good point. I hope the are all paper wallets. ;-) 

While somewhat alarming, we need to keep in mind that this forces these coins into long-term holding, and doesn't necessarily remove them from circulation forever. 

It is yet another critical issue though. Has anyone presented this to /r/Bitcoin? 

edit: It's not much unlike the US Stock market, where laws artificially inflate the stock market by forcing people to hold funds in 401k's, Roth's, etc... until they are of retirement age."
Consolidate your dust - http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/34281/is-there-an-easy-way-to-consolidate-dust-microtransactions
"This doesn't really mean anything. Coins don't become unspendable because the fees are more than the amount in any one address, because a single transaction with a single fee can take inputs from multiple addresses.

Don't get me wrong, the fees are ridiculous and I've been liquidating bitcoin because I'm not optimistic about it's future because of the fees. But I've been liquidating lots of small change addresses, bundled into one transaction and paid one fee to empty all those addresses."
"So I've been casually following this.

My understanding was you didn't need a fee if your btc tx was sufficiently large enough.    Is this still true?

For those ""unspendable"" coins.. couldn't you just deposit more BTC in the address then move it elsewhere? I did this a few years ago without problems.  "
"Why do you ignore that a tx can have many inputs?

Obviously, don't make a tx contain a single input if the value is lower than the fee.  Combine it with another high value input into a new address.

On top of that, segwit will heavily discount witness data, so creating a segwit tx with lots of inputs, requiring lots of witness data, will be much much cheaper."
These users won't even be able to open an LN channel. BitcoinCore has rendered these amounts unusable.
Consolidate your transactions into one address. Same thing as why would you don't use 10 different banks ATMs to take out $20 and pay the fee each time. You use one ATM and take one fee. 
"better start aggregating your small outputs while tx fees are still low.

reduces privacy, but also reduces UTXO set size... a double-edged sword."
I am starting to think we need blockstream core and unlimited devs to agree to support each other blockchains as sidechains. Or we might reach a new milestone where blockstream and unlimited continues to battle over continuously less worth bitcoin. There is not much time till we abadon bitcoin for good.
You mean where WAS I, right? I couldnt tell you. All I know is that, until i get some more BTC, i cant use any of my XCP or tokens.
"I'm of the opinion ion that fees per transaction will ultimately be orders of magnitude lower (in btc terms). But, isnt' what you are describing ultimately one facet of the ""deflationary"" part of bitcoin?"

">  that Blockstream has a monopoly on the transaction fees and are siphoning them for themselves.

This is not actually the case but according to a blockstream shareholder this is definitely the goal. "
"> because a single transaction with a single fee can take inputs from multiple addresses

But each input increases the transaction size in bytes, which increases the fee."
On top of that, segwit will heavily discount witness data, so creating a segwit tx with lots of inputs, requiring lots of witness data, will be much much cheaper.
"You need a fee regardless of the amount of Bitcoin in the unspent output. Right now, the recommended size of the fee is greater than a huge number unspent outputs (50%+ of all Bitcoin Addresses with a balance). 

Bitcoin is fungible. Let's say you pay for the fee (example: $0.50) with another output. You still ""lost"" an amount of money greater than the amount in the original unspent output that had less than $0.50 worth of Bitcoin."
"The size of the recommended fee scales in proportion to the amount of inputs that a tx has.

With regards to segwit, it would be foolish to attempt to predict fees on a technology that the market has, so plainly, demonstrated that it does not want (and will never activate). I base my conclusions within the scope of reality."
"The problem is the number and size of inputs. ""Address balances"" are just an abstraction on top of the protocol, they don't really exist."
"For ""uneducated readers"", a warning is in order then:

Be *very* careful when consolidating your change transactions or other dust, because it will diminish your privacy considerably. Especially if you are not using different wallets for different purposes. But even then, keep in mind that you will be provably associating your transactions.

> these opportunities will become rare and may disappear

As stated in another comment, wallets will continue to produce change that is below the fee threshold, so what we call dust will have to adjust.

The only opportunity I see here is sending dust to addresses you are ""interested"" in. Then analyze the data when users consolidate these transactions.
"
[deleted]
Consolidation is bad for privacy.. but as the situation is really unknown it might be a safe move.
who takes over after blockstream?
"Where is this mythical ""low fee"" period of which you speak? I have not seen one in a week."
"Fees are denominated in bitcoin though, so that doesn't make sense. The only way to make fees go down right now is to 

A - decrease demand (push people off to other chains / level 2 solutions) 

B - increase supply (blocksize increase) 

Or I suppose C - fiddle with the fee calculation method (segwit discount)  "
"Create a problem
Propose a solution
Are you a democrat!"
The market is opposing segwit. Reddit has very little to do with it.
"I have bitcoin on a blockstream wallet.  What should I do here?  I don't know where to begin.  

My wealth has increased substantially since I began, but I don't really pay attention.  Is it time to sell about half and buy a house or some land or something tangible?  

I don't read up but I keep seeing posts about blockchain and block sizes, which means higher fees?  I won't be able to sell without losing all my money in fees? 

"
"That bitinfocharts site uses address balance, not UTXO amounts.  So if an address had 10 UTXOs and each one is only 10,000 satoshis, then the address balance is 0.001 BTC.  Which would make it seem spendable but in reality it's not because signing 10 inputs makes the transaction too large to be confirmed for a fee less than 0.001 BTC.  And some addresses with a large balance will have some small unspendable UTXOs so their real spendable balance is actually less.

So what I'm saying is that in reality there are far more unspendable coins than 1600.  But I haven't analyzed the UTXO set to know exactly how many.  "
$1-3 is savings for a lot of people in unbanked populations of the world, i.e. the people that Bitcoin could help the most.
I wouldn't oppose SW if it wasn't such a bad idea. 
Let's say Bitcoin fees continue to grow non-linearly, and they become $50 per average transaction. Let's say Bitcoin does a 10x bubble again, and fees are now $500. Do you still not care?
The original design of Bitcoin did not have a 1mb block limit.
Learn what implement means.
says every fund manager, ever, and yet mine drive an A8. Fucker.
Fees going up is not a bad sign for your holdings though. If people are willing to pay more for using Bitcoin then apparently there is something special about it. And knowing that fees will go down again, with LN probably to virtually zero, you can anticipate an explosion of use and use cases in the future. This fee drama is only temporary and will get resolved mid term with segWit, with bigger blocks and eventually both.
"> But on the other hand, there is huge potential for valuation if we break free of blockstream.

I agree. Huge."
Is this similar to change in the clothes dryer, or couch?  What's the harm in some loose change not being spent?
"Which would never be a problem if people didn't reuse addresses

Self fulfilling prophecy "
There is also potential for valuation if we continue the core roadmap, which includes bigger blocks, off-chain transactions which should reduce on-chain fees, and things like schnorr signatures which can make those kinds of UTXOs spendable. Really, anything but perpetual gridlock is likely to be good.
"Well, you could use the address with dust as change address (disregarding privacy), thus ""save"" the dust.

*Edit: looks like I'm wrong after all! Comment retracted. If you are not sure why, read /u/Peewee223 "
It's not dust if the goal is to have 1 bit equal $1
Some of those are probably not really dust. For example, the 1 satoshi addresses are likely to be used for things like colored coins, document hashes, or other non-currency uses. 
"Addresses with zero balances not counted on that page. There are more than 217.000.000 bitcoin addresses with zero balance.
And 435.000 addresses with balance = 1 satoshi"
Agreed, I'd love to see statistics about the ratio of unmovable btc. Still, the number of useless UTXO-s is relevant as well, for scaling reasons if nothing else.
Right. They're essentially underwater. And they're not going to get a bailout unless scaling is resolved. 
"Furthermore, AFAIK there is no mechanism that prevents you from producing ""dust"" in the form of change. If we assume wallets will not consume this dust against the interests of their users, this will be yet another factor that continuously increases the UTXO set.
"
Of course addresses with zero are excluded. If 45% of wallets already had more than zero coins, bitcoin would be worthless. 100% (to lots of SF) of addresses have zero bitcoins in them.
"Funny enough, miners can reduce their UTXO set by just forgetting your dust UTXOs ;)"
"The problem is Dust apply to larger and larger outputs (in BTC)

Leading people to lost money due to uneconomical outputs (fee too expensive to use such outputs)"
You joke, but actual spam addresses would hold about the minimum amount possible, so the spammer could create as many of them as he could for as little as possible.
Risky how? Maybe risky to explain to plebs but it sounds like a good investment at the right amounts 
I'll be there as well, with OP's mom.
Ladies and gentlement, two Antpool BU blocks in a row. This is something significant today. AntPool has about 16% of the hash rate currently, which would bring BU up to 38%. So close to the majority share if that happens.

That's why we need to wait for the next 24 hours to really see what the situation is.

"Wow, people really misunderstood what you were asking.

USAF: User-activated-soft-fork. The idea is that if all nodes on the network upgrade to segwit, then the miners would be ""forced"" to upgrade as well. In reality, this concept is horribly flawed:

* This isn't a soft fork. What the fuck?
* You can't have transactions without miners.
* Okay, lets say 25% (currently segwit voting) miners and 80% of the current nodes participate in this coup attempt
* The other 75% of the network + major exchanges actually wouldn't be affected. They would operate as normal. You would be able to buy and sell bitcoins on Coinbase, transactions would go through.
* Meanwhile, on the 25% hashrate chain, transactions would be hella slow due to high difficulty. And it wouldn't be clear if you can exchange those ""bitcoins"" for cash, since exchanges might not support them

In effect, this is user-activated-hard-fork. It's also a really dumb plan."
that's all organic user/node growth. /s
Let the sybill attack begin.
Likely. They have a history of shifting the goalposts in ever more desperate fashion, and it has worked for them so far. Eventually reality strikes, though.
Because at $10,000, my bitcoin stash would be an uncomfortable percentage of my net worth and I'd want to divest a little. I wouldn't sell all of them, but a decent amount makes sense. I can't see it rising as high as $10,000 without a major crash to $6,000ish, so maybe I'd buy some back if that happened.
"> Core needs to be fired for their mishandling of Bitcoin and terrible leadership. 

I would say that Core *leadership* needs to be fired (specifically Maxwell and his clique).

Big trap. A hard fork won't come with it's lot of pain. It will probably be a price setback for a year or two has people lose confidence, until they see it is for the better and come back big. 
"shaolinfry is a Bitcoin Core sockpuppet
"
Eat them already. They will just grow fungus otherwise
"Cheap coins here we come! I'm also excited about being able to trade both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Classic. We will basically have double the bitcoins!!!

EDIT: I didn't even mention my ETH and Monero holdings. Those are gonna skyrocket!!! I'm so excited guys!"
AntPool is updating all nodes to Unlimited. It will take a while to do as such and yes some are in the USA and different nations.
If you consider SegWit supporters a small group you are delusional
"A chance to increase the blocksize, reduce fee's, on-board more users and increase the value. 

It will also prove that as a community we can successfully hard fork when required. "
So does that mean the third server has yet to update, or is it being run independently?
It's time for you to climb into this gif and get squished little stick man!
According the whitepaper miners are in full control of bitcoin. Maybe you should read it again?
"You

Sound

Scared"
Yeh it looks like they only have BU running on their Beijing servers right now.
"In the coinbase of the third block it says ""Mined by AntPool usa"". So I assume it is running on a different server.

https://blockchain.info/tx/60c3f43b13966426de2e73aa1966eda7f1a95b2469e3815c8a17d1f47ff8bac9"
Antpool has various servers around the world. You can see the various servers in their coinbase messages.
"there is a different coinbase string.  I am are guessing that means that antpool is running a distributed pool -- that is they have distributed mining centers and each center may use their own block generation software.  So maybe the antpool usa3 center hasn't enabled BU signaling yet...  Note the above is entirely speculation :-)
"
We all win, We get segwit , you get large blocks that are controlled by miners. Cheers. 
Agreed , Chaos is bad short term for bitcoin but there are plenty of profits to be made and bitcoin may do fine in the longterm regardless. 
"I'm genuine ...because while there are many trolls here supporting r/Btc , there are some longterm bitcoin holders that also are feeling trapped andin pain with the direction we are headed. I want them to be happy with their altcoin. 
"
"> I must admit that I won't be doing this. 

Some advice: you have to bet 100% , if not BU coin is doomed to fail in the coin vote and the miners will rush back to the original chain. This is the only hope you have for your coin.

I will not be hedging my bets and will immediately dump 100% of BUforked coins to insure miners get a clear signal. "
">It isn't a matter of opinion, The original chain is the one that doesn't hard fork

It isn't a matter of opinion. Thanks for the laugh.

If it is not a matter of opinion, is Gavin's definition wrong? :-)

If not, why not, how does that fit?

I have seen guys like Aaron van Wirdum argue that the github.com/bitcoin repository is the anchor point for what is the true chain.

Is he wrong?"
You assume I care at all about your ideology re: the health of bitcoin. My comment is not flawed, I sincerely hope you pull all of your available resources and bet them on your ideas.  I must admit that I won't be doing this.  
"> I have to admit , not exactly sacrificing much as I have already profited greatly over the years.... and you assume that I value monetary profit over the health and well being of bitcoin which is another flaw in your comment.

Monetary profit and health and well-being of the network are  aligned. It is interesting that you still don't get this after all this fighting.

I wonder whether I should sense bitterness, an empty, laughable threat (we'll sell all of the big blocks coins!1!) or a genuine farewell address from your comments.

The good side in me wants to see the latter, the realist cynic in me sees one or both of the former. In any case, I don't care too much."
Do you think that's just because they haven't been able to update simultaneously, or are they under separate management? If Antpool goes 100% BU it'll be huge.
"You do make an interesting point. Core supporters may very well have more coins than BU supporters, since many BU supporters have traded at least some of their holdings for altcoins.

And miners definitely will follow whatever chain is more profitable.

I think two separate bitcoin chains, both exchange-traded would be a super interesting event. Miners at least initially will probably want to mine 50%/50% on each chain, so confirmation times don't explode. The market can't resolve its preference unless both coins are trading with liquidity.

The other interesting factor is altcoins: since the most liquid markets are paired with bitcoin last time I checked, two bitcoins crashing in price could pump alts to higher than bitcoin prices. And then exchanges would also have to decide in btc pairs which bitcoin to actually use.

It would be chaos. But I like chaos, since there are good profit opportunities."
"And shake off bad actors.

Also, I think a successful HF would mean that the miners are properly on their toes and we can go back to a less politicized, more sane and calm environment.
"
Actually with 25% it would take 8 weeks or so. 56 days. This makes the assumption that no hashrate joins the majority chain during that time.
You nuts bro? China has every incentive to block privacy improvements to Bitcoin. Jihan and BU is their hand puppet. LOL
Because it is antithetical to nakamoto consensus and is anti-bitcoin. It throws in the bin everything we have learnt the past 8 years about incentives that work, just so that a small group of people can stamp their feet and get their way.
"Because they probably don't work? Miners secure the network, and are required for transactions to happen. Economic nodes, like the ones running at Kraken and Coinbase allow for a cryptocurrency to have liquidity -- so their vote matters too.

Some amount of nodes will upgrade. Nowhere near enough to force the miners/exchanges and network as a whole to upgrade. Remember that there are already almost 1000 BU nodes that won't be voting this way.

The only way a USAF like this could work is if all the exchanges + users colluded against the miners, coupled with a proof-of-work change as well."
"User Activated Soft Fork

Do some Googling but [this is what I found](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/5xoysv/how_user_activated_soft_forks_uasf_work_and_why/) straight away, not sure if it's what you need"
It is a way Core has devised to completely disregard Nakamoto consensus and just get what will make their egos feel good. It makes them complete hypocrits like everyone here already knows since all they've been pushing for years is 'consensus'... but it was always clear what they really meant was 'just agreeing with Core'

"> The 1MB chain with 25% hashrate will need 40 days for difficulty retarget.

You are assuming the outcome of the final coin vote. There will be speculative attacks where exchanges profit greatly off of both sides dumping their split coins on each other. I believe we will win the majority miners hashrate back in the first day or two but I certainly could be wrong(and I am fine with this). If you assume to know the outcome you are being dishonest with yourself or naive. 

We already are prepared with various solutions if the coinvote doesn't go our way. 

"
No thats not how it works. Besides the list of exchanges supporting SegWit is significant. Gemini, Coinbase, Bitfinex. I suspect more will voice their support the longer it takes for miners to signal.
LOL.
Will this be the biggest shakeout in bitcoin's history?  Will this cleave all the ideological hardliners from the economic consensus?  Very exciting.
I just didn't know what UASF meant
"I actually like this plan, because it would end the blocksize war.

What they don't understand is that the hashrate is the best metrics about economic majority, not a good one, but the best we have. Therefore it seems very likely their fork would fail miserably."
"Wow... That is entertainingly stupid. I want them to do it. How can we persuade them to do it. Will be better than watching people buying mark kerpeles frapinos. 

Stashing pop corn...."
Megabyte size limit?
They heard that the max block size was going to be decreased to 300KB, so they decided to spin up nodes on their 486's with 14.4k modems.
"miners would crush core if it came to ""node attack.""  Nodes are like chump change compared to cost of being a miner."
Yes. The new thing is PON (proof of nodes), lol!
Oh makes sense. :-) I guess I'm just crazy for not wanting to sell even at those prices
Yes, I can agree with that. Usually I specify the leadership. Unfortunately it is hard to just get rid of just them. It is not like we can boot the bad CEO or something, haha.

I didn't actually do the math before posting, but it's funny that it does work out.  It just shows how insane the small-blocker argument is from a technical standpoint.  Anyway, thanks for doing the (very amusing) math on that :)
"shaolinfry is one of the main contributor of Litecoin and the one that is pushing segwit USAF over at litecoin with coblee.

He is most likely and asshole but he is not a sock-puppet."
I agree with the exception that the agitators are merely core supporters.
Core has been making many changes to make Bitcoin unusable in the sense that it cannot function as described in the whitepaper with a constant, growing backlog. This is obviously to either stay in a position of power or line their investors pockets where they plan to monetize off a second payer solution because it will be impossible with a 1mb block limit in the face of adoption.
What is the link between Core and UASF?
I never understood why BU isnt applauding user activated soft forks
"If you find a safe way to trade coins before the split I'd like to see you put your money where your mouth is. :) But I'm pretty sure, that most core followers have a feeling somewhere in their brain, that they might have been suffering from Stockholm syndrome the whole time.. So I guess we won't see that.

> Sincerely wish you happiness and luck on your journey. 

Likewise! :)"
"China would be a lot less harmed by a successful Bitcoin than the U.S.

Just a thought.
"
Certainly looks that way. They also might be doing the roll-out in stages over a few days just to monitor how things go. 
"The original chain activating Segwit will likely have a high degree of miner centralization, and segwit coins will be vulnerable to being spent by any miner with >51% hashrate on the crippled chain. 

CoreChain will transform from something trustless into something where users are literally trusting their miner to not steal all of their segwit UTXOs."
The 1MB chain with 25% hashrate will need 40 days for difficulty retarget.
And a good day to you too, sir!
You should be careful, by selling one side and buying another you expose yourself to betting incorrectly.  I mean this sincerely.
You're right, I got those confused. I want to get rid of my Corecoins.
"> but I am technical enough to spot the mistakes within

Rather: Oblivious to the difference between technical mistakes and language-based propaganda and redefining of terms at will.

And that you cite Cobra with his attempt to change the whitepaper is the last step that was needed in getting clown status here.

"Actually i win because I get valuable Bitcoins while you fork off into a coin that will be worthless or very close to.

The debate is over.
This is the beginning of the snowball effect. Mark my word. 
What percentage does BU need?
I think the goal should not be majority 50%, but more like 75% voting, this would be a pretty decisive victory and no one could complain much about it.
"It's good that Antpool also have chosen ""EB1/AD6"" like the other big Bitcoin Unlimited mining pools. That means that almost everyone agrees that the hard fork method that Viabtc suggested is the best of all hard fork methods. That means that there's unlikely to be any bike shedding. "
They also mined the next block. Does anyone know how to read if they have signalled for BU? coin.dance and nodecounter.com haven't updated yet.
"3rd block isn't unlimited, seems like it's a ""warning"" for Core

Interesting times ahead for sure"
Best news all week! Hopefully it only gets better! Thanks AntPool, you are making history!
Great news - we can start the long road towards real solutions.  Whilst BU may or may not be the final path taken, I think it is important to prove that we can say no to Blockstream/Core.  I do respect the great work done by many in this org.  However, it is more important to demonstrate that this technology cannot and will not be co-op'ed by any one group - regardless of who/what they are in the space. 
F2Pool and BW probably aren't far behind I would think.  They probably want to see how things go from here for a bit.
Yes! Their next block is also BU!

Three Bitcoin Unlimited blocks so far from bj (Beijing?) and two non BU from usa: https://www.blocktrail.com/BTC/pool/antpool
"Just when I was giving up on Bitcoin.

Good man Jihan!"
Not only that but BU show a steady increase since release... I just hope more pools will join up!! Victory is ours!
"Yes, Satoshi did write this in the section on Proof-of-Work. But the ""majority decision"" under discussion was the limited one of which chain represents the true ledger (as opposed to one mined by attackers trying to roll back blocks):

> If a majority of CPU power is controlled by honest nodes, the honest chain will grow the fastest and outpace any competing chains.  To modify a past block, an attacker would have to redo the proof-of-work of the block and all blocks after it and then catch up with and surpass the work of the honest nodes.  We will show later that the probability of a slower attacker catching up diminishes exponentially as subsequent blocks are added.

It took the later insite of Prof Stofli to see that such voting need not be so limited to such issues, but can control all rules of the network. Hence lives Verlimited BlockChain at last! True Satoshi Vision lives!"
Ah yes, glad we share at least something. I'm not really sure why most people have a price they'd sell if they're in bitcoin for the long term. The goal is never having to sell for fiat. :-)
It looks like the Bitcoin Unlimited blocks came from servers in China?, the non BU block was from a server in USA. It could be that not all of their servers have been updated yet, only time will tell, an official statement would obviously be desirable.
"Quite a few on rBitcoin actually did take it serious. I think that (plus all the history of this 'debate') also showed Jihan and others who's to be taken serious and who's not.
"
"Lets give it a go. In the trader community like Whalepool and tradingview people are overwhelmingly in support of SegWit. On twitter there seems to be overwhelming support for SegWit. Nodes are in whelming support for segwit. Buisnesses are in overwhelming support of SegWit. Developers are in overwhelming support. Etc.

"
#IT'S SO OBVIOUS JIHAN AND ROGER ARE SQUIRMING OVER UASF! LOL
"One thing I must say: Your style of trolling is at least unique. And very direct: ""blah blah blah blah"".

:-)"
what was the UASF talk?

Congratulations /u/Jihan_Bitmain
"This IS big.

Any solo-miner remaining that mine today with Unlimited, I suggest aligning with Antpool and ViaBTC with EB1/AD6. I just did the change myself right now."
"I didn't say shitcoin , altcoin isn't necessarily a pejorative , as I may be forced to HF if the coin vote isn't in my favor and I join an altcoin as well :-)

The Core Usurper Devs are poison regardless of what code they are trying to push. Such atrocious behavior, terrible leadership, trolling of the public, would lead to a quick firing in a typical business situation. But with Bitcoin we are trapped until people act. Antpool thank you for acting!

High praise to Antpool and Jihan Wu! Finally, they have seen the light and hopefully the 2 years of blocksize increase/scaling debate will be settled. Core/Blockstream effed up big time!
"3rd BU block from Antpool was just mined. Looks like it's just a staged rollout and the ""Antpool usa"" nodes haven't been updated yet.

https://blockchain.info/block-height/456058"
lmao although you are wrong.  /r/bitcoin won't react at all because they won't have any clue. 
"That is the best thing I've read in two years. Thank you, Antpool, for finally growing a fucking spine and fighting for the integrity of this very important project.

Now I will get my popcorn out while /r/borgstream loses their collective shit

"
Maybe the smear campaign and FUD against Jihaan Wu finally pushed antpool over the edge. Or the threat of UASF.
"Not exactly. This is part of ViaBTC hardfork plan.

"Read this: https://medium.com/@ViaBTC/miner-guide-how-to-safely-hard-fork-to-bitcoin-unlimited-8ac1570dc1a8

Remaining at EB1/AD6 is the optimal strategy until BU has a supermajority."
The reason for using EB1/AD6 is written up here: https://medium.com/@ViaBTC/miner-guide-how-to-safely-hard-fork-to-bitcoin-unlimited-8ac1570dc1a8
