I guess educating yourself isn't interesting to you. No worries.
That's not what we were discussing, and the way it works is completely different. Hence you not understanding how the blockchain works. Satoshi is right that mining become somewhat more centralized as the network grows, but mining nodes don't hold people money, they mine and verify the blockchain. LN nodes hold money and work completely differently.
Nope. On a blockchain, ALL inputs and outputs go through ALL the full nodes, some of which are miners. 
I see what you're saying now but actually think it's be more ideal if he didn't actually believe such garbage. Either way, I'm glad to hear I misunderstood and that you're not supporting his trash opinions.

"Except you don't need to use their lightning hubs. You can open up a payment channel at any hub that you want. In that regard, it is decentralized. If you want to use e-mail. Do you have to sign up for an account at google? No, you can use any provider you want or even setup your own server. 

The problem with lightning network is, you can't set up your own hub because you need a lot of liquidity to process payments which go through other hubs. So you need to be directly connected to a hub that's able to process large transactions over the lightning network reliably. That is a problem. But anyone with a lot of money can set up a mining hub that is well connected."
I think you're correct but it's still clearly censorship. Moderatoration is censorship even if it's sometimes desirable.
"> Whether he really believes that 

From my prior discussions with him about the catholic faith (i.e. how Pope Francis, Benedict XVI, John Paul II were invalid popes), I'd bet he actually believes it if he says it's not censorship, somehow based on the literal definition: 

> the suppression or prohibition of any parts of books, films, news, etc. that are considered obscene, politically unacceptable, or a threat to security

e.g., ""it's not suppressing obscene material or something a government disapproves of"" Or perhaps even more literally:

> mid 16th century ( sense 2 of the noun): from Latin, from censere ‘assess.’

Perhaps the reason he's good at programming is that he takes things very literally. So for example he knows of some centuries-old papal documents that say X, and he takes it literally. Catholic Christians today say ""you have to understand the historical context and what they meant by that,"" but he seems to prefer a staunchly literal meaning and his own beliefs rather than accept what others tell him.

I stopped trying to reason with him when this became clear to me, and it looks like he's disliked for the same autism-spectrum behavior here (what you've called 'a semantics game'), unfortunately. I would say he's sincere also because I think his participation in these Christian discussions have dropped off, suggesting to me he is putting his time into developing Bitcoin."

"**Barycenter**

The barycenter (or barycentre; from the Ancient Greek βαρύς heavy + κέντρον centre) is the center of mass of two or more bodies that are orbiting each other, which is the point around which they both orbit. It is an important concept in fields such as astronomy and astrophysics. The distance from a body's center of mass to the barycenter can be calculated as a simple two-body problem.

In cases where one of the two objects is considerably more massive than the other (and relatively close), the barycenter will typically be located within the more massive object.

"Hey everybody, ProtonMail team here. It's nice to see so much interest in this. To give a little bit more background, we would like to add Bitcoin cash support (plus other cryptocurrencies), but our experience with Bitcoin has shown us that doing this right is actually quite complicated, and will require developers that we can't really spare right now since the team is already stretched quite thin working on existing features.

Here's what we learned from Bitcoin (BTC) support.

First, for privacy reasons, we prefer not to outsource to a third party payment processor. Not only is it a potential privacy risk, crypto payment processors have proven to be less than reliable. Some have killed crypto support arbitrarily (Stripe with BTC for example), are susceptible to govt influence (and could be asked to stop accepting for ProtonMail), and others are just run by technical teams with dubious ability (poor APIs, low reliability, buggy/glitchy, bad performance, etc) which could lead to a shitty user experience for our users.

So for our Bitcoin support, we basically did it ""natively"" without using a payment processor, and instead using blockchain.info. However, this ran into problems in that blockchain.info API was simply not good, and not reliable, not stable, and our crypto volume quickly got so high that blockchain.info started to rate limit us. Of course, getting support from them was basically impossible (why is it that most crypto companies suck so much at support)?

To make a long story short, we believe the correct way to do this is to run multiple nodes ourselves, set them up in a reliable/high availability fashion, and build our own API to interface with the blockchain, so we aren't reliant on poorly designed, badly built, and unreliable/overloaded APIs run by third parties.

This of course involves significantly more work, which is why community help would make this process go faster. If anybody is interested in helping out, send us an email at contact@protonmail.ch with some info about your background and why you might be good at this.

Cheers!
The Proton Team"
