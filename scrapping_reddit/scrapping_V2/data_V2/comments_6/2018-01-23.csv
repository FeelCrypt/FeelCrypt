How do I withdraw bch into a wallet, and how do I safely create and store a wallet? I don't know best practises or anything and have a macbook pro lol
What fraud protection does Bitcoin offer?  It's peer to peer digital cash.  There is not fraud protection.  This is not like a credit card where you can file a complaint and have a charge reversed.
Guilty until proven innocent? 
Do I have to worry about them checking my HDDs in my luggage when I arrive there, or in packages if I ship them?
Interesting. 
In theory? North Korea is widely reported to be behind some large recent hacks, they now have a *lot* of coin. If we succeed in out-playing the Chaincode/Blockstream attack then that's really another card they'll pull next is to start talking shit about how we're empowering North Korea. 
But if they're going for that why not use monero
Right, and do you connect hungry people with food if you have more fascism or less fascism?
Nonsense, they can sustain themselves on principle!
"People need systems of liberty that produce food brother.

Money is half of every transaction, the reason why the poor are poor in today's world are the expiraments their governments have made with socialism. "
Agree. Detalis as always are the most important part. It's hard to grow food at scale, that's why we specialize it so much. Only freedom of association will make them find the best prices of food
Core would still have replace by fee, which ruins it's use as a currency for in store purchases.
BCH is Bitcoin with larger blocks. That's literally what it is. What you're asking has already happened. Bitcoin forked and left behind the older, slower protocol for a faster cheaper one. And yes, it will become irrelevant. 
"They will though. They must, eventually. Even they know and have admitted that. They're just butthurt about not being in control of it. They declined to attend NYA, where they could have at least argued their point. Instead they denounce any decision or agreement because it didn't have ""consensus"".

I do kind of worry about what will happen then, though."
yeah, I agree that's why I've used it in the past, but the miners are really jumping ship it seems. Overall volume has just been so low.
"I'm not here saying it's easier to double spend in ticker BTCs Segwit chain (not currently at least, although the argument could be made that it will be at some point if both systems survived) but rather that due to not following the preplanned scaling solution the way it was intended, the system has become unstable to the point of remaking the design and being reliant on 3rd party apps to provide instant and cheap transfer. 

By considering some nonmining clients full nodes, it was encouraged ignoring the rest of the white paper so as to make the system wildly inefficient by complicating it's design and making it much harder to achieve even the end goals the white paper had set out to achieve."
"Segshit is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.

For example, anyone-can-spend transactions."
Try saying that to a Chinese official who has had it beaten into him that only criminals carry cash, and normal people use bank transfers or credit cards for big purchases.
It's always guilty until proven innocent. Terrorism and money laundering...two of the government's most favorite excuses to pat your down and detain you. If one doesn't stick, the other certainly will.
Is declaring it a problem? 
"Is ""It's my money, and I do what I want with it."" a good reason, or am I guilty until proven innocent? "
OK, so what you are saying it is used to be very expensive/hard to pull off a double-spend on 0 confirmations, but it is a lot easier now on BTC?
"> This was probably not what you meant to imply, but fiat doesn't have any built in dispute resolution as such. Same as with most cryptocurrencies so far, it uses second layers for that.

You are correct.  This isn't a product of fiat.  It's a product of banking and government regulation.  They've added layers on top of fiat to help with fraud by delaying ACH transfers and insuring credit cards."
someone doesn't deserve it yet...
When someone says fraud protection that's what I would expect. If there's no fine print deterring people of that belief then expect lawsuits to come in, because that's the paradigm most people operate in.
Those have existed for a long time, they are called multi-signature transactions
"
>That does not and will never exist in Bitcoin.  

Coming soon with Tabs™
 "
">Most people don't think of fraud protection in that way.

That's why I wrote ""sort of"".  I was just pointing out that it prevents a certain amount of fraud, for the seller and for the currency holders. Even if it's not the sort of thing you were referencing.

> I always thought third party services would arise that you escrow your funds with, and when both parties are satisfied, the funds would then be released,

Speaking of off chain solutions, this does exist and works rather well. Even if fees have obviously risen in some cases as a byproduct of congestion in the Segwit chain.

>This is sort of what Lightning is turning into

I notice you say sort of.

Lightning is not simply any escrow service, but built as a second life line to make the SegWit chain viable again as a payment (no longer cash) network by relying on a network of hubs/small banking or exchange institutions. Opening a payment hub is not free and the participants have to keep money in the hub. (the security could be debated, but it's different than with competing miners)

>doesn't have a dispute resolution mechanism that is as good as fiat.

This was probably not what you meant to imply, but fiat doesn't have any built in dispute resolution as such. Same as with most cryptocurrencies so far, it uses second layers for that.

>But you can't have proper dispute resolution and instant transactions at the same time.

True, in the sense that you can't make it a requirement. 

But do you think it would be possible to still have voluntary schemes set up on the chain? He might have changed his mind at some point (promting him to work on ""other projects"") but it seemed Satoshi [had some ideas](https://web.archive.org/web/20171207033156/https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=195.msg1611) about doing this already lined up. 

Edit: He also mentioned sidechains [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20141018100416/https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1790.msg28715#msg28715/), which seems like a better optIon."
I mean the Bitcoin design itself limits fraud in many ways, because you don't need other financial institutions. In the whitepaper you can also see how Satoshi made it impossible to counterfeit and very hard to double spend.
Well dollars are peer to peer too. 
no limit but you need to declare it. good luck crossing borders with a pile of cash without a damn good reason
"In countries with civil asset forfeiture, governments can seize your funds and require you to prove your innocence before you can regain possession.  These include so-called ""free"" countries such as the US.
"
Depends on the country, but most places I know are $10,000. At least, that’s the amount you can carry undeclared.
North Korea is essentially blacklisted by most nations. Bitcoin can in theory be sent to North Korea.
Poor people need food brother
What would happen if btc decided to just go to bigger blocks wouldnt bch become irrelevant. I know they wont just wondering
Ohhh, you did it now A A Ron.
"Mee too ;)"
"Per the white paper and all of Satoshis explanations elsewhere of how the design is supposed to be implemented, it is. But we still have no controll over the old resource sites and forums. Not even BitcoinTalk or the Bitcoin.it wiki can be trusted anymore.

The arguments for our side that you see there or on r/Bitcoin are not real."
On average it is great.
wut, there's a fast/cheap version already out 
€10,000 in EU, if you're traveling outside the EU. If more than that, you have to declare it. They can seize it if suspect it can come from criminal activity, although you can get it back later if you're able to prove them otherwise.
transactions on bch recently have been sooo slow. way slower than ltc for some reason.
[deleted]
If they think you’re a good person, then no problem provided you pay the import tax and have a nice explanation of why you’re wandering around with that much cash. If they suspect you of money laundering or smuggling or who knows what well then too bad.
You can't fucking move Bitcoin physically. That is not how this works.
Except nobody has to know that I am carrying Bitcoin with me :P
Well, at least practically, that doesn't make any sense. 
But you don't *move* Bitcoin, do you?
And then if it were gold or something, I presume it would fall under customs / trade laws? 
Very eloquent and concise explanation, thank you! gild u/tippr
Yeah, but my question is, do they look for it on HDDs coming from outside Europe?
You can always lie about cash too.  Bitcoin just makes it easier to break the law in a particular way.
"There was a case of TSA agents hassling a guy over a Bitcoin sticker and wanted him to ""show"" them the Bitcoin.    
Edit link: https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2014/03/03/why-the-tsa-hassled-a-traveler-with-bitcoin-in-his-bag/"
It mostly depends on who you are at that point. All goods brought into a country do have to undergo an inspection, but they can also be considered private property, which removes taxes/levys that a government can place on them, at least in the US. I'm not sure how that works in historically socialist countries with additional layer of bureaucracy tacked on top to confuse the hell out of everybody and serve to limit as much sovereign capacity as possible.
"I hardly doubt it, seems paranoia on a completely different level. I've travelled to Dubai and Maldives (with an external HDD, USB) and back to the UK and had no issues by anyone.

Granted the HDD was for storing photos, not for Blockchain related stuff."
If i commit the private key to memory, that means I'm always carrying my bitcoin with me, wherever I go. Does this mean I should always declare it whenever I enter any country? This law is absurd when applied to digital goods 
No because when going through a border they can search your suitcase, bags etc and if necessary you can be subjected to an in-person search. Very risky to try bring anything illegal back.
"In UK you can go to jail for not giving them passwords...


But anyway; the UK is just sorta in the EU, there are a lot of stuff different (and they're leaving the EU, aren't they?). Do you know what it's like on mainland EU?"
Then you wouldn't be carrying them now would you?  I've read about [issues with casascius coins.](https://www.wired.com/2013/12/casascius/)  They are viewed as money in the eyes of the government.  I can't find an article on it at the moment but I have read about people having some minor issues with them at airports too but nothing big I suppose.  I imagine we will see it regulated more tightly in the future.
"What is an ""in-person search""? Also, how would they find bitcoins? I mean, unless you help them in unlocking whatever digital device you have with you. "
"No idea really, I don't really think unless you're on some sort of targeted list that they care. It's too much trouble for them to actual go over a hard disk.

In any case, if I ever had to 'bring' a wallet to a different country, I'd just either memorize it or store it encrypted in cloud with a known passphrase by myself. I'd never in a million years store it on a hard drive for travel purposes."
Maybe, but why store them on a hard drive anyhow? You could write it on a paper.
"All Fiat currencies are 'private credit' meaning they do not belong to the bearer of the notes, but to the entity that printed them. You are essentially leasing the usage of the notes, but not actually owning the notes. Follow me so far?

Because of the above, when you do something with someone else property, and they don't like that, they can place arbitrary rules and consequences on you as long as they were predisposed from doing so.

You get the privilege of 'using' their debt instruments, and they get the privilege of telling you what you can and can't do with them.

Sound fair? Because it isn't, but only because the governments have forced a militant monopoly on the usage of the notes and avoid disclosing what they actually are which is fraud. But, really thats the only gotcha here. If they were more up front about what they are and did not force the usage of their bad debt notes, then everything that is happening would be 100% legal. So its muddy waters to say the least, but the legality of controlling notes is in fact based entirely on law and is legal."
You need to do it for moving bitcoin too.
"I think at the very least you'll have to pay for the ""income"" of having more money than they thought you had before (if that money wasn't already declared). But I suspect crossing borders with large amounts of money is also a taxable event.

And I don't think they'll bother to check your bank activity before treating you as a criminal for having a suspicious amount of money in a hard to track manner; you'll probably have to go thru the effort of proving it came from a bank and then they'll double check everything and try to trace where the money was before it went into that account."
If you declare it, I think then they can use that to decide how much you own them in taxes, and also, they might try to investigate where you got the money from and if they can't trace it to something they consider legit they might start investigating you for money laundering or something of the sort.
Precisely
"No, why? Cryptocurrency balances aren't stored in hard drives, rather they're on the Blockchain. 

Your interface (or access) to it can be anywhere - your mobile, your pendrive, your memory, whatever-have-you."
Who are starving the most in 2018? Venezuelian and North Korean. I wonder why
That lack of /s was risky but it paid out.
Correct. Ther'e more than enough food for everyone, it just misallocated due to barriered markets
To be fair, replace by fee is optional and can be disabled. The store can then verify that rbf is disabled and accept the TX without confirmations.
"> but the miners are really jumping ship it seems.

Doesn't look like the [hashrate](https://fork.lol/pow/hashrate) has changed much in recent times, and it doesn't look like the [block speed](https://fork.lol/pow/speed) is too far from the average either.

"
I think they would be more interested in how you got it than what you're gonna do with it (as long as part of what you're gonna do with it involves paying income taxes and taxes for bringing money into the country or something like that).
What about Europe? 
"Would I be required to verify a bank withdrawal or something like that, or what? 

Do I have to pay taxes just for physically moving cash? *Yikes!* "
Wait, I have to pay tax just for physically moving my own cash? *Yikes!* 
There's no tax, I don't know where you got that idea. Crossing the CAD/US border all you have to do is declare that you're transporting cash. They might look into the situation to make sure you're not doing anything illicit but that's it. If you fail to declare and they find it, they can seize it with the assumption that you're planning something illegal or have a reason to hide it but even then, with a good explanation(at least on the Canada side) they'll let you keep it. 
Basis in law? 
">Cryptocurrency balances aren't stored in hard drives

But do they know that? And do they care?"
With full blocks, the status of the RBF flag does not matter. Low fee transactions get dropped off the crammed mempool: and can be replaced.
Depends on the country, some are free. But places like UK you’d still be taken into a room for questioning if you declare the cash.
Taxes mostly operate on trust anyways.  We self report in the USA.  Auditing is not done proactively, but retroactively.
If the question is so easily deflected, why bother asking? 
I thought bch is bitcoin ??
I've read that you can carry more in the form of stuff like american silver eagles and american gold eagles since those are marked as legal tender and way undervalued.  A gold eagle marked $50 is worth about $1500.  People with even more money just move stuff like art around or do things that don't require you to physically move an asset.
Actuality it sort of is... But it never used to come at the expense of system efficiency. The original design works differently.
When someone falsely claims they transferred money, you can prove they're lying. That's some fraud protection. 
It's not really that fast if you do pay a high fee.
"They are trying to use fraud protection as a way to justify the high fees. The logic is something like: High Fees -> more incentive to mine -> more miners -> better fraud protection.

Technically that is all true, but it is only relevant for a specific type of fraud and I don't know if it is worth so much higher fees. "
Frog protection?
Why not just put decentralized. Lol. 
Gold is worldwide, cash dollars also. But try to fly with a suitcase full of them - you can't. Bitcoin can be carried in your memory alone if needed. Borderless is whats novel.
and because they're not brave enough anymore to suggest they're going to dare to allow transactions to blacklisted countries
I mean, in the most basic way it kind of does, since the ledger is public, but it doesn’t really do anything to prevent fraud

That's the responsible and honest thing to do. Can't think of any examples of projects changing their materials to reflect a less favourable reality. 
They should not try to steal the Bitcoin name like that, it should be able to stand on it's own merit. Maybe call it BLegacy. (/s, kind of.. partly a joke, but.. somewhat also true, I don't know..)
">Bitcoin Legacy.

This will never happen at this point. For the last 5 months, people have continued to use the Bitcoin Blockchain.

They didn't made it reflect a less favorable reality, they swept the less favorable reality under the rug.
"The video really talks about fast and cheap transfer. It is really the best part of Bitcoin after the fact it's permissionless. 

Those idiots think they could force everyone to pay high fee... it's open source... Bitcoin will be BCH!"
Fraud commited by a payer against a payee? CC charge reversal and the like? Or PayPal reversals. There's all kinds of scams and fraud that people carry out with payment methods where payment can be cancelled or reversed. It's pretty common.
Yeah like wtf, fraud protection is one thing it DOESN'T have! Got scammed? Tough luck.
Lmao
Fraud protection is absolutely false statement. Bitcoin is neutral to everything including fraud, and exists above jurisdictions 
The question is: will it work out right?
WOW.
"Sorry ,could you tell me

But it does seems that the claims in both subs are exaggerated."
Its about time, they were misleading a bunch of people.  Why don't they switch the site over to Bitcoin Cash the real Bitcoin?  What do you think /u/cobra-bitcoin ? I think it is time.
"Ironically also, borderless and fraudprotection are good to add. It's just in this situation it looks really bad because they remove other other important points.

In other words, their version of ""Bitcoin"" is no longer for cheap or worldwide use. Can we even call it a crypto currency?"
"They forgot to change the first sentence, directly above the video.

""Bitcoin WAS an innovative payment network which has been crippled by an incompetent Dev Team"""
Congratulations! You just did your good deed of the day, now don't be so tough on yourself, lay down, drink your hot milk and rest little buddy. It is so hard to be a Bitcoin hater this days right? Well, you're doing a great job missing on your life while focusing on bullshit like the Bitcoin website changed 2 details in their front page.. but hey! They never though they had to face such a great artist of uncovering the obvious and the unnecessary. Kudos!
"Fraud protection?! Seriously? How is Bitcoin protecting people from fraud?

If I get fraud, my bank will reimburse me. If I get fraud in Bitcoin, there is no one who can do anything to get my money back."
xd
haha thats rich coming from a bcashill :D
So sorry for you guys, I really am. 
Is this the end of bitcoin?
Why don't they simply sell small blocks and their definition of decentralization? That's what they chant in r/bitcoin
Would you guys still hate on BTC if it’s transactions became cheap and fast again? Or is there something bigger that fuels the dislike for that currency?
finally... And to celebrate the end of the January crash I bought that ! https://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-Crash-January-2018-T-Shirt/dp/B0794F7D6S/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1516736427&sr=8-1&keywords=bitcoin+crash+2018
Use BCH
Bitcoin transaction is no longer “fast” if you’re not paying high transaction fee. Therefore they can’t claim its fast and charges low in fees
"False. Yes, it's neither polished nor easy, but participation in fiat economy constricts the level of worldwide economic freedom, and participation in open blochchain economy expands it

Wtf
After years of nonsense a lot of us moved along and accept BitcoinCash as BTC.  I'm not looking back.  Even if legacy Bitcoin is fixed.
"At this point there's a lot of distrust for the development process and virtually all of pro Segwit chain sites have faulty technical information and often manipulative language. They quote Satoshi out of context, then suggest our side of the argument is wrong and that we do it. They also still ban users for even mentioning Bitcoin Cash support.

On the technical side, the errors stem from misleading the public that Satoshi ever considered nonminers full nodes. He didn't and there's plenty of examples saying the opposite. Without that problem, they never could have justified burrying the preplanned scaling plan consistent with the whitepaper by keeping the 1MB limit that Satoshi wanted to raise way past expiration date. This in turn allowed them to argue for going against the definition of a coin by implementing SegWit. Now the chain depends on the development of a 3d party second layer with 3d party payment channels. It could work fantastically well, but none of that is Bitcoin.

I don't really hate on anyone though. Plain text just makes people on the internet all look the same unless we already know them. Most people here are not constantly angry or anything and many of the trolls simply pour in from other subs."
I think the trust has already been broken. whats to say there isnt another major issue down the track, we're back to square one again. at least with bitcoin cash we have a better way forward, yes it may take longer to achieve, but we'll all be better off for it.
"Partly depends on how they would become cheap and fast again- if it’s simply by lack of use (transactions per day dropped dramatically) then no, because that didn’t fix the problem. 

And at this point I won’t trust bitcoin until Core devs are out. They have clearly haven’t acted in the best interest of bitcoin now, and even if they started, I don’t trust that they wouldn’t revert at some point "
I just care about what works, I guess. *shrug* 
">Would you guys still hate on BTC if it’s transactions became cheap and fast again?

Don't forget reliable and highly censorship resistant.

|

But after all the damage the people ru(i)nning it have caused, I'm not sure if fixing that stuff would be enough; I don't think we can ever trust those devs again. And there is still the issue of the way they manage their sites, forums, wikis, subs etc."
"*if*. Actually we love expensive and slow and are doing everything we can to assist 1 meg Greg's fee market and Luke-jr's smaller blocks. /s

Eventually the mempool will clear and BTC's fees will be cheap and fast, but this will only happen if BTC becomes less popular. Both segwit and LN might help a bit, but both need to fight for adoption. Guess what, we sold all our BTC so we are here to fight it... Well maybe not LN because of it succeeds then BCH is one simple small hard fork away from adopting it."
"False, more and more the poor in the 3rd world have access to mobile phones. Smart mobile phones, capable of email and thus Bitcoin Cash ;)"
"Brave enough to change the material and be honest about the fact that low fees are no longer a reality.

Didn't get the blacklisted countries part."
New video required.
What's the limit on how much cash I can carry? 
"Except for building Bitcoin Cash, this is actually not such a bad question. 

We should consider doing something to the opposite of what they did on the old site! Someone might want to make a video explaining why this is controversial at all. And some of our sites might want to adopt video as a means of communicating the message of _worldwide micropayments even without 2nd layers_ in particular."

Something something magic internet frogs.

Yes but what IS fraud protection?

"Most people don't think of fraud protection in that way.  To them, fraud protection is that they pay someone, never receive their goods, and are able to file a complaint and get their money back.

That does not and will never exist in Bitcoin.  Cash doesn't work that way.  It's instantaneous.  I always thought third party services would arise that you escrow your funds with, and when both parties are satisfied, the funds would then be released,  This is sort of what Lightning is turning into, but it's kludgy and complicated and doesn't have a dispute resolution mechanism that is as good as fiat.

But you can't have proper dispute resolution and instant transactions at the same time."
Someone doesn’t want a useable cryptocurrency...
For who and why?
Malware can't wipe out your bank account as easily as it could eat up all of your bitcoins if you were to be hacked.
Except when the lighting network and segwit are implemented in all transactions and its cheap and fast again

This argument was also used by David Vorick from Sia in a well written [blog post](https://blog.sia.tech/choosing-asics-for-sia-b318505b5b51).  It makes sense and changed my perspective on ASICs.
"Reading this makes me think Luke and Cobra and Theymos are all the same person.

Lightning will eventually need larger blocks anyway. Very few people think the block size should be kept at the current size forever, but people just differ on when and how it should be increased. It can be done through a soft fork when needed (though unlike Segwit, it probably should be enforced and not opt-in).

Uhh, Coinbase? Bitfinex? Bitstamp? Kraken? GDAX? Poloniex?

Which side supposedly spreads misinformation again?"
Consider if your expenses are in fiat. Then accepting bitcoin is also taking on the difficulty and risk of converting a bunch of currency.
Because businesses have better things to do than program an invoicing, notification, and verification system with smooth UI/UX that calculates prices in fiat equivalent and provides support when things go wrong. 
"> there arent BCH exchanges

Coinbase/GDAX, Bitstamp, etc..."
Coinex? Stop spreading fake propaganda please.
you fucking wish, way too many people will hold BCH no matter how low it drops, including me.
Circle stopped using Bitcoin a long time ago and replaced it with a money transfer system that uses Ethereum.
"The nice thing about Stripe was that it processed bitcoin AND credit cards in only one payment processor.

Does Bitpay do credit cards?"
honey badger dont care? 
Guys this is good for Bitcoin!
There was a meme to hodl, there was a meme to get merchants to adopt so the price goes up, but there was never (until recently with BCH) any meme to actually spedn, it was all fake. :/
Why didn't this company just add segwit and wait for lightning?  All they had to do was hodl!  
I emailed them to support BCH a while ago..  hope they do it.
We got some ass kissing too. Very carefully worded.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iHZi-z7H4o
"that meme didn't actually work

merchants accepting lots of crypto payments does not in fact make them think ""people must think these crypto are worthless if they're giving them away to me as payments!"" that is a weird thought no"
"It sucks.

I loved using Bitcoin to buy hardware on TigerDirect or support smaller crypto startups that only allowed Bitcoin payments. I actually used Bitcoin a ton back around 2014-2015 when it was growing in adoption like crazy. I haven't used it for anything but trading in years. I miss those earlier days."
Stellar price seems relatively unaffected rn
>It’s possible that Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, or another Bitcoin variant, will find a way to achieve significant popularity while keeping settlement times and transaction fees very low.
They need to add BCH ASAP.
"TELL THEM. This is the time for Stripes' customers to let them know that the community and enthusiasm is still here, and that the Bitcoin lives on in Bitcoin Cash.

The dev work required to move from BTC to BCH is minimal, and instead of just being a sad day for crypto, this could be the start of a beautiful year for BCH.

But we have to make noise and get them to listen. Together we have the power to change history.

"> If you guys want bch to survive, you have to market yourselves and not take on the one crypto that rules them all.

BTC as the leader of the cryptos, like every good leader, should have shown decisions taken *for* its supporters, and not in its own interest.

But as an exact opposite, blocks didn't increase, arrived a segwit no one wanted and still understand/use, fees increased, delays increased, futures are played by goldenboys, and shops (like Steam and Stripe - it's not nothing for god's sake - ceased to use BTC) and now LN to be driven by companies and banks.

Shame on you, BTC."
They might be aware but what drives them to action is you the user emailing them for BCH support. Remember we have to outwork BTC by a large margin to succeed. We can't fall back on the merit of BCH being the original BTC. We the users play the most critical role in the success of BCH. More than miners or developers. So please email!
Indeed. Bitcoin should not depend on any fiat payment or currency exchange for liquidity. Bitcoin is a payment system and currency.
/s
ETC isn’t aimed for payments.
Agreed. They must of invested heavily when rolling out BTC support. I reckon they have lost out from doing so.
"if it worked with bitcoin pre august 1, it works with bitcoin cash. no system upgrade necessary.

by what metric is the BCH network not ""big enough""?

it is not that BCH must accelerate its growth for companies to adopt it. who does that and how? rather, BCH's growth is accelerated by companies adopting it. "
Since they stop accepting BTC, it should be a relatively simple process: just modify their existing BTC systems into BCH systems.
BTC payments were never a big winner, and BCH payments are even smaller (for now) - I've used stripe for all my store's payment processing for a couple of years now and in that time I've had zero people pay with BTC.
"If you read the whole post, they say towards the end that they will continue to monitor the crypto space, and mentioned eth, LTC, stellar, and even that they would reconsider bitcoin in the future. Overall a very well written post.

It is chicken and egg all over again. Some of us spent thousands of coins to initialize the Bitcoin economy and overcome such thresholds. And it all amounted to a bazillion noobs educating us in the merits of HODL. \*sigh\*

"No, this is a failed fork. 4 months later, there arent BCH exchanges, Circle never gave their uses BCH, the blockchain moved forward with Bitcoin.

Ethereum had a fork, and within a week, everyone knew that the fork was a success. 

BCH is useful for transactions, but so are 1000 other cryptos."
Yeah that's the fact of the matter is that the BTC merchant boom was *fake*. People liked to get merchants to say they were adopting BTC, because it made the price go up on the good news, and that's it. Nobody had a habit of going to those merchants and buying things, there were no booming SPEDN threads, there was no such meme. BCH's merchant adoption boom will be the first *real* adoption.
No need, they are very aware of BCH, they wrote about it... RTFA!

"It will take some investment to update their systems, but it looks like BCH's network isn't big enough for them to justify it at this time. This may seem short sighted, but they are waiting for a clear winner in the coin wars before they sink time and money into it.

"LOL why would it be spam. Please tell me how as a business do you expect to know what your consumers want? Businesses only add something if there is significant demand. Show them demand! Every time a payment processor drops bitcoin we should be looking at it as an opportunity. We should be eating their lunch at every opportunity we get. But they will not know unless we tell them we want it. The article even states that it's only a ""possibility."" So either we get to work or someone else eats our opportunity."
"> Bitcoin has evolved to become better-suited to being an asset than being a means of exchange.

Due to that, I think Bitcoin has failed and I no longer see it surviving long-term, simply due to the fact that there is much better tech out there now in the form of other coins. (Not going to shill any specific coin here.) What do I mean by ""failed""? I got the impression from what I've read from Satoshi that they wanted Bitcoin to be a type of electronic cash and not necessarily only a store of value (see e.g. [this email by Satoshi](http://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/emails/cryptography/17/)). Yes, decentralized and trust-less, but still useable for even micro-transactions (from the linked article):

> It could get started in a narrow niche like reward points, donation tokens, currency for a game or micropayments for adult sites. Initially it can be used in proof-of-work applications for services that could almost be free but not quite.

Bitcoin seems very much inspired by [Bit gold](http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2005/12/bit-gold.html), which summarizes with:

> In summary, all money mankind has ever used has been insecure in one way or another. This insecurity has been manifested in a wide variety of ways, from counterfeiting to theft, but the most pernicious of which has probably been inflation. Bit gold may provide us with a money of unprecedented security from these dangers.

A currency (read: gold) only has value because we, as a society, decide that it does. Gold is a ""good"" store of value because we have currency depreciation with fiat, so storing your long-term value it in doesn't make sense. What happens when (not if) we stop storing our value in physical things like gold and we create a global digital currency that's fast, secure, trust-less, decentralized, and most of all a stable store of value? (Open to hear discussion on if that is even possible.)

A cryptocurrency with those characteristics has all the benefits of gold, without the need for carrying all that expensive-to-move, heavy metal around with you to be able to exchange any of it for goods. And you could exchange on a global scale, something not possible with gold. Banks would be on their way out, because the people would be in control of their own money.

What happens to government-backed fiat when people can exchange their gold like they would fiat? I'd think fiat would start to lose favor. But I'm not sure what affect that would have on world governments and society. (Again, open to discussion because I'm not super well-versed in these subjects.)

Currently, Bitcoin can't do that in its current form—that is, be easily exchangeable for goods—its simply turned into a digitized gold that has the same issues when it comes to exchange—but I think we'll eventually get there with a coin, and there's some promising altcoins that have awesome tech right now. Maybe that coin ends up being Bitcoin after all. Maybe there will be coins, plural, who knows.

Maybe all that is a bit too utopian and it simply can't work on a global scale with governments, etc."
So basically fuck you BTC.
My company was using their integration since it was in beta, even before the fees, transaction times, and forking dramas. We never received a single payment in BTC.
"OmiseGO is an ambitious and clever proposal; more broadly, Ethereum continues to spawn many high-potential projects. Let's wait and see. "
"Sad, but inevitable. 

""It’s possible that Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, or another Bitcoin variant, will find a way to achieve significant popularity while keeping settlement times and transaction fees very low.""

What I don't understand is why they cannot add Bitcoin Cash now. It is the same API and it wouldn't really require that much to do, since it is essentially Bitcoin but with larger block capacity."
"Good points.

But you also have to be careful not to overdo it. "
I was shocked at first but now that I think about it payment solutions that use BCH might make Stripe irrelevant.
"> merchants accepting lots of crypto payments does not in fact make them think ""people must think these crypto are worthless if they're giving them away to me as payments!""

The article doesn't argue that merchants should not accept crypto payments.

Instead it implies that the more demand there is for crypto, the more likely it is that merchants will start accepting them.

I would point out that the more demand there is for crypto, the more people are incentivized to try to earn crypto by running crypto payment processor services."
No one cares about these silly US dollars, people keep giving them away :p
"In the rbtards sub they're already accusing Roger of bribing Stripe to stop accepting BTC. Another poster was calling for a Bitcoin blocksize increase (haha, good luck with that btards). They're also hyping their LN-goldberg machine to solve everything, soon'ish (2 weeks^tm). Another commenter also claimed that if anything got to bitcoins scale, they would have the same problem. Nevermind that Ethereum now processes between 400%-500% of bitcoins transactions.

Stupidity it seems, knows no bounds."
> It’s possible that **Bitcoin Cash**, Litecoin, or another Bitcoin variant, will find a way to achieve significant popularity while keeping settlement times and transaction fees very low. Bitcoin itself may become viable for payments again in the future.

[We had a thread already](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7hnavw/bitcoin_cash_merchant_adoption_blitzkrieg_day_2_5/) so keep asking them to support Bitcoin Cash on Twitter etc.
I've never understood why I would want a payment processor for accepting bitcoin.  I'd rather just accept bitcoin directly.  We don't need middle men.
"Well I can clear up a bit of confusion and say that BU was not part of any ""more or less"" agreement.  But also, when I was asked to contribute  (about a week before the ABC merge), the other algorithms seemed ""fully baked""... in fact there was more work coming from them that I was able to use in my analysis (a complete simulation framework) than from the DAA algorithm that was merged.

The ABC merge did seem to be ill-timed to me since it occurred just after the other devs had quantitively shown that the algorithm was inferior in some respects.  I'm still surprised we don't see variable hash rate since I was able to show how certain techniques can be used to extract about 5% more revenue than mining on one chain alone.  I haven't done the analysis of current network conditions but I've heard several times that the BTC network is more than 5% profitable to mine than BCH now due to fees.  My techniques assume that the 2 networks are more or less equally profitable..."
My issue is with you calling it fair to sabotage the competition.
"I had to personally run around and convince the other devs that the ABC DAA was not so bad and that this wasn't setting a terrible precedent.  If I hadn't done that we might have had 2 Bitcoin Cashes or 1 full node client.  What Amaury did was not ""leadership"", it could have created a Bitcoin Core-like sh*tfest at a very delicate time, sending the BCH price into the dumpster.  Leadership would be to analyze the data and merge the best algorithm, not your own.  I think that he has learned from this experience and hope to see more actual leadership from him in the future but honestly it galls me to hear you extolling this episode because it dismisses all the work that was done by others and the fact that it almost irrevocably fractured the development community.  When I came into the picture there were 3 fully fledged proposals, the only issue was to pick one.  As I previously stated, its an hours job to make a DAA, its a lot more time to prove that it works well since the problem is basically intractable.  Those other devs created the entire infrastructure to test DAAs and wrote competing implementations (I basically verified their work, added a few tweaks, made pretty graphs and wrote a clear document).

WRT to leadership, Bitcoin Unlimited (Peter Rizun) took the bull by the horns, proposed the UAHF split on Aug 1, and we energized the community.  We did not have the first Bitcoin Cash client because I delegated responsibility to an engineer who subsequently did nothing on the BU Cash client, worked on ABC and neglected to tell me his choice.  I screwed up by not watching him closely, but the BU ""Satoshi's Vision"" conf was just around the corner.  However, I've always wanted there to be a competing large block client so its great that ABC exists.  But this was an awkward truth to its birth, and the resulting majority hash power is unfortunate.  Hopefully, the pendulum will swing back to a more egalitarian hash distribution soon. "
"> Weird, I have you tagged as one of the people that had a DA proposal...

I probably wrote the most on the topic on places like yours.org, I wrote a visual emulator to see the effects.

But I never actually wrote a new DAA, so your tag is only half right."
BU is the client that first proposed the fork that became bitcoin cash.  This is an undisputed fact with github commit paper trail....
"> It wouldn't be fair to make them compete against normal low fee near instant transactions.

Except that you said pretty much the opposite:

>It wouldn't be fair to make them compete against normal low fee near instant transactions.

That is what would be fair; it is not fair for it to compete with crippled on-chain transactions."
"all points well made and duly noted

fair enough and thanks again for all your contributions"
"> he was the only one that was in actual fact blocking all the other existing DAA implementations (by not pressing 'merge')

I can't find a polite way to reply to this.  I'm sure this means I'm misunderstanding you.  Maybe you want to rephrase this to help me understand how Amaury blocked you from merging a DAA fix *in the repo you control.*

> It may be interesting to re-view the entire episode knowing that there were various DAA-implementations and they had been working together to ship the best one in ABC

What about XT, Classic, and BU?

I think we have some sort of paradigm problem.  A you say ""potato"" I say ""missile defense system"" sort of paradigm problem.

:|

Peace."
">  I'm sure this means I'm misunderstanding you.

yes, it looks very much like you are. I get the feeling you are trying to fit my answers in your world view where I try to defend myself.  
Maybe you see my replies as a way to explain why BU and Classic didn't bother with the DAA.

You won't get any such answers because there are none. I'm am not and have never been involved in any DAA work (other than advising and writing an emulator). I don't care and have never cared which one actually is chosen.

This is why you see me repeat again and again that you have a big disconnect between what you think happened and what actually happened. What actually happened is that a series of individuals were working with one bitcoin implementation and one implementation only.

As such your (and Amaurys) retort that those **unaligned individuals** should not be upset, they should just have released theirs is at best misleading because it makes it look like those individuals had their own bitcoin implementation while they did not.

So, sure, they could have said they would go to another implementation (Classic/BU) and ask them to merge their work and release it. You can ask them why they didn't. My bet is that their answer would be that it just would have made the whole thing worse.

> > It may be interesting to re-view the entire episode knowing that there were various DAA-implementations and they had been working together to ship the best one in ABC

> What about XT, Classic, and BU?

What about them? As I wrote various times before, they were not involved in the DAA process at all. The whole process was done on private channels.

I hope you understand a bit better, if you don't, feel free to send me a private message or even open dialogue on keybase/appear.in etc."
"> BU was not part of any ""more or less"" agreement.

Right, that's what I saw as well. This is why I think it's unfair that Thomas takes the position that the DAA was basically a solved problem among the other implementations, but Amaury blocked the solution.

If you guys all mostly agreed on a DAA fix as Thomas claims, then the fault would lie with you for not having merged it and announced it fixed prior to Amaury even getting involved with a different algo.

But that just wasn't the case.  There wasn't ""more or less consensus"" among the various Cash teams.  There was a lot of debating and bikeshedding (in my opinion based on what I saw) and not decisive action (which is what Amaury took)."
Awesome. Then congrats for being part of the team that got it right in the end.
That's the point.  There would be no fork over small disagreement like DAA.  If BU, XT, and Classic had some consensus on a DAA prior to Amaury, they didn't have to wait on him.  They could have just merged their DAA and announced that Bitcoin Cash was fixing its DAA.
Yeah we making same point
"> I know why my code wasn't merged, I didn't write a DAA :-D Nothing to merge...

Weird, I have you tagged as one of the people that had a DA proposal..."
Hm, I see.
"The thing is that the ABC merge happened just after there was consensus that other algorithms were better.  What happened leading up to that (who produced what algorithm first) IDK because BU wasn't involved.  Ultimately, they have majority hash now so they call the shots unless that changes or something is provably super-broken.  By unilaterally merging, ABC activated ""the last argument of kings"" and basically shat on everyone else's work, including a dev who was strongly associated with ABC... but hey, that's how the blockchain works.  Deal with it or found yet another alt."
"Yes, I remember that. I also participated in the work that @rocks and @freetrade did on the ""Satoshi's Bitcoin"" project.  There was a lot of grassroots community support that led to Bitcoin Cash, and we all need to pay respects to one another for each of our contributions."
"> We did not have the first Bitcoin Cash client because I delegated responsibility to an engineer who subsequently did nothing on the BU Cash client, worked on ABC and neglected to tell me his choice.

Thanks for explaining this aspect that I didn't previously understand.

I understand your views on Amaury's cowboyism and I agree with you that it would be best if that were tempered somewhat.  Again I'm sure this sounds condescending but Amaury *is* young and he is talented, which tends towards frustration with others and cowboyism.   I used to be quite guilty of this myself (probably still am to a degree, but I'm an old dude now, so I'm automatically slower :) but as he continues to work in this space hopefully he will mesh better with others.

OTOH if not then I guess it will fall to all of us to combat him, but it would be a lot better if it goes the other way.

Thanks for all of your efforts Andrew."
I'm pretty much saying it wouldn't be able to compete 
">But that's LN's entire raison d'etre.

It is, but that's why it's considered Alpha, it works but it needs improvement to scale to a massive size. 

Keep in mind that scaling to a large amount of nodes is a different problem than scaling to a large amount of transactions. 

LN could already be useful (if the bugs were fixed) for people to send money between exchanges and to crypto friendly merchants like Steam, Dell and Newegg while saving on fees and getting instant transactions.

It probably needs better routing to handle large numbers of nodes but isn't an urgent need, it doesn't have to be ready right now.

>As it is, it is little more than a UI mockup.

It's more than that, it's just unfinished.

>Let's agree to talk again in 18 months.

Sure. I think by that time we'll be debating something else that has become a problem in the meantime. "
"I guess that you missed the larger scope of the thread.\

Thomas is complaining about Amaury's process of implementing the DAA fix in ABC.

Previously, Thomas had made the point that (according to him) there was already widespread consensus among the ""not-ABC"" devs on a different DAA improvement that was never merged into any of the projects; then Amaury instead went rogue cowboy and implemented his own preferred DAA, which everyone then had to implement in their Cash clients.

My point to Thomas was that, since (according to him) BU, Classic, and XT all came to more or less agreement on a DAA fix a month or more prior to Amaury announcing his fix in Cash -- then BU, Classic, and XT should have just merged *their* preferred DAA fix a month before Amaury announced his, then we would just be using that DAA and not still bitching about the way Amaury proceeded.

Initiative must be taken, it is not simply granted."
"> If you essentially communicate, [Classic doesn't care] then in my opinion your degree of dissatisfaction with the manner in which the decision was reached is unjustified. 

That makes no sense... Just because others do the work you can still be an outside observer and observe people abusing power-positions. In fact, I'd say being an outside observer places one in a better position as such as that person is less likely to be biased.

> ABC is allowed to use any decision process they like, 

The problem has always been about the lies and the deceit. The fact that the process they advertised as taking not being the process they actually took. (I touched on these points many times, not going to repeat them here).

I'm just a well informed ""citizen"" that notices a person in power abusing it for his own personal gain. I've repeated the fact that I had no interest in the outcome and I had no horse in the race a lot, and this I did to make clear I personally and Classic the project were not involved.

Anyway, this really is the last message on the topic from me. If you want to continue talking, thats fine. Just maybe not here ;)"
"According to what Thomas said the developers of the different solutions couldn't get their code merged because the maintainers wouldn't do it.

So it was not really a problem of people not acting. It was more like action was being blocked by those who controlled the repo. And Amaury didn't have this problem since he controls ABC repo."
"Hi Thomas,

I think I do understand what you're saying, and I don't think that I have misunderstood you.  Let me see if I get this right.

What you are saying here continues to confirm what I understand.  ABC / Amaury / certain individuals took a leadership role in fixing the DAA.  Yourself / XT / Classic / BU claimed to be agnostic to the decision and were not interested in merging a DAA fix provided by ""unaligned individuals"" and releasing it, in other words, you made an active decision to be a follower in this process. 

Please help me if I'm still misunderstanding to this point.

Here then I would agree with Amaury.  If you essentially communicate, ""this implementation isn't going to lead on DAA, you (ABC) go figure it out and we'll implement what you come up with"" then in my opinion your degree of dissatisfaction with the manner in which the decision was reached is unjustified.  ABC is allowed to use any decision process they like, including Absolute Monarchy, just as Classic is free to choose any decision process it likes.  These processes only govern the respective implementations, and shouldn't be confused with being a decision process that governs Bitcoin Cash, the protocol.

Please help me if I'm still misunderstanding.

Again, since this is low-grade electronic communication not face-to-face I feel the need to reiterate continually my gratitude for your innumerable contributions over the years.  I deeply want to express that all of this conversation is founded in a sense of respect and gratitude for your contributions."
"it is my opinion and that of many others that nullc is not merely a forceful personality with unusual opinions, but actually a community disruptor / destructor / malactor

in this regard I think such a comparison is quite unfair because I have not seen that sort of disruptive and harmful behavior from Amaury.

however there is far bigger point that I want to make as loudly as possible.  I doubt many people will read this missive buried in this thread but I hope to really reach you if I can.

software repos are little kingdoms by virtue of their emergent organizational structure.  every repo has a king.  that might be a BDFL or an asshole, it might be a puppet who simply blesses the decision of a group, but there's ""a guy"" that has his finger on ""the button"" that, ultimately, decides ""what goes in the code and what doesn't.""

No amount of team structures and decision processes change that fact.  A repo is a fundamentally hierarchical structure, regardless of the nonhierarchical overlays that one might wish to put on top of it.

This is maybe the most important thing I can say to the entire Bitcoin community based on my thirty five years of software development experience and my seven years of involvement with this specific project: you can't decentralize development with a decision process overlay.  Development must be decentralized by having multiple competing / collaborating teams.  There is no other way.

So when you write

> The problem is that we can't do anything about it, other than to encourage him to realize that dictatorship like behavior will result in people leaving just like BTC.

This seems to me to imply that Bitcoin ABC is Bitcoin Cash.  But this is not true.  BU is also Bitcoin Cash.  If BU is robust and well-used in the Cash community, then malbehavior by Amaury should simply result in more people running BU, provided that BU is seen as a complete and robust alternative to ABC.

However, in order for BU to be seen as a robust and complete alternative to ABC, we (the community) need to see *equivalent leadership* from BU that we see from ABC.

So I hope that you understand that I am not being an Amaury fanboi and I'm actually both quite depressed and insulted that you see it this way :( :( :(

Let me back up.

I hope that we can agree that, whatever the faults of the process, that the DAA-fix hardfork was an unmitigated success worthy of many bottles of ""champaign.""  Nothing's perfect but the community managed to decisively hardfork to fix a problem in an amazingly short amount of time and without causing a chainsplit.

Even if something went wrong, the bigger picture is that something went **right.**  Very right.  A ""they said it couldn't be done"" sort of ""right.""

I'm trying to shine a bright light on the thing that Amaury did *right*  so that hopefully the next time something like this comes up, it's BU taking the initiative, not ABC.  The whole community will be made better off if, when the next situation arises, it's ""not-ABC"" taking the initiative and leading the community through the hardfork.  **This is what we really need more than anything** and I would shout it from the rooftops if I could.  This is the most important socio-structural development that can possibly happen to our coin and when it does it will be one of those events whose significance is lost on almost everyone until years later.  **it's that important** please hear me.

If this happens, then we (the community) do not have to worry about Amaury going all nullc, because we can simply turn away from his work product, and towards yours.  But we need to see *decisive leadership.*

Now you might not like Amaury's brand of (IMO) immature decisive leadership (he is after all a young guy) but --- it's still decisive leadership. 

It would be good if Amaury could temper his leadership traits with better interpersonal change management skills but that is something that is learned over considerable time (I speak from experience here :).

While we wait and hope for Amaury to mature, however, we can set an example by becoming better leaders ourselves.

I hope you really take all this to heart Andrew.  I am an enormous fan of BU.  You guys (the original ""alternate BTC implementations"") are truly the heart and soul of the Cash community.  I earnestly hope that we see more community leadership from BU (and XT, and hopefully other clients) in the near future, so that ABC can bee correctly seen as 'one of many' and not some sort of reference or leadership implementation.

Peace and best regards."
Strange thing to say.
"> Amaury is on a path to becoming Bitcoin Cash's ""nullc 2.0"" 

This thought was originally voiced (not by tom) about 9 months before the bitcoin cash fork, due to his behavior working on BU.  So I'd say it is a present danger. The problem is that we can't do anything about it, other than to encourage him to realize that dictatorship like behavior will result in people leaving just like BTC.  Fanboi posts do not help this situation.

"This is rewriting history.  Concerns were raised to me about the ABC DAA about a week before Amaury merged it.  Before that I figured it was best left in his hands so hadn't looked at it at all. There's no point in everyone doing everyone else's job.  In particular, I was working on the gigablock research, and our presentation at scaling bitcoin started the price reversal so this was very important work.

The most important criticism was there was no published analysis of the ABC Daa.  Additionally some other algorithms were claimed to be  better.  I spent a week and published a careful analysis and yes the other algs were marginally better.  But all still could cause chain death and other issues.    ABC merged.  We decided to follow the ABC merge because the algorithm is ok.  End of story.

Nobody is sitting around doing nothing.  ABC took the initiative to make the DAA which is why others did not.  The only problem was the algorithm wasn't sufficiently analyzed resulting in a last minute rush.  We did not want an EDA repeat.  It's about an hour to code up a DAA... it's hard to show that it's good."

"I guess it might be possible to get miners to upgrade to a new algo if we make it so at first both the new and the old algo are allowed on the chain, but blocks mined with the new algo get paid more (obviously tweaking the halving algorithm to continue to respect the original maximum total number of coins generated) for as long as there are still a certain number of blocks mined with the old algo in the last N blocks (after that threshold is crossed, the old algo would no longer be accepted for new blocks). Maybe even have the rewards of the old and new blocks gradually change over time; starting with the old algo having the same reward and the new one just a little over and keep reducing the reward of the old and increasing the reward of the new, or perhaps start with double reward for the new, and gradually reduce the rewards of both types until the new goes back to the normal reward and the old reaches zero, perhaps based on the percentage of blocks mined with each algo in the last N blocks (not forgetting to adjust the halving algo accordingly in either case).

That's my point, for LN to compete fairly with on-chain transactions, on-chain transactions would have to not have been sabotaged. By having on-chain transactions sabotaged, LN is being given unfair advantages.
"Classic, BU, and XT all originated from a culture of ""creating a change then waiting for it to be accepted by the majority."" This was the Stockholm syndrome situation we had under Core. That approach failed time and time again. 

No, it did not. The BU plan was working better than the Core plan, XT or classic's plan. what failed was miners supporting a centralized authority who promised to give them 2X, a lie, something the DCG and Mastercard investment group could not give them.

BU was working and if miners had not been tricked into supporting segwit BU would have finished victorious without a chain split.

"BU had 45-50% of the hashrate while Segwit had 26-33% 

FYI that's 50% of the network signalling for BU roadmap and 33% signalling for Core roadmap and 27% being agnostic. 

well plaid DCG who didn't invite BU to the negotiation table. 

BU was growing and the will to keep the transactions limited, depreciating. It was just a matter of time before Core gave up on their minority coup.

I guess the point I'm making is that fighting for majority hash turned out to be the incorrect method, especially after XT and Classic had both already fought for majority hash in their own way (in the form of marked blocks). This method of ""fighting for the hashrate"" failed 3 times over at this point. It was only until Bitcoin ABC took it by the reigns and forced a fork that we achieved one."

Seems perfectly reasonable, considering.

"THANK YOU! I am getting so sick of everybody shitting all over satoshi and making totally crazy statement about where the power lies in the system.

Miners mine as long as there are users making transactions and users buying coins. But you can have a network without users using it, but not users without a network. Therefore just like you said devs have to ask both miners and users what they want, and asking miners is a bit easier and miners should know what is good for users anyway. 
Nakamoto consensus should be understood by EVERYBODY. It's so simple, you vote with hash power, end of story and you vote what is best for the miner - users relationship. 

miners and users together should pay devs, devs work for them. "
"As I mentioned in another comment that you left, I agree with what you just wrote.  I am not trying to rewrite history.

As you point out, nobody on the other teams was particularly invested in ""doing everyone else's job"" (which implies that you thought it was Amaury's job to fix the DAA.)

Thomas appears to have a persistent beef with the way Amaury selected the DAA.  I do not dispute that Amaury's decision process was somewhat hasty and rogue.  However I admire it regardless.  What I saw is that Amaury did at least some due diligence with known Bitcoin Cash miners to test the ABC DAA.  That may have been insufficient according to Thomas, but it was sufficient to convince the miners as well as the community, because *we did it.*

I would agree that more research and analysis is preferred to less.  However, as you pointed out, apparently nobody thought it was their job to do this research.  And as Amaury correctly pointed out, nobody *was* doing this research, but instead engaging in lots of proposals and discussions.  Help me understand if I'm misunderstanding please.

I don't hear you particularly complaining about Amaury's approach here so you and I don't really have a disagreement.  Thomas is the one who seems very strongly opinionated that Amaury is on a path to becoming Bitcoin Cash's ""nullc 2.0"" and has gone on a bit of a mudslinging campaign which I find tremendously unfair.

I find Amaury's explanation of his decision process to be wholly satisfactory.  According to him, the DAA was a problem that nobody was stepping up to fix.  You and Thomas both have basically agreed with this by stating that it wasn't your priority.  I myself saw it as a casual observer: there was a lot of community consensus that the EDA needed to be fixed, and a lot of debate but nothing was announced, and then Amaury announced his DAA.  Nobody else took the initiative to make a decision, merge code, and declare the new direction.

Instead of complaining about what Amaury did (which could use improvement, but which actually solved the problem) we should instead be demanding that more devs take initiative to fix problems and that more devs should learn from what Amaury did *right* instead of complaining about what he did *wrong* --- because unless I'm mistaken, the DAA fix was actually an incredible display of exactly how quickly the community could rally around a solution and get it implemented with a hardfork and no fallout.

We need to learn from this outstanding and unparalleled success at change management, not try to ""fix"" it too much and go back to old, comfortable ways of debating without taking decisive action...."

ABC saves us from Segwit2X had miners not agreed to segwit2X BU would have allowed the network to remove the soft fork 1MB limit in the same way it was initiated. 
FYI, BU was not writing BIPS or asking permission.  We were fighting for majority hash.  When it became clear that that would not happen BU planned to fork, set a date and passed the BUIP055 that became Bitcoin Cash.  ABC was the first implementation of it so has gotten a lot of momentum, but BU had a release before the fork date.
/u/chaintip
Preventing access by limiting to a maximum of 1MB total transactions is censorship. 
">  It wouldn't be fair to make them compete against normal low fee near instant transactions.

Actually, artificially increasing the cost of on-chain transactions makes it unfair competition; to make it fair, on-chain and off-chain should compete on their merits, no artificial handicaps. The only reason people are even considering off-chain (and other chains) is because Core artificially crippled on-chain."

"> no known distributed algorithm exists for solving the problem

> these changes can be canceled with payments going in the reverse direction

Consider the typical user who receives a salary once a month and then spends it piecewise during that month.  Most of the time, the payments through his channels will be all in the same direction (out).

> This is multiple orders of magnitude the number of nodes that currently exist, so it's hardly an immediate scale requirement.

The word ""node"" has different meanings in bitcoin and the LN.  In the latter, a ""node"" is just a user.  (In bitcoin, it used to mean ""miner"", but was redefined to mean the non-mining relays added -- without justification -- after Satoshi left.) 

It is hard to estimate the number of active of bitcoin users, but optimistically they are several million.  Thus a million nodes is what the LN should handle *now*.

Moreover, the LN is meant to let bitcoin scale, faster than Moore's Law; so what matters is how it would handle hundreds of millions of users, not a few thousand.

> But it's several times better than miner and node scaling, which is what matters. 

A path finding node in the LN will need to handle **more** traffic and do **more** work than a miner would do in bitcoin, for the same amount of payments.  That's because each LN payment will require 5-10 channel payments.  That will quite likely cancel the reduction in traffic due to the use of intervals.

> ou can also have light LN clients that behave similarly to SPV.

Only if they delegate path finding to some (ahem) trusted service.  

Note that the owner of that service may screw users by routing paths through several middlemen nodes that belong to him.

> Only the capacity change, which can be fuzzed and has no reason to include the sender or receiver of the transaction (which isn't even known with onion routing).

Onion routing will only hide the IPs of the computers who are sending the messages.  Still, the path finders will know about all path payments that they are asked to find, and about any significant payments done anywhere in the network.

When Alice buys an RPG from Zoe's hobby shop, the path finder that Alice consulted will know that LN node 111552 made an LN payment of about $1200 to LN node 552551, which went through nodes 230001, 333111, and 404040.  And every path finder in the world will know that payments of about $1200 went through the channels 111552-->230001, 230001-->333111, 333111-->404040, and 404040-->552551.  

Path finding will not be possible if that  information is obfuscated.  Once the KGB (who will happen to be running that path finding service) determines that node 111552 is Alice and node 552551 is Zoe...

> >  A failure rate of 1% may be high enough to drive users away.

> That just means that occasionally a payment takes 2x or 3x the amount of time to happen. Since usually payments will take a few seconds that means a 3x delay takes maybe 10 or 15 seconds, I don't think anyone will stop using the system because of that. 

No, ""failure"" means the system will not be able to find a working path between you and the merchant, even though you still have enough funding left in your channels.  If that happens once every 100 payments, people wil not use it.

> > the selected middlemen nodes must ""freeze"" the relevant channels until the payment is negotiated and executed, or the negotiation fails.

> This only takes a few seconds. 

We shall see.  The nodes in a K-hop path must exchange K messages (or maybe 2K or more, not sure) and the messages may use onion routing.

If two path finders choose to use the same middleman X at the same time, one of the paths will fail.  This is likely to happen many times if X is near a popular user, like a shop.  

If there are (only) a million users, each making one LN payment per day, there will be ~50 LN payments per second happening, which may mean 200 channel payments per second.  Many of these channel payments will have to be broadcast *promptly*, as separate messages, to all path finders.  

> Why do you think this is a significantly different from BGP routing on the Internet?  

Internet routing is a completely different problem from finding payment paths in the LN.  For one thing, there is no concept equivalent to the balance of payment channes, and no need to broadcast information about every packet hop to every gateway in the world.  Internet packets travel one hop at a time: there is no need to negotiate the entire path from scratch, with all gateways, before sending each packet.  Each telecom company that owns and operates a part of the physical network has a central server that knows the IPs of its users and how to phisically reach them; and it will send packets addressed for other IPs to other telecom companies that it has gateways to. 

More generally, the LN has no concept of physical network.  It abstracts the internet as a complete communications network: that is, it assumes that sending a **message** from any user to any user is an atomic operation.  Even so, a suitable path finding algorithm for the LN is still missing."
