Replace “CEO of a bank” with “Chairman of the Fed.”
"As long as they are providing custodial services, bank executives also could set up subsidiaries to compete with Coinbase. However, like Barnes & Noble executives watching Amazon with mild bemusement a quarter-century ago—""Wh*aaat* doth that scallywag think he art doing? The lad must be mad as a hatter! harrumpf, harrumpf, harrumpf""—bank executives are watching cryptocurrency users get used to doing business without them."
+1, this was an amazing breakdown. Thanks.
"It's a bit hard for me to fathom banks making loans in Bitcoin. I know your premise is ""bitcoin WILL stabilize one day"", but bankers won't have the huge benefits they currently get from fractional reserve banking. Being able to take the same monies and loan it many times over will no longer be possible since the coins are unique. They can loan your coins but they can do it only once. It is effectively loaning one asset for another, where the assets only differ in their liquidity.

The rates would be quite steep because they have to split the return with you. Any upward shift in coin valuation will destroy their interest return."
">	Just one example “need” that banks could fulfill is simple custody of crypto like they hold peoples cash. Most people’s security sucks, and holding an asset who’s properties include irreversibility of transactions is extremely risky for the mainstream.

This opens the door to your Bitcoin being seized.

Another function they can provide is the “putting your money to work for you” one. Like it or not, the price of bitcoin WILL stabilize one day. And people don’t want to lock up their cash or anything else in an asset that does nothing. Some might want to take on a small amount of risk to earn interest on their deposits, without having a huge amount of single counterparty risk. Banks can spread their crypto their portfolios of thousands to millions of loans and have the infrastructure and expertise in place to mange crypto based loans as well.

This opens the door for the banks to lose your Bitcoin

The banks work with the government to control the flow of money to prevent illegal activity. Decentralized currencies allow money to be sent to anywhere in the world without control. To use an example, there are some countries that have sanctions imposed on them and participating governments have an obligation to prevent the flow of money to these countries. The lack of control will be something that governments will want to be change before the integration of a crypto currency will take place. For this reason centralized crypto currencies will be integrated whereas Bitcoin will always exist outside government control, hence, wont be fully integrated into a countries banking system."
True, and yet many behave like dinosaurs nonetheless. 
"Lol ever spoken to someone working for a bank about crypto
I have his answer was : its a scam, its a bubble, its shit . XD
Nice man but he hates btc "
much better
Or FIAT plebs
OP sounds like Yoda
"The big banks could care less about crypto regulation. Their efforts have been focused on Dodd-Frank rollbacks because that impacts their bottom-lines astronomically compared to any crypto-friendly regulation. They have no interest in fighting change with crypto regulation, and there have been no federal changes to regulations that apply to digital assets, aside from FinCEN interpretive guidance in 2013 and a notice from the IRS in 2014.

All of the big banks are qualified custodians and do provide custodial services. Are you referring to acting as an exchange or an alternative trading system? All of the big banks have a broker-dealer subsidiary that together with other affiliates could provide Coinbase-like services. "
They could do the custody thing, but the market is far too small for them to be concerned with at this point.  Which also reflects on their lack of panic about not being involved on the retail transaction front. 
"If banks behaved like dinosaurs we’d still be running into a branch every time we need to make a withdrawal.  Banks are resistant to change , at the time allowing phone banking was controversial amongst executives and now we can pay by NFC. 

The demand has to be their though because they are risk adversive. Adoption is key to that, once they realise they’re missing out they’ll be forced to make new products  "
"A lot of it has to do with regulators and unclear laws

No one wants to be the first to fully embrace it , only to get billion dollar fines in the future "
"Yes I do. I work in finance. Are you talking to sales people or to lower analysts. Any C-level people I’ve spoken to pretty much keeping an eye on it to see how it will impact either currency or operations. Try talking to the right people I guess? 

For clarity, I work on the investment side but I deal with people on the banking side pretty often. Also part of a few finance societies and the focus on tech (and hence crypto) has been booming lately."
"LOL, ever spoken to someone, supporting BCH, about Bitcoin, Lightning, ETH, Monero, or other crypto?

I have. His answer was: It's a bubble, it's shit, it's the new world order/AXA, it never will work.

XD Nice man, but they hate other coins."
Let me guess, they believe in the blockchain but not in bitcoin.
I used to do that... then I learned [the grammatical rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...) for using ellipsis and commas.
Haha very true :)
Bitcoin is a store of value coin now. And it's so insignificant that it's not a threat to banking in anyv way shape or form. Especially bch.
If this post speaks to the nature of the way people think in this sub, you cunts are daft
Bank will go on as always
This is just.... not true lol 
Continue the myth that bankers can't buy up Bitcoin and get rich doing so, and that they'll never offer have Bitcoin-related offerings. That one day the bankers of the world will be on hands and knees begging for scraps from their crypto-gods. If I was a banker, I'd love that rhetoric, given that they're more focused on money than upvotes.
Asking a BTC hodler what they think about Bitcoin is like... what?
It's like asking Taylor Swift what she thinks of her ex boyfriends.
Why........ Do people...........use unnecessary..... Amounts of......periods.......?
Hmm, maybe more like 'bitcoin to banks is like uber to taxi ranks'.
this is so retarded. stop
Except, Uber makes your life better.
[deleted]
"For further insights, you should know that here on Brazil, taxi drivers actually went the physical aggression route many times over Uber drivers and passengers

Let it sink for a minute"
So many discontent but I like the joke, seems quite spicy to me 
 subtle comparison 
Ask Jamie Dimon what he thinks. Then ask him again the next day.
"Not especially. Uber is obviously incompatible with the taxi business. Banking can be adapted to work with bitcoin, just as it works with dollars, euros and everything else.

I could go on, but I’ll stop here "
Asking a bank ceo what he thinks about bitcoin is like asking a king what he thinks about democraty
