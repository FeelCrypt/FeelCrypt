"I received BCH from Coinbase because I had BTC stored there on Aug 1st. There may be millions of customers like me who got ""free money"" (correct me if I'm wrong).

How does Coinbase back this with fiat?"
"Is it correct that you still can't trade BCH on CoinBase? If so, is there an ETA for when this will happen?

Can't seem to find anything on their Twitter and the subreddit is a shit-show ATM."
"Since Coinbase currently disabled BCH buying could I then do this:

- Deposit USD on Coinbase

- Send to GDAX

- Set a limit order and buy BTC

- Use Shapeshift to BCH

- ???

- HODL"
Except you canâ€™t buy or sell. ðŸ‘Œ nice.
