Can someone with a lot of twitter followers post this link to bring attention to this gigantic display of petty insecurity from the mods?
i just sent a 10 sat/b transaction though
how is r/bitcoin still not removed by reddit admins?!
No body cares about the poor their involvement in bitcoin is insignificant. So I wouldn't change a multi billion currency for some bums in egypt.
I can't agree with this more. The crypto space is rife with unacknowledged privilege and it's depressing. Discussions of class and access have been silenced by many. That's why I applaud what maiden.global is doing
"Some banks started closing accounts of people withdrawing money from crypto-currency. They will not just do business with us. It's not just a rumor, they really do it and one of the banks is a big name: ING Bank.
Bankers are really pissed off."
"Actually though what bank are they using that charges those fees?

Even using money gram you have to send a few thousand dollars to get that big a fee, and a few thousand USD in the Philippines goes a long way."
This is a use case that Ripple is working to solve with their technology and XRP.  They are already quite far down the line in this.   More competition in the space good, but BCH has a lot of catch up not only in this area but in speed as well. 
The solution to the problem of remittances is block chain which doesn’t require bitcoin, it can be solved with any international currency.
Wow.. that post sounded like it supported the fact that you can send funds for < $20...  That's pretty crazy censorship.
actually this post isnt true. the rich need bitcoin as well. for now, they are allowed to make transfers. this may stop one day.
they are cunts
The emotional reactions in the crypto currency community are so telling of why the market is insanely volatile. Great reason to not invest, thanks for clarifying!
The market has decided that they rather want bitcoin to be a store of value.. I don't like it,  but that's just what it is.. But it is totally unacceptable to censor this sort of thing. 
Replying a mere 8 words in this thread got me banned.  They are getting more and more thin skinned.  There are a lot of people there who think things are seriously wrong and are doubting and they are getting more and more desperate.  The more BCH continues to flourish the more pressure builds on them.  I can't see how they can contain this much longer.
"If you don't understand the value proposition of the single most secure store of value ever, look at this survey of 1000 Americans: https://lendedu.com/blog/investing-in-bitcoin

Only 8% of survey responders bought Bitcoin to use for transactions. 92% plan to HODL it as a long term investment.

You tell me where the economic majority will go. The markets are clear, BTC is the winner."
Omisego (omg) will solve this problem once it rolls out.
TOP LEVEL TROLLING :D:D
Ditch Bitcoin for alts. Asic resistant coins are the future of crypto. 
"""The rich do not need Bitcoin"" That shit sounds like a populist speech of party communist left and Latin American socialist"
"you can join my sub reddit,  theres no censorship

Oh that’s why the comments were yellow! When did I get gilded?
It's like sum1 hasn't heard of Paypal friends and family...0%
yea the poor person has to wait for the mem pool to clear now.  In a few months it will be instant and near feeless making bitcoin cash only for the elite that need their coffee purchases settled on chain
"Bitcoin took off because it was a good store of value. It protected people against insane money printing by the central banks.

Not because I could spend it on bs consumer products that are over priced for what they are. 

I don’t need to trade my bitcoin for coffee. I can use the dollar for that.

If you can’t solve that problem, then you don’t deserve to exist.

If you want to help the poor, buy stellar."
Bitcoin is “storage of value” not a “payment method”
"Bitcoin is a commodity and just for investors. 

No one will ever use it to buy goods and services. Who would buy a car with bitcoin in November when that same amount of bitcoin could be worth a yacht in December? 

Bitcoin is just complicated and volatile gold. 

It will be a very long time before the technology helps poor people. "

Good job mods."

"hahhahaha /u/bashco you're such a sucker! 

r/segwitcoin has no clue how to censor like a real secret police does."
Deleted a great quote because it was by CSW. Goebbels would be proud
"Regarding the actual topic in the post:
$40 sounds insane. Is it really that expensive?
Isn’t there a bunch of free money transfer services these days? Heard about stuff like Venmo and Square Cash, or even solutions through Paypal. Aren’t they free? (I don’t know just asking for info here)

If there is cheap alternatives - but the argument is that many people find them too complicated to use - wouldn’t they find BitCoin too complicated as well?"
It's a false premise there are cheap and fast ways to send money both from outside of the Philippines and inside the Philippines. Very cheap and a hell of a lot more convenient the BCH/BTC whatever and no where near 40% fees. Total nonsense. I live in the Philippines (from America). The BTC/PHP rate given by the exchanges are shit anyway, even without fees. And yes, using a foreign ATM card from Charles Schwab is one of the best ways. No ATM fees (they refund them) and the exact Visa exchange rate which is very close to the wholesale, it doesn't get any better than this. www.transferwise.com is also great. Stop using supposedly disenfranchised poor people to promote crypto, it's nonsense. The people who don't have accounts here do so not because they can't, they just don't know any better and have no use for it often. They need education more than crypto fucking currency. Rookies. The idiot in that screenshot is using a standard wire transfer that's about the worst way to send money to anyone in any country. In the Philippines there are 100's of options better than this. In fact I don't even believe that poster really send money to his mother that way, EVERYONE here knows better ways than a freaking wire-transfer. Remittance is a way of life.
"I've been meaning to ask, and this inspires me to do so:

Can someone explain what exactly is up with this /r/bitcoin thing? Pretend I know nothing. 

I'm just a small investor myself. "
"Interesting - as of writing this is the15th highest post on the [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com)  fronpage!

/u/maaku7 answer is the best, he suggests using a bank! LOL
**This is censorship. Not moderation.**
Satoshi Nakamoto himself could have made a reddit account, posted that and it would have been removed.  The bankers are in the bitcoin driving seat now.  Satoshi's vision hinders them.
[removed post](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7dxxfe/the_rich_dont_need_bitcoin_the_poor_do_i_already)
Upvoted to help bring this to front page. I don't like r/btc because I don't find the community any more friendly than r/bitcoin but censorship is something else, especially when it comes to money investment. I made my own research, came to r/btc, r/cryptocurrency and I still decided to invest in BTC, but to think that a subreddit with as much traffic would try to hide information to newbies whatever the reason is disgusting to another level.
"Clearly r/Bitcoin is controlled by the rich, not the people. So the ban is completely in line with their intentions past present and future.

"
Sooo....Ripple XRP?
"1. Why should someone remove a post like this?

2. If mods are sensoring stuff in this subreddit why don't we all just unsubscribe and mive to another subreddit?"
"I'm having trouble finding a good way of sending money back home from overseas. Does anyone know a good alternative?

The only problem is I live in China"
Bitcoin won’t help the poor at all, sending $25 and paying $8 in fees won’t work. Bitcoin is a storing asset, not P2P. BCH would be the true solution. 
r/bitcoin mods are rude, arrogant, and speak untruths (although I genuinely believe that they believe their own propaganda)
"What a bunch of ****s

/u/tippr gild"
Lets fork /r/bitcoin !
There are ways around transfer fees.  Also, at least real money can be spent and brick and mortar locations, unlike btc which is much more sketchy.
You guys don't get it, it's all about trickle-down technology.
"/r/bitcoin is an ongoing tragedy, and the owners who host the environment in which it unfolds (both mods and admins) put profit and person gains ahead of most every other ideal and purpose

awful"
I'm glad there's a place a healthy debate about the future of bitcoin can flourish. Its the mark of an intellectual to be able to entertain an opposing view without necessarily completely rejecting or accepting it.
