Funny- literally just saw news of this elsewhere.  Had a feeling this would be on r/btc ... came right over here to check my premonition..... TOP NEWS?!?! Sad.  Bitcoin-hate is the top news in a BCH-driven subreddit?  SMH
"Tax plan passed which increased the debt by a trillion and in turn weakens the dollar.

BTC has more value than a USD as demonstrated by the upwards surge. Its scarce because theres a finite amount where our shit US govt keeps printing money. When you have more and more of something the value spreads out accordingly.

If enough people places value on something ...it can be traded. It has value.

Unless bitcoin drops off the #1 spot it's going potentially delay crypto adoption by years. Bitcoin Cash will never be the solution, it'll always cause confusion by living in the shadow of the original bitcoin.

Screw you, /u/bitpay. Scorched earth or what is this shit about? You're damaging the whole crypto space and ruining it for everybody. Support Bitcoin Cash and a couple of alt-coins already.
Good job Core and supporters! You're so far successful on your path of destroying Bitcoin.

Sounds like Bitcoin Core is finally losing Steam.
Fix the transaction fee problem and the hemorrhaging will stop.
Good
Cough cough Bitcoin crash imment cough cough
"> As of today, Steam will no longer support Bitcoin as a payment method on our platform due to high fees and volatility in the value of Bitcoin.
> 
> In the past few months we've seen an increase in the volatility in the value of Bitcoin and a significant increase in the fees to process transactions on the Bitcoin network. For example, transaction fees that are charged to the customer by the Bitcoin network have skyrocketed this year, topping out at close to $20 a transaction last week (compared to roughly $0.20 when we initially enabled Bitcoin). Unfortunately, Valve has no control over the amount of the fee. These fees result in unreasonably high costs for purchasing games when paying with Bitcoin. The high transaction fees cause even greater problems when the value of Bitcoin itself drops dramatically.
> 
> Historically, the value of Bitcoin has been volatile, but the degree of volatility has become extreme in the last few months, losing as much as 25% in value over a period of days. This creates a problem for customers trying to purchase games with Bitcoin. When checking out on Steam, a customer will transfer x amount of Bitcoin for the cost of the game, plus y amount of Bitcoin to cover the transaction fee charged by the Bitcoin network. The value of Bitcoin is only guaranteed for a certain period of time so if the transaction doesn’t complete within that window of time, then the amount of Bitcoin needed to cover the transaction can change. The amount it can change has been increasing recently to a point where it can be significantly different.

> The normal resolution for this is to either refund the original payment to the user, or ask the user to transfer additional funds to cover the remaining balance. In both these cases, the user is hit with the Bitcoin network transaction fee again. This year, we’ve seen increasing number of customers get into this state. With the transaction fee being so high right now, it is not feasible to refund or ask the customer to transfer the missing balance (which itself runs the risk of underpayment again, depending on how much the value of Bitcoin changes while the Bitcoin network processes the additional transfer).

> At this point, it has become untenable to support Bitcoin as a payment option. We may re-evaluate whether Bitcoin makes sense for us and for the Steam community at a later date.

"Honestly they are right

Even Satoshi said the system was about low fees

But what happened is the number for fees remained the same as the price increased whereas the mining fee should’ve decreased.

I guess they may adopt Bitcoin Cash? Living the real concept"
I wonder how many other merchant will look at things like this and be less likely to look into crypto as a means of payment as a result.
"> Less than two years after adopting Bitcoin as a payment option on Steam, Valve has announced that it is dropping support for the virtual currency. The decision to eliminate the option comes as a result of both the extremely high transaction fees charged by Bitcoin, and recent, also-extremely-high levels of instability in its value.

See what you've done, Blockstream Core?"
Can't blame them, currencies are supposed to be stable and bitcoin is currently anything but stable. 
I mean...I wouldn’t take it as currency either. It’s too volatile. If the price goes down tomorrow then it loses half its value or whatever. It will go down, just how much is the question.

I presume most people here knew about this already.

The TL;DR is the IRS considers BTC property and is taxed as such. 

Due to its soaring price merchants are ditching it because of the potential tax burden."
Waiting for the BTC bubble to burst is like waiting for the new season of Thrones. It's been a long wait, but it's gonna be one hell of a ride once it starts up.
This news basically shook my last bit of hope for btc. Just bought a ton of Bitcoin Cash and bought some precious metals with the rest of it
TIL steam supports Bitcoin.
CONSOLIDATED EFFORT TO INFORM THEM ABOUT BITCOIN CASH: BEGIN!!!
Sinne gaming has always been setting trends this is terrible news and i cant blame it on steam to be fair. 
Steam will accept another Cryptocurrency. It’s just a matter of which one
