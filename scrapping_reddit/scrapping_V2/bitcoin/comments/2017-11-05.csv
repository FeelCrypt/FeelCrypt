There are very well established examples of hyperinflation for fiat currency too. The assumption that the USD or EUR will never end up like the Mark (rapidly and violently), the Lira (to a much lesser extend and in a longer timespan) or the country that adopted a fiat currency for the first time in history: 1947-1948 China is more a wish than a certainty

It has actually taken me years to really absorb the ramifications of this technology, let alone understand it, and there is no question that there is so much more to get. It is pure genius.

I have my own interpretation of the bitcoin invention, that I think reflects my understanding. Maybe I'm just talking shit, but I reckon it's at least a little bit internally consistent. I'm building on it, because it helps clarify it for me.

This is actually a game theory problem. There are three groups in bitcoin. The users, the holders, and the miners. To understand the way that relationship works, you have to understand what keeps everyone separated and honest. That requires an understanding of the incentives of bitcoin, and that requires understanding what [proof-of-work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work_system) is.

Proof-of-work aligns consensus with the users, because it is the users that are paying the miners. Even holders require users, and more importantly, node owners. Therefore, it is users that are incentivizing the miners. [Proof-of-stake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-stake) aligns consensus with the holders, who are paying the miners. That is an incentive structure that reflects our current financial system. But bitcoin changes this through incentive structures and cryptography. In bitcoin, it is the incentive of the payers, not the paid, that imo is the wild invention of satoshi, and enacted through cryptography.

PoS fails because there is only one outcome given that incentive structure. Holders being miners, and then controlling the users. PoW overcomes this because the outcome is the constant tension between all three.

At the heart of the solution is the byzantine generals problem. The problem is ""if you are a number of generals surrounding a castle, how do you give the attack date and ensure that the message to attack is correctly received, when you know that the message may be altered along the way?"". There's game theory around what is possible, but that's the gist of it. I have reduced it to three. Given you know one is a traitor, how do you deliver the message to attack?

The way that this is managed is that miners order the transactions, and race to hash them to an algorithm (the work in proof-of-work), which is in bitcoin, SHA-256, until they get an answer that they will be accepted by the nodes (proof). They are incentivized to become more and more efficient, and spend more resources as the price increases. The nodes provide the proof in proof-of-work. For that work, the nodes award miners bitcoin. The nodes can prove which miner spent more work, but it sometimes takes a few blocks to get it right, which is why you have to wait for a few confirmations.

The only real thing that miners can threaten to do is stop users (the people paying them) from receiving blocks. Users and holders, after all, control their own cryptographic proofs to the tokens. But the current miners are only miners of SHA-256 pow algorithm blocks. In an adversarial condition, the miners will have just stopped coming to the party, so the users say 'fuck this' and change the pow. They get a new set of miners, mining a new algorithm, and the holders go 'holy shit, do I wanna spend my cash with a bunch of numpties that couldn't behave themselves?'. And they start spending their cash on the chain that the users say is the real one, and everyone just goes about their business again. Old miners get crushed. New miners think happy days. If the nodes change their software, that's the end of the story. Because the nodes define the consensus, they can. The remaining node owners get to decide whether they want to be owned by the miners, or whether they actually want to still remain users. The holders decide whether they are more likely to be able to realize their money with the miners that now control a drastically centralized subset of nodes, or to continue on in the system that led to their being holders in the first place.

Users can't attack the system, because then they would become holders, and users would no longer trust them for the reasons already stated, and they don't hold the cryptographic proofs of the holders. If the holders do that, they lose all of their users, so the only thing they game-theory-wise would do, would be to instate a pow. Why would anyone prefer a system in which the people with the money have all of the power? Otherwise known as the world financial system.

Whoever attacks loses, and there's no real way to cheat the system. That's the brilliant solution to the byzantine generals problem. It is a self-sustaining financial system that rewards everyone for participating in it, where incentives are perfectly aligned for its longevity, with an ever reducing supply of tokens that are effectively infinitely divisible, increasing their value per-capita. And no, there isn't any other system in the world that shares these properties.

Which part of ETH is modern? The one where all the wallets lock up for days? Sorry it's a joke. Not to mention smart contracts are coming to bitcoin through side chains. Ones with less attack surface. Side chains are what you would call modern design, a modular one. Not a monolithic one which can be hacked.
Financial institutions are willing to make a profit off it, that doesn't mean they accept it. They are actually much more open to more modern superior blockchains like Ethereum that will eventually supersede Bitcoin. I have a little over 1 bitcoin, I have skin in this game, but it's just all hype right now and as soon as cryptocurrencies become a serious competitor to fiat currency, Governments will either ban its use as a money or people will flip to a superior blockchain (following what companies are currently doing with Ethereum).

Aaaand you're wrong.  I have a bitcoin debit card.  I was drinking beers with it last night. 
My stocks in NVDA and AMD have been doing quite well over the past few years, much more stable than bitcoin too.
"The ""game"" was ahead of its time. I used to leave it on in the background and randomly teleport to clubs with live DJs. Interactive way of listening to random music "
"Yes, the exchange still exists: 

https://www.virwox.com

This was actually how I first learned of Bitcoin. Unfortunately Linden shut down sale of Linden Dollars for Bitcoin within maybe 6 months, iirc. I’d been making around $600/year from SL from around 2009-20011 and had tried to setup an account at VirWox, but by the time I got it ready they disabled Bitcoin. You had to create an account on the website, then go link it from in world. 

Some time later, fall of 2013, I came across Bitcoin again and went with Coinbase and then got swept up by the tech and it’s been quite a ride! But, well, that’s my ‘what if’ story. Tbh, it would be really trippy to have millions of dollars of Bitcoin from selling virtual goods in Second Life. "
In this case the celebrity is talking about something that happened to them rather than some random event. I think it's pretty reasonable unless the claim has some huge ramifications outside their lives.
A lot of people would take that opportunity to buy.
"> Bitcoin was far less volatile 2 years ago than it has been in its last 6 months. I mean seriously look at this graph and tell me you think its getting less volatile.

That graph is linear.  Switch it to a log and look again.

Even better, take a look at actual volatility measurements.  That is, measurements  that show the amount of change (percentage) occurring within a defined period compared to other equal length defined periods.  There has indeed been a small up-tick recently, but overall the trend is towards lower volatility.  One good place to see it in a nice chart is https://bitvol.info/

> Also ""acceptance"" of bitcoin isn't going up. There has been no overall growth in daily transactions in the last year. All that has gone up is the price people are willing to pay, because they all believe its going to be worth more in the future than it is now.

I personally know a lot more people who own bitcoin now than I did a year ago.  It's now talked about more in newspapers and television, accepted by more businesses, and public awareness is generally higher.  I'll agree that the number of transactions doesn't seem to have greatly risen (although over a two year timespan, there is a noticeable upwards trend), but given that it's a store of value that promotes holding rather than spending, I'm not overly surprised by that.

> If you think volatility is a measure of success then coins like Ethereum, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash are all less volatile/more successful.

I never said that volatility is a measure of success.  You seem to be trying to set up a strawman here.  That said, lower volatility is an expected outcome of increasing success, and also a requirement for certain use cases that aren't practical right now (such as pricing things in BTC directly).

Taking a look at the data, Ethereum and Litecoin have similar volatility to BTC (sometimes a bit higher, sometimes a bit lower).  Bitcoin Cash on the other hand is significantly more volatile.  So I'm not sure where you're getting the idea they're all less volatile than Bitcoin.

> If bitcoin started crashing there is no way you could pull your money out before all the largest financial interests had already pulled their money out.

As I already said though, I have no intention of ""pulling my money out"" unless I am completely convinced bitcoin will fall to zero and *never* recover.  It could crash to $1/BTC tomorrow on the news of every world government declaring it illegal and shutting down every exchange and I'd just buy more because I believe in the fundamental value of the system.

> Treating bitcoin as a speculative asset is not the revolution in economics you think it is.

Another strawman... what makes you think I treat it as a speculative asset or that I'd consider that aspect of it to be a revolution in economics?

> It was meant to be a decentralized currency but people treat it as a get rich quick scheme.

I find it somehow strange that you end your post with this statement.  You're the one treating it as a valueless thing that only has use in trading and has a price held up by speculation alone.  I'm the one arguing for its inherent value.

Yes, I expect that based on my understanding of the system, economic theory, and human behaviour that I will eventually be extremely rich from my BTC holdings; and yes, that is one of the reasons I have the BTC that I do.  But the main reason I have and use BTC is because its a decentralised currency where I and I alone am in control of my money."
"> Everyone seems to be aware that the more acceptance bitcoin gets, the greater the value

If that were true these people would all be buying dollars.

> I personally think we're already at a point where the value of bitcoin is almost (but still not quite) large enough for it to be a 'safe' investment

Oh come off it. The higher it gets the far more likely people will dump it to take their profit. At which point it's likely to drop, possibly to dive if people panic.

"> That's the rub. What's the point of a currency If it's a gamble? If it's not guaranteed to have any value it's not valuable.

This argument can and probably has been used on every major branch of technological advancement. When I read this I am reading argument against the internet. I am reading an argument against the selling of or ownership of digital goods. I am reading an argument about how its bad to take power away from the legacy media.

""Photographs taken with digital cameras are not real photography. If you cant hold the photo in your hands then you cant really have ownership of it. And thus it has no real value.""

I get what a lot of you guys with these counter arguments are doing. You are properly question a new idea. However, I strongly suggest you keep in mind that this is not a new phenomenon."
"We could take a hint from r/litecoin and start running phone call campaigns to get more companies to accept btc. 

Another big issue is that it needs to be instant. I buy games from steam with btc all the time, but Its a lot slower than a credit card transaction, and a lot more technical. The layman isn't going to want to copy and paste an address or even scan a qr code. We need an instant verification process, that will probably come in the form of a 2nd layer like ln."
"News outlets are supposed to research their articles before publishing them, instead of just assuming that everything that a celebrity says is 100% accurate. 

In this case, the sum total of the research done appears to have been reading a single tweet and doing a google search for 'bitcoin'."

Plenty disappeared. Others generated billions in revenue by creating products and services. Bitcoin isn't going to do the latter is it? If its price drops then it's worthless and remains so."

Yeah, good luck on getting that $1.4 billion out of it. That's the part nobody looks at or talks about.
Bitcoin as a currency has been stagnant for the past year. Bitcoin as a speculative bubble has been expanding rapidly
"I think bitcoin will finally separate the good debt from the bad debt. It is my personal belief ( as in i don't know of any formal theory ) that debt should only be incurred for the use of building a productive asset. In a deflationary currency, this encourages businesses to ensure that productivity increases will have greater returns than savings. Instead, our financial system has encouraged the acquisition of debt for fixed assets. The only thing this has done us bid up the price of those fixed debts with debt, and handed over the money for supporting that system to banks. In order to stimulate growth in such a system, the only way that you can function is to tax savings. That's what inflation is.

Bitcoin will eventually stabilize to an ever appreciating value asset. But what it will allow you to do is save for a house. If you have a business proposal that encourages people to pay you for a good or service, people will invest their savings in it and take on that risk.

That's the way it is supposed to work i think. "

"Yes, I agree 100%. Crypto transactions are really cumbersome from a UX experience. That is certainly the biggest hurdle right now. People need to be able to buy crypto and transfer it in maybe like one or two steps for it to really replace credit cards.

Maybe she thought it was an imaginary currency that had no worth? If I asked you to do whatever your job is for a full shift for me, for 100,000 dollars in monopoly money, I think you might turn me down. 
There was a guy on Reddit that random handed out Bitcoin tips of like 5BTC around 5 years ago. There was a comment section full of huge tips. Even then, that was a lot of money.
