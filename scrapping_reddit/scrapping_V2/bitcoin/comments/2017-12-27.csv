"Geez, this tweet is making its way everywhere. (Yup that's my tweet)

Couple of things that've come up that I'll try to answer:

I really don't get why people think I would have killed myself over this whole bitcoin thing. There's literally no amount of money that Bitcoin could go to that would justify that. There are worse things that can happen in your life than selling something too early and if something like this is the worst thing that ever happens to you in your life, consider yourself really lucky.

Money is just money, a means to an end. Does it sting that I could have had an insane amount of money? Sure. Does it keep me up at night? Not at all, mostly it just makes me feel a bit stupid for not understanding what I was seeing at the time to hold, even before HODL was a meme. Seriously, I looked it up and HODL's from a December 18, 2013 Bitcoin Talk Forums post.

Am I doing alright? Yeah, mostly because I have a decent job.

Do I hold crypto? Really small amounts of some low market cap coins with technology that I like. The bulk of what I had remaining from playing with crypto early on got sold recently to pay off my student loans and credit cards. Not the payday that others have gotten, but it's had a positive effect on my life, I'm sure my credit is going to improve once it all registers. Now I mostly keep up to date with crypto to see what's going on and if there are any new interesting coins with cool technology. But I'm not throwing much money at it, nor do I really intend to.

To be honest I didn't get into crypto to make some huge payday, I don't think many of us did that early. It was a new technology to play around with, something we'd never really seen before. So we dropped a hundred bucks on Mt.Gox and did some trading, trying to see how it all worked. Traded to paper wallets, sweeped them into online wallets, sent them to friends, bought pizzas, played SatoshiDice. I didn't recognize what it all meant until much, much later.

Do I remember what I spent it on? The $0.30 sell wasn't the last of my trades, I think I made like $1k once I did finally pull the bulk of my account out of Mt.Gox into my bank account, it probably went to rent or other random purchases. I was mostly happy I came out ahead."
This is the best mindset. Nobody *needs* $25 million (Barring bizarre and unique situations...), but a lot of people do really really need a car.
And today you wouldn‚Äôt need a car haha
Her last name is Sarkisian actually
Did you buy a lambo?
It buys you a decent home on the west side of Vancouver. About 10-15 million. then you can live off the rest without being worried about your future, as long as you live like you're on payroll.

at what price did you buy back into bitcoin?

He really likes Cher.
Yea.. bought a wedding photographer / DJ for 1.5 btc in Feb '17. Could have paid for the wedding and the rest of my student loan had I waited 8 months... I hate being married (JK it's great - fucking memories though...)
yes, but if he was smart, he wouldn't have sold all of them, just most of them
wow i had no idea. then again i dont think about cher much haha
">lighting a brand new lamborghini on fire and driving it off a cliff 

After the first time you did this it would be your heirs that were the millionaires. 
"
in the next 5 years, whats a reasonable top and bottom estimate at which bitcoin could x% increase by and still be stable/not disrupt the world economy or common sense?
Gut punch. But you can't dwell on this, or else you'd go crazy. So Hodl. 
"Not quite yet. We have a little bit still until they're $40,320.

Wishing he‚Äôd bought at 0.02
This man's life is defined by this tweet. Source: his Twitter üòπ
Me too :)
Nothing, but you're not looking at the big picture. 
"Another 5 years from now it will be:

I wish I kept my 0.0001 BTC @ $120,000 instead of selling them at $190,000, now that its $1,000,000! #bitcoin"
Haha I also have 10m dollar 12 year old bmw 
"[""Haha""](https://media.giphy.com/media/w0rMSiljRj6q4/200w.gif)"
"This only means that what you have isn't worth a few million dollars yet. If you had ""enough"" you'd sell them."
"Exactly.  The approximately 1k that I have in bitcoin wouldn't be life-changing if it just went to zero, but it would be lifechanging if it got multiplied by 100, or 1000.

Edit: I meant $1000 not 1000 BTC hahaha"
answer that and I'll deliver your lambo
Back when this tweet was discovered like 6 months ago his timeline after it had no mentions of crypto at all. Then after everyone retweeted his old tweet he started tweeting again about crypto. I don't think he got back in early.
I have no idea but let me know if you get an estimate. 
And sold @ $ 140
Cher is armenian?
A lot of these penny coins are quick cash grabs market it flooded with shit coins now
Yeah true
[deleted]
wise words here
"That's true, but not 100 sports cars and models on payroll to take care of them.

$25m is the rest of your life retired and enjoying life fully."
So he's basically a martyr. 
no it won't
Stop i cant get but so erect!
yeah i sold about 15% of my bitcoin when it peaked a few days ago or whenever, but i would never sell all of them 
I bought and sold at a bunch of prices, honestly not holding too much anymore.
Nah, sadly. I wish I'd dumped a few dozen into a cold wallet and lost it until last month. I was going through some of my old machines on the lookout for wallet.dat files though.
Yeah, you‚Äôd have 100 in a climate controlled garage bigger than a Macys department store staffed by gorgeous Armenian women in skimpy outfits who say things like ‚Äúyes sir‚Äù and ‚Äúanything you need sir‚Äù. Sounds awful.

Why? So say he and the 10000 BTC pizza guy hodled instead. Why would that be worse for bitcoin, apart from lacking a cool story? If anything, the price would've risen to current levels *faster*.
Poor guy.
"Exactly. Without the 10million $ pizzas and shit like this. We would not be where we are today.

I'd send the guy $100"
You can‚Äôt lose something you don‚Äôt have. ROI is never guaranteed, and assuming it ever is is the decadence that ruins investors.
i just looked at his twitter and it seems he's still into crypto, so he's probably lambo'd
I bought a sectional off Overstock in January with my bitcoin... my sectional is worth more than my car now... but it is a comfortable sectional
or just some
"That's my plan with other cryptos. I'm going to sell either half or a quarter of my coins when they hit a certain threshold, then hodl the rest in the hopes they hit anywhere near where BTC is at now. 

Hell if some of them hit where ETH is at now I'll make a ~$60,000 profit. "
This is why I continue to hold. For me, this would be a much more difficult pill to swallow than if bitcoin were to crash to nothingness. 
"Just one comment 
Holy fucking shit "
Oddly specific 
Obviously. Thus ‚Äúcontinue to hold.‚Äù
It‚Äôs because Greg sold his bitcoin that bitcoin has reached that point. 
"It cant possibly be multiplied by one thousand. Disillusion yourself. Bitcoin would have to be worth more than all other assets combined for that to be true. Even 100x would put it to extremely absurd valuations, several times that of gold or any other single asset.

10-20x is plausible on any reasonable time frame. "
I'm not sure you realize how not far $25m can go
"If it got multiplied by 1000 the btc market cap would be like 260 trillion dollars. That's somewhere around 4x the value of all money in the world. 

That's pretty bullish. "
Honestly, I'm positive there are tons of people wishing they got in 6 months ago so I'm sure he's fine.
Lol. I bet he rebought at $100
God I don't know what I'd do with myself if that was me
"While you guys are jerking off looking at this post and claiming moronic shit...

He climate was different back then. What he did was normal and fitting for the time.

Please just shut the fuck up with your ‚Äúshould have, would have, could have‚Äù nonsense.

99% of you dumb shits would have sold"
No matter what it's clear he was gonna sell them early. 
"Sure, looking back it looks like a total loss. But why aren't you guys investing tons of money into the little penny coins now? If one of those takes off in 8 years you will all have missed it. 

Point being, no one knows the future, so you sell when you are happy.

Edit: typo"
Eh. These types of things had to happen in order for bitcoin to grow. 
[deleted]
Damn so he spent $102 for those 1,700 BTC at   $.06 each and he could've made $13,600 if he sold his BTC at $8.00 each. Those 1,700 BTC are worth $25,500,000 today! He must be hurting...
Ouch
Moral of the story, even if you plan to sell most of your Crypto at some point always leave a few coins in your wallet just in case.
