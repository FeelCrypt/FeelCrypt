"How to invest in anything:  
1) Gain an impossible amount of hindsight  
2) Go back in time to buy/hold/sell, based on what your hindsight reveals  
3) Become rich"
Opposing position, can you give an example of such event? 
Because just like bitcoin, their father hasn't been heard from in years.
In seriousness, if you're using chrome get minerblock.
i will miss this volatility meme after hyperbitcoinization
You're fine, man. Just hang on for a year or two.
Just remember, if you bought at the ATH in 2010, you'd be singing a different story... Time fixes all problems in bitcoin. 
[deleted]
Whatever ATH means?
 You stole fizzy lifting drinks. You bumped into the ceiling which now has to be washed and sterilized, so you get nothing! You lose! Good day sir! 
That's a thing I've had to learn through watching everyone ever point out how the trade they made could have been better.  It's definitively always the case that you could have made a better trade.  Take your W's, and learn from your L's. That's all it is.
Or print a Bitcoin.. 
You've got the start of a lame Etsy store now.
"people simply think in Dollar/Euro because that's what they are used to and people simply do not give a fuck what the money is called as long as it's valuable. You must not be aware of that competition and the differences between Bitcoin and FIAT, the simple fact that someone buys Bitcoin to gain from it is the whole argument for sound money from the perspective of a normal person.  

action and awareness don't have to align."
"Most of us aren't trying to get rich in Fiat.

Many believe in the philosophy surrounding Bitcoin.

**I have some Bitcoin as an insurance policy.  Much like I also keep 3 gallons of fresh water in my home in-case my water gets shut off for the day.**  Likewise, I *always* have >$1,000 of bitcoin permanently stored in my brain (memorized 12-word seed).  The fact that this is possible is mind-blowing. I could store $20,000,000 in my brain if I trusted my memory that much.

For those that aren't impressed by this, or don't appreciate how bitcoin works, this is different than ""memorizing a password to login to coinbase to access my bitcoins"".  The 12 words *are* *literally* my Bitcoins.

Small example of a bitcoin insurance policy that doesn't include the US dollar collapsing:

If I travel to Cuba and run out of whatever US cash I initially brought with me, I'm fucked.  You can't withdraw cash from a US bank account or receive a bank wire from America.  Now, I will always have enough Bitcoins to buy myself a plane ticket back to America no matter where I find myself in the world. (And before you ask, yes, you can actually use the bitcoins in Cuba to get cash - that's not just hopeful thinking).

\------------------------------

**Edit:**

Replying to ""Stranded in cuba? That's an unlikely scenario"": It happened last year to my American friend who went there on his Swedish passport.  He simply budgeted poorly, but could just as easily been pick-pocketed. He couldn't get a wire from his american bank account or from his family in Sweden. He didn't eat the last day so he would have cash for the cab to the airport.  This guy is a 25yo banker who makes over $200,000 per year. he's a smart well-connected guy. Got caught off guard.

**The value of insurance is the sum of thousands of unlikely situations in which it may become useful one day.**

* How likely is it that you become a victim of identity theft, and your bank freezes all your bank accounts? Similarly: Do you think it will get resolved in <1 week? What if it doesn't, yet you need to pay rent? Buy food
* How likely is it that i get stuck in a foreign country without cash? (As described above, happens.)
* How likely is it that you may want to withdraw more cash from an ATM than your bank will allow in 1 day (for some people, this limit is literally $500?)
* How likely is it that Visa goes down for 3 days and your credit card stops working? (Like it did in the UK just last month)
* How likely is it that your bank makes a clerical mistake and accidentally locks/freezes your credit card?
* How likely is it that the government keeps printing more money causing rapid inflation and the value of FIAt currency to keep falling? (For Americans this is unlikely, but for other countries, it is inevitable).

And yes, many of these scenarios *could* be satisfied with cash. (disclosure I also have $500 in cash in my house for this exact reason). However, you can't store that in your brain and transport it on planes without questions. It can be confiscated, stolen, burnt, etc. Storing $100,000 in your house? Riskier.

Lastly: I don't think *that* many people living in India thought that it was *likely* that their government would spontaneously decree that **all cash-bills over $20 would become illegal** **overnight.** But it happened. and it caused a massive 2-month-long run-on the banks to exchange their now illegal $100 bills for cash. That happened less than 1 year ago.

People in America probably didn't think it was likely that the government would make owning gold illegal and confiscate your stash of gold. But it happened.

Nothing seems likely untill it occurs, then you're shit out of luck.

Bitcoin is a radically new element of our world - one of those benefits is an last-resort emergency cash stash that was never previously possible."
It's still the closest anyone will ever come to happening upon $100m from near nothing. That's a psychological toll you won't get anywhere else! 
"\>You guys

Speak for yourself. The Bitcoin devs and many people in this space are working to make Bitcoin a viable alternative to fiat."
Reddcoin is still at 1 dollar stage
"Most people are missing the point of crypto networks. The immutable aspect is the cake. All information on this old Internet will be subject to AI manipulation. Things like phone calls, video and news articles can and will be manipulated by AI. Take a look at Lyrebird AI and Deepakes; AI is here. A new internet is going to form on top of one of these blockchains. There are guys working on a social app on Tezos right now and will integrate a ""social blockchain"", which will incorporate biometrics for ID verification. Think of requiring 3 confirmations from friends or family before a large transfer can leave your crypto/bank account. Integrating the telephony network into a blockchain or visa versa will instantly kill scam calls. The same goes for email and news articles. Everything will be set in silicon... who, when, where, what and how all permanently etched into an immutable ledger. Of course the networks aren't there yet, but the network that swallows all of these transactions will be worth quadrillions."
Not about invasion of privacy really, just that they are using your cpu resources for their gain. The only real downside is laggy cpu, overheating and general wear and tear
"Was it a mistake to take my kids 529 account and sink it into BTC? 

Its down about 20% since I invested it, but Ive got 10 years before he needs it! 

The market is killing it ! But the 529 Admins are killing it even more. "

"I remember being a teenager when I first heard about bitcoin. Back then I thought, ""Digital money? Hmm, that could be pretty cool."" But I had no money, so I didn't buy any. 

Life is sad, sometimes"
Hah! At least I came out ahead with my 2004 Xsara.

I’ve heard about this before but exactly what would be the negative side to altcoins being mined in the background of your PC? Aside from the whole invasion of privacy aspect. 
Reason #1 for suicide? Lollll
Used to play eve online. Heard about bitcoin right at the beginning in a game chat. Ignored it. Idiot. 
If you're telling someone to sell you either sell your own or short. 
It's just buying when another sells or vice versa. Nothing complicated.
[deleted]
That's still a large amount to trust with memory.
"Well, I got that much. But that's about as dumb as saying, ""Why didn't you play these six numbers in the lottery? It was just *that* easy.""

The fact is that 99.9% of people hadn't even *heard* about Bitcoin in 2010, let alone invest in it. Hindsight is 20/20. Can you imagine putting *real* money into an *untested* medium of exchange? Can you then imagine it gaining value a million times over? I can see its value now and still find it hard to believe.

Also, Bitcoin stock is not a thing. Unless you mean Bitcoin futures, but that wasn't even a thing until late last year."
This makes me sad.
Think of it as your car, everytime you park it someone else drives it around without you knowing, some even add extra weight to it when you drive it increasing fuel consumption.
hence the wallet sized amount in his brain. 
You wouldn’t download a car
AND, they're adopted.

"Have a couple of hard-core gamblers in my family but didn't about gambler's fallacy, had to do a quick search.

Here is what Google said ^((for the lazy among us)):

>The **gambler's fallacy**, also known as the Monte Carlo **fallacy** or the **fallacy** of the maturity of chances, is the mistaken belief that, if something happens more frequently than normal during a given period, it will happen less frequently in the future.

Source: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler%27s\_fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler%27s_fallacy)"
"That could very well be.  I was never a huge gamer, so I never really paid attention to the virtual goods markets.  

I still think it was pretty nichey, though, and in most cases aimed at filling a grey market, offering the purchase of virtual items in ways that most companies didn't like.  The big one I remember is WoW getting upset about people buying/selling gold.

Interesting, but I wouldn't have bet BTC would reach $15,000 on it.  As was, $10-$20 tops.  I remember the general consensus being that the low-$30 price was a speculative bubble that would never be reached again.

The people who believed otherwise were the ones who made some to a ton of money."
Does an adblocker stop these things?
"A bunch of my friends and I like to play around with trading stocks and crypto, and we came up with a rule that you're only allowed to say ""I Told You So"" if you take an opposing position to someone. "

If they were really smart, this would be a miner itself."
thank you
thank you very much
Past performance is no guarantee of future performance.

What about the lottery?
I'm pretty sure that's illegal.
dumb question, do I need this if I'm on a mac?
Half bad ...

Same dude, lost all mine on an old hdd because to be honest I thought I had been scammed when I bought, I purchased a btc exchange domain early on and only still have that because I forgot about it. 
i keep all my hard drives because i'm a tin foil hat wearer. I recommend it. 
It was easier to buy bitcoin stock in 2010 than it is to win the lottery, if you read the entire post
"Sure, but humans have been using Gold as an investment for 6,000 years. I kind of doubt that tomorrow we are all going to stop doing that.

There's a difference between saying Bitcoin isn't guaranteed to perform according to your expectations and saying it is going to something like zero dollars, or what Professor Bitcorn said: $10 (when it was above $1k). It's not healthy to have an extreme worldview that ignores the built-in scarcity of many of these cryptos and human behavior (our tendency to hoard scarce things)."
There were quite a few market sites back in 2010 that used btc, though. In particular for virtual goods, as btc finally combat the paypal/bank chargebacks. Btc was really an awesome invention and helped me alot back then. 
Don't do it. Is like gambler's fallacy.
so didn't have $10 which would be $2M now?
Shit, now they're worth $6.3 billion. 
2014 style bear market incoming. Hodl for 3 years!
Some people like to give advice with others' money.  My friend told me to sell at 5k, 6k, 8k, 10k, 15k etc (on the way up).  He gloats now about how he told me to sell, but I just tell him, if I sold when you first told me to, I know myself and probably would have bought back in at 10k and would be in a much worse position. 
Probably, as most of those run in JavaScript, and that runs on macOS 
"listen...  

1) hodl  
2) price skyrockets / fiat devalues  
3) merchants force hodlers at one point to spend their bitcoin because they only want sound money.    
4) moon landing / stable price

this is a process and hodling is a big part of it right now."
Some might. It's best to use noscript to be sure no extra scripts are running. It's a pain in the butt, but better to be safe.
so you are not friends anymore...
The people that will take bitcoin to mass adoption, are only in middle school right now.  
"It’s more like you bought a $5 lotto and sold it to someone else for $100, only to find out a few days later it was a powerball winner. 

It doesn’t feel too bad to buy a losing ticket for the lotto, but to have purchased a winning ticket and have sold it before the winners were announced? It feels a lot more personal."
Noscript is the nuclear option.
Better hope you don't have a brain injury or get Alzheimer's...
This really sucks to look at because if I'd known about bitcoin in 2010 I'd have been mining it during my military deployments. I didn't even hear about it until it was already in the low hundreds
I wonder what the people who bought at $20,000 feel like.
"So I have an almost identical story, and I'm perfectly okay with it.

I got into bitcoin right after it bounced to around $30-something dollars and then crashed back to a couple of dollars.  I mined a bunch, played around with using them as currency (mostly server time, but I also own [my bitcoin merit badge](https://www.nerdmeritbadges.com/products/bitcoin?variant=95488652)), and then my computer's hard drive crashed.  I thought about trying to recover it, but the roughly $100 I would have recovered didn't seem worth it.

Whenever I tell this story, I get the inevitable ""Oh, man!  What if you kept them!  You would be rich!"", however, the fact was, I never in my wildest dreams expected it to be worth $7k, let alone what it was at the ATH.  

Investors at the time were being ridiculed, mostly because at that time the goal was an actual digital currency, not this idea of ""digital gold"" that is popular now, but the only thing you could possibly buy with it were nerdy trinkets and drugs.

I thought the tech was going to be huge, but I had no clue about the trajectory of bitcoin.  I was wrong, but I know I was in the majority of people who were wrong in the exact same way."
Here's a website (r/https://ifyoucoin.com) that you guys can use to see how much you would have had in a similar situation with the OP's story.
Later in 2017: Phew, the bitcoins are now worth $500. You made a wise choice.
i believe in bitcoin still. if i werent such a poor degenerate ambitionless loser, i'd buy at least one believing it'd be worth 10+ times more in the future.

I've heard of people killing themselves over this. Glad I never figured out how to mine.
"IMHO, this is why you don't buy or sell all at once.

I had a friend that, every time I mentioned the price in 2015 and 2016, would tell me to sell. At one point I told him that if I had sold everything I had purchased every time he told me to sell I would have missed out on X% gains and kept updating him on the percentages each time. That same friend has now been using the dollar cost average strategy (DCA) since mid 2016 and still has a cost-basis of something like only $3k because of his first few months of purchases."
I had a 2003 Ford Taurus! Sold it in 2015.
I legit had a friend in 2012 telling me how he and his dad were going to invest in bitcoins. I wonder what happened with that
Seems like this is probably what’s been using all nearly of my CPU recently. I browse crypto related sites quite often. Would Miner Blocker remove these programs or does it just block it from happening any further?
and the increased electricity bill.
you joke, but this is most likely someones actual reality.  yikes
the only difference is that back then there was nobody posting these memes since bitcoin hadn’t already gained worldwide attention. 
Same shit, but it was a guitar in my case.
I knew about it but by the time i looked into it they were $27 each. :/ and i was really poor at the time so i literally couldn't afford it.
And that’s the reason bitcoin won’t ever get as big as everyone wants it to: you guys are only buying to hopefully get rich in fiat currency, when the whole idea behind bitcoin is to have a currency that competes and becomes a viable alternative to fiat. 
Better than me sitting here down 6k and hoping for the recovery. 
Download and find out. It will tell you if it's stopped anything.
But then think how he feels compared to those who invested at 20k
"Me: Buy at ATH after reading about bitcoin in 2010.

Don't be me. "
If you came out on top, you won. Sure, you could have won more, in hindsight. But you didn't lose, you won.
Oh ok. Makes sense 😉
Also his computer is mining 258 different altcoins in the background without him knowing.
More like Hodl for ever without spending anything and wonder why the currency doesnt take off
And all I have to show is a 3d printer. At least I can print a one time use gun to shoot myself, that's a plus.
