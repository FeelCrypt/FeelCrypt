That’s Steam’s doing. Not Bitcoin’s. Do they accept gold?

Gold is valuable because it’s rare and durable. 
If you are saying that because the 1070 came out after the gpu days passed by then that makes sense but I used to mine with a cpu, and it wasnt terrible.
Gold can be seized easily. It cannot be sent to anywhere over the internet. 
Don't use minergate. They take about %25 of your hashrate for themselves. Switching from miner gate to nicehash gave me a %20 increase. 
"It is a shit currency today, yes.  
It's more of a store of value.  
However very bright engineers are working on infrastructure to support it as a currency.  
It's worked on."
Just leave em. So many people who invested late have to be staunch supporters, otherwise they are stupid investors. They will learn their lesson. I play online poker with bitcoin and I only get $38 from my $50 deposit. Coinbase takes a fee then there are transfer fees after it goes from wallet to site. I get around the coinbase fee through gdax transfer, but the end result is the same. Huge fees. The fees will never allow bitcoin to be a long term, relevant currency.
Weren’t Nicehash just hacked a few days ago and millions of BtC lost?
">Peso Pavilion 

Lmao "
What's stopping me is ignorance. Any way to ELI5 how to do this? Just purchased a new machine a short time ago. 
Lol how do you think bitcoin works? Just a bunch of numbers we sell to each other? I’d kindly ask you to read up on Blockchain. Maybe you’d even buy some after. 
I'd rather have my health than a fancy car that works just as well (for the driving I do which is none) as a reliable good value car
Like gold, diamonds, silver, gems... fiat, except truly finite and secured through cryptography. 
"Nicehash is a one stop shop for mining that will pick the most profitable algorithm for your computer and pay you in bitcoin. My 970 gets me about 1.50/day. I use “one click miner” to mine vertcoin (mainly because I love vertcoin, but they just halved the block reward so it may not be that worthwhile anymore), or you could try minergate, which will probably have you mining monero. If you’re looking for a little more DIY, you could check out ccminer or cgminer, which will allow you to choose which coin you mine. They require a bit more input on your part, but the process is easily explained by google. 

Realistically though nowadays I haven’t found a coin that’s “profitable” to mine. Machines specifically designed for mining have completely taken over big game coins like bitcoin. I’ve been aiming more towards any miner that’ll give me a relatively large volume of coin in the hopes that it’ll be worth more money in the future. If that’s your aim, I’ve been using minergate to mine BCN with my cpu (I still use my gpu to mine vertcoin as mentioned above) and I’ve gotten about 400 coins. At the moment those 400 are only worth like a dollar but I’ve got my fingers crossed. "
Get a vertcoin wallet and the one-click miner. It takes several clicks to set up (and there are YouTube tutorials available), but after the initial setup is done, you can get it start and stop it whenever you want with a single click.
That's the point though. They dropped it because it was too annoying of a currency. Can I walk into MC'ds with some gold and buy a big mac? No? Well, it's a shit currency then. 
"of course he has not bought any.....you can tell by his comment. it's what some people like /u/mrflagg have to say in order to help themselves sleep at night. Rather than admit they were wrong, they would rather feel like shit forever and cry and yell bubble. (which it is imo, but if you know anything about bitcoin and believe it will succeed, you would know that the overall price trend is always UP long term). the funny part is that these are the people that will be buying bitcoin at astronomical prices, 50k+. because by then it will be considered ""safe"" etc. by mainstream media."
Nah, that's Jerry, the racecar driver! 
I keep having to tell myself this about Bitcoin, too. I bought in between $11 and $35 and sold percentages of my holdings at $250, $1200, $800, $1000. I made a killing. But it's so tough to shake the fact that if I had just held, I'd have well over half a million dollars.
I feel sorry for the guy who spent 10,000 Bitcoins on pizza back in 2010. 
I think the Danish currency is kroner = k
Hey, you made over 200% profit.
I think he means 17,000k figures.
ENHANCE
flawed logic
Except it has already been an incredible investment for a number of people... 
It's currency you aren't buying stock you are buying gold or beads or goats just the new currency for a world market instead of a fiat tied to a piece of land for no reason. The only crash would be if you wanted to trade your bitcoin for another currency at the end of the day it can be traded independently 
Congratulations!  You've broke the world economy.
I'm not sure what that means. I recouped my initial investment by selling crypto currency for USD. I took some profit by selling cryptocurrency for USD. I still have some cryptocurrency in the market hoping for further gains. Where is the fallacy?  
Kanske. :b

Don't matter. Got pizza.
"Some redditors gifted me a total of $30 worth of bitcoin in late 2014, which I ended up just using to gift my friend a few Steam games.

I'm sure I wouldn't have held onto them for this long anyways, but man that would have grown nicely.

Edit: Fixed a typo in the year"
Bitcoin takes the bitcoin from bitcoin, and shoots on bitcoin, near miss but hits the bitcoin, bitcoins recovers the bitcoin and passes it to bitcoin, gets checked by bitcoin oh and a fight has broken out between bitcoin and bitcoin. Bitcoin takes a hook from bitcoin, a jab, but bitcoin recovers and delivers hooks back to bitcoin, knocking bitcoin out, both bitcoins get sent to the bitcoin box for a bitcoin. We'll be right back, more to come after this short bitcoin. 
Storing value safe from governments is not nothing. 
"That doesn’t matter, publicly traded stocks are almost entirely based off speculation just like Bitcoin. It’s only worth something because other people think it’s worth something.

Most stocks don’t pay dividend, don’t grant voting rights, and are not going to liquidate. Even if it does, you can bet your ass the regular joe stockholder ain’t going to see a dime of that liquidation.

This means realistically a stock does nothing for the stockholder, and the only way people are going to cash out on stocks is to sell it to another person."
What does gold do?
Or the more likely scenario -- the generic story of losing your password or whatever it is
Request Network is also still way undervalued and of course Substratum that could be the tech to help with the net neutrality bullshit going on. 
:/

"First scenario. Let's say you invest $100 into bitcoin. Your investment rises 2x. You take $100 out and leave $100 as BTC. Now bitcoin still rises 5x. You sell all BTC for $500. You now have $600.

Second scenario. Invest the same amount, $100. Bitcoin rises 2x. You hold. Bitcoin rises 5x. You sell for $1,000. You now have $1,000.

In the first strategy you minimize the risk of losing $100 but at the same time you are making possible future profits smaller.

If you can't afford to lose the initial $100, you shouldn't invest at all. "
Agreed, but there are not many things you need a billion dollars to buy.
Not true.

"You would have seen the run up to $1200, then either lost all your coins in the GOX theft, OR sold in disillusionment when it fell back to $200... 200% profits ain’t bad, you’d tell yourself.

Then you’d be posting about “I wish I had held on”

So don’t just wish you had gotten in at x price, also wish for the foresight to have held on through all the crashes."
Most people are just “talking” though, they don’t follow through
I wish I knew about Bitcoin in 2011 so I could buy it for $1 and sell it for $5 and then regret it for the rest of my life. 
The only way you made it this far with it is cause you forgot you had them 
Big if true
You simply don’t understand the underlying tech and how it’s evolving. If you think this is the peak you are vastly uninformed. You are going to see crypto decimate entire sectors. Banking? Gone. Insurance? Gone. ISPs? Gone. Online advertising? Gone. It’s going to power the IOT and enable the transition from a centralized infrastructure to a decentralized infrastructure. It’s going to be the biggest change to humanity since agriculture or contract law.
I'm sure he'll only give him 1/4th the love, by design.
It's gonna be something to behold, all right.

Yeah....No....
I did. I also bought more though
Their are still many things you cannot buy with bitcoin.
about 6,034
It would take quite a while to convert it all out to a fiat currency... but why would you?

"The difference is that stockholders can pay attention to the company's actions and decide if they want to stay in or pull out.

For bitcoin, it's looking at whetheror not other people are staying in or pulling out; it's an economic bubble within a ponzi scheme."
"a shovel does things too. It can dig holes, heave dirt, make a surface leveled.  Yet if there is no one to actually use it, it's worthless on its own.  

Being able to do things is not enough to create value. it's not enough to say that bitcoin has countless applications, if they're not available. What you're describing is a solution looking for a problem."

"I own a company that mines and exports precious metals, including gold.

Gold is used in electronics, medical devices, dentistry, space technology, and of course jewelry. 

It also has thousand upon thousands of years of historical demand behind it which gives investors price confidence. "
"Gold is a precious mineral. It has scarcity and actually has value outside of the stock market. It's used in jewelry, dentistry, and tons of electronics.

In other words, gold has a floor. Bitcoin doesn't. This means while it can infinitly go up, it can also infinitly go down."
Gold has a minimum value, it has utility, it has been used as a regulation for currency for at least a thousand years.  Bitcoin is literally just stocks with nothing backing it, if lots of people just decide to pull out one day, it's a goner. With gold you can't really *just* pull out...  
Nej, skruva dig
"So here's the deal; I became convinced in early November that bitcoin was a good bet: I had some spare cash because I had just sold a house, I invested and basically doubled my money. I'm currently playing with other peoples money, or since this is crypto, manufactured money. Have I behaved responsibly?"
That dude is exactly what I imagined a Bitcoin billionaire would look like.
Yeah. I remember the guy who rummaged through a landfill to find his old hard drive, lol.
"I'm all about them Dogecoins.

EDIT: HOLY SHIT. I was joking, but I just looked and apparently the Dogecoins I mined over Christmas Break 4 years ago are worth over $50. I hadn't checked their value in years. I think it was like $3 last time I looked."

I don't think you have any idea how currency works.
You know how a pyramid scheme works right? In order for Bitcoin to be a pyramid scheme there has to be a concentrated power at top who control everything. So who is it? What's the power at top? Calling it a pyramid scheme is autistic, calling it a risky investment is valid

For sure, effective altruism and GiveWell do solid work -- but it's important to remember the role of social movements, and other things that can't be immediately quantified in a spreadsheet too, in creating long-term systemic social change.

"One of the most little known impending crisis in this country is the Teacher Shortage. 

1.  Go ahead and google ""[insert state name] teacher crisis"". It's getting worse and worse. Statistics show that, going forward, for every 3 teachers retiring there will be 1 new teacher to replace them out of college.  

2. Teachers Deserve More Foundation is a cause designed to solve the Teacher Shortage Crisis with strategies built around all of the reasons students don't want to pursue teaching and reasons Teachers are leaving the profession.

Nelson Mandela said once: ""Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world"". 
My parents weren't rich or got an academic background, so they couldn't offer me the best education - I had to do it on my own. Nevertheless I was intelligent enought to know where to go and what to do to find my way through the german school system. 
Today I'm 34 and I knew that I could have made it better with my skillset - I could have get better degrees and though a chance to go to a university, but there was no one who supported me.

I wish there were more associations, foundations and institutions like serlo.org who supports people to get a better education!

The man who established serlo early recognized that he got a ""pole-position"" in life cause of his well situated and supportive family. He wants to share it with those who haven't got that luck... The existance of Serlo depends on donations so I hope you can support them with 1Million or whatever you think is reasonable.

Thank you for your help!!!

All the best,

+1 on contacting givewell directly. They have a history of making recommendations for major donors, and are associated with researchers going over a lot of different cause areas to find outstanding charities. No matter where you want to donate the rest of your money, I'm sure they would have some valuable input!
"Diarrheal diseases kill about 500,000 children under age 5 every year in the developing world, but many causes are among the cheapest ailments to effectively treat. The [Deworm the World Initiative](https://www.evidenceaction.org/#deworm-the-world) provides ~50c treatments to millions of children in the developing world and Givewell estimates they could effectively use $18.9 million more than they expect to take in over the next year.

RCTs suggest Deworm the World's interventions rank among the most cost effective at saving and extending human lives. Please contact their parent organization, [Evidence Action](https://donate.evidenceaction.org/campaign/general-fundraising-page/c139764), I'm sure they'll have a Bitcoin address for you!"
"(Sidenote: I am just dreaming aloud here, I am not trying to imply I am looking for funding.)

If only I had that kind of capital. I'd love to create two non-profit organizations, one of which would fund research into bitcoin security and development separate from any corporate interest all together.

The second would be the same thing but for general opensource development with grants paid out on a yearly basis based on applications from opensource projects.

Of course, in this imaginary world the grants would pay out in bitcoin. :)"
"All of the organizations suggested below are part of a long-term project, [Helperbit](https://app.helperbit.com), that is bringing transparency in charity sector using blockchain technology. You could be a great ambassador of this vision: if one day in the entire charity world it will be possible to track the path of the money till the final beneficiary there will be definitely more trust in NGOs' work, so more donations will come and there will be less mismanagement of the funds.

"I’m an me sufferer, i have been dismissed and neglected by modern medicine. I have just had to write a letter to my gp because she recommended a harmful exercise as treatment. This is a very serious illness with a biological cause. It’s not tired all the time, The key symptom is an intolerance to exertion, even the slightest activity can cause horrendous payback/sickness for Upto a week. execise can cause permanent relapses and even death in very rare and extreme cases. Suicide is 5 times more likely too. It’s like living in a prison with no walls, many patients are isolated are abandoned. Poor psychological research and changing the name to chronic fatigue syndrome has muddied the waters and made a total mess. Fraudulent studies have stolen the treatment narrative and resulted in harmful exercise based treatments be adopted by NICE and CDC. Thankfully these treatments have been shown to be ineffective and harmful and are being dropped. Research is massively underfunded for such a common disease and is way behind other equivalent diseases. The disease has no specialty home, there are a handful of doctors in the world, patients are left to fend for themselves as Gps don’t know how to treat it. 

OMF are super innovative and collaborative and are focused on research rather than publications. Whitney Dafoe, Ron Davis’s son is so ill he cannot speak and is tube fed. They are best chance. Please donate. "
"Givewell generally comments on the funding gap for each charity, so they should be able to find that out.

Haha I'm sure there's a government in place to keep the safety mechanism in check.
