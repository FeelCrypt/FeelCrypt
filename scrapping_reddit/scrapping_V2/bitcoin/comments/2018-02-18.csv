"""it's like bitcoin is some kinda non-giving up kinda phenomenon"""
It doesn't matter what the fees are now. It matters what the fees are when there's a huge volume and the number of transactions increases exponentially, which is what would happen with real adoption.
Probably too much, but feel free to correct me.
Difficulty to mine increases exponentially if someone jumps into network with huge machines. Bitcoin hashrate to mine changes every 16 days.
Idk, I haven't done much research into the area and was proposing some thoughts so someone who has done more research might be able to tell me if I was wrong.
Those fees don't go to bankers they go to miners.
i love complaining about .0004$ fees
"A person can buy BTC today, xfer it anywhere in the world permissionlessly, near instantaneouly and for mere cents, and if the buyer was worried about volatility sell it immediately.

This beats the current global remittance market in every way."
Bitcoin is not the only cryptocurrency. And use cases don't limit to transactions only. Cryptocurrencies are decentalised cryptographically secured protocols. And that's where it gains it's value. You can build apps on top of it. Like etherum and neo, you can store data on blockchains and monetize that data buy tieing up ownership. Solutions regarding volatility are in development. New crypto projects are trying to tie all cryptocurrencies. Request Network is trying to build a system where merchant can request payment in multiple different currencies. But you can pay with any currencies. It will get converted on on the network as per market rate. Both will receive invoice of transactions. You can create temper proof voting process on blockchain. United nations is partnered with HST Decision token for voting on blockchain. You can tie genetic data of participants of research on blockchain and they will receive lifetime of payment whenever someone uses their data. You can build temper proof smart electricity grids .
Do you... Not understand how money supply works? And to compare any crypto to a fiat currency is absolutely ridiculous. Like I said (and the IRS agrees), it's a digital asset. There is no underlying value, only speculative value. If nobody wanted to buy Bitcoin tomorrow, the price would drop to $0. If nobody wanted to buy dollar pairs in the forex market, you'd still be able to order your McDonalds dollar menu dinner.
"The technology behind it has usefulness, but people mistake that for Bitcoin itself having value. Blockchain technology is the future, but it won't be through Bitcoin. It did a lot for advancing the tech, but it suffers from ""first is the worst"" syndrome. "
"Except for global, permissionless, decentralized, semi-anonymous, near instantaneous and cheap wealth transfer.

Yeah, no usefulness in that. /s"
The difference is a Bitcoin IOU is not any more useful than a Bitcoin, but a gold IOU is a lot more useful than a gold bar in many ways. 
"You don't need to have fractional reserve banking in order to have lending.  

Sure, it frees up massive amounts of capital, but it's not strictly required.

Besides, in my (admittedly uneducated) opinion, our society could do with less buying on credit/loans. "
"Eh, just the part of the economy that flourishes with cheap money.

Once businesses had to have actual ROI instead of dreams, we would see the world re-order around the new funding sources.
"
They handed out IOUs, sure, they could do that with Bitcoin, but Bitcoin is much easier to demand ACTUAL Bitcoin from than gold.
right and it can't handle more than 4 transactions per second, compared to visa handling 2000/s on your average tuesday
I'm sorry an error occurred. Paging /u/valentulus_menskr
"> fixed supply

A core issue of any cryptocurrency that will hamper mass adoption, that I rarely see discussed.

The amount of monetary value is steadily increasing over time. If you can't make more of your currency, you will run into the issue that your smallest denomination will be worth more than the least valuable product one might reasonably buy.

There are 2100000000000000 units in most cryptocurrencies. If the total value of any such currency exceeds 21 trillion, 1 unit is > 1 cent. Current money supply in fiat is about 110 trillion dollars (1 unit ~= 5 cents).

The problem will be even worse in reality, because cryptocurrency tokens can be destroyed and lost forever, further diminishing supply and increasing deflation.

At some point, you won't be able to buy a pound of rice without overpaying.

And that's not even touching how useful ad-hoc creation of money is for a capitalist economy."
Fixed supply without stable demand means nothing. Rarity does not make anything intrinsically valuable.
So you have a method of finding rational investors, but how does that reflect on Bitcoin?
As long as they figure out the tax shit accordingly I would love to be paid in Bitcoin. I know plenty of others like me. 
It's actually kinda sick how a lot of stuff you're gonna read can be  absolute bs on these subs because people wanna rep for crypto so that they can make money

Bitcoin is not a pyramid scheme in the traditional sense, but that is a terrible argument. You think the billions of dollars invested into Bernie Madoff's scheme were all coming from private investors? There's people making decisions in VC's, they can be tricked or make bad choices just like everyone else. 
Of course, but people also trade real currencies too. International finance is pretty complex like that. And bitcoin is not very different than say stocks in some regards, the gains of some are often funded by the losses of others. The only real danger is that being unregulated, it can be manipulated, but from what I know, that mostly applies to thinner crypto currencies. 
"> Yeah but Bitcoin is supposed to be a currency.

Nice save. Now nobody will suspect you're a time traveller.... 
If quantum computing had ANY negative effect on Bitcoin, why wouldn’t it be able to have an equal-and-opposite (or MORE significant) impact on Bitcoin in its favor?
"Two responses to that:

1) Quantum computing will affect much more than BTC

2) BTC can be (hard, IIRC) forked to make it even quantum attack safe."
"I think once quantum computers come out and have enough qubits to really make a decent attack - 

that's when we'll all sit around, do nothing, and watch our investment in this completely crash,

While every other cryptographically protected system in the world is left alone.

Hahah, yeah, right.

We might be the only group properly motivated to do something, and a question mark as to whether or not we are the best target for attack (maybe we are?)"
We are soo far away from decent quantum computers.
You should look up quantum resistant cryptography. Bitcoin is just code and will continue to be upgraded.

FDIC insured means your cash is insured. If they lose the crypto, you get the crypto back at the dollar amount it was stolen at, which can blow if it’s worth way more. 
"Keeping money on an exchange is like keeping money in your bank account.

If keeping money in a bank account was also considered unsafe then everyone would keep their money under their mattress at home.

You’re not making exchanges sound good here. Still sounds like unsafe and unregulated bank except most people have learnt not to trust them. Great system."
"I think a lot of the ""pump"" happens through Reddit..."
"Fiat currency is physical Monopoly money backed by threat of war (economic or otherwise).

The idea of programmable money, aka money that does more than denote its own value, is almost an absolute certainty in the near future. It is too valuable and tenacious an idea to be just considered merely hype. Nobody knows if Bitcoin will continue to be the standard bearer for that idea in the future, but it is the most influential one that exists today.

While rampant speculation does obscure the true value, it also produces the perfect conditions for significant and lasting innovation to occur.

We live in a world where all we’ve ever known is fiat currency. Dismissing better alternatives is simply a failure of imagination."

Better than the value changing by double digit percentage over the course of days. And also having a currency which you can earn via purchasing and running a graphics card farm? Yeah, that’s definitely the currency of the future...
I love how everybody says we have 2% inflation when the money supply doubles every 8 years. 
Bitcoin is no currency. It would need to have smaller transaction fees, use less electricity, supported by many retailers, and be inflationary, and be uniquely useful (like to pay taxes).... all things it doesn't have.
"Market share needs to increase a lot, users need to become more diverse, but in the end it always will be volatile, because it is an open currency. 

Consider two things:

1. There are more volatile Fiat currencies around (Venezuela, Zimbabwe) etc. Most ppl compare to the USD or Euro which are exceptionally stable.

2. Fiat cannot be withdrawn all at once, because technically, you don't own your money. The BTC on your wallet can. Nobody is stopping huge money movements with AML, ATF, business days or bank holidays."
"Well first a lightning network needs to be implemented in order to prevent another fiasco where fees shoot through the roof and a simple transaction takes all day to process. Once we've solved the fee and transaction time issue, the next step is for major retailers to start accepting it. 

Finally — although optionally — an ASIC resistant coin needs to overtake Bitcoin in order to put the power back into the peoples' hands. The whole point of Bitcoin was to have a decentralized currency that the big banks and wealthy elite can't control, but mining BTC has become so difficult now, that the only ones who *can* afford dedicated ASIC mining hardware so happen to be those very same people. 

In the good old days anyone with a graphics card could mine Bitcoin. So now you have these so-called ""ASIC resistant"" coins popping up left and right (like Vertcoin) that can still be GPU mined, trying to become what Bitcoin was originally supposed to be. Honestly I hope one of them *does* eventually surpass Bitcoin, but at this point I'll be happy just to see just about *any* crypto get mainstream acceptance. "
"I would have to be HUGELY higher priced.

It will never be ""stable"" though. It's not like fiat where they control the stability.

Bitcoin will - for the forseeable future - rock back and forth between FOMO high prices, and dodge the falling knife low prices.

In the meantime, if you can relax while this happens, you should do nicely, but you have to have a 3+ year time horizon.
"
"Satoshi, while brilliant technically, was unfortunately not an expert in economics. 

Bitcoin, being a finite (and shrinking) supply, is deflationary by nature, and a deflationary asset can never be used as currency. 

People are right when they say Bitcoin is buoyed by hype, that it's basically digital monopoly money. It will continue to be volatile until people see through the hype, which I think won't be for a long time because Bitcoin is hard to understand by many. But after that, it will tank to nearly nothing.

Right now, whales and smaller cunning traders know the scheme of pump-and-dump for which bitcoin is extremely useful. They will hype (pump) and get the gullible to buy, and then sell after it goes up for a while (dump), and repeat this process. They'll take a lot of people's money. 

I believe the losers (money-wise) in the end will be 1. those who mistime the market (buy high, sell low), and 2. those who hodl for too long (until bubble finally bursts and bitcoin becomes worthless). All of those people's money will go to those who really understand what Bitcoin is and how to take advantage of it. 



"
It is used as a currency, but it's valued in dollars, like gold. Bitcoin is digital gold. 
I don't think it will ever stabilize in the standard sense of a currency, because it is different from currency in that no more can ever be printed(well very unlikely, code changes plus agreement of basically everyone invested) it was designed to be anti inflationary, so it just doesn't behave like normal money, tether on the other hand, that is a lot like the dollar....because it is pegged to the USD on a 1:1 ratio

"Like right now.  2 satoshi/byte tx's are confirming on the next block.  That represents about 4 cents for a standard transaction.

If one compares it to the minimum fees that credit cards charge (10 cents, and 3% of the purchase), it's been under that amount for several weeks now....."
How much do you think it costs to send $15 right now? 
But bitcoin transaction fees are higher than bank transaction fees. What’s stopping banks from collecting all the money by building huge mining machines?
Bitcoin challenges the very concept of 'value'.  I don't have any idea what bitcoin is going to become, and i know a lot about it.  It isn't like any other financial instrument ever created.  Any person who tries to apply their labels to it shows only their reliance upon labels instead of validating their assumptions.  What happens if it doesn't stop?  Not over 5 years, but 25?

You must ask yourself - when has any lending institutions cared what you maxed your credit card on? Now all of a sudden they are protecting you - no that is what is called self preservation on the banks. Blockchains offer clear transparency on transaction - meaning no one can manipulate the numbers - what does that mean for a banker? Oh shit - that is what that means.

And if they say ""well the technology"", that's like reading Playboy for the articles.

Some things with bitcoin become possible (like buying houses, buying corporations, buying and selling Ukraine's annual wheat production, etc etc, the bigger bitcoin gets in price and value.) So unlike the supporters that ONLY think the tech matters, the price matters too.

"First off, when you buy stocks as a retail investor you aren’t financing shit. That only applies if you buy stock directly from the company in an offering, which is generally only available to vc firms and angel investors.

Secondly, sound, programmable, uncensorable money has incredible value to a society, as it enables trade that was not possible before. "
"Well duh, of course it differs from stock in that sense. I talking about the idea of demand being driven by speculation and real value being manipulated through limited supply and increased demand. This is elementary economics.  And you buying a stock on the secondary market is not financing shit, it’s only purchased because somebody sees a stock as undervalued and they think they can make some money when the price rises again. 

And bitcoin does add value to society, have you ever had to remit your income oversees? Or send money through western union? That’s just one example"

"> the only reason someone needs to use a bank like exchange is to convert usd with crypto

Uh are you forgetting about buying crypto? Without exchanges people are limited to: trading with cash or items in person, mining, or using ATMs (which are also connected to centralized exchanges). Face it, bitcoin isn't some utopian revolution. It requires the same shit as existing currencies, just in slightly different forms."
"It’s not the USD that is being lost in exchange hacks.

It’s not USD that bitfinex/tether are likely using to prop up the markets.

It’s not the banks that are taking the exchanges offline during crashes that prevent you from selling when you want to.

This is just the stuff we know about. I’m sure there is so much manipulation by the whales running the exchanges.

Hell one of the biggest & dodgiest exchanges (bitfinex) doesn’t even do USD deposits and withdraws does it?

And so far we’re just covering the dodgy side of exchanges compared to banks. Don’t get me started on what banks and fiat provide the economy that exchanges and crypto don’t and never will."
No that’s like keeping your money in your physical wallet or your personal safe.
"How safe an exchange is doesn’t define whether it’s a bank or not.

Many banks provide brokerage services too, but they also allow you to exchange your money to other currencies. They’re also the main way to send money to and from other people. They also provide lending services and all sorts of other things.

Though even if you took the view that exchanges are like brokerages my original point still stands that an exchange is just the crypto equivalent of a financial institution unless you don’t consider Goldman Sachs etc as financial institutions?"
"Everything you said is based on the state that it is in today with no regards to the fact that it is a developing technology. Bitcoin today is not the same it was a few years ago and development is only accelerating, as it does with all technology.

It’s like saying in the 90s that the internet won’t ever be useful to a large population because only nerds know how it works. The internet also developed exponentially from that and so will Bitcoin. "

That makes sense, I was just stating the wallet to wallet fees.
Exchanges take more fees. As operating cost. Wallet to wallet is whole different thing.
Not sure about exchanges but i had a next block confirmation a few days ago for under 5 bucks
In exchanges that rape you sure, but actual sending fees from wallet to wallet is not by any means.
"I don't accept those numbers.  Let's look at the data:

https://dedi.jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#2h

I see 2 sat/byte tx's are confirming (5 times in the last 2 hours) that's 4 cents for a typical 1 in, 2 out transaction.  So those are making it through, albeit slowly.

Everything 10 sat/byte and up is confirming on the very next block. That's less than 20 cents. 

For comparison: In the US, a typical credit card merchant fee is 10 cents, plus 3%.  So, for a $10 purchase, that's 40 cents....  I don't particularly like comparing to cc's though, because that is a centralized system that requires trust and permission to transact.

"
At currently speculation. If one need to invest in different crypto one need to look into all partnerships, development team , road map etc. Stellar have IBM partnership, iota has Bosch , etc. Major companies are building blockchains for their businesses so people are running behind those partnership currently. Half of this is speculation honestly.its is like dotcom bubble. Most start-ups will die.but some will become next google or Amazon
I think it'd be great if the world shifted to decentralized currency but you also need to be realistic. It's not really a savings account if there is a fear that you could lose a lot by simply holding on to your medium of exchange. It's also not a great medium of exchange if there aren't many vendors willing to sell their goods using the medium of exchange. I think blockchain and similar technologies have a lot of potential, but at least for the moment I don't particularly think currency is one of them.
Wrong again bucky, fiat currency doesn't derive its value from speculation. It's guaranteed by the government 
That is the truth.
Except that for a transfer of wealth stability is arguably the most important factor. Why would I send someone bitcoin if it might be 10% or more valuable day to day, and why would I accept it if it might be the opposite?

"Less than 1% is not the same as absolutely nothing.

https://www.statista.com/statistics/299609/gold-demand-by-industry-sector-share/

~15% of gold demand is for electronics and industry. Demand effects value. If its physical properties weren't desirable there would be less demand and therefore less value.
"
"I would say resistance to corrosion, mixed with weight/mass, malleability/ability to be made into stuff, shininess/appeal, relatively low melting point (but not too low), prevalence/difficulty to obtain (enough to have it move around, not enough to be super common, hard enough to get to have value in the labor alone).

Those are some good reasons (pre modern technology) that gold is valuable. "
">If you dont understand an investment, i say stay the hell away from it.

The value of bitcoin comes from the idea that it's usable as a currency, right? A stable store of value to function as a medium of exchange. It sucks at that. That means that it has no inherent underlying value.

The fact that you're treating it as an investment is bad. The asset's liquidity is provided by other people buying into it, hoping that other people will buy into it and make their asset more valuable. It's like investing into a tech company that doesn't make any products or do anything. It can't go on forever and as soon as people stop buying into it and start selling off, the entire thing collapses like a house of cards.

I'm not saying don't buy in. Bitcoin is an amazingly volatile speculative asset, and that makes it a good gamble in the short term. In the long term, it functions like that type of scheme.
"
It’s only a backronym if you say it like a word. If you say the letters it’s called a backritialism.

Correct. It was valuable long before any of those existed.
"The fantastic thing for me, is that it is actually money technology.  Its underlying value of it existing at all is the technology.  The only real question is what you can build on it.  The bigger it is, the more things it can build.  To not invest in it is madness.  But if ya don't understand it for you, i would never encourage you to invest in it.  Free world.

Nothing? *Nothing* to do with the value? The fact that it is used in computers, cellphones, and spacecraft has nothing to do with it's value?
Depends on the physical property you're talking about, right?  I mean, the fact that it's incredibly nonreactive/noncorrosive makes it a lot easier to just stash somewhere indefinitely.   You can get gold from centuries-old shipwrecks at the bottom of the sea and it's still fine.  That definitely helps with its usefulness as a currency or currency backer, or at the very least would have in the past.

Congratulations on being in a position where bitcoin has no use for you (aka living in a country with a relatively stable currency and also being in the top 10% wealthiest in the world).

People who aren't in that position, such as [in Venezuela](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/09/big-in-venezuela/534177/) have a use for it."
That's an absolutely good observation.  To a wealthy, well connected consumer with lots of options BTC isn't the best choice right now other than speculation.  I believe conversion is going to start with the weakest currencies and the most underbanked first.
"Not random, I select the amount.
I will agree there is volatility.  That's to be expected in something as early in development as BTC is.
Transaction fees are around two cents right now.  Better than any other form of transfer with the exception of cash."
"Nope.

Bills of Credit have been in use since before the US was a country. Fiat currency redeemable for nothing, backed only by the governments promise to accept them as payment for debts.

The earliest fiat dates back 1000 years."
It is a cryptocurrency backed by bitfinex, there have recently been some concerns around it regarding solvency, and they are currently undergoing an investigation by cftc I believe, but by and large the market has decided they are solvent. Tether was developed as a hedge against the volatility of Bitcoin, allowing the user to continue to hold crypto assets, without being exposed to high volatility. It kind of allows you to enter and exit crypto positions without actually cashing to Fiat. There may be other uses, but those are how I have viewed the product.

Current cost of having your transaction processed within 10 minutes is $3.26, and thats with daily transactions being lower than they have been in nearly 2 years. To get it within 6 blocks (1 hour) is $0.54. This is considerably more expensive and slower than VISA although it is cheaper and faster than Western Union.

you also have to factor in the fees and waiting times of selling bitcoin on an exchange, if an exchange will even do business with the 3rd world country you're in (which it probably doesn't). Then it don't look so good.

>This beats the current global remittance market in every way.

Why are Western Union making more money now than when Bitcoin was released then?

If new crypto currencies are continually created, how can one expect to retain value? What makes one more valuable than the other? Serious question.
"> If nobody wanted to buy dollar pairs in the forex market, you'd still be able to order your McDonalds dollar menu dinner.

No you wouldn't; if nobody wanted to buy dollars, it's because they're worthless. McDonalds isn't going to give you burgers in exchange for something that the market agrees is worthless.

I don't compare fiat currencies to cryptocurrencies, and obviously fiat currencies will be more stable because they are carefully controlled. The consequence of this is that they will always be *falling* in value as new money is created in an attempt to stabilize the economy. Bitcoin is effectively a hedge against this."
"What can I buy with Bitcoin?

I'm a mid 20s professional living in Canada working in the tech sector. I own my own home with a small mortgage, a car, and everything that entails living indepdently and comfortably in the west coast. Realistically, what value does Bitcoin have for me other than to be traded on speculation? You can throw around words like ""decentralized"" and ""permissionless"" all you want, but it boils down an ultimately contextless, meritless claim for someone in my position.

I make a pretty good living working regularly. And as far as I can tell, people get into crypto for two reasons: interest in blockchains and speculative trading. The former would not bother promoting it because it serves them no purpose, and the latter are just vultures looking to get rich by watching youtube videos or capturing trends where there are none. I know this because one of the only posts made by a ""quant"" after the crash in prices was met with head nodding and a couple of ""good write-up, really informative"" type posts. Go figure."

"Fractional-reserve banking isn't something you *need* so much as something that *happens when* you have lending.

When you are a banking system that lends people money, those people or their workers) deposit that money you just lent them right back in the bank accounts you hold for them. Fractional-reserve lending isn't something you have direct control over."
Hence it is not inflationary and much less useful as a currency, since it will tend not to circulate and be hoarded.
"Visa is centralized, requires permission, expensive and has limitations on who in the world can use it.

BTC is decentralized, permissionless, inexpensive and global.  Furthermore, I believe LN will increase the transaction capacity and 1st layer solutions will only be for very large transfers (things that require title, like car/boat/land or similarly sized purchases)

Comparing BTC to Visa is like comparing a bus and a motorcycle.  Sure, they both get you from point A to B, but the ride is very different."

But instead of tying it to USD .. would you be happy to be paid a fixed BTC figure for the next 12 months? For example .. from now on you will be paid 0.4 BTC per month.
Sure getting paid in Bitcoin is fine, but have you spent any of your Bitcoin on actual goods and not just other cryptos?
Bernie Madoff orchestrated a $65 billion dollar fraud. I'm pretty sure that phrase is getting me caught by the automoderator, but you know what type of fraud it is. A large market cap in no way assures the value of the underlying assets. With Bitcoin's disputable utility of a currency, both through the inability to efficiently process transactions and through volatility that renders it useless as a baseline store of value, there's decent evidence to suggest that it basically functions as a decentralized version of Madoff's fraud.

"Crypto hasn’t even come close to matching the economic inertia that gives fiat currency its stable value. 

The vast majority of crypto owners have no interest in using it as a day-to-day currency. A limited number of vendors do accept bitcoin in exchange for goods, but I have never seen a mainstream vendor who advertises prices in bitcoin. They advertise prices in fiat.

The idea that crypto solves a problem is always presented in vague terms. There is no demand for an alternative currency. Nobody really cares about using bitcoin. Nobody is buying bitcoin because it improves their ability to operate in the economy on their preferred terms. 

Crypto investors can go on and on about the benefits of crypto, but the fact is that nobody cares. And if nobody cares, then the imagined benefits are just a meaningless sales pitch."
"Exchange != Bank

It's possible regulated crypto banks could show up in the future, and I would be surprised if they didn't, but calling GDAX a bank would be like calling Ameritrade a bank. The safest place to keep crypto right now is either in a hardware or paper wallet in a safe deposit box, aka, in an actual bank."

"""It originated in a December 2013 post on the Bitcoin Forum message board by an apparently inebriated user who posted with a typo in the subject, 'I AM HODLING.'""

For context:  https://i.imgur.com/YsBAKlX.png

It just became one of those terms that stuck and was somehow uniquely ""bitcoin"" so people keep using it.  Since his declaration of I AM HODLING came on the heels of a $1200 drop to $400, it means to be strong and hang in there even when things look dire."
A drunk guy misspelled hold in a BTC forum and someone came up with the meaning hold on for dear life for hodl
"There was basically some old forum thread where a guy was telling everyone that ""I AM HODLING"". He unintentionally made that spelling mistake and somehow it became a meme to ""hodl"" bitcoin, since bitcoin always seemed to increase in value."
But why would people use Bitcoin in place of cash if it is incredibly volatile? People may buy it as a speculative investment, but that doesn't have any relation to its use as currency?

Actually it differs from stocks in the point that stocks actually finance something (company projects, etc) while bitcoin has no actual value to society / economy whatsoever.

OMG YOU KILLED BITCOIN! YOU BASTARDS
Centralized exchanges are not something you have to use with bitcoin, the only reason someone needs to use a bank like exchange is to convert usd with crypto. Crypto only exchanges can be and are decentralized and more secure. Like people cite problems with using services like coinbase as problems with btc, but it actually stems from the usd side of things.
"> Keeping money on an exchange is like keeping money in ~~your~~ someone else's bank account.
  
  
Keeping money in your own wallet is like keeping money in your bank account."
It stems from the original accidental misspelling.
">Continued growth shows continued adoption

You might want to look at how many of the top 500 US retailers are accepting bitcoin now compared to in 2014.

Increasing price does not mean increasing adoption when the price increase is coming from speculation, not adoption."

so like if someone bought bitcoin at 6k they could sell it now for 5x profit? how does that work? Why didn't everyone in the bitcoin community invest thousands if the return wouldve 500%?
When you totally forget about fiat currency and move the fiat currency out of the equation, then the value of bitcoin never changes. 1 bitcoin yesterday is the same 1 bitcoin today. Forget about BTC/USD exchange, then it becomes the real currency.

"""no fundamentals""

What do you think the fundamentals of a cryptocurrency, or any currency, should be? Is the ability to hold it and transact with it worth nothing?"
Yes, it has no underlying usefulness.
What's with the 11.6 line you drew in the sand
Can’t do that with stock either yet financial institutions have embraced stocks. 
Yeah they can. They used to do that with gold bars. Remember bank accounts are not money, they are just debt obligations. Debt measured in bitcoin can be traded as future bitcoins and could cause inflation... until the inevitable bank run which becomes more of a problem, like it was under gold.
Why can't they?
But lending is the backbone of society, if we didn’t have fractional reserve banking the economy would grind to a halt. 
Fractional reserve originally got started on the gold standard. If you don't actually hold the bitcoin, but instead have them deposited in an account someplace, then those folks can certain play the same old games.  
ooooooooooor, because no one wants to spend money or loan money at all because that five dollar hoagie is a hundred dollars a week from now, it's functionally useless as a currency. Both hyperinflation and hyperdeflation are bad.

Buy more now, it's back down again.
Welcome to crypto investing... [buy  high, sell low](https://blockogy.com/hangout/people-btc-right-now/)
You may want stability but its not always everyone's first priority.
It has been roughly growing at 0.48% a day for the past 6 months with some huge bubbling and such.  It absolutely works.  If you are not in a hurry, transitions are like 9 cents and you'll get it overnight.  If you want it fast as in like 10 minutes, the price is like 70 cents.  That is all going way way down with greater segwit adoption and the start of lightening.  
If your money is in a bank, you don't own the money, you actually own a debt of that amount from the bank, the debt is exactly as valuable as the bank's willingness and ability to repay it. If you own bitcoin then you can spend it any time you want and can stop you. Think of owning bitcoin like burying a block of gold in your back yard but more secure and convenient (but but to be fair, you can't spend it without Internet access).
 No one uses it as a currency.

When a post hits r/all the salties that called Bitcoin stupid in 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017 come in to call Bitcoin stupid again.
I think its because they can't make money off of exchanges of bitcoin: banks are used to collecting so much money just from being able to use others' money, and something like bitcoin threatens that dynamic.
I always wonder if comments like this are serious or trolling? Like, do you not understand why storing value elsewhere is a threat to financial institutions and FiAT regardless of volatility? Continued growth shows continued adoption which would a possible future of high stability? I’m just confused by comments like these and the follow up comments of “yeah someone gets it!” 
Well if you're up 5000% a 90% drop doesnt look that bad anymore. Its better than 2% inflation

How embarrassing for him. "
It’s because a lot of Bitcoin (or crypto in general) supporters think blockchain is a disruptive technology that can replace the current financial system (i.e. “the jewish mafia bankers are evil, Bitcoin fights the evil!”) ... when it’s only a foundational technology that has the potential to improve the current financial system. 
Because they can't loan it out in greater supply than they actually have and run a fractional reserve with it.
"I personally don't have much expectations with it either.   
I just wanna trade and make sweet little profit.   
Happy with whatever I get."
Just you wait! Any day now the sheeple will wake up and start converting all of their normie money into BTC. It's just as good except you can't spend it anywhere and you get to go to bed each night not knowing how much it will be worth when you wake up.
That is why some of the largest companies that previously accepted btc as a form of payment no longer do. The relatively consistent trend btc had is gone and it isn't worth them risking taking it as a payment. Dell, Microsoft, steam, stripe.
It's volatile because it's so young, thinly traded, hardly used (anchored to real purchases) and hardly anyone owns any of it. I'm not going to argue that bitcoin is going to succeed, but volatility would go away with adoption. It's a chicken and the egg scenario. No one will use bitcoin because it's volatile. But volatility would go away if people used it.
It's not even a currency, by any definition of it. Not that it will stop someone who misunderstands 'store of value' to jump on my comment.
Financial institutions are going to get scared once sending $15 doesn't cost $15 lol.

Because it takes away power from them. Cryptocurrencies are not just currencies they are secure decentralised protocols. And you can build tons of application on it. Decentalised databases and ownership on blockchain will compete against traditional financial institutions and companies.
"Gib it time my friend.

Gib it time......"
Total noob here, what would need to happen for the value of bitcoin to stabilize a bit? I mean, its intended goal was to be used as currency, so I imagine that's the goal, right?
No. USD can be used as a currency. But banks and the government tell you how you can spend it, who you can send it to, how much you can have before you are required to give them specific information, etc. Bitcoin mostly solves these issues
Better to have steady and secure 2%  inflation amirite?
If bitcoin becomes much more adopted as a currency, and people speculate less, the price would stabilise like with any regular currency.
Not to mention the massive amount of pump and dumping to inflate the value of bitcoin and the numerous hacks that have occurred against Bitcoin exchanges over the last year and change.
