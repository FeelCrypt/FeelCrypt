Or he could be lying on the internet.
In hindsight I could have taken out my 401k , penalties and all, and invested in the beginning of the year and become a millionaire. I'd like to see an AMA about someone who did something similar just to try and understand their rationale. Maybe they know something I don't.
Um.. are you sure? Like when it was 8 cents versus $18,000 now?

"Who's to say?  Think about these supply demand factors...

Over 70% of the bitcoin has already been mined.

A decent portion of that has been lost forever.

Everyday only 800 new bitcoin come into existence and that will be cut in half in a few years.

The final < 30% of the bitcoin supply will be mined over the next 120 years!

How many more bitcoin are yet to be lost forever?

Less than 1/10 of 1% of the world population is in.  The big players aren't in yet except for a tiny minority.  

If the demand doubles what happens to the price?  Depends on how bad those people want it and how reluctant the holders are to selling.

What can demand realistically do over the next 20 years?

If BTC is still going strong in 20 years I think it will be exponentially more than it is.

What can kill or severely harm it?  

Another MUCH better crypto, BTC has first mover advantage.


A cataclysmic event affecting the entire world.

A site like amazon telling customers it not only accepts bitcoin but is offering a 25% discount to those that use it to make their purchase?"

Nothing like a life changing panic attack when you're high. I've had a couple of those that helped me reverse some destructive habits.
“That’s what she said” was a very fitting final line for him to end the show on.

Except the exact opposite is more true. Just looking at the amount of examples for comedians who have shined in dramatic roles, compared to the low to non-existent amount of dramatic actors succeeding in comedy.
My names not drama 
I...please don't do that. The future of crypto currency is still relatively uncertain, and the regulations and legislation forthcoming. I'm not saying don't invest, but it is always wisest to diversify your investments and savings.
"Sure, well I know you're kidding but you can join a mining pool, mine something else, and some of those pools sell that to buy bitcoin. 

I think I got like .03 bitcoin or something back in the day doing that with my GPU cards - lol :)"
mfw I already cashed out the initial investment and I'm still gaining faster than I earn money from my job.
That’s what I was thinking too. People are just investing for the sake of investing and not using it for its intended purpose. But what about gold? People invest in gold just go invest in it. They don’t use it for any other purpose. Yet the value has continued to rise. 
Gonna take a year imo, before we see people understanding that it's not the best crypto.
was one of them getting high and having panic attacks?
Lol, like?
How on earth can someone steal bitcoins from this guy using his Reddit? I genuinely don't know.
The idea that everyone is investing in bitcoin just to invest in it, not because it's being used more and more (its literally growing consumer side SLOW) is crazy to me. It's people investing just because it's going up and then pretending it's because of the tech. 
I'm sure you helped someone who stumbled in here. 
Hey thanks, I've been on the edge of any real understanding of bitcoin, I just knew my GPU was worth a lot more cause it could mine it faster. I'm gonna go dump my entire savings into them now thank you so much :)
"> I would've thrown EVERYTHING on BTC of I had known it would blow up like this.

But you didn't. And you would have sold when it doubled. If you could tell the future you could have just bought the winning lottery tickets. "
"> But trading crypto-currencies isn't like stocks - we don't have to compete with the wall street bots *yet*. 

What? High frequency trading firms like Jane Street have been playing with Bitcoin since 2014, and commercial/OS trading bots with plugins for exchanges have been available since 2013."
Because it’s fun watching the price go up and down and all around.
don't listen to this troll.  Bitcoin 100k then 1 million.
I'm putting half. I make minimum wage, so even if bitcoin collapses and I lose everything, it won't ruin me because it wasn't a whole lot of money to begin with...
"everyone keeps saying that. but ive been disagreeing since 2013.
but ill admit that it is a lot more stress than most people would ask for.


Edit : I still upvoted you"
Well, it will not blow up nearly 100x like it did in the last few years, BUT, will you say the same thing again when it blows up another 10x in the next few years?
For the love of god this. Cryptocurrencies are great to diversify a portfolio because they generally have VERY LOW/non-existant correlation to other markets. But don't put all your eggs in one (extremely volatile) basket.
"> is controlling a string of data, that you can store a message in and send to other data addresses really the function of a bitcoin?

..... yes? :) that's all that a ""colored coin"" is. 


Ultimately, down to the level of about 100 to 1000 satoshis is where the real game is. We're going to turn bitcoin into petabyte sized global database to store what really matters. Not trivial stuff like spending bitcoin to buy stuff.

Deep down I at least am trying to turn bitcoin into an uncensorable time stamp database. We'll use it to store records of who owns what.

You know, not everyone has the same goals. :) Just consider me to be along for the ride! Other people with other goals are welcome here too and I welcome them, and it's off to the races. We can fork the coin when needs are incompatible. We can't see the future, so who knows.

A single bitcoin will let you do the record keeping of a modestly sized credit union."
Aw rats, I hoped I was helping. :)
Whoa, this is a real thing. lol Thank you... I think.

"I did.  Until one night I got high, watched some OMG BITCOIN IS A BUBBLE videos on YT and almost had a panic attack.  Now I have double my savings and will NEVER do that again.

*To clarify, I'm never putting my savings into crypto again.  I'm definitely getting high again."
"here is something that may slightly cheer you up. 

1] you hang onto the theory that you wouldn't have cashed out on the first big jump and would've waited until now, which you probably would've. Meaning you most likely wouldn't be the multibillionaire you imagine yourself as. 

2] you could've invested a ton, and had it hacked/stolen or simply lost the key. 

3] there is still the chance that even today, it could more than triple in value, therefore it isn't too late. 


: ) hopefully this makes you feel better. "
I was thinking last night also.  $100 in btc in 2010 would be $10M today.  Fuuuuuuuudge!!!

Problem is that all the cryptos are highly linked.
I know I was just saying, personally I always preferred Colbert on Strangers With Candy, I really miss that show 
A little confused as to the distinction you're trying to make here.  Acting can be comedic and can be either scripted or improvisational.  This particular improv company was comedic, as are many.  
"Comedy is easy. Drama is hard.

Edit: [Breaking Bad, Seinfeld, Julia Louis Dreyfus, Cranston, Paul reference...](https://youtu.be/ovqM72em1dA?t=3m17s)

Edit2: The saying is 'Drama is easy, comedy is hard'. Later it became 'Dying is easy, comedy is hard'."
Standup is harder.
Freeze! Agent Michael Scarn, FBI. Hands up.

"I can't say for certain, nobody really can. A while back it jumped up to $70 and stayed there for so long while BTC took off. Who knows if the same won't happen here, it might sit steady where it is or drop a little while BTC goes on to $40,000+.

It's a weird market and I'm not going to pretend I have a crystal ball, Litecoin makes up about 25% of my portfolio, it's a good coin with a lot of room to grow."

You're not wrong, but if you do it right you can protect it better than cash in a bank account.  It's just takes a lot of work to figure out the best way to make it not worth the risk.  You have to really learn what you're doing and that takes time.

"I agree, but Bitcoin doesn't have any solutions for the scalability problem while other projects like Ripple, IOTA, DASH are already developing and testing. LN is just too complicated for mass adoption.

What I meant is that new people invest in Bitcoin just because it's going up, not because of it's technological capabilities and future development plans. So my guess is it will take about a year before people start really questioning Bitcoin more."
ETH isn't meant as a currency though.
I thought it was internet magic money
Oh man, guess that makes me the buffoon. Forgot about that line. Let's just forget I said anything. Cool?

"I disagree, if you want actual mass adoption you need something absolutely bulletproof and trustworthy or adoption will never be possible. Bitcoin has a much smaller attack surface and much more conservative development than everything else.

You can talk about sharding and tangles and shit but the more complex it is, the more likely it has a issue.

Bitcoin is comparatively simple and stable and that's what will bring the masses in and I all the LN demos I've seen look about as easy as using bitcoin now. "

"Oh, don’t get me wrong, I agree that there is no beating it and algorithmic trading is the reason markets are so efficient. No human could profit from arbitrage these days. It’s also the reason that it’s just not possible to make money consistently or substantially via day trading. 
I’m not disagreeing with what you said, but I remembered from my Series 66 exam that apparently about half of the stock market trading volume is machine trading and that there is apparently still quite a bit of human trading activity overall. I can find the section tomorrow. It’s also hard to see volume sometimes from things like dark pools and institutional trade through ETNs, so the information is definitely an estimate. 

Also, if you’re interested, look up the Flash Crash, where algorithmic trading exacerbates trading jumps at times. "

Past performance is not a guarantee that the opposite is going to happen either.
probably most important one was realizing that I wasn't taking college seriously and I was starting to skip more and more classes/study less without even realizing it.
You really think someone would do that, just go on the Internet and tell lies?
"I did it, because if you look at the bitcoin charts, it's 5 u shapes. Each time, it runs up in a big pump, collapses back down, does a big u shape up to previous ath, thn breaks out for another bubble. I literally just assumed, rightly or wrongly, that would happen again.

I have n clue why or how it happens, but it has happened, now 5 times. it's undeniable, and very clear on the charts. Unfortunately I sold at 6k, since thats the growth previous bubbles had seen. Still made a nice chunk, but its been hard to watch."
"> taken out my 401k , penalties and all, and invested in the beginning of the year and become a millionaire.

Yeah :/ I could only do that if I quit my job. I considered it, but it was too risky.

I also tried about a year ago to have my 401k be a bit more self-directed (I'm now stuck with a catalogue of 1000s of index funds, not individual stocks, meh), but I'm glad that I at least did that. 

As the joke goes (and it's true) - people will spend more time shopping for a refrigerator than figuring out how to invest their money. 

Hindsight can make you salty, but we're here, doing okay."
I think ETH has a 0.1% chance of ever getting a 100x (inflation adjusted)
lol
Ya even my litecoin is worth 4 times what it was a few months ago 
If you're following this industry you should be able to spot some of these early. But in my opinion it's a bit early for that to stop Bitcoin growth near term. A bit later, I agree.
I agree it has potential for another 100x, but not in a few years
The problem is that 99% of bitcoin demand is created by investors wanting to get rich and maybe 1% by people that actually use btc to buy goods. This can't be good right? If the price of btc stabilises we would be left with only 1% of the previous demand for the coin. 
"I think the next Huge News will be that a national government has begun accumulating Bitcoin as part of its strategic financial reserves. Heck, the news today about Bulgaria accidentally finding itself with Bitcoin equal to 20% of its national debt is a sort of accidental version of this. If it leads to other nations racing to secure some before the price goes stratospheric... it will make 2017 look like a mere prelude.

(In other news, if BTC keeps soaring a major geopolitical issue of 2018 will be dealing with the rolling blackouts that are starting to happen due to bitcoin mining. I'm serious. If you thought Bcash shills were bad, wait until governments start approaching devs about the ""PoW problem"".)"
It’s actually roughly half of the stock market trades are done by high-frequency traders and half by humans. 
It will come...

There is no crypto capable of succeeding at what bitcoin is currently failing. Throw these many users and transactions at ay crypto right now and they will fail like fuck. It's not that just bitcoin isn't ready, it's just that crypto itself isn't.
Gold is also a physical thing that is rare/hard to get. Crypto is a digital thing that is rare/hard to get. Could be overlooked as a small difference but I think it’s significant when making that comparison.
I don't know anything about investing in gold, but my impression is that the *value* remains relatively stable, but the *price* slowly rises (tracking inflation, basically).
I've thought about this but I play games a lot, and don't want to risk mining with this card and having to replace it.
Was a joke, not going to invest in something as volatile as bitcoin.

Confused is a good word here... it's the confidence that's dangerous. On the one hand, there are legendary investors and financial geniuses like Warren Buffett, Jamie Dimon, and John Bogle who are not confused at all, and say bitcoin is a fraud, the definition of a bubble, and should be avoided like the plague. Then there are VERY confident bitcoin advocates like the Winklevoss's, John McAfee, and endless tech bros who actually believe investing geniuses don't understand blockchain technology, and therefore the folks who have the deepest understanding in the world of investing are stupid and wrong. This is purely objective... I'm not advocating anything.

For me, yes. I dumped $10k into BTC from 2014 into 2015, average cost basis $350. It was money I could afford to lose at the time. It worked out well so far, but I haven't sold any yet so we'll see.

"Not sure, are you really asking? :)

It's a value, stored as satoshis in binary, out on the blockchain at a bitcoin address. (It's just a convention to represent something like 100 million satoshis as ""1.0"" bitcoin)

If you have the private key, you can sign a message that proves you control it. Then you can, in that message, combine it with others and send values to other addresses.
