The amount of people calling this a bubble... fuckin being calling this a bubble since $30. Either get in or step back on the bankers dick.
"For the people wondering ""when is a good time to buy"" - if you have already decided you want to buy, you just want to know when, I would suggest not trying to time the market. Instead, ""dollar cost average"" by buying some every week or every month. Then over time you will hit peaks and dips and you won't feel like you missed or lost too much overall. If you need help getting started, I wrote a guide called ""[Creating your personal bitcoin vault](https://beyourownbankbook.wordpress.com/2017/04/18/creating-your-personal-bitcoin-vault/)"" that has helped thousands of people at this point. Good luck and happy HODLing! "
