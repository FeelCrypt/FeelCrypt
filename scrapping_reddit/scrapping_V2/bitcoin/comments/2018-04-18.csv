Me too fuck sake hahah
"I didn't see it. I'm at work. We have a porn filter. I'm now logged being blocked by the porn filter.
    
Luckily I'm also the security guy. I needed to test the pornfilter."
Only sometimes, I think

"There's an xkcd for that

plus the black bars around it. it's hilarious.
Link does go to pornhub, but it ain't no nudity :)
Hilarious

It’s okay, they got the coins for free by hacking their own network
Bingo
Pretty sure that's the joke
And people who want to buy a new GPU
The plural of fish is fish.
The show must go on
Just said that outloud and cracked myself up again. 
"Perhaps he got inspired by Steve Ballmer.

He said he lost a lot but was happy with it since he has learned from it lol.
My dude, as a redditor for two months, you'll have to get used to our sarcastic and ambivalent nature when it comes to the grimness of reality. It's how we cope.
Wait! Now masturbait!!
It's mastur*bit* in this house!
Is this not the front page of the internet? Bad marketing. Easy to block subs. 
"because a couple of months ago the question was ""Why 2 months and not 6 months?"""
But it's not possible to alter an image
Didn't that happen weeks ago?
"Nope, it's about Verge (a scammy alt-coin) spending a huge amount of time talking about an upcoming partnership that would be ""huge"".  Then it turned out to be that they just paid a whole lot of money to pornhub to accept them as a payment option (in a very round-about, non-directly-integrated kind of way), after which the price tanked (as seen in this candlestick).

Nothing to do with Bitcoin."
I can animate the chart and try upload it, maybe they now accept chartporn?
So much jpeg
...in a bukkake party.
He is a troll 
XVG?
Lazy for the penis.
You’re a lie
Such a casual comment 
It's clearly a joke, but the title IS click bait so I don't know what the fuck you're on about.
Can someone change it to green?
That is way too perfect :D
Bitcoin and most crypto currency took a massive drop in price, losing tons of ppl money 
I wasexpecting a pornhub link, got disappointed.

I'm here to claim my medal, sir.
You almost got me to watch pornhub in class.
"I've seen this one but not on this platform.

Thank you BTW. I just looked at my first video on Pornhub. "
"We will see that they do, and we accept it, they are under the same rules and filters as everybody else. As I explained the way you connect are via VPN, so basically everyone is defined as being on the outside. You can't connect to our internal network without a VPN or physical access to your server room.
    
If it's a personal device not controlled by the company, we will not know your username. Info about your device will be logged. We can also see where you are. Not very exactly, but accurate enough that we will probably be able to find out who you are. If you connect via cable, it's actually harder to see where you are, I will know which floor and maybe department depending on that floors layout. We've had to find devices twice the last year as they was clearly infected. One was someone working there from another company and one was a personal PC."
"No dislikes 90 % likes 

Hmmmmmmmmmmmmm"
Cool story bro
Why 6 months and not 6 years?
Is this meant to be a joke or do you not understand what click bait actually is?
click bait? More like wick bait! Amirite
Look at all the thumbs up  
Click masturbait
I think he post it because most of the trades got fucked during th recent crashes in the community and just want to have some fun in this thread
That means you are on voat?
A bit coitus.
What your mum did last night
Haha only cos it’s on Pornhub 
Pornhub announced they will be accepting a Cryptocurrency called verge yesterday. The price has since plummeted 
Looks like a standard chart from most exchanges. Binance is great 
it is, I have seen it too many times

Told* x2, burst*, how he's*

Love the tongue flicking haha
I wonder what happened to that guy, after the crash.
Found one of the thousands getting fucked hard!

"Yeah, the two are not mutually exclusive. As for the rest of your post I have no idea what you're babbling about.

"
Think the clickbait comment is in reference to the porn vid name.
Fuck off
It is not spelled MASTURBATE, nor “masturbait”it is spelled “masterbate” here in Reddit, didn’t you know? A 5 week old redditor should know by now. 
MasterbateCash is Roger's true vision of porn.
*YOU WON'T BELIEVE...*
Object oriented comment
By prophecies you mean Final Fantasy right?
"Auch, we know a lot, and we don't tell, and we pretend we don't know.
    
We know who struggles in their marriage, who is struggling with diseases, financial stuff and so on."
I can assure you, if I catch you using a VPN other than the one of the two we provide and control out of work, you have some explaining to do. Unless you had a good explanation it would be a bigger offence than being caught watching porn. It would trigger a lot of alarms.
He actually says he tested more porn sites, clever guy.
bitcoNEEEEEEEEEEEECT
I promptly tested a few others sites also. Nothing suspicious at all.
Heh
"""I wasn't looking at porn, I was looking at all the gun videos from people who recently ditched YouTube""

Thanks for the info. I'm not trying to do anything nefarious at work online. How about someone using a personal device (cellphone) using a VPN on the company network just to browse or stream video? Would you be able to differentiate that from a customer using your WiFi vs. employee? 
Lame attempt to get onto a gold train that will never come.
Why couldn't it be possible?  
I clicked on a video that was supposedly Karlee Grey doing anal according to the title, but no butt stuff was in the video.
Dickbait 
Pornstars hate him.
"Yes, WiFi goes via the same IDS and FW as the rest. All company cellphones, tablets and computers are always connected via VPN, even if you are on premises. You have exactly the same environment on your equipment inside as outside. We have a lot of people working remote, actually I am too. I work about 2000km away from main office.
    
The worst breaches we have had have been from the inside. Some because of pure stupidity and some intentional malicious. People take shortcuts, I can understand that. We work hard to maintain a secure environment without making it hard for people to do their work. The way we do it now seem to work OK. Non tech people don't have to think about VPN and stuff. They can work wherever they want and not learn new environments. VPN connects as you log in.
    
Here is how you can get around me if you need to. Use SSH. Set up an SSH tunnel and make sure your DNS queries are routed through that tunnel. SSH is widely used and would not trigger any red flags."
Dynamically scripted comment 
"Is it even possible for a video on a porn site to be called ""clickbait""?"
Cool your jets, Sid. 
what this business is doing to disrupt this billion dollar industry!
Well, fuck. 
That's cool. I was wondering what you do with those. How about using a VPN on a cellphone while using the company WiFi? Does that trigger any red flags?
B connect
Lemme Google it...be back shortly! 
Underrated comment

If you have Adblock 
Mistakes like this happen and you are one lucky bastard. At my last job, the IT manager is my best friend’s husband. Sometimes I wonder what he knows about me. 😐🤫
"""I needed to tits... I mean, test! Test the porn filter"""
Always use a VPN at work security guy. 
Better test a bunch of non porn sites that should be blocked, just to make it look like a real test 
I'll give you a hint.. wassup wassup wassuuuuuup
Yeah, try explaining that one to IT. 
"Ofcourse... ""test"""
Indeed. You use C++ if you want to put in effort. You use C# if you want to *save* effort.

"YES. The most pain in my life is when people who want to mine bit coin tell me to ""just buy a console"" when I'm complaint about the price of the 1080 that I was about to buy before the price sky rocketed. "

And people with annoying friends who bought Bitcoin

That is good to know. I was worried he would harm himself.
You're god damn right.
B♯, B♮, but don't B♭
They should be telling you to buy a GPU and start mining.. you might want to look for better friends
Say it how you like, words are just things. Besides his name is doothewop, which is either a misspelling or misuse of doo-wop, or the instigation of racist sexual assault against Italians. He doesn't have any moral authority to tell you about words. And yes I assumed his gender and no I don't give a fuck.
"Clearly a joke but still clickbait?

I could be wrong but... has anyone ever received a medal for uploading  joke to a porn site?

Yadda yadda yadda...Poe's Law...hyperbole."
I must admit he’s pulled off a rare feat with the 1.3k positive karma post and the slightly negative post side by side though. 
Come to /pol and tell me about grim reality. 
Verily, my dude
And realize that we hate everyone (except Keanu Reeves) including ourselves. 
Um you guys mean MASTERBATE correct?? What’s up with peeps who can’t spell anymore..

You won't believe what happens next!!!
Cherry picking wasn't a good idea when the person you're describing (?) did it either.

"Is this serious?
