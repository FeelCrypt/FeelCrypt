"I read that thing like I read a work-related technical journal article.
""Okay, read the title of the white paper... skim....look at graph...skim-skim-skim...table, graphic ... Summary...DONE!!""
Shortly thereafter:
""Buy, buy, buy..... aaaaand, HODL."""
Bitcoin does do quite a few things that fiat isn't able to. It is trustless, so you are not exposed to counterparty risk. It is decentralised, borderless and censorship resistant, meaning you are not subject to government's monetary policy. Look at Greece as a place where citizens were screwed by the government when the economy faulted. It is inherently deflationary and can be used to store value, something that is important in an environment with hyper-inflation, see: Venezuela or Zimbabwe. I think fiat is important and it's not going anywhere, but there is definitely value in crypto - how much valuation it should have I think is the question.
