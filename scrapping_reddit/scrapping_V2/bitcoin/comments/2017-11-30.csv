Currently dipping!
That would be a twilight zone-esque hell. To recall yourself spending $100 on BTC when it wsa under a dollar but not remembering your wallet seed. Or having kept them on MtGox
Yeah, I’m like that as well. I don’t have enough disposable income to set aside a sizeable amount for an investment of any sort. But now i realize that my laziness prevented me getting in crypto when it was mineable on a CPU, or at least when I could buy BTC for $1 per coin. Ah well.
Oh I have plenty invested now. But its too late for the moon. Ill settle for the stratosphere 
I feel like we need a support group for those of us who missed out during the earlier days. I keep telling myself now that better late than never, but it still hurts lol
I've been preaching the tech for years though. Oh and I used to buy contraband with them so I guess I contributed to the currency aspect. Just dont get the reap the rewards of the hodlers. But that's ok, Im just happy to have been a part of the paradigm shift. It does suck that all my friends and family assume I was hording them though, Im embarrassed to admit the truth
still have no use? lol tell that to my closing agent tomorrow morning when im closing on my new home
"You're wrong. They are useful. You can use them at lots of major retailers... so... yeah. 

[Proof](https://99bitcoins.com/who-accepts-bitcoins-payment-companies-stores-take-bitcoins/)"
Likely because they're so useful, but what do I know.
 I went to a concert in San Francisco month ago, used bitcoin to buy the tickets, pay for the hotel and buy all my food and drinks for 36 hours I was there… I don’t know what you’re talking about when you say you can’t use them for anything. 
Nope.
Well, it is a bubble. Everyone is investing into it, hoping to get even more out of it. Just wait until the bubble burst.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Gox


Yeh, back in 2014. ""850,000 bitcoins [...] were stolen straight out of the Mt. Gox hot wallet over time"". I wish I had access to that wallet."
They had someone steal all their coins.  I had 100 coins in them when they were hacked :(
"It is estimated that whoever Satoshi is, he (or she or they) have about 1 million Bitcoins. At $10k per coin that's $10 billion.

Saving them for $100k / coin, obviously."
No because it was a steal to sell at 10 bucks then 70 bucks the last chunk went. 
well since he is not bashing himself for selling at 2.40 I am pretty sure he has some left

They got hacked in like 2014.
"I have some from 2011, bought at $11. Forgot about them, harddrive died, I've decided I'm going to recover them @ $20,000. 

That's my price. If it crashes...whatever I'm only out a little bit. If I can't recover them, whatever I'm only out a little bit. "

"Is that like a 8.5 trillion dollars? 

I can’t even do that math mentally and it’s all zeroes. What the fuck. "

"Jesus, you could have cashed out an even million if you sold at 10k.

Really though, damn that sucks!"
"Not really, I gave away thousands when they were worth pennies on the dollar days after launch. I believed in the idea. Actually heard about it here on Reddit and thought it was cool. 

I'm not going to kick myself for being a college kid and selling each for a few bucks making thousands of dollars. It was a rational move. I literally spent pocket change to buy them and now made thousands. People would consider it stupid to NOT take 100x return on something...

The only thing I kick myself for is day trading and losing money by not being patient enough. I should have just set it and forget it. But that's sort of hard when you're a broke college kid and your portfolio is fluctuating by thousands a day. "
Or he just learned to accept it... like me and my friends selling at around $20 when we were in college. Without people making early transactions, BTC wouldn’t be where it is today anyway.

"> in San Francisco 

Such a common mistake with tech. ""If it works in San Francisco it works everywhere"".

Just in the last 10 hours the value has ranged between $9,021 and $10,640. So over even just that 36 hours you better have a lot of extra money in bitcoin or another payment method or you might be sleeping on the streets with no food or drink (or arrested for failure to pay).

How far in advance did you plan this? Just a month ago Bitcoin was around 6,000. So if you paid for anything just a month ahead of time suddenly you paid 50%-100% more. 

What if it was the opposite and went from 11,000 to 6,000 in a month (easily possible). Suddenly most people would have a plane ticket, but not enough money to pay for the rest of the trip."

But the transaction fees for normal-sized purchases are much higher than credit card fees.
Why would I use bitcoin to buy a cup of coffee when the confirmations take 30 min and the transaction costs are nearly worth the price of the coffee? 
Even if they are accepted they really are very poor for that purpose because the value isn't at all stable. You can't really do the buy some then use them right away (and what would be the point then since you could probably use the other payment option), because they take too long.
"> Starbucks across Canada

Where? I've never seen anything like that in and around the GTA or in Vancouver."
"> I would sell you my house for bitcoin  

Obviously, because the value keeps on rising (for now). The real question is why would anyone agree to buy your house in btc? You agree a price (say 10 btc) and in the month or two that it takes to close the deal, the price in USD just doubled. Likewise, nobody wants to pay people in btc because a salary would be so volatile. You'd go broke."
Can i possibly just cash out large sums of money from bitcoin?
For a big slow transaction, it makes sense to me, but I thought the confirmations were too slow for businesses like Starbucks?
Hmm? I’m in management at Starbucks in Canada and have no mechanism for accepting bitcoin.

Uh, most stocks don’t pay an investment? Yeah, I guess if you’re only buying Large Cap stocks...I work in the industry and that’s definitely not true. Not to mention you can write options on your long positions to generate income. So even if you aren’t receiving divs you can generate income with a low risk.
"For one, this isn't really a solid proof or reason that bitcoin isn't speculation (or that speculation is a solid investment), since it effectively just say ""what about stocks?"". It doesn't attempt to explain why something could be a solid investment and not a bubble even if there is no inherent value to anyone, it just says that stocks are just as much of a bubble.  
Secondly, there is clearly a fundamental misunderstanding of stocks. Stocks are a share of a company, a percentage of ownership. Even if that ownership doesn't pay dividends or even grant voting rights. In the worst case scenario of a company going bankrupt, you own a portion of that companies assets, and will be able to collect a percentage of their assets after debts are paid. Yes, stock prices can fluctuate independently of the companies profitability, because people speculate on stocks as they do any other investment, but speculating that the companies profits will go up is completely different from speculating on something with no inherent value. Speculating on a companies value can be an informed decision based on facts that the company will grow, and it can be right most of the time for everyone who speculates it because the whole economy grows and each individual company grows with it. Speculating on something without inherent value is what's called a bubble, you are speculating only that ""some greater fool"" will be willing to pay more than you did in the future, and is inherently unsustainable because eventually, when there is no greater fool with enough money to meaningfully effect the price, all the people who only ""invested"" in speculating that others would pay more will sell, since that was their intention all along. There is no point at which such a thing would happen for a companies stocks unless the company went bankrupt, in which case stockholders are at least entitles to a percentage of the companies assets and so there is still a price floor to which the stock will drop.  
All of this is not to say that bitcoin is a bad investment, to be clear, this is just a particularly bad argument for investing in bitcoins. Bitcoin does have inherent value for trading, but if you believe that the majority of bitcoins valuation is speculation on bitcoins valuation, you should recognize that that is a bubble (which seems like a pretty sound hypotheses to me given its meteoric rise in price which I would guess is primarily caused by a scarcity caused by people investing in bitcoin, but I don't know the actual transaction rates and thus demand for BTC as currency which is inherently valuable)"
"It's a bit different with stocks tho:

a) the fact that a company doesn't pay a dividend now doesn't imply it won't tomorrow. It's not really relevant if it does, google pays no dividend and invests everything.

b) as a stock owner you own a % of a business and have a vote in its decisions"
Didnt read. No paragraphs
"That's dumb as hell. The reason companies don't need to pay out dividends is because the ownership of the share represents incorporates the dividends.

Let's say you own 1% of Company A. Company A has assets worth $100,000 and your share is valued at $1,000 (this is a super simple example). If Company A has revenues of $1,000 then they could give each of their 100 shareholders $10 and continue to be worth $100,000. That's a dividend. But if they don't declare the dividend then they now have assets of $101,000, and you still own 1% of the company. Your share is now worth $1,010. You can simply sell 1% of your share and give yourself an effective dividend, getting your $10 and keeping your holdings steady at $1,000.

When you buy stocks you're buying a share of ownership in an enterprise, ideally a successful one. When it succeeds it doesn't matter whether they give you cash or whether they roll that cash back into the company, you own a share of that cash anyway.

It's nothing to do with Greater Fool Theory. Netflix has never paid dividends but if you were to offer to pay a Netflix shareholder twice what he paid for his shares five years ago you would not be a greater fool. The value of the underlying asset has changed therefore the value of ownership of that asset through shares has changed."
I could be wrong, but investing in it right now sounds like a huge risk. It could go at any moment, and go hard. Then it'll probably recover pretty quickly from people who wish they got in the last time it was low. 
"Yeah, you can’t really get stuck on “what if I held out” because first off, you can’t do anything about it. Secondly, early transactions facilitated the growth and acceptance of BTC. There are stupid articles saying “the first pizza bought with bitcoins is worth $100M!” but that’s not the case at all because without that pizza being bought, BTC wouldn’t be worth $10k. 

It would be nice to not have to work anymore or at least have a fully paid off house though..."
"Depends on how much you're making.

I doubt you'd want to flaunt your bank account if you were making $100,000 per month or had $10,000,000 in your bank account.

People get greedy for money."
Yep.... it just sucks because even having 1 or 2 leftover would be very helpful right now with some stuff I have going on but who’s to say I wouldn’t have sold at $1000? I probably would have.

That's assuming that any/much of the value of Bitcoin has anything to do with its actual usefulness as a currency. 
That's what a slave would say.
That’s been a conservative value for some time. We’re not supposed to know/realize the wealth and power of today’s oligarchs stems back to industry’s that were immoral (slavery) or part of the beginning of our throttled economy (lobbyist corporate types interested in nothing but profit).

"I think how much you have in bitcoin is more like asking how much did you win in a lottery. More to do with how lucky did you get, than how rich you are. Its also something that you might assume someone is very happy about, and might actually want to talk/boast about.

Also, in my experience people tend to ask about wages and rent. I don't ask people, but I assume that if someone asks then they are comfortable sharing as well. Might be a small cultural difference though, since I'm not in the US.

Though personally if I won the lottery I wouldn't tell anyone, unless/until I did something that required an explanation. Which I might not do anyway.

But the thing is I wouldn't even say I won the lottery. If someone comes up to me and says they won the lottery, of course I'll ask how much. Same with bitcoin. If you say you bought some, I'd ask how much."

As a vendor you can accept that as payment and not have to worry about the % that credit card transaction processing is taking off the top of all sales.
capital flight is the one thing that I honestly think adds inherent value. 
you know you can exchange them for several different things, like directly to paypal. 
"Anything a vendor sells who is willing to accept bitoin in payment.  These vendors are widespread and include Starbucks across Canada, a bunch of stores in Korea, some guy in Slovakia selling really good meth, a different guy in Austria selling sex slaves.

So long as people are willing to accept bitcoin as payment for goods or services it will have value. Because it becomes rarer with higher rates of adoption it will gain value over time. "

Your falling for a common fallacy. Stuff is worth what you pay for it at the time, it doesn't matter if the currency or the item goes up or down in price in the future.
"From the recent Change My View thread:

>I understand where you are coming from, but my argument is that to some degree, the greater fool theory is irrelevent and not particularly uncommon even in the accepted stock markets of the world.
Most stocks right now that you buy in companies off things like the New York Stock Exchange do not pay dividends, ie there are not quarterly or annual payouts of profits to stockholding investors. Furthermore, there is nothing necessarily linking stock value to profits. For instance it is entirely possible that a company loses money, but its stock value still goes up anyway. This leads to a certain divorce from reality in some ways. The stock itself is worthless (it pays you nothing), beyond what a 2nd person is willing to pay for it for whatever reason
So why the heck can say Tesla's stock value go up like this over the past year, when during that same time period they have posted losses >$200 million each quarter!? Now you might say, /r/taranaki, its because people think in 10 years Tesla might be making large profits. Sure. Except I would also say, in such a scenario, is that piece of (now electronic) paper that sits in your vault paying you any more money w/ the company making millions in profits versus millions in losses? They answer is NO! Its still paying out $0 in dividends. In fact its only value is that now other people will want to buy the stock, and then sell it to someone else on the thought they will expect SOMEONE ELSE to want it for more money if quarterly reports look good. Why!? Because thats just what people are ""supposed to do"". But implicitly if someone declared tomorrow stocks can no longer be traded, then you still have a worthless piece of paper in a profit or loss scenario(because it doesnt pay dividends).
Do you kind of get the shell game that goes on in real stocks? Its the exact same speculation that goes on w/ bitcoin. People want bitcoin, because they believe that other people will want it based on the thought it will keep going up. People want Tesla stock on the thought that OTHER people will want it due to the thought that if earnings go up a 3rd person will want it for even more (even though increased earnings in a vacuum doesnt help or hurt the owner of the stock if he cant trade it to a 3rd party)

Everyone thinking its a bubble is what has allowed BTC to keep growing. If everyone thought it was a sure thing, then it probably wouldn't stand the test of time it has.
I dont think its fair to say its a bubble. it abosolutely has uses. Its great for money laundering, buying drugs, and hiding wealth.
I know its a bubble, I know I can't predict it, and I know I'm not lucky. Still considering buying some (actually just did, but such a negligible amount it won't make any difference whether it quadruples or goes to 0).
850,000(10,000) = 8.5 billion dollars. 6 digit number * 10 * 10 * 10 * 10 = 10 digit number.
"Just use scientific notation. 8.5e5 * 1e4 = 8.5e9 or 8.5 Gigadollars. I'm also now petitioning for us to re brand Billionaires to Giganaires.

You were off by a few orders of magnitude.

billion...
Same. I'd have over half a mil if I didn't sell. Whoops! I don't stress out over it though, just a lesson learned on this journey we call life.
yeah youre right that was kinda dumb lol
Wait wait wait really?! That’s amazing! Congrats y’all! It is capable of being exchanges at, lets say, a bank? Or would you just have to find like a car dealer that took bitcoin? Just outta curiosity, how many bitcoins do y’all have?
"Just to rub it in a bit, why not message the ex back and tell her this:  ""I am sorry that I haven't had a chance to reply because in addition to my career and family, I've now made millions in Bitcoin and have been so busy working with financial advisors figuring out how to handle so much wealth.

"Don't forget ""New lambo"" "

Hahahaha
Bitcoin comments are literally the most positive on Reddit right now. It's like all the trolls and shit-posters are just too stoked that their Bitcoin is skyrocketing 😂
"True story... Literally this exact thing happened to me, but not in the context of bitcoin. I have an ex, started dating after I came back from a Mormon mission for a couple years in South Africa, so I was 22 years old at the time. We even got engaged after about 10 months of dating. Then, 2 months into the engagement, she cheats on me and says, ""I just want someone with more ambition I guess. You're just a programmer. Sorry."" Knowing her, what this really meant was she thought I was too much of a computer geek, my Computer Science degree I was enrolled in (and molecular and cellular biology double major) was not going to make as much money as a ""business"" guy, of what she kept telling me I should really be doing.

Well that was it. Queue some years later, I finish grad school, I am working solidly in computational biology, I'm published, I'm making 6 figures, and my position at my company is Chief Technology Officer (CTO) on my LinkedIn, and she messages me saying BS like we should catch up, she's in town, she'd love to see me and then trying to throw in little memories of old times. Note, I am married now with kids and she is married with a kid, and she hasn't talked to me in years but has the balls to say and I quote, roughly, ""Things are pretty rough. [Name of husband] and I haven't been getting along, and he got diagnosed with cancer and I have been having a hard time with it. He doesn't seem interested in going for promotions anymore at work. I am so impressed with how well you are doing. You are so smart and funny. Want to catch up? You can call me at [X] time as my husband won't be home then.""

Somehow she thought that would make me want to call her lol. Ya, I did not ever meet up with her since, nor did I care to, and she has reached out at least half a dozen times over the last few years. Oh and ya, she doesn't work and doesn't like working. My wife now complains that she doesn't work enough, even though she could stay at home. Who sounds like the person I'd rather be with? lol

It's amazing how many ""old friends"" reach out to you when they find out you are having success."
Getting rich is the male equivalent of losing weight and getting a boob job.
This. My girlfriend said in a fight “you’re one to talk you waste all your time reading about bitcoin...” to which I replied “do you have any fucking idea how much money I’ve made with bitcoin?” All of a sudden it wasn’t such an insult in her eyes. 
“Hey Karen, sorry i cant hear you bitch, I’m in my helicopter.”
Oh wow that is fabulous.
James is currently on the moon in his lambo.

Lmao
You can't see it, but I'm laughing really really hard, waaay pass LOL.

HAHAHAHA priceless.

"And why is the sentence fragment, ""investing in real estate,"" tossed into the middle of the sentence?   "
"Yes, it should. ""Everyone"" is a pronoun referring to the whole group at once, it doesn't combine with ""of your friends"" that way. 

Instead, as you say, you would use ""every one"" - effectively meaning ""each individual"". You then specify the group you're picking individuals from after the ""of"".

But ""Everyone else is doing X"" or ""Everyone you know is doing X"" would be fine, and of course they sound almost exactly the same when spoken, so it's commonly confused."

Maybe they're just curious if you're doing well off it and don't want your money?

I like seeing friends do well and I would like to congratulate him if he has made a lot is all.

This memory hurts my heart.

When Bitcoin hit $100 I said, ""I would buy some at $50 because this is just too expensive right now."" I said the same thing at $500, $1k, and even last month at $6.9k.

This memory hurts my heart.

At one point I had .75 BTC and a few dozen LTC I had acquired from mining back the the mtgox days that I lost when my hard drive crashed, but I didn't even care then because I always thought they were worthless.

This memory also hurts my heart.

I got tired of seeing bitcoin double in value every two months and thinking about buying in but never doing it. Set up a weekly payin of just a couple hundred a month. I'm sure I missed the get rich train, but that feeling of being tired of not making any attempts to make myself financially independent is why I finally bought into bitcoin and put my first payment to my Roth IRA. At least this way even if I don't make anything I won't be left feeling like I never tried anything.

My family is pretty well-off, so I think that is what made me initially interesting to her, in looking back at it.
"Haha if only I could say millions. I made the mistake of rather than being a ""holder"" I kept spending it every time it spiked. I bought tons of stuff off Dell over the years.

It has over 50% market share right now but monopoly is impossible in competing currencies in the long run. If a certain Blockchain does something better than another than people will use that one. Bitcoin has so much market share because crypto is in its infancy. People don't widely use Blockchain and definitely don't know there are different types. So, at the moment Bitcoin IS crypto because the idea is still so foreign but it won't be like that forever.
"I'll just chime in and say in term of marketcap, its way biggest but many alts also have high market caps. Imo it's very unimportant to measure this but you will see this argument alot that other coins are ""gaining"". However if you look to real useage, amount of people who actually use it for other things than swingtrading, and most importantly imo.. progress in development of technology, nothing comes close to bitcoin"

"Good luck getting the timing right. Sure, it can and does work.

"That was a joke. 

I'm heavily heavily advising against short term trades to make quick money. Bitcoin is so volatile - it rose and tell 20% in the last half of a day-  that buying and selling the same day has as much accuracy as betting on a coin flip. "
"I tried to make a max card purchase on Coinbase last night because it was growing $100 per breath practically. Said it went through but immediately sent an email saying it was rejected. 

Then it turned and went down nearly $1500. So hey, thanks for the reject Coinbase! "
Started the year with a bunch of dogecoin I had forgotten about. I put it into LTC, rode the initial wave above $10 all the way to 35ish. Then proceeded to trade back and forth to bitcoin. If I had held, I would have 18 LTC right now. If I had expertly traded the dips and rises. I might have had 20k worth of crypto. Instead I turned my 18 LTC into 12 and gave up trying to get ahead by trading
He asked if there's a better cryptocurrency than bitcoin right now. This was just a small dip, we're used to them and it doesn't require any action. Bitcoin has tremendously more computational power securing the network than any other cryptocurrency. No one is claiming to know if bitcoin will still be the gold standard of cryptocurrencies in 20 years, but right now it's in a league of its own and the other cryptocurrencies are tied to what happens to bitcoin. Bitcoin has also been much more peer reviewed and tested than any other cryptocurrency and it has been working for 9 years. If another cryptocurrency replaces bitcoin at the helm, it won't happen overnight. Cryptocurrencies can coexist without any issue.
It's worth it. I put in $100 my junior year of high school in 2013 when it was at $1,200 and a week later it crashed. I got mad and forgot about it and a few years later my friend reminded me about bitcoin and I was astonished to find it was worth over 5,000/btc. Now that .1 btc is worth over around $1000, not a bad return from a stupid purchase I made as a highschooler.

It is. But altcoin volatility leaves btc in the dust.

Yeah I just checked GDAX and was surprised it dipped so low today. I am setting up a Coinbase today so I can be more prepared. I was ready to buy earlier, but the whole wallet thing is still confusing me a bit so I am researching more before I jump in, the last thing I want to do is buy $250 worth, then not have it secured or lose it somehow. 
Almost every currency has a scaling issue at the moment but it's because excitement is building rapidly and the infrastructure is struggling to keep pace. The currencies that overcome these issues (the ones with strong developers and goals) will be more favored than other coins. The lightning network is something like a layer being added to bitcoin to try and speed up transactions but I truly don't know enough about it to talk in detail. I just know that 2017 definitely instilled some motivation to the developers to scale quickly and efficiently

Bitcoin does all the essentials for a crypto currency well enough. Of course there are others which are better and have several features, but Bitcoin is just good enough to make the others not matter.

Well, ~15% if you're not going by 1 minute extrema. Given that the growth retracted only to where it had been 24 hours previously I don't see it as a big dip at all, no. I guess this is all personal opinion though.

Yes, it would be a $1500 profit, the fees are negligible. You can make some money trading like this, but sooner or later (and usually sooner than later), bitcoin is going to do something unexpected and you won't be able to buy your bitcoins back for a price you consider affordable. It's unwise to think that you can time the market.

"that's my strategy since 2013. I am so fucking rich my friends are jealous.

HODL buy dips. No white hairs on crashes."
Same dammit coinbase
This is what people say when they don’t understand anything about Blockchain. 
"Supply & Demand, plain and simple.

Price goes up when demand outweighs supply (lots of people trying to enter the market.) Price goes down when supply outweighs demand (some whale/lots of people decide to cash out of their purchases or sell their mined coins for cash.)

The difference with Bitcoin is everything is exaggerated. Because there are so many people who are in to make a quick buck, they emphasize these price swings with excitement in both directions. There is overreaction to price increases, causing massive FOMO.

When things start going down, lots of people panic, and unfortunately make the mistake of selling. This increases supply further and reduces the price further. There are only so many stupid people though, and only so many people who want to cash out, so eventually the selling stops, people who understand investing or Bitcoin buy back in during massive drops which corrects the price.

That’s my microeconomic look at crypto fluctuations."
I think you mean quantummemes. At such a micro scale even memephysicists don't understand them. The memewave function collapses once a meme is observed, so the intention of the meme creator is different depending on the your relative pov in memespacetime.
The second law of thermodynamemes can never be broken.
"Bitcoin is an asset which has never existed before.

It is similar to gold.
Supply is finite.
Takes effort and resources to produce.
Functions as a store of value.
Can be used to facilitate commerce.

On this last point, gold isn't widely used anymore, but it once was.

Gold has serious drawbacks. 
Its heavy.
If you want to pay someone in gold you have to do it in person which could be dangerous if they are some rando.  Doing it remotely requires secure transport and some way to guarantee payment.

So here comes bitcoin, a deflationary asset like gold, with the liquidity of credit cards, no dependence on a third party, the ability to transact globally and some privacy (not enough which is one issue with bitcoin).  

The financial sector is having a problem grokking the potential and since its growing so fast, the only other scenario that seems close to what we are seeing are the many many bubbles we have seen over the course of human history.  So people who aren't visionaries are dismissive calling bitcoin tulips and bubbles and claiming every correction is a sign that bitcoin is doomed.

You are absolutely right about mining being an energy suck and the arms race going on can't continue.  I am not sure how that is going to ultimately get resolved.

On the subject of consumer surplus.  There are only 16 million bitcoin in existence.  Of those, probably 4 million are lost, in wallets that have no private keys,  or are otherwise not in circulation.  that leaves 12 million coins in supply.  Coinbase at last report has some 10 million users.  There's barely enough supply for all of coinbase's users to have 1 each.  Demand is through the roof and every dip is seen as a sale.

This isn't a bubble, its the beginning of a [technology adoption curve](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_adoption_life_cycle) and things are going to start moving very quickly over the next 24 to 36 months.

edit to change ""in the next 24 to 36 months"" to ""over the next"" because momentum is already building.

"
"It will undoubtedly ""crash"" but I like to call it a correction. Even if bitcoin falls to $1500 it still would have had an amazing year. There is so much excitement in the space because of the potential of the technology which, in my opinion, is the most important thing since the internet itself.
The electricity is an issue but electricity costs will fall rapidly with the introduction of cheap renewables. 
This is a completely new asset, these cryptocurrencies. It's more of an ecosystem that can do many things and facilitate many transactions. 
Kinda rambling.
Just a big fan of crypto. It's the future!"
Now would be a good time to retroactively buy bitcoin at 2010 prices. 
I fucking love you guys
Love this! 
Most people think that they paid too much for their bitcoins when they buy them. People who get in because of their fear of missing out and who manage to survive their first large dip don't tend to exit after the rebound because their fear of missing out stays with them. We continuously warn people that they shouldn't invest more than they're willing to lose, that it's a highly volatile market and that panic selling is the worst thing that you can do. For the past 9 years, the only people who lost money were the panic sellers. Everyone else was handsomely rewarded.

Hi i do not know much about bitcoin but a bit about economics. Doesn't this market seem like a huge potential to plunge once the bubble bursts? Also, I feel as though consumer surplus is actually reduced and there are ridiculous amount of power that go into mining. Again i'm in no way against, Im just wondering if these things are possible outcomes from someone more informed

#100K MEME's COMING UP !
When it crashes and is still staying above 9k, I will take it.
We need to turn memes up to 11, then.
"Looking forward to those.

Also 420 memes and 666 memes."
I am pretty sure the run up from 9k -> 10K was fueled purely by memes
Hodling enabled.
I guess Im a hodler. I dont even know how to sell.
We have the technology. 
Not fair. We didn't have time to prepare memes.
"I mean, maybe my expectations are off, but it's currently holding fairly steady at -1% from yesterday, +20% from last week, and +60% from last month.

"**Technology adoption life cycle**

The technology adoption lifecycle is a sociological model that describes the adoption or acceptance of a new product or innovation, according to the demographic and psychological characteristics of defined adopter groups. The process of adoption over time is typically illustrated as a classical normal distribution or ""bell curve"". The model indicates that the first group of people to use a new product is called ""innovators"", followed by ""early adopters"". Next come the early majority and late majority, and the last group to eventually adopt a product are called ""phobics."" Phobics use the cloud without knowing they are doing.

Or one of the dozen other competing cryptocurrencies will over take it. Or some new technology will come out and obsolete all cryptocurrencies.

Investing based on past performance is not an investment strategy. Past performance only tells you what you should have done in the past.

Buying in at 11,000 because you wished you bought in at 1,000 doesn't mean its going to go to 111,000.

The first time bitcoin hit $1,000, it took 4 years for it to reach that point again, meaning almost any other investment would have gotten you a better return."
It took three retracings and I'm now finally numb to them. No more panic selling. No more trying to sell and buy back lower insanity. Just sitting back and picking up a little more if it goes lower. God bless this reddit for showing the ways of the HODL.

"I've watched videos showing the different types of indicators and it seems fairly simple to use MACD and just watch for the crossover. Especially with a very apparent drop such as this. The turnaround is trickier but it just needs to be a better turnout than what you sold for so you have like $1500 dollars for it to rise before you miss your chance.

I missed where you talked about everyday fluctuations. So, even with those can't you do this? I don't know about transaction times or fees, but I imagine those would be the only hinderances."
