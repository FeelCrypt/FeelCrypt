"I don't want to think about everything I used and sold in 2012, but it's one of the reason we are at this price now.

I still have a very good number, but I can't help but think, what if?"
Never sell all them coins. Should have sold only half.
Don't feel bad. Imagine the guy with $500 worth of APPL stock who sold it in 1980. If no one ever sold there would be no market and the price would be effectively zero.
Dude think about this: 115 ish btc is a million bucks
Just know when to fodl them.

I honestly think that forums and reddit dont react fast enough to the way crypto moves. I am a big fan of Discord and Slack to stay up to date and I like the real time interaction. [I hang out here in this discord](https://discord.gg/zze64vd). I like it because the majority of the members are crypto nerds like me who are extremely active in the market. Questions are answered quickly and TA charts are posted all the time. I always have something to read or talk about here

"I know it was just a joke following OP. I’ve taken it off now since people didn’t like the humor, understandably I suppose if we’re trying to cut spam.

Ohhhhh. Did it go up a lot today err
It won't be crazier than the times it broke the other milestones. $10,000 is where it's at. A large portion of bitcoiners look at the price in another currency. I'm waiting for it to break 7,000€.

"If you have no influence on the price than it is a game of chance..i.e. gamble. Some are winners some are loosera. 
For example you cannot say that Elon Musk is lucky because he has influence on his business...

What influence do you have?

Among 1100 cryptocurrencies only 3 to 5 % can make you profit. What is this if not a game of chance?

If you were lucky enought to have bought early on you are now a millionare. You dont need brain..just plain simple luck.

So yes.. bitcoin lottery winnera."
You don't know what you're talking about and it shows. It's a very innovative technology to store and transfer value. It isn't controlled by anyone. Anyone could be a part of it at any point in the past 9 years. There isn't a single thing about bitcoin that is a scam.

Well, your car does appear to be parked facing a grassy lot, and not the road, so that might be the problem. Perhaps you should head onto the road and try again.

Buying a lottery ticket is a -EV gamble.

Yeah I just found out about it a couple months ago when I was watching[ savagegeese's review on the Alfa Giulia QV.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCbKlF53KSM) He talked a bit about how it was one of the last non-Ferrari vehicles they helped engineer before they split off from FCA.

A base 328i vs a base 300 is what I was talking about. And if you spend $50k on a 300, you could've gotten the SRT a couple years back which kicks the fuck out of any 328
But you could always have more Karma.
Get him!
what features does a Chrysler have that a bmw doesn't? I've driven both and the 3 series is so much nicer to drive and Ill take the 340 xdrive over that SRT all day
It's completely optional, and you can unlock it with 17 years of continuous driving.
"Are you going by the logic ""I could sell you this orange for $10, but I am going to sell it for $5, therefore I am losing $5 of profit""?"
"They make more than one pack.

"I think it was so owner's don't run their battery to empty, which can damage it, and so they can have a ""limp"" mode if their battery gets too low. "
It will probably be like this for another 4 - 6 years. I think the reception of the Demon will be the make-or-break for whether or not the auto-market trusts Chrysler again. 
Very few farm Karma as diligently as /u/gallowboob does, he seems to spend every waking hour scouring the net to provide Reddit with up-vote worthy posts(sometimes not).

Wow, good deal. Do you think I need it?  
Yes, and they sent updates to people in Florida who were evacuating for hurricane Irma.
[deleted]
They make 1 battery bank type and when you pay extra you get more kwh unlocked. Its logical to manufacture only minimum differences in components, all car manufacturers do similar things.
Yeah they made like a 70 kw/h battery and limited the capacity to like 60 kw/h or something like that. Numbers are probably wrong
But most people already discredit them because of those years so their current products are under appreciated
I guess you're right about the features. Really it's just that you're getting a bigger car for the same price and (in my opinion) nearly the same quality. In terms of drive quality, the bmw wins against the majority of cars. 
Like /u/gallowboob karma?
If you don’t know “This is Spinal Tap” you deserve to die in a horrific gardening accident.
They put like 4000 dollars of microtransactions on the new Battlefront.
Bugatti actually does this. There are two keys to the vehicle. From what I remember, you get one key with the car. You have to formally ask Bugatti for permission for the 2nd key, of which if they deem you worthy, they will send it to you to unlock the rest of the horsepower.
"""New! Braking DLC available for the unprecedented discounted price of ~~499.99~~ 499.95!"""

"People who bought bitcoin bought it because it has the potential to achieve a lot of things.

You did need a brain to decide to buy bitcoin because you would have had to understand the technology, otherwise you wouldn't have bought any! Haha."

"[Not anymore](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Ferrari):    
> On 29 October 2014, the FCA group, resulting from the merger between manufacturers Fiat and Chrysler, announced the split of its luxury brand, Ferrari. The aim is to turn Ferrari into an independent brand which 10 percent of stake will be sold in an IPO in 2015.[17] Ferrari officially priced its initial public offering at $52 a share after the market close on 20 October 2015.

"Tesla can't beat me if it's on a tow truck ;)"
Arguably the only true good product they make. Especially for the value. Price of a 328i with twice the features? Don't mind if I do.
