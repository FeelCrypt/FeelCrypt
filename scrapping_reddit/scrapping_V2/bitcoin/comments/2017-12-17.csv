"All of the organizations that ACE recommends (and many others) are doing important work for animals. And they all have different areas of focus. The OP seems to have a strong interest in fundamental research, based on the donations and comments so far. We would be grateful if you would consider Faunalytics, an ACE standout charity and one of the few that are completely dedicated to ""meta"" activities like research and evaluation. We submitted our application two days ago via the form. Thank you, and thanks for your extreme generosity."
