Makes me question, why don’t people just buy like 10 coins each of these super cheap coins?  No harm if you lose it and then it’s nice if it takes off. The CoinCap app lists like 1000 coins.  I don’t see what 85% will ever be used for but they are sill ridiculous cheap.  Shit you could get a ton for a dollar!

good lucking waiting 5 years.
I had my buys all the way down, but main ones were 7500/7700, almost made it! now i can resume skeleton status waiting for next dip.
soo gooey
I just cashed out 401k and bought the cutest cryptokitty!
40k would be about 900 trillion market cap, i concur there will be some major shifts before then.
