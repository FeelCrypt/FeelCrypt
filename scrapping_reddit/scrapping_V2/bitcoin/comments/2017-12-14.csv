"If I create a company today and give out stocks for free, even a 1$ increase to my stock price will equal to a infinity% increase of the price. So all you need to do is take a the right portion of time and you will have a favorable increase. I am pretty sure 10,000$ could buy you 50% of any major tech company worth trillions today.

"The Louisiana purchase was 50 cents an acre (inflation adjusted).

Now the average midwest farm acre is worth (conservatively) $3,020. That's a 604,000% increase.

It took roughly 100 years to fully exploit that purchase.

It will take bitcoin 20 years to fully exploit its use.

"Yeah, my alma mater has been building new dorms. They're nice as hell. Honestly they seem like borderline luxury units.

For example, the old dorms were smaller and had no AC (I went to school in New England, there's no need for AC there, it's a nice-to-have appliance). The new ones all have central AC. Plus the rooms are all larger, bigger windows, nicer furniture, etc.

The same goes with the new academic buildings. They're very flashy, and they look nice, but it seems like they're focusing more on ""how can we get our campus to look nice?"" than ""how can we rein the budget in while still providing a great education?""

Personally I think new student loans should just be dischargable under bankruptcy. Then lenders will stop lending money to people who obviously won't be able to pay it back. With the money stream dried up, universities will have to actually focus on their budgets, instead of engorging them with student loan money."

"My brother. He was always a PC nerd. It's because of him that I knew about lots of things computer related. We both actually learned about bitcoin before we were on Reddit. I'll have to ask him where he first learned about it. 

Looking back, him ranting and raving about people becoming millionaires would have been when BTC peaked around $30usd in July 2011 before falling back down. 

Edit: Due to my general laziness, I never got into Bitcoin until this year even though I planned on investing in it for a few years. "
well i was actually in hong kong at the time and didn't have health insurance there so used the money to fly back to the states where i had health insurance and obviously had to pay a lot of money even with health insurance but not as much as I would have without it in hong kong. Ultimately my fault for not getting health insurance while in hong kong.
Ethereum has grown exponentially more than BTC this year though...
"> I just recently remembered all this after forgetting about it for a while. Feels bad man.

So you're exactly the case I mentioned in my other comment"
Exactly, and many of those milestones represent significant returns on investment. The only people still holding from 5 years ago are the diehards who are in this because they believe in the tech, and people who forgot they bought in.
lol.
If you couldn’t buy fractions, almost nobody would be investing in it at this price. 
Kick me harder, I was there when it was $1 and I bought gold instead because of some stupid article I read online about just a small group of people hording BTC and would some day crash the price.... today that investment is a pittance compared to the $60,000,000 it could have been. FML. 
"It was one of those things where if you had a decent surplus of money you could afford to play around with it and maybe get a few bitcoins (like the Winklevoss twins).If you don't have a ton of money in surplus you would probably much rather do something safe.

Yeah I went an bought ethereum right after I heard the spike. Now it's a bit but if it skyrockets like bitcoin it would be crazy. But it's best to diversify. 
You could still be one. Just buy 2 or 3 Bitcoin. It could reach a million by 2022.

"I wanted to start invest in Bitcoin in early 2015.

My company went bankrupt in March 2015 and I couldn't find a job until September 2017. So needless to say, I don't own any bitcoin.

Betting on additive manufacturing. It's pretty low right now but so many companies have under handedly invested millions. 
Yeah people harping on if they only bought btc when it was $10. Well realistically if you owned 300 btc when it was $10, you would have also sold when it was somewhere around $50 or $100. No rational person would hold it for this long when they saw a 5-10x growth. Most of the people hitting it rich are people who bought and then never bothered to look at btc prices until recently. 
That's horrible advice
set it and forget it, solid investment advice
Bitcoin value investing? 
This is dangerous investing. If all it takes is simply to throw money at small companies then many people would be wealthy. You need to view what you’re doing as playing the lottery. Buying a bunch of lottery tickets would make you rich as long as you hit one right? But most people don’t put much into lottery or at all because the likelihood is so minuscule. It’s a much safer choice to keep putting into your 401k. Crypto and stock market gambling should be a small portion of your investment portfolio.

And the other portion those people are the people who are holding because they firmly believe that bitcoin will be worth much MUCH more in the coming years. 
Mine have increased 50x and I haven't sold any.
Also if everyone held onto it, it would have never reached the price it's at today.
So true. I wanted to buy bitcoin in 2012, but it looked too hard to buy at the time, as I was used to just going in a store to buy gold or silver for investments.... and being handed it right there. Wallets, exchanges, etc were foreign to me. But in truth, I would have sold it when it went up just a little. I know myself 😃 so not too upset. 
[deleted]
I think that the odds are way better than at the lottery, otherwise no rational human being would invest at all in stocks. But you're absolutely right that this is not a safe or reasonable way to save for retirement, it's more like gambling, but with much better odds. That's my thinking about hodling bitcoin. I don't see it as a real investment, but I enjoy the universe around it where you can learn a lot about current technological trends and also you can make bets on the future development of certain software projects aka cryptocurrencies. 
AMZN,MSFT,AAPL,GOOG all made stupid money AFTER their IPOs.

No. You weren’t too poor. It was $100 a bitcoin. You didn’t have the vision back then. If you would have put $20 in you’d have $3,000 now.

"No, because those companies *do things*.

If the company only existed to sell stock, and investors bought in on the idea that they could get other investors to invest in it and then pull out when they feel they've made enough, then you'd see more companies like that. That's essentially what bitcoin is; stock for a company that makes nothing.

"You can sit at a roulette wheel all day and think to yourself ""damn I should have bet the house on 32 Red, I'd be a millionaire now""

Or you can think that you didn't actually know what was going to happen so its stupid to beat yourself up for not taking a risk you had no idea would pay off.

When Bitcoin hit $1200 for the first time it later dropped down to the mid 200s for nearly an entire year. If at some point you needed to spend those bitcoins you would have lost over 80% of what you put in.

you don't hear the stories of people who lost huge amounts of money on bitcoin because people don't tend to brag about their failures.

When the price hit $1k I regretted not investing in it either. But at $1k I decided not to put money in because I didn't think it would go up any further. 

Obviously looking back at it now, it seems like a huge fuckup. But it could have also easily gone the other way and been worthless "

True but, I never considered buying those. I literally got a coinbase wallet and thought about buying one while they were cheaper. The coin base wallet gave me one dollar in bitcoin which is now worth 154. Live and learn but I agree. Don't dwell on decisions not made.
The difference is many people here knew people mining in 2010 and made the conscious decision not to. In retrospect it was huge sums of money for nothing.
"Laziness got me, not a willingness/unwillingness.

I was explained in detail what Bitcoin was, and offered one of the best GPUs at the time to start my own mining for 1/3 the retail price by a coworker.

Eh I did the Tesla thing, it was nothing like this haha
Yeah but you could have made a fortune buying bitcoin earlier this year! Those others were all cheap before I had pubes. 
There was at time around 5 years ago I could have bought bitcoin for 30 cents and now it's $16,700. No other stock in history has compared. Not even close. I sat at a computer and watched a friend do it and he is now a multimillionaire. 
Yup, you only wish that now because you know the outcome.  Bitcoin isn't the only investment that could have paid off between then and now.  There are risky investments to be made today that will pay off but the difference is we don't know which ones.  
My dad tried to buy Apple stock when it was dirt cheap, he was told not to. I told him to buy Tesla stock when it was dirt cheap, he didn't. Last month I bought into various cryto and have made 300% returns because I learned from the mistakes he made.

"That's not a pyramid scheme. A pyramid scheme has a centrally planned cash flow with the leader/leaders controlling money in and out of the scam, and once they determine it is large enough, they run away with everyones funds.

Bitcoin is literally the opposite of a pyramid scheme, everyone who owns BTC controls their own coins, no one can exit scam the Bitcoin network, there is no leader in control. The fiat system is more similar to a pyramid scheme than bitcoin, with central banks that control the money supply."
By that logic, every stock/publicly traded company is a pyramid scheme.

"Yeah, investing with 20/20 hindsight is always profitable (well, I bet some would still lose money)

For the rest, you have to actually have the balls to buy stuff and the money to lose. It's gambling, plain and simple.

The irony is, when they were $5000 they probably thought the same and didn't buy, and then when they were $10000 they thought the same and didn't buy. Now they're around $17000 no doubt they are not going to buy either.

Which means, if they go up, they will still be saying ""Aww...I could have bought some""

Of course, at some point, when they crash down to a few cents each they'll be there ""Phew...I'm glad I didn't buy any"""
I know, but how do you avoid those thoughts, the one you just quoted, it's so hard to not think that way, and I'm sure a lot of people literally get depressed or anxious with those constant thoughts that continue popping into their heads each time they see the current price.

"Going from $15,000 to $1,000,000 is only a 66x increase, compared to going from $0.30 to $15,000 which is a 50,000x increase.

""you could still be a bitcoin millionaire!"" is massively downplaying the fact that the risk reward ratio has shifted by orders of magnitude.

It's impossible for bitcoin to see the same level of rise it already has, and its potential to drop in value is far higher than before.

You're risking far more putting $50,000 in bitcoin now than putting in $500 6 years ago, and you stand to gain a lot less."
you do know that the concept of money is that it is the ONE THING that has no intrinsic value, yet can be exchanged for literally ALL THE THINGS. this, uhm, general token of sorts needs to be rare and unforgeable, and its practical use case as a currency derives from a (perceived) stability, meaning low volatility and a predictable issuance rate. 
Except that it has a very simple rudimentary use. A secure, reliable, immutable, decentralized store of value. That's the maddening part to some, they cannot accept that we trust Bitcoin more than gold and more than our governments. In cryptography we trust.

"I put in *that* money, but wasn't allowed to put the money saved up through years of christmas and birthday money (that was invested in stocks under my dad's control) into it. That was roughly 3500 at <$100 in 2013, whereas I didn't have money from working and put (way less than 3500) in 2014/5. In 2014/5 I had my own bank account and job (he did permiss that, I wasn't 18) and didn't need my dad's permission to use money in it.

Basically, the smaller amount of money I had free(ish) control over, years later, I did (oh, also an insignificant amount of money in 2013) invest. The larger amount of my money years earlier I didn't have control over and my dad didn't allow it despite the pleading of my case."
Bitcoin also has the issue of consuming massive amounts of energy. With every new Bitcoin added to the market miners need use more processing power to mine the next coin. I've read somewhere that Bitcoin miners consume as much energy as Denmark. Those miners are essential to keeping Bitcoin running. In a society were we are much more conscious of our energy consumption, if crytocurrency becomes mainstream Bitcoin is going to have a hard time competing with alt coins that use more energy efficient ways to maintain the blockchain.
"> Please only invest what you are comfortable losing

That is absolutely the plan. I am looking at it no different than gamlbing, just maybe a little better risk/reward than a casino. "
"Bitcoin lost 80% of its value for close to a year after it hit $1200 for the first time. It took several years to get back to $1200. That's a terrible return on investment during those years. You could have sold at $1200, burned half the money, bought back in at $250 and still have made a profit compared to ""hodling"" during that time.

Saying there's never a bad time to buy bitcoin because it tends to go up over time is like saying there's never a bad time to buy a house because house prices have been going up on average for over 100 years.

there was a bad time to buy a house, immediately before the last housing crash. Depending on where you bought your house it might still not have recovered in value, nearly 10 years later.

The fact that eventually the house will probably be worth more than it was in 2006 doesn't mean it was a wise time to buy. Same goes for buying gold right at the peak of the gold bubble. Everyone who bought in at the peak of those bubbles thought it was a sure thing that price was never coming down again, both of them are still down significantly.

"> Except a house is not an investment you put extra money towards

Plenty of people were flipping houses as an investment. Some folks might have been leveraged to the eyeballs but there were plenty of people who were investing with money they could afford to lose.

Everyone who bought a house and then sold it on for even more did great, except for the guys at the very peak of the wave, who couldn't find anyone to pay more than what they paid.

You can never exactly predict when the peak will be, but the higher it goes the more likely it is that you will be the one holding the bag when the market craps out.
"
">If I was so worried about buying and selling at the right times I could've missed the doubling that just happened after thanksgiving

you could also have ended up losing 90% of what you put in. You just said nobody can predict the future. I'm assuming all the people who bought in bitcoin when it hit $1200 didn't predict it would take nearly 4 years to hit that price again, and that if they waited a year they could buy 4x as many bitcoins as they did for the same money.

> Just hold a value you can afford to lose, if you can afford to buy more, do it... that's it.. there's really nothing to it

This is terrible investing advice, you could apply it to literally anything.

You could have said it about gold in 2010. What if gold goes up 10x in the next few months!? Well yeah what if drops significantly and takes decades to recover. Then its not a good idea."
Many people in bitcoin are also ignoring things like exchanges printing fake money based on the value of a bank account that nobody has ever seen, the fact that it's a currency that can no longer reliably be used as an open currency due to transaction fees, limits, and an endless shifting tide of security vulnerabilities, and the fact that it's ultimately a game of Russian roulette where the handful of major holders and mining blocs know which chamber the bullet's in and can pull the trigger for you long before you can react.

"Mining energy use is in direct proportion to mining rewards.  Put another way, if mining produces 1 million in coinbase rewards and transaction fees a day, then energy costs can be calculated as

    1,000,000 - amortized cost of capital - profits = value of energy used

Mining rewards (coinbase rewards) are currently vastly higher than they will be in the future.  The network is bootstrapped with these early rewards, which halve over time.  Eventually, the value of energy used will be in direct proportion to transaction fees.

Another issue is that traditional networks (banks, visa, fiat currency) is far more expensive than many people realize.  It's an industry that employs hundreds of thousands of people globally, with enormous energy expenditure.  I think it's ultimately foolish to compare the two because it's so difficult to estimate with accuracy, but this should not be overlooked.

Finally, there are some fun market dynamics that come out of Bitcoin mining.  Bitcoin can be mined anywhere, and thus take advantage of cheap electricity.  Energy infrastructure is often inelastic; a wind or solar plant has fixed capital and operational costs.  If you have 10MW of demand now, but expect 30MW of demand in 20 years, you build a 30MW plant.  So how do you make up the difference?  You sell electricity for less, and some goes to waste.  Bitcoin provides demand for electricity in these remote areas, making these infrastructure projects pay off more quickly, and thus can incentive green energy projects.  This is absolutely happening in China.  To what degree is very difficult to say, but it's noteworthy that production and demand will never be in perfect alignment.  If Bitcoin can serve as arbitrage, it is very much in line with sustainable energy development.

_______

The other aspect is that any cryptocurrency that is based on proof-of-work is going to have security in *exact* proportion to energy use.  The cost of an attack will always be directly proportional to the value of securing the network, i.e. mining rewards.  It doesn't matter if it's Bitcoin or Ethereum or whatever.  The only way this could change is a proof-of-stake system.  Such a system may be developed, but it is *far* from clear that it can be done."

Except a house is not an investment you put extra money towards.. if Bitcoin goes down then yeah I lost the max potential of magic internet money, but at the rate it has been growing I think its financially irresponsible not to diversify into it at this point 
Lmao the reason people say this is because nobody can predict the future. Many, MANY prominent people in bitcoin are saying the price could 10X in just the next few months. If I was so worried about buying and selling at the right times I could've missed the doubling that just happened after thanksgiving. Just hold a value you can afford to lose, if you can afford to buy more, do it... that's it.. there's really nothing to it.

"> That would make sense if you had a whitepaper clearly outlining how 32 Red would be a superior choice with a clearly favorable risk/reward profile.

Plenty of gamblers say they have a winning system. Some even write them into books. If you ask the winning roulette wheel players what their system is you won't get any better answer than if you ask the losers. The fact they won is not proof they had a winning system. It's just survivor bias. 

The white paper is a bad example of a prediction, since Satoshi intended bitcoin to scale properly and to be used as a peer-to-peer currency, not to fail to scale and become a ~~speculative investment~~ ""store of value"".

The words ""store of value"" don't appear once in the original white paper, neither do ""settlement layer"" or ""second layer solution"". All those things have since come about as explanations for why bitcoin is still valuable and not a speculative bubble even though its failing to do the things Satoshi intended and predicted it would do.

There's plenty of other coins with white papers that all claim it can be the currency of the future. Are all of those right? How do you know which ones are right and which ones aren't? By waiting to see which ones win?"

"Bitcoin does ""do things"" and will do more, there was a time before all the recent hype and increased valuation that it was obvious that everyone was here for the fundamentals: A currency not controlled by goverments or organisations, a unit of value that can't be faked or forged, is not based on debt and manipulated through inflation, is the digital future of money. You look at the graph and you see a ponzi, but bitcoin always had to go through this phase on the way to adoption. You may or may not be happy with 3-5 days SEPA transactions, taxpayers bailing out failed banks, billions of unbanked people across the world. But this is what *we* believe bitcoin can fix, these are the fundamentals that brought the original community together. These are the *things* that bitcoin will do. Do you really believe in your shares or a futures contracts you may hold in the same way? What were you going to do with them apart from sell them, what can you do with them?"

Ahhhh okay I gotcha. Makes sense 
"I actually did study something somewhat related in 2010 and I probably would have heard of it if I had been lurking on reddit but I was busy building a business. The business was generating a lot of cashflow, knowing me I probably would have put in a lot back in the day but yea I hadn't heard about it until 2012. Then in 2012 I invested a small amount and the exchange went bankrupt. I got my money back but then decided to invest in LTC instead. I remember how sketchy all this was. Then in 2014 I discovered ETH and it all made sense to me suddenly and what a big breakthrough this would be... 

Anyway there are still tremendous opportunities ahead! Even mining opportunities like Filecoin or others. This will be a huge industry one day (no right now it isn't and in my opinion we are nearing ""peak inflated expectations"")"
Ouch. That sucked, man.
"What do you mean ""though""? Yes, I've had even greater returns. If I was allowed to invest my money I'd be a millionaire."

"Even now not many people know what the fuck Bitcoin is doing or where it’s going. I think the only people that do are 1.) Russian Intel workers 2.) Chinese Intel workers 3.) CIA

"if you mean ""knew"" as in 100% positive it would get this popular, yeah sure nobody can tell the future but that's being pedantic. Plenty of people realized that this was the start of something and that this type of currency, if not specifically bitcoin, would become popular"
I'm researching what to buy and how to buy it right now. My GF and I talked about it last night and we are investing in digital currency. I have a personal theory that there will be 3 main forms of digital currency when it is all said and done. Huge things always end up in 3's. I think bitcoin and ethereum have all but secured the top 2 spots, and now I'd like to try and find the next bitcoin in #3. We're ok enough that I'm not trying to slowly grow an investment portfolio through digital currency. I'm just trying to find the next one with skyrocketing growth. It could still be bitcoin going to 200,000k, I know that, and please don't take any of this as anything but random guesses. I have no clue what I'm really talking about. 
"Or it could not. Price multiplied so many times that now it's just a gamble. Not like you throw in few hundreds, let's say even thousands and what happens, happens. 

Now people persuade others to invest and spend tens of thousands. People are selling cars, houses, everything they have some value to invest in bitcoin while it's 16k. 

This is not investment, this is gambling."
"That’s the big one for me. I could’ve mined with my 1070 up till like January and would’ve made a pretty penny. But I was like “nah, it’ll burn out the card”

Edit: okay, couldn’t have mined on a 1070.  Makes me feel slightly better about being me ;) tbh I stopped looking into it after I decided I didn’t want to reduce my shiny GPU’s lifespan. "
That's still an awesome profit.

"You could have never mined Bitcoin with a 1070, but you can still mine alts for $2-3 a day with that card.

What's stopping you now?"
"> Anyway there are still tremendous opportunities ahead! 

Absolutely. I may have missed the ""get rich off of $100,"" but that doesn't mean I can't invest in it still. ETH and LTC have doubled in price this past week and it's not impossible that they'll close the price gap between them and BTC, currently worth .042BTC and .017BTC respectively. Then there's Ripple, which has tripled to $0.80USD in the past week. I need to invest a couple hundred or so in that just in case it shoots up in price. Most of my coins will still be held in BTC since I feel it's still the safest option and is the pioneer coin. 

>This will be a huge industry one day (no right now it isn't and in my opinion we are nearing ""peak inflated expectations"")

I agree. Cryptocurrency is nowhere near what it will be. Although Bitcoin has a special place, I don't believe it can exist as the sole currency of the world due to limited supply and divisibility ([see another comment of mine here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7h6fft/as_of_right_now_the_24hr_high_is_11100usd_and_the/dqovugq/)). Basically BTC market cap would be to small to meet the worlds demand, or one Satoshi would equal more than 1¢. Either way, BTC would have to be supplemented with another currency. 

P.S. While typing this, I had the thought of the US issuing dollar bills that say [""one dollar in Bitcoin payable to the bearer on demand""](https://www.collectons.com//images/items/2013/03/05/1362527682.jpg)"

Btc isn't out of the woods just yet, the fees are expensive and slow and it's not consumer friendly. Until these are fixed, a few nerdy investors will keep hodling and it won't reach the moon.
"> I have no clue what I'm really talking about. 

Please only invest what you are comfortable losing. Digital currencies are closer to gambling than investing. "
People say this, and I won't agree or disagree, all I know is mathematically speaking if you had this conversation a month ago and put $50,000 into bitcoin you'd see over a 100% return. To think that if you invested something today that it would cosmically be the day when bitcoin falls and never recovers would be an enormous coincidence. 
"You're right, it wasn't even at $50 when it was regularly stated in forums etc that it will go to 0 or 100k+..  I think most who haven't yet reached their goal would still be holding unless they really needed the money along the way. 

On the plus side, imagine how salty the 21 btc owners will be if it tanks now, lots of stories of.. could have bought a house but needed it just a little higher to retire."
Fuck it dude. Nobody could have predicted this. It's of literally NO use to feel bad over something that never happened.

"Yup. There was a story while back on reddit about a guy who committed suicide and Bitcoin was probable reason why.

I though about if I'd bought, say, 4000 bitcoins for 30 cents each, I'd like to think I'd sold 1000 for $5 each, 1000
At $100 each, 1000 at $1000 each, 950 at $10000 each and rest to just see how far it'd go.

I might not have done this but at least there is logic (you get your investment back, and you still get decent return if Bitcoin never made it past $100.

">I think that the odds are way better than at the lottery, otherwise no rational human being would invest at all in stocks

Putting your money in blue chips is very different from buying small-cap companies in the hopes that they'll experience dramatic growth.

Buying small-caps is much riskier and the odds are against you."

Gold and Bitcoin could both be currencies. They both are already stores of value, they would just need to become units of account, accepted means of exchange (which might be happening with Bitcoin, seeing as how the top player on the team will be payed in it!), and it would need to be the standard of deferred payment. Bitcoin acts as a store of value as you and I said, and if it starts getting used more as a means of exchange, it would be a slow process, but it could eventually start getting used as a unit of account, and from there become a standard of deferred payment. All I'm saying is that if it already acts as one, that could lead to the others.

In 2014 it spiked to about 700. But yes true I didn't have the vision because I thought it would go back down.
Everyone saying they wished they had bought in probably wouldn't have held long enough to have a substantial sum anyway. That includes me, who sold 120btc to buy a car and boat. I regret selling but there's no way I would have held through to this price.
I can confirm the “you would have sold already”, because that’s exactly what I did. Bought in at $1, sold at $40, made a nice little profit. No regrets though, nobody could have predicted the insanity of the last year back then.

A rising tide lifts all ships, and converting BTC to Marketing (via fiat) _is an investment_. It's also the perfect opportunity because there is the awareness of digital currency has hit the mainstream. Top Hodlers should seize that opportunity."

The Minnesota dream
The best thing. There was a DIP where coins were down to sub-$200 wayy after the $1180 ATH peak of 2013.
There was one point you could have bought Apple, Amazon, Tesla or any other stock dirt cheap. Hindsight is 20/20.
"You could have never known. I had a mate who we convinced to buy a shit ton of bit coin under a dollar because he got inheritance money from an uncle and we thought we were funny one night playing csgo

Pretty sure he still has some,  we lost touch when he sold a bunch and moved to eu.

He never thought out would get high,  we never did, no one knew. Don't feel bad,  these people are just extra lucky. Like my friend"
The British Pound Pitch
It's funny cause back then I told my self $100-300 a Bitcoin was too expensive but now knowing what they are going for $100-200 was a steal
I sold at $100... mined them when bitcoin was worth around $10 each. Unfortunately I had an injury and had no money to cover medical expenses so sold my bitcoin to pay for the costs.

Yeah, and I wish I had known the lottery numbers before they came out. People have been doing this for years, don't beat yourself up about it. 
"You would've sold at 300-400 like everybody else. Or dumped it when it dipped. These ""I wish I'd bought in X years ago"" posts in this sub make no sense to me."
"this thing is only just starting.

Articles like this make me hate myself for selling at $20. 
You would have sold them once the price went up to $1200,- the first time anyway. 
It's barely a currency. It's like commodities trading at this point in time.

my friends told me to buy it but upon founding how hard it was at that time, i was to lazy and didn't to do it. Could have been a millionaire
I'm friends with him. He's a billionaire in Danish currency not US dollars or Euros (as for now). 
You kidding? I knew about it when it was under $1.  My brother was all excited about it but I was to lazy to buy some. Too late to retire off of $100 now though. 
I did, but only so little... :'(
Unlikely, but you'll definitely get profit. 
"Yeah? Back when bitcoin was first being mumbled about and was still a few under a dollar I wrote a paper for school about how bitcoin was going to SKYROCKET to $10 or even $20 because I saw them as a digital currency that could be used for digital items like say you were REALLY good a WOW and had a lot of cool items, you could sell them for Bitcoin and use that to buy items in a completely different game. I had a friend who bought $50 in bitcoin and asked my mother if she could help me buy $20 if my friend shown me how to do it. She said no.

I have two friends who invested early, one bought 2500 for almost nothing and sold it all for $4000 when he wanted a newer car. another had a few hundred and sold them at $10 I believe"
Litecoin is only $200. You'll be saying the same exact thing if litcoin made it big too.
What sucks was I was mining and playing around with BTC back when it was $10 a coin before it ever it $100 and crashed. Somewhere out there I think I have 2 still, gotta dig up some old hard drives...
The thing that annoys me is I tried to at that price but the website I tried to use never verified my identity so I just decided it wasn't worth it.
The 95+% of the money is used to help patients, free of charge, and to fun research. The rest is kept as security if donations run thin. 
Thanks for your work! I have made some contributions in the past, and intent to make a great many more once my Maslowian needs are sorted out. Hopefully not just Pineapple Fund but also other nouveau riche bitcoiners can help you close the funding gap!
Thanks, must habe overlooked it.  I'm better with pie charts than words
Absolutely :)
"St Judes has tons of money (over 1 Billion ) and very few inpatient beds. There are hospitals struggling to keep their doors open.

Seconded"
"> Maybe MIRI. They just do research to help keep future AI safe. They accept Bitcoin. https://intelligence.org/

This. There's a lot of effort being put into making machines that do what we *tell* them to do, but very little effort put into making machines that do what we *want* them to do.

As AI advances, I think we'll find that the second problem becomes much more important. For example, imagine an AI smart enough to do really well at biomedical research and tasked with reducing the incidence of cancer. It comes up with a bio-molecule that's pretty good at preventing cancer in people, but then it turns out that the molecule also causes those who receive to become allergic to alcohol. The AI had figured out that stopping people from drinking would reduce their risk of cancer, so it forced people to stop.

That specific failure mode was so unexpected that the AI's creators didn't think to address it, but a properly designed AI should respect our preferences, even if we don't think to explicitly tell the AI to respect a given preference. MIRI is working to figure out how to build AIs in such a way that they do what we want, without us having to perfectly convey our desires to them."
Ya we need these guys around.
"OMG What an incredible act of generosity! I would like to ask you to donate 80 Bitcoin to [https://de.serlo.org/](https://de.serlo.org/) I have been lucky to meet the founders a couple of times and I myself are an annual donor for Serlo. The hard voluntary work to educate young children and bring them out of poverty that they have been doing since their beginning in 2009 is by far the most amazing voluntary work that I have seen in Germany over the past years. 

You are probably curious how it would help them and what exactly Serlo is doing to help so many children.

Before I answer that I would ask you to think about what made you so wealthy? 

Of course you might say:  ""*It was bitcoin and my involvement within the bitcoin community/movement*."" Maybe you have been a developer at bitcoin-core or maybe just an early miner or an early investor. Maybe u have been the person buying [two Pizza for Laszlo and receiving 10’000 bitcoin in return](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=137.0). 

Obviously I don’t know what your role was and how you happened to have more than 5k Bitcoin to donate. However I am very confident that I do know the following: 

If you didn’t have a strong educational background and good access to information you would probably not have been involved with bitcoin and would not have been able to create the pineapple fund. 

Boiling that down I hope that you realize: 

**Education changes everything and enables human beings to lead a self-determined life with dignity.**

But even in a highly developed country like Germany (where schools and universities are basically free of charge) we unfortunately must realize that [wealth and access to education is poorly distributed](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/nicolas-berggruen/germany-wealth-distribution_b_5625540.html). Children coming from financially weak families or from families in which the parents do not have a university degree are (not only in Germany) [less likely to achieve a good education themselves](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2853053/). Statistically they are more likely to die at younger ages and will most likely never be able to live a self-determined life in the way as you and I will be able to do. I personally think this is outrageous. 

Over the last 8 years Serlo has tried to fight this injustice by all means. Following [the footprints of Aaron Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz) who not only found the Reddit Website but also [wrote the guerilla open access manifesto](https://archive.org/stream/GuerillaOpenAccessManifesto/Goamjuly2008_djvu.txt). In his manifesto he describes the moral imperative to free all knowledge from copyright protection in order to have our civilization based upon knowledge. 

In my personal opinion serlo already goes one step further than Aaron. Freeing knowledge is obviously a noble goal. But the next logical step is not only to create an encyclopedia or database of freely accessible and openly licensed knowledge like the Wikipedia but to create a platform and community of people that help other people and in particular children to learn from our fortune of freed knowledge and educate themselves. **This is exactly what Serlo does. With an amazing voluntary effort of many students Serlo provides educational content in the form of thousands of articles, exercises, pictures and videos for students of all ages which currently hundreds of thousands of students use every month.** 

After another person on Reddit said [(s)he would donate one Bitcoin every day until Christmas for Charity](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7gpe1q/give_bitcoin_this_christmas_ill_start_with_25/?st=jb6iq28d&sh=08b683aa) and after your post, I - who is a PhD Student in Web Science, watching the cryptocurrency movement for the last 5 years and [created many openly licensed teaching materials](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/User:Renepick) - convinced the people from Serlo to accept donations via bitcoin since this very morning. C.f.: [https://de.serlo.org/spenden](https://de.serlo.org/spenden) (at the very bottom of the page) and I think they are also planning to formally hand in an application on your website. 

Again you can become witness of the terrible injustice in this world. It is my strong educational background and access to knowledge enabling me to ask you for the donation. In that sense I think it is even clearer why Serlo.org is such an important plattform.

Even if you decide against donating to serlo: Thanks a lot for your noble charity. It is amazing to see that people like you who have been lucky to get a fortune of money are willing to share it for a good cause. There are obviously many other institutions around the globe that do work that is as important or as charitable as the work of serlo. In that sense it is even hard for me to suggest Serlo who might then possibly receive BTC from you which others won’t receive. However if you would consider Serlo I am very sure it would help millions of children in Germany and eventually around the globe a lot.

By the Way Serlo is very similar to Khan Academy but does not have big donors. Also it has this touch of Wikipedia and Community editing and auditing the site. Serlo has always been struggling to survive on very small funds even though the site is well known in Germany and [won many awards](https://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Serlo&oldid=169554187#Auszeichnungen). In that sense I am sure they know how to manage money and to spend it extremely effective, efficient and wisely. 

Thanks for reading up to here. With kind regards Rene Pickhardt"
"Also may I suggest donating to Wikipedia donation fund?

"Wikipedia is an almost-finished project though. It has made an enormous difference to the world but it could now be scaled back considerably, most of the articles have been written, it's already changed our culture, and it is cash rich and rather inefficient.

Its information fits on my laptop hard drive. It might serve 50 thousand hits per second but it shouldn't need 300 servers or cost 80 million dollars a year to run. And I know Wikimedia do other things, but it's mostly just Wikipedia that people need."
"This post made my day. Very cool!

I'd encourage you to consider the Against Malaria Foundation. It horrifies me to realize there are parents who can't afford a $4 bednet to protect their children from a life-threatening disease. I can't imagine having a child and not being able to keep him or her safe.

Malaria still kills nearly a million children every year, but it is VERY preventable. The Gateses are also working on eradicating malaria because it's such an effective way of improving lives for those worst off. And a lot of governments have partnered with AMF, so your dollars will go twice as far!

According to GiveWell charity evaluators, you can save a life for $3500 with bednets. They also say that the Against Malaria Foundation will fall $50 million short of their funding target just this year. If you made up that gap, you would singlehandedly save the lives of more than 14,000 people - and you'd have 14,000 very grateful families thanking you.

"My wife has late stage colon cancer. It's been an extremely long fight, approaching 5 years now. But the doctors have recently told us she only has a few months left. It's too bad it often takes a tragedy to bring attention to such charities. I never gave much thought to cancer research when I was younger.

I'm also a big fan of the *V Foundation*. I too found them when I went looking for a foundation that gives 100% to cancer research. And, while I know it's not a lot of money, I use the *V Foundation* as my charity of choice for Humble Bundles. Maybe, for visibility, you could edit this link into your post:

"There's potentially far more lives-saved per dollar available when you account for existential risk. Pretty much, if humanity goes extinct, that isn't just a loss of everyone on earth, it's also a loss of far more future lives that never come into existence. A 5% chance of saving 10^10 lives (earth population) with, oh, 100 million dollars comes out to about 5 lives saved per dollar, or >1000x more effective than givewell charities in expected value.

One of the leading existential risks is AI risk (here's a bit about it http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/05/22/ai-researchers-on-ai-risk/, the basic argument is that the rest of humanity is rushing forward to human-level or stronger AI, and there's a doom-by-default thing going on where almost all goal systems you could program an AI with fail catastrophically when it gets to human-level or higher, and we don't know what sort of goal system would actually lead a stronger-than-human AI to learn and act on human values, and almost nobody is researching it)

It currently seems like the highest-value use of money on earth at the moment, and the donation link for the MIRI winter fundraiser is https://intelligence.org/donate/ .

Support the idea of doing careful charity/investment research with people who've thought a lot about donating effectively. Others here have recommended GiveWell: Certainly at amounts of money like yours it's worth contacting  *donations@givewell.org* and you'll get a chat with their CEO I'm sure. GiveWell are very thoughtful people and they've said in the past that larger donors can hope to have even more transformative impact than by giving to their top recommendations. As they cooperate with mega-donors they have advice on how to do so.
Yes! I'm so glad somebody mentioned this. I've emailed one of the most well regarded charities in the hope that they will fill out the form :)

Incredibly generous to think of donating such a lot of money - I hope the kind donor will consider giving to this disease, where it would be possible to make such a difference. Thanks to the OP for suggesting the OMF."
ME/CFS is incredibly underfunded for how many people that it impacts (1-2 million in the US), and how severely it impacts them, preventing about 75% from working. Compared to similar conditions in numbers and severity, it receives at least 20-50 times less funding. So contributing to research for it is pretty worthwhile.

"Hi /u/PineappleFund !

I actually don't have a charity to recommend (well I do, but they're filling out an application on their own, and I'm not here to talk about that.)

I want to talk to you about Bitcoin safety. Presumably you haven't gotten this far without thinking about security, but I want to suggest that making grants from a single huge output like this is NOT a good idea, and is potentially dangerous.

Each time you transact, the entire $80 million balance is being moved from one address to another. Every single such move comes with a risk -- not a large one, and not one that would be worth worrying about for a much smaller amount -- of a software bug, hardware failure, cosmic ray, etc. -- rendering the remaining amount lost and unspendable (or not easily spendable.)

Although it's fun and useful to be able to demonstrate ownership of the funds in a single giant output, I think you would be much safer with these funds stored in smaller quantities in separate addresses. I would be happy to provide specific advice on how to do this safely; the easiest procedure would be to make a second wallet and send the funds there in slightly smaller increments, say 500-1000 BTC, such that losing one of them to a software bug would be, although horrifying, at least not the end of the Pineapple Fund. Then you could more safely make your individual donations from the second wallet.

I also hope you are taking due care in storing the funds in general (although I imagine you must at least be using offline storage to have made it this far with so much Bitcoin still in one piece.) On the off chance that you require _any_ advice or consultation on the secure storage or safe handling of Bitcoin, please feel free to reach out. PM here is fine, or gwillen@nerdnet.org , or gwillen@blockstream.com . Anything I can't answer, I have access to people who can, and would not hesitate to help."

"PineappleFund, 
I just signed onto Reddit for the first time today at 11:30 pm and my inbox has blown up with private messages and tags asking me to tell you my story, and about the initiative I founded. Once I started reading this post I got SO STOKED!!! I literally had chills... I was given 5.2 bitcoin by my buddy Joe Rogan and some of his generous podcast community several years back as a sort of science experiment. I think what spurred it all was that Joe had just had Andreas Antonopoulos on the podcast and I was on talking about the cause a few days or weeks later before I left to the eastern Congo rainforest to live for a year... For bitcoin to go from a few thousand dollars to almost six figures is SO INCREDIBLE! The purpose of the BTC donation was to help my foundation make a real & practical impact with the hunter-gatherer Mbuti Pygmy tribe in the rainforest of DRC Congo, my second family. Hearing about BTC exploding last week while I was on the JRE podcast with Joe BLEW MY MIND! I'm blown away by your generosity and how you are living your life to make a difference! AND CREATING THE PINEAPPLE FUND!! 
Here is a quick cliff notes version of who I am and what life I'm so grateful to be living. Someone from reddit made this info meme... http://dailypicdump.com/media/20160629/good-guy-justin-wren.jpg
Also, this community, Reddit, was one of the key components of me starting up Fight for the Forgotten! I'm very thankful for the people who make up this place! A video of me was posted and it became the top post on reddit's homepage for a day. The video was of some of the kids in Congo seeing a dude with white skin for the first time. Jimmy Kimmel showed it that night saying, ""here is Justin Wren, UFC fighter, in Africa being pet like a golden retriever (lol)"" The next day it was on The Today Show, then I was on TMZ for a live interview right after Lindsay Lohan and right before Honey Boo-boo, ha! So I know the power of both Reddit and BTC. (And most of all, COMMUNITY!)  
My name is Justin Wren, I'm a professional MMA fighter, an author, speaker, and founder of the non-profit initiative www.fightfortheforgotten.org that is now under the nonprofit Water4. I founded FFTF after having a rude awakening to the worlds water crisis and modern-day slavery at the same time. I held a 1 & 1/2 year old boy in my hands as his past away, his name was Andibo, and he died of dirty water. As I was digging his grave with blisters on my hands I found out his mother, a slave, was rejected hospital treatment because the hospital wouldn't ""waste their medicine on a Pygmy animal."" The pills were $1 to save his life. It was $3 for the one-shot cure. The entire village tried to give them more than enough but because they were Pygmies they were denied and rejected hospital treatment. It was around $35 for the casket and shovel we buried him with. 
This event changed my life drastically. I've now set out on a mission to defend the weak, love the unloved, and empower the voiceless with a vision of overcoming oppression with overwhelming OPPORTUNITY. The Pygmies told me everyone else calls them the forest people, but they call themselves the forgotten people. That's what I'm now trying to do with my life, Fight for the Forgotten. To live to LOVE, and fight FOR people. The story is better told in person or thru video, but here are some of the things we have accomplished. We have 32 staff in Congo. 20 full time, 12 part-time. They themselves have acquired back 3,000 acres of land for the Mbuti Pygmies, legally. They have drilled over 70 water wells now and started 3 amazing farms. We have replanted over 4,000 trees, and we have seen over 1,500 people literally transition out of modern-day slavery and into sustainable freedom with their own land, water, and food initiatives. We are now currently acquiring more land to start up our own soap production facility and essential oil press so that we can create more jobs, and provide the locals with a safe alternative that is locally sourced instead of the only thing they currently have available, if anything at all, car-washing soap PACKED with toxic chemicals from India or China.  
The nonprofit I partnered with is an amazing non-profit Water4. Last year alone they empowered 44 well drilling businesses in 16 African nations that employed 396 of their fellow countrymen! They are the HEROES of this story! They came together and drilled 690 water wells, JUST LAST YEAR serving over 172,000 of their fellow countrymen. 
Our collective belief is that opportunity is greater than charity. That charity can be great, in specific circumstances, but opportunity is just always better. It's the difference between a one-time handout and a true hand-up. I think the traditional charity model should be reserved and implemented in times of natrual disasters, war, faminine, or people with disabilities, etc... But people facing poverty and problems with a solution need an empowering way out, not a disempowering model that can cripple the community. (check out When Helping Hurts and the documentary Poverty Inc. for quick resources) I learned this by living with the people, listening to them, and learning from them the best way to love them. Help partner with them to create an opportunity. That creates hope, gives energy, and provides a real solution. A Swahili proverb my Mbuti Pygmy family taught me and lived out in front of me is, ""If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together."" Our methodology is all about empowerment! Empowering people with an education, or the knowledge, and equipping them with the tools to solve their own problems locally, and empowering them to carry it out and become SELF-sustaining (not only ""sustainable"" in the western terms) to where they don't become dependent on us, but know they can knockout the water crisis for themselves. 
Here are some quick links of the story that is unfolding. But before I post them, I just want to say thank you for letting me share my story! Also, and more than that, thank you for sharing the incredible OPPORTUNITY you have to empower people to empower people!

Here is the video Reddit made to go viral! I love this place. It's just a cute video, but we used it to parlay that into something tangible and a real impact. It's got about 2 million views because of this place. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ide5YjD6AhI
24 minutes and 10 seconds into this video was my last appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast last week and he SHOCKS me about telling me how much the bitcoin is worth now! https://youtu.be/tk2jKc2U2Z0?t=24m10s
Here is an incredible story of transformation from my good friend Chief Liome talking about the change that has taken place in his village. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz813MmK9fs
Here is a short film that is now turning into a documentary trailer for a feature length film that has been filmed over the last 4 years to give the Pygmies a voice. https://vimeo.com/109140545

Another parent here of a bedbound CFS/ME sufferer.  He's 36 and has been ill for 4 years after contracting a virus.  He lost his job, his marriage and is now living with us- his 70 year old parents.  These patients want to return to a normal life and go to work and would be THRILLED to be able to pay taxes and be self supporting again.
I thought Canada's student loan discharge system actually let people discharge their loans if they became disabled (unlike in the US)? I had no idea that there was no general disability payment, that's insane.  
"/u/PineappleFund - Extremely humbled by your philanthropic approach!  Looks like you’re inundated with suggestions but just wanted to thank you in advance for considering **Ubuntu Pathways** – www.ubuntupathways.org.  We aim to break the cycle of poverty by providing South Africa's orphaned, abused, and most vulnerable children with cradle to career support. I submitted our application earlier today and sent an email too, so hopefully it’s reached you safely! 

In the meantime, just wanted to add that South Africa is known for its baby pineapples, so perhaps on fruit preferences alone The Pineapple Fund and Ubuntu could be a perfect fit :) 
 
Thanks so much!"
"I'm really thankful that you're funding SENS- I think it's so important to help not only problems today, but head them off in the future. 

As they say, 'an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure'. SENS is a really solid charity because the therapies they create could one day make it so that we don't need to study and solve 20 different age-related degenerations; instead, we prevent them from happening to begin with. "
Hey! I work at a great nonprofit in San Rafael, CA called Next Generation Scholars, https://www.nextgenerationscholars.org/. We help low-income students get to college. 100% of our students have enrolled in 4-year colleges and 99% have graduated. We're trying to grow and would love your help!!
Your generosity is awesome! One charity I support is the UK [Humane Slaughter Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humane_Slaughter_Association), which does research on less painful methods of killing animals for food. I think their work is especially important in the case of fish, since most fish that humans harvest are asphyxiated to death with no prior stunning. At least 1 trillion fish are killed per year for food (which is more than 100 times the human population), so the potential impact of reductions in the painfulness of fish slaughter is staggering.
Available only in the USA, as far as I know.
"Thank you for getting this to my attention, I too, have donated bitcoin to GiveDirectly charity https://www.coinbase.com/orders/41f9ee775724867baa7a7d4f007fe365/receipt

I'm a late-getter but i do see the appeal of Bitcoin. I do not have much of it, but I've donated what I can."
Also: THEY ACCEPT BITCOIN
"Wow... Thank you (a million times)

Once an alternate universe a long long time ago I was (periferally)  involved in psychedelic research. Although I felt the work was important funding was always incredibly difficult as even the topic was taboo then. 

I really hope that your million dollars pays dividends in bringing peace to people's lives — a wave of good will flowing forward through time touching humanity in ways we have yet to imagine.

I am deeply moved... I'm going to bed now. Once again thank you... 



^goes ^to ^bed.

Bedtime thought: Someone should give u/PineappleFund a million dollars because of his/her generosity. Wait... wait... something's wrong here : )"
Thank you! MDMA therapy saved/changed my life! I wouldn't be here without their studies. 
We did it!  They're going to donate a million dollars. 
That's amazing! Definitely will keep my eye out for TalkLife.
Even if it's patented the patent will only last for 25 years won't it? Then it's generic and our children and grandchildren get it for free.
We'll donate $1 million to MAPS. Thanks for the recommendation!
"The Future of Humanity Institute, based at the University of Oxford, researches ways to prevent humanity from being wiped out and ensure that future generations can have the best lives possible.

The Earth can potentially remain inhabitable for a further 600-800 million years, during which time a possible 7 million future generations of humans could live. Therefore, their wellbeing is deeply important. FHI research some of the biggest issues that could face humanity in the future, and what we can do about them.

Alternatively:
New Harvest is an organisation that invests in and promotes the creation of clean (i.e. cultured) meat. This is also a very good charitable cause, as currently 60 billion nonhuman animals are slaughtered every year and most are kept in brutal factory farm conditions their entire lives.
New Harvest's aim of bringing to market viable, competitive alternatives to meat could therefore reduce tons of suffering.

I would suggest MSF Doctors without borders. I've worked in the humanitarian field for several years and can vouch for the work that they do. I donate to them every month based on what I saw while in the field. If you want other info on which Humanitarian NGOs to look at would be happy to help.

"I know The Geek Group National Science Institute (http://thegeekgroup.org) would be absolutely THRILLED to receive a donation of any size, ESPECIALLY in Bitcoin.

Founded in 1994, it's was, and is, the original ""makerspace"". They were a makerspace before anyone knew what one was. It's seen it's ups and downs over the years, being shuttled from building to building as they grew and developed. Still holding the title as the world's largest non-profit makerspace, they seek to provide a space where anyone with a sincere and passionate desire to learn can do so, at their own pace, in their own way. Operating on a shoestring budget from day one, TGG has shown time and again that if you are patient, and determined, you can make anything happen on a low budget. The 3 separate live internet TV streams are built with leftover TV station cast offs, and maintained with volunteer labor, and anyone who wants to learn how the equipment works and is used. The worlds largest, public high voltage and high energy labs are likewise built using donations of castoffs, time and love. Other facilities in the building at present are a fully featured vehicle service bay, complete with hoist; a laser lab for experimenting with optics and other such toys; a computer lab for tinkering with computers and software. 

The list goes on, but the common denominator is that all the toys and facilities are available for the average joe to come play with, and learn about. 

But this isn't about just the facility, it's about community too. Situated in the heart of the Grand Rapids, MI ""Westside"" TGG has a heart for the working class people who live around them, and exists to provide them and anyone else a place where they can better themselves. Their Computers for Families program takes cast off, out of warranty computers from offices all over the state, wipes them, refurbishes them, and sells them for a pittance ($50 or less in many cases, just enough to cover costs) or outright gives them away to families all over the area, allowing kids to continue homework at home, parents to do remote schooling, and fill out online paperwork. TGG cares deeply about everyone and want to see everyone succeed, and all their programs are designed around this goal. 

I've been following them from 2011-2012, been a remote member from 2013, been a major donor since 2014, and have been remote staff since the start of 2017.
I am a personal friend of several of the staff and know many others, and the drive to see this company succeed, and to help our fellow mankind become the best versions of themselves they can be is infectious, and apparent in all of us.

It's incredible what we can do with just muscles and drive; I look forwards to the day I can see some real money added to this equasion. 
I really want to stress that it's not about money. We're charging a mere $20/mo for membership ($30 for a family) that has full priviledges when the likes of TechShop were charging $150/mo just to be allowed in the door. We need funding for basic infrastructure, and to pay our hardworking volunteers a respectable wage. We're rated Guidestar Platinum for transparency and accountibility, and we work incredibly heard to maintain that. (https://www.guidestar.org/profile/38-3600686)

To get an idea of what we can do with what we have, check out ""The Geek Group"" on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCM8Y_V0jqqYS6dLwMoRO9FQ)

Please consider this organization in your charitable giving, the impact would be nigh incalculable.

"
"Every consider ""buying"" politicians that will then be swayed to support noble causes?  With that much money, you could influence who becomes the next president, perhaps."
That's incredible. You're incredible. Please consider supporting an environmental group such as [The Sierra Club](https://www.charitywatch.org/ratingsandmetrics.php?charity_id=277) or [American Rivers](https://www.charitywatch.org/ratingsandmetrics.php?charity_id=242). Our environment is our greatest resource and we need to preserve the earth for our future generations. 
It seems callous but, please no. It's not that homelessness and mental illness aren't huge important problems. Just don't feel like you need to help those people locally. Just help wherever you can best. No point focusing on local when more good can be done for the same cost elsewhere.
Thirded. I have me/cfs and dont have enough mental capacity to say much more but my life is hell. I used to be in college on a full ride plus stipend and now I lay in bed most of the day and cannot even focus on movies or books. My life is hell. Also check out this video - youtu.be/Ag3V6Kqo8X8. It really highlights the funding situation. Finally, this disease is probably the worst disease to have(worse than cancer, MS, etc). See https://www.healthrising.org/blog/2015/08/05/chronic-fatigue-syndrome-worse-mulitple-sclerosis-cancer/.
may i suggest adding a zero to that donation? considering you gave 1 million to the EFF who does far less for privacy and internet freedom i think your well meaning assessment of the value of openbsd is indicative of the chronic lack of appreciation that they receive for being arguably the most productive and influential open source project in the world. that said, make no mistake your donation is hugely appreciated as-is and as a long time openbsd user i am not complaining about your decency and generosity as a human being. 
California Spectrum Care, the non-profit I work for has applied and one of our main focuses is providing services for the higher functioning group of people with autism. You're right. The Current system doesn't really have a place for those that suffer from less severe forms of developmental disabilities. Unfortunately, most other companies cater towards the more severe disabilities, and even the funding in this industry tends to avoid the higher functioning individual. The state doesn't believe that a high functioning person needs 1-to-1 care, so they end up never getting the attention they need to address any deficits they may have. Hopefully, we can help change this attitude. 
We will. This is one of our focus areas.
Plus one for save the children, sea shepherd and would like to add medecin sans frontieres
"+1 for researching Effective Altruism!

But I think in this case, it may not make sense to assume that the money can translate into lives saved at the same rate as if you were donating a smaller amount of money. ie most organizations are partially limited on money, and partially limited on other factors, so adding more money only helps to a point. This is called a ""funding gap"": while you may be able to save a life per $1000 for the first thousand lives, it might not scale as well above that. So you'll probably end up splitting it up anyway.

Ultimately the important point though is to consider not just ""does this organization look good?"" when going to donate, but to investigate also the question ""what will the actual effects of my money be here?""

(EDIT: clarified ""funding gap"")"
"Another completely disabled ME-CFS patient here.
This illness RUINS lives. 

It is the most torturous disease I know about.

Please donate to OMF - https://www.omf.ngo/the-end-mecfs-project/

In 1994, one of the world’s most renowned ME/CFS clinicians, Dr Daniel L Peterson from the US, powerfully expressed the severity of ME: “In my experience, it is one of the most disabling diseases that I care for, far exceeding HIV disease except for the terminal stages” (Introduction to Research and Clinical Conference, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, October 1994; published in JCFS 1995:1:3-4:123-125).

In 1995, Professor Mark Loveless, Head of the AIDS and ME/CFS Clinic at Oregon Health Sciences University said in his Congressional Briefing that an ME/CFS patient:

“feels effectively the same every day as an AIDS patient feels two weeks before death; the only difference is that the symptoms can go on for never-ending decades”.


In 2004, Dr William Reeves, Chief of the ME/CFS research programme at the US Centres for Disease Control, (CDC) reported that ME/CFS patients “are more sick and have greater disability than patients with chronic obstructive lung or cardiac disease, and that psychological factors played no role” (Press Release, AACFS, 7th October 2004).


Also in 2004, a randomised clinical trial found “In comparison with other chronic illnesses such as multiple sclerosis, end-stage renal disease and heart disease, patients with (ME)CFS show markedly higher levels of disability” (Am J Occup Ther 2004:58:35-43).


In 2005, Nancy Klimas, Professor of Medicine, Division of Immunology, University of Miami; Co-Director, E.M. Papper Laboratory of Clinical Immunology; Professor of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Miami, and Director of AIDS Research and Co-Director of the AIDS Clinical Research Unit, Miami VA Medical Centre, said in her American Association for CFS In-coming Presidential Address: “Our patients are terribly ill, misunderstood, and suffer at the hands of a poorly informed medical establishment and society”.


In a Keynote Lecture on 27th May 2007 at the ME Research UK International Conference held at the University of Edinburgh, Nancy Klimas listed the three main categories of diagnostic symptoms as being autonomic, inflammatory and endocrine, all of which indicate serious underlying pathology. Klimas, a world expert in ME/CFS, was one of the authors of “Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Clinical Working Case Definition, Diagnostic and Treatment Protocols” (JCFS 2003:11(1):7-115), which is usually known as “the Canadian Definition”. An Overview of that document (“ME/CFS: A Clinical Case Definition and Guidelines for Medical Practitioners”) states:


“ME/CFS is an acquired organic, pathophysiological, multisystemic illness that occurs in both sporadic and epidemic forms. Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ICD 10 G93.3), which includes CFS, is classified as a neurological disease in the World Health Organization’s International Classification of Diseases (ICD). Chronic fatigue must not be confused with ME/CFS because the “fatigue” of ME/CFS represents pathophysiological exhaustion and is only one of many symptoms. Compelling research evidence of physiological and biochemical abnormalities identifies ME/CFS as a distinct, biological, clinical disorder”

"Yeah 100%, ping Elie Hassenfeld who runs GiveWell, his email is firstname @. Speaking to him next week, I'll flag this so he doesn't miss it.

Or email Will MacAskill, author of doing good better, he's lovely, entirely not self-interested and would find time to advise. His email is equally easy to guess.

If part of your donations is to poverty, it's well worth speaking to them or doing research. Research suggests the best charities are 10-100x more impactful per dollar than the average. So donating $40m to poverty normally could be equivalent to donating $400k really well.

Wherever you give - you are so so awesome. My heart goes out to you. I just really *really* hope (selflessly) that you research modern evaluation techniques properly. The health / poverty component anyway."
You the real MVP. (Most Valuable Pineapple)💯
I also attended a First Descents camp and it was life changing! They are doing amazing work for an extremely underserved population. Please consider a donation to them!
Yeah I'm glad they're running lean enough to weather a downturn in donations or some unexpected expenses.
