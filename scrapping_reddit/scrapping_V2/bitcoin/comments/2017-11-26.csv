"Welcome /r/all!

Edit: **9000** upvotes! META.

Edit **40,000** upvotes.... MEME MAGIC IS REAL. 

The crypto currency known as Bitcoin has hit an all time high of $9000! 

Alternatively: 1 mBTC (MilliBitcoin) is over $9.

We all did you’re not alone comrade 
I'd like to think that people wanting to see this meme had something to do with it going from 8000 to 9000 so quickly
"Already approaching $9200, haha.

See you on the moon bitches!"
Lol, it took like a week to go from 8 to 9? I almost want it to slow down. I’ve never seen my money grow this easily...it feels too good to be true.

"To everyone coming here from r/all, joining this rollercoaster is easier than you think. But make sure you do your research first.

You don't have to buy a whole Bitcoin."
There are several exchanges for Bitcoin in the UK. Coinbase is the most friendly and works in the UK IIRC. 
Cheapest you could do right now is about 10 cents, but that might take 6 hours to get there. If you paid 3 dollars it should be there in 5 mins

"It's not a dumb question. Bitcoin is traded publicly 24/7. The price of one Bitcoin has for the first time hit $9,000 tonight. We expect that number to reach 10k by the end of the year. 

It's important to keep in mind that you do not need to buy a whole bitcoin,  you can buy fractions of one. "
I would, it’s a once in a lifetime opportunity. Start with Bitcoin.org. 
"It's all fairly simple once broken down. To buy bitcoin you need to use one of the exchanges that offers them for USD (or whatever currency you may use). I personally like [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com) because it's easy to use , but [Gemini](https://gemini.com/) and [GDAX](https://www.gdax.com/) are also good exchanges, and there are a few others.

Simply make an account, and click buy.

After they process your transaction, your BTC will be stored on a wallet on the exchange. It's generally a terrible idea to keep your money on an exchange though, so you'll want to take it off there whenever possible. To do this you'll need to make a wallet. There's a lot of information about this available, but [here was a pretty good write up about wallets](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/7fjwda/usb_memory_sticks_ok_to_store_bitcoin/dqce2nn/) recently in /r/bitcoinbegginers

">Every time you fuckers get to the front page I kick myself for being too poor to have invested on the last milestone

 You should be kicking yourself anyways because you can invest any amount you like at a time, you don't need to buy a whole coin. "
you can buy as little as $10 worth since theyre divisible up to 8 decimal places (h/t /u/trrrrouble). Totally worth it to use some of your speculative fund money on it.
"You can buy tiny fractions of a Bitcoin. It's not like a stock.

And who knows if you should buy.  Its growth this year is absurd. It could crash to $1k or skyrocket to $100k at this point."
">  Better to instead get your cash and lite it on fire. At least you get to look at a pretty flame.

SAME! I remember seeing that post and thinking, what the fuck  $5k for a virtual coin? There has to be more to it than this, and there was. I'm so excited to be on this train. 
It's never too late. Next month when it hits $10k you'll be mad you didn't buy some now.

"The people who think it's overvalued. Some people don't believe in main-stream cryptocurrency adoption or think the one that reaches mainstream appeal will be another coin.  
  
I personally have doubts about Bitcoin's off-chain scaling solutions, but I'm not an idiot so I'm not shorting a cryptocurrency"
"Well, obviously, bitcoin can't rapidly rise forever. At some point, it'll go down by some amount. 

Is Bitcoin *really* four times as big now as it was back in May? Is the shooting up in value *really* a reflection of the fundamental market forces below bitcoin? Or are there are a lot of speculators pushing the price up? 

At some point, you might see, say, Bitcoin crash to $3000, and then be back up to $4200 a week later and rise slowly from there (a lot of times, when something crashes, it crashes too hard and shoots back some of the way up). Or maybe it'll go up to like $40,000 next year and crash *real* hard. Or maybe it'll have a soft pop to like $6000. Maybe it gets to $X in value and then flatlines for a long enough that all the speculators pull out. But it certainly won't be quadrupling in value every eight months. At some point between now and the heat death of the universe, shorting bitcoin will be a real good idea. 

Now, *when* that is, who fucking knows, and that's the most important thing, isn't it?"

Not trying to stir the pot. But can you please explain to me why bitcoin is the best option out of all other crypto currencies currently? Thanks for ya time, congrats on the gainz
Wake me up when September ends
"Make a coinbase account and set up weekly buys for what you spend on scratchoffs. Skip a night out and put the $50 you would spend into bitcoin instead. Once the CME group starts futures trading traditional investors will start dipping their toes in and you still have a chance to be an early adopter. 

For what its worth I downloaded a bitcoin wallet onto my phone back in 2013 when I first heard about it but I was young and realized I needed a debit card to buy and did not want to go through the trouble, then I hear about it this year and i already knew the basics about it so i jumped in headfirst and 1800 was a tough hurdle to jump too with the wannacry ransomware attack giving bad press and it was after a large runup from $1000. 
If you are going to gamble do it on bitcoin not on scratch offs. 

Once you learn bitcoin that opens up avenues to all the other crypto currencies and there is alot of money to be made there and also alot of money to be lost. 

"
Guess what,  ITS STILL CHEAP!  Bitcoin has a long way to go and you only need to buy what you can afford to lose.  You don't have to buy 1 bitcoin completely, you can buy a fraction of a bitcoin and that will also accumulate in value. Bitcoin is deflationary and we have never had a money that could do and prove this. And you only have to trust math. 
I recently found a graph where in 2013 the bitcoin cost took a dip before the current climb. I mined 10 dollars in 2013. It’s probably 900 dollars now. I am pretty bummed out. A friend bought bitcoin at 900 and asked me if he should sell. I told him to hold
are you saying you still haven't bought? dude for christ's sake stop doing this to yourself! buy bitcoin!
"I put some money into bitcoin, but I'm not getting rich off it.  I'm super jealous of those with tens, hundreds or even thousands of bitcoin now, but that's life.  Can't let those things get ya down!


just kidding my shame is like the heat of a thousand suns and I regret not investing more everyday"
What if youre Australian. How do you go about these transactions?
[deleted]
"There's no true way to know what the currency will do. 


However I will offer these facts: There will only ever be 21 million bitcoin (BTC), many yet to be mined, and some already lost. It is a currency that completely bypasses the need for exchange rates or bank fees (though it has its own fees), so if you want to send money to your friends or support a cause in any country, no big deal. BTC is divisible to 8 decimal places so you can buy 1 BTC for $9000, or 0.1 for $900, or 0.01 for $90. These are facts about BTC.

My own comments about BTC: since investing from just earlier this year my return on investment is 229%. I finally have a safety net of savings, something I've never had in my life. My only regret is not doubling down earlier,  but I had bills to pay. Invest what you can afford to lose,  and what you can afford to not see again for at least a year.  That's my suggestion. Holding for a year should lower your capital gains taxes. Don't try and day trade or short or anything.  Just put money in at regular intervals,  every week or every month and start saving up. Use BTC whenever you can,  but remember there will be taxes to consider. 

BTC is entirely worth it in my mind.  When the dust settles on this 9k goal,  it will most likely drop,  and slowly rise back up, just look at the other all time highs. 

If you buy, do your research, find an exchange that has minimal or no fees. Not to shill,  but I'm using gdax, which is owned by Coinbase. Coinbase has an easy interface, with high fees. I suggest starting there,  buying a small amount,  and learning how to manage that small amount.  If it is for you,  try GDAX. Gdax has all the trading tools you want,  but is more complex,  with basically no fees. 

Always move your coins off an exchange. Learn about hardware wallets. At minimum have your wallet on your pc or laptop, and consider a cold storage wallet like trezor.

Is it too late?  No one can be sure.  Many said BTC was dead at $600. Many speculate it could be worth 10 times what is at right now, or more. If global adoption occurs, I personally feel like we are still in the infancy of BTC."
Use gdax, not coinbase. Same company without the fees.
Pro tip: Learn about paper and hardware wallets. Never leave your coins on an exchange for long periods. You only own the coins you hold yourself.
My girlfriend doesn’t understand why I kept refreshing Blockfolio 60 times over 2 minutes just to see this meme. Safe to say we are breaking up now.

I was yelling at everyone to buy at 350..  no one listened.. and either did i.. at least i have a small excuse.. my money was tied up in other investments albeit liquid.. however the people i yelled at probably still have their money sitting in 1% savings accounts..

"How many of these are really that different from current banking though? 

Also, bitcoin isn't ""backed"" by anything either so it doesn't make it any better than government currency in that sense. The peer to peer transfers are almost the same unless you are in the rare case that you live in or try to send it to some country who would deny a money transfer. "
If you don't have alot of money to invest, say within the hundreds, it would still be worth it right?

"> If you buy for day trading you may lose money, but if you hold long term, it has been proven you get nice ROI.

This is misleading and incorrect. It's not proven that you will get a return on your investment if you hold long term. Especially since bitcoin's value looks like a textbook bubble. Past performance does not guarantee future performance, it's one of the most important disclosures of investing. "

sell $50 worth, let the rest ride. 
Less than 16 million available coins.  Never forget that.
"Lets look at it logically. If you look at any chart, you can see the rate of growth is increasing in an exponential fashion. We went from 3k to 9k in less time than we went from 1k to 3k. If we extrapolate on that basis, we will go to 15k in the next couple of weeks, and then to 25k in less than two weeks. 

If you think well go beyond that, in order to maintain this pump, without going into a scary reversal, or somehow going sideways out of a completely vertical, and lets face it, speculative rise, we need to start gainaing roughly 100 billion dollars in value every week. Then 200, then 300. It gets a bit silly. At that rate, wed catch up with gold by march, and have all the worlds assets under our belts by december next year.

If you think that is possible, pour your life savings in. Otherwise be very cautious. Everyone here is trying to make money. When people are tying to make money things go down as fast as they go up. "
"People said ""This can't keep up"" at 4,000 last month too. Maybe it can, maybe it can't, but I don't think Bitcoin is going anywhere anytime soon. And as for the dot com bubble, how long did it take to recover? :-)"
The question, I think, is how many people in your life actually own any bitcoin? I think we're still pretty far away from a dot com type of bubble. My plumber doesn't have any bitcoin yet.

I bought $10 at around $430/BTC. It's been fun watching it grow, but I'm sure wishing I had bought more haha.
"The easiest/quickest method would be to use Coinbase.  Coinbase is extremely user-friendly, and you simply just sign up for an account, enter your banking information to fund the account, and start buying bitcoin.

If you have any specific questions, feel free to PM me.  There are other websites out to get bitcoin which have pros and cons, but, for someone is completely new to bitcoin, I'd say Coinbase is the most user-friendly."

I teach in Japan and have a student this semester named Satoshi. I was just telling him yesterday how cool it was his name is a now a denomination of money. 
"That's a good and bad idea.  Good because it makes bitcoin appear more 'affordable' for people, but bad because it'll cause a lot of confusion.  For people who don't understand that you can buy a fraction of a bitcoin, that group of people probably will just be more confused with the introduction of Bit and Satoshi.

Bit and Satoshi make perfect sense to people like you and I who have some sort of grasp of bitcoin, but to the person who is already intimidated by bitcoin, this would likely only make things more complicated."

"""Hacked"""
Semi-close. They got hacked, and tried to cover it up by trading while insolvent. Everyone who lost their money on mtgox kind of deserved it for placing faith in Mark Karpeles. It wasn't even a hindsight thing - it was well known he was shady as fuck. The guy had already been sued in France, and 'mtgox' stood for 'magic the gathering online exchange'. He literally turned his MTG website into a Bitcoin website and didn't get a new domain. How they were trading millions of dollars a day in volume is beyond me.
"Exactly,  that person took a loss for a while,  then made huge

I think it's going to dip and bump,  but the bubble won't be full for a long while,  or until there's a mass exodus to another coin"
"""Only when the tide goes out do you discover who has been swimming naked.""  -  Warren Buffett

The way I always see it is that VERY few of those early buyers actually held onto their coins long enough to make a ton of money off of it. Those that are still holding today are few and far between, and I doubt I would have had the willpower to not sell at some point between now and then. It’s human nature. Hell I’ve bought and sold like twenty times just in the past year because I keep thinking “no way it goes higher than this” lol.  But who the hell knows at this point, I may just toss a few hundred dollars in and force myself to ignore it for a few years and hope I’m richer for it.

"You haven't been mining bitcoin right? You're losing more than you gain, even if electricity is free (hardware costs).

THIS is the truth. While there are a few rich holders, the majority of bitcoin's investing base holds each only hundreds to thousands of dollars. Fewer have their life savings in bitcoin, and most buyers are young people.

I bought $100 worth during the last drop at $5800. Now I'm just going to sit on my 0.046 and see what happens.
That was fast 
"There were hundreds of people actively saying ""Don't trust Mtgox"", citing Mark Karpeles as untrustworthy. There were also dozens of posts pretty much daily on every Bitcoin forum about how you don't own any Bitcoin if you don't control your private keys. Anyone who lost coins on Mtgox was trusting a known fraudster with their money. "
"Knowing what we do now about the status of it, it sure seems like the ""hack"" was bullshit so they could declare bankruptcy. Once they did and he ""found"" all those missing coins, they were suddenly only worth the dollar value at the time of the bankruptcy declaration, and he gets to pocket the difference.
The perfect setup.
And knowing that any exchange could pull the same shit, I'd be very leery of leaving any coins on one."
True, but IMO it shows that the exchange was incredibly unprofessional from its origins. I dealt with Karpeles a long time back when he was still in France and he always seemed incredibly slimy. 
"You get over that. The third or fourth time you sell only to watch the price keep rising, you decide--you know what? I'll hold.

"Just my opinion, and I have no credentials, but I'd suggest running a full node. The more we have going, the stronger the network.

Check out GreenAddress. I have it in my iPhone. But for more money than you would carry in your leather wallet, use a hardware wallet (user friendly and very secure) or a paper wallet. For information about wallets, it’s best to read about them on bitcoin.org (official site) [https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) 
That's what people said about $8. That's what people will say about $9000 if it goes to $12000. Hindsight is 20/20. You could buy in right now, and the Chinese whale pools could decide to crash it back to $1000.

"GreenBits for android! its important to avoid wallets like mycelium that don't support segwit addresses. Using the right wallet can save you 30-95% in fees (if you set a custom fee)

For the more serious user I'd recommend going to https://www.bitaddress.org/ and generating a few paper wallets, which are then printed out and stored in a gun safe. Then later on you can use an app like GreenBits to scan the QR code on the paper wallet and send the bitcoin where you wish."
Exactly.
You can buy bitcoin with credit or debit etc you don’t need to mine it to acquire bitcoin. Try Coinbase.com but send your bitcoin to a more secure wallet after that.

"Yeah, it certainly feels too good to be true at times.

"You should also be prepared to lose every $ that you intend to invest.

If you aren't ok with that then you shouldn't invest a portion of your hundreds."
"Do your own due diligence. But know that you do not need to buy whole bitcoins at a time, they are divisible out to 8 decimals. 

I'd recommend using GDAX for smaller dollar-cost-averaging schemes because they offer zero fee transfers out, and very low commission. This way, a $30 weekly purchase will still get you over $29 in your desktop wallet. Using other exchanges, or even Coinbase with credit cards, and you'd have $25 or less. Don't get eaten by fees."
It's also important to note that you can buy fractions of a bitcoin and aren't forced to just buy one whole bitcoin.  $9000 for one BTC is extremely steep, but you can get in with as little as $1's worth of bitcoin.
He literally had this shit typed up and ready to submit to r/all
All of r/bitcoin was. They all had this gif and were all waiting for the day they could post this gif. 
Indubitably 
Coinbase is a good place to start. You can buy as little as a $1 worth, you don’t have to do a full bitcoin

Proven history of resiliency and improvement stretching back past the beginning of the decade, with no attack vector successfully bringing Bitcoin down or subverting it's core values.
While /u/etan_ashman has a point about it's inability to effect BTC itself, there are a few strong arguments as to how harming net neutrality will also harm cryptocurrency. The most straightforward one being that if they can throttle bandwidth and charge more to allow you to access or use exchanges, or even more importantly throttle miners directly, that'd be a *huge* blow to the American crypto market, which certainly isn't an insubstantial portion of the total cryptocurrency market cap.

My $20 bucks a few months ago worth 50+. Any amount of growth is fun and beneficial.
Thank you, I thought you had to buy in whole units. Think I'll drop $20 on it and see how things go. How do you buy btc?
"Bit = 1/1,000,000 BTC

Satoshi = 1/100,000,000 BTC


These should be the standard measurements. "

"Not OP, but I can answer.

It's the largest and oldest. Now this may seem like a logical fallacy at first whiff, but what it means is that BTC is anti-fragile. A currency and/or store of value must be resilient and secure, above all else. 

BTC has clawed back from 5 or so major crashes in value, each time the trough was higher than the previous peak. It has also fought off several contentious hard forks that can be considered hostile takeovers for all intents and purposes. 

This also means that in the past 8 years, no major fault has been found and exploited in the software. People can count on Bitcoin. 

And in being the largest coin, Bitcoin attracts the best developers. It's always been an open source project, and development continues to grow, with exciting second-level technologies on the horizon like Lightning Network and Schnorr Signatures. These will allow Bitcoin to scale to larger and larger throughputs."
Google MtGox
"Someone correct me if I'm wrong

But I believe the MT site was ran like a bank to hold bitcoins for you and the owner up and stole all the bitcoins. "
Do framed Enron shares count as sharp? Either way, not to worry, the roof over his head is safe at Fannie Mae.
"I hear the odd story on the news but I think it's convoluted enough to keep a majority of people out of it for at least a few more years.

From my perspective in Canada at least."
"I love your levelhead and that is what I also think.

I have followed BTC since the beginning. I never really had a need for being on the Silk Road, so inherently I saw BTC as a novelty and a nifty idea.  I once thought it was cool that you could turn your PC on and make money (through mining) but at the time the electricity costs far outmeasured the gains (still relevant for average dudes).

At this point I look at BTC closing in on 10k and thinking ""this has to be to bubble bursting right?""


God damn it. I thought that same thing since 3k.  When will this madness end?  Leveraging into all crypto seems to still be ""early"". I only hope I'm right.  Fuck it. As our lord savior Drake once said ""YOLO""."

That's when we just post a gif of 10 of this gif

"i regret not caring about what seemed to be a small amount of coin back in the day. 

the thing is, we can’t just continue to dwell on the past. let’s buy up some of that coin and become those rich people with hundreds of thousands in btc profit"
Id say its even better in EU. Sepa transactions are cheaper. If you are only gonna spend usd 100 you can pay with visa (the fee is really high with visa though)
I'm ridiculed by almost everyone i know IRL for having bitcoins. i dont even know what to say anymore... sorry for making a ton of money, want to join in like I've suggested since 2013? 
Mt.Gox is a bitcoin exchange that was hacked and millions in bitcoin were lost
Any exchange or other financial institution is vulnerable to theft, fraud, legal action, hacking, etc. Coinbase is trustworthy enough, but once your coins are in your wallet with private key in your control (think of that as a really long password), no force on earth can move your money.

Maybe one day we'll look back and laugh at this post. Not because of the reference, but because of all the fanfare for such a small amount when BTC is valued at $100k.
I turn around for 10 minutes and miss it.

"If you are new to Bitcoin, remember that:

1) You didn't miss the boat. Bitcoin is still in its early phases and it hasn't yet even come close to reaching mass adoption or institutional investment.

2) Bitcoin is highly divisible. The price is never ""too high"" to invest your first $50 into it - a 200% increase is still 200%, no matter how much of a Bitcoin you've bought, and it is predicted to keep going.

3) The best time to invest in Bitcoin was 7 years ago. The second best time is NOW.
There were people kicking themselves at $1000 that they missed the boat. These same people will be kicking themselves at $100,000."

"Posting in a legendary thread.

Bitcoin is going to change the world. Yes, the price is rising, but it isn't about that. It's decentralised banking - bank accounts and payments between them without a bank. Like Uber to taxi companies, or AirBnB to hotels. Mathematically verified, with no trust in any third-party, or any permission required. It is impossible for anyone to freeze your holdings if they don't have your private keys. It is banking for the billions of unbanked people in the world. Please read about the technology; it is so much more than just an asset to be traded and profited from.

yes, it's technically 9050
Won't change the world until more people start using it instead of just hodling.
The problem is, in order for it to be user-friendly/secure enough for grandma to use, a bank-like service will have to manage user's coins.  Otherwise it's only being used by us computer people.
I've have nothing but admiration for anyone who was gutsy enough to try and short bitcoin in this market. They boldly went where no HODLER would even imagine going and lost their money in style.
Who the fuck would wanna short Bitcoin? That sounds about as intuitive at pouring gasoline over a live BBQ grill.

> Bitcoin is a worldwide-distributed decentralized peer-to-peer censorship-resistant trustless and permissionless deflationary system/currency (see Blockchain technology) backed by mathematics, open source code, cryptography and the most powerful and secure decentralized computational network on the planet, orders of magnitude more powerful than Google and government combined. There is a limit of 21 million bitcoins (divisible into smaller units). ""Backed by Government"" money is not backed by anything and is infinitely printed at will by Central Banks. Bitcoin is limited and decentralized.

> **Receive and transfer money, from cents (micropayments) to thousands:**
> 
> * Very cheap regardless of amount $$$ sent (with new apps coming)
> 
> 
> * Borderless (no country can stop it from going in/out or confiscate)
> 
> * Trustless (nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work)
> * Privacy (no need to expose personal information)
> * Securely (encrypted cryptographically and can’t be confiscated)
> * Permissionless (no approval from central powers needed)
> * Instantly (from seconds to a few minutes)
> * Open source (auditable by anybody)
> * Worldwide distributed (from anywhere to anywhere on the planet)
> 
> * Censorship resistant (no government can stop its use)
> 
> * Peer-to-peer (no intermediaries with a cut)
> * Portable (easier to carry/move than cash, gold and silver)
> * Public ledger (transparent, seen by everybody)
> * Scalable (each bitcoin is divisible down to 8 decimals)
> * Decentralized (distributed with no single point of failure)
> * Deflationary (its supply goes down with time until reaching 21 million ever)
> * Immutable global registry (can’t be altered/hacked by nobody)
> * No chargebacks-No fraud ('push' vs' 'pull' transactions).﻿

*And that’s just as currency, Bitcoin has many more uses and applications.*

Edit: Bitcoin.org is the legit Bitcoin site. Stay away from fake ""Bitcoin"" stuff like r/""btc"", ""Bitcoin"".com, Bcash (""Bitcoin"" Cash/BCH), ""Bitcoin"" Gold, etc."
You're the one.
I stayed up later than I planned to watch this.
Now that $9,000 has been breached, we will go from 9k to 10k faster than we went from 8k to 9k.

"Nobody did any effort...

"
Can someone link the guy who said he'd eat his left testicle at $10k, he must be getting pretty nervous...
Is it too late at this point? I thought $100 was pushing it and never bought lol man, do I feel stupid!
"Nigga we made it.

Remember seeing these ""over 9000"" memes like 2-3 years ago, and it was just as kind of a joke, crazy."
NANI?!?!?
FELLAS WE MADE IT
It’s on a god damn rampage 
Toasting in epic bread.
Holly shit here we come 10K
Damn, it is almost 9,100 already.
Remember 8k anyone? Fucking forever ago.
Well, I'm happy. 
Haha yes
Got the price alert and am stoked!
Over 9000
Vegeta, I can't get a read on his power level...

"You think this is it? Wait till that Big Bang Theory episode hits. 

Just. Fucking. Wait.


There's a reason you won't see major networks cover it on their business sister channels. They're backed by companies that have interests against crypto. I'm actually flabbergasted they'd mention it on the show. It's like the cancer cure equivalent to money."
$10,000 by Monday morning at this rate !!
"To any newbies thinking about getting in.

1. Don't panic buy. There are more gains in the future and it will take time.
2. Get an account on coinbase or look into localbitcoins. Coinbase is like the simplest and user friendlyist method possible.
3. Buy a small amount. like $20 or something and then WAIT. The worst thing you can do is buy a lot of bitcoin all at once.
4. In the meantime familiarize yourself with bitcoin using bitcoin**.org**
5. Be especially wary of scammers! ""Bitcoin Cash"", ""Bitcoin Gold"", Bitconnect, etc are **not** bitcoin. They are literal scams.
6. The links in the sidebar are good.
7. Learn about Dollar Cost Averaging / Automatic Investing and do that after you are comfortable with your $20.
8. Realize that you, yes you, value losses far greater than gains. If you have $100 to your name and you gain $50 you value this less than losing $50. If you are not aware of this, and you only buy bitcoin because of a fear of missing out then you will inevitably sell at a loss ensuring you lose money. Better to instead get your cash and lite it on fire. At least you get to look at a pretty flame."
Get the 10000 gifs ready peeps
Forget the moon. We're going to Namek.
WTF its over $9450 now . SERIOSULY WTF! OMG! AHAHA
Guess it’s time to crack open the old PC from 2010 and see if I can remember what the hell I did with my two bitcoin. 
Note to future self: This was a good day. Also stop reading though your old reddit posts and just enjoy all the money I made you. Your welcome. 
IT'S UNDER 9000!!!
It was at 3,700$ a piece when I started this semester 
Can't wait to see the price when Amazon start accepting Bitcoin next year :)
"3 weeks ago I decided not to buy at around 6k

safe to say I hate myself"
"It's over $9000!!!

YEEHAW.  I mean, GW all, keep mining and hodling and spreading the good word!

"There's still time to become an ""early adopter"".

Adoption of technology usually comes in 5 phases. 

These phases consist of the ""Innovators"" (2.5%), ""Early Adopters"" (13.5%), ""Early Majority"" (34%), ""Late Majority"" (34%), and ""Laggards"" (16%). 

You can help accelerate the adoption of this new technology as well as become an early adopter today! All you need to do is educate yourself and maybe even buy a little Bitcoin!"
Just commenting because this is history :)
I've made 4$ off of bitcoin so far. Envy me and all my digital dough.
10k before New Years
It's going to hit 75k by the end of September 2018.
Should I...jump on this Bitcoin train while it speeds away?

"Nr. 1 on r/all

WE GOIN TO 10K SOOON BOYOS"
NANI?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
I just can’t wait until 1 BTC can purchase a house in the Midwest 
START THE DAMN FOMO BEFORE I PISS MYSELF
Okay how can I buy bitcoin? I need to get some but I am completely clueless as to how or where to buy them. Can somebody give me a semi-detailed rundown? I’d really like to get into it.
This feeling never gets old.
Part of history.
Am I too late for the hype?
Every time you fuckers get to the front page I kick myself for being too poor to have invested on the last milestone
I'd like to be a part of this history too. Hi. Hodling since 6k!
9100 on GDAX. WTF.
I put 1000 dollars into it during a crash a month ago when it hit 3000, and I made 2k profit. Pretty happy.
ToTheMoonGuy is going to need bitcoin to go to the moon if he's popping out kids that fast...
