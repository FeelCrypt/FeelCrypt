It doesnt suck. I mined a fair amount of bitcoin back in the day. I spent the bitcoin at places that accepted bitcoin. The way I look at it is that people like you and me kept the ecosystem alive to get to where it is now. If I would have have just held all of my coins what good does that do growing the bitcoin economy? I mean, currency needs to be circulated to work as a currency right?
Thanks! I mean I look at it like, I'm not down money and I didn't mortgage a house to buy in at $19,000 and then panic sell at $13,000. I'm sure way more people have it worse than me, there are probably dozens of stories like mine or worse, I just happened to tweet about it in 2011 with a #bitcoin hashtag.

You’re attitude is awesome man, and I’m right there with you. I bought, sent and sold so much BTC through 2014-2016 that I’m embarrassed to tell anyone. But now I just HODL a little bit and it makes me feel alright. Our initial faith and commitment to Bitcoin is a big reason why it is where it is. 
Amen to that. Good luck on your future crypto adventures!
