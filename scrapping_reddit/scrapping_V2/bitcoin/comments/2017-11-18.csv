Yeah 1btc=1btc, regardless of borders.

It's a reflection of the fact that by the time you extract $10,000 from Zimbabwe, you will only be left with $8,000.
"The price of bitcoin is determined entirely by supply and demand. The price is not even the same between different exchanges operating inside the same country.

If a country restricts its bitcoin supply in any way the price will increase locally, but may over time return to the global equilibrium.

Restrictions may include:

* No exchanges in country (money needs to sent to a foreign exchange)
* Exchanges cannot accept credit card payment
* etc.

The same thing will happen if something increases the demand, such as:

* High inflation on local currency
* Problems with the local banks
* etc

This is Bitcoin not lite coin, give me gold. 
Yes
unlike both this guy's nads.
"What concerns me, is that people arent actually spending bitcoin like normal currency. Most of the major websites that do accept it, are only accepting it because theres a third party payment processor that is taking the risk and ending up with the bitcoin, the sites just want USD/local currency. Most transactions that are happening are creation, and trading, and then despite what everyone wants to admit, the actual transactions where bitcoin is being used for payment, are usually shady ones.

The growing valuation can be whatever, but if theres nobody truly accepting it, theres no foundation, and I have a problem with that, and it seems like the actual adoption rate of retailers and non-bitcoin related companies has stalled."
I haven't tried replicating or anything but a financial guy crunched the numbers and said the, what, Pearson correlation coefficient, r squared, modeled 94% of bitcoins price variability over the past FOUR years based from two variables. 1) # of txs 2) square of number of users.  So barring an outside attack or mammoth programming screw up I don't see BTC retreating to 3,000 anytime soon. http://www.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-price-movement-explained-by-one-equation-fundstrat-tom-lee-metcalf-law-network-effect-2017-10

Everyone thinking it has value, makes it have value. Value is all about perception.

It's looking like its value is now being tied to genitalia consumption

Whatever gets us there :-)."
Hey man
I think of people on Reddit are like nation of semi-sane people with a sizable army of crazies who are likely going to try to hunt you down if & when Bitcoin crosses $10,000 in 2017 and they may try to force-feed your actual left ball.

"No he didn't or not?

""In 2009, he started a company that he said would manufacture plants from the Belize jungle into antibiotics. His lab was raided in May 2012 by the police department’s Gang Suppression Unit on suspicion he was manufacturing methamphetamine. He says the raid was retribution for his refusal to be extorted by the government. No illegal drugs were found during the raid. He was never charged and the lab was eventually shut down.

The Belize government declined ABC News’ request for comment.

McAfee was catapulted to the headlines again in November 2012. This time Belizean authorities linked him to a more serious crime, naming him ""a person of interest"" in the mysterious slaying of 52-year-old Gregory Faull, a U.S. man who was McAfee’s neighbor two doors down from McAfee’s beachside compound. McAfee went into hiding, telling ABC News at the time he was afraid the authorities were trying to kill him.

He has denied any involvement in Faull's death.

After being on the run for almost a month, McAfee was arrested in Guatemala by Guatemalan immigration officials for entering the country illegally. He was about to be deported back to Belize when he collapsed. McAfee later said he had faked a heart attack.

“Sure, I faked it""


http://abcnews.go.com/US/rise-fall-rise-john-mcafee-tech-pioneer-person/story?id=47346015

"
"That's not exactly what happened. Someone killed his neighbor in Belize. Then the cops wanted to ask him questions about it. 

He got paranoid that the cops were going to kill him and so he started his crazy venture to escape from South America. He wound up being detained in Guatemala  and faked a heart attack in order to avoid being deported to Belize. They never charged him with anything in Belize in connection to the murder. "
I heard a story that he enjoys glass tables in third world countries if you know what I mean.
"""Even the Bitcoin community"" 

The Bitcoin community is actually regarded as being pretty damn smart right now lol "
It was never proven he ever was making bath salts. He got raided several times and they never found a single thing. 
If Bitcoin falls to $1 in the next week I will cut off my finger and eat the flesh. No bambozzles. All the truths
Well he isn't wrong. *Yet*.
"**Tulip mania**

Tulip mania, tulipmania, or tulipomania (Dutch names include: tulpenmanie, tulpomanie, tulpenwoede, tulpengekte and bollengekte) was a period in the Dutch Golden Age during which contract prices for some bulbs of the recently introduced and fashionable tulip reached extraordinarily high levels and then dramatically collapsed in February 1637. It is generally considered the first recorded speculative bubble (or economic bubble); although some researchers have noted that the Kipper- und Wipperzeit (literally Tipper and See-saw) episode in 1619–1622, a Europe-wide chain of debasement of the metal content of coins to fund warfare, featured mania-like similarities to a bubble. In many ways, the tulip mania was more of a hitherto unknown socio-economic phenomenon than a significant economic crisis (or financial crisis). And historically, it had no critical influence on the prosperity of the Dutch Republic, the world's leading economic and financial power in the 17th century.

But if he makes a buy offer at 500k it'll go through, why wouldn't someone sell to him at above market price? 
Will the source code suffice? Any rules can change with concensus. Adding a decimal is easy if it is needed people will upgrade their nodes and it will add a decimal place.

Iirc someone developed some sort of probabilistic way to do it.  So to pay .5 sat you'd actually be creating a 50/50 chance transaction for 1 sat. Forget the details though
the current limit of 8 decimals is simply interface limitation, nothing but interface change is required to increase decimal points. no soft fork, no hard fork. Just client changes.
As I understand it, it can go much farther than just 8 decimals with just a soft-fork.

"**Werner Herzog Eats His Shoe**

Werner Herzog Eats His Shoe is a short documentary film directed by Les Blank in 1980 which depicts director Werner Herzog living up to his promise that he would eat his shoe if Errol Morris ever completed the film Gates of Heaven. The film includes clips from both Gates of Heaven and Herzog's 1970 feature Even Dwarfs Started Small. Comic song ""Old Whisky Shoes"", played by the Walt Solek Band, is the signature tune over the opening and closing credits.

Filmed in April, 1979, the film features Herzog cooking his shoes (the ones he claims to have been wearing when he made the bet) at the Berkeley, California restaurant Chez Panisse, with the help of chef Alice Waters.

Does it count if I sell 1 bitcoin to 10,000 people for a dollar each?
Oh boy!
Someone has actually already eaten their balls and it's on video.  Highly disturbing.  I hope bitcoin doesn't go to 10k in 2017.
I am willing to take a hit in my portfolio for this to happen.
Paging /u/calaber24p
He probably is a uni already 
It's currently over $10000 in Australia, it still counts he needs to eat his ball 
I hope he's ready. It's almost ball eating time.

As it turns out, Bitcoin is neither a store of value or a currency. It’s a bet for people to digest their genitals 
There is a loophole! What if he doesn't have a left ball?
"That already happened in the futures market.
Bon appetit."
Time to block this sub. It just reminds me of my missed opportunity...
Money ball. 
If bitcoin hits $100,000,000 I’ll get a tattoo of Donald trump with the quote “no regrats” on my face.
tehnically it hit 10kCAD
If you get this guy to eat his actual left ball, I will actually eat my right ball.
I think it's amazing that 5 years ago
[deleted]
It's tempting to trade just a single coin for $10k just to see some ball eating.
"They're already over $10,000 USD in a few places. 

Zimbabwe hit $13,000 USD:

http://money.cnn.com/2017/11/16/investing/bitcoin-zimbabwe-price/index.html

So, paging /u/calaber24p! Time to play the squirrel and chomp a nut! 



"
his actual left ball. as opposed to his fake left ball
is he gonna use a hard fork to eat it?
"i bet my left nut the cubs would win the world series last year. got diagnosed with testicle cancer 2 months later. 2 weeks after that they removed my left nut. 

careful what you wish for. "
first Mcafee, now this guy. What's up with people and their will to eat their own genitals?
He didn't say testicle.  He said ball.  Lots of wiggle room in that statement!
this is nasty.... yuck!  please do not do this
But does he really have the balls to do it?
I think it's amazing that 2 years ago that seemed unfathomable but now it's a possibility on a good week
"LOL I was sleeping but I am now awake to a million notifications. Just an update for everyone since there is a real possibility that 10k will happen in 2017. 

. No i havent forgotten, I get messages everyday at this point

. No I havent sold any of my coins, in fact I have more than when I made that statement. 

. I always thought bitcoin would hit 10k but I didnt think it would happen in 2017, which is why I made the comment. Personally I thought it would be more like 2019-2020 during the next halving, but things happened much quicker than I thought.

. John McAfee has nothing on me


At this point im mostly just trying to run out the clock. Since there is a possibility of it happening, I should probably set specifics. The price has to cross 10k USD on the bitcoinity average (so we get a nice gif) it cant be a flash spike like what happened to gemini a few months ago, it has to be what most people would consider real . If it happens I will do something, I promise. 
"
u/calaber24p how will it be prepared? Or are you going raw?
"They really should have been explicit about currency.

$10213AUD right now."

After reading this, I agree. This is NOT about the money anymore. Let's see some ball eating!!!
**BUY BUY BUY**
Show me some bitcoin trading website
doesn't appear he specified a market in which bitcoin has to surpass the 10k mark.. didn't bitcoin trade for over $13k in zimbabwe during the coup?
It’s over $10,000 in my country (Australia). Time to follow through.
He never specified a currency. It is currently at $10,309 in Australian dollayredoos, which is what I invested with. Eat up /u/calaber24p
Bitcoin grow day by day....you know.
But then John McAfee will not eat his own dick on national television.
/u/Calaber24p
No one ever answered me, what can you really spend bitcoin on? And in what countries? 
Time to invest my life savings in Bitcoin 
Does anyone know if this event will be televised?
But is the definition of left from his perspective - or the viewer's?
a real gentlem00n would deliver
Silly bitcoiners, this guy is simply leveraging. He probably invested in bitcoin. If it gets to 10k hes going to be rich and will just have a new one cloned in a lab, and if it doesnt get to 10k he doesnt have to eat his own testicle. L E V E R A G I N G
Has /u/calaber24p responded yet?
REminds me of [Werner Herzog eating his own shoe in a lecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_Herzog_Eats_His_Shoe)

"Bitcoins have to rise, rise, rise, rise, rise, rise, rise, rise!!!!! I habe bitcoins and i want to make money no limit. 

But to be realistic... it will hit 10.000$ and even more... 20.000, some say even 50.000$ and real optimists say 100.000$... lets hope the best"
BUY BUY BUY
"If you include all the forks/airdrops, it has already surpassed that!
"
Man I wish I would’ve bought some Bitcoins when they were only $300.
Never underestimate the power of bitcoin.It surprised us that its value could reach $8000 dollars this year from the $800 dollar price in january 2017.Anything can happen.
It’s over 10k in Australia. Did he specify which currency?  The devil is always in the details. 
Looks like meat is back on the menu boys!
He didnt say testicle, he can get away with eating a ball of rice or whatever
What's with all the autocannibalism. first dicks, now balls.
Everyone adjust your sell orders to $10,001
"He didn’t specify Canadian or American money 

It hit 10K Canadian "
Can't wait for that follow-up post explaining how his left ball tastes like

"Wow 19 million coins being used. That means that either Satoshi came back or someone found his 3 million Bitcoin wallet.

Is he still a time-traveller if he only sent the message back in time?
"Haha entertaining read but so much is already untrue, like all of it except the price path thus far..

Also he's suggesting that the price keeps rising by a power of 10 each year which would mean 1 BTC would be worth $1,000,000,000,000 in 2025 and there's supposedly 19 million bitcoins. How does the money supply of the world inflate to $1,000,000,000,000 x 19,000,000? "
This totally explains 2X

Hah, thats amazing, called the price in 2017 (maybe).
That...kind of just blew my mind.

RIP his account. He's going to ghost Reddit forever
Maybe someone can ask binging will ballbish. He might have a suggestion.
/u/calaber24p When does the second ball come off 20k in 2018? Be a team player.
Someone should buy him some schezuan sauce, and have it cooked up by Gordan Ramsay.

Im only counting bitcoinity's average for USD. Zimbabewe would be near impossible to actually liquidate the bitcoin into USD. I will do something if I lose the bet, but I want to lose fairly and most of all I want to see the 10k gif on bitcoinity!

Welcome to the internet.
I love this reply. Everyone else is getting silverware and then there’s this comment
Best comment.
It was unfathomable just 9 months ago. It was trading in the $1000-1200 range through May and everyone was going nuts because it spent most of 2016 floating around $600. The most optimistic estimates said we'd end 2017 at $2-3k on the high end.
"Haha. I’m surprised that many people saw that ONE comment. Well everyone should make sure to buy so we can see a guy eat his own ball. But....

u/calaber24p I agree with the statement “no spikes” that’s fair. However we want to still see some ball eating. Would you agree to eating a BULL TESTICAL (I hear they are a delicacy) if it hits say... 9000? I will help pitch in to buy the Bull Testical if that is a problem.
"
"Well
Glad to know we woke up at the same time"
"> If it happens I will do something, I promise.

I vote for a bunch of cow balls or a ball assortment of some kind  :D"
*BAMBOOZLE ALERT* your contract is legally binding! I wanna see some ball eating or riot!! 
"> I will do something

> *something*

No excuses! Eat your nut like a man, son."
"hahaha the user is still active.

 u/calaper24p you still stand by this?"
that’s exactly what u/calaber24p would say
yall are setting yourselves up for some bamboozling
Enough about the bitcoin apocalypse. Tell us more about the time machine.

Brb buying bitcoin
Still regret selling 2btc for <1500, years ago.

Hope so
I think 2017 is a bit to fast. But 2018 sure! 
This dude obviously wouldn’t do it, so why do guys even entertain this person?
Hey, fuck this guy - I'm missing my right ball, and it's not voluntary.  Think the whales can manipulate the market enough to get this dude to eat his ball?
Can’t wait to not watch that when btc hits 10k
He could just eat cheese balls left on the packet.
/u/omegamale23
ohhoo??
Also I think about the person that took out $329k on their house and put it into Bitcoin @~$1709.  They said they'd sell at $10k. 
HODL!
I don't like any of this
I think we need r/bamboozle_insurance on this
Bitcoin community is not like any other community. I love it.
Remind me! 1 month
You should know that the bamboozle insurance on this one is *not* cheap.
doesn't seem fair to his left ball. lefties are always discriminated against.

On Christmas, bitcoin cross $10k.

Canadian prices today man
RemindMe! 7 days 
Oh god, I wasn't ready
Folks over at r/btc and r/bitcoin have already done that.
BUY IT
If it doesn’t hit $10k, I️ volunteer to pay him the full difference of $10k/BTC and whatever his holdings are totaled at, just to see him eat his left ball. Just to be clear, his left ball is his left testicle, not some ball he referred to in a pun. 
I think there’s a subreddit for that.
You already got bamboozled.
Sweaty balls 
nom nom nom nom
Don't knock the coin if you can't taste the groin
I’m very curious to see if he first cuts the ball off and then eats it, or if he has the flexibility to bite it off... ahh what a time to be alive
">TIL: Never make a wager that Bitcoin won't meet some crazy condition. 

So John Mc A. has learned that lesson?!?... "
Also don't make any wagers where you don't get anything out of it if you're right. Wtf is with ppl on reddit? 
Also, never, ever [short Bitcoin](https://imgur.com/j7MZuMZ).
