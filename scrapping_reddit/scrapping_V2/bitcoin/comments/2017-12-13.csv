"Perhaps not the greatest way to phrase it, but the value of bitcoin is based solely on the amount of new money put into it. How much people are willing to offer for it.

Perhaps you don't need to bring in new people etc., but you're still getting rich off the backs of the hopeful dolts thinking it's going to make them rich.

And it might, as long as more and more hopeful people invest and think bitcoin has value."
Yes it’s worth what the greater fool is willing to pay!
Yes you do. If you held index funds you came back very strong. If you owned property you eventually ended up with a net gain if you held.
Yeah you do. You can file losses on the stock market with the IRS and get tax breaks.
"you can write off losses on your taxes. can you do that with bitcoin?

Yeah, with all this hullabaloo regarding bitcoin, if I were gonna put money into it I'd wait until this weird bubble pops. Buying now is just asking for trouble, it's like buying a house in 2007 right before the market collapsed.

"It's not quite. Smart investing has more than a 49% chance of return, because the only battle is against other products in the same market, and certain things (like bitcoin) are entirely new markets where the only risk is whether the market will materialise. 

This means it's very easy to make money off of volatile investment, so long as you put in small amounts that you can afford to lose, as the return on a single profitable volatile market vastly outweighs the losses on unprofitable one"

It still costs you a lot more.
But we (other first world countries) finish our studies debt free. I'd take paying more taxes any day. 
Because, atleast in germany, you have, basically, your health insurance covered by your *taxes* as well. Another point where you pay a **lot** more than everybody else.
Russian more likely. 
"That's complete nonsense when you actually look at the numbers, though.

Let's get specific so that we can do just that.  Who couldn't the EU's $226 billion in military spending manage to protect them from? Russia and their comparatively piddling $69.2 billion? Who couldn't the NATO nations, barring America, defend themselves against? 

Who *exactly* are you protecting from who?"
Or we'd just only be able to blow up the world's population two or three times instead of 50. I mean stockpiling all those nuclear weapons is freaking expensive and provides zero actual military benefit.
Super advanced weaponry is a force multiplier beyond what you get from chronic overspending.

Which is, in a sense, the opposite to the point most people are making here, that tertiary education is too expensive for most to afford and that this makes it impossible to study any subject that isn't likely to land you a high-paying job immediately after graduation. The kid with 1 million USD in the bank (where it hopefully sits, rather than in a bitcoin wallet) is in the unique position to be able to go to university to study anything he wants without worrying about return on investment. The fact that he choses not to is merely a manifestation of anti-intellectualism and a reflection of his belief that something isn't worth studying unless you can profit from it.

"A pyramid scheme is a very particular type of fraudulent scheme whereby investors are paid for bringing in new investors. 

I personally believe Bitcoin is a massive bubble (who knows when it'll burst though) but it's not a pyramid scheme. 

The price of BTC is simply the result of supply and demand, as is the case for any other asset ever. Internet companies in the '90s dotcom crash were not pyramid schemes; railway companies in the 1840s were not pyramid schemes. They are just examples of breakthrough technology where people initially got a bit too excited.

Uhh... wrong. It's actually the complete opposite. There's only 21-million bitcoin, period. Versus the US govt that will print up mo'money whenever it sees fit. Anyways, realizing there are misinformed people everywhere. Ignore the people still insisting the world is flat."

Well, right, there are no gains or losses until you sell. But, if you buy at 10k and sell at 1k, you write those loses off (just as with other commodities). If you don't sell, you don't pay gains or take loses on taxes.

Pretty sure that is a uBit. The smallest unit adds two decimal places and is a Satoshi."
"The protocol supports arbitrary splitting of BTC, currently one millionth is the limit which could be changed to trillionth or smaller any time.

However the current high tx fees leed to a economic inflation while the entire BTC supply is still limited."
The insane growth right now is because bitcoin is in a sellers market. Tons of people who don't understand what it is want in and thus bitcoin is overvalued. It is the Tesla stock of cryptos. Eventually, the bubble is going to burst and a lot of people are gonna get hurt pretty bad. It might be in a month, a year, or a decade, but that crash is gonna come.
them btcez tho. Mad suction skills. 
with bitcoin you buy in at the start of the rally. not at the top. Just wait until it crashes and the FUD is at ATH

"Gambling: you pay a stake for a one-time (the duration of the bet, whether it be a slot machine spin or a sports game), all-or-nothing shot at a predetermined amount of money, on an event you have no influence over. You either instantly win or lose all. The only parties involved are you and the one who set out the bet (usually a casino or a broker)

Speculation: you buy an object (physical or not, crypto included) and you hope will be worth more when you sell it later. The average selling price can in- or decrease, but you will always have the object in your possession and are free to do with it as you please. You will be in direct contact with the market once you are ready to sell. "

"Debt can do a lot of harm to young people. Look at this: https://twitter.com/egoraptor/status/936163501785018370 (""Art students/graduates, how much is your current student debt?"")

There are stories about student debts on reddit every day. It's *bad* for people. Debt can bring people to depression and suicide and can bring you into a negative spiral that lasts the rest of your life. People who start educations they realise they don't really want (or which won't be able to repay their debts -- in the case of things like art school above); it would be much better for those people to restart their education doing something else, but they can't because they're already a year in (and with the corresponding debt).

I came from a family living at times from paycheck to paycheck but still finished 5 years of university debt free (and I only worked a 10% job on the side for 2 of those years). I live more than comfortably now even paying as much tax as I do, with free healthcare (and state provided unemployment insurance and retirement benefits), and I honestly vastly prefer this over entering adult life with a soul-crushing debt that perhaps has no end in sight.

But yeah, our taxes do cover at least in part roads, schools, healthcare, and college, so maybe you *should* be all over it :-)"
">>Who couldn't the NATO nations, barring America, defend themselves against?

Alright, I suppose that's technically correct based on how I worded that question, so I'll give you that. But I was kinda hoping for answers along the lines of a nation with which potential conflict might be remotely plausible, you know?

And the notion of a war between the EU and China, well, that's simply not happening. Not only is the EU China's largest trading partner, and China the EU's second largest partner after only the United States, but there's also the fact that EU spending would still eclipse that of China by a fair -if not overwhelming- amount when you equalize spending as a percentage of GDP, and that the EU is still technologically ahead of China when it comes to the production and development of military equipment.

>And the backing of North Korea if they wanted it. 

No disrespect, but that's a joke, right? "

**Edit:** Wait a minute, you're including the sales tax on the purchase of a *house* and attributing it to a single year, rather than the length of time you're going to be paying your mortgage for? 

That seems a little bit disingenuous, to be honest. Particularly in comparison to a nation which primarily relies on income tax, like the US, where most people pay approximately the same amount every year. 

Kinda like an American saying that they paid $70,000 in taxes this year, only for it to turn out that they took an advance on next year's paycheck, you know what I mean?  "
that makes sense but is irrelevant to my point, even if there's a correction I don't see unemployment skyrocketing to a point where it affects tuition payment and even if it does, it just delays the payments since the loans can't be defaulted on

Yes? I think you missed my point, which was that people are buying into BC right now when the actual value is less than what they are paying for it which will precipitate a crash. Yes, like the stock market, which is much more comparable to cryptos than currency, and yes like the housing market/car market. The trouble is that nobody is actually sure what the value of BC is. This makes it much harder to predict when the crash will happen. Bitcoin has crashed before and it was rough on people who bought at the peak. Now, if people are buying in at this moment, when the hype dies down and the price hits an equilibrium, those people will get screwed. 
I missed my chance at 0.1 to 1.0$ thinking it was too late. There was 1 chart back then. Shoot. Now I cant get 10k btc. only 1k. 5000$? Thats really good. When did you break the mental barrier tho? at 3k? Then some time to research the best way to get fiat into btc. and a week later its already 5k?
Yep. If I had a satoshi for every person who FOMO bought when it goes up and panic sold when it went down, I could probably afford the transaction fees to move the BTC I’ve accumulated in the meantime.

Yes it does. In the long term investment anyone who weathered the storm survived and ended up ahead. When Bitcoin dies there will be no sun coming up behind the clouds. It will be a defunct currency.
sort of. you don't write off losses of bitcoin, you write off losses of dollars. the gains/losses only apply to the fiat you receive when you sell. the IRS isn't taxing your crypto, it's taxing your dollars.

like any other asset
are you saying that if you held on to assets through a crash and then later, after the crash, some people were willing to pay for those assets again?  Do you think that disproves my point?
You can do that for bitcoin losses as well, if you sell at a loss.
Yes, presuming you sell at a loss. It's considered a commodity by the IRS. You can write off losses for bitcoin just as you can for gold, or any other commodity investment.
Well the IRS charges capital gains on it (hard to track, but you're supposed to), so yes?

Don't forget they said the same regarding mortgage backed loans.
Can there really be a student loan bubble if you can't default on those loans? The Mortgage bubble popped because people could no longer make payments and had to default on loans, while for student loans, the government can just garnish wages for their payments.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Bitcoin. Its future applications are extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of computing and economics most of its possible functions will go over a typical investor’s head. There’s also Sitoshis’s free market outlook, which is deftly woven into his creation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Robert Malthus, for instance. 

The shills understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of this coin, to realise that it is not just speculation - it says something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Bitcoin truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the brilliance in Satoshi’s brilliant programming method - the “Blockchain,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Haber and Stornetta's Merkle trees. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as our lord and savior's genius wit unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Bitcoin tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎"
"You absolutely can default on student loans. The default rate is currently at 11.3% In fact there's a whole sub encouraging it. r/studentloandefaulters. 

What you're likely thinking of is the difficulty of declaring bankruptcy on public student loans. It is a common meme that you can't get student loans discharged via bankruptcy, but that is not true. It is more difficult than other forms of debt though. "

Loss exceeds creation already.   Loss is absurdly huge.   At the rate of current loss, there will only be 8 million bitcoins by the time 21 million are mined.   
"And therein lies the current issue with bitcoin. The value growth in it currently  is based on speculation which in turn is due to the fact that people aren't treating it as a *currency* (which is the whole point) but as just a commodity, with speculators getting interested purely based on wanting to be able to buy low sell high. 

And now you've got companies that *did* accept it as currency, like steam, pulling out. 

I love the idea of a decentralized currency system and I especially love the idea of a decentralized currency completely outside of the realm of the nation-state to control and that protects the anonymity of its users 

But right now that's not what bitcoin is being used as. Right now it's like a Baudrillardian Hyperreality mirror image of financial products"

Psyched to see this on Facebook!
The delusion that something with no value beyond speculation will continue to gain speculative value...the rapid increase in the value of bitcoin is actually a huge turn off to companies that would want to use it as a stable currency. The value of money can’t swing hundreds of percent and expect businesses to want to take it.
"This is a wrong joke, with bitcoin the 1500% would be what you would get if you sold it, what you would get from the investment you made.

With school you get education and what increased by 1500% is the price to get education and not how smart you will become if you go to college. So the profit from wasting money with college (unlike bitcoin) didnt increased by 1500%"

My economics professor told me that he is advising everyone to stay very far away from BTC. Later I asked him why and he said “I do not know a lot about it, granted I have not done much research on it.” He has a PhD from University of Chicago in economics and is no chump. I definitely see why the charts look concerning and how this growth may not be sustained, but I believe it’s best to just stay informed and ride the wave if you’re willing. BTC was at 9k when he told everyone to stay far away.

Everyone gets mad that college cost so much but they don't want to talk about why it cost so much.  The original purpose of schooling was to educate people, not to have football teams, baseball teams, basketball teams, different clubs, multimillion-dollar Arenas. Maybe, just maybe we need to consider school is not school anymore and that's why it cost so much. remind you of anything else?  federal government anyone? the original purpose is lost as the program is overloaded and Bloated to do a million other things. As expected the cost to run it is astronomical. Js
That is why crypto's decentralization is becoming so popular as an answer to centralized institutes, schooling system belonging to them too.
"That is one of the most idiotic things I've heard.

You do realize the vast majority of college professors support at the very least lowering the cost of tuition right?

Strawman argument"
If your going to college to become a factory worker (no disrespect to those who work a 9-5 job) just to buy dollars, then your doing it wrong.
"The thing about parabolic charts is that they very rarely do a V-top.  Apple, NFLIX, Amazon have had similar chart patterns.

While the chartists are quick to tell us that bitcoin is not a stock, they then use stock principles to interpret the chart, even when V-tops are unusual.

Instead of a stock chart, what if bitcoin was following an adoption curve?  Does it end at 0.1% of financial market investments?  Does it even ""V drop"" immediately to 0.01% of financial market investments when it reaches 0.1%?"
Nothing can increase by that much and still be a good investment
"Plot twist; Professor turns around and kicks the student out of his class. Then tells the class *to always remember to factor in the inflation rate and time value of money over a 30 plus year period before you decide to be a smartass.*"

The real bubble that no one is talking about, the college debt bubble. 
My investments teacher who was a professional trader earlier in his career has been mentioning the Bitcoin price all semester long calling it a pyramid scheme and saying it’ll go to 0. One class he came in and threw all his shit down, (keep in mind the teacher is easily one of the smartest at my Uni and well reserved), and say “ok guys I don’t know anymore. We were gonna talk about retirement vehicles today but the recent price in bitcoin has me thinking otherwise.” He creates these macros on excel only a Jedi Knight could make and halfway through his lecture showing us his spreadsheet on retirement options. A student mentioned the new bitcoin ATH and he broke down and went on a tangent. “ this is what you can expect from 30 years of your 401K game here are the pessimistic and optimistic returns. But who cares about 401ks when you can make 1000+% return on your investment in bitcoin.” The man completely rekt his macro by putting in radical numbers. After getting error messages he leaned on his podium looked out into the class and exhaled and said sell securities sell bonds buy bitcoin and retire in 4-5 years” then dismissed the class.
Still even more when you take into account USD's value decreasing over time.

"I can get student loans to go to college in the US and pay them back forever.

In Europe, I have to pay for school, rent, bills, books, food, everything by myself. So I would have to get a private loan for that anyway, or work EVEN MORE than I already was.

I don't think it evens out unless you have a European relative you can live with."
Because we'd still have to pay $1000 USD/month for rent and other living costs. I looked into studying at the University of Saarbrücken for Comp Sci but the bachelor courses are in German whereas I would have better access to a job in my field if I had an American University degree. 
FYI I looked into Europe for grad school and many of the schools charged US prices (maybe a little less, but comparable) for students from North America 
false equivalency here. you hear the same reasoning when talking about universal healthcare and taxes, but in reality it would be cheaper per person to pay in taxes towards universal healthcare than into premiums for privatized insurance companies. same idea with colleges, a universal taxation system would guarantee us paying less than we do now, with the perk of providing better accessibility to everybody. in the end, a tax-based distributive approach would actually SAVE us money, in both [education](https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2016/03/01/why-college-is-so-expensive-and-how-to-fix-it/#1639ff4f252f) and [healthcare](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2017/04/20/524774195/what-country-spends-the-most-and-least-on-health-care-per-person), while providing better access to the vulnerable and poor.
Offset by the cost savings of having an educated society.
American tuition is ludicrously overpriced, that has nothing to do with taxes. The price has inflated massively without a correlating boost in quality. At least if the government paid for it they'd probably get a better deal than we do.
TIL Americans don't pay taxes.
"Don’t confuse volatility with profitability. It’s not a bad investment if you’ve invested what you can afford to lose. 

Edit: new bitcoiners... it’s not called hodling because it’s easy. We know it’s going to crash again, that’s why you dollar cost average what you can afford to lose."

"Did you see the AMA from that kid who had $1 million in bitcoin a couple months ago?

Seems he had made a deal with his parents where he could finally abandon school if he made a million before high school graduation.

Hopefully he took the advice of the thread and put some money into safer investments or he and all his failed businesses will collapse if bitcoin ever falls."

"On the other end of the spectrum, I'm paying £18,000 more than my older brother who is 2 years older than me, for the same degree at the same university.

Also my interest rate repayments are much larger than his, so that variance will likely be much higher."

"...what? More like 17k a semester. Almost every four year degree has a requirement for number of credit hours earned prior to graduation. That number hovers somewhere between 122-126 depending on what university you look at. 

Every class will grant you three or four credit hours and they usually restrict you to a minimum of 12/maximum of 17 per semester. I am fairly certain this is a commonality across all universities. They literally cannot “increase the number of classes per a degree”

I’m not advocating for the ever growing college tuition prices.. and I get that you are excited about what has been happening with Bitcoin, but don’t say stupid shit like this

Except not everyone knows about or pursues bitcoin.
"It's important to realize it's a technology. Blockchain tech is well proven on several levels. Not all. We have a scaling problem! But that is true for all investments or entrepreneurial endeavors. We wouldn't have a scaling problem if there wasn't a tremendous amount of demand for stores of value outside the US dollar. 

Imagine if you could be an angel investor in IBM when they first got started. Or windows, or Apple. Not only that you could it in a permissionless system of anonomimity. That's what Blockchain tech and Bitcoin are. "
Every investment ever is a gamble. The stock market is a gamble. Your 401k is a gamble. 
"It’s not supposed to be an investment, but a currency.  When it’s more widely accepted as payment for things (and used for payment), it will be less volatile (which I assume is what you mean by “safer”).  Problem is that (relatively) no one’s spending it on goods, just buying and holding in hopes of getting rich.  Eventually people will ask themselves “wait, what the fuck are we doing, this is nuts”, and sell off their bitcoin.  Just need to hope there are still a lot of buyers wanting to pay high prices for it when that happens.  If there aren’t, bitcoin is gonna hit a pretty bad speed bump.

Imagine if this happened with the dollar (or anything)  People just selling everything to get into dollars, because everyone else is doing it and the demand for dollars is high and they can make a lot of money.   Eventually people will want to take their profits and get out, but there needs to still be buyers willing to pay those high prices to take those dollars off their hands.  As long as there are buyers, everything’s fine.  When there aren’t many buyers willing to pay those prices (say, because something happened in the news that caused them to lose faith in dollars), lots of people will be running for the exits.  God help you if you don’t make it out in time.  "
"Most 'trades' who require college, are debt free with their own home and a family by the time they're thirty. They also know that labourers don't work 9-5 jobs and can use ""you're"" in a sentence, properly. Now cycle down to the bank and pay your student loan. Good boy!"
Crazy thing is, those jobs now require a degree. There are listings for in-home caretakers (w/housekeeping) that require degrees, and they only pay $8/hr. Few companies are willing to train an employee anymore when they can have the employee pay someone else to train the employee for them.

Although he didn't want to give us 'investment advice' his main reason for not buying BTC was that the government and banks can pretty much render it useless if they make it illegal, as it wouldn't get accepted as a valid payment method. Central banks have worked closely to governments before to the point where Draghi said he'd to everything to save the Euro, why would governments risk that by accepting BTC?"

"I'm no economist, but I find it weird that heavy deflation and huge transaction costs means you can't actually use this coin to, you know, buy things. As if any consumer is going to pay for their pizza using BTC if it might have doubled in value in a month. And if the thing is useless as a coin, what good is it?

Secondly, people keep using the phrase 'investing in BTC'. While I understand this is a common phrase, isn't this a misnomer to the extent you're just *betting* on it? It's not like you're buying stock in order to get return on equity.

"Sounds very sensible. Everyone here seem to have forgotten or simply wasn't around for the last bubble where we shot up to 1200 in a couple of months, then crashed to 400  in a few days. Then we spent almost 3 years in a bear market, going as low as 10% of the peak. 

Any investment which loses 90% of its value at any point, is generally not a good one, since you have to be very strong willed to nto be tempted to sell in such a bear market. Also, it suggests very strongly there is no real underlying value and the assset is highly speculative. 

Your professor would still not advise anyone to buy, rightfully, because he does not know when the peak will come, but he knows it will, and it will be a bloody ride down. "

"It's relatively simple. Since there is no inherent value to it, and as a currency it's.. unreliable at best, Bitcoin is a giant stock pyramid scheme. All the people that invest now and earn big bucks are doing so over the life savings of the people that lose it all when it eventually crashes.

Something to keep in mind as well. Unlike the other 2008 crash or the 2000 .com crash, if you lose all your savings when bitcoin crashes, you get no recuperation, a.f.a.i.k. "

Physics is linked in via mining & the fact that proof of work is the only proven solution to the incentive structure that maintains the bitcoin network. Information theory in a very unstrict definition, is the observation that information itself has certain properties, when combined with bitcoins transaction structure, new ways to look at said information emerges. Crytography is also related to information theory in that numbers have certain properties as well, which also serves to maintain the network. You can add finance and behavioural economics into it as well. Its no wonder it has captured the societies imagination, so many things can be projected onto it about what it actually is.
"> and that it must be because they are intelligent and understand the technology

That's not logic, thats you putting words in other people's mouths."
Only stupid people would call caution in untested waters stupid. Stupid of course does not always get punished.
Really? I think it can actually be deduced through logic. Value investors believe bitcoin is worthless. Bitcoin investors believe it is valuable. Therefore, bitcoin investors believe value investors are wrong. But how wrong? Given the current price and recent gains, bitcoin investors' beliefs have been confirmed, and that it must be because they are intelligent and understand the technology. Therefore, those who believe it has no value are also stupid. 
"I'm pretty sure there is a huge chunk of the investing world that knows. Also, what does physics have to do with this? Also, what is information ""theory."" To me, bitcoin is a speculative bubble given all the evidence. What are the advocates betting on? That somehow a deflationary virtual asset that isn't inherently linked to the valuable technology upon which it is based, will remain unregulated, will eventually be used for transactions, AND will start replacing reserve currencies... hmmmm...

What else do you call it when you have the ability to understand something that others don't? Logical conclusion. But, you can name the fallacy I'm committing if you disagree. 
yes, it is still possible.
Bitcoin is the intersection of physics, information theory, and finance. Nobody knows.

Wikipedia makes about $35mil on their last fund campaign. They don’t need it.
"IMO Wikipedia goofed by rejecting our pleas for them to accept BTC donations years ago. Every time I see that ""If everyone donated $3"" message I think to myself: No Jimmy, if only you accepted our damn bitcoin donations you wouldn't be asking us for money right now you idiot. They would have received thousands of bitcoins in donations just like Wikileaks did, but dumb-dumb was closed minded at the time. "

I was diagnosed with Crohn's disease 10 years ago (im 42 now).  I had surgery initially to remove 12 inches if my small intestines, and started Remicade afterwards.  I have been in deep remision for over 9 years now. I get Remicade drip every 8 weeks for the rest of my life or until there is a cure.  Without insurance, it would cost around $6000 / session.  With insurance, it comes out to about $900, and Remistart, a program to help Remicade patients with their costs, takes care of about 80% of those costs.   You should look into something like that for the medicine she is on if available.  
I am pursuing my own ambitions in life so I can only offer financial support now, but if you personally know any causes or would even like to open a 'pineapple animal shelter', get in touch!
it only seems that way because most of the well-known charities that are corrupt spend a huge chunk of money on marketing. I'd wager that the number of smaller, effective, non-corrupt charities vastly outnumber them. charitynavigator is a good tool

Hello! I literally made a Reddit account just for this. My buddy above^ and I started this charity because after years of handing out sandwiches to the homeless in our community we collected their feedback on what they wanted, and it was so simple it broke our hearts: a place to shower and wash our clothes. After researching some other awesome charities like LavaMae we, too, wanted to bring a shower bus to our area. As I mentioned in the application, every 300k offers us an opportunity to extend quality hygiene access to larger and larger swaths of communities. Hope you'll consider us!

"Yet another CFS/ME sufferer here. I really hope you consider the Open Medicine Foundation. Right now it's my biggest hope for figuring out this horrible illness. Thank you for what you're doing.

This illness is genuinely terrible. Some recover, whether it be by 10% or 100%, but as far as I can tell the vast majority never do, and it seems like those that do recover are never as healthy as they were before they got sick. Millions around the world have this illness and in times gone past it's been mostly ignored by the medical community as a whole. It's time to figure this out and stop the suffering. Thank you for your time."
sorry to hear that.
"Another bedbound ME/CFS patient here.

This is an excellent cause, one of the most under funded cruel and devastating diseases. It’s also been misunderstood dismissed and marginalised for years. Uk funding was ~10 million over the last 10 years compared to ~74 million for MS which has half the number of sufferers. A lot of that research in the Uk was been hijacked by psychiatrists (approx 7-8 million) who have hoovered up a lot of funding and blown it on poor research to try and promote their exercise based psych treatments which don’t work and harm patients. It’s a modern day medical scandal. Recently There has been a paradigm shift away from these treatments led by patients, Alem Matthews requested data via a FOI the university tried to vilify patients as vexatious, the court ruled these claims were unfounded and released the data paving the way for reanalysis showing that the research claims were bogus. Alem is sadly bedbound now unable to read, his mum reads him ME news and messages. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have now dropped the psych treatments CBT and GET from their list of recommended treatments for CFS/ME and NICE in the UK are reviewing their guidelines. We desperately need biomedical research and the OMF are an excellent team and likely to be our best shot at solving this quickly."

"Another ME/CFS patient here. 

Notice my username? It’s because I’ve considered doing online sex work as a last resort to avoid having to file bankruptcy— at 26 — because I got sick my last year of university and still have to pay back mountains of student debt I thought I’d be able to work full time or more to pay back. 

I was healthy until I wasn’t (never fully recovered from a flu), and I never expected I’d become disabled right out of university. Had I known this would happen to me, I would have forgone education in favour of working for those 5 years so I’d be able to access disability support. At this point I’ve never actually taken payment for sex work, because I managed to find a job I can just barely manage at 10 hours a week from home. 

Here in Canada, it’s estimated that up to 2% of our entire population could be affected by this disease, yet there is no support from our government or medical system. A large donation to the OMF could make a difference in the lives of millions of people on a global scale. 

I hope anyone reading this will understand I’ve told this story the way I have to show how difficult and desperate life with ME/CFS can get (suicide is a big killer among our patient group), not to try and gain personally from my “sob story.” Thanks!"

"Amazing, thank you for your generosity. 
Another vote for a donation to OMF.ngo from a ME/CFS sufferer. Please support them.. We patients are suffering with no help. I got sick and never got better.. lost my job, independence, apartment 4 years ago. I used to have a Director level job in NYC, and now I am too ill to leave the house, and my family takes care of me. It’s a devastating illness. You become so ill with cognitive deficits, headaches, and unrelenting debilitating weakness and fatigue. It leaves you unable to participate in life, or even care for yourself. 

OMF is an innovative foundation based in Silicon Valley. They fund work at the Stanford, and have put together a stellar team of scientists to tackle Myalgic Encephalomyelitis.  But, they need more funding to be effective. They cannot hire researchers unless they can show a runway of funding for several years work.

Sure you have a CPA advising you already but instead of selling the btc, paying tax on the huge gains, and then contributing the after tax profits, you should look into contributing the bitcoins directly in which case you'll not only be able to avoid cap gains tax, but can also take the charitable contribution on your  tax return. 
I agree this would be a great donation. Not necessarily the *best* considering other things like medical research, etc. But its a great one. OpenBSD is the best open source OS out there in my opinion. It just works and does not come with a half a dozen kitchen sinks.

Yes for MAPS here. I have cluster headaches and only reasonable cure for this disease are psychedelics and MAPS are making effort for legalizing those for medical use. It might not be legalized in decades where I live but hopefully my kids will benefit from their effort if they happen to get the same disease. http://www.maps.org/lsd-news-timeline/449-cluster-busters
"From /u/Aaron_FF below...   

Please donate to MAPS - the [Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies](http://www.maps.org/). They are conducting groundbreaking research with MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for post-traumatic stress disorder, and it is proving to be more effective than all existing treatments.

MDMA is scheduled to become prescription medicine by 2021, and psychedelic therapy more broadly is one of the most promising areas in current scientific and medical research. MAPS is the main organization spearheading the research and conducting clinical trials to get through the FDA approval process is extremely expensive.

In the longer term, psychedelic research has the potential to revolutionize the treatment of ailments like depression, anxiety and addiction, and replace the pharmaceutical industry with more affordable and effective options.

Here is their cryptocurrency donation page: https://www.maps.org/donate-redirect/cryptocurrency

"I'd also suggest GiveDirectly. I've donated to them a few times when I've been able to spare the cash (although slightly lower amounts than you're bestowing, OP!) 
They're one of the highest rated charities on GiveWell, and they take a highly evidence-based approach, undertaking detailed experiments to make sure donations are used as effectively as possible.

But my favourite aspect of GiveDirectly is that it treats charity recipients as adults. Instead of assuming a foreign-based charity knows how to come in and fix their problems, they recognise that even extremely low-income households know what is in their best interest but just require a bit of help to achieve it. They've shown some amazing results with this approach and have some really lovely case studies. 

But whatever charities you choose, you're doing an amazing thing that will really make a difference to a lot of people's lives. "
That would be a great South Park superhero.

Personally I like the [Good Food Institute](http://www.gfi.org/), one of ACE's top charities. GFI contributes to lab grown meat. When this catches on it will not only reduce animal suffering but will also be awesome for the environment and for human health. 
Yes exactly why he should convert it to real money instead of just handing out easily stolen tokens online to anyone who pops up. And its not necessarily the over time part, just that he has no idea how to effectively give away the money. Doing it in a smart manner can create a lot more good with the same amount of money

Anyway it's great you're donating your money to something constructive. The money will go so much further than if you were to spend it only on things for yourself!"

Please please please donate to SENS. I've dreamed of the day where I had enough that I could make a difference in their annual goals. They are doing VERY important research that seems to keep getting ignored.
Definitely recommend SENS!
Especially since Conservancy found itself in some serious [legal trouble](https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2017/nov/03/sflc-legal-action/), it would be great if they had funding to fight and recover from it :D

Thank you for the clarification. Go OP!
That's what she said.
Great song!
That's Jason Bourne!
This guy did the math.
"That doesn't mean he pays 86 million less in taxes. It means when determining how much he has to pay in taxes, they will say his income was 86 million less. Put another way, if you gave away half your income to charity, you would still have to pay taxes on the first half of your income, and OP will still have to pay taxes on all the dollars he exchanges his bitcoin for that are not part of those 86 million charity bound dollars.

So if OP follows through on this, that's wonderful, and an actual sacrifice."
Haha I'm sure there's a cap

Ofcourse pineapple.

"Nobody wants money. Money is either something you exchange for something else you want, or a status symbol and power over those who have not. It's not an end-goal in itself.

What do you want in life? Most people fail to answer that question because whatever the answer is they haven't enough money to achieve it, so they seek money and put off asking those questions. Maybe that's what you mean?

I'd suggest sitting down and really sorting out what you want to accomplish, what makes you happy, and what would be a life worth having lived. Like 99% of the people out there, you will find that the answers to these questions require resources you don't have, and the near-term solution is to work longer, invest more, and generally make more money. But unless you have a weird (and sad) money-counting fetish, I suspect mere accumulation of money is not the driving purpose in your life, or the lives of the 99%.

Most people want security for themselves and their family -- meaning a house that's theirs and food on the table, indefinitely. Good health. Time to spend with their family and friends, or doing hobbies they enjoy. Obviously money buys time, security, and the consumables of life. Many people, though sadly not most, want a purpose or cause to work for, and money gives them both the time to work towards that, and the leverage to achieve it. But none of these motivations are for money for money's sake. If that's what you're chasing, I suggest you take some time off to consider what you're doing with your life and why."
It's amazing someone would donate 102 million to a good cause. We should all aspire to be pineapple lovers 
Uh. That's not how charities are supposed to work.
Yeah seems like it was written by an amateur. At the end of they day, they're ad free and have been for so long that even if they're 2x 3x over what they actually need, I personally don't care because they deserve it. 
"Same.

You getting to set the pace is amazing. I did a review on quite a lot of calculus and passed all my exams thanks to it"

"Among the medical-focused organizations, I'll stick in a plug for The [Cystic Fibrosis Foundation](https://www.cff.org/) (CFF), who I also recommended in the other charity post.

They gather funds to support research for finding a cure for the ~70,000 individuals struggling with Cystic Fibrosis worldwide.

The Foundation itself has been recognized as one of the few medical-treatment-focused charities that's actually seen new drugs and treatments come to market because of their funding that have significantly extended the lives of those patients they're seeking to help. That's due in large part to the way they've been managing their donation money; most organizations focused on curing a specific medical issue offer bounties in the form of ""if you create a cure, we'll give you X dollars"", but that places all the risk on the pharmaceutical companies themselves (if they do all the research and come up with nothing, it's their loss). CFF instead does more with ""If you are doing active research on a cure for CF, we'll pay you Y dollars/year"", which shares the risk with the foundation itself. 

Because of that, the foundation has much more insight into drugs that are in various stages of readiness (not just the drugs that are past clinical trials), and leads to a [pretty full pipeline](https://www.cff.org/Trials/Pipeline) of promising drugs.

In the interest of full disclosure, I do have a bias towards CFF because I have a family member with CF."
I hope you kept some for yourself and your family too. No one knows what the future holds.
fun fact: that tenderness is actually from a flesh-eating enzyme found in pineapple juice :P
Thank you so much! OpenBSD really deserves the support. :D
"I'm not sure if you're stilling reading comments on this thread, but I thought I would recommend a charity that I and my family support. 
The Foundation Fighting Blindness supports a very worthy cause and would greatly appreciate any donation. http://www.blindness.org/"
One think that gets over looks like crazy is the NIHs research on Antibiotics. Infectious diseases kill far more people than wars and natural disasters. Antibiotic resistance is a serious threat to Mankind and is under funded. The NIH needs all the help it can get. Also donating money to get syringe exchange programs in Tampa/saint pete. I've always wanted to start one. I'm a public health major. 
Sure you have a CPA advising you already but instead of selling the btc, paying tax on the huge gains, and then contributing the after tax profits, you should look into contributing the bitcoins directly in which case you'll not only be able to avoid cap gains tax, but can also take the charitable contribution on your  tax return. 
You are amazing! Have you thought about putting your money in the stock market and donating the dividends? That way you can donate forever!
"Hey man, any chance you could throw something this way:

https://sfconservancy.org

Those organizations make sure our free and open source software stays that way and fighting against multibillion dollar corporations is not easy task.

So how much did you make total?
"Please consider the EFF as well: https://www.eff.org/

They're doing great work in making just about everything else we do possible. "

[Animal Charity Evaluators](https://animalcharityevaluators.org/donation-advice/recommended-charities/)is doing the same thing for animals charities. These charities make a difference for millions of individuals!
"1. I'd also rise my support for Effective Altruism. They are very smart people on the planet thinking about how to help people. It was founded on ideas by Robin Hanson and eg. Peter Singer has endorsed it. I think anyone who logically starts to think how to help people will end up something like Effective Altruism. The main idea behind EA is that most charities exist because people want to help but or completely uninterested in EFFECTIVENESS of the charities. When you actually start to rank them, demand RCT's and stuff like that. 
https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities

2. I'd also second MAPS.org. They are doing great work on mental health treating PTSD victims, cancer patient mental health etc: http://www.maps.org/research.

3. Donate to end animal suffering. I'm not even animal activist but on intellectual level I appreciate the work they do: https://animalcharityevaluators.org/donation-advice/recommended-charities/

4. Medical research. Horrible diseases that cannot be cured. Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, ALS, Huntington's, Creutzfelt-Jakob disease, cancer, autoimmune diseases and 10 other diseases nobody knows about. Very few of them accept bitcoin I think.
http://effective-altruism.com/ea/1d3/medical_research_cancer_is_hugely_overfunded/
http://medicalresearchcharities.org/charities/

5. EFF would be nice too. I'd like for Internet to stay free like it is. We take lots of good things about internet for granted. Don't assume it lasts. https://www.eff.org/

6. Bill Gates + Melinda foundation against malaria etc. (they already have lots of money though):
https://www.gatesfoundation.org/

7. Open science: https://cos.io/ I think open science is an important project. As long as all science is open, it is only a matter of debate and finding right people.

9. Well FLI does work on existential risks to humanity (eg. climate change): https://futureoflife.org/

10. ALLFED is an organization that support work on securing food supply in case of nuclear war, asteroid impact, supervolcano eruption etc. I have once read paper that securing food supplies for future generations would save more epected lives than all developed nations charity combined. http://allfed.info/

11. Maybe MIRI. They just do research to help keep future AI safe. They accept Bitcoin. https://intelligence.org/

12. Donate to: https://80000hours.org/
They help people find a career which let people have great impact on their life on the world. I don't know if they need money though.

13. Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page

14. There are lots of open source projects (eg. Linux foundation) who would probably need more money but given that the effect on human welfare is close to nil I am not going to recommend any. I think it would be easier to start a foundation for ""unfunded open source projects of importance"" and donate to them. For example EA uses criteria of: important, neglected, tractable.

15. I'm going to be devil's advocate and say politics. Usually only the government has the coordination and money to do something about and electing smart people is way to go. I am not going to say who or what to support. What is your goal here? Reduce suffering? Lots of things to do on health care, sanitation, infrastructure, education, basic research etc. Support candidates with science-background to be honest. I think if something that should be defended is reason and Enlightenment against populism. The candidate which I would support in US would be different I would support in Sweden.

16. The truth is that efficient charity is really hard. First of all, what is your goal? To end suffering? Well probably most of suffering is in developing world? How do you quantify it? What is the most effective approach? How about future lives? How about existential risks? Does that charity ever reach its goal? Opportunity costs? EA answers these questions quite well but the same kind of scrutiny does not usually exist outside EA supported charities (because the value of helping say people with rare disease is much smaller than helping the real poor in Africa).

p.s. I am not affiliated officially with any of the organizations but I know (as internet acquittance) some people from some of the organizations."
"It's extraordinary really. The dollars/lives saved figures are real, and based on the rigorous data charities like AMF collect about their work. Just trying to get your head around the fact is difficult... Like, there are kids out there walking around right now, and whether or not they live past childhood depends on individual donations.


Picture a hundred people in front of you - in expectation, a million dollars would save hundreds of people's lives. That's an absolutely mindblowing positive impact on the world.


OP, if you're reading this, please please look through the links in the above comments. And I'd recommend anyone else who sees this does too. The sums of money involved mean that anyone can get into effective altruism. I know we get desensitized to charity pleas, but this is the real deal, and it's a chance to literally save lives, and arguably bring more good to mankind than most people accomplish in their whole lives."
This is what he's trying to use us for. 
"Exactly. I really hope OP spoke with a tax accountant and estate attorney (who specializes in charitable trusts/foundation's) before putting any of this through.

Avoiding a ton of tax on all of that gain is the tip of the iceberg.

I'll copy and paste something I wrote elsewhere recently:

""The very wealthy can get more benefit from their charitable aspirations though. My favorite strategy is this:

* Place highly appreciated assets into an Charitable Remainder Trust (CRT). Maybe you own $10m of Bitcoin and you originally paid $25,000.

* You receive a huge tax deduction that can be carried forward. You also avoid paying tax on all the gain those appreciated assets had.

* You receive income from the trust as long as you are alive. This can be setup in a few different ways, but is often 5% of the value of the trust.

* At your death, the remaining assets are given to a charity that you had chosen.

* Funny thing is, you designate a foundation. A foundation that is formed at your death.

* This foundation's purpose is to monetarily support a cause (e.g. a foundation that awards a scholarship annually for low-income students interested in programming).

* Your offspring manage this foundation, drawing salaries (finance, accounting, attorney work etc.). Foundation's are generally required to output 5% of their assets annually to support their cause. These salaries eat into that 5%.

That's a whole lot of benefit. It's kind of fucked up how many crazy opportunities open up when you have a lot of money.""

Now, the main problem that strategy is that the charities don't see benefit until you pass away. Really, you could just give part of your income to charity each year. Or, you could just put 50%/etc. toward the remainder trust instead of the whole thing and the rest could go into your foundation right now. You could then start giving how you want now with the foundation, while receiving income to live off of from the remainder trust which will eventually pay a huge sum to your existing foundation.

Lots of possibilities."

This is a serious response. I'll reach out directly as well.

I volunteered 4 years of my youth to a non-profit organization that has effectively helped to jumpstart a revolution in education, but as soon as they turned into a for-profit company, I left for a sales position at a reputable company. That was several years ago.

"If you want to donate to someone who's on the cutting edge of a new frontier in the biomedical sciences, look into Michael Levin at Tufts University, and his Institute for Regenerative Biology at Tufts.

He's a computer scientist that did his PhD in Developmental Biology at Harvard. He looks for top down mechanisms of control regarding morphology and development that can be used in regenerative medicine. His findings regarding the role of membrane voltage outside the nervous system will rewrite text books in a few years, as well as many other major topics, like mechanisms of biological memory. He does every level of analysis important in a scientific, he doesn't just publish the results of experiments, he develops mathematical models, explores the philosophical significance, pushes new theoretical foundations and promotes new ways to do science. If you want to get a sense of what topics he's interested in, check out his recommended books page in his resources section, or just skim the titles of his publications. 

A real world application: he's shown that cancer, which is often A failure of patterning, can be corrected by modulating the membrane voltage of cancer cells. No genetic interventions or toxic treatments necessary, just some ion channel drugs applied in the right place. 

I've corresponded with him on a few ocassions and I'd be more than happy to assist in the process of dontating to him / the institute of regenerative biology, should you choose to.

"It is great to hear you are interested in supporting our friends at the SENS Research Foundation, such a generous thing to do at an ideal time of year too. Thank you so much for helping them out. I honestly could not think of a greater gift to give someone than their health, because health is the greatest wealth of all I believe, and it seems you agree :)

I am Steve Hill from the US charity LEAF (www.leafscience.org) and we support the work of SENS and other researchers of aging through news, advocacy, outreach, education, and crowdfunding for research. The SRF is a brilliant cause to support and Happy Holidays to you! 

And it was nice of /u/Jay27 to mention us alongside SENS. 

"
"Dear PineappleFund,

If you support [SENS](http://www.sens.org/), then you will also support [LEAF Science](https://www.leafscience.org/).

Talk to Steve Hill about it. His Facebook is: https://www.facebook.com/steve.hill.560.

His Reddit user is /u/jansen1975.

I support both SENS as well as LEAF Science. I'm not here to convince you of how to split your Bitcoin between them.

I just want to emphasize the following:

Depending on the size of your contribution, you might very well help bring the cure for aging a couple of days/weeks/months/years closer.

For every single day that your donation brings it closer, you will save 100,000 human lives.

Because that's how many people die from aging every day.

Aging is the world's most important problem, because it creates the greatest amount of grief.

There is no more efficient way of donating your Bitcoins in terms of decreasing world suck, than to donate it to life extension research.

You are in the unique position of:

- holding lots of Bitcoins
- supporting life extension
- willing to donate to life extension research

Make no mistake. No other person on this planet is currently wielding as much power as you are.

There has never been a greater technophilanthropic anywhere on this planet, in the entire history of mankind.

Donate to life extension research and you shall become the unsung hero of the 21st century.

Sincerely,

Jay"

"your selflessness act is beyond words, very cool dude!

SENS has consistently said their only major roadblock to their medical research progress is funding.  They're on a $4 mil a year shoestring budget.  This would be amazing if sens got a shot in the arm funding wise.  
"This is Dr. Aubrey de Grey, SENS Research Foundations chief science officer; see more about me here:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aubrey_de_Grey

Having myself donated most of my personal wealth to the Foundation after I inherited it in 2011, I want firstly to echo the admiration of this donor that so many here have expressed. Since that money ran out a year ago, we have indeed been gruesomely short of funds (in spite of the wonderful contributions, large and small, from donors new and old), so I can strongly confirm that any donation from the Pineapple Fund will make a massive difference. I can be emailed at any time at aubrey@sens.org to answer any questions relating to this. I will also email contact@pineapplefund.org as suggested. Thank you again for this fantastic generosity.

"oh wow, i actually follow you around in reddit's insular cryptoverse, as you're a treasure trove of insight imho! now that i've just stumbled upon this comment of yours...damn! hope you're okay, bud :/

I can third this recommendation OP.  I suffer the same condition as these 2 posters and they speak the truth of what it is like.  I love bitcoin too, and I commend you for all the charity work you are doing with your bitcoins.  Cheers to OP and my fellow ME/CFS bitcoiners.
That's actually such a smart analogy hahaha
"It would be a ""generic med"" in the same sense that antibiotics are. A given antibiotic targets a specific class of microbes, and each variant of DRACO would target a specific class of viruses, but in both cases these classes span multiple disease agents. They're likely both to be medications available only be prescription for similar reasons. (DRACO-resistant viruses can and will develop, although many diseases are likely to be eradicated entirely, so making these sorts of antivirals available over the counter would be asking for long-term trouble.)

Why is big pharma not putting money into this? Because it is insanely more profitable to sell treatment regimens that lessen symptoms and extend life expectancy rather than fix the underlying problem. This is not conspiracy but simple plain-as-day fact: the revenue that could be generated by curing a disease is pennies compared to the opportunity cost given up when there is a once-a-day antiviral regimen that keeps it at bay instead, at $10's of dollars or more per-patient, per-day. Profit-driven research labs just don't do the research."

"Can I ask why are you donating to charities and not, IDK, making projects that you would like to exists? Have you consider other alternatives to donate / invest that money or just charities?

Note: I understand that donating to charities is probably easier than to change BTC for dollars because of taxes, accounting, etc. and easier than to be in charge of a project. So maybe those are good reasons.

Note2: I'm from a 3rd world country so I don't have a lot of ""charity culture"". I feel like that's strong in USA so maybe because I'm not used to it I see it as a strange thing."

"How about the Syrian American Medical Society? They provide a wide range of medical care within and around Syria for those affected by the war. The situation has been and still is desperate for countless innocent people in Syria.

I traveled to Syria before the war and couchsurfed with a guy in Aleppo who I still keep in touch with. His family made it safely to Turkey, but his brother is an MD and would travel into Aleppo during heavy fighting to provide medical care. There was a time when the city was surrounded and everyone feared a civilian massacre. Turns out he was actually behind enemy lines and all of us were terrified he would be killed. He somehow made it back to Turkey safely.

This guy was super fortunate to have made it out of Aleppo with his family (I mean what else matters in life?), only to risk his life and the financial stability of his family to selflessly help those in the most dire situation. He was working for SAMS during all of this. I had never donated anything in my life but after learning about all of this, I now give regularly and without hesitation. I met a ton of Syrians as a solo backpacker in their country and EVERY SINGLE PERSON treated me with a level of hospitality that blew me away. I like to think that my modest donations have helped at least one of those people or their loved ones.

I just jointed reddit after lurching this subreddit for a while. Wasn’t sure what my first comment or post would be until I saw this. Thanks for reading."
"My wife has Crohns disease, an auto immune disorder where the body attacks itself throughout the entire digestive tract. It is non-curable, only treatment and management of the symptoms can be done. In 3rd world countries (like where we are) the cost of medicine in order to keep her in remission is outrageous and that is where a lot of our money goes to in order to keep her well. If there are charities or donations towards Crohns or auto immune diseases that can help to produce biologics and medicine to then sell at a lower price then that would be an amazing donation. 

Started investing any extra money into cryptocurrency to make gains so not worry about buying medicine again in the future for her, and also to go above that and try make enough money to purchase a house for us where we can  be close to a hospital for her. All proving very difficult with the expense of medicine though. 

Well done to you! :)  "

"Effective altruism is a movement that is aimed to find, evaluate and support most effective charities. Effectiveness of different non-profits varies on a scale of several orders of magnitude, so a choice of charity may be more important than it may seem. I suggest you look at some of their recommendations. I personally like [GiveWell](https://www.givewell.org/). Cost-effectiveness of top charities for saving 1 life is estimated to be ~$200-$4000. So, about a grand for a life.

Edit: thanks for ~ ~~0.5~~ ~~1.1~~ 1.4 human×years in reddit gold equivalent!"
I ❤️ philanthropy- thanks for being one of the good ones!
$86 million in bitcoin. It's almost unbelievable that someone could be donating $97 million in bitcoin. Your generosity is immense for donating $73 million in bitcoin.
Best (software-related) donation would be to the [OpenBSD](https://www.openbsd.org/) project. Most people don't realize how much they do for cryptography and open-source software.
"Question!

Why call it “The Pineapple Fund”? "
"I'd like to also strongly recommend Effective Altruism when donating. As mentioned, the organisation GiveWell produces rigorous, quantitative analyses of charities in order to determine which of them do the very most good per dollar.

The very top charities they recommend could be hundreds, or possibly thousands, of times more effective than others - so your donations could go so much further!

SENS Foundation could use some funds. They are an anti-aging research company focusing on cellular biology. Google Calico is doing something similar, but I doubt Google needs the money.

"Hi, I'll try to get in contact with the local shelters I'm about to mention and get them to apply, but first I'd like to give them a signal boost here, just in case you see it. :) 

The first shelter I'm going to mention is RescueCats (http://www.rescuecats.org/home.aspx). This is where me and my boyfriend got both of our sweet babies. They're a no-kill charity that (contrary to their name) saves both cats and dogs. In addition to taking in shelter overflow. they take in animals that most county shelters would simply consider putting down, ones with life-long diseases like our cats have. Even if their cats never get adopted, they keep them. Nox and Muffin, our cats we adopted, are FIV+, which is feline HIV. Please consider giving even a little to these awesome people. They're not very good technologically, their website is crap and their FB is hilariously non-marketable, but the group is just a bunch of sweet older-people who are just trying to do the best they can to make a difference. In addition to this, if you know someone who is good with website design, they've asked for a volunteer to re-design their website. Here's their FB if you wanted to get in contact with them: https://m.facebook.com/rescuecats.inc/?tsid=0.014401316697298272&source=result
 
They tend to answer FB messages fastest. :)

The second shelter I'm going to try and put out there, is the Georgia House Rabbit Society (https://www.houserabbitga.com). I actually volunteer here fairly regularly- they're amazing folks. In addition to being a no-kill rabbit shelter, we've also rescued birds, squirrels, and guinea pigs. We're in the process of trying to build a larger facility (because our place is basically a house that we've done our best to convert), but things are always tight at the shelter. We take in so much overflow, as well as being called out to catch rabbits that people have reported, and we take in big rabbit dumps (I think the largest we've ever taken in at once was the Big Tree dump, it was like 40-something rabbits found by a creek, but Jen, the shelter manager, would know for sure). Our shelter is constantly full, but we take as many buns in as possible. Sometimes we barely have walking room, haha.

I know that a lot of people think that rabbits can live in the wild, but that's simply not true. There's the north american cottontail, which is the non-domesticated breed of rabbit, which is fine in the wild. Then there's basically everyone else. There's a lot of misinformation about rabbits out there (that carrots are good for them is probably the biggest), but buns are as sweet and kind an animal as any cat or dog, and bunnies deserve the same recognition as friends that we bestow upon other pets.

I'm not sure if you'll see this, but if you do, please consider helping these shelters out. Also, if you're considering giving to your own local shelters, please don't try to do so through the HUSA (Humane Society of the United States). Only 1% of their donations go to the local shelter that bear a similar name (Humane Society of Cherokee County, etc.). Just donating straight to the local shelter is typically the best option.

Thank you so much for any consideration you've given to these places, and congratulations to you for hodling long enough to make it this big. :)"

I highly would recommend donating to http://www.umdf.org its for Mitochondrial Diseases something I have and deal with on a daily basis and although my case isnt as bad as a lot of other people, it really takes a toll on the average persons daily tasks. Not a lot of research happens for this stuff cause not alot money goes towards as other stuff and its also really hard to figure out ( or thats what ive understood from my doctors. )

"Please fund DRACO research.

**\#EndTheVirus**

*Some history:* before the antibiotic was discovered, bacterial infections were usually a death sentence. People with syphilis would die horrible painful deaths, and things like the Bubonic Plague spread like wildfire unstoppably killing masses of people.

Then the antibiotic was discovered, and now most bacterial infections are easily treatable with a regimen of pills or a shot.

BUT viral infections STILL have no cure.

Whether it be the common cold, or herpes or HIV, we can only treat the symptoms, and not actually cure the body.

BUT DRACO changes all of this.

It is the ANTIBIOTIC to viruses.

In short, it can induce cell-apoptosis on all cells with double-stranded RNA (which is produced ONLY by viruses, and is NOT normally produced by cells not infected with a virus).

This has the potential to cure ANY virus-caused disease, whether it be the common cold, or even HIV.

**tl;dr: bacterial infections were ended by the antibiotic. DRACO can bring an end to virus infections.**

In my opinion, this is possibly the MOST GROUND-BREAKING recent discovery in the medical field.

However, they are getting [barely any funding](http://www.process.org/discept/2011/11/17/draco-death-to-the-virus/)

> We’ve really struggled along for the past 11 years, barely getting enough funding to stay alive.

"We are many here that ask for some sort of medical research. I could ask pineapple fund to donate to cdg-research, as I'm living close to that one.

But I think it's more fitting with anything in brain-research. It harder to raise money there than say cancer. No fully working kids that suddenly get sick and either die or survive. Just people who live damaged for there entire lifes disabled with things like epilepsy and other hard to understand symptoms. Usually it communication (in the body) which in my mind fit blockchain.


Another idea is to fund reaserch tools, programs that can make science better and faster. IT way to do research. If you find a company you could buy stock to keep them going at such good projects."

"Hi!

Can I recommend the Internet Archive? (archive.org)

Among other things the Archive hosts the Wayback Machine, which is of infinite value generally speaking as a cultural history of the web, but in the recent political climate has also been a mechanism for preserving an invaluable record some are trying to redact.

Beyond the famous Wayback Machine,

 the Archive (a California library) is also involved in massive-scale book scanning and lending, both with Open Library and the current Open Libraries initiative to bring _all_ libraries onine;

the TV News project, recording and making searchable television news from dozens of markets and countries 24/7,  making television news a citable medium and subjecting it to large scale analysis, e.g. to track the appearance of political advertisements as they flow through different markets;

the Great 78s and other music projects including hosting eTree, the passionate live music taper community, including about every known recording of bands like the Grateful Dead, as well as many net labels, podcasts, etc.,

and on and on.

Additionally the Archive is an ally of the EFF and has been at the forefront of supporting the decentralized and open internet.

The Archive is a non-profit entirely supported by donations, including from individuals.

Source: employee! It's also a great place to work. :D"

Donors Choose: Does not need a large amount like above.....(https://www.donorschoose.org/we-teach/3467954?projects=true) ...but a much smaller amount could go a long way...My wife works at an extreme poverty elementary school where many of the kids don't have coats for the winter, barely get fed over the weekends, and aren't sent to school with any supplies. Also, she coaches the girl's varsity high school swim team in the same district. She just led them to their first conference title in 21 years...the team's reward??? The school is cutting their funding to bare bones next year. So now the girls are expected to buy their own suits, equipment, etc....meanwhile the football team and basketball team get their funding increased....any way, I know it is a long shot, but either a small donation to her directly through Donors Choose would help a lot (we spend up to 1k a year sometimes to just help out her kids, plus now the extra $ the girls team has to spend)...or a broad donation just to the Donors Choose site itself will help a lot of teachers in tough areas across the country.

I would highly encourage you to take a look at this foundation. 

I think it's something that can really benefit mankind and reduce suffering. If you ignore the immortality, the core of the research is to remove the suffering of ageing not actually stop it. But one of the side effects of curing diseases associated with ageing is that you tend to live longer.

"Please donate to the excellent researchers that are researching chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), a relatively common life-destroying illness that strikes young people for which until recently, very little research funding was allocated by funding bodies like the US National Institutes of Health. 

To put it into perspective, until recently the NIH allocated about $5 million per annuum to this illness for the last 20 years, which is peanuts. Compared to CFS, there are about half as many people with multiple sclerosis, and the disease has a similar suffering and disability profile, and gets about $100 million per annuum. In other words, the ratio of dollars spent per patient is shockingly low.

The good news is, there is new awareness about the illness (see the documentary [Unrest](https://www.unrest.film/) for example). The [NIH very recently also opened up CFS research centers](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-announces-centers-myalgic-encephalomyelitis-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-research) and other countries are also showing signs of wanting to solve this problem.

Unfortunately, the research funding continues to be too low to make any real progress. The current system in place works well for diseases that are somewhat understood (you need funding to make progress, and results to get funding, and it's hard to get results with a poorly understood illness while having too little funding, and researchers tend to go where the funding is, etc.). What we need is to give this research a push with an infusion of money. If you could donate a million or more it would help tremendously. Many patients are already donating but there's only so much sick and disabled people can do.

I can recommend several excellent research teams that will use donations wisely:

The [Open Medicine Foundation](https://www.omf.ngo/).

The [Cornell Center for Enervating NeuroImmune Disease](http://neuroimmune.cornell.edu/).

The [Columbia Center for Infection and Immunity](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/research/center-infection-and-immunity)(specify that the donation is for CFS).

"Awesome man(woman)! Great work, if I can make a suggestion because I don't have millions of $ yet. Try to make a difference in your own backyard. Look at helping some of the homeless population or see if you can get the ball rolling on whatever is closest to your heart & your geographical location.

I'm not super well off, but definitely not homeless. There isn't a greater feeling to me than helping / trying to help people that can't even afford a sleeping bag or a pillow. 

Don't forget the majority of these folks that are homeless have mental illness, some don't of course. But I know where I'm from over the last 20 years they have drastically defunded mental illness rehabilitation and closed down many hospitals. Those people are forced onto the streets & then they are forced into the drug cycle. It's sad, we often forget those affected around us.

Keep up the awesome work!

"If this is no BS which it sounds like it isnt.  Many people in the world can learn how to be a decent human being from you.

"Hi there. This is incredibly generous of you. I foolishly sold my btc for what now looks like a hilariously paltry sum a few years ago. This is an incredible idea and I'm sure many people will benefit. 


I was going to suggest a donation to the Open Medicine Foundation (OMF). OMF is working to develop a cure for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, a misunderstood disease that affects an estimated 17 million people and often leaves them unable to work. 25% of those people are so sick they're unable to leave their bed. 


This time last year, I was working a full time job, recently having completed a purchase of my first property, going to the gym 3/4 times a week, and generally enjoying life. Then I caught a virus which I never recovered from. Fast forward to now, and I've been living with my parents since then, who are my primary carers. I rely on them to cook for me, help take me to doctors appointments, and help me with going up and down stairs. 


The reason I have to rely on my parents for this, is because I suffer from an extreme feeling of illness all day. Imagine having the flu, but constantly, day after day, month after month. In addition, I get dizzy if I sit upright, feel more sick if I spend too long doing cognitively 'complicated' things like watching tv or reading. My muscles are severely weak, and I get frequent joint paint. I have to rest, with no stimulus, for hours every day, to even be able to be on speaking terms with my parents. When people visit they're surprised to see me able to talk and seem 'normal', but what they don't see is that after they leave I feel horrifically ill as a consequence. 


My story is not unusual among those with this disease. We are, by and large, left alone by the medical profession and left to fend for ourselves, with a poor prognosis and scant hope of recovery. There is no universally suitable or effective treatment. OMF relies on charitable donations to survive, and has assembled a world-class teams of scientists to cure this horrific illness. 

All the best to you, and I hope you consider them as a worthy beneficiary of your donation. 

Edit: added the OMF bitcoin donation page: [https://www.omf.ngo/donate-by-bitcoin/](https://www.omf.ngo/donate-by-bitcoin/)"
"Great initiative. In fact it is my hope for more super wealthy individuals to come forward bootstrapping science, research, humanitarian development etc where necessary. And I have more hope on us nerds than the super wealthy from the old age :-)

Here's my suggestions:

**1) [Machine intelligence research Institute](https://intelligence.org/research/)** 

If you are not already mixed up between euphoria and existencial terror regarding AI, I'd suggest you to read [this](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html) essay. In fact, I'd prefer you to check out that essay instead of further reading this post, if you have to choose. It had a similarly huge impact on me as when I first dived into Bitcoin.

**2) [Parsemus Foundation](https://www.parsemus.org/)**

Medical research, their project with the most attention being a cheap longterm reversible male contraception. If humanity survives 1) we'll need this soon :-)

**3) ""Opensource CPU and Hardware""**

Sorry no link, maybe someone can chime in here. Intel and AMD CPUs contain microcontrollers with closed source software and access to memory, data and networking interfaces. An can't safely and securely be deactivated. As we need open source operation systems and software, we need open source hardware too. It's a disaster waiting to happen, and maybe alreay happening behind closed doors for years. There's [Talos](https://www.crowdsupply.com/raptor-computing-systems/talos-secure-workstation) building a POWER8 open hardware computer, but I don't know what state they are at nor if they are an NGO or ""just"" a for-profit company. I'd consider this a first-world luxury problem, compared to 1) and 2) though.

**4) [The PENG! collective]( https://pen.gg/campaigns)**

They use clever media campaigns to fight the big guys. Like for example

* staging a peace prize ceremony for one of the biggest weapons exporters

* getting into a young-researchers competition by Shell, then ""exploding"" their machine live on stage spilling oil everywhere, shutting down the complete competition

* dropping flyers over NSA headquarters, billboards in view of the bureaus with ""intel exit""

and a dozen more. It easily takes 6 months and more to prepare for those campaigns. I am in awe of their clever and funny campaigns, and how they engage right at the biggest supercorporations, national states and intelligence agencies. They are not exactly saving humanity as a whole, but work on making world a bit less evil. I think a donation with a fraction of your regular donations would help them out big time already.

Well, what more can I say than ""thank you for doing your part"". :-)"
TOR, MAPS, Wikipedia, Wikileaks, Drug Policy Alliance, The Water Project are just a few places that would be nice to donate to :)

"I'm sure you're seeing all kinds of posts about charities, so I'll add mine here as well. 

I recently left my New York City job as a software engineer at Yahoo to CoFound a small startup with one of my best friends in my local community. We started out giving food to the homeless every day, but we have a dream of creating the very first shower bus on the east coast. 

Our goal is that we can use this bus to provide free hygiene, first aid, haircuts, and health services to our local community. If the homeless don't appear different than anyone else, than they won't be. 

We only need about 300,000 to retrofit the bus, we just ran our first successful fundraiser earlier this year after becoming a 501(c)(3). 

I've been following the Bitcoin community forever but have always been too cowardly to invest myself. 

We've submitted an application to the Pineapple  Fund. If you were willing to support our mission I would be incredibly grateful, and the underserved homeless community of New Jersey would appreciate your sacrifice. 

You can find more info about the mission here: https://ArmNewBrunswick.org 

Whether you choose to support us or not, thank you for doing this. You're making the world better.

"First of all thank you! The contribution to the EFF is awesome. Since privacy is under attack globally more donations to FOSS organizations with a focus on privacy and security can go a long way for mainstream citizens. One recommendation I have would be to donate to OpenWhisper Systems. 

Moxie and team have been changing our secure communications for the better over the years and I would love to see a large boost in development around both the Signal protocol and Noise protocol framework. We all win with open privacy technology of the like! 

Thanks again for your generosity.

Gentleman! Bless you man. 
"Please donate to MAPS - the [Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies](http://www.maps.org/). They are conducting groundbreaking research with MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for post-traumatic stress disorder, and it is proving to be more effective than all existing treatments.

MDMA is scheduled to become prescription medicine by 2021, and psychedelic therapy more broadly is one of the most promising areas in current scientific and medical research. MAPS is the main organization spearheading the research and conducting clinical trials to get through the FDA approval process is extremely expensive.

In the longer term, psychedelic research has the potential to revolutionize the treatment of ailments like depression, anxiety and addiction, and replace the pharmaceutical industry with more affordable and effective options.

"Why are you donating to charities? Do you know how corrupt most charities are?
Only a kid without real world knowledge would have such a novel dumb idea. But it's ok, you don't want to go to the bank? I'm sure the charities CEO's will have a riot with your donations."
I'm just impressed with your generosity, cheers.
"Donate to the End ME/CFS Project.

A terrible crippling disease with not nearly enough funding effecting millions globally."
The Hotspot Community Resource Centre in Squamish, BC (canada) is a small non-profit that provides a lot of community resources. One of the best parts in my opinion is they rebuild donated computers that would otherwise be garbage and sell them to the community for next to nothing ($20-$40 gets you a perfectly useable machine running ubuntu with mouse, keyboard and monitor) They also put on kids programming workshops etc. https://seatoskycommunity.org/donate/

"An amazing thing you are doing, I am sure you will help a lot of people and get a lot of satisfaction from doing it.

There are many worthwhile causes already mentioned but if I had to vote it would be a very general one; medical research.

The amount of cringe in this thread is probably as expected. Many people are subtly asking for your bitcoin through their stories of unverifiable misery - please don't fall for it. It's a slippery slope.

I do apologise to anybody who is being sincere and has no intent to beg, as there are some very tragic events mentioned here - but in a thread like this it does come across as 'beggy'."

"Hiya, thank you for your generosity, it could make an enormous difference to many lives.

I would like to suggest the OMF Foundation which is researching into CFS/ME.

CFS/ME is a life destroying illness which has been ignored my the medical establishment for decades.

To find the cause/causes, and get a treatment, or maybe even a cure would be like a miracle for so many of us.

I'm sure there are others who could word this much better than can atm, but I felt I had to give it my best shot.

Thanks again.

1. https://www.libreoffice.org/ - Office Suite that has been forked from OpenOffice when Sun acquired Oracle

1. https://ardour.org/ - open source cross-platform DAW

1. https://www.blender.org/ - probably everyone knows blender already (if not, it's 3D graphics suite), so I think they are doing pretty well, but yeah, great project

1. https://www.gimp.org/, https://krita.org/ and https://inkscape.org - for different kinds of 2d graphics

1. https://donate.mozilla.org/ - probably even more known than blender, they are really doing great job.

1. https://sfconservancy.org/projects/current/- charity that takes care of multiple open source projects.

That's just from the top of my head, there's a lot more projects that would need help, if anything else comes to my mind, I'll keep adding it here.

Why not donate to local clinics, mine saved my ass. I was scared shitless when i got sick and the clinic took care of be and gave me subsidised care.
Wow! I hope someone donates bitcoin to me! it'll put me out of debt. No Lambo's for me.
May I suggest Shriner-Burns Children's Hospital for children with birth defects and cancer? Also Texas Children's Hospital is a worthy endeavour. 
Please donate towards groups like [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/donate) that are revolutionizing education.  Having better, cheaper, scalable education is needed to solve all problems. 
I volunteered for a charity and was saddened to see the amount of donated money that was going to scammers (people who were applying for help using multiple fake identities). I hope you can somehow personally supervise the use of at least some of your donations to ensure they are being well spent.  
My friend runs Philadelphia Community Corps a nonprofit that helps salvage things from ruined and blighted buildings in the city and restores them to be habitable again.  they also do job training with many city programs.
"Somehow I don't think those people have $86m in bitcoin to just ""give away.""  I'm sure this guy has his own lambo already."
Can you please give to http://www.sickkids.ca ? They saved my nieces life, who was only 6 months old at the time, with a heart transplant and she is thriving now. 
"I used to work for a non-profit Pennsylvania College Access Program, or [PA-CAP.org](http://pa-cap.org/), They help inner-city high school kids get into college to achieve things they never thought possible. They help with financial aid paperwork, finding scholarships, letters of recommendation, and general life advice for less-privileged urban youth.

"Welp, I submitted a more selfish one.

I work in a disadvantaged rural school school in Australia. Our kids limit of technology and stem exposure is a few PC labs and a couple Lego robots kits.

We've applied twice for a grant supposed to supply up to $4million to exactly our situation in buckets up to $50k for laser cutters and maker spaces, and been knocked back each time.

So I applied and asked for $100k. We could by a massively useful laser cutter, a few 3d printers, maybe even a small educational milling machine. This is tech that otherwise doesn't exist in 300 miles for our kids.

I realise in terms of total impact, eff, Wikipedia, and lots of others could likely get much more impact straight up, but this would make a massive amount of difference to a few hundred students every year for potentially decades.

Shrugs. I've submitted and op is the decision holder.

----
Disadvantaged in the respect that 40% of our students have no employed members of their households, 42% are indigenous, 31% are below ""the poverty line"" 23% live in government housing et cetera. And then we're a town 400kms away from major cities."
hmm, so the price of bitcoin fluctuating doesn't affect the amount donated?

Hi my name is Charitable Causes
"Well done, it's good to see someone do something nice and worthwhile with their 'good luck'.

Have you thought about buying (and holding or even burning) some GridCoin and CureCoin? These are not your usual cryptocoins in both the way they are created but also what is achieved..

Both are issued/created from the data processing done via 2 volunteer computing projects called BOINC and Folding@home, run by Berkeley and Stanford Universities; These projects encompass many sub projects much of which are also run by International Universities.

The projects that data is processed for, and which is how the coins are created and issued, include Academic and private research projects doing work on various Science, Math, Technology, Climate change, Medical, and many other important projects.

Medical projects including those trying to find cures and doing research on: Aids, TB, Zika, Ebola, Alzheimer's, Cancer - as well as general Protein folding.

Other science projects include: tracking Asteroids, Modelling climate change, Encryption, Proving/Disproving Mathematical conjectures, and many others.

    https://boinc.berkeley.edu
    https://folding.stanford.edu

Obviously by purchasing and holding (or burning) CureCoin and GridCoin it will decrease supply and increase demand, thereby rising the price - which in turn will then bring in new generations of those looking to 'mine' these coins, later finding out that rather than producing pointless hashes, instead they are actually processing data for important research projects.

In terms of donations, both BOINC and F@H as well as most of the sub projects have a way you can donate, including in some cases by cryptocurrency also.

Anyway, either way, again well done for sharing you good fortune to make the World a better place."
"Wow dude you are amazing, you really are making a difference out there. I wish everyone thought the same as you did. I recently got some gains on my lowly investment and donated to Alzheimer's research.

Please consider donating too - it is one of the worst diseases, robin williams killed himself off of it...

Anyway thank you for what you are doing. You're one of the good ones 

Edit: all the low key beggar posts you guys should be ashamed. OP is donating millions of his money to charity and you want a slice of that pie, God you suck. "

"How about paying off some student loans for some of us dedicated redditors <3

But really, check out http://www.hackersforcharity.org/ 

Charity on this level is absolutely inspirational."
"Shout out to [Stichting Ambulancewens](https://www.ambulancewens.nl/) *(Ambulance Wish Foundation)*.

This is a Dutch non-profit organisation *(also do work in Belgium, Germany, the United Kingdom, Ecuador, Israel and Sweden)* that grants wishes to terminal *(non-mobile)* people and their families. 

These kind souls granted a wish for my mother last year *(only a few weeks before she past away)* and I will take any opportunity to spread the word of the awesome work they do. My mother had cancer and was unable to move after she broke her leg and pelvis after falling *(her bones had become too brittle)*. Stichting Ambulancewens granted her wish to have one last day out with her family *(my sisters, her husband and myself)*. Two awesome volunteers came to pick her up with the ambulance and gave her one last fantastic day out in the open air with the people she loved. Due to her complications this would not have been possible without them.


My mother was so touched by their work, that she wanted people to donate money to Stichting Ambulancewens, instead of buying flowers for her funeral.


This is a relatively small foundation and any form/amount of donations has a huge inpact on it and the people they help. They are 100% volunteers and put all the donation money towards stuff like new equipment (such as second hand ambulances) and the wishes of the people.

"Spend 1% to hire some people to do the charity research for you. EFF, Khan, it's all great, but it's a power law distribution and they are getting 90% of donations.  Because marketing, and it's hard to find smaller charities who you can trust. It takes time and can be risky. But it's very possible that with a little research they can have much bigger impact for the same money. GiveWell does something like that but I would suggest  trying on your own. If you do, please post the results on the fund site or here.

You probably could find reasonable people in academic circles to do the research for you .It's a hard  problem and I know you want to donate money not time, but it may be worth it.

Rock on.

edit. In case you need to convert your BTC to USD before donating somewhere, ask some exchange for 0% fee cooperation. They will very likely do it for publicity and these fees matter with this kind of money.

edit2: instead of simply donating say  $1M to EFF ask them to make a double your donation action. So you donate the same amount as somebody else during that period up to $1M. This  will motivate some people."

"Oo! [Aubrey de Grey did an AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/7i9vrj/this_is_aubrey_im_starting_the_ama_now_and_i/) not long ago! The SENS Foundation is small right now (at least compared to the big guys like the Red Cross), so that kind of money would make a huge difference in their ledger. Here's a video explaining what they're about: [Rejuvenation Biotechnology: The Fourth Age of Gerontology - Aubrey de Grey - RB2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CWkb2gObg0) (19min 53sec).

Tl;Dr: It's a new area of study in medicine: Repairing the damage from the process of aging itself before it gets to the point of pathology and disease. We could live healthier for longer. Aging affects all of us, so any research into this area helps all of us.

Aubrey de Grey is the ""face of the organization"" as it were, and gives talks about the basic principals a lot. He's been doing these talks for some years, the way he explains it makes sense, and he seems invested in making this successful - a great talk to listen to! 

Aubrey has categorized looking at the problem like this: - Altering metabolism to prevent damage from occurring. This is difficult, because metabolism is a complicated system and you can't expect to find a simple solution. - Dealing with the diseases of aging after the damage has led to pathology. This is how gerontology currently works, with treating things like Alzheimer and whatnot. - Repair the damage as it accumulates, like doing preventative maintenance on a car. This is what he's putting the most emphasis on. Currently not many people are researching in this area, and therefore needs more people addressing it, and is what the SENS Foundation focuses on.

Aubrey says what he sees as the 7 types of damage that accumulates over time, and that by categorizing them like that, it breaks the problem into something manageable. They are: Cell loss/cell atrophy, division -obsessed cells, death-resistant cells, mitochondrial mutations, intracellular waste products, extracellular waste products, and extracellular matrix stiffening.

Besides that, nice picks, dude! :D The EFF have been on my mind lately, as I'm figuring they're gonna be the big guns going to court to have the FCC's decision overturned if they vote for Pai's plan tomorrow. If anyone can take the FCC on in that arena, it's them!"
"This might seen like an odd idea at first.
Hi. Ive got an amazing idea. Really famous and well regarded german show host Jan Böhmermann is holding a Charity Show of his Podcast in Berlin and will also accept donations in form of bitcoins this year for the first time ever. Last year he and his team donated 45k euro. it would be really amazing to maybe double this. The publicity would also be overwhelming for cryptocurrencies in whole, because Böhmermann is probably the opinion leader nr.1 in Germany. r/de will also highly appreciate this."
"Please consider a donation to [SENS](http://www.sens.org/). You could close out their Winter 2017 fundraiser with just 6.75 BTC, and [they accept bitcoin](http://www.sens.org/donate).

Also, meta-point, why not start a self-directed charity? That way you can spend the remaining years of your life (hopefully many years if you donate to SENS) putting this money towards good causes rather than all at once."
Please consider donating to [MAPS.org](https://store.maps.org/np/clients/maps/donation.jsp?campaign=93)  I’m a former member of the clinical team.

There is an option to donate btc on the site or I can get you in contact with a member of the support team if you are serious.

"No way OP would be converting to USD before the tax-event donation. I doubt OP wants to donate to the Feds. Of course, OP will end up donating USD, so OP probably donated the BTC to ""Pineapple Fund"" who then does the conversion tax free.

"good on you for wanting to make a difference.

just a thought, but perhaps consider things outside the bitcoin sphere.

i lost my fiance to ovarian cancer in 2011. i'm not particularly wealthy, but i try to make a donation to [the v foundation](https://www.jimmyv.org/about/our-story/) whenever i can. 100% of every cent goes directly to cancer *research*. i want to emphasize that, because many cancer 'charities' are for cancer *awareness*, and none of the money goes towards working for a cure.

"
Dude if youre serious this is not a very smart or effective way to do this. You can make a much bigger difference if you do it correctly, set up a foundation, allow this to grow and give it to people over time when you really determine what is the best use for it. Just take some time before you give away a bunch of money on a whim, you can and should do better than what is being suggested here.

I’m fucking loving seeing the potential of philanthropy in the age of bitcoin and other cryptos. Props to you for being a leader in the movement towards it. I’d like to imagine I would do the same thing if I was in your position.

"I recommend [The Ocean Cleanup Project](https://www.theoceancleanup.com/). It was started by a Dutch university student and aims to clean the pacific ocean from plastic waste.

I'm a monthly donator to the project myself, in lower amounts, however :)

They currently don't state a Bitcoin donation option, though I reached out to them a message asking for one."

"Thank you for being a wonderful person. Please consider donating to Khan Academy: https://www.khanacademy.org/donate

They accept bitcoin donations too. Check the FAQ."

I'm surprised Wikipedia isn't in that list! C'mon man.
