As someone who (stupidly) didn't buy in when I had a chance 4 years ago, thank you for this sound reasoning. I am not gonna impulse buy. I'm satisfied with the money I have and am gonna live and love life now.

Lesson learned, don‚Äôt do stop losses. It‚Äôs what whales feed on. Be happy knowing that you made a whale more rich.
You mean you bet against Bitcoin?
Is it?
"Says every bubble chaser ever. 

Again, cryptocurrency will be very important in the future but at the moment Bitcoin is an obscene asset bubble.

On a different note if people in this sub manage to sell just as big firms get into the market and it crashes it will be a brilliant day."
Sorry meant it's the most extreme bubble in history. 900% in a year is ridiculous.
Yep. Most likely outcome really.
I was making a joke. I bought $100 of bitcoin and a whole litecoin. 
listen to him. buy crypto. most coins go up together. always buy alittle bitcoin. its the king.
no wonder her nose was bleeding 
I'm calling it right now, when we get past 18 we will have an influx of barely legal bitcoin memes.
I read that the marked would crash if those original coins appeared in the blockchain. Why is that?
Mining is so 2009 bro.....
You mean DOWN to 0.0000001?
it crashes and goes back up because Bitcoin is sound money and more and more people realize this.
Said everyone since it hit $1 in 2011
"Don't listen to the nobody. Ps prepare for ugly sweater season; winters coming"

When will you sell if it drops? 6k? Will you hold out for upturn?"
Until people start to sell it.

No! It‚Äôs definitely not lol.

Everything is only worth what someone is willing to pay for it.
Rather than whatching the number, watch  the one week chart to watch for trends. What you want to see is higher lows,  basically look at each low point dip and if the one to the right is higher than the last and you continue to see that happen, chances are good that it will continue to go up and be healthy. It‚Äôs when those lows get lower and lower is where to expect a decrease 
Cause it was the only food Mike could sneak her for awhile she didn't know much else.
The pseudonomys creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto is believed to have the most Bitcoin, he has dissapeard tho, presumably dead or in hiding, coins might be lost too.
Buy and sell orders do not affect the Blockchain or the overall supply of bitcoins.

Get out man its gunna dump on you if you don‚Äôt.
Stranger things, show on Netflix
This is way better than 90% of the threads in this sub.
People who aren't familiar with bitcoin have been saying this for the past 9 years. I've been buying bitcoin since 2012 and I'm never worried about anything, I let it do its thing. Regardless of the price, bitcoin is a very cool technology back by a very strong network and great code.
Scarcity and more people want to buy. There‚Äôs not enough for everyone. The only choice is for the price to go up.
Ethereum is going to be the best one. Spend the time to research it. 
Now now was soon.
I hope that's in grands

At least I get this one :/
Sad
Great eyes, neither did I. 
$15,000
That stop loss is too high. If should be around $7.5k at this point. 
When bitcoin grows by 20%, your capital grows by 20%. The same is true for litecoin. It doesn't matter which cryptocurrency you buy. Having lots of cheap units or having part of an expensive unit is exactly the same thing. There's no reason to expect litecoin to grow more than bitcoin, the star of the show. The only people who think that they can't afford to buy bitcoin are people who mistakenly believe that they have to buy an entire bitcoin.
Or expand to bigger bubbles and suck up all the other bubbles and trap the non bubble believers inside and float away, or leave you hanging outside of the bubble like in the movie UP
"ya'll do that, I'll sell at 999 000.

absolutely, here are rare pepe cards on the blockchain that trade with real value with real pepecash | http://rarepepedirectory.com | https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pepe-cash/

"Every time I've seen someone new ask about investing, the ""don't invest more than you can afford to lose"" advice comes up. Of course it won't be a standalone post, nobody would upvote one of those daily."
"People are excited because price is going through the roof and they want to celebrate. thats your problem?

EDit: also there was a stickied post all about that."
No it hasnt. You just proclaim it. In reality, you dont have ny idea if/how many is risking their life savings. 
Wut? Just go to a price website and set the chart on logarithmic. bitcoinaverage.com is good. Didnt understand ur point on second part.
When? 
"Where were you with this advice a few months ago? 

Typical reddit."
It doesn't work that way and you are rather foolish for thinking this is a viable strategy for increasing alpha
You can only get the loot boxes when you are rich..
So the whales simply want a sense of pride and accomplishment?
This
If it's crashing to 15k, then probably from 30-35
This my prediction as well. I think it will hit 15,k by the end of the year
To 15k?!  Where does it crash from then 17k?
"Sooo everything that grows this quickly is immediately a bubble? Not trying to argue, i know nothing about finance/markets, just curious.

If something is truly revolutionary, could it not rise very quickly without necessarily being a bubble?"
Your point is invalid.
very wrong. sooo wrong.. people who understand moon landing will be rich indeed.
"You know, I‚Äôve yet to see that on one of these front page memes. It‚Äôs not what the sub is selling everyone on. They‚Äôre selling everyone on getting rich. Period.

Maybe some users are responsible and try to urge people to be responsible, but that‚Äôs not apparent."
This is the problem. You all are treating this as an equal, or actually a lesser comparison, to trends in the past. Percentages are not all that matter here. When people without great savings have a ton of money on the line, it doesn‚Äôt matter if trends when it was near worthless (compared to now) show one thing. The game has changed.
"First, got a pic?

Second, logarithmic means exponential
 If a logarithmic graph puts it rushing any more than a straight line, it's exponential."
What if bitcoin is a plot by Charon to increase ferry prices?
I would buy necrocryptocurrency, that sounds sick
We passed it
"Well i knew that but i didn't know that ""it's"" could also mean it has"
It‚Äôs so funny because we all believe in it. I told everyone around me if they had any brain, to get in. The best part about buying bitcoin is to laugh at everyone else. It‚Äôs still not too late to get in. I believe it hit 50,000 by the end of next year. Keep in mind that some of the most aggressive predictions have underestimated bitcoin. 
You don‚Äòt set a stop loss, you hodl.
"The rich get richer, it‚Äôs an easy game for them because that amount of money controls the market. We are at their mercy unless you hold strong, every strong rally they‚Äôll attempt to shake off the weak hands, and the weak hands always pay dearly, while they grow in wealth. 

This is why the hodl meme is thrown around all the time, a newcomer who attempts to time the market, and try to profit from the whales often get fucked big time. It‚Äôs like trying to beat the casino at its own game, you‚Äôre more likely to lose than win."
This is gold.
But when will then be now?
More volatility?
Me too.
I actually bought just a tiny amount to test this theory... it worked!
Short bitcoin then buy .0000001 bitcoin to cause crash. Profit. Rinse and repeat 
"tell your wife when you buy and sell ;-)"
if u buy and sell at the same time you won't lose any!
"While I know that past performance is no indicator of future performance, it has gone from something around $100 to almost $1000 in a very short - handful of weeks - span of time.  That same performance at a starting point of $5000 would put it at 4.5 million.

I'm not expecting 4.5 million.  Or even .5 million.

But getting to 30-40k by New Years, before newbies freak and people really start calling it a pump and dump and it crashes?  Sounds reasonable to me.

(I claim no expertise, obviously.)"
"Yes its exponential. I was not saying otherwise. Just that the rise this time around is the least steep compared to the other major rises. 

Just go to bitcoinaverage.com and choose to see the logarithmic chart. Most sites has both linear and logarithmic.   "
But now, now is then
No thats BTG, this is BTC
No, it's because they want your bitcoins on the cheap. If people just hold and not set up stop-losses/margin trade then the whales look like fucking idiots trying to get others to sell their bitcoins when they set up their sell walls (and lose THEIR bitcoins when they get bought up).
It's a meme mocking EA's microtransaction policy. We want to give the player a sense of pride and accomplishment = give us all them sweet, sweet monies
tbf how many people here are actually getting rich
So is the answer instant orders?
yeah and its only going get worse with futures contracts.
">...it‚Äôs a easy game for them because that amount of money controls the market.

I'm pretty confident that it's actually me that controls the market. I can trigger crashes with a click of the buy button and moonshots with the sell. It's a gift, really. I just need to figure out how to harness this power."
I don't think mid january it already is on 30-35k
i have been riding since early 2013.. lots of fun... especially when price rallies.. see you in 3 years for next leg up to 100k
This is obviously going nowhere. It‚Äôs not simply the meme posts, it‚Äôs the entirety of the childish comments within the posts that illustrate that the majority of this community isn‚Äôt necessarily ‚Äúinvesting‚Äù in a safe manner. Almost no one acknowledges that the entire thing could fall at any moment. The vast majority of people here are circle jerking each other and creating an aura of winning that can never fail. You might not see this, but it‚Äôs there.
"Hensaodnitnrose exponentially. You said it's not a big rise if you look at logarithmic scale.

If it's going upwards on a log scale, it's exponential.

Best site for a log scale on Bitcoin? First three I tried don't have one.

Edit, found one, and found a pic from June, ironically with comments saying they think itll hit 10k by end of year then crash.

It's rising exponentially."
A while back.
Just now. We're at now now
Preparing to make the same mistake myself. I recently lost the majority of my own crypto holdings to some stupid margin trading. 
Don't let them squeeze ya
I keep thinking the same thing.
"Seriously, other than very tight stop-losses for very precise trading, stop losses in crypto just cost you money.

(at least, assuming you are longing coins which you know will eventually go up)
"
Hard to say. Could shoot up as well. People will be getting access to their BCH. Will they sell and buy more bitcoin? It seems like a safe bet that BCH will take a tumble in Jan.
Don't forget millibits.

I put much more than that and my ROI is over x10 for now, it's still the logic I had.
If you've ever gambled (then you know instinctively) the gravy train doesn't last forever... AND Everyone has their own level of satisfaction from their ROI.
Estimating the top is always the hardest. But yeah, if bitcoin crashes below 2k they still won.
You just enumerated why it is the best currency in the market.
liquidate your stocks and buy crypto :). i mean at least 10% networth in crypto
If the stock market crashes, enough people will likely sell their Bitcoin that it will fold. The entire thing is built upon a sense of scarcity and people holding. If just one of the major holders sells their entire stock, the market will crash. They won‚Äôt though, because they know that, but when an entire market can hinge on one person‚Äôs actions, it‚Äôs volatile as fuck.
This is the correct response
Taxes aren‚Äôt reduced in the way you‚Äôre imagining. Seriously, compare this to the shit that went down in the 1920‚Äôs. It‚Äôs freakishly similar, and we cannot expect something different to happen this time around, especially given the fact that the market is so artificially pumped up right now. It‚Äôs not going to be good.
No, it couldn‚Äôt. We‚Äôre at a time now that the actual ‚Äúinvestment‚Äù the regular Joe‚Äôs are throwing down is big money for them. Years ago if someone had a couple hundred in Bitcoin, and it crashed, no big deal. But because of its past, people are putting down their entire savings into Bitcoin. If it crashes, they will lose everything. That‚Äôs the difference and it‚Äôs something you all seem incapable of admitting, or realizing. The hype that got you to these numbers could also be the downfall, and a downfall that wouldn‚Äôt be recovered from.
People are selling it constantly.
Has btc ever done the same rise as it did for the last 12 months? Literally grew exponentially.
It's only too late if you're dead. You better buy them with your credit card though, because you might already be in the ground when your account gets credited with your bank transfer. Buy them on your death bed, give your wallet's seed to the people you actually love and no one can prove that you gave them anything, not even the tax man. Or get buried with your private keys, that's the modern version of a Bronze Age chieftain's funeral.
Might as well, you're gonna die anyway. At least you can die with bitcoin

What other reason for dumping 4000BTC and clearing the order booking would be? Followed by more 2000-3000BTC dumps. It‚Äôs to trigger stop losses and margin call longs. Think of it as a bunch of loot boxes to be opened up and taken.
"i never sold in 2013 from 1200 USD to 300 USD.

now I am fucking rich because I knew Bitcoin would get back up after MtGox stolen coins would be sold over 2014/2015.

to the moon!"
So is picking up change on the ground, but people still do it 
I agree, I'm expecting a crash to 15k around mid January.
Of course lol.
fiat is a well round version of the ponzi scheme just wait.
You aren't rich until you sell them... I hope you sell them at the right time.
"By swing trade?

Daytrading is pretty self explanatory and longterm investing as well. Swing trades are an intermediate.

Basically a swing trade is when you see a price swinging around a resistance point for a few days or weeks and buy it on the low swings, sell it on the high swings. Such as BTC has been doing swinging around the 10k landmark price.

For a while you could set your watch to $AMD falling to 2-3 bucks because Intel was taking over the world, everyone crying bankruptcy, then swinging back to $4 when people bothered to look at their finances. It was easy pickings for anyone who noticed the pattern.

A blow-off top is when a price rises too fast and abruptly pulls back ‚Äî not necessarily because of bad news but just because impulsive or ""weak hand"" investors decided saw a scary steep line and decided to cash out. Like when these mainstream journo dorks were reporting 11k back to 9k as a ""catastrophic plummet! bubble has popped! oh no!. They can be prime swing trading targets."
That guy was talking in absolute, not in ifs. I agree with you of course. Not with him.
This guy knows, he's from the 20s
"There is a reason people here repeats the mantra - ""dont invest more than you can afford to lose"". Its because people also went nuts the last time around. Nothing new."
Yep
"Yes. 4 times. This is actually the ""softest"" if you look at a logarythmic chart."
I'm not dying before I have a good entry point!
Its a well rounded version of the ponzi scheme just wait. Some will get out and make TONS and others will be greedy and bitcoin will take all their money.
[deleted]
"""Its"" is possesive, ""It's"" is a contraction of ""it is"" or ""it has"".

""It's"" would be correct here."
Next week?
Friday been done hit
There wasn't a movie called Jason for a really long time. Before that they were all Friday the 13th. Much like Freddy Kruger didn't have a movie named after him either. That was Nightmare on Elm Street...
Yah I had it around 8 and moved it up too quickly
Don't do stop losses, worst advice. The advice before that is don't margin trade. And buy it out right. 
Depends on your strategy. There are ways to make money other than holding if you need $ short term. Still, holding is clearly more profitable long term
TIL stop losses = krill
Wow, that just blew my mind! And I‚Äôm sitting here thinking I am pretty smart for always setting a stop loss.
He means he thought btc was rising to high and would crash soon. It will but that will happen in January. (Source: btc price history by month.)
But a lot of Cryptos grow wayy faster im value! Are they all even crazier bubbles?
What happened to then?!
You have nothing unless you cash it out.

Finally a quality 11k meme, this one should make decent support, no longer have to rely on vegeta.
12k of Christmas 
"This is what we need: just ONE high quality meme in each price bracket.

Not an overflow of bad quality ones filling the front page.

Thank you sir! Please do a nice 12k one when we get there."
Perfect. Top blow off so we lost weak hands. 13k guaranteed.
"I bought 6 bitcoins in 2010 trying to buy some ecstasy off the dark net. Never bought it. Now i have 66k. Good times my dudes. 

^^^^jk ^^^^i ^^^^have ^^^^nothing ^^^^:("
What other crypto currencies should I consider buying?

THAT 9.57 I PUT IN A FEW WEEKS AGO HAS REACHED AN ALL TIME HIGH OF 12.19. THIS IS IT BOYS. THIS IS THE ONE.
I guess we're back to the circle jerk
"I'm a bit dissapointed that the meme isn't just Eleven with a huge ""K"" (without the ""11"") next to her. :)"
Made with Bitcorn?
Dank shitpost, I love it.
I don't know if this one is dank enough to give us 11k support.  Hope so
Here is [my contribution to our 11k achievement](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7gzsem/cue_the_kubrick_music_round_2/) again... cue the Kubrick music! There are quite a few Easter eggs in this new image :)
Four fifty. Rainbow. Four to the left. Three to the right.
This my 3rd time seeing this and I didn‚Äôt notice that the Eggo boxes have ‚Äúbitcoin‚Äù on them 
I truly believe bitcoin is actually a reflection of r/memeeconomy. With reddits ability to generate an infinite amount of memes, the price will only continue to rise!
"Aaaand it's going to wallstreet, get ready for a crash because rich wallstreet boiis will go short on bitcoin because it's a ""buuubleee herp derp"" ""it's virtual, it doesn't exist"", ""#FriedAir"""
When your $12 worth of bitcoin jumps to $13.88 :-)

No more time to tell how
This is the season of what
Now is the time of returning
With thought jewels polished and gleaming
Now is the time past believing
The child has relinquished the reign
Now is the test of the boomerang
Tossed in the night of redeeming
Eight sided whispering hallelujah hatrack
Seven faced marble eye transitory dream doll
six proud walkers on jinglebell rainbow
Five men writing in fingers of gold
Four men tracking down the great white sperm whale
Three girls wait in a foreign dominion
Ride in the whale belly
Fade away in moonlight
Sink beneath the waters
to the coral sand below
Now is the time of returning"
Wtf. 
add more memes guys, obviously bitcoin will not increase with air 
"Look bloody awesome here in NZD

"really need a This is Spinal Tap [""11""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOO5S4vxi0o) meme."
What's gonna happen at 13? Skip right over it, like hotel elevators?
That's some solid shopping
Darn why didnt i think of this one lol nice touch
Bitcoin - part of a healthy nutritious breakfast!
I was so ready to down vote this until I actually saw the image
Nice! I love it!
/r/bitcoin: come for the memes, stay for the lambo. 
What are Bitcoin futures going to bring to the market?
"Your comment was ambiguous. He said it was exponential and it seemed you were rebutting.

Exponential growth is a bad sign."
Stranger things indeed.

I want it to get to 10k‚Ç¨ so I can tell my parents they doubled the money they asked me to invest in bitcoin for them.

Bitchin'
Technically if everyone changed their sell price of Bitcoin to $1 million, wouldn‚Äôt the price rise to $1 million?
This meme economy is real
aaaand w're back down
If it starts to falter I've got us covered with a secret weapon: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBJbhu35Ejw
Didnt even notice that...wow!
Why did you switch the d and l?
Didn't even notice until you mentioned it haha
Especially in the mirrors!
Sooo many Bitcoin memes lately, but this, this was good. A+
"Thanks, here's a [zoom in](https://imgur.com/a/9ScCR). 


Crap, just noticed I forgot a logo on the left box. Dammit. "
This is trash tier meming tbh
Just wait until the Clerks memes when it hits 37
"yes, because Bitfinex just printed another 25 millions fraudulent Tethers    LOL

http://omnichest.info/lookupadd.aspx?address=3MbYQMMmSkC3AgWkj9FMo5LsPTW1zBTwXL"
This is the only thing that brought the price back up. People heard about this meme and wanted to see it 
Why is she taking her eggos out of cold storage though? Not a true hodler
I can't wait for the next shit post when BTC corrects in prices lmao.
http://i.imgur.com/RyTpx2h.gifv
that was the part that made me laugh out loud when I noticed it.  nice touch.
"Step 1 get an address

Step 2 make a sign asking for bitcoin with a QR 

Step 3 get it on tv

Step 4 profit"
Best time to buy is always now.
It's never too late
Sure. Stocks have done well historically, but bitcoin has done better during its existence.
"Yes, do not invest more than you are willing to lose.

Consider that money lost."
A girl called Eleven from Stranger Things
Congrats! Could go up to millions U.S. dollars, so you‚Äôre still early. The question really is how cheap the $ will be.
"Yes
"
New Bitcoin fork 
I get 2.50 from 1 GPU.
It's melt down is inevitable. Those who cash out first win! All others will painfully lose in this game...
No more of a bubble than the USD. 
maybe after we reach 100K
Cant be a worse bubble than real estate bonds /2008 flashbacks/
"Bitcoin is a huge bubble.

Believe that someone have yet to cash out in USD. "
Try checking the last thread. Some say to the moon, others are still waiting for a correction since 8000. The moon shouts get louder and the regret gets stronger in the respective camps.
I personally believe its scarcity and underlying technology, specifically the blockchain, speaks for itself.
"I think it has long term potential but wouldn't be surprised if it crashed to 2-6k sometime in the next few months. 

Equally I wouldn't be surprised if it rose to 13-15k in the next few months."
"It‚Äôs a gamble. I see this is a bubble that will eventually burst and never recover. The fact that this sub exists, and is in the state that it is, should tell you something. Would you trust these people with your money? I, for one, wouldn‚Äôt.

Or it could keep on keeping on and become the new world currency. But I highly doubt that. This seems like a fad more than anything, and when it inevitably crashes, I just can‚Äôt fathom it recovering. Too many people will be burned in such a way that they will not be able to recover. A lot of people ‚Äúinvesting‚Äù in bitcoin are putting almost all of their money into it because they see others making insane amounts of money. Problem is, when it crashes hard, a lot of people will be left with absolutely nothing. At that point the hype train will be gone, and it will never return, because of the crash. That‚Äôs my theory at least. Everyone here will disagree with it though, because they‚Äôre not legitimate investors and they didn‚Äôt diversify worth shit, and this idea scares the living shit out of them.

Edit: Also, the stock market is likely going to take a fucking nosedive if the tax bill passes. It‚Äôs a complete repeat of the 1920‚Äôs leading into the Great Depression. If that happens, Bitcoin will fold."
"It‚Äôs possible there‚Äôll be a crash sometime soon, or in the near future, or possibly further than that. Maybe it will quickly recover and rise to all new highs, or it could be years before it recovers, if at all. Alternately it could trend sideways for a short time, a while, or a long time.

Let‚Äôs not ignore the fat that it‚Äôs all a complete and total fiction anyway, and humans are all completely mental because they ascribe value to shiny rocks, pretty paper, likes, fitting in, being different, freedom, security, and upvotes. 

(Personally I see no bubble)

Edit: I‚Äôve scrolled down this far and I still have no reference for this meme. Am I that out of touch? Yes :("
Pro tip: No one has any clue what is going on with Bitcoin.
Dogecoin gotta be raking it in then.

This guy fucks 
Yes we saw that meme too
No you dont. Especially after this Bitcoin bubble is over and its all worth nothing again.
No, you don't. 
And you wish you owned Apple and Tesla. To want things that are worth money is a pretty basic human feeling. 
Watch out for the DemiCash, boys.
Oh shit, did someone say [Eleven](https://youtu.be/gZa4yre0uEk?list=WL&t=70)?
Bitcoins price increases at the same rate as the dankness of our memes.
Wait... does that mean the meme economy *is real?*

Awesome shitpost!
Always buy the dip when it comes to bitcoin.

My FOMO buy at 10.5k then the proceeding 9.5k attempt-to-catch-a-falling-knife buys are looking pretty sweet right now. #daytrader 
why did she like eggos so much?
Hearing this, the guy's nose bled. Literally.
I was leaning more towards https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FFRoYhTJQQ personally
"###I just cashed out some originally 2009 bitcoins yesterday I'm so fucking happy.

What would you do with 20K?  "
"Wha, no way. *checks google*

^^fuck."
"Need moar high quality memes to stabilize $12k price.

What‚Äôs next? Tom Brady or Seahawks?
Pardon you sir, I believe you just meme'd
Haha!

Wonder who has the most btc. And quantity
ü§™
Question: Which buy order increases the supply of bitcoin on the blockchain if the buy wall and sell wall trades with each other on the exchange only. So, if a whale buys to pump up the price, he is actually buying from the sell wall. So, how did the supply of bitcoin increases, or it never increase at all?
Wait, did we have this kind of posts back in the day with 50 cent as meme? 
Totally just noticed the logos
Lol
How much will it be on the 18th december? party day!
10800
I honestly can't wait for us to flood with 40K memes lol 
You can buy so many Eggo‚Äôs with 1 Bitcoin lol
Seems to be sitting at 11k for a while today, im a partial noob,  so does this mean anything good and or bad?
That feel when you are late to the crypto currency train and have to buy litecoin instead. 
"When we get to Twelve, should I post a picture of a scientist in Alien: Resurrection saying ""...Twelve"" because he's saying how many more Aliens are on the ship!"

Man this thing is the biggest fucking bubble in history. Like cryptocurrency is definitely going to be important going forward but good lord this is an obscene bubble.
