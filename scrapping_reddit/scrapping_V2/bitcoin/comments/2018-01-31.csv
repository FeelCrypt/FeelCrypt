Isn't the narrative here now that bitcoin stopped being a currency and moved to store of value?
And the horrible spreads 
"There's no telling whether it will drop to 2k in 4 weeks or soar to 30k. Everything you do is just a lucky guess.

The assumption that makes it feel like a safe investment is that one day it will be worth 50k after steady climbing, we just don't know when."
Only 2/3 is copy pasted.
Guess that's what all these youtube videos hyping bitcoin are for.  Fishing for those *greater fools* to boost the portfolios of people who have already invested?
"you can sell them on the futures to leverage the upside potential in the near term and short the altcoins to de risk the arbitrage.

"Flooding the market with shitty used GPUs would drive down the prices of new GPUs as well.  Assuming all the miners close up shop all that demand for new GPUs goes away and that drops the price.  Plus at some point as the price of old GPUs drop people decide to switch from new to old even if they're ""shitty"".  Render farms would happily take miners old cards--they're going to be buying in bulk anyway.  At the point where used GPUs were half the cost of new a lot of people would switch from new to used and figure they could just buy another one if the first one failed.  Somewhere in the middle there supply+demand would find an equilibrium price."
Hrmmm, can you actually wear out RAM like that? I get GPUs being overworked but I thought RAM was generally kept live all the time to store any data regardless of actual use.
Why do gamers think this? My 4.5 year old GPU I use in my rig has handled a hell of a lot more abuse just in the last 6 months than any of mine or my friends mining cards and my gaming GPU is running just fine. Its been used damn near every day since it was bought, especially when I was job hunting for 6 months and would regularly play for 6+ hours a day with tons of temperature fluctuation. My mining cards however sit at under 65°c  with hardly any fluctuation. The only thing that might wear out in the next decade on a GPU are the fans. As long as the card hasn't been physically abused (which from what I've seen is much more likely to happen with a gamers old GPU) there's nothing wrong with GPU's used for mining.
Anecdotal, I know, but I bought a 660Ti off a miner for $180 back in 2014 and its still going strong.
Short position on graphics cards and ram producers... still profit.
There is already a coin tied to gold. It's called Digix (DGD)
Card failures cost time, and in mining time is money. The fans may get worn and need replacement, but the cards themselves undergo very little thermal fluctuations like typical gaming GPUs see. I'm fine with buying miners cards.

"It absolutely **can** be made transparent and behind the scenes.  I don't think it *will* for a while still, and who knows, it may be too late, but it definitely can.

People already are familiar with debit cards, and the idea of having to have money in an account to spend it, so it's not much of a stretch.  Eventually, wallets will get to the point where using LN is essentially transparent, heck some will probably even create one behind-the-scenes without you even knowing it, and *only* provide LN services, but in a way the user doesn't have to deal with it, and can use it like a normal account.

Again, it'll probably be a while before LN is stable and then before wallets integrate this kind of support, but it's definitely possible in a way that most people can understand."
"> They won't understand why they have to make large down payments far ahead of time before they can spend. They won't understand what channels they need to open up and why they have to pay into it as well.

They already need to make down payments ahead of time (buying bitcoins) before they can spend. By the time LN is ready for mass use (which it isn't now), the user won't be exposed to channels. Their initial buy will establish a payment channel with whoever sold them their coins, and if their software can't find a route for later purchases then it'll create a new channel automatically. 

> It doesn't just work transparently behind the scenes, and requires a completely different and more cumbersome user experience for the masses to easily adapt to.

How do you think it's different from [this demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_pTB8gCuvQ)? I understand that copying and pasting a long address is a pain in the neck, but that will eventually be streamlined with [URIs like bitcoin: links have now](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0021.mediawiki), [payment protocols](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0070.mediawiki), etc.

> It would be easier for users to switch to a different coin that is more user friendly and easier to understand than to switch to Lightning.

There are exchange fees between coins, and then either the low liquidity of unpopular alts or the censorship risk of popular alts. If they're already using Bitcoin, then they can upgrade to a LN client in a single transaction. The average person doesn't care to understand how their money works; just that it does.

By the time it's ready for mass use, the user will care as much about LN channels as they care about finding peers and relaying transactions."

i didn't know this, if this is the case and it doesn't just work behind the scenes then how can it possibly achieve mass adoption, I'm shocked to hear this.

You choose a book for reading
Just look at the volatility across the board. You need stability to have actual value store. 
Guess what, if it goes down to $1, that means there's a 1,000,000% RETURN on investment opportunity when it climbs back to $10,000 which these penny coiners will see as more reliable since it's not backed by dubious whitepaper by some random con artist business man

Not remotely true. There is hardly any alt coins growing right now. And the ones that are, are still down for the month. Nothing is hitting ATH’s while bitcoin is down. As soon as bitcoin becomes Bullish than alt will grow.

You can still mine other crypto with GPUs.  My fiancee and I are both mining with our 1060s (when not gaming on them) and we get about $2-3 a day each.  Easily covers our electricity bill with money leftover.
GPUs and RAM are expensive as fuck right now, and while yes, to be fair, mining isn’t the *main* reason, it’s definitely one of the biggest.
IDK when you can resell used cards for more than they bought them for a year or 2 ago it is sort of indicative of at least an aftermarket rise in price because of inherent value now placed on ability to mine.

"You really do never know what you are going to get.  I am something of a bitcoin maximalist (have been since 2009) but am open to other currencies.  As a result of a collaboration with one alt (BCN, which is the coin from which Monero was forked) which at the time, a few years ago, was 63rd or 65th on the crypto market cap list (it wasn't worth much at that time, relative to some other decentralized cryptosystems), I was able to get an idea integrated into BCN that at the time simply would not have been possible to have been integrated into bitcoin: small, but voluntary microdonations (as an option in the BCN graphical wallet, either from mining or just from transactions).  see http://abis.io for some details.  That was back in late 2015. (Today BCN is 28th on coinmarketcap, it usually has been ranging now somewhere between 20th and 25th, but the past couple days have been rough for all cryptos, though they will bounce back.)

In bitcoin, there was a bit of a waiting game for segwit to activate (now it's activated) and for lightning to become available (now there are hundreds of lightning nodes, though it is still in testing) both of which are preconditions before http://abis.io can be developed in a bitcoin wallet.  (See also a colleague's project (u/ktorn) - http://subsatoshi.org/ -- which will likely find eventual further development and application as lightning development proceeds.)  I think the voluntary microdonation concept envisioned originally and implemented in BCN can soon be developed in the form of a bitcoin GUI wallet that has that same feature.  

Interestingly, BCN and bitcoin have some of the same features now (bitcoin picked up some stuff that was originally present in BCN).  See:

1) https://blockstream.com/2018/01/23/musig-key-aggregation-schnorr-signatures.html

and

2) https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/56nk94/on_chain_scaling_with_schnorr_signatures/d8lmzrf/

So yeah, alts _can_ be good.  just be careful with them in terms of which you play with, and take your time."
Thats why we have CoinCenter to show us da wei
what legalities?
You wouldn't.  I used BTC as a currency until 8/2017 when holding it became more responsible than spending it. I don't want to spend it until I know what it's worth. 
And if I bough my coin for $100 and will and will buy something the next week and the price goes down 20%. Why would I buy it with the btc if that makes it 20% more expensive. May work for like $1 dollar transactions but will have a transaction fee.... Or people buy the bitcoin at the same time they buy it. But why would anyone do that?
"It won’t solve them all, but it’s groundbreaking tech that will encourage people back to BTC. 

If it is successful, a lot of other cryptos will become redundant. "
"Lightning is too complicated and confusing for the average user. They won't understand why they have to make large down payments far ahead of time before they can spend. They won't understand what channels they need to open up and why they have to pay into it as well. 

It doesn't *just work* transparently behind the scenes, and requires a completely different and more combersome user experience for the masses to easily adapt to. As if cryptocurrency wasn't already complicated enough already, Lightning makes it worse. It is a wonky hack workaround solution.

It would be easier for users to switch to a different coin that is more user friendly and easier to understand than to switch to Lightning."
Yes that what I am hoping
lol...how ironic.. buy bitcoin back... so even you agree Bitcoin is the standard.... increase your BTC stash.. everyone values alt in satoshis or bitcoin.

"Market cap is just ""available supply"" multiplied by ""price"". Available supply would simply be the number of tokens you premined. 
Price would be established by a single trade, to yourself if needed. Others can't even drive the price down unless they buy some or mine it.

I remember once having about 300 ETH in a wallet I made when I was debating diversifying my crypto holdings back when ETH was almost brand new. I don't remember what this cost me or even exactly when I did this, which is good. Makes it hard to put my fuck-up into exact numbers. Funny, though, I think of this seldomly, and mostly just laugh when I do. I guess I missed the boat with bitcoin too, really... bought in much later than I could have. Oh well.

Yeah, I’m not saying I wouldn’t, but I’d definitely be more skeptical. A miner’s card would almost certainly die out *long* before a retail one.
This is so true. Miners want their cards to last
I would say it depends on the graphics card. For example, the GTX 1080 is prone to overheating. You don't see a lot of people targeting that card for mining for several reasons, but ultimately wear and tear can happen with these cards due to overheating.
this is correct. they keep temps in the 60c-70c range by under powering them so they don't burn out. Gaming and Rendering have major more wear and tear on GPU's than mining.

"Stay calm and wait for lightning.

All the businesses that stopped accepting it over the rising fees will jump right back in."
The alts are waiting to see what cool guy BTC does, then they copy it to an extreme until it's no longer cool and they revert to seeing what BTC does again.

"Guys do you think we should hodl?

Bitcoin has broken various key resistance levels so might even drop to $6000. With all the news coming out from South Korea, China, Tether/Bitfinex and loads more FUD it is likely it may drop.

I am a big believer in BLOCKCHAIN so confident it will go up but not sure about short term price. This video helped me make up my mind but still not sure? Please advise guys as I might sell now and look to buy back at a cheaper price

There is no value something that takes hours / days to transfer when price is so volatile. If exchange did not exist and we had to move from wallet whenever we want to make a transaction, I'll be waiting until tomorrow to use this as a currency. Your lack of a congruent vision and divisive greed buried you. What is bitcoin but the commodore 64. First to market but sure not to last.
I don’t think so
That is Forest Lopp
Ethereum grows at bitcoins shrinks marketcaps are closing quickly.  Bitcoin is Nokia Ethereum is Apple which will stand the test of time ?
I'd this the same highway to heaven that was posted a few days ago?
Then I was done hodling and I went back home and GPU prices dropped and everyone was happy.
Probably because some major exchanges like bitfinex adding ETH pairs to every coin.

Bitcoin dips, eth dips less.  Bitcoin rises, eth rises more.  Following the leader, but doing it better.  Quietly plotting the takeover.
Pics or it didn't happen.
You know thats only because nobody uses them right? Fucking doge works just as well as any of the alts..
"Continued to survive as a decentralized currency after years and years of speculation from the main stream media that it's either a scam or going to crash because it's a bubble. 

It doesn't have to *do* anything but exist and function as designed, which it is. The network is improving with lightning nodes and segwit, though. "

lol. 60 days ago and that was an ATH
Anally-derived?
Every business that stopped using it cited price fluctuations as the main reason though.
but the legalities
The hard question is why would consumers spend their btc when the value fluctuate so much. What's worth $100 last week could be $120 next week. Btc has slowly becoming a vehicle to storage value and speculation than actual currency.
*cries*
Dont know why people think lightning will salve all the problems all of a sudden
"If you actually followed a worn out meme as an investment strategy, I am sorry to hear that.

It's been obvious there's no use case for Bitcoin for... A long time. It's been trusted as a backbone crypto based solely off of scarcity.

With all the FUD and the tether news, things continue to head in the direction of uncertainty.

If you think you should weather the storm and continue to eat losses until it may or may not turn around, if the dust ever settles, then do so.

But if you don't know *why* you should, don't trust in memers yelping ""hodl"".

It's literally all a gamble right now and has been for a while. You gotta decide if you want to keep all your chips on black."
"Lol except for ethereums/ethereum foundations dark little secret of centralized control over the code as they have proved over the DAO fiasco. 

Don’t get me wrong I’m holding eth short term but I have my doubts long term. "
"> Bitcoin is Nokia Ethereum is Apple which will stand the test of time ?

It sounds like you already have an answer in mind, but I'd say ""whichever one can ignore regulators""."

"if it was, other coins would start increasing, yet the majority of them is going down.

Money is exiting the market, pretty simple"
South Korea and Japan are not excited about bitcoin pick a coin they plan to use and jump ship and watch everyone else follow you. You can buy you bitcoin back with your profits 
1 doge = 1 doge
"Life is like a portfolio of alts; you never know what you are going to get"
Sometimes.
It’s almost like it’s a good idea!
Sell the ETH for BTC if think it's right.

Lots of YouTube influencers recommending moving half or most of your BTC to ETH so expect this to be the case for many folks now
Same.  I switched over a few weeks ago after comparing 3 mo. charts.  Today is the first time in 3 years I'm holding no BTC and it feels odd.

I would like to see what would happen even though I'm sitting in Vechain or maybe because of that because I can't imagine genuine projects just get trashed because of Bitcoin.

Yes. However that would pretty much be a market reset. And i doubt that in that scenario Bitcoin would be the one to end up on top again.

Yeah seriously, or just let them do the mining with ASICs. Bitcoin severely impacted PC gaming market :( 
It has been 5 years since you could mine Bitcoin with graphics cards. Bitcoin is not at fault.

How simple life must appear to you. Bitcoin did not even take its final form.

Supposedly. Anyway, the markets don't always care about this.
And you can see it on road map.

"I remember dollar parity. “Tulip mania.”

Just wish I bought in then. Had I dropped 100 bucks on it then I’d be able to afford my own butler."
"Maybe in some fantasy land, but not this one. Hodlers and people who actually pay attention to the fundamentals and software development progress won't let it.

From a purely technical point of view, bitcoin hasn't been this promising in years. But all the speculators bleeding out in the streets sure serves up a good distraction."
There is no way that can happen at all. Wouldn't you buy hundreds/thousands of coins at that price? This is why it can't happen, there is too much support for that.
w2b 1000 bitcoin then
/r/crackcocoin, by chance?
I have faith in IOTA technology 
Wouldnt the smart thing to do is just lay down $4 worth in like 100 early stage cryptos?
Oh my God if you could get in on a coin as early as that you’d be fucking loaded
In any case you will get chocolate, and who doesn't like it? It's a win situation.
killer comment
My momma always said crypto is like a box of chocolates
Sometimes it’s a website that says “penis”
you need to do more research before investing. At least look on the back of the box, or read the card that comes with the box of chocolates.
Not surprising. It's the only other medium of exchange token and it's a lot better tech wise than Bitcoin.
yes land untouched by people remains pristine
Just started my investment portfolio a little over a week ago when ETH was under $1,000. It's stayed up ever since. Couldn't be happier with my choice.
It generally does dip when Bitcoin does however.
Lmaooo
Maybe. But are they idiots too for following an idiot? He has something they wish they could have.
Right? Long-term, the price doesn't matter. As long as my number of coins is going up, I'm winning.
This is good for bitcoin. 
Lightning is on mainet and close, when that works well it will knockout the need for most alts, too many wannabe Bitcoins out there that haven't even tested scaling issues, going to be glorious. 
This drop is good to see which coins can survive longer term. Same thing happened back in 2014. So. Much. Trash.
How is someone a noob for buying at 13k? BTC was sitting around 15k-17k for quite a while (in crypto time).

"Unless people realize that BTC is bloated and too expensive to move anywhere with any efficiency.

Bitcoin is the low functioning one?
On June 23, 2015, AOL was acquired by Verizon Communications for $4.4 billion
He charmed the pants off Nixon and won a ping-pong competition.  That ain't retarded.
I wish there was Reddit back then. And we could see the archives. That would be magical.
AOL did what Bitcoin should do and pivoted before they went extinct.
Im pretty down for some 6k btc
