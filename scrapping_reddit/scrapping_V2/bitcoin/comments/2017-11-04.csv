All this makes me wonder, even if we'd bought bitcoin back in 2010-2012, how many of us would've bought via mt gox, and lost it, or just had some bitcoin on a destroyed hard drive, or on a lost usb stick.

Yes, because their official currency has been artificially hyper-inflated by their own Gubment.

You can also sell them to gift card sites and redeem them on amazon/eBay. 
So it'd only take you a couple hundred years to withdraw it all, not bad.

That isn't the definition of a scam though is it? By that definition the fiat monetary supply is more of a scam, as bank practice fractional reserve banking, central banks just print more money, cryptocurrencies are much more fair than traditional fiat
I don't own any coins. I'm just pointing out that your assumption was incorrect.
"Sorry, not sure what else I can say. I’m still of the opinion that bitcoin is being promoted *like* a scam.

Here’s an example:

Stock investing is a relatively low risk investment if you take precautions, such as due diligence, research, diversification, etc.

But buying OTC/penny stocks and skipping the research can very quickly delve into scam territory.

Same with Bitcoins.

Does that make my position clearer?"
no denial?
"There has been no overall growth in daily transactions in the last year.

The recent soaring in price has nothing to do with increased use of the currency and everything to do with a surge in speculation from rubes who think its a guaranteed way to get rich quick."
"> Bitcoin gets its value from the knowledge that others would trade for it

> I don't know where people get the idea that bitcoin gets its value from being traded

So in other words it needs to be traded to have value. Gotcha. "
"If there were no trades, then people would not believe that people would trade for it.

Current trades provide confidence that future trades will be possible, as well as establishing current value.

If there were no trades for bitcoin at some price, then the price would drop.  

If there were no trades at any price, then the value is effectively 0; you can't move the asset, so it is as valuable as...something without value, maybe pocket lint."
Wait until people discover Bitcoin is just a massive conspiracy by NVidia and AMD to sell more midrange video cards. /s
"> long with the massive waste of people running hundreds of video cards 24/7 for no productive reason.

You know not of what you speak of.  Those video cards provide the equivalent of a fiat mint and the logistics required to move money around the banking system.  That's a shit ton of fossil fuels and armed men.  You have come to your conclusion without even doing a tiny bit of research.  Crypto may not be for you and that's ok but you should refrain from pulling shit out of your ass and then getting upset about it because you literally just made up a fake arguing point."
it was a gamble. Somebody asked me if they should invest in bitcoin. I told them, it's a gamble. And I would tell the same thing again.
I’d like to see what’s more energy intensive: gold mining or cryptocurrency mining. Especially now that block chains aren’t cracked as often.

I bought two ounces of weed for like 20 BTC some 5 years ago. It was good weed, but it wasn't $140000 good. 
Presumably, it would be possible to recover 'lost' Bitcoin if the miners all agreed on a method. Bitcoin not touched in X years can be added to your mined block in a similar way they add BTC to their accounts when they mine a block... Right?
Meanwhile letting it mostly stay as bitcoin means it hopefully continues gaining value.
lol k
Not sure where you are getting your numbers from... go to coinmarketcap.com and you will see the worldwide volume in just the LAST 24 HOURS is well over $2.5 BILLION... 🤔
What do you think would happen to the market if someone effectively doubled the amount of available bitcoins on the market every day for 3 days? 
"It does it doesn’t work like that. Putting that much out on the market at once would cause a price crash. 

You’d have to meter it out over months or, more realistically, years. "
The difference between those two things is like me saying if there were a total of 1.5 billion dollars in withdrawals at ATMs in the USA yesterday then you could walk up to an ATM outside a bank in WVA and get 1.5 billion dollars out of an account. Not how it works.
The point I was making is that there's this proclivity for cryptocurrency advocates, particularly Bitcoin advocates, to not acknowledge the actual realistic difficulty of exchanging large amounts of Bitcoin for real currency.
Same as if you held a huge amount of shares in whatever and sold it all. If you saturate a market, demand dips. This isn't a Bitcoin thing. 
Exactly, because you could also have bought another 50 btc to replace it for $100.

"Daily volume of Bitcoin alone in the last months has been over 1 billion dollars.

What you might have trouble with is crashing the price by selling it all at once and you bank/government giving you very funny looks or even freezing your account when you withdraw that much. "
"Yeah exchanges have limits on how much can be sent to a bank at a given time. But you would just sell it in increments. Quadriga CX in Canada, for example, allows up to 10k at a time, I believe?


So yes, you wouldn't be able to sell it all in one lump sum. I'd be ok with $10k a day lol.


Of course, you could just buy things directly with Bitcoin. In some countries, people are accepting bitcoin for real estate purchases, for example."
some people
What a wonderful argument you put forth. Go ahead, throw all your money at an unregulated system with no intrinsic value. I'm sure it will work out for you.
They can also buy a lottery ticket, which is a scam that preys on poor people.
"The market is easily manipulated by those with wealth/power to benefit themselves at the expense of lower-level ""investors.""

Don't think that just because it is possible to profit that it is not a scam. At best, it's gambling, which is kind of a scam. "
Good job, get the poor people to buy your bs so it will go up in value so those that hold the most coin can cash out and crash the market. Brilliant strategy.
Okay here i think is another interesting contrast between the lottery and Bitcoin. Out of everyone who has ever bought a lottery ticket, maybe one in a million or one in ten million will get a return of  their initial investment. That's .000001 percent or .0000001 percent. But out of everyone who has ever bought and is holding Bitcoin, 100 percent have seen their initial investment rise. In many cases rise by  100's, 1000's, and 10,000's percent. Disclaimer: past performance blah blah something something future something something.
"> makes me think you all know bitcoin is a scam

Sounds like you are implying that it is a scam, and that anyone promoting it is fully aware and yet promoting it anyways...

Nothing could be further from the truth, coming from the base level of that claim that ""bitcoin is a scam"". Bitcoin is as much of a scam as oil and gold are scams."
Lmao, fuck off ya creep
You’d still be making like $65/hr, not shabby
But if an increasing number of people just buy up Bitcoin and sit on it, that will increase the price causing whales to sell distributing coins into more hands. More buyers/holders increases price resulting in positive feedback loop for media attention. Eventually at some price point major retailers are incentivized to accept it then corporations and possibly government  start buying. That all seems good for decentralization.
To live stream something i'm already performing? 
The bitcoin offered was worth $200k 
It is speculative but I trust the coders that improve the protocol more than I trust any government or central bank of any country outside North America and Europe. Governments have a long history of sucking at managing monetary policy. When rich people get together and set their standards they do what they need to to benefit themselves. I trust the minds and the incentives behind bitcoin more than anything else. 
Even if you did, you honestly think you would still be holding onto those 10 dollar coins today? You would have either sold at 50, or sold immediately after the first crash, or the second, or the 3rd, or the 4th. I would love to know how many people bought them at 5 or mined them themselves back then and intentionally kept them this long. Id be willing to bet the number is very small.

"That's still several years ;) "
Serious questing, how is it NOT traded like a stock? People buy a share of it in hopes that it's value will increase, no? 
It is, and you have to pay capital gains taxes on it every time you buy something with it or convert it to another currency. Else the IRS will obliterate you if they find out.
"Don't look past the obvious. What do people do more?

1. Buy Bitcoin to use it in exchange for goods and services.

2. Buy Bitcoin to sell someday and make money.

Which I agree, is not exactly a stock, but is definitely not within the spirit of a currency. If nobody is purchasing anything with Bitcoin, then it will fail again."
I mean, it is, just like all other currency. 
He or she could have meant that people are buying bitcoin as an investment instead of using it as a currency. 
Easier than cash?
Not to mention instant depreciation as soon as it’s moved off the lot
If you lose the Bitcoin private key, the Bitcoin is lost. It's much like cash. If you lose cash, there is no person, company, gov agency or bank you can call to get it back. On the plus side, there is no person, company, gov agency or bank to stop you from sending/receiving Bitcoin.
Meh, pretty good problem to have. Sell a bitcoin, get 5,000$ . Sweetness.
I'd guess an individual with that many bitcoins could arrange to extend the limit for exchange withdrawals and cash out in a few months. Although I don't have personal knowledge of withdrawal limits, I doubt it would take the rest of your life.
[removed]
To be fair, I don’t know this woman’s schedule or how popular and I’ve never listened to the music. But, if my financial adviser was like hey, you gotta show up and sing for a few hours because there’s this exchange taking off and it could be a good investment. Id probably do it. 
"Bitcoin has a liquidity problem for sure and some people have so much Bitcoin it would damage the currency if they sold all at once but anyone rational would spread it out.

Edit: I can't spell."
Reek reek it rhymes with weak
"Back when bitcoin was worth around $2, I had about 50 btc on a hard drive that crashed.  Tried to get it back, but it was gone.  I thought, that sucks, I'm out $100.

Now, seven years later, I _still think ""that sucks, was out $100"".  

I didn't lose $350k, I lost $100.  If I _kept_ it, I would have had $350,000, but I didn't have a crystal ball, so it's not worth beating myself up over.  "
"While it is of course possible, I think that realistically the chances of it going that way are extremely low.

Everyone seems to be aware that the more acceptance bitcoin gets, the greater the value; but what seems to be somehow less often talked about is that the more acceptance it gets, the lower the volatility.

I personally think we're already at a point where the value of bitcoin is almost (but still not quite) large enough for it to be a 'safe' investment, and by the time that the bottom of the typical dips is around $20k USD, I expect many others will see it that way as well.

There is still a lot of speculation of course and there will be periods where 'mass panic' causes larger swings, but those early days where single whales could influence the market significantly are already well behind us.

My long term expectation for the value of bitcoin (measured against something stable, not other currencies) is roughly an S-curve with some wild swinging along the way making it fuzzy.  I also think there is a reasonable chance that it'll significantly overshoot the top of the S curve before coming down, bouncing a little, and eventually settling at a reasonably stable top.  There will therefore be people who sell that one and only 'real bubble' who will do well out of it.  I won't be one of them, because I don't believe that I'm capable of timing that and will be quite happy with the stable settled price.

It's true of course that I could change my opinion in the future.  And if I do, I'll of course act on my opinion as it is at the time.  That might mean I sell at $20k or $50k or whatever; but right now, I don't see any sensible reason that I would.

My current view of fiat is that as an inflationary currency, I want to hold as little of it as possible.  Why hold something that just decreases in value over time?  But, since I still want to maintain liquidity, I won't put it all in ""hard assets"" that are difficult to sell quickly or in highly divisible units (e.g. real estate; selling a house to go grocery shopping is just stupid).  Bitcoin is the perfect thing for maintaining that liquidity.  I of course do hold other assets as well, but other than a ""just in case of emergency"" reserve of fiat (enough to keep me and my family with a roof over our heads and food in our bellies for around 12 months if we're frugal), all my liquidity is in bitcoin."
"What do you think people do in the stock market, futures market, options market etc etc lol

Gamble.."
"The best time to invest in a speculative bubble is when people who know nothing about it want to throw their money at it.

STRAIGHT TO THE MOON"
One option to buy Bitcoin locally for cash is to use localbitcoins.com. You can meet a seller in person and  buy a small amount at first and if you have questions the seller might help you for a small fee or even free. 
Sign up at an exchange (such as Coinbase.com) link bank account or credit card and place an order. The rest you can figure out as you go and ask questions in places like this sub!
Maybe they thought she knew what she was talking about.
yeah but it was a second life gig so she didnt even have to move her ass
I call it speculation more than investment. Many people are buying it solely because they believe that it will be more valuable in the future, not because of any interest or dividend payments. That is pure speculation
"I mined mine at $20, and I'm still holding ;)

> Id be willing to bet the number is very small.

It is indeed."

When you put loan money to someone, they pay you periodically. That’s not the loan getting more valuable, that’s an interest payment. When you hold stock, the company pays you periodically. That’s not the stock getting more valuable, that’s a dividend payment. Those payments give those assets worth beyond the face value. If I buy a bond thinking I’ll be able to sell it for more later but the market for them crashes, I can just collect the coupon payments until it matures. You don’t have that option with bitcoin, its price is entirely dependent on its very volatile face value. That’s speculation. 
Individual bitcoins can be divided up to 100 million times. At least thats what I just read somewhere a little bit ago. 
"Well, the comment I was replying to was saying Bitcoin had a liquidity problem, in the context of someone selling a significant fraction of its total distribution. My point is that if you hold a significant fraction of anything, and you dump it, the market will feel it. I wouldn't describe that as a Bitcoin liquidity problem. In my view, that's a function of oversupply - which anything can be affected by. 

I'm not taking the broad position that Bitcoin is the same as the USD, but that would be an interesting discussion. "
"> But fiat doesn't have worth based solely on scarcity, no?

I think ""only worth what people are willing to sell you for them"" is true of both btc and dollars (since 1963?), since there's no one who promises to accept any particular exchange rate in the future for either of them. The differences would be that 1) the dollar is actually stable and 2) the btc money supply is fixed, unless ""everyone"" decides to change that."
"fiat does have a worth based on scarcity. It's just that scarcity is managed by central banks, interest rates, gdp of the economy, and the willingness to spend by firms and consumers.

Bitcoin has no bank or government controlling what it does. If you managed to trade 1 billion in bitcoin to USD, the worth of bitcoin would take a big dip. And there would be nothing to control that dip.

So if she had that $1.5billion bitcoin. The last 3rd of it would be worth exponentially less than the first 3rd."
The Bitcoin is still there. They don't go anywhere or move. They just can't be accessed. Imagine a vault with a lock that you can't unlock no matter what you do. Do the contents disappear because you lost the key? Nope. But the total supply is now less too. 
Yup. Lost forever. Fortunately bitcoins are highly divisible so even if there was only one bitcoin left it could be used for world commerce but we'd all be dealing in very tiny fractions of a bitcoin. The naming conventions would have to change.

"> Because the value of bitcoin is not based solely on speculation.

There needs to be a distinction between *value* and *price* IMO. Bitcoin derives value from being a store of wealth but also being available to use as a currency. Someone mentioned a day or two back that the price has shot up 5x in the past six months but transaction counts have remained essentially unchanged. Whether using it as a currency or as a store of wealth both would involve transactions, yet the transaction count is stable. 

So the price is currently being driven by speculation and holding not usage. Which implies it will come back down after some exogenous shock. The question then is what will the new equilibrium price be, which I suspect will be above its previous ~$1k ceiling but less than the $5-7k range lately. But who knows. That is all predicated on the current price being the top of the bubble, which has been the prediction for whatever the current price is for months now. "
"Pfft, I reached out from the primal consciousness before I was even an zygote and said, ""Mom, get on this shit, today.""

Tattooed it on? That's... really clever actually. 
"bitcoin and any emerging currency goes through a string of bubbles while it's in ""price seeking mode"". Bitcoin likely has 3 or 4 more to get through, what's more interesting is the exponential size of each bubble. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1co_YWwDpXg

they are splitting the ledger to test a new blockchain protocol that may or may not be successful as bitcoin scales up."
"What if the world ends tomorrow? What if climate change puts miami 1m underwater? What if I forgot to lock the door when i left the house?

I use strategy to balance risk and reward in my life. I am not suggesting that anyone put their life savings in bitcoin but if the biggest regret of your life was not buying BTC 6 years ago and you still haven't spent 30 minutes to make  a bitcoin wallet and put $50 in then you're gonna be sat like a plum for some time"
"There has been one true bubble in the history of bitcoin and that was in 2013 when the price soared past $1000 because of manipulation by the owner of Mt.Gox. Bitcoin lost most of its value when this bubble popped. It was such a trauma that the price took a couple of years to recover. Bitcoin is much more healthy now that there are many exchanges all around the globe.

There have been crashes on a fairly regular basis, typically because of scary news. These crashes have done a decent job at showing that the price is grounded in reality. Every single recent crash has been resorbed quickly because investors believe in the utility and potential of the technology enough to keep their bitcoins and because the influx of new investors continues to grow. The technology is innovative and objectively good. The rising price has put bitcoin on the radar of regular people. The Internet saw the same type of growth when it started becoming mainstream as opposed to just a den for nerds in the early 2000s.

Bitcoin isn't splitting in two. The original bitcoin will continue to account for nearly all the capital. An alternative cryptocurrency based on bitcoin will be created and most likely fail. A group is trying to hijack the development of bitcoin from the developers that are trusted by a majority of users. Bitcoin can easily weather attacks like these and has done so in the past. The only drawback is that it's a bit technical and that investors will have to be cautious about who they trust for a little while.

If this attack fails, it's unlikely that there will be other attacks of this magnitude in the future. If the attack unexpectedly succeeds, investors who haven't taken a stand won't be losing their capital since their bitcoins will exist in both cryptocurrencies. Investors who take a stand by selling their bitcoins from the cryptocurrency they don't believe in while keeping their bitcoins from the cryptocurrency they believe in will even have an opportunity to earn some free money like they did with BCH (bitcoin cash)."
I completely agree. Bitcoin is entirely unsuitable as an investment. But the biggest mistake of someone's life  is something that stays with them, and most people make efforts to prevent similar repeats. Yet this guy doesn't even know how to make a wallet...!

Financial responsibility is a part of it. But really the main issue is the fucking huge wealth divide. Seriously you are fucking poor as fuck.

The amount these people have is vast and almost beyond comprehension.
I just used it to buy heroin so I never had any for long. But my preferred market shut down with 3 BTC in my wallet and I could really use that right now.
"> Same. I knew about it 5 years ago & synced a wallet even. Was living paycheck to paycheck though, so couldn't afford any. 

5 years ago you could have just used your PC to mine.  GPU mining was still a thing then.  That didn't really end until 2013 when the first ASICs went online."
"But bitcoin isn't anyone, so that doesn't really line up.

Look, I get what you are trying to say... but painting ""bitcoin"" as a ""scam"" is just naive and foolish, because it is a protocol that has been going on for 8 years now, which some of the greatest minds in finance, economics, computer science, and mathematics working to get to where we are today, and were we will be in 25 years, and this momentum is just getting rolling. Falling into the mental trap that bitcoin is a scam without even looking into what it is (which if that was the case, I doubt you would still believe it was a scam), just because some 16 year old is foolish and made some money on speculation is the equivalent of marking Microsoft as a scam in 2001 because it was part of the dot com bubble. There's plenty of dumbasses who made money on the dot com bubble as well.

I urge you you actually spend some time learning exactly what bitcoin is and more importantly what it *isn't* before you just write it off, because its likely going to be one the biggest financial mistakes you make in your lifetime if you do."
Yeah, all the coin tips.  Heh.
I guess you're relegated to sticking your fiat under a mattress while it slowly diminishes in value then lol
Do you not also write with the blood of a pope?
I actually earn a living by buying broken drives in bulk and mining the data on them. It's pretty amazing what kind of stuff you find and the payout is great. 
Most places completely destroy the data when you recycle a PC so who knows how many Bitcoin have been lost total. Crazy to think about. 
He's got 17 years of Birthday and Christmas presents to catch up on, it'd be the least he could do. 
You have to buy them on an exchange. If you're in the US, coinbase is probably easiest. You could also use localbitcoins, which is like craigslist - you'll meet someone in person and trade cash for btc. It can be sketchy (like any in-person trade), but it's how I got started.
Yeah but now he could buy heroin deluxe lmao. 
Not like it's stopped me so far.
If you still got 100+ coins you're nearly a millionaire already fam, you're doing alright
You're braver than me openly admitting to that amount of BTC.
"Notice: The Zimbabwe dollar has been suspended indefinitely. More info ▶

Guess I ought to get in the habit of reading those more info arrows, I might have understood the joke and not looked like an idiot today.

Again, I’m pro-Bitcoin and anti-bitcoin scammers 
But only so many transactions can occur per second so you can't just split it into a billion tiny transactions and hope it goes well. 
Good point. I didn't think of that. Of course you wouldn't have to buy an entire Bitcoin to trade in them. 
"That's the rub. What's the point of a currency If it's a gamble? If it's not guaranteed to have any value it's not valuable. I know your point is ""well nothing's guaranteed"" but fiat is. You can play the philosophy game but as long as I can't get 1 million btc and turn that into 1 million USD(example currency) it's a gamble. I don't want to have to buy btc then turn it into USD then buy little things worth x amount and go and pawn that. Sure it's got the ability to buy things but as soon as someone with enough btc tries to exchange that it will end up creating a crash or drop, no? 

"
But then, the more that are found will surely bring the value back down again?
That's kind of a funny thought, there's probably hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars somewhere out there in dead hard drives in junk yards.

My point is we all had enough money to invest, invest in bitcoin etc.
2 Euro in January of 2011 would have bought 8.88 bitcoins, which today is worth 56,000 euro.
If compared to the relative cost of living, you are correct. I believe the cost of living in America has been deliberately inflated as yet another means to extract the wealth of its citizens. The American dream is no longer to profit from providing value to the marketplace, but rather to get government to force people to buy your shit whether they want it or not. 
So you could buy more heroin? They may have done you a favor.
"Came to say this... I started mining with my GPU, then was lucky enough to get a Butterfly Labs Jalapeno... mined 122 coins and intend to hang onto them... I was stupid enough to spend 4 of them when they peaked around $1100 some years ago, buying new PC parts.

"back in 2011 it was, download this program, install it, leave it running. Harder than just clicking a button on a web page but you could still literally do it and be clueless. It did mostly nothing most of the time, every once in a while it'd add a number to your total like +0.13120128 BTC.

Basically I left my PC on 24/7 for a few months. If I was gaming I turned off the mining app. If I wasn't gaming I let it run (while I was asleep or at work). At the end of those months I had maybe $50 worth of bitcoin and probably spent $30 on electricity.

The PC I used was a single or dual core Athlon with a fanless video card. Nothing monstrous. Not even strong enough to play the top grade first person shooters at 1024x768.

I did it and then ignored it for 6 years or so. Never realized what it would become. $50 in 2011 turns into thousands of dollars today."
Depressing fact of the day: Investing just $1 into bitcoin back in 2010 would be worth over $90,000 today.

I have the money to buy Bitcoin but it feels like a bubble. I don't want to invest say a $100,000 in Bitcoin now only for it to nose dive.
"Sadly you can.  Let's say you had $20 you blew on a Pizza back in late 2010.  You could have bought somewhere around 80 bitcoins.  That'd be worth $576,000 today.

Bitcoin is/was a risky investment.  Most risky investments do not pay off."
Same. I knew about it 5 years ago & synced a wallet even. Was living paycheck to paycheck though, so couldn't afford any. It's a real testament to living a financially responsible life so that when opportunities arise, you actually can afford to invest in them. 
I remember when people gave out bitcoin for free. 
Just think of how much those ephemeral experiences were worth today!

Is it something as simple as just going to a webpage, clicking a “mine” button and just leave it running?"
EXACTLY. It is still VERY early. We are about to see just the BEGINNING of mainstream investment $$$ coming into Bitcoin via SME futures contracts, and soon ETF’s, etc. The floodgates will open up and nobody should be surprised to see Bitcoin trading at $25K, then $50K, and beyond. Eventually, if just 1-2% of the world’s investment dollars are in Crypto Currencies, we will see a market cap of 10-20X the current levels. Furthermore, at that time, most people will be trading Bits and Satoshi’s, not full Bitcoins, because by then those denominations will be worth enough for everyday purchases. VERY EARLY indeed! 😉👍

"Lol. There are exchanges that allow much more than 10k at a time to be sent to a bank account. And you can buy stuff directly with Bitcoin too without ever changing it to fiat. You would need to spend your billion dollars all at once? 10k a day wouldn't be enough?

Besides, this is a hypothetical situation. Who has thousands of Bitcoin sitting in a wallet? Not many people."
Heh. Sell on multiple exchanges every day?
Yeah, that would mean using a Bentley for weeks before getting a new one, gross. 
"Whatever. Spend your money however you'd like. But the fact that all you cryptoheads keep trying to get every one you know to buy into this stuff, thereby increasing the value of your own investment, reeks of Ponzi or pyramid nonsense.

"Sure, like I'd mentioned, I think that the increased attention is a net positive. But I'm concerned that all of the new interest in cryptocurrencies has been primed in a counterproductive way.

When the bottom falls out, will the interest last? Are the people who are getting into crypto now ever actually use it as a medium of exchange or will they always see it as nothing more than a means of speculation?

The very best thing for a currency is for it to move around and change hands as much as possible. I'm concerned that the future of cryptocurrency is going to involve a painful, shaky process where people will need to stop thinking of it as the hot new speculative investment and start thinking about its actual merits. I'm worried that is going to be a more difficult process than simply having sold people on those merits to begin with."

"
I'm confused by your statement. People buy it because they believe it will increase in value,  not because they believe it will increase in value,  is basically what you just said. 
I think you are correct that it is technically possible. However I don't see this really benefitting anyone. In fact many bitcoiners like the idea of an immutable blockchain, and a known currency creation rate. How many people bought Bitcoin assuming lost bitcoins would remain lost. It's a selling point. Adding/replacing bitcoins is breaking the promise of CREATING only 21 million coins. I don't believe there was ever a mention of MAINTAINING a level of 21 million coins.
OTC trades, my friend. Exchanges can facilitate them
The fact that there is such a low number of bitcoins out there (around 20 million), means that any major trade would have a significant impact on their individual worth. You would *definitely* have to mete them out over months/years probably to see close to the return you'd hope for. 
"I think you're overestimating the extent of this ""problem"" 

She has to hire someone to help her off load $1.5Billion worth of currency. Oh noes. At the end of the day she would have walked away with like a Billion in cash"
Somehow, I think I'd rather take the money and deal with it.
I don't know where people get the idea that bitcoin gets its value from being traded. Bitcoin gets its value from the knowledge that others would trade for it, just like fiat
But fiat doesn't have worth based solely on scarcity, no? I'm just a casual interest person but saying the usd is the same as btc is disingenuous. One has much more trade behind it than that, no? 
Nah, that guy's gone years ago.  If I still had it, it would absolutely be worth it to send it in.
"> No offense, but people thought similar things about IT companies in 1999

No offence taken... but I'm confused by the statement.  Reputable IT companies (not just ""dot coms"") have generally done well since then.  There was a clear bubble when you look at stock price histories, but that doesn't mean they all just died.

> The internet was amazing and there was no way the new technology would fail.

Yep, that still seems to be true today in fact.

> Maybe you're right, or maybe another crash like the one in 2014 happens, only this time bitcoin never recovers and something else takes it place. I really don't see why you'd think that risk is extremely low.

Because the value of bitcoin is *not* based solely on speculation.  As I said in my post, there is a lot of speculation and it does cause volatility in the price - essentially mini-bubbles within the overall trend - but since there is inherent and unique value, the price should reflect this.

It is possible of course for the inherent and unique value to be replaced by something else, and so yes, it could all crash down to nothing.  However I don't see any practical way for that to happen at the moment.  The main value of bitcoin compared to other cryptocurrencies is the size of the network (making it inherently more secure because that's how blockchains work).  This is kind of a self-reinforcing factor for the most part and would take something pretty significant to change it.  If something comes along that actually does ""dethrone"" bitcoin, there should be enough warning signs to move my liquidity over to that instead, but again, I still can't see any realistic way for that to happen right now."
And also did you even read what the quote was?
Still wrong though, wasn't it the second life money?
That was nearly all the bitcoins in existence at the time. (I think there were around 5 million in existence back then. There's only 20 million today.) 
I was kicking my mum nonstop before being born to buy Bitcoin, but she didn't do it :(
I communicated to my mom via umbilical cord to buy Bitcoin.  That was 38 years ago.

once they hit like $700 each I moved to another more encrypted wallet (still burned to CD) Then I renamed a encrypted .rar to .jpg (attempt to be sneaky) and uploaded a 'pic' to gmail so I'd always have it.

Once it hit $3000 I got a Trezor, once it hit 6000 I got a 2nd Trezor.

Guess what I'll do when it hits 9, yup you guessed it another Trezor.


I have the 24 word seed tattooed on me and only my wife and I know the password.

Just curious, but doesn’t bitcoin have essentially a theoretical limit? If someone where to have like 200 bitcoins on a hard drive and the hard drive crashes and you can’t recover it, what happens to that 200 bitcoin? Does it just not exist anymore? Does 200 bitcoin get worked back into the algorithm or whatever it is that creates bitcoin? 
"No to mention how wasteful cryptomining is.

Crypto currencies seem like they have all the drawbacks of normal money, along with the massive waste of people running hundreds of video cards 24/7 for no productive reason.

Then for some reason they have a million excuses why it's okay.

Edit: You guys can get butthurt but it won't change the facts."
If they wanted that transaction to be confirmed within an hour or so, they'd have to pay about $5 in transaction fees, so I'd doubt that would be useful for them.

Welcome to the hype train. It only gets worse.
Kind of like this sub in 30 years. I could have invested in stocks but instead I bought these online currencies!
I heard this bullshit from a guy at my work who's financial adviser said this same exact thing. It's bullshit, there's plenty of places to trade, buys items, invest, whatever. Stop parroting this crap.

"Overhyped and overbought by people that don't fully understand what they are buying on the short term? Sure I'll grant you that.

Do you buy stocks and boss without first knowing the context of the market? Knowing debt levels, cash flows, PE ratio, etc? So why would you think bitcoin exists in a vacuum?

Take a look at some of the concepts in [this](https://unglueit-files.s3.amazonaws.com/ebf/05db7df4f31840f0a873d6ea14dcc28d.pdf) book, and you'll probably come away with a sobering reality check that you really aren't as smart as you think you are by ignoring this. "
"Yeah. It wouldn’t be that hard. There are large investment companies that deal in BTC day trading and other things. Former Fortess guy I think and an old school stock trader who made himself 20 million richer since January or so.

Anyways... All she would need to do is signs contract and rent would market move it for 20%.

Basically, on Wall Street when a large investor wants to get out of a company without crashing the price they hook up with one of these people.

They line up dozens if not hundreds of buyers at an agreed to price (usually lower but close to market value) and handle the transactions and keep the activity discreet so it just looks like a bunch of trades over a longer period of time than someone just dumping 10% of the company all at one time.

Also, investors usually never sell all their investments so she could go to one of these people on Wall Street and they would maybe sell $1 million per week in different exchanges over a 6 month period and so on to get maybe $100 million and maybe shift the rest around into other vehicles."
Well, she could just cash some small amount at a time.
You direct your team of traders to spread it around a little at a time without letting anyone know what you're doing, same as trying to unload your Enron stock in 2001.
"There are many options:
auction the coins like US marshals do
there are lots of over-the-counter (OTC) places you can agree large trades.
have a broker sell them for you over a period of time with an agreed strategy.
sell them yourself at places like the daily gemini auctions.

imo, it's all irrelevant, because the question is, should you sell?"

"As others have said, you could make many trades over a longer period of time.

Or you could find a single buyer and arrange the transaction outside of an exchange; e.g., you might talk to hedge funds or other institutional investors and figure out if they want your bitcoins."
These guys should look at the housing industry in the early 2000s. Hang onto your shit but be aware that there is a bubble and the bubble will pop
It's not a scam in the same way the lottery isn't a scam. I had a chance to buy a lottery ticket from a gas station I briefly walked by while on vacation that would have been worth over $10 million dollars and I still carry that heavy regret with me. It was an amazing opportunity that would have forever changed my life, and like an idiot, I completely passed it by. 
"I mean if i was investing all my money into bitcoin I'd be looking at any possible way to not have to throw myself off a building.

Bigger players join the fray the higher the price of bitcoin goes, more people that join the more recgonized it might be as a currency. None of which will give it any semblance of stability, because the coin has no physical value and the worth changes by the hour."

"you need to use three of these: \

Underscores form italics _like this_. \ Is used as an escape character to cancel the function of things like that.

None means the underscores aren't escaped (and there's no arm), so you get: ¯_(ツ)_/¯ 

One means you escaped the underscores so they show up, but your escape character is hidden : ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Two means you escaped the \ so it's not an escape character. So your underscores are gone again: ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

Three is just right. The third one escapes the underscores and the first one stops the second from being an escape character, so you get a full arm: ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯"
The market is expanding rapidly.

"Too many people are conflating the importance of having *some* kind of cryptocurrency with the validity of Bitcoin as an investment. It's completely specious reasoning and I'm positive that a lot of people who promote that line of thinking are willfully misleading for exactly the reasons you laid out. I don't think I'd call it a scam, per se, but I do believe that it's getting intentionally inflated to provide value for the fortunate few while the majority of people are left holding the bag.

I like that cryptocurrency has been getting more attention because of the success of Bitcoin, but I think that a substantial portion of that attention is entirely focused on the wrong thing. Cryptocurrency isn't a way to print money for yourself. The whole foundational purpose is to decentralize the medium of exchange. Instead, everyone's being told to just buy up Bitcoin and sit on it."
Lilly Allen she's a pop singer. The fear is a good song if your curious 
Say you want to buy Bitcoin today who do you think you're buying from? Someone selling Bitcoin for cash, if you couldn't turn Bitcoin into cash others couldn't turn cash into Bitcoin either.
Too bad for us, now she has to keep singing instead of early retirement.
I remember my girlfriend telling me we should buy $1,000 of them when they were 1c. We were completely broke,but knowing what I know now I would have bought them on a credit card. But hindsight is perfect, there's plenty of broke stock traders to prove that.
What? I am just sharing an article. 
People that bought at 3 cents sold at 10$ long ago.
2.5 billions dollars worth of Bitcoin were moved in the last 24 hours. You would have to put it on an exchange and link the exchange to your bank account.
On an exchange just like Euro or some other foreign currency :).
"One Bitcoin was worth less than a cent at that time (2009). On the free market today, that same single Bitcoin would trade for around $7000 usd. 

So if you simply held on to 200k worth of Bitcoin from 2009, which would be hundreds of thousands of Bitcoins, you would now own a very valuable collection of Bitcoin, which could be sold on currency exchange markets such as Coinbase, Kraken, etc. for USD cash."
It would be like someone offering you 200,000 dogecoins for your house today. Sure, 10 years from now it could be worth a fortune, but today it's a joke.

^^ that is what she said in 2014. But did she buy any Bitcoins then, after realizing she is an idiot? I doubt it.

IIRC, the first bitcoin ATM was actually *inside* Second Life, where you could trade Linden Dollars for BTC o_O
Schrute bucks
lol, thats only roughly $1,000 USD. Probably a drop in the bucket for what she makes. 
I would've done it simply for the lulz of a SL concert.
Who?
As a guy that knows nothing at all about bitcoins...would she be able to cash this in for real world currency like a dollar somewhere, had she taken the gig?

All these ""I had x btc in 2011-2012 that I sold and would be worth this much today"" are retarded. That's like saying oh man I could've bet correctly on every major sports event and be mega rich if I had known the future like I do now!! Oh man you're a fuckin genius if you know the future wow!"
It was Linden dollars from second life, not bitcoin. She didn't even understand the difference to this day
I have made similar bad decisions approximately 7 times. 2 most notable. In the year 1997 I had a chance to buy 10k worth of apple stock and when bitcoin was young I was offered 500 for my wow account.
"No, I'm not gonna ""fuck you"" for some bitcoins."
"And had it al send to Mt.Gox ....
"
But she would have needed the money on the spot to pay the overhead costs of the concert. Even if she wanted bitcoins. It doesn't mean that the lighting and sound people, roadies, bus driver etc. Would take bitcoin. And I don't she has a enough money to foot that bill completely. So her decision makes excellent financial sense
I know nothing about bitcoin. How would someone who has like 200k of it go about selling it for that much money?
hundreds of thousands of btc in 2009? was she contacted by satoshi?
I suppose it would have sounded even more ridiculous to her if they also said she couldn't sell them for another 8 years.
She turned down 200k in what would sound like monopoly money to anyone not in the know.  It seems pretty rational not to accept.
No need to shame the girl. Probably didn’t even know what bitcoin was at the time. 
"Moral of the story?

What’s the point of calling out all these stories about “what could have been”? It’s unhealthy enough for an individual to dwell on their own situations in this manner. It is strange that we like to do it on behalf of others, too.
Lastly time this popped up someone did their research and I think it turned out to be Linden dollars or the equivalent.

Forgive my ignorance here, but how easy is it to withdraw bitcoin for cold, hard cash?  Say this was true... who would honor the exchange?

I’ll pay you 200,000 South Korean Won right now to hold a three hour musical performance for me at my house
"Granted it’s all fun to poke at others... but we effectively all turned down Bitcoin in 2009 at 0.01 and effectively all bought the ‘million dollar pizza’.

Even if you were a kid, there was the Bitcoin faucet, Mining, and writing about BTC. Vitalik got his start not as CEO of Ethereum, but as a crypto blogger after losing too many games of Warcraft, and after much nudging from his father.

I think orginally Vit was taking BTC donations for articles, and I think in today’s values he received well over a million in donations, when he was about 15."
Well I can offer a hundred thousand Zimbabwean dollars then!
yeah but what if she sold the linden dollars and bought 1,000 dollars worth of bitcoin!
1.4 billion *
What’s the ratio of Schrute bucks to Stanley nickels?

Is she that bad?
Boo! ^says^reddit
Yeah op! You think you're some kind of wise guy, don't ya! Well I'll show you what we do to wise guys around here!
You are right , I probably overreacted , not the best choice of words on my part in trying to make my point , that people just didn’t know that bitcoin will be such a big hit in 2009 or even in 2011  and who can blame them . ., my apologies.  
Sharing, huh? Damn Commie! 
Schrute Bucks
I seriously doubt you could exchange 1 billion dollars worth of Bitcoin just like that
"200,000 DogeCoin (XDG) = 238.23 US Dollars (USD)

*^(i am not a bot)*"
And don't forget the possibility you would cash it out the second it becomes worth something. Who in their right mind would've thought bitcoin would become what it is today 8 years ago?
You have absolutely no idea what youre talking about.
Poor people can buy $1 worth if they want.
How is it too expensive? You can buy portions of bitcoins right?
"Shame on you! ;-)"
"Money isn't shit if what they're asking hurts you or costs you something else.

Use your imagination and stop treating Money like it *actually is literally everything else.*"
Ill give you 100,000 Vietnamese dong. 
How about monopoly money?
Dude this is a highly risk investment and anyone that thinks otherwise is a fool. Bitcoin isn't secured by any nation, firm, or precious metal. There's no Fed directing monetary policy. It's as fiat as money can be. I can remember when bitcoins were like 10 bucks, but the whole thing was shady as hell and looked like it could be made illegal at any second. One bill passing in Congress and they skyrocket. Do I wish I had bought some? Fuck yes I do. But I didn't forget how grim it looked for the whole venture and how unstable it continues to be.
Because there is 0% chance that fiat will go through hyper inflation and your family is broke in 50-100 years. The correct answer is you diversify into fiat, commodities, land and stocks in large steady corporations. I would also keep at least 10% in Bitcoin by that point. No way am I giving up something that made me a billionaire completely.

"You're not going to sell 1.4 billion in Bitcoin to people ""who like it"". That amount is literally unheard of. There's never been a liquidity of that amount in one time ever. Splitting it up into multiple transactions trying to sell to individuals would take ages.

Have you ever bought anything with bitcoin?  You should try it sometime, buy like 20 bucks worth and buy something.  It's the easiest thing ever.  The onpy real downside right now is high transaction costs, which is what the whole fork debate is about.
"The problem you are identifying is that BTC is by design deflationary. Since there's a finite amount and each block is harder to discover the value is going up and up and up. As much as inflation seems like it screws you over (I'm paying $1.89 for a soda that used to cost me $0.99) it encourages spending in an economy - why hold your money if money loses value sitting on the shelf, so to speak. BTC is the opposite - why spend today if it will continue to grow just by saving?

You see stories about people that could have made fortunes by buying in early but what about those that used it as currency early? Those first users that bragged about being able to buy a pizza with BTC probably paid $7000 USD by today's exchange rate for that pizza. "
Which would be very easy to trade for cash
What happens to lost wallets? Are the currency units lost for good?
Cool, so just do that 24 hours a day 7 days a week for the rest of your life and you just might get all your cash.
They can be sold at one of several online cryptocurrency exchanges. Also, they can be sold in person for cash. See localbitcoins.com.

"I'm not sure about that. ""Willing to lose"" is always a weird term in my opinion. Frankly, I'm not really willing to lose anything more than €50. Nor am I willing to lose €500 or €5000. Granted €50 is the same as going out for dinner with my girlfriend, so it's not like it's going to bankrupt me, but I still don't like losing it.

The thing is you have to acknowledge that you're still holding Bitcoin. If the price dips you haven't ""lost"" that money (fiat), just as you haven't ""made"" it if the Bitcoin price goes up but you don't sell.

I'm not willing to *lose* €50 for no good reason, but I am okay to *spend* €50 to go out to a restaurant on a Tuesday for no good reason.

Likewise, I'm not willing to *lose* €50 on crypto but I am willing to *spend* €50 on crypto because I believe in it."
There's always times you want to sell just to cash out, congrats on the 21 BTC

"Nobody can find a buyer??? You're definitely exaggerating a bit there. But yeah I understand the panic in those ""bitcoin is dying"" situations"
"If you can actually predict the market why wouldn't you just sell right before a price crash and then use the profits to buy even more?

If you can't predict the market you're just gambling. Which is fine, but don't pretend there's any strategy to it."
"LOve oR LuSt

I'd like to dabble but I haven't a clue how to go about it! 
She thought it was Bitcoin when she tweeted, but it was later found out that it was actually Linden dollars. That information is publicly available somewhere on the internet. The news outlet didn't bother to research this.
200K <insert unit here> is only worth about $9 in Vietnam and $15 in Indonesia. Venezuelan bolivars are comparatively much more expensive (10 to the dollar).
You do understand the Bolivar is worth less per dollar than WoW gold is, yes?
care to explain how it is a scam?
"You don't have to buy BTC for 6 Grand, you can just buy part of a coin...

Poor people can absolutely still buy it"
Bitcoins weren't even traded until 2010. And the plan all along (which is still in place) was to never have more than 21 million bitcoins in existence. Only ~half of those have been mined so far. So you couldn't ever have purchased $200K worth of them at 1 cent apiece. They were already worth 40 cents apiece in 2010.
At least with the lottery you know your odds of winning (slim as those odds are). With cryptocurrencies we have no idea what’s going to happen.
Of course you can.
Not really, but you could sell it to other people who like bitcoin.
if you invested everything in bitcoin a year ago, you would be able to buy that building before you jump off of it 
It's similar to holding 1.4b in apple or Google shares in that she would not be able to exchange it all for fiat (eg usd) currency in a day. If she tried the price of bitcoin would collapse as her as a bitcoin seller outpace all buyers globally. If she sold say, 100k usd worth a month over several years the price would likely sustain this. But at the same time it would probably not be a great investment because the bitcoin price is likely to increase and the buying power of usd is likely to decrease due to inflation and the government printing more usd. 
Iirc, Tesla accepts Bitcoin.
There are a number of exchanges. Tho you could just buy stuff with them... Dumping 200k in one go would just  be silly. 
"Kinda sorta. In London, a very popular city, I do often see places that accept Bitcoins. I've seen it range from flat rentals (I.E. Pay your rent in Bitcoin) to restaurants (I.E. Pay for your food in Bitcoins) to ATMs (I.E. Pay the ATM bitcoins and you get GBP).

Saying that, it's still not an every day, or even every week occurrence. Unless I'm specifically going somewhere that accepts Bitcoins, it's normally once every 1-3 months I see somewhere that accepts it.

Online, however, I see it literally daily. Reddit accepts it for gold, Steam accepts it for games, Newegg and Scan accept it for stuff (I believe), etc..."
There are cards that allow you to buy directly with bitcoin such as /r/tenx so you might never need to cash out.
"The problem with BTC is that it's labelled a currency but traded as a stock. That's why few places accept it. What would you rather I give you, $135 in cash or one stock in John Deere?

If it doesn't stabilize then it will never be a real currency, and if it doesn't become a real currency then it'll become as valuable as Beanie Babies. That's the long and short of it."
There’s a super car dealership that will trade bitcoin, so you could spend your massive bitcoin wealth on Lamborghinis.
There are several online exchanges to buy and sell Bitcoin for national currencies. For airline tickets (cheapair.com, expedia.com) electronics, computers (newegg.com), VPN services, mobile  minutes (sobit.jp), restaurant meals, gold and silver coins (Amagimetals.com, milesfranklin.com) etc. 
Selling 1% of the market in one shot would cause FAR more of a crash than just 1-5% lol. 
What are you insinuating?
Unless she has a savvy financial assistant. 
"If it isn't easy, you're probably over-invested.

The old statement about ""don't put in more than you're willing to lose"" exists for a reason.  If I were to suddenly lose access to all my BTC, or if BTC somehow dropped to zero with no chance of recovery (fatal flaw discovered in system, etc), I'd be disappointed of course, but it wouldn't negatively affect the quality of my life or that of my family.

To put that in context, I say that as someone that holds somewhat over 1 one-millionth of all the bitcoins that will ever exist (i.e. I'm in the ""21 BTC club"").  It might make me extraordinarily wealthy one day, and it also might not.  The only thing that's guaranteed is that if I were to sell them (even with the idea of maybe buying back in later at a lower price), then I'd be risking losing that chance.

Therefore holding is extremely easy no matter what the price does.  Either it goes up, and I'm happy seeing myself get closer to complete financial independence; or it goes down and financial independence looks a bit further away again.  But neither of those situations creates any pressure or desire to sell."
Yup try holding onto them when the market dips down to a 3 month low with no end in sight and people are losing their investments and nobody can find a buyer. Panic is very real.
DAMN. 
I made my first Bitcoin purchase with Linden Dollars, did PayPal>Linden>Bitcoin was upset at the time because I lost so much in the conversion process. In the long run it didn't turn out so bad. 
"As a non-investor, when you see headlines talking about ""new record high"" for a currency, followed by arm-chair economists spamming the internet with ""the bubble is going to pop any day now"", it seems like a bad time to invest because surely it's just going to go down from there."
but she said in a tweet that it was bitcoins, so was she misinformed or the news outlet? 
I'm not sure I want to get to the point where I turn down a gig for hundreds of thousands of *any* currency...even Venezuela or US
And since it was Linden dollars and not Bitcoin that means that she didn't miss out on $1.4 billion. She missed out on *maybe* $1k lol.
That's pretty crazy. Makes a lot of sense though 
Stanley nickles
Hi how does someone actually sell their Bitcoin?
"Of course you should sell. 

You have over a billion dollars all locked into one extremely high risk investment. Of course you would want to liquidate the vast majority of your bitcoin to invest in much safer ventures and set your family up for generations. "
"Wow, didn’t realize people still knew this little about Bitcoin; I thought most understood it by now. There are several exchanges that do hundreds of millions of volume per day . And a lot of stores take bitcoin now, Overstock. Com and Microsoft are probably the biggest . Here’s a list of stores who accept it https://99bitcoins.com/who-accepts-bitcoins-payment-companies-stores-take-bitcoins/"
If you trade on an exchange, every little trade is not a bitcoin transaction. The exchange typically do these trades off chain. 
Exactly. Re: [bagholding](https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagholder)
All of the engineers and computer scientists working on blockchain projects clearly have no idea what they are doing. /s

"Not the guy you responded to, but it's a little weird to call these sorts of stories out as frequently as they are. The same sort of thing applies to practically any lucrative investment ever given hindsight; it's nothing unique to bitcoin."
I never said it *was* a scam. I was saying users of this sub are *treating it like a scam* by upvoting bullshit articles.
"> This story just feel more like circle jerking to me.

Well that too.

But the fact is if everyone held on to Bitcoin back then and didn’t trade them in exchange for money/goods/services, then the price never would’ve risen so much. So all stories like this are absolute bullshit."
Reminds me of late 1920s Wall Street.
I mean, like any form of exchange there are pro’s and con’s, but with bitcoin too many people are ignoring the negatives and promoting to people as a surefire investment, when it’s still a speculative investment. And if it gets too expensive then that could create more competition with other crypto-currencies which would saturate the market and lead to bubble-like conditions.
30? make it more like 3
"Dude ive watched the price of bitcoin go from 12 bucks to 200 buck to 2000 to 7000. And all along the way ive heard people say, ""oh its a scam. It wont last. It wont hit 100 bucks. It wont hit 1000 bucks. It wont hit 10,000 bucks"", and they are wrong every time. 

Then i look at the financial institutions, Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, and they are all accepting bitcoin with open arms.

So tell me, what knowledge about bitcoin do you have that Merrill Lynch doesnt? Why do you think its a scam and the financial institutions dont? "
I mean, it mirrors the trajectory of every bubble ever, from stock tulips, to tech stocks, to housing, to Ponzi schemes, etc.
"You are and idiot, but not for the reasons you think you are. You made the right decision not buying a lottery ticket because you had no information that would suggest that ticket would win and making decisions based of no information is what idiots do. The fact that you actually think you had a chance at winning the lottery and are now mad at yourself is what makes you wrong 

The point is the lottery is a scam, just because someone walks away with money doesn't mean it isn't a scam  "
Remind me! 30 years
