"I remember back in 2012,when I was just fourteen, me and a good friend of mine became very curious about Bitcoin, and decided to invest some of our hard earned money in it. Worked a couple of weeks for the shittiest tips, spent all the money on cards and pizza, and repeated the process a couple of times. We never took the chance in the end. We laughed about it a year later, saying that we definitely should work and do it again, while both knowing what the results of our hard work would be. 

As a result, we totally forgot about it,cause he later had lung cancer, and passed away in February last year. He was an extremely optimistic person, who died young, too young. I still mourn him to this day.

The whole point of this comment, was that I recently heard my sixteen year old brother talking about Bitcoin and how he wanted to invest in it,and it's been a while since I saw him so excited for something. But nothing hurts me more than the memory of one happy moment, that ended up as a best friend being buried under my eyes. 
Wishing the best to all investing it, I'm just letting out something that I thought was too stupid to tell anyone else
