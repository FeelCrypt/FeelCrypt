You're trying to buy low I see.
Do you think it'll go back down to 10c so I can afford to buy in?
You're going to break my damn coaster bot.

Upvoted.. if the price goes up i will never doubt you again. If we tank im sending the sentinels! :)
I could barely stop myself from checking a chart.
Good one
I sold 0.1btc. I think it will be the last crash before 80k
grow up
Is anyone else excited for a dip down to $8500 to pick up some coin?  That idea used to worry me, but I've gotten to a point that I have no huge worry that it won't be going back up again permanently in the possibly near future.
But it did..
"How many times do we need the same memes posted every time price moves? Probably a 1000 copies of this same meme floating around in just this crypto sub alone.

&#x200B;

What's the line of thought here from OP?

""BTC price moved again! I better get on reddit stat (!) and post the rollercoaster meme again. That way, people are aware of what the price is doing."""
"Why?

Ninja Edit: why would you specifically want to confuse the Bitcoin community on Reddit? Seems like a dick move."
It just confused me into thinking that my monitor is upside down.
Nice. I'll play.
Bear trap
Back to 20k??.. then it's not confusing!
Why?
But then they're going to sell even faster.
Stop playin ...
... or are you a time traveler?

I got an e-mail today from Coinstar saying you can now buy Bitcoin at the Coinstar machines in grocery stores. You can't exchange your coins for Bitcoin, but you can insert something like $2,400 in bills into the machine and get a receipt for Bitcoin.
Think about it going down and it will, maybe it’s a double bluff
This is an accurate representation of Litecoin right now.  :D
To the round cheese wheel in the sky!
Wait my wire didn't arrive yet
HODL
 Up or down
If you turn your phone sideways he's just having a good time

How does this work if everyone is able to read English words that are located in the title?
Guys, ill just let you know when im going to buy and sell as i always make the wrong decisions. You do the opposite and hopefully some of you appreciate my dumbass enough to break me off a piece. :P
It literally looks like he is falling -_-
Literally bought more earlier today when I saw it hit £7600 and was excited for my lambo when I saw this
TO THA MOOOOON
Question, I had bought a very small amount of ETH a while back just to see if it would do anything. Would it be worth it to exchange it for BTC?
best post of 2019, by far
It is working! Click harder!!
Rick, that sounds like a pump and dump .... with extra steps....
WOOOOOOOW, price gone up???
Nice try
This meme was posted. Price is going down again. Every time this meme is posted the price is dropping soon after.

So I’m probably like a bunch who are waiting for their paycheck to buy more but this is low.
