You're trying to buy low I see.
Wait my wire didn't arrive yet
Literally bought more earlier today when I saw it hit £7600 and was excited for my lambo when I saw this
 Up or down
If you turn your phone sideways he's just having a good time
Fall more
How does this work if everyone is able to read English words that are located in the title?
Guys, ill just let you know when im going to buy and sell as i always make the wrong decisions. You do the opposite and hopefully some of you appreciate my dumbass enough to break me off a piece. :P
It literally looks like he is falling -_-
Stop playin ...
But then they're going to sell even faster.
Why?
Back to 20k??.. then it's not confusing!
Do you think it'll go back down to 10c so I can afford to buy in?
You're going to break my damn coaster bot.

Upvoted.. if the price goes up i will never doubt you again. If we tank im sending the sentinels! :)
I could barely stop myself from checking a chart.
Good one
I sold 0.1btc. I think it will be the last crash before 80k
grow up
Is anyone else excited for a dip down to $8500 to pick up some coin?  That idea used to worry me, but I've gotten to a point that I have no huge worry that it won't be going back up again permanently in the possibly near future.
But it did..
"How many times do we need the same memes posted every time price moves? Probably a 1000 copies of this same meme floating around in just this crypto sub alone.

&#x200B;

What's the line of thought here from OP?

""BTC price moved again! I better get on reddit stat (!) and post the rollercoaster meme again. That way, people are aware of what the price is doing."""
Question, I had bought a very small amount of ETH a while back just to see if it would do anything. Would it be worth it to exchange it for BTC?
"Why?

Ninja Edit: why would you specifically want to confuse the Bitcoin community on Reddit? Seems like a dick move."
Agreed, but that's more of a btc trader. You could increase your holding by playing the surges and dips, but unless you have more than 1, I wouldn't recommend it.
Yeah I was going to say... I'm always checking to see if it's buy the dip prime time.
This is an accurate representation of Litecoin right now.  :D
I have not, it's honestly been a while since I've looked back into Bitcoin.
Think about it going down and it will, maybe it’s a double bluff
Dump et ageen
Boo hoo
I would think so mainly on how much more widespread Bitcoin is over etherium

"> How many times do we need the same meme's posted every time price moves? 

Yes."
It's not about letting people know the price is moving. It's about letting people know that you know that the price is moving. It also easier then doing any of the things that strengthen ₿. Like minning or God forbid spending a single satoshi. Just keep typing HODL on the same 5 memes that'll show people that your a real deal bitcoiner
Honestly, if you're a hodler, checking the price regularly is truly a disservice to your life.
Lord McAfee has been nabbed by the mafia we call law enforcement.
I'm having deja vu
Should I buy now?
Me too, nothing really gets me to check the price until I see some variation of this gif or a meme
No u
You're a nice guy.
"Hi u/Red_Bagpipes, thanks for tipping u/khaotickk **100** satoshis!

Thanks! I need to read into how to transfer these into a hard wallet.
Since posting it went up at least $50 USD. Coincidence?! Maybe...
" ""Bogdanoff... DUMP EET"""
I understand this reference!
Maybe more upvotes will make the price even higher.
Sweet

This sub is just retard
Unless you're trying to buy more at the dip.
Lightning network is actually best for hot wallets, rather than offline cold storage like hardware wallets. Have you tried out any of the new LN wallet apps, like Blue Wallet or Lightning Labs mobile wallet?
I got an e-mail today from Coinstar saying you can now buy Bitcoin at the Coinstar machines in grocery stores. You can't exchange your coins for Bitcoin, but you can insert something like $2,400 in bills into the machine and get a receipt for Bitcoin.
That's just a smart way of targeting your DCA buys. Just because you buy regularly, doesn't mean you need to set it on a timer. Waiting a couple days for a nice steep downward movement is a good way to earn a few bucks on volatility.
HODL
It looks like he's falling backwards.
"*upvotes* 

Checks bitcoin price

*cries*"
:) :(
I has the confuse
This meme was posted. Price is going down again. Every time this meme is posted the price is dropping soon after.
Nice try
It just confused me into thinking that my monitor is upside down.
Nice. I'll play.
Bear trap
So I’m probably like a bunch who are waiting for their paycheck to buy more but this is low.
It is working! Click harder!!
......no
It'll reach $1,000,000 any day now guys  just hodl and praise McAfee!
WOOOOOOOW, price gone up???
I like this gif with Bitcoin, always makes me smile.
Need to get my first bit cones
To the round cheese wheel in the sky!
To the Earth!
Rick, that sounds like a pump and dump .... with extra steps....
and now this is in /r/all
Lots of cool stuff going on :) if you want to try spending on LN, bitrefill.com has gift cards to regular places. You can buy stuff you need anyways while experimenting and learning.
TO THA MOOOOON
