LOL this happens to me. I hate trying to trade and drive.
"u/PineappleFund I'm really passionate about the amazing [Librespace foundation](https://libre.space/) a non profit organisation seeking to democratise space and develop space technologies outside of the defense/war/for profit model. They have achieved LOADS... They developed the open source and now global Satnogs platform which is a network of groundstations enabling reliable and independent ways of collecting even more scientific data from satellites.... They built and launched UPsat a small form satellite (Currently zipping around our planet once every 90 minutes on orbit!) The development of UPsat is about creating an open source reliable cubesat satellite platform for EVERYONE to use.
From meeting some of this team recently and chatting to them on their forum they are currently researching the development of an open source space launch system for nanosatellite payloads (think ROCKETS!) and are working on ways to increase their engagement and outreach activities with many different communities globally. They are damn inspiring...and all work really hard so please check them out and consider them! Cheers"
