Why are people losing their minds over this?does everybody but me have a fair amount of these bitcoins or something?
I can't believe it's here!  I've been in the game since before 100 dollars and it feels like I've been rewarded for holding strong during the crash from 1200!!?
Dam too bad I'm poor so this doesn't even matter to me, only makes me depressed that I could have flipped some money but cannot since I have no money. 
This sub is my own little taste of the 80s. How many of y'all dipping your balls in coke rn?
Hyped for $15k?
REMEMBER THIS DATE 11/28/17, THEN REMIND EVERYONE ABOUT IT WHEN BTC HITS 100K, AND AGAIN AT 1MILLION.

okay guys.. lets not get to the front page... KEEP IT LOW KEY SO I CAN ACCUMULATE MORE
"Is it too late for me to invest in Bitcoin? And if not, how do I get started? 
Asking for a friend. "
"Wasn't it at like 3k a few weeks ago?

God damn I wish I invested in this shit."
And my friend tried to explain it when it was $2 each
"I evidently have 2btc from a cryptovirus coverage account that is not being used. 

Sounds like it's time for a withdrawl. "
I feel a fully-integrated member of this community, and this feels like an important milestone in the internet's history. So excited to be a part of this, for the ages :-)
Congratz to all owners.
I'm worth less than a virtual penny.
See you all at 15k ..... on New Years Eve :D
"Even if this ""bubble"" bursts by 80% I've still made a greater profit than my traditional investments"
Congratulations to all Hodlers!
Got in on Litecoin at $86 😂😂😂
just a sec imma go slap the shit out of my 2013 self
Yeah impressive and all but we all know the best crypto currency is still Dogecoin
We are a part of history folks!
"What a great day it is!  Wish I hadn't sold most of it a year ago, but still hodling 0.2, and glad to be part of this community!

See you all at 100k!"
Just bought my first 200 bucks worth. Either way this goes, I'm ecstatic to be a part of history. Thanks for being in it with me, family. 
now let the bubble fear begin. the news are crazy about it.
It seems not long ago we were at 2k.. There is no moon just hodl
TAKE NO PRISONERS!!!!!
CHOOO CHOOOO MOTHERFUCKERS FUCK THE MOON WE GOIN TO NEPTUNE BABY
So y'all motherfickers making money or something. Anyone else feeling retarded

Hey /u/LeeWallis,


This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts."
Well I just jumped on. Wish I did It 12 months ago. $100 each in bitcoin, litecion and Etherium

Not to be a buzzkill here but as someone who remembers when it was pennies on the dollar and did not invest, “fuckkkkkkkkkkkkkj me”
"I am waaaaaaay too late to invest now. 

Edit: big thanks for replies but now i have that fear of what goes up must come down and probably due to government interference."
What's this movie I need to see tho?
Gdax turned into matrix right now...
It is going to just get crazier. Hitting milestones every couple of days now. I don’t think it would be a stretch to predict $20k by the end of this year.
What’s causing this recent spike?
Did it really gain $1000 usd in just a few days? I’ve been thinking about getting in on it for a while and if it’s climbing like this I might need to. 
ELI5 bitcoin please...what is it? Where did it come from? How does something digital that can be created digitally have any real value? Are there fake coins? Who make them? Can whoever make them just give themselves unlimited amounts? If you buy some, where does your money go, who gets it?
"I'm so fascinated to find out how unstable this bull market is at this point. 

So much blind dead money coming in so fast."
So when's that guy eating his teste?

This is an historic moment for humanity!

"In this thread: 

-People who own Bitcoin and are elated. 

-People who have no idea what is going on and are curious

-People who are super salty they passed on buying"
Wow. Just Wow. The haters on here. Even in Australia they are accepting Bitcoin to pay for, rent, fuel, property, food, even fucking hairdressers. Did it ever occur to anyone the surge can be directly attributed to its increasing usability for almost everything? That and the peer 2 peer decentralised banks don't have their hand in your pocket thing?
I will never tire of this video.

To be honest, something tells me that 10k is barely the beginning. Buckle up folks, this is going to be one wild ride. 
What is a bubble?
"Coming from /r/all this is like some kind of weird cult that spawned from watching too much Jim Cramer while on LSD. 

Enjoy the milestone but remember that what goes up.... if you stand to make a substantial amount of money consider slowly divesting. "
"I remember that $30 Bitcoin bubble, when I spent 2 BTC on Witcher 2. It's a good game. No regrets.

What a day!"
We were here to witness history guys

"May be stupid question but.
How you can buy bitcoin? "
"Legit question, not hating (even though I seriously don’t understand the underlying value) - if I had the equivalent of a million dollars in Bitcoin right now, could I go cash it all out and buy a few exotic cars ?
Is there that kind of liquidity ?

I just keep seeing all these posts about everyone getting rich in bitcoin, but I am not seeing any of you popping champagne on your new yacht. What’s up with that ? "
"apology for poor english

Am I the only one mildly sad because none of my friends bought any bitcoin when I kept telling them about it a few months ago? We could have traveled together if only they bought even just a small amount. 
Are any of y'all actually spending BTC on, like... the exchange of goods and services? 
I just checked my old Coinbase account and forgot just how much I bought in January of 2016! I’m looking at $3,200!!!!!!

"I contemplated buying some back in Dec 2012 when it was around 13.00 USD. I was doing a research project on the deep web and cryptocurrency but I didn’t understand anything. Was so close to dropping a few grand.

"I'll never forget when I saw a reddit post from this sub celebrating breaking $250 for the first time. I tried to figure out how to start but gave up after a few minutes. Never gunna forgive myself for that, but at least I finally learned some shit and invested a few weeks ago at 5000.  

edit: To all the people DMing me and what not to learn about Bitcoin, I appreciate it but I don't have time to respond to everyone! 

The easiest way for you to get some bitcoin for yourself is simply to download the app 'Coinbase' and you literally just buy as much as you want on your debit card. That's not the ideal way to purchase bitcoin, all you really need to do is read this website. 

https://howtobuybitcoin.io/

If you want to know the tech behind it, that'll take more reading and it'll never really make complete sense to you lol.

edit 2: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6a04mc/why_have_i_been_trading_on_coinbase_vs_gdax/

edit 3: 

Let's say you wanted to buy and store a bitcoin - before I go on, it's important to stress **YOU CAN BUY FRACTIONS OF A BITCOIN**, it doesn't have to be a full 10k to start - your first step would be to setup a wallet. Search this subreddit to read their recommendations, there's even a [link](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Storing_bitcoins) on the sidebar for it. I personally use Electrum. If you google it, you'll probably be able to set it up pretty easily. From there, you'll have a bitcoin adress. It'll look something like this: 

1BAmLFekj8P6cM7nyYkb4sqFqsTdKo2Wk1 (one of mine)

With that adress, if you purchase any amount of BTC on a site like Coinbase(see above and use GDAX) you can then send your BTC to the adress that you'll see in your wallet to keep it safe. "
TIL that I should have bought some of them bitcoiner thingys
We back again, /r/all!
We need to throw a party like these guys now that we've reached the first of many moons. BTC PARTY ON REDDIT!!! 
"I actually bought in at 100. 

That first 20 dollars is now 200, somewhere in my wallet.

I bought in when Bitcoin was 4k but I'm still down money cuz I put a lot in alt coins. Don't make my mistake noobs, always hold at least some of your portfolio in Bitcoin.

"God I'm fucking depressed. Friend who knew about this told me about this cool new thing called bitcoin in 2010. I was practically computer illiterate at the time. Then in 2013 it got to $1000 and I though, ""it's definitely going to go up you should get some bitcoins now"" and I didn't.

Congratulations to everyone who played the game. 1 fucking bitcoin could pay for the rest of my bachelors.   I can't even imagine if I'd even gone even $10 into bitcoin 7 and a half years ago. "

guys lets make this #1. I like my 4000k now. 
"Two years ago on Christmas I got my family bitcoin wallets with 50 dollars a piece. They were all pretty disappointed, and asked wtf they would even do with that.. I said spend it, or save it -
 cause you never know, could be worth 10k one day!

They all ended up not using it.. and lost the paper wallets.. Now all of em have been saying they hope to find that paper wallet one day. 

We all used to be considered crazy for investing and utilizing these cryptocurrencies... No one gave a shit about this a few years ago besides us computer people. Look at us now! People are actually excited about Bitcoin, and are happy to talk about it - what a day to be alive!"
THIS IS GENTLEMEN!!!!!!!!!!!
"If you are new to Bitcoin, remember that:

1) You didn't miss the boat. Bitcoin is still in its early phases and it hasn't yet even come close to reaching mass adoption or institutional investment.

2) Bitcoin is highly divisible. The price is never ""too high"" to invest your first $50 into it - a 200% increase is still 200%, no matter how much of a Bitcoin you've bought, and it is predicted to keep going.

3) The best time to invest in Bitcoin was 7 years ago. The second best time is NOW.

There were people kicking themselves at $1000 that they missed the boat. These same people will be kicking themselves at $100,000.

edit: [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/new_to_bitcoin) is probably your best bet for buying your first BTC, but DYOR (do your own research)"
Im so fucking salty rn...
"Eric, I wish I had listened and bought BTC at $2 like you suggested.

... At least I finally got in at $7500..."
Testicle, it's what's for dinner.

"YOU DONT NEED TO BUY A WHOLE BITCOIN. YOU CAN BUY $10 IF THATS ALL YOU CAN AFFORD. THIS IS THE GROUND FLOOR.

Or am I kind of screwed on this? "
