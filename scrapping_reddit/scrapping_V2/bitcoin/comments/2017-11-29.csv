"For all I know it's got to have been at some point between May 22nd 2010, when the [2 pizzas were sold for 10k BTC](https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-pizza-day-celebrating-pizza-bought-10000-btc/) (so 1 BTC = ~$0.0025) and July 17 2010, when the first exchange price was recorded at 1 BTC = $0.04951.

I guess the exact moment when it hit $0.01 can not be determined.

EDIT: Turns out the date could be determined after all. Chart updated."

"Does it mean this is a bubble ? Is it still time to buy ? Do you have good stuff to read for a noob to learn more ? So many questions !

Is it still the beginning since it’s not well known by the general public ? What do you guys expect end 2018 ? 10,5 K ? 20K ? 50 k ?

That's kind of what's got me wondering. A few years ago everyone was talking like you're going to be paying for coffee and socks with bitcoin. A few years on... massive speculation bubble, but I don't seem to be able to buy coffee or socks. 
Well you can sell it for a us dollar

that's rad of you.
Thank you for your service to the community, you will not be forgotten.
To be fair, it was a really good pizza.
"I don't think there was any agreed upon exchange rate for bitcoin at the time; that transaction in part helped to establish its value. Assuming about $25 for the two pizzas, that put their value at the time at $0.0025 per BTC.

*Edit*: For anyone who's curious, [here's the original 10K BTC pizza thread](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=137.0); original post was made on 5/18/2010. A value of about $.003 per BTC at that time lines up with [this screenshot showing some of the earliest bitcoin-USD transactions](https://imgur.com/WX2en1G).

Here's that first pizza transaction: https://blockchain.info/tx/a1075db55d416d3ca199f55b6084e2115b9345e16c5cf302fc80e9d5fbf5d48d"
"[He bought 2 pizzas](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Laszlo_Hanyecz).

>  Can't remember what they were worth then, ...

At the time, 10,000 bitcoins was worth exactly 2 pizzas; it was one of the first (if not _the first_) instance of someone making a purchase for physical goods with bitcoin, ~~so there was no ""market"" to establish any other price.~~

Edit: As /u/lt7991 pointed out, my recollection was wrong. The value at the time was $41, so he overpaid a bit for the pizzas."
They were worth 2 pizzas...
what other real-world use does it need to be worth something other than a store of value? Gold is less fungible easier to create more and easier to forge yet bitcoin is still only 1/50th the value of gold which gets its value from nothing more than speculation and consensus. 
Yep, the primary use of bitcoin for probably 99.5% of people who own any right now is to generate wealth quickly out of thin air. In order for it to ever work as a currency as it was originally intended, it needs some measure of stability.
all according to plan, to make a non-government backed currency you must first get it into peoples hands.

"The fact that people do use bitcoin to pay for things disproves this.  Though it should be obvious anyway.  I still buy computer hardware even though I know the same hardware will be cheaper next year, because I want new computer hardware this year.

It may keep people from spending it too frivolously, at least until the market is saturated, but people will still spend money even if it only ever increases in value, because what's the point in having it if you don't ever spend it?"
Would the divisiblity of bitcoins down to 0.000000000000000001 Satoshis help prevent that?

There are words of wisdom inspired by the folly of those who chased the gold rush. I'm not sure many here have heard them, though. In any case everyone's excited and I don't understand any of what's happening but I hope you all stay happy for a long, long time.
Preach
Been holding since 2013. I bought when it was $250. I saw it go up to $1200 and then drop like crazy and stayed that way for years. I didn't sell though and that paid off. I'm probably going to hodl bitcoin and my other crytos forever. Hopefully, I can pay for things directly with my cryptos in the future.
Hindsight has the ability to turn reasonable into stupid.
I had almost 70 BTC back when was first gaining popularity. Needless to say, could have retired if I had it now. BAH.

"Its strikingly relevant to the success of bitcoin and the defeat of fiat.  In the song is about prince [Baji Rao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baji_Rao_I#In_popular_culture).  

The [lyrics](http://www.bollynook.com/en/lyrics/17983/malhari/) are pretty analogous, including such hits as:

*Let the drums beat, let the cymbals ring, let the songs of happiness be played.  
*Look how the enemy has been defeated

*This small flame has erupted into a huge fireball

*Everyone here is lost in excitement

*This victory of ours is so colorful and unique (clearly referring to our alt coin brothers #inclusion #hopeitsnottoosoon)"

I'd suggest reading the sidebar. Lots of info to sift through
No youre not. You can buy fractions of a coin. 
No, you're not. That's what i though when i bought at 3500.
That’s what I said at $4000. Ended up putting 1k in anyway and now I’ve got $2500.

Because it's basically the equivalent of a modern day gold rush where if you got in early you made out like a bandit 
"Because some people bought in when it was half the price. Some people bought in when it was 1/10th the price. Some people have stashes of coins in the hundreds from 7 years ago and are now millionaires. 
And some people bought in yesterday. 

Regardless - its an exciting and fascinating thing to be a part of whether youre only just discovering it and learning or youve just become a millionaire and can retire at 25. 

Its one of those things that wont be going away anytime soon. "
"Tonight, write a price on paper.  (20,000, 50,000 etc whatever you need it to be)  
This is the price you sell at and completely get out of bitcoin forever.  
  
Otherwise without a clear exit-price you'll hold onto it too long, and be caught in the crash.  "
"You’re not making a killing until you sell for dollars. You and everyone else just want to hold it until you decide to cash out and convert to dollars and buy something useful. The current price isn’t driven by its value as an exchange currency it’s driven by speculation. What happens when everyone starts to cash out at once because they think the price peaked.

When you can pay for a kid’s college tuition in bitcoin I’ll be interested. When you can buy and house or a car I’ll be interested."
Open a free account on Coinbase, make your first purchase. It's super easy. When you have $500 worth of BTC, install a wallet like Bread or Mycelium on your phone, write down the recovery seed (12 words that let you recover your bitcoins if your phone gets stolen or explodes) and transfer your bitcoins from Coinbase to your wallet so that you control them. Everything is super easy.
Gave my parents .2 bitcoin and my brother .1 bitcoin for Christmas when price was $600 per coin. The $120 for my parents is now $2k, and my bro is sitting on 1k
"My friends have been listening to me yell about cryptocurrency since 2014 and almost no one I know owns any.

"Yes. Bitcoin is a terrible currency right now and the price and growth rate doesn't reflect its extremely limited real-world usage.

The skyrocketing price is based entirely on speculation as everyone piles in with the dream of doubling their money in a week, not off the actual growth of it as a useful asset."

In the time it took me to type this, they are already trading at 11.4. Madness.

I bought at 9.9 and I feel like big dick johnson with the big dick!

I was expecting a huge sell off the second it hit 10k. So that'd be me... whoopsie 😎
I threw an extra few bucks in at 9900.   My average buy is at 7000 though.
I bought in at 5k, but bought more at 9.9 to help push above 10k for funzies :)

(a very very small amount, but it was fun to help push)"

Gives his nut to charity?
He's going nuts.
"One of my coworkers was telling me he's going to invest in bitcoin, because it's going up so high. It suddenly struck me that a couple years ago, I bought like $50 worth (.137 BTC to be exact), and then spent most of it, and still had some change leftover and forgot about it.

Well.. I decided to search through my gmail for ""wallet"" until I found my stashed coins, and it turns out my 0.035BTC grew from $10 to $360!

Nice surprise."
"lol, that makes me feel better about my disposable income.  I was thinking ""damn, I would love to have $5k to buy 2 btc a few weeks ago.""

As it stands, I'd get a fraction of a fraction, small enough where these jumps wouldn't amount to much profit for me. "
Me too.  That's quite a bit.
Well now I know my local demo...
I think also at $1k when it made the news, a lot of people who had bought cheap bitcoin but forgot about had a wake up call and went ahead and sold. I can’t imagine too many people holding old coins don’t know about the price now. 
So can I buy like $10 of BC and just let it sit for a decade?
people have been toaking out loans for this shit, unreal.
Yeah during the last few days I've been stuck between buying more or waiting for a bigger dip. Doesn't look like that dip is coming anytime soon. 
lmao okay short story. It’s a drink brand and a few years back issued a recall and said if you bought some at this time you qualify for a refund. I lied about buying it and they sent me a check for $5 so I had the site bookmarked

Some guy, dunno
He didn't get the pizza directly from Domino's, he paid some guy on reddit to send him the pizzas. No clue whether he still has the BTC.
I'd probably have to pay a grocery store in Kansas a lot more than what I'm buying's worth if I wanted them to accept Canadian money for it <.<
Hey pizza is pizza.
I think the guy was just excited his magical internet money could actually get him pizza.
"What is it that you people don't understand about the fact that, this speculative behavior is not only inevitable and unavoidable...but actually serves a purpose?

There is no other way for price discovery of a market-based proto-money to occur; there is no other way to distribute the token and overcome the coordination problems inherent in trying to get people to hold and use a money, which is not yet money until a lot of people hold and use it.

The speculation *has* to happen this way; its not a function of bitcoin's protocol or of the immaturity of bitcoin users. The developers didn't just forget to program stability in, you know? Its a function of economics.

The value of money is in its utility as a medium of *indirect exchange*...in other words, the value is in having a share of a vast network of trading partners. Money doesn't need to be edible or useful in industry or good for making fire...it just needs to be a token held by a lot of people, and be scarce, fungible, homogenous, verifiable, transportable, and durable; then it naturally becomes a valuable network good; a medium of indirect exchange, store of value, and unit of account.

The volatility is slowly-but-surely decreasing as the market cap and liquidity and range of uses increase.  It will continue to do this in an ugly, non-linear fashion, where bubbles and busts continue, as they have been, to be the number one force which broadens the user-base. 

While you all have just come in to this phenomenon in the last few months, and you come to impart your cynical wisdom to us *hapless* bitcoiners who just don't understand that this is all going to come crashing down...the rest of us have been here, buying and holding through 4 or 5 or 6 such cycles, exactly as is happening now (only this one is less volatile in terms of percentages than previous ones)...and we gleefully await picking up more cheap coins again, when this next correction comes.

You will not hear of us again for several years...all the while, smugly assuming you were right, and [bitcoin has died](https://99bitcoins.com/obituary-stats/). Then, out of the blue, bitcoin will be resurging to prices an order of magnitude higher than now.  

I cannot tell you how many times I've had people who were hyper-skeptical about bitcoin come back to me later and tell me how wrong they were."
The drops happen with Bitcoin already. It has always recovered.
There has been numerous -50%/-60%/-70% price drops in the last 7 years. Bitcoin always recovered even stronger.
Remember when people said this at $7?
Yup, ready and waiting
"This might sound like a stupid comment (and maybe it is), but this will actually be an issue when it comes to pricing, which has a huge affect on real-world transactions. People need to really understand just how much money they are actually spending on something, which can be difficult because of the volatility of Bitcoin right now. 

The nearest parallel I can think of is when the UK moved to decimal currency back in the 70s, or maybe the intro of the Euro. 

Made up numbers because example: If I'm buying a can of Coke for a buck, that's, what, 100,000 satoshi? But next week a buck might be 50,000 satoshi, or 300,000. Does the store need to change all it's signage to keep up? Did the Coke go up or down in price? This kind of stuff is pretty confusing for the average person, so Bitcoin remains slightly limited for the moment. I think this will change as time goes on, but right now, it means a lot of the interest is in investment, not in actually using, which is a worry. "
"To be fair, I spend my coins freely. I consider their appreciation as ""free money"" when it comes time to make transactions happen. I bought 2 Ledger Nanos for what essentially cost me less than 1. "
"In his post he said ""left ball"", so plenty of options. I'd eat a meatball right about now"
"So do you. We all know...
For real though, I support that the guy gives to charity. "
Correct, I don't believe charities accept balls as donations.
Very few do though, you would be in the minority - even if you weren't we'd be pretty screwed because no way can the network handle all the new people piling in and actually using it on any regular basis. Mem pool would be backed right up real quickly until scaling solutions are in place and work. I kept my net worth in since 2011 and I bought a trezor, Nano S , VPN subscription, 2-3 amazon gift cards and some shit from the onions. It's free money now but when the market eventually turns bearish(because every market eventually will and at the moment a lot of this growth is driven by speculation rather than actual use case it will when the returns start diminishing for those investors) it's no fun watching your potential profits go down as quickly as they went up.
Hey, don't get testi.
Right there with you bud. Just waiting on the weak minded to relinquish their shares.
And as we all know, past performance is a perfect indicator of future performance, that’s why I’m holding on to this mountain of tulip bulbs. 
So how would you describe your acquisition habits today? Are you still as creative/do you go out of your way to make small amounts of money? Genuinely curious as 14 y/o me would never do such a thing out of sheer laziness. 
Yeah I can't math. $200,000 ≠ $2,000,000
I like that one part where you made it rhyme 
"Not over the course of 6 years though, there have been multiple bear and bull markets in that time. It will cycle, always has this run has been going on for like 2 years now but no one knows where on when it will stop or where it will come back to. I got my first BTC at $1.50 and held through about 4-5 bubbles where I would see my net worth go from up a hell of a lot and then down a hell of a lot. And when you go from having over 100K to less than 20K in a bear market that's no fun if you actually need to use the capital, even worse when that market last for about 2 years. I've watched it go from about $2 to $32 and back to about $5. and from about $50 to about $1300 and back to $200.

We'll have to wait and see how this plays out but my gut feeling is if too many more people dive in and over-invest then when the market does start to turn and doesn't recover you'll see massive increases in the mem pool (because scaling simply hasn't kept up with the increase in users, yet at least) where people are trying to cash out and when that happens, and their transactions take an extended period, then a lot of people will end up crying to regulators which could cause a cascading sell off.

I've always thought that the best way to attack this system would be get people to want the governments to take action."
"Perhaps I'm confused, but I meant $10US, whatever that is in BC. OF course the Wallet too I suppose.

I mean, a toss of a $10 die roll at least isn't any loss, really, if it all busts."
China's been trying out different forms of regulation for years, though. Not saying they'll never outright kill it but at this point it's less a possibility than ever before.

keep in mind you are getting an extremely biased view from this subreddit. spending 80k+ on a currency that is likely approaching a bubble pop is not the smartest idea
"Sure, though I'd probably invest a little more than that.

If you invest $10 and bitcoin is worth $100k in ten years, you'll make $90. If you want to fuck around with $10 you may as well go buy some cheap Cryptos and hope they double in a month or so."
Yeah, I'm not going full retard. But I might risk part of my emergency fund.
buy at small increments over the next few weeks so you can cost average.
Ride the wave until it crashes.
I've been waiting for that dip since 6k. The dip that never comes. 
Hard to say. It was at 5K just a couple weeks ago! It will get a lot of mainstream attention now which will increase demand, but it may prompt China or other nations to ban or regulate crypto. China's regulations have heavily influenced dips in the past.
You really went the extra mile for $5

It happened [on bitcointalk.org](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=137.msg1141#msg1141). (Edit: or [maybe IRC](http://bitcoinwhoswho.com/index/jercosinterview).)

> No clue whether he still has the BTC.

""Q. What do you primarily use bitcoins for? Do you still control millions of dollars worth?

A. Bitcoin as a currency is meant to be spent. Those 10,000 BTC made it back into the economy fairly quickly, around the time they were worth some $400. A ~10x ROI from simply trading in a different currency is quite good, even if that factor could have been higher had I held on to said currency longer. Naturally there will always be people hoarding coins, trying to get rich, and quite a few people did get quite rich, but they wouldn't have got that way without economic growth allowing it. To that extent my bitcoin holdings do usually measure in hundreds or thousands of USD, simply because I use them much as I would a checking account, to conduct business both online and offline when I have the opportunity. Notably the ""humble bundles"" and the attached store accepting bitcoins significantly bolstered my video game library.""

"Yea, I had 10 BTC from wayback in MtGox that ""vanished"" so my bad for leaving them in the exchange and not putting them on a local wallet or something, but it sure has jaded me in general thanks to the current values..."
*tries to pretend not to notice*
*bobs head*
Lmao
lol
It was a blatant conservative estimate
haha
Don’t know why you have to knock personal finance. It offers sound advice. Sound advice does not include speculating on emerging cryptocurrencies. You can appreciate both bitcoin and sound financial advice from personal finance subreddit. We are not a monolith.

bitcoins main worth is generatin discussions on hodlin
"Buying lambos

Edit: it ain’t a Lambo but gold is good enough. "
I gave away .5 btc once. Don't regret it. Those were fun times.
That sucks, but without the early adopters who were trading bitcoin instead of just hoarding it, it would have never been worth nearly as much as it is now.

Also, those pizzas were probably the most expensive pizzas in history. I hope they tasted good.

He created value! Now look where we are! 
"> the two coins I bought

I'm just imagining everybody new to crypto going to whatever platform to buy and entering in a '1' and staring at it and being like ""well, it's this or nothing - sure is expensive but it's not like I can buy a fraction of it."" "
Yasssss! Thank you! I watched that first 20 seconds like 6 times in a row
Thanks..
Is the movie as good as this one scene suggests?
Yeah I went to a movie in my neighborhood Theatre called Delhi belly and it was rated at 100% tomatoes... The crowd was full of native Indian people... The place went crazy and I had no clue what the fuk what's going on.
^ this guy want to see a nut being eaten 
Playing Eve Online is way more effort!
Unless he donates his left nut to charity.
Divisibility doesn't really help the deflation issue, it's that people don't want to spend their coins because the value keeps increasing.
Haha. Mind blown when they realize it goes to eight decimal places.
haha I worded that wrong, I meant the two different coins I bought, XLM and BTC. God I wish I had enough money for 2 BTC lol.
God. This is the reason i *love* reddit and its comments. Thank you for this
If you're into historical epics then yeah. I loved the movie
"Delhi Belly had a very specific north Indian based humour. It doesn't translate well for any outsiders watching it.

I love that movie, BTW. It's a cult favourite here."
"Could happen. I think there is a huge difference between 1k and now though.

2017 has been the breakout year for crypto. Back at 1k, people sold because they couldn't believe their coin that had been dormant for years was finally worth something.

Here, bitcoin is now a steam engine at full speed. People see it is worth what it is valued at, and the actual value is unknown. That's what people will pay almost anything to acquire and few will be willing to give up."
Oh same here!  Even if it hits 7k i'll be going in.
If it corrected that hard I would seriously consider buying more than I could safely afford to lose.
Yes a dip would be the best thing that could happen in the next week
Yeah but GDAX is the highest volume for BTC/RedditGold so...

When everyone is buying, price goes up. When everyone dumping it, price goes down."

At a very simple supply and demand level, yes. The more people who want something, the more you can sell it for. "
I cannot speak to the first question but to the second question absolutely yes. 
RemindMe! 10000 years
Who won't be forgotten?
does the pizza place still have those 10,000 BTC? Because I will sell them some pizza ingredients for 2,500 BTC so they can make 4 Pizzas next time
"Honestly the pizza guy probably thought 10,000 bitcoins was worth way less than 2 pizzas, but figured ""hey, why the fuck not?"" "
Wtf he paid the equivalent of $41 for two Domino's pizzas, it was a shit deal even then. 
Lol
Funny, and true! 
No it's not. Speculators will drop it as soon as they think it's a good idea, or a bad idea to keep it. So a drop will most likely be huge.
"Maybe way down the line, once fees are creeping up because 1 satoshi is worth a bit more.  Its a good thing to have a variety of sat/b transactions, you don't want the lowest 80% priority transactions to be all using 1 sat/byte.  Having a few choices your delivery rate is a feature.  



"
One Satoshi is a unit of measure, it is currently the smallest unit of measure available in bitcoin. Additional decimal places may be added in the future to create greater divisibility, but as it stands there are 8 decimal places in bitcoin. Each full bitcoin contains 100,000,000 Satoshi. The smallest amount that can be expressed in real bitcoin is currently 0.00000001, or one Satoshi.

"Two years ago on Christmas I got my family bitcoin wallets with 50 dollars a piece. They were all pretty disappointed, and asked wtf they would even do with that.. I said spend it, or save it -
 cause you never know, could be worth 10k one day!

They all ended up not using it.. and lost the paper wallets.. Now all of em have been saying they hope to find that paper wallet one day. 

We all used to be considered crazy for investing and utilizing these cryptocurrencies... No one gave a shit about this a few years ago besides us computer people. Look at us now! People are actually excited about Bitcoin, and are happy to talk about it - what a day to be alive!"
Am I the only one mildly sad because none of my friends bought any bitcoin when I kept telling them about it a few months ago? We could have traveled together if only they bought even just a small amount.

"God I'm fucking depressed. Friend who knew about this told me about this cool new thing called bitcoin in 2010. I was practically computer illiterate at the time. Then in 2013 it got to $1000 and I though, ""it's definitely going to go up you should get some bitcoins now"" and I didn't.

Congratulations to everyone who played the game. 1 fucking bitcoin could pay for the rest of my bachelors.   I can't even imagine if I'd even gone even $10 into bitcoin 7 and a half years ago. "

okay guys.. lets not get to the front page... KEEP IT LOW KEY SO I CAN ACCUMULATE MORE

If I️ buy in tomorrow it’s guaranteed to hit rock bottom for sure. Decisions decisions. Congrats to everyone that played the system and earned a nice hefty profit tho
"I woke up about 4 hours ago at 2am and it still hadn't crossed 10k. Then fell asleep only an hour later still didn't cross.

Woke up 10 mins ago (6am UAE time) and I missed the historic moment :("
What a time to be alive!
Lol, this is the gif that hit the front page a few months ago that got me interested in crypto.
This was the gif that finally made me put some money into bitcoin back in October. Hope to continue this incredible journey to the moon!!!
"Kinda feel like every 3 years someone says to me ""Bitcoin is now worth xxx amount, three years ago it was only xx."" And I go, hmm would have been nice to invest in it three years ago. Chalk up another one"
"I've been holding off on investing but fuck it, nows the time.

Just converted $500 USD into bit, match me bitches."
I just told my husband about this and he looked at me with a look of horror. Apparently a poker website he used to play on would pay out in bitcoin but he always would just cash it out because he never thought it would catch on. Cheers to all y’all that rode it out!
I don't have any Bitcoins but I'll always upvote this gif!
PSA: If you end up buying bitcoin, transfer to secure wallet. It’s best to pick one from this official bitcoin website: [https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet). 
Where's the dude that bet one of his nuts saying bitcoins wouldn't reach %10,000?
guys lets make this #1. I like my 4000k now.

"I evidently have 2btc from a cryptovirus coverage account that is not being used. 

Sounds like it's time for a withdrawl. "
THIS IS GENTLEMEN!!!!!!!!!!!
Can we trademark that dance, as the official dance of Bitcoin?
"If you are new to Bitcoin, remember that:

1) You didn't miss the boat. Bitcoin is still in its early phases and it hasn't yet even come close to reaching mass adoption or institutional investment.

2) Bitcoin is highly divisible. The price is never ""too high"" to invest your first $50 into it - a 200% increase is still 200%, no matter how much of a Bitcoin you've bought, and it is predicted to keep going.

3) The best time to invest in Bitcoin was 7 years ago. The second best time is NOW.

There were people kicking themselves at $1000 that they missed the boat. These same people will be kicking themselves at $100,000.

edit: [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/new_to_bitcoin) is probably your best bet for buying your first BTC, but DYOR (do your own research)"

I do not deserve this roi."
We need to throw a party like these guys now that we've reached the first of many moons. BTC PARTY ON REDDIT!!! 
We back again, /r/all!
TIL that I should have bought some of them bitcoiner thingys
"I'll never forget when I saw a reddit post from this sub celebrating breaking $250 for the first time. I tried to figure out how to start but gave up after a few minutes. Never gunna forgive myself for that, but at least I finally learned some shit and invested a few weeks ago at 5000.  

edit: To all the people DMing me and what not to learn about Bitcoin, I appreciate it but I don't have time to respond to everyone! 

The easiest way for you to get some bitcoin for yourself is simply to download the app 'Coinbase' and you literally just buy as much as you want on your debit card. That's not the ideal way to purchase bitcoin, all you really need to do is read this website. 

https://howtobuybitcoin.io/

If you want to know the tech behind it, that'll take more reading and it'll never really make complete sense to you lol.

edit 2: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6a04mc/why_have_i_been_trading_on_coinbase_vs_gdax/

edit 3: 

Let's say you wanted to buy and store a bitcoin - before I go on, it's important to stress **YOU CAN BUY FRACTIONS OF A BITCOIN**, it doesn't have to be a full 10k to start - your first step would be to setup a wallet. Search this subreddit to read their recommendations, there's even a [link](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Storing_bitcoins) on the sidebar for it. I personally use Electrum. If you google it, you'll probably be able to set it up pretty easily. From there, you'll have a bitcoin adress. It'll look something like this: 

1BAmLFekj8P6cM7nyYkb4sqFqsTdKo2Wk1 (one of mine)

With that adress, if you purchase any amount of BTC on a site like Coinbase(see above and use GDAX) you can then send your BTC to the adress that you'll see in your wallet to keep it safe. "

The best surprise.  Congrats!
I have a bitcoin debit card that lets me spend from my bitcoin balance anywhere in the world. I spent over 100 bitcoins since 2012, so I've done my part. I made my last purchase in 2015 and I've been busy buying here and there ever since.
I mostly own BTC for speculation, but I have actually used it for buying digital services in cases where there was literally no other way to pay for them.
Every Steam purchase I make.
Yeah! I bought a neat laptop. Also some games for my Xbox. Bada boom.
This is always my question, like where are you cashing in this glorious investment now? 
Some people are, some people aren't. I do both, I bought christmas presents with BTC this year, but I also just buy it to speculate/trade/invest in. Also, the darknet uses it for drugs and the online gambling industry is starting to use it for deposits/withdrawals
There are several projects involving second and third layers to make it more viable as a currency, but right now it's somewhat inconvenient, depending on the implementation. Buying a steam game with btc is actually surprisingly easy, but still not as easy as one click with a pre saved card.
"Yah I’m wondering that too. Or are people buying it in speculation?? 

I bought a house for 800k last year and it’s worth 1.1m right now. But I have to sell it to make the 300k. But it’s my home and not my primary investment.

From what I read in this suv, people are acting that it’s like their only investment."

Wow. Just Wow. The haters on here. Even in Australia they are accepting Bitcoin to pay for, rent, fuel, property, food, even fucking hairdressers. Did it ever occur to anyone the surge can be directly attributed to its increasing usability for almost everything? That and the peer 2 peer decentralised banks don't have their hand in your pocket thing?

Bitcoin seems like one of those things future post-apocalypse scholars will put a picture of right next to those giant stone discs Islanders used, in a discussion of why they use bullets as a currency now.

Did it really gain $1000 usd in just a few days? I’ve been thinking about getting in on it for a while and if it’s climbing like this I might need to. 
What’s causing this recent spike?
It is going to just get crazier. Hitting milestones every couple of days now. I don’t think it would be a stretch to predict $20k by the end of this year.

Upward price movement is a combination of new money flowing in and people trading on margin  (Borrowing BTC to buy more, no new money entering the ecosystem with this method.)  Then at a certain point, the new money slows down, people margin trading react by also stopping.  Now that everyone realizes the price is stagnating, they begin to take profits.  People margin trading see the price dropping and they begin to short bitcoin, causing the price to further drop.  The market will fluctuate in between support levels (how low it will go) and resistance levels (how high it can go before peaking.)  Successful traders predict these ranges and try buying and selling in between them.
https://blockchain.info/charts
"The price you put in is the price for a full Bitcoin. Then you also put in the amount you want to buy. The total at the bottom should combine the two figures and give you the price you'd pay.

For example, 0.1 for amount, $9500 for price, which would submit an order for 0.1 btc at $950. Always check the total before submitting. I've accidentally submitted an order for 10x the actual value, but was saved because I had insufficient funds. Really easy to do if you're not paying attention and accidentally throw the decimal in the wrong spot, or add an extra number."
"Price fluctuating as people try and short the market and panic sell as soon as it dips a little bit, look up ""bitcoin explained"" videos on YT for good explanations, don't worry about your money, it will recover within the day, play the long game"
have some patience brah.  It's already back over 10k.  Best advice = forget about it and check back in a year or 2.

so I’m a newbie, actually started today – is this kind of dip normal considering the recent trend (past few weeks or so)?
For 1 Bitcoin, you dip whatever you'd like.
big if true
Isn't this the truth
Seriously wtf. I deposited 1k ob the 21st, they told me 4 days, still don't have access. Kinda pissed.
"Hmmm.. 

1. Schedule a dip 
2. Close down exchanges with errors 
3. Allow big boys to buy at discounts 
4. Reopen exchanges for normies to buy at regular rates"
Coinbase is back at least but btc@9800+
Gdax is Coinbase, isn’t it?
The fee depends on which exchange you use, but yes, if it is credited to your account you can turn around and sell it, no problem. 
Probably because everyone else was too
Haha, me too, my payday is in 5 hours..keep on dipping plz
Buzzfeed at the peak *before* normie usage? Really?
Well according to your chart we are in the bull trap phase it seems.
'Big' dip. It literally retraced just 24 hours of growth.
dont panic till it loses 60% in a day.
Everything is falling anyway right now, we newbies got prepared, did not spend what I was not able to afford to lose, then hodl! Hodl hodl hodl! 
Literally the nost normal thing ever with bitcoin. Chill out,go for a walk, screw the Mrs and have a beer. It will all be back to normal monday bro.
Careful what you wish for
yes
Every North American exchange has some type of small fee associated with every trade, but yes, you could have profited roughly $1500.
Be the change you want to see in the world.
If you can find an exchange that lets you log in. 
Or buy the ATH like I tend to always do. Wahoo
Or dip the tip?
lick the tip
The answer is always yes
If only I could... coinbase making problems ...

but this coinbase thing freaked me out..

Last night right after the dip, i tried to buy and my bank sent me an email telling me they are declining this purchase.. coinbase sent me a ""order canceled"" notice.. I feel like the banks were crashing last night and today coinbase.

"
coinsquare also :(
Yep.
I’m attributing this dip to the Coinbase and Gemini platform being down.  I love these skeptics that are haters. I have to listen to them all day on CNBC
Yep
Bitstamp is down as well ... couldnt even look at the price

Ya it can’t seem to handle the traffic. Earlier today when the price was at 9500 I was going to buy, which Coinbase gave me a price of 10010, so I check to see how much to sell, which coinbase then gave me a price of $8900. Holy volatile, so holding.
This thread is making me feel a lot better lol
I only bought 200$ worth, it's not gonna make or break me. I signed the waiver for the roller coaster just like everyone else!
Basically.  That's why $10k was so hard to crack yesterday.  Lots of people had that set as their target to sell. Now today, more people took some profits, the price dips and some people make the mistake of panicking and selling off too so it dips more.  I'm sure you'll see posts from people in a couple of days regretting that they had to buy back in higher because they panic sold.

g8t thx
Nothing that is provable ... kinda like NSA wiretapping. 
My assumption was that coinbase prices were based on the mid market price on gdax. I'm not really sure, though. I'm just a humble hodl man, myself.
Didn't buzzfeed just let go of 100 employees? Lol. 
I bought a 20th of btc and about 4 ltc. I just hope both of these coin survive togheter and end up being the big expense crypto (bitcoin) and the everydays life crypto (ltc).  In ten years from now I hope to pay everything with crypto.

Exactly.  I mean, it's only been a few days since everyone was losing their shit that we crossed $9000.

A fan of chutney and spinal tap. Good work sir.
I'd recommend that you keep your bitcoins. We have to read so many comments by people who regret converting their bitcoins into other cryptocurrencies only to miss the rally when it happens. I've been buying bitcoins since 2012 and I've yet to spend anything on another cryptocurrency.
Of course you should have sold above 10K and bought it back when was close to 9K. You would have 10% more.
I don't know what this means, but I support it.
Some people will say Bladerunner!
Hahaha I have the same problem/solution 
And tons of people who bought the wrong cryptocurrencies lost a lot and missed multiple bitcoin rallies. Many cryptocurrencies disappeared for every cryptocurrency that was successful. Staying in bitcoin turned out to be a pretty good and safe decision.
I did, I spent more on other investments than I ever spent on bitcoin, although my bitcoins grew to represent a sizable percentage of my investments. Cryptocurrencies are so intertwined, mostly with bitcoin, that I wouldn't call this diversification. I didn't want to make this type of gamble. 
Welcome.
"So, Im new to investing and bitcoin, but from my understanding it would be best to sell when it starts to drop and then buy in when it starts to go up again right?

Unless he is talking about missing the opportunity because you aren't always watching the trades."
This guy gets it
It wasn't provable then it was but now it isn't a problem.
https://i.imgur.com/9cNt55E.jpg
Yup
He/she’s probably doing ok... guessing not too worried if being buying since 2012. !
I mean it makes sense to diversify. 
"I have read about hodling since I bought last week. It was just about to drop below the price I bought in at, I panicked.... Luckily I keep my bitcoin in a wallet outside GDAX, the exchange crashed hard and transaction took forever. By the time my transaction was confirmed the price bounced up again, so I just lost txfees. Stupid, but less stupid than if I sold off my bitcoins.

So thank you whoever spams transactions and thanks Coinbase for crashing and having me rethink my decisions. Next time I'll just HODL."
Every single time, like clockwork. As if people can't read a bit further back and notice a trend.
That's where I have all these fools beat! I don't even know how to buy or sell, so my only choice is to hodl
NSA wiretapping is provable, just nobody that matters thinks it's a problem.
Life imitates art
Well I'd say you missed out a lot by not buying any other crypto...
so great!
don't know about $, in EURO, on coinbase/gdax i see a fee of 1 EUR for every 100 EUR . So if i buy BTC worth 500 EUR, i pay 5 eur.
In the euro wallet, I am fairly certain that you can.
Most professional economists predict rising prices until people just hoard the coins instead of spending them. Then it crashes
Today's movements was just about seeing the guy to cut his right balls as he said he would :)
This is actually healthy for the market, to add on to what others have said. Prevents it from becoming too... bubbly.
"Yeah, some type off pullback was to be expected after going on the ridiculous run we've been on. Just look at it as another chance to buy at a relative discount. There hasn't been any ""bad"" news or anything, just people taking profits, and a natural market correction. "
yes. bitcoin has rocketed the past week. This is completely normal.
it's about market cap. there's only so much money available in the market.
"Alts is where real money is made. It's like the wide west of crypto. And then you have cryptopia/yobit which are the final frontier.

Edit: Never hit the final frontier. Ever."
Those of us who have been here for a while have seen the price drop by 50-75%, a bunch of times.

What kind of fees do they take for buying/selling? 
but can I just leave my USD/EURO there without withdrawing ?
SKULLS FOR THE SKULL THRONE
You only lose when you sell. 
It'll go up beyond 11k eventually.. might take a week or two or a month but it definitely will at some point
"""crash"" course, ha, i see what you did there"
I am in the same boat, I have $250 set aside to buy some bitcoin, just trying to time it out so I can get it under $10k if possible. If I lose everything I am fine, if I start making money I might invest more. 
Makes more sense to think of it as a correction not a dip. It inflated in price a huge percentage over a very short time so that was never going to be sustainable. The result is that it crashes back down and settles an a more stable value. 
I get to screw your missus and get a beer? 
Buy a ticket, take the ride
Should have done it 4 hours ago. Was $9500
echo chambers do that.
You'll regret having said that
The answer is always yes
Try using a credit card, goes instantly for me
Is this a thing?
Bigger dips are normal, this has only gone down to the level of 24 hours ago after record levels of growth over several days.
Yeah - I think I’m going to just add to the position. Someone brought up a good point about the Far East waking up - hopefully not to panic, and adding to their positions.  
Indeed. I somehow had my order go through but couldn't access the site to move my limit order down to catch the sub 9000 dip
Fr. 36 hours isn't a dip
Buzzfeed is pretty much the normie gateway. Once they put it out in public, it's 'over' and then in a few months it'll show up used incorrectly in /r/FellowKids

Congrats on your baptism by fire."
I think you mean up to 20k on Monday. This train has no brakes.

Have fun with the taxes!
Protip: ring your bitcoins up as bananas. They're cheaper that way.
Looks like memes are back on the menu boys!
Why is my money is *always* pending when the dips happen?!
BTC is having a slight feeling for where the floor is. A drop is quite a strong word for what is currently going on.
HAHAHAHAHA.
at one point it dipped to 8900 and i wanted to buy but coinbase is gay and i already spent my 250$ limit
The memeblocks are full because of someones shitposting mastery, weak hands are shook AF as connor mcgregor BUYS THE DIP
[removed]
I was actually kinda disappointed when Vegeta memeing hour arrived. Years to prepare and there were only two good ones
Goku is about to use the kaioken attack.. watch out.
or coinbase being down...
Theory checks out 
lol WEAK HANDS SHOOK AS F
Wish I could buy the dip but I'm out of funds! lmao
"""correction"" because gdax is unaccesable? 

(if you are logged in, stay in. If not, you might be unable to log in)"
Glad I joined at 8900 to be part of this shitpost community.. 
how bout we combine the vegeta meme with a picture of andre 3000?? that'll bring us to 12000 and should last us for a while
Cool. I bought at 9800 and 10 seconds later it drops to 9500. Such is the way.
lmao what a thing to be a part of
how low will it go so we can buy more?
"Not a dip, its already back to where it was TWO DAYS ago!

Wake me when something more interesting happens ;-)

Are we going to have to the the whole 10k thing again?



"
There are probably plenty of quality ones that were missed due to the overall hype build up on the top 3-4 ones. Let's give them a chance again. Plus I need to buy more.
Idk man I tried ... https://i.imgur.com/rd0bK36.jpg

Can someone please explain bitcoin to me? As base as possible. and also bitconnect. I know about bit coin. I was foolish enough to come in when it was at 9,400 and im losing money of course, im just trying to understand. someone please.
[deleted]
We need a list of meme-able numbers now.
Does anyone have the number of daily-worldwide-transactions using bitcoin and the source of the data?
"You’ve won my Internet today.

Thank you for a belly laugh."
best thread ever. need to see more Vegeta memes though
I was hoping it'd drop to 5k :(
cheap coins incoming :D

I can't take this volatility, moving all my btc into Tulips.
Where do I invest into the 10k meme econo...is there an address to send my dogecoins to?
/r/MemeEconomy is leaking... And I'm OK with that.
what's your exit strategy for bitcoin??? it's as if nobody here actually gives a shit about **using** bitcoin as a currency and just wanna get rich quick (but get rich in fiat)?
1337?
HahahahHAHAHAHAHahahahaHAHAHHAaA
Trying to buy but everything is fucking down aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
"Hahahahah

Classic post - Have an upvote."
So the value of Bitcoin is dependant in the quantity of Meta?
Hurry everybody start making the 15k memes 
I’m just glad I had the opportunity to buy Bitcoin one last time for less than $10K. 
"CIA Superior: What do we learn, Palmer?

Chad Feldheimer: I dont know sir.

CIA Superior: I don't fucking know either.

Chad Feldheimer: I guess we learned, not to do it again.

Chad Feldheimer: Yes sir.

Chad Feldheimer: I'm fucked if I know what we did."
tbh the 10k memes were pretty bad/non-existent.
**Memeing intensifies**
I know its abit off topic but where can I sell my bitcoins store the USD/EURO on the site and rebuy later.
Meme harder or we're gonna lose it!
"tried to buy at 92 but coinbase is having a shitfit. in a few days i will be eithet quite mad or quite happy.

Just a small buy so no big deal."
"This dip was predictable. It hovers at 9.8k for days with resistence and as soon as it crosses the 10k line it goes mental to 11k due to the mass fear of missing out by the weak hands. Then it continues to rise a bit before dipping back down to around 10.5k where it should be once people come to their senses.

I made quite a nice little bit of pocket change from this.

All you had to do was view a few exchanges to see a HUGE shear rise in buy orders at exactly 10k... was predictable.


Now people are panic selling due to same ignornace and makijg it worse."

The bubble has been called off back to Hodl

Lawyer: ""He bought and meme'd your Honour, HE BOUGHT AND MEME'D!"""
"Many people were ready with 9k memes, some people were even ready with 10k memes. 

Nobody was ready with 11k memes"
"As well as GDAX.

EDIT: Off and on."
What causes these kind of massive fluctuation 
"You know what this means, right? 

There will be 40K memes galore, and will be the next support line once reached. "
Looking forward to the Warhammer 40k memes!
"Sorry if this is a stupid question, but I saw it dipped to $9k, so if I bought 1 BTC at $9k, then it jumps back to $10.5k, is that $1500 profit, or what kind of fees are involved? Can you buy in the morning, sell at lunch time? 

"
Good thing I had a buy order in at 8600 for a few hundred. Ez fill. 
we gotta take it to 11 boys
"Not once I shift into

***MAXIMUM OVERMEME!!!***"
I was sure I’d see at least one meme with eleven from “Stranger Things”, but nope, none. What a disappointment...
There's a 9/11 joke somewhere
BUT THIS ONE GOES TO 11
Nominal post! Love it!
I forced a buy at $9500, like as in I had to twist the seller's arm. Tells you something.
These are the exact kind of shitposts I look for when the price drops 
Is STILL over 9000!!!
Yeah, life is all about MEME.
buy the dip?!
I said it a few days ago. The economy is fueled by shit posts and dank memes.
No. It was this time of the week where I buy at the ATH. - 18%. Thank me for the dip. 
"Coinbase frozen for anyone here?

Edit: I feel like I’m in line at the supermarket and everyone is trying to purchase some dip, but the automated cashier is down"
Agreed...they really are useful for newbies though to see that everyone's not panicking. Helped me chill tf out during my first big dip.
Legendary post...you've just created meme fib retrace with boll band tech analysis for our new charles swabb investors coming on board today.  Man its going to be boring when bitcoin hits $1,00,000 in a couple years and only moves 1% max a day.
I’ll 2nd that. Especially after reading everyone’s panic posts. 
It is dropping because the big money that keeps the buying selling cycle of inflation/deflation are on the sell cycle, it will stay on this cycle until they decide to pull funds and invest in something else.
HODL YOUR POSITIONS SOLDIERS!
401k memes will be so real
We need some Kaioken x2 memes up in here, get up to 18,000 in no time. 
this is just price meme shitposting but the spirit of 2013 is back in r/bitcoin. Thanks everyone!
i think the best part of this is how much trouble we were having breaking 10k. But now the 10k is like a little hiccup we easily fly over
Memes are actually a pretty accurate way to keep track of current events. Most of the time I don’t know what’s going on until I see several memes and google it.
Diamond tier shitpost
Lmao
Traveleling beyond the speed of memes and breaking several laws of physics, prompting  development of and entire new field of hypermemes to explain this phenomenon.
The next support line is panic sell 5k memes followed by FOMO 9k Vegeta, Then rinse and repeat until all newblood money is absorbed by hodlers
Bitcoin is just hiding it's power level, you can't trust the scouter.

It was freezing on me and giving errors right as I was trying to buy at $9K damnit!
If it lasts 36 hours until payday, thanks.
It's my fault.  I transferred some funds from my investment account over to Bitcoin.  It's kind of like washing your car on a sunny day.  It guarantees a rain storm will follow shortly thereafter.
Thanks for the dip.
It's time for some (24k) gold memes
"Quick, get me a picture of the Nostalgia Critic with a bitcoin slapped over his face and the caption ""Why 11k? Because I like to go one step beyond."" "
"Where are the ""this one goes up to 11"" memes?"
I like eggs
Still happy I bought at 11k lol.

It is still over 9K though.
