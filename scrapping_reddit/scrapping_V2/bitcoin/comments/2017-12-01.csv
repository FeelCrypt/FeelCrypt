"I disagree. If I convert $20 into BTC and then those BTC into drugs I spent $20 on drugs.

A better was to say it is missing out on a huge investment chance. Of course, there are large risks and high probability of selling off early. There are many traditional investments that anyone could have made millions on if they only knew the future."
I can feel you. I did hold every. single. BTC I mined back in 2012 which is really good BUT i did invest 30k into this ICO back in 2014 and turned it into 150k when i sold all of my ETH for $1... SMH... :) Its human nature gentlemen... and ladies...

"We are well past the halfway point for the most generous projection of growth, which would be total financial revolution at 1-4 million USD per coin.

Nobody knows how much farther it'll go, but if it is here to stay, it'll probably double at least a few more times. But for perspective:

For simplicity, let's say initial price was $0.01/BTC (it was originally lower):

100×: $1

100x: $100

100x: $10,000

100x: $1,000,000

In the best-case scenario, growth reached the latter phase at $100. That's around the time that the rags-to-riches opportunity disappeared. But it's still probably possible to make a pretty good return. "

"> No one who invests in bitcoin is smart. There’s not some deep analysis of market forces going on here. People see growth and they chase it.

Some people still remember the bank bailouts and prefer a currency that can't be spun out of thin air at the whim of the Secretary of the Treasury ([at the time, a former CEO of Goldman Sachs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Paulson#Conflict_of_interest_claims)).

But seriously, what's the difference? Coinmarketcap says the name is MIOTA but the symbol is IOTA?? Are they actually the same coin or did they mess up the naming?
"By definition, traditional investing isn't that smart and it's people just chasing growth as they see it. It's the same thing. Investment firms literally tell you that there is a chance you will lose everything, and there's no insurance if that happens. They can't promise any ROI outside of CDs. 

Yes, there is more research that can be done on traditional markets than cryptocurrency, but that's because of crypto's relative immaturity. Most investors in the stock market still get left with their dicks in the hand when shit hits the fan. We're not big players.

Invest what you can afford to lose, and it'll be OK. Bitcoin could make a lot of people financially independent. That's a great thing."
"Right. There are 10 coins on the Top 100 under $0.10 a piece.

37 under $1.

88 under $100.

If you bought one of each of those 88 and any ONE of them hit $10,000, you'd have more than recouped your investment."

"Compared to Bitcoin? Yes. Compared to other investments? 9% is quite good. Dependent on blend risk, a lot of investors would be very happy with a sustained 9% ROI. Give me a 22 year-old who, through their own contributions and company match, is able to put away even $6,000 a year...they'll have nearly $2,000,000 in retirement savings at the age of 60. 

I don't think you know a whole lot about investing...to call 9% ""terrible"" is so incredibly condescending and flat-out wrong. I'll give you a hot-tip...the huge 20% gains that investors are seeing this year does not happen every year. Some years, you lose money!! Maybe even for years at a clip. It's about the long view.

Get some perspective."
Thanks man TIL. 
Holy shit TIL
Yeah but what that means is that huge gains is not a synonym of impending failure, there are some assets/stocks that prevail.
Actually a market capitalisation rush of 1000% beyond an IPO is incredibly rare, and generally points to innovation beyond the norm. It would generally be very difficult to forget, except where the market capitalisation is sub $100M. It's so rare that Google isn't yet trading 1000% above its IPO.

I feel it in my wallet when I buy on the dip.
I'm both of those. I want to make money but also believe in the tech. I'm an ebay seller and if bitcoin could become accepted on there it would have a pretty cool impact. 
That's what happened when the price went from $11,000 to $8,600 in minutes a couple of days ago, but it seems like panic selling at the first sign of your first dip is a rite of passage for greed-flavored newcomers who don't know anything about bitcoin. It just transfers money from the weakest to the strongest hands and teaches them a valuable lesson they won't forget. Not a big deal in my opinion. We warn them again and again not to panic sell, but these people often didn't bother reading anything because they're so afraid of missing out.
No single raindrop believes it is the cause of the flood. 
There are other cryptocurrencies which don't have this limitation. Bitcoin isn't a failure because it doesn't fit every use case.
Good enough! :)

I work in software and have landed all my jobs (mostly at companies you've heard of) from LinkedIn. YMMV.
"Well I get contacted by some recruiters on there many of them don't pan out into actual interviews. I don't have much experience (started working full time only a year ago) so i don't get noticed by too many recruiters. Infact my profile only gained traction after I completed 1 full year of work experience. 

They also offer a premium subscription which I think is kind of a scam because a recruiter can still choose to hide their information when they're viewing your profile. The only thing of value that I gained with linkedin premium is adding in certificates from the courses you can complete there. 

Applying to jobs on there is pointless. I can say that 99% of the jobs I've applied there by myself never pan out and another thing is that most of the job roles posted there force you to again register on another website that the company uses."

Amazon's only had one year where it jumped nearly 1000%, and that was 1998 when it jumped 966%. In 2000 it dropped 80% when the tech bubble popped, and then dropped 30% from *that* level in 2001. It nearly recovered from that, but then the Great Recession hit. It wasn't until 2009 that it finally returned to that same price from 1998 (adjusting for splits).

Basically what I'm doing. One of these couple dozen will become the preeminent commonly used currency. BTC is out to the early lead because its the first and most famous. Just a waiting game right now.
There’s a relationship there. Bitmain only sells antminers with BCH. So whenever they release a batch of S9s, a bunch of people have to buy BCH in order to buy the equipment to mine more BTC. 
Hello I'd like to report a murder
If some of the other shit we see in the alt coins can reach as high as they are then I can see a bright future for litecoin it's one of the only coin's I would consider, that and monero. Bitcoin may make both obsolete with scaling and confidential transactions - that doesn't mean it will die though there's coins out there which are absolute garbage at least ltc kind of acts like a second bitcoin testnet. One of the biggest issues with it is that it's pretty much a given that 70-80% of the coins are in the hands of whales.

Probably will go up in price longer term but I'm not convinced on the tech though. It's interesting but it hasn't really delivered on it's initial promise and it has a lot of technical issues to overcome that I'm not convinced that they can.

There's a lot of loose terminology thrown around in the IOTA crowd. Usually when you hear about buying IOTA they are talking about buying MIOTA since that is the denomination used on exchanges.
That makes a lot of sense.... but why do they have so many coins? It sounds like it would be a bit unwieldy.

"What do you mean? The whole point of bitcoin is to invest in it and get rich. Aside from that, people don't care. Not enough merchants accept Bitcoin, IMO. 

If it became a more widely accepted form of currency in everyone's day to day life, not so prone to fluctuation in price, it would be something. But as it stands, it's a redistribution of wealth with potential to cause catastrophic harm to actual economies; to most people.

If Bitcoin were to be accepted at more retailers, restaurants, etc. it might be super useful. Unfortunately the fluctuations in price don't help this.

Edit: Yes, I'm fully aware that I'm probably going to be downvoted to oblivion for this. Sorry I have an opinion."
Cheers. 
i agree
I'm having terrible understanding what either one is saying
"I've never bother with any alt coin tbh, I did once have a stack of monero but sold those at around $5 to put back into bitcoin right before it decided to suddenly jump in value a lot. I only to take small positions in alts to trade certain  scenarios like a break of an ATH where you can make a few % and walk away. They are way too volatile and you could be waiting a long time for them to come back to their highs if they do drop. Crypto in general is volatile but at least with bitcoin your more than likely to reach the price you paid for it sooner or later. Bitcoin has pretty much doubled in 3 weeks and it has a solid fundamentals for a crypto. I wouldn't like to say buy it up now but who knows how far this run can go or where it will end, the higher the price goes the more people pile in which creates a feedback loop due to the scarce nature.

I would have thought that we need a serious correction before long to keep going up because this sort of growth is a little insane tbh. Just don't put more than you can afford to lose in it because it's already parabolic and there's a lot of fomo which is a little worrying, I would say wait for a dip but your probably better spreading your buys and cost averaging it and buying a little each week/month. I also really wouldn't ask people on reddit what to buy because your going to get biased answers for the coins that people are in but bitcoin will likely be the coin that still stands years from now unless something else comes along which seems unlikely. The best times to buy is when the media isn't talking about it and it's been going down for a while though not 2 years into the most bullish run in history. Sometimes it does just take off and never returns to those levels ever again though. You never know... The one thing you want if faith that the tech is actually good behind the scenes."
"Correct there is no mining, and hence no fees for any transactions. Instead of mining, each node that initiates a transaction must also verify two other transactions in return.

IOTA is not even based on a blockchain, it is based on a directed acyclic graph called the Tangle. It is conceptually similar to a blockchain but instead of growing in only one direction it grows infinitely in all directions. So theoretically the bottleneck that you have with Bitcoin and other blockchain-based currencies (where everyone has to vie for a spot in the new block added to the growing end of the chain) doesn't exist because any transaction can attach to any other transaction anywhere along the chain.

You can see what it looks like in real time at https://tangle.blox.pm/ or at http://live.iotaknot.com/

On the second one you can double-click a dot to see that transaction. Looks like a lot of them are 0 iota transactions right now, probably the result of spamming the Tangle which is done intentionally to speed up the network."
"Yeah, just like Bitcoin there is a predetermined number of coins. They are indivisible. And you can buy a million IOTAs for about 1.30$ now. The huge number of coins is due to the business case of IoT and microtransactions (hence also why every transaction has zero fees), so machines can send very low amounts of money back and forth, for example to buy the data of a sensor.

The number of coins may seem huge, but when one puts it in comparison with Bitcoin, with its smallest division of 1 Satoshi, then IOTA only has something like 1.7 times as many coins."
"Well, not yet! So thanks for catching my mistake on that. ;)

I've got to map out my budget for the next couple months and then gameplan. I'll take this into consideration in my planning."
"Very strange because public record shows Google IPO entry point at $85, and that means they only would have passed $850 this year. 

Regardless, it's not the crux of the point so it's not a hill to die on. The point is that you need pretty fucking startling technological innovation to grow 1000%. "

Well, 80k with the current (I know, not exactly right, but approximately) price of 9k, means he owns 8,88 BTC now. 5000/8,88 = 563.
Yes because it's new, but over the next 50 years it could solve alot of problems, you can't get rich off of something that isn't worth anything in the long run. Once the price settles though fuck knows how high it will be in worth per btc. Like 1 might buy a house.

I imagine that's what happened to a lot of us."
Ah cheers! This question gets asked a lot I imagine, but which coin would you recommend investing in? I'm thinking either monero, lite, BTC, or that Z one (zeeter or something?). There's so many to choose from.
"IOTA is designed for nanotransactions by internet of things devices. Enabling the creation of billions of autonomous economic actors creating their own markets on the fly all the time. Charging for electricity by the second, charging for a self-driving car by the second, etc.

Also it is working on some specialized hardware logic capabilities with chip manufacturers using ternary instead of binary logic because it is far more efficient for hashing. There is no mining in IOTA, each node that initiates a transaction has to verify two others in exchange, so hashing has to be extremely low-power. Using ternary would make that hashing far more efficient. The number of IOTA created is because it is a perfectly round number in ternary. Because so many were created it is bundled into MIOTA, a million IOTA per MIOTA."
Heard theres no mining them, all the coin are already there already out in the system and can be bought during the ICO? Any iota hodler help? Don’t wanna spread false info, or you could just google them. 😬
I agree with your premise. I just wanted to make sure you weren't putting money in based on the price per coin of each crypto.

If not after a correction... eventually it will. Think about it, anyone can buy Bitcoin with a $20 phone, and donut world wide. I understand why people think the marketcap could be $20 trillion.

Get your point, but I think I was misunderstood. If you are investing you want return, I agree. But people who see bitcoin as forex are missing the whole point. Bitcoin is the most incredible socio/economic experiment I had the privilege to watch and is our proof of concept to use blockchain to change the financial system. I don't know if in the future we will see bitcoin as our safebox and move to other alts to run our lives, but right now I think we need to prove this can work to start building a truly new system.

3. Bitcoin has been around for several years and has not been hacked, broken, etc.

My take is that if you are in it for the long haul (3+ years at least), diversify, but go heavy on bitcoin. Ether and Litecoin are the only others I know enough about to say they might be viable. Maybe Iota if it gets traction."

It won't take as long as you think if you know roughly when it was. Odds are you used Reddit less back then as well. You don't need an account for change tip to work I don't believe.
I'm no expert but I think you need to create a wallet/account to be able to receive BTC. 
The question is: are all of these maybes worth 10 grand?
Sorry. I don't know. I suggest Coinbase for newbies because it is so populaer and user friendly, and has a good reputation for safety. But I haven't used it, and I live in a country where it is difficult for me to buy on the big exchanges.

Where are your bitches, Mr. Big-Time Pimp?
What about ethereum? Isn't it the second biggest behind bitcoin?
Can you not sell in smaller amounts?
That inverse relationship only was true for a moment, while Bcash was trying to overturn Bitcoin. Now I expect Bcash will go down like the other alts when Bitcoin goes down.
"Recently they have been rising and falling together actually. 

And diversifying isn't really about if BTC and other coins have similar growth patterns on a daily basis or not, rather it's about hedging your bets for the long term. "
Is there a massive list of all crypto currency, it’s back history, what makes it unique etc?   I saw a sample portfolio and saw someone with like 15 crytocurrencies wtf.  
are you guys talking about Bcash?
"There are so many IOTA that it is denominated in bundles of one million IOTA, hence MIOTA.

It is designed first for nanotransactions by internet of things devices, and as a result also works as a zero-transfer-fee currency for humans as well."
I thought it was cause of the current value, when you buy 1 iota in current trade you’re actually buying 1million iota hence 1mIOTA to avoid confusion or something. Correct me if I’m wrong
"You're comparing apples and oranges. 

You are not factoring in the market cap and the supply of coins. For example, BTC has a supply 16.7 million currently while the #3 crypto Ripple has a supply of over 38 billion, so it is only 25 cents. If the value of Ripple was to equal BTC, it would be worth about $4 a coin.

 "
It's $20,000
I don't get why either, but it's just a slugfest of childish insults. Calling him a troll (literally based on his appearance), criticising  his creations, and attacking his character. It's weird.

Fun fact: Buying Bitcoin is not investing, it's speculating.
When your neighbor asks you for advice about investing in something he knew little about a couple of months ago, that is time to be cautious. My neighbor ask me how to invest in Bitcoin!
Very good point - there is an inverse relationship with Bcash - should've stated.

"I thought it was funny a year ago when people were talking about crypto portfilios and all this crap. Even my take out chef is like ""I've been investing in ICO's"" and I just laugh when he can't explain the difference between investing and speculating."
You can't be an investor without a calculated forecast based on reasonable assumptions. The only way to price bitcoin is to wait for a bigger fool. Thus, it is gambling. Why not be honest about it? Done it myself. 
My grandpa just bought $50 in bitcoin, because he kept hearing about it in the news. My uncle did it for him, but I mean at some point aren't we going to run out of people wanting to invest in bitcoin? After my uncle buys his dog some bitcoins then I think our family is basically tapped out for new investors.

Chaos is a ladder.
But if they panic sell all together, we all feel it. And I think that will be a problem, these new accounts are people o want to make money, not people who believe in the technology. They will panic sell more easily I guess.
nah man we invest in bitcoin too we’re just golden gods and five star men 
They can't help it - Pensions, Endowments, SWFs, etc have to put a portion (even if just a 5% sliver) in cryptos as a hedge against missing the boat, otherwise their returns might be left in the dust - conversely if everything tanks, they only had that miniscule proportion invested.
Here’s my question, how much would someone have to invest for someone to make serious money if bitcoin explodes in value?   Seems like you need a lot of full bitcoins, not fractions which I’m sure more people own.

Yes, this ~~scheme~~ investment only works if there's a constant and increasing flow of people willing to buy
It means they have almost no impact on the price when they panic buy and sell, which is a good thing.
Many of us just might be though. We picture it as a pre-offering before the ICO

finance career btw
As someone that works in traditional finance I can tell you that is starting to change. Digital assets are starting to be talked about. **A lot.**
"To be fair to all ""traditional finance people"" - mind you, I do hold traditional investments and retirement accounts - many of them hold managed mutual funds or tracker funds and have little to no expertise in actual investing outside of ""Wow! This fund has given 9.04% return on investment in the last ten years!"" Like...you picked a winner...congrats. Most people who manage their own portfolio lose money or cannot outperform a fund that tracks market performance. Sound familiar?

That's investing, but it doesn't mean you're smarter than anyone else for holding your wealth in traditional investments. Even someone who invested small amounts in Microsoft or Apple, held all these years, and is now a millionaire isn't necessarily ""smart."" They're smart because their investment paid off in a big way. Luck can make even the biggest moron look intelligent.

Bitcoin will make many of us look like geniuses if it continues to pan out over the next 5-10 years. But I'm still the same dumb person."

Dudes loaded and lives on the internet, what do you expect?
"> Slow bleed leads to currency crisis as the expected value of bitcoins solidifies in people's minds. At first they are conservative, they invest ""what they can afford to lose"". After 12-18 months, their small stash of bitcoins has dramatically increased in value. They see no reason why this long term trend should reverse: the fundamentals have improved and yet adoption remains low. Their confidence increases. They buy more bitcoins. They rationalize: ""well, it's only [1 -5%] of my investments"". They see the price crash a few times, due to bubbles bursting or just garden-variety panic sales – it entices them to buy more, ""a bargain"". Bitcoin grows on the asset side of their balance sheet.

It wasn't always like that. The obsession with memes and shitposts is very recent. They make us look so childish.
"As the value of bitcoin increases, egos increase with it... Some people get cocky because they're making extremely easy money with little to no effort, and they don't know how to handle it.

It's like that annoying friend that may babysit kids without having a child of their own, but they'll take every opportunity to tell others about how difficult it is to raise kids, or what they need to be doing to with their children.

Making easy money on BTC and experiencing financial success doesn't automatically make someone an expert in BTC and cryptocurrencies... but that won't stop those people from thinking they are."
Are you saying that Kennedy cashed out his Hindenberg shares, because he knew that by the time a shoe shine knows that something is a good investment, *everyone* will know too, which will cause giddy excitement among the Hindenberg crew, leading to the crew emboldened to think they could dock in heavy wind, ultimately causing the Hindenberg to crash and the company value to tank?
He said that he's bearish on the short term and very bullish on the long term very recently. It was a reply to someone asking how he felt about bitcoin.
Yeah you maybe right but problem here is bitcoin does not revolves around America only, but the whole world and the country I live in momentum is about to start.

I'm not saying a crash is inevitable either, but the longer it becomes a tool used for speculative trading and isn't used for actually buying things the more it reminds me of Dutch tulips.
