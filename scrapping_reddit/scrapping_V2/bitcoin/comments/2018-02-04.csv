"Brilliant.

Edit: 

Well, as I‚Äôm here I may as well make this comment useful.

‚ÄúThis your last chance. After this there is no turning back. You take the [blue pill](https://www.reddit.com/), the story ends. You wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to. You take the [red pill](https://www.youtube.com/user/aantonop), you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes. Remember, all I'm offering is the truth. Nothing more.‚Äù"
Now if only we had a Gif of a junkie shooting up Gas 50,000 in an ally with Ethereum in the baggie 
Dem hodlers!
I'm surprised to see it was only gilded once.. 
Is Hodlers a meme or misspelt?
It‚Äôs all the hodlers fault, clearly.
Vreddit sucks
Genuinely clapped this, well done sir.
In the time it toke to make that edit it hit 7.5 k than bounced back so funny 
Last 3 years feels a bit different.
Honestly, I know I'm prolly gonna get hate but next time Bitcoin plunges should I buy? 
Exacly :D
FUCKING AMAZING

It's time to die.
Amazing 
All the shitcoins should follow suit 
"/r/all here, did you all _really_ expect anything else?
"
I mean, you're holding onto 1's and 0's supposedly once worth 15k+ a piece... what else did anyone expect?
Very good.
Haha love it!
It seems like all the HQG kids have gotten a hold of Bitcoin.
wtf is a hodler? 
Holy shit, thank you for making me laugh for the first time in a few days.  When the ambulance hit the tree I lost my shit.
"Haha awesome video man.

You missed the end bit. BITCOIN TO THE MOON"
"And people here laughed at me here when I said bitcoin is tulip mania 2.0

Mark my words, bitcoin is gonna crash down to 3k or even lower by mid 2018. But I guess at least the smart people cashed out when it was 15k+, while the idiot hodlers cling to a bubble."
D'oh!
Best thing I've seen this week, thank you
Quality shitpost. 
[deleted]
Wiley e Coyote memes are better.
Beautiful
Are the shitposts back? Does that mean Bitcoin will reach a new ATH??
Hilarious.
This is me but with TRON. I‚Äôm just hoping one day I can cash out during a bull run and buy some McDonalds with my earnings.
They've predicted the future more than once now
[deleted]
The Simpson's predicted bitcoin
7k* haha
"As a PC player, you all might dislike this but I salute the crash.

Maybe I can buy a GPU again and not invest into a entire new system. Looking at you GTX 1080 Ti prices."
"Remember the days when Bitcoin was ""currency"" and not an ""investment?"""
https://ochoochogift.blogspot.com.ng/2018/02/trader-reveals-big-event-this-week-that.html?m=1
D'oh!!!
LmaoüòÇüò≠
Explained clearly...Crystal clear!!
That's really awesome :D
What episode is this from?
but it's still worth 7k. so if you bought it at 1:1 then you have 7 grand now
Does this mean GPUs will finally be buyable for the normal user again ?
"Im sure someone has already asked this, im sorry i cant find that post.
Where/how can i download and share this work of art? Please?"
/u/ashtonxzzx 
Holders... lmao
love it
Creative 
On point
how funny, but interesting
Lmao Hahaha so true. 
Unfortunately that is me too
"Remember Bitcoin? It‚Äôs back! In POG form!

"
Awesome!
"Hodlers?
"
LOZLZ?@??@?@!!
ahahahahahahahaha!!! I LMFAO really hard
Lolü§£
I m p o s s i b l e.
Genius!
Simpson‚Äôs stay predicting the future. Can‚Äôt believe I didn‚Äôt catch on this earlier
idk how bitcoins work but i still laughed
OMG !! IT CRASHEDüòÇ
So do I buy it now? 60% off sounds like a good deal. 
Perfect. 
What episode is this
This is amazing. Too bad it's true...
Bitcoin aside, this is some classic Simpsons. 
8k
Awesome!
This is the mist accurate prediction the Simpsons has ever made.
Old. Bitcoin hit 7K 
If everything was taught via The Simpsons we all would be brighterüëå
"Fucking funniest thing I have seen, give this guy a beer!
"
"This is perfect.

Could someone turn this into a gif or compress it? It's too big to send on mobile for me."
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
The Simpsons really does predict the future.
its scary how accurate it is 
this is actually very true for the past couple of weeks/months.
how did they accurately guess this Jesus Christ they truly are time travelers 
Who the fuck can afford that gold
Who cares about bitcoin when theres reddit gold.
haha this was class
Genius
I want to watch Simpson‚Äôs now!! 
It takes longer than that to load
"I'm so glad it's starting to fall, this isn't an ideal thing to have.

It's meant to be used as a currency, imagine spending 0.00000003 fucking dollars on a coke, it's stupid to have numbers this extreme for buying things. Especially when companies work hard to figure out the best prices to get us to buy stuff ala 99p, 39p 49p etc.

Keep on bringing it down."
"That was great!
I love to see all those 'financial experts' now that tried to make a name for themselves saying how BTC will hit the $50k mark.."
Such an amazing sight, soon enough I‚Äôll be able to buy my GPU that isn‚Äôt double the regular price 
"Old finance guy @ $400 ""bitcoin is a worthless scam""

Old finance guy after -55% crash to $8,000 ""see? Told you!"""
"People call this a ""shitpost"" but it is an accurate post that details the state of the market and cryptocurrency as a whole. "
Inb4 someone steals it to use on twitter without credit
Hello future meme historians.
Can some one create a compilation of these, or maybe a subreddit for them. I love these. Especially the Titanic one before it got removed.
Accurate and funny.
what are hodlers?
[all people holding crypto after this month](https://i.imgur.com/00uDyDJ.gifv) 
Now he gets put back in the ambulance, driven to the hospital and he heals **UP** right? 
There's a Simpsons ep. for every occasion.
"I refuse to sell because the moment I sell the price will definitely go back up again.

You all are going down with me."
my boss bought in at 20k, figured he should get in on this crypo action.
wow, this show has predicted so many things that have come true
proof that /r/HighQualityGifs  could be funny and interesting if they made gifs about anything other than themselves
HODLer's, what's your reasoning? Do you think there will be more suckers with money buying into get rich quick dreams?
This is gold.
"What's it called when you constantly need new buyers to drive profits?

Oh right, ""Ponzi scheme"""
i bought bitcoinn when it got to $10,000 . ive had bitcoin for all of three months .where is my 2000% percent return. answer me
You know, Ive stopped looking at the price this past week, and was genuinely worried as he kept falling down, wondering what number I would see 
"so.... what happens at the end of this episode?
does he go up the cliff and reunite with the hodlers or does he go down the cliff and we're all fucked?"
Hodlers. Lol
That is SO accurate haha
The only inaccurate part is the alts at the top of the cliff watching it fall. The alts went down with bitcoin :(
Top Quality shit post. UPVOTE
"One of my favourite episodes!! This one and [the April fool's one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWDc1mlukfU) where Bart pulls a beer prank that goes terribly... funny. :)

EDIT: Added link"
"needs ""D'hodl!"""
What is dead may never die
The memes are getting better & better. 
I didn‚Äôt sell at 20k because it‚Äôs gonna hit 100k 2019
I can‚Äôt believe BTC investors are so annoyed that people would come in to speculate. There is clearly less value to this currency than the price would suggest in recent weeks. Regardless of whether or not hodlers came into play, a bubble had already started. Convincing yourself otherwise is a fools errand. 
WTF is a hodler 
So guessing this is true ? Will this affect the gpu prices too?
"i saw people bought BTC when it was 16k and changed bio on ""cryptoinvestor"" when the price went up to 20k ;D. hope they will survive"
"Bitcoin would be able to justify its value if people would use it as a currency instead of an investment 

Lately it's turning away from being an alternative mine into just a pump and dump ponzi scheme.   

We need to stop talking about making money from buying and holding and turn our focus back to places that accept bitcoin and talking about thing we bought with bitcoin.  "
They deserve it for fucking the GPU market.
As someone who doesn‚Äôt know a thing about Crypto this really helped sum everything up.
Hodlers
The 8k ending made it for me... üòÇüòÇüòÇ
I‚Äôm not well versed in the Simpsons. Does anyone know what season/episode this is from?
/u/vredditmirrorbot
wow really brilliant
r/bettereveryloop 
I needed this laugh. 
I've been kinda down but this made my day...
I'm over here on the floor dead while everyone is counting their coins.
This summarized everything I wanted to know about what was going on with bitcoin
Hilarious and true!
More pain is yet to come!
One of the best gif's ever.
Brucking filliant ü§£
"Simpsons creators are time travellers :) the others coins should go down also. 

I think he'll lose another 2k before rising again."
This is hilarious 
They predicted trump and now this
"Congrats for reaching r/all/top/ (of the day, top 25) with your post!
&nbsp;

*^I ^am ^a ^bot, ^probably ^quite ^annoying, ^I ^mean ^no ^harm ^though*

*^Message ^me ^to ^add ^your ^account ^or ^subreddit ^to ^my ^blacklist*"
Wow just when you thought it was over it just keeps getting better 
I was wondering why you all got quiet
This is too accurate! xD
Okay, this helps to ease the pain a bit. Ty. :D
"Oh
My
God
This is the most direct visual comparison I could imagine"
LOL, got all time high BTC, still holding :D
Now it's US stock market's turn
well we are going to 3000k. you will need a new animation
"LOOOL this is fucking godl

wouldve been better with the alt coins falling down as wELL AS WE'RE ALL VERY FAMILIAR WITH FALLING WITH BITCOIN"
Remember Bitcoin? It‚Äôs back! In POG form!
The things that fall on Homers head are 1) Altcoin boom and 2) Fake government regulations
Simpsons predicted Bitcoin, again
Best Simpsons ever
Awesome, except all the other coins fell in after, lmao. 
It's perfection
Bitconeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeectüëç
I should watch Simpsons again. I need to know what else they predicted. 
B A B Y S S Q U I R R E L S
Amazing 
How is the value of Bitcoin determined?
I love it! I‚Äôll go now. 
Truly amazing 
Simpson did it first!
This is perfectly made for the bitcoin. Well done Simpsons 
Accurate.
Simpsons did it
The other coins were all falling too, no?
I‚Äôm embarrassed to admit this but I forgot Homer fell out of the ambulance. 
Old simpsons was brutal. 
"I've been lurking on various crypto subreddits for awhile now. I was seriously considering buying in, despite being a broke-ass college student.

I'm pretty sure I've made the right choice now."
Those hodlers must be upset
dear god the reddit video player is hot flaming garbage
Holy shit i haven't laughed so hard in ages
Kudos to whomever made this.
ROFLed so hard when I watched this
Hahaha 
My favorite simpsons scene of all time 
"This is actually my favorite scene in The Simpsons. I remember laughing so hard that I cried and and could barely breathe.

It fits *perfectly*, by the way, so kudos to you OP."
lost my shit
lol
Is this why my friends on social media stopped posting their ‚Äòcrypto gains‚Äô?
