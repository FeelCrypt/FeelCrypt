Well, as I’m here I may as well make this comment useful.

[This Simpson’s Scene also did a celebratory “I’m King of the World”](https://youtu.be/ya2Ww7kDBuk) before Cameron did in Titanic.
What show is this and how did they predict this... even down to the bitcoin logo?!
I can't believe they predicted Bitcoin, not to mention the accurate rise and fall of its value, as well as the logo of all other crypto-currencies
I could have sworn homer's face wasn't a bitcoin. Are you sure it isnt edited?

The Simpsons s02e08 - Bart the Daredevil
You commented too soon.
HA HAAA
"my parents asked me my opinion on bitcoin and i was like ""look you have lived through more bubbles than I have""."
I know it's hard to believe, but it's OC. It took me all afternoon to make.
Same as other financial markets, people buy and sell on exchanges and a mid-market price is discovered and it changes over time based on buy and sell pressure 
Hey maybe you should have sold when things seemed too good to be true at around ~18 or 19k. Oh, you didn’t get that sense? Then quit feeling sorry for yourself... do more research next time. 
I bought Ethereum at it's peak in June when it was $300-400. It dropped to $150 but I kept on holding. After it's recent bull run I'm up 300%. This is how crypto markets work. There is a crazy bull run which goes hyperbolic before pulling back. In theory it will continue this pattern if they become mainstream and are used everyday. Just be patient. It isn't easy, but if you invest in a cryptocurrency which will be widely used 10 years from now then you will be very well off.
10 years into the future, maybe less, maybe more.  I don't expect any 2000% increases beyond that, though.
If it's volatile it's a Ponzi scheme? Lol
"sure you can, there's an episode where a bunch of clone homers run into the ravine

[here's an excerpt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hibFuCP_Rvg)"
"logical fallacy. why?  

1) We have a limited amount of bitcoin to do transactions. Therefore bitcoin must be way higher in price in order to mirror all economical transactions  

2) prices won't be displayed as 0.000003 BTC but as 3 Bits for example. Bitcoin can be broken down to any reasonable measurement unit   "
Hehe, I’ll accept any contribution to the crypto meme economy!

I’ll remember the first time I saw that on live TV and I’ll always upvote any reference.
That sounded like an explosion at the old Simpson place
A *painful* one too.
Yep, capital gains. 
this is a deep uncomfortable truth lmao
and they think that adding distracting blur effects to the words makes the gifs high quality
What they like is stupid as shit though. Like, staring at paint is more entertaining than that sub. 
Holy fuck Sandra bullock will forever keep my spear of Osiris at full mast 
This is also meta. 
"Any examples?

it's like a monkey's paw curse, you get to be amazing at editing gifs but you can't read books, follow the news, or have anything interesting to say about anything that exists, you are not aware of a world beyond after effects tutorials on youtube
Too much meta.
No this is Patrick
The reason we needed an explanation is because they just fall too fast to see what the objects represent. 
My age and the number of Simpsons seasons are the same
One might say it’s even older than Bitcoin itself...
20?..
It's even older than OP...
That was my first thought too seeing ETH and LTC watching from up above. They came down with. 
"You should have put real currencies as the people standing on the cliff watching it fall

Euro, Dollar, etc"
"nah man, didn't you hear everyone screaming how you should hoard currency because ""this will finally end DA THEFTIN' DEEP STATE AND DA JOOOZ and usher in the ANCAP PARADISE."" /s

Obviously the reddit cocophany are the words of an economic genius who surely didn't fail econ 101 while being as conspiratorial and antisemetic as possible. surely.

Bitcoin failed as a currency, now its a hold of value that has no backing other than pure hype and will collapse when the illicit market moves onto other laundering schemes."

Well, the first fall in the GIF was the first part of the bitcoin pullback (December 2017) and the altcoins didn't start to fall until mid-late January. Unfortunately I couldn't portray this in the GIF.

Probably, they will be back later. They are now enjoying  their gains if they did it right.
Commission them to work for you and pay them in Bitcoin. Hey somebody got to get this new economy going, it won't happen if we all just day trade and hodl. 
Meta stops everything they make immediately copied to buzz feed, 9gag and half of the rest of Reddit.
"Hey, that's not fair, they make lots of gifs that aren't just meta!

Now if you said ""anything about themselves *or just fancy subtitles*"", then I'd be saying yeah."

Wtf is a bitcon
"Speculative bubble....just a speculative bubble.....or is it?

Internet slang for bagholder.
Hodl is a typo of Hold, as in owners yelling at other anxious owners to HODL through the dip, rather than sell. 
They're the future hundredaires of the world.
"BTC investors are themselves speculators. They are just mad that they weren't able to con other people. 

They were happy as long as other people were bumping up their prices. They are mad that they didn't see the future and know how to sell at the extreme height. 

They could have all sold a long time ago, but they didn't. 

The coins are still worth far more than most of those hodlers bought for originally. "
You can't invest in an unproven currency.
Yay! Cant wait for my $100!
Ill remember this comment when it hits $500
we are trying to meme bitcoin to 20k
"We thought better memes would get us better ATH’s ;_;"
July ethtrader memes were the pinnacle in recent memory, when ETH crashed by 2/3. 
it is getting the market right 100% in the memes, only if the kids fall as well :) 
The best thing to come out of crypto so far is the memes. Good god they’re so funny. 
"It's how memers spell hold.

So if you see someone using it unironically... Well, just think about what they're saying a bit differently."

"You appear to be the only person who's made the comparison (I just used gold as an example in my last response to someone else) and you're not wrong to compare the two but you forget that gold has metalurgic and cosmetic properties that drive demand as well as the fact that certain currencies are still backed by gold. 

This is not the case for Bitcoin and represents a fundamental difference between the two. The only demand for Bitcoin comes from speculation."

"**HODL**

HODL is a slang term and Internet meme that is used in the Bitcoin community when referring to keeping, i.e. holding onto the cryptocurrency rather than selling it. It originated in a December 2013 post on the Bitcoin Forum message board by an apparently inebriated user who posted with a typo in the subject, ""I AM HODLING."" In 2017, Quartz listed it as one of the essential slang terms in Bitcoin culture, and described it as a stance, ""to stay invested in bitcoin and not to capitulate in the face of plunging prices."" The Street.com referred to it as the ""favorite mantra"" of Bitcoin holders. According to the Financial Times, it was the reddit forum Buttcoin that helped popularize its use.

"No, like I said-- the value can only increase with new buyers because there are no earnings (like with equities) or interest (like with bonds) or trade imbalances (like with forex) to create a natural appreciation of value. 100% of the value of BTC comes from speculation (on what remains a mystery).

I don't know how you got to volatility but I'm certain you can't provide any reason why Bitcoin would appreciate in value if, in a hypothetical situation, every coin had been mined and everyone chose to hold. 99% of Bitcoin and other crypto investors have no idea what they're doing."
"Do you see how faulty the logic is? There isn't an infinite supply of suckers with money to lose. Just because crypto hasn't hit that limit before, doesn't mean it won't in the future. You're just betting that right now there's still enough suckers to drive crypto value to another higher peak.

"Bitcoin would be able to justify its value if people would use it as a currency instead of an investment

"i saw people bought BTC when it was 16k and changed bio on ""cryptoinvestor"" when the price went up to 20k ;D. hope they will survive"
So guessing this is true ? Will this affect the gpu prices too?
WTF is a hodler 
I can’t believe BTC investors are so annoyed that people would come in to speculate. There is clearly less value to this currency than the price would suggest in recent weeks. Regardless of whether or not hodlers came into play, a bubble had already started. Convincing yourself otherwise is a fools errand.

There's a Simpsons ep. for every occasion.
You know, Ive stopped looking at the price this past week, and was genuinely worried as he kept falling down, wondering what number I would see 
Now he gets put back in the ambulance, driven to the hospital and he heals **UP** right?

Simpson’s stay predicting the future. Can’t believe I didn’t catch on this earlier

Who cares about bitcoin when theres reddit gold.
Who the fuck can afford that gold
how did they accurately guess this Jesus Christ they truly are time travelers 
this is actually very true for the past couple of weeks/months.
its scary how accurate it is 
Lmao😂😭
The Simpsons really does predict the future.
"This is perfect.

Could someone turn this into a gif or compress it? It's too big to send on mobile for me."
"Fucking funniest thing I have seen, give this guy a beer!
"
Genius
If everything was taught via The Simpsons we all would be brighter👌
This is the mist accurate prediction the Simpsons has ever made.
Awesome!
8k
Bitcoin aside, this is some classic Simpsons. 
This is amazing. Too bad it's true...
What episode is this
Perfect. 
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Explained clearly...Crystal clear!!
That's really awesome :D
What episode is this from?
Thats what you get when bunch of time travellers write script
This clip is probably older than most of the people who have invested in bitcoin.
What it lacks is half the kids falling down after him and then being left down there.
having them watch was a nice touch, since most (all?) markets follow bitcoin right now
Yeah, unfortunately I couldn't really show that. :/
"It starts at 5k and ends ""lower"" at 13k"
the crazy part is that this episode is 20 years old and unedited 
It takes longer than that to load
I want to watch Simpson’s now!! 
ahahahahahahahaha!!! I LMFAO really hard
LOZLZ?@??@?@!!
"Hodlers?

"Remember Bitcoin? It’s back! In POG form!

"

"Im sure someone has already asked this, im sorry i cant find that post.
Where/how can i download and share this work of art? Please?"
Does this mean GPUs will finally be buyable for the normal user again ?
but it's still worth 7k. so if you bought it at 1:1 then you have 7 grand now
Haha love it!
OMG !! IT CRASHED😂
So do I buy it now? 60% off sounds like a good deal. 
idk how bitcoins work but i still laughed
Dem hodlers!
Now if only we had a Gif of a junkie shooting up Gas 50,000 in an ally with Ethereum in the baggie

It's time to die.
Amazing 
The Simpson's predicted bitcoin
[deleted]
They've predicted the future more than once now
This is me but with TRON. I’m just hoping one day I can cash out during a bull run and buy some McDonalds with my earnings.
Hilarious.
Are the shitposts back? Does that mean Bitcoin will reach a new ATH??
Beautiful
Wiley e Coyote memes are better.
[deleted]
Quality shitpost. 
7k* haha
Best thing I've seen this week, thank you
"And people here laughed at me here when I said bitcoin is tulip mania 2.0

Mark my words, bitcoin is gonna crash down to 3k or even lower by mid 2018. But I guess at least the smart people cashed out when it was 15k+, while the idiot hodlers cling to a bubble."
"Haha awesome video man.

You missed the end bit. BITCOIN TO THE MOON"
Holy shit, thank you for making me laugh for the first time in a few days.  When the ambulance hit the tree I lost my shit.
wtf is a hodler? 
I'm surprised to see it was only gilded once.. 
Is Hodlers a meme or misspelt?
XD
Vreddit sucks
D'oh!
This is gold. 
Lol very funny and so true!!!! 
So what does it all mean?
It’s all the hodlers fault, clearly.
Bahahaha 
😂😂
lol so true
Eerie...
So good!
"Remember the days when Bitcoin was ""currency"" and not an ""investment?"""

Honestly, I know I'm prolly gonna get hate but next time Bitcoin plunges should I buy?
