Because people are willing to buy it
"In addition to what others have said, there are a few other theoretical ideas behind why it has value:

* It was designed from day one to be a trustless currency and store of value separate from any central control, meaning no government or bank has the ability to print more money (there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins created) or prevent you from sending money anywhere, etc.

* It is pseudonymous -- it is very difficult to trace a particular account back to a particular person. It *is* possible to trace transactions in certain circumstances, especially when using external aggregate info (like the IRS demanding info from Coinbase) but in general it is pretty private.

* It is extremely secure and well-designed. The original designer solved two of the toughest problems in computer science history to invent it, and it has been upgraded over the years by some of the best cryptographers on the planet.

* It is very censorship-resistant and attack-resistant. Look up the term ""anti-fragile"" -- basically every time it is attacked (hundreds of times now) it just gets stronger. This makes people trust it more.

* It takes an *extreme* amount of electricity to mine it. The mining network is effectively orders of magnitude stronger than the fastest supercomputer -- it was [four exahashes per second in 2016](https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-hashrate-four-exahash-per-second/) and ""the growth of mining pools has led many people to believe bitcoin is the most secure computational network in history."" Miners want to get their money's worth. It is highly likely that they manipulate the markets to drive prices up to make it worth their while."

Aren't you supposed to tell the joke ON April 1st?
"But will be able to post about it when it happens for sweet, sweet karma. Which will be good as the parent poster probably doesn't own a whole bitcoin so may as well get something out of the deal.

"Well, they would also be in the FOMO and ""It's going to the moon!"" mindset when buying. Moreover, everyone here seems to joke about ""buying the dip after it hits $100k from $90k but coming from a surge from $20k"""
If I sold my crypto at every 10-20% gain, I'd probably have a lot less money.
"1) It's not investing, it's gambling. Might as well be buying penny stock.

2) Buy the dip and sell off at the earliest signs of a bubble (~10-20% gain.)

3) Withdraw your principal wager as soon as you can. Only play with profits. This is a game, not a real investment."
"In addition to having value because people will buy it, it has value because it has utility - Bitcoin is a different way to think about money.

* You can send Bitcoin to anyone with internet access without worrying about banks or borders in less time than the legacy banking system.

* You can store money with Bitcoin without worrying about physically storing or protecting gold or physical bills - you can even memorize a series of words so that your bitcoins can only be accessed by you, and you can do so anywhere in the world with an internet connection.

* Bitcoin is designed to be a deflationary system. Where as currencies like the dollar will lose value every year due to inflation, this doesn't happen with Bitcoin. "
"It started forever ago.

No CPA would ever say like kind is allowed ever...

If euros to USD isn't like kind, and gold to silver isn't like kind, and selling facebook for google isn't like kind, why the hell would trading ETH and BTC be like kind?

You'd be better off just not reporting taxes at all, you'll be less of a target than willingly turning over evidence of you breaking the law.

Edit: to explain a bit more, like-kind was meant for non-fungible items. It's so you can treat 2 diamonds with roughly similar qualities as the same thing even though they are uniquely identifiable and might have different values in the future. It's not so you can trade assets other than USD and not pay taxes."

Already did at 1500 before the drop. 
If you are trying to do it all at the end of the year it might take awhile. However if you just keep track of your transactions as you go there’s really no problem. Most exchanges can also export your data and they all have a history so we really it shouldn’t be a problem anyways.

"**Dot-com bubble**

The dot-com bubble (also known as the dot-com boom, the dot-com crash, the Y2K crash, the Y2K bubble, the tech bubble, the Internet bubble, the dot-com collapse, and the information technology bubble) was a historic economic bubble and period of excessive speculation that occurred roughly from 1997 to 2001, a period of extreme growth in the usage and adaptation of the Internet by businesses and consumers. During this period, many Internet-based companies, commonly referred to as dot-coms, were founded, many of which failed.

During 2000–2002, the bubble collapsed. Some companies, such as Pets.com and Webvan, failed completely and shut down.

Lol right on. I guess I never thought of it that way
Still, it’s strange. It was at 16k around Boxing Day as well and dipped to 13-14 until now. Just strange that people are so sure of its turnaround when it literally dipped from 20k to 13 a month ago. It’s not like it reached a new high. I get optimism, but this much? Seemed like it would be a sign of more value.

If you think crypto is anything like regular currencies, when it comes to value, you're fucking retarded.
The difference is the dollar has a very powerful military behind it to remind people of its value, in case anyone should forget. 
Mining just like mining gold costs something so does mining bitcoin. Creates a barrier on how low it can go 
Most of the above comments are accurate, but to me, it has value because it is a distributed ledger of every transaction ever made using bitcoin thus making it a trustless and decentralized tool for people to use to transfer value from one person directly to another without a third party (i.e. banks) in between. 
How is converting your currency considered a purchase? I don’t understand that.

From /r/all and don’t know anything about Bitcoin. How does it have value?
"Come on, I know you probably support ""the blockchain technology"" but Bitcoin is no longer a useful currency, and its functionality as a shit currency is certainly not where it derives its value from. It may be currency on paper, but in exchanges, it is a speculative asset.

>This is a totally unprecedented situation, market, etc.

Please do not fall for this age-old ""new paradigm"" trap. You will end up losing money and convincing others to lose their money. Bitcoin is nothing special, at all, period. I say this as an owner.

>None of us know what’s going to happen with the crypto currencies market.

If BTC's mainstream use case is not realized within the next year or two, I can certainly give you a good prediction what will happen with it. BTC is under the spotlight today, it can't keep being that internet money with massive fees and slow processing times used to buy drugs online. "

"Understand Bitcoin first. It came first for a reason. Learn about decentralization via nodes, the basics of the blockchain and mining, the economics - 21 million total supply and how it's distributed, and what all that allows us to do.

Then you can begin to understand the value of both new features to Bitcoin (Segwit, lightning, etc.) and altcoins for how they change the basics of Bitcoin, add new features, and/or focus on a specific use case."

In my eyes bitcoin is far more a commodity than currency. I send money using ETH. I store value in BTC.
Houses man, houses. Pay attention!
"Except you live in a house.

And you.... wait what do you do with a Bitcoin."
No but your mother's still a whore.
I like to go a step deeper and use another interest free card that gives loyalty points to pay off the original card that I used to pay for crypto.
Wouldn't that be treated as a cash advance and have higher fees? I know most/all cards charge more for that kind of stuff.
Hey man, whatever helps you pull the trigger 😂

"It was rarely used because some people couldnt find too many places that accepted it. Completely different.

Don’t buy then, but I don’t know tho.

You might be able to catch some of the bigger moves but BTC is a 24 hour market, I'm not cut out for that type of commitment. Can I go to bed? Nope, I haven't bought back in yet, and it could be +$2000 when I get up? Guess I'm staying awake tonight lol 

But if you want to go long, you just buy in, save some money for when it dips and buy more. THAT is easy. "
"no, definitely not that easy.

best bet is to dollar cost average in over time, especially if you are brand fucking new. "
"Nope. In fact, if you wait, you can miss out on where the next crash will be.

i.e. it shoots up by so much that it only falls down to way above the point you waited.

Happened to my physicist friend. She waited. Back at $7500.

But yeah FOMO is powerful, don't do crazy things."

That’s exactly what he meant when he said timing is only obvious in retrospect. You would have had no way of knowing what you posted. It could crash tomorrow and never recover. 
"Yeah but look at the chart, the recent run was pretty distinct. Also Bitcoin has dipped 30+% multiple times, at once like 80% (not too long after I bought in, lol)

Just basic risk management tells you to dollar cost average your way in with multiple buys. Going all in at once is pretty greedy "
"Uh, no, it's still gambling. I lost everything when Gox closed. Zero.

Make no mistake: It can happen to you, on Coinbase, right now. Your coins aren't insured. No one would underwrite the value of their cold storage."
The difference between OT and digital currency is you earn OT.  Capital gains will be taxed HEAVY because its investing - not labor.  Also, when you transfer in and out of the non-alt coin's you will be taxed on the gains of all outside trades & and the gains off the BTC (example).  So by the end of it, you will have already likely spent the money, or have it held up in some other crypto, which you will then need to withdraw - take another tax on - and continue the viscous cycle.  AKA, if you have a lot of $$$ in crypto, go hire a tax adviser or read up online.  
Also the converse about write-offs. 
"I seriously spent way to much time trying to explain this to a guy at work the other day. His promotion at work was moving him from one tax bracket to another. He was trying to figure out how he could decline his annual step promotion since it was ""only an extra thousand dollars a year"" and I'll end up paying way more than that from my higher taxes. Even after finishing our long ass talk of trying to explain how tiered income brackets works, I'm still not sure he understands it and thinks he'll end up losing money from making more. "
"You could give people unlimited health care that added a $100 a year to their taxes, and they'd prefer to keep paying the $400+ a month for insurance instead because ""my taxes"". "
"Drives me crazy when people tell me this like when we get a 10,000.00 bonus. ""Oh, but you gotta pay taxes on it."" For real? You're gonna pass on 7,500 because you have to pay 2,500 in taxes?! GTFO!!"
"""I don't want that million dollars cash because I'd have to pay taxes on it"" - some people's logic "
Coinbase isn't making it a cash advance, your credit card can be, and yes there are many charges that don't qualify for rewards
The merchant wouldn’t be charging you an APR. 
its more than any card pays in cash back/rewards, though it would qualify for the bonus intro points many cards give. Its a reasonable one time purchase, but I don't think its sustainable on its own without trading profit. 
Yeah, but how often do you open up new cards?
"lol bitcoin investor calling churning insane. 

Churning is basically no-risk low-risk. It just takes a bit of footwork.

"I'm only telling you what my strategy is
"
"You need to move them to your personal wallet after purchasing them in an exchange.

Exchanges aren't underwritten, so if they collapse - for example if they were fractional reserve selling and there's a run on the bank - you'd be unable to access your funds. "
"The coins are stored where you put them.

If you put them in your wallet, which you control, then you have nothing to worry about. Don't lose the keys to your wallet. Use the encryption that comes with the program. Write down the 24 words to regenerate your wallet in case of disaster, then store those words at your bank's deposit box in case your house burns down.

When you buy coins, Coinbase will assure you they are safe. But they're sitting on their servers, in their wallet, like a bank. You have to take them off Coinbase to ever be safe.

I did not. I lost them. Would have $200k now. Don't be me.

(Oh, who am I joking.. I would have sold them or squandered them via day trading, like everyone else. Force hodl is best hold. Maybe Gox will someday return 20% so I can recoup my initial investment at least."
I've got mine in cold storage too, but I can't help but wonder what would happen to the value of bitcoin if Coinbase actually went under
If they failed as a business though you're still fucked. 
yeah a bunch of americans are really that stupid lol, it sucks

Dude. Who leaves their coins on the exchange? Move that shit into cold storage. 90% of mine are on  a ledger nano s. Coinbase can crash and burn. My stuff is fine. 
"> No one would underwrite the value of their cold storage.

You would be correct there, but at least the online Coinbase funds actually *are* insured, as well as your USD. 

https://support.coinbase.com/customer/portal/articles/1662379-how-is-coinbase-insured-"
That's a common belief where I work also! I don't know where it came from, it's almost like there was some kind of propaganda from leadership telling people that earning more will lead to losing money because of the higher tax bracket.
Is this a thing? As an European it sounds insane!
It’s actually better if your employer makes you pay taxes out of it anyways 
This is because people think if they get bumped into a higher tax bracket, all of their earning are taxed at the new rate. 
Where in my post did I say coinbase is charging for a cash advance? How would that make any sense? Coinbase charges higher fees for credit cards and I said those are lower than the APR for a cash advance. You do realize this is a thread about purchases with an interest free period of a credit card right?

The title implied, to me, that public interest in Bitcoin picked up again. I viewed the interest as going down these past few weeks because the price went down durastically and probably turned some people off.

"I personally don't think the US or its military is going anywhere soon, but history is littered with powerful countries whose currency dipped significantly in value soonafter.

Maybe I'm projecting as a US citizen, but you can ask Venezuela or Greece how centralized backing of a currency is working for them."
The same reason anything has value. 
Super interesting.
I'm still confused what mining Bitcoin means? Where are they mining from? And how is the 22 million limit upheld since as far as I know there's no centralization in the Bitcoin system 
Another important thing is that the network is permissionless. Anyone can start processing transactions, and anyone can hold or transfer coins. You don't have to ask to join. 
Well it has real value as well. It costs quite a bit of energy to mine bitcoin so we can assume some of that value is transferred. 
Brother did it to me 4 days after April fools and was trying to convince me I got a girl pregnant.

Sure, buy at 20k- but if you really don't save some cash to buy a dip, you are asking to bag hold. This goes for every investment known to man "

Yeah if you aren't getting fresh seed keys from the device throw that thing in the trash 
No. Previous owner can recover the wallet with seed key
But them pies tho
Sure it is, but bitcoin doesn’t have a government behind it, and that is a difference. And it’s a big one. 
Cryptocurrency really is an amazing technology. Anyone can participate at any time without licenses or anything. It's the wild west right now. I predict within ten years there will be some form of regulation imposed on the system, but for now it is pretty much wide open. The markets are almost completely unregulated, which leads to massive 100x gains but also high risk due to manipulation.
First the limit is 21 million. Second mining is the solving of a mathmaticaly hard problem to verify a block, a block is a group of transactions linked to the previous block for a block to be accepted the miners must find a number which when put into a function with the block it gives a value below the current difficulty* because this problem is hard miners pick random numbers and check if it makes the block valid if it does they broadcast the new valid block to the network, in return they get a reward, new bitcoins. Third the limit is enforced by the colective if a miner trys to gI've himself more bitcoins all the nodes notice that, the reward value is wrong and they drop the block and the miner has wasted time and money to try that so he lost money so he won't do that in the first place.
"It sounds like you need to type in ""what is bitcoin"" into youtube and watch at least 1 intro video. "
"That's putting the cart before the horse. Miners are willing to pay high electricity bills because Bitcoin is that valuable, not the other way around.

If I [spend $1500 to make a sandwich in the least efficient way possible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URvWSsAgtJE), that doesn't mean the sandwich is now worth $1500 and anyone will buy it from me for that price.

Unless they *really* like the idea of a hand-crafted sandwich I guess.

But basically, [""real"" value isn't a thing](https://mises.org/library/introduction-value-theory) – value is always subjective."
So it will inevitably drop again. Wait til it drops , buy before it starts to jump , and sell at a high point. Is it really that easy?
"What you say is true and logical and all that, but note that if you bought BTC any time in the last couple years, you'd be up by a huge amount now.

Any time. Doesn't matter if it was at the absolute peak or not.

"
There's also the constant drag that the whole thing is bullshit when you're doing it. So I have to pay 30% when I change to fiat, plus a percentage on each trade that got me there? How much has my sovereign government facilitated these gains? Not hugely. I'm fine with paying some to keep social infrastructure rolling, but at a certain point they're asking for (legal) evasion.
Niice, I am excited for you and to see how high the price will go. The hardest thing now will be deciding when to actually sell. I like your backup plan btw! Florida is nice this time of year. 
"Honestly you have a good plan.

Good luck to you. Be wise when it pays off and dont do the same strategy ;)"
Also how you end up spending $4000 on Amazon because you don't want to fly anywhere and its all free points anyways so...I got a ton of stuff for 2 months straight but now, no idea what to buy.
I paid off my credit card debt with gains earned from cryptos that I bought with my credit card. YMMV
Not when you’re looking to “disrupt” said industry 😤😁

"People love to point out that earning more will lead to you paying more taxes for some reason, as if somehow you'll end up getting taxed an amount greater than the earnings. Happens all the time when people notice me working OT at work -- ""Sure you might earn a little more, but TAXES!!"""
Oh that was either a long time ago or those people are really bad at reading. Coinbase charges a fee to use a credit card and it's no where near the typically 25.99%+ APR for a cash advance. 
Like exchange fees? You can rack up some pretty decent air mileage points buying crypto. Many cards have bonuses such as “spend 1000 in first 3 months get 75k points”. You were going to spend that money anyways, might as well have a couple free flights too.
^this guy doesn’t credit card.
/r/shittychurning
That sub is sorta kinda insane though
Which if it’s on a card you don’t actually have that money to lose
I'm only telling you what my strategy is
How does this relate to people asking if they should sell when the market dips and if they should buy when it starts rising? This is why this gets posted. The market is moving enough to have people constantly ask questions.
idk about absolutely insane yet. Whats insane is people at a casino using cash advance for slot machines. That's guaranteed to lose you money, but they do it.
wow i never even thought about people using their credit cards to buy crypto. If they can pay that off quick enough or get large enough gains - it's almost a guarantee they will lose money

"I bought some @19k with 4 of my colleagues at the same time.they were new to this.
And now when it dropped to 13k ,i was amused at their faces daily."
I sold my bitcoin. Got tired of the uncertainty. Bought some nice subwoofers with my earnings.
"A meme I can truly relate to. A coworker asked me if I've heard about bitcoin and if she should buy. I didn't tell her I'd been nearly obsessively reading about it for several years, and basically just offered some vague ""learn about it before you buy"" and ""it could go to $0 or $1,000,000"" type of advice. Told her to watch some Andreas Antonopoulos on youtube, hah.

I think that's about the best ""advice"" I could have offered, not being much of a investment guru."

You’re not serious. People didn’t actually do that, did they?
That's sooo 2017
Well it was a gamble. 45% of people who put their money on the roulette wheel, on red, don't regret it either. 
">  I cannot believe people were taking out second mortgages to buy BTC in 2017.

Every time asks me about BTC I try to include the example of morons taking out second mortgages but buy in and make clear the person understands that even if bitcoin skyrockets and you turn your $250,000 loan into $100,000,000 they'd be complete morons. 

Likewise I also make sure they understand that invest and later sell for a nice profit they should not be hard on themselves if they could have made more money. As in ""oh no I turned $1,000 into $5,000 when I really wasn't comfortable with risking losing all of it at that point, but if I'd held on 2 more years I could have had $500,000"" and then launching into a spiral of depression that potentially results in suicide. You shouldn't hate yourself for failing to be psychic, don't risk anything you're unwilling to lose and enjoy whatever gains you get if you get them."

“I’m not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice”

"This has been the best way to go about it. If someone is actually interested in doing this then I tell them to setup a bittrex/binance account and I send them $50 in whatever my short term alts are along with the sell targets for them. And we setup their blockfolio account. This teaches them that one day they'll be up 15% and another they'll be down 40%. But a week later they're up 200%. We practice placing orders and stop losses. 

I show them charts so they can understand the basics of TA (flags, wedges, all that shit). I show them a calendar site so they can see what news is coming down the way for what coin. I show them how to use explorers. I tell them that when bitcoin pumps weak alts bleed out. Show them how to set alarms. I show them my top 5 favorite youtube crypto channels. Who to follow on twitter and telegram.

It's kinda fun to see them research and find their own coins and make their own moves. It gives them an appreciation for how this thing works and what it takes.

Some people offer to give me their money and ask me to trade it for them, but that kinda sucks the fun out of this. I don't want to be responsible for someone elses money. Can't effectively trade under stress like that. Need to be comfy during dips. If I had to cut losses every time a price dropped 10% then their holdings would dwindle down to nothing. "

"So true. I tell everyone, ""but don't invest more than you're willing to stack in a heap and light on fire."" "
"The only advice I’ve ever given was to never sell everything. Keep some (maybe 50%) just in case what you think is going to happen doesn’t. This was based on some of my previous experience of trading stocks.

I had a friend who bought 10@~$3500. He ended up selling 5@$7000. He wishes he hadn’t now, but imagine how bad he’d have felt had he sold it all (of course a 2x gain is still awesome no matter what).

Why is this post getting so much attention right now? The price hasn’t really changed. Am I missing something?
Anyone who relies solely on another's advice without doing any research of their own shouldn't be doing any investing anyway.
If someone is stupid enough to invest enough money in crypto that it would ruin their life they're probably well on their way to doing that anyway

"The best advice is just HOLD.  There have been many days where my limit orders have magically hit the low for the buy side and hit the high for the sell. You feel like a genius. But it's also taken a ton of time, mental anguish, staring and refreshing.  Sad part is I've missed some very big run up as even when I pick a high sell limit much higher than the current going exchange rate.  It fills and keeps going much higher.  When I've re entered I've lost fees, exchange fees, and of course a high price etc. I've ended up with definitely less BTC or some alt coins than I should have.  

I do have to say one piece of advice as I exit some coins and buy some others is set a low, low limit exchange ratio price when buying.  Sure you miss out on some buys but they almost always fill because of some flash crash, unsteady hands, fud etc.  

Don't keep changing your limit order buy price higher as those .0001 higher price add up especially when buying the cheapo alt coins, you can sometimes get 50000 more coins but just setting a low limit buy price and not worrying about it.  "
"I used to tell all my friends to buy bitcoin, back when it was in the $2000 range. They didn't listen. As soon as they heard the news of it hitting 15k+, they were asking me all about it. As soon as it became a mainstream affair, I stopped talking about it.

I really hate when other people tell me how I should spend or invest my money. Especially everyone who tells me to sell during a crash because ""it's going to zero!""

Every man for himself, I'm not giving you investment advice for shit."

"A few did in the beginning. Most of the ones after that which went semi-viral turned out to be hoaxes, and people looking for scam-pity tips to recoup their losses. But yeah, a few did.

"Crypto currencies are not commodities. They are currencies. It’s right in the term. Some are commodity currencies, but most are not, including BTC.

I can’t do it. I’m diversified. In an untested industry like this I did not put anything more into it than I could afford to lose. But with that being said, it’s the people who are willing to risk everything who walk away with lambos in 3 years, if that’s what you care about. "

On the exchange you don’t have a personal wallet. Instead, exchanges like coinbase keep a record of your balance and manage their own wallets. That’s why many people (especially those here) like to keep their coins in a hardware or other personal wallet.

Huh? That's all like french to me lol. I'm new to this. I have all my bitcoin on xcoins and 15% is the lowest they'll allow. I'm in the US but so far no exchange I've found supports my bank or direct paypal cashouts. I'm really just trying to sell all my bitcoin for cash straight up. Help?
Yet it has the hallmarks of a good currency: fast with a 60 Second block time and its inflationary which encourages spending it. 
all the exchanges have limit orders, you must do your due diligence, binance, gdax, are the major ones.  I'd do more due diligence on the smaller ones, as those are the ones with the cheapo coins.

"The Internet wasn't an attempt to replace something nearly identical to it without a real underlying purpose. What does cryptocurrency do that fiat currencies can't?

May cause insomnia or make you drowsy.
The internet in 1993 was rarely used. 
It 100000% is and you can especially see this in the pump of another coin the other day, Tron, where the price rose over 500% over a product most people would value at 1 million on a good day (cryptopuppies, kind of like a shitty basic app game). The coin reached a market cap of 19 billion. The thing is, most people realize it's a bubble but no one cares as they're making money rn. I guess when the bubble bursts everyone's hoping they won't be the ones left holding the bag of shitty coins.

"Bitcoin is easily in a giant speculative bubble, you can't exactly use it as an effective currency at the moment because of the massive fees that may or may not be fixed sometime in the future. The question is by how much and if every other cryptocurrency is in a speculative bubble. As it stands we have no idea of the actual worth of cryptocurrency and bitcoin is still divisible down the point where you can buy multiple fractions for a cent.

Personally, I would buy a later generation cryptocurrency like Etherium or Dash because I don't really like the people running bitcoin at the moment nor their plans and even then only if I were to actually use it as a currency. But idk tho."
