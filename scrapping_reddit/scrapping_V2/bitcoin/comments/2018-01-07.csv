Me.
This is me like all the time on /r/gamedesign
BTC needs to blackmail the worlds political class as the bankers have and become to big to fail, then it will truly compete. Until then it's just a plaything.
I never even talk about my investing. It keeps me out of these situations. 
"Everybody on TradingView who starts their idea with ""this is not certified advice"""
Can confirm, currently ruining life.
Seriously, my heart literally stopped for a second or two. The moment I saw this meme I got that picture in my head the price was dropping below 10 K. Not cool
Still a beginner here - just wondering how much you guys invest at a time? 100 USD? Or higher/lower? And where is your usual limit
"My friend is really into this stuff. I gave him $20 bucks to invest back in November. I am not into this stuff but thought why the hell not see what Reddit had to offer. I would tell him whenever there is a buzz about any coin here follow by a ""but I don't know."" "
"""Don't pitch the bitch""."
best of the day
true as fuck
Always cover your ass. Money will get people heated more than anything else. 
Lmao
-Is a bubble
Straight to the moon!!!!!!! Also 1 Doge = 1 Doge
honestly tho
My MIL thinks I‚Äôm an investing genius. My gains are modest compared to others (105% gain overall in 5 months), but it‚Äôs no where near moon money. I‚Äôm finding it‚Äôs a fun way to spend money that probably would‚Äôve been spent on crap. I‚Äôm in 5 different coins, but researching now what to invest into next.

All the people selling illegal drugs online in exchange for bitcoin the past few years are balling right now 
Can anyone catch me up on what happened[with BC](https://youtu.be/Vj9OVLKk8Bk) 
Who's trading? Why don't they HODL
Hahaha this is me 
[removed]
"More like - "" but idk cause I'm an autistic brain dead full retard who loves to lose money """
"""I'm not taking advice from you."""
And you wonder why they don't take it seriously
This is the worst part of bitcoin 
TRUTH
"I bought some @19k with 4 of my colleagues at the same time.they were new to this.
And now when it dropped to 13k ,i was amused at their faces daily."
I sold my bitcoin. Got tired of the uncertainty. Bought some nice subwoofers with my earnings.
"A meme I can truly relate to. A coworker asked me if I've heard about bitcoin and if she should buy. I didn't tell her I'd been nearly obsessively reading about it for several years, and basically just offered some vague ""learn about it before you buy"" and ""it could go to $0 or $1,000,000"" type of advice. Told her to watch some Andreas Antonopoulos on youtube, hah.

I think that's about the best ""advice"" I could have offered, not being much of a investment guru."
I was telling my friend tonight ‚Äúevery dollar I put in bitcoin is a dollar I‚Äôm willing to lose‚Äù
DAE HODL because FOMO?
Haha truuu! 
We'll see what families are talking about next holiday season.
That's me everyday
Im feeling slow at this point, everyone know how this works and making tons of cash üí∞ 
I literally did this 5 minutes ago
/r/all ! But idk tho
When your entire currency is sustained by reddit memes
Regardless of the situation if they are asking you for financial investment or decisions, its still lies on them as they are deciding to trust you, and deciding on your decision not theirs. 
too real
"i never think id see a kanye meme here on /r/Bitcoin 
shoutout to the wavy bois at /r/kanye "
"I basically do this every time I give anyone advice about anything. Like, this is how I'd do it, but that's just me. Or, if it were me I'd do this, but it's up to you. 

Sounding matter-of-fact about something and then being wrong is kind of embarrassing so, the solution: Never be confident in anything you say! It's like have everyone you talk to sign a waiver, like this is what you're doing but if it blows up in your face it ain't on me. "
‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt financial advice‚Äù
Yeap. This is how I ruined bunch of friends' lives with silver and gold. 
"Anyone want to ELI5 how this isn't just a massive bubble? As far as I can tell it's cryptocurrency is rarely used for actual purchases, and it's effectively just people buying it and holding it based on the speculation that it will increase in value, with the expectation of converting it back to fiat currency when they ""cash out""."
[deleted]
"So true. I tell everyone, ""but don't invest more than you're willing to stack in a heap and light on fire."" "
"The only advice I‚Äôve ever given was to never sell everything. Keep some (maybe 50%) just in case what you think is going to happen doesn‚Äôt. This was based on some of my previous experience of trading stocks.

I had a friend who bought 10@~$3500. He ended up selling 5@$7000. He wishes he hadn‚Äôt now, but imagine how bad he‚Äôd have felt had he sold it all (of course a 2x gain is still awesome no matter what).

"
Yeah I also do this but I have convinced 0 people to invest. I've made decent returns too but every person I tell is too scared
Bitcoin grandpa is still in the green thoooo
Why is this post getting so much attention right now? The price hasn‚Äôt really changed. Am I missing something?
Anyone who relies solely on another's advice without doing any research of their own shouldn't be doing any investing anyway.
If someone is stupid enough to invest enough money in crypto that it would ruin their life they're probably well on their way to doing that anyway
"‚ÄúYeah man you should get in. Mcafee is gonna eat his dick if it hits a million....


... or it might be zero tomorrow.‚Äù

- me, three nights ago. "
"I got tired of people at work asking me about Bitcoin ""dude it's crashing are you gonna sell? Are you selling?"" 


For the last time fucking NO i told you I was holding 

*guy sells for 11.4k* 

*bitcoin bounces back*

""Dude should I get back in? Is it going to keep going up"" 

Fucking hell. Now when people ask me I just go ""idk"" and nothing else "
"I don't even bother giving advice anymore. Instead I'll try to steer them toward learning about what Bitcoin actually is, how it works, and why we want it to work that way. The more they learn about crypto, the better decisions they can make for themselves about Bitcoin and altcoins. 

No one should be investing in this without at least a basic understanding of how all this works. "
YEEZY COIN  IS AT 00.5 BIG GAINS üí™üèæ
"You should definitely invest in crypto currency! 

But idk you could end up spooning your dog on the streets of Russia. "
Long x100 leverage with remortgaged house. WCGW???
Be careful you might bet rich!

‚ÄúBut yo do you‚Äù

"I start with ""idk tho"" and ""are you ready to go from get-rich-quick to long-term-investor""."
Lolol
"The best advice is just HOLD.  There have been many days where my limit orders have magically hit the low for the buy side and hit the high for the sell. You feel like a genius. But it's also taken a ton of time, mental anguish, staring and refreshing.  Sad part is I've missed some very big run up as even when I pick a high sell limit much higher than the current going exchange rate.  It fills and keeps going much higher.  When I've re entered I've lost fees, exchange fees, and of course a high price etc. I've ended up with definitely less BTC or some alt coins than I should have.  

I do have to say one piece of advice as I exit some coins and buy some others is set a low, low limit exchange ratio price when buying.  Sure you miss out on some buys but they almost always fill because of some flash crash, unsteady hands, fud etc.  

Don't keep changing your limit order buy price higher as those .0001 higher price add up especially when buying the cheapo alt coins, you can sometimes get 50000 more coins but just setting a low limit buy price and not worrying about it.  "
"I used to tell all my friends to buy bitcoin, back when it was in the $2000 range. They didn't listen. As soon as they heard the news of it hitting 15k+, they were asking me all about it. As soon as it became a mainstream affair, I stopped talking about it.

I really hate when other people tell me how I should spend or invest my money. Especially everyone who tells me to sell during a crash because ""it's going to zero!""

Every man for himself, I'm not giving you investment advice for shit."
"""it's your money you should decide what to do and don't listen to others but I...."""
this is me
"I think honestly if you put enough money to ""ruin your life"" into any changing market then you deserve to see it go south. Don't make stupid decisions and expect nothing negative to come out of it."
Is there a way to invest in BTC with only iPhone? Like apps or anything
https://imgur.com/MrCW3fC
And here I am watching all of this play out from the safety of not owning a single Bitcoin or any other Crypto.
Wow this was literally what I did just a few minutes before reading this now. Spooky.
It's going to the moon, but I don't know though
Do your own research is my go to advice.
You need to diversify your cryptos n**** - Wu-Tang Financial
