Hey /r/all, feel free to check out [/r/Bitcoin's FAQ thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6jlop4/rbitcoin_faq_newcomers_please_read/) if you're interested in learning more. Lots of exciting things have happened this year and there's more to come, so be sure to subscribe and follow along. Never a boring day in Bitcoin!
Because then you'd have to become a sodler to buy food. 
Sell it. Reap your profits. You still technically lost $80 until you’ve sold. It’s only worth as much as you can get someone else to pay for it. 
yes
Thank you for this calming and rational remark. It's all too easy to dwell on missed acquisitions or premature sellouts but hindsight is 20/20.
Yeah, I tell myself I would have just kept it until now, but I know me. The second it hit $50 I would have cashed out.
Is the friend rich, or did he cash out at $100?
"I've talked about bitcoin with my friends for years. They're always like ""damn I should have bought in the dip"" and I'm like ""well buy some now, then"" and they go ""naw it's to expensive now, it's gonna crash"". That was at like $32 and then again at $700..."
I sold my only bitcoin at 30 bucks, up from 25. I thought my 5 dollar profit was genius. 
What color is his Lambo?
And I used my Bitcoins to buy fucking 4chan passes.
"Unpopular opinion time:

This is a great opportunity to sell, fellas.

I truly believe in crypto’s future but it won’t happen overnight, it takes time. And these spikes are great opportunities to capitalize on, sell, and rebuy when the price comes down to something more reasonable."
Congratulations! That’s amazing. Made my day. 
They have now done both.  They announced, and now their servers have dropped the signalling.
"You must have invested a metric fuck ton if your cost basis was $2991. Damn!

Also, don't forget to pay your taxes."
No I think 150k is a bit too optimistic.
that would never happen, if it did, people would be buying 100s of coins each
"I was expecting a response like that, and it's not entirely undeserved. It's actually good, because it reminds me to stay away from here, because everybody is angry and agressive and says ""Hodl"" and constantly posts that freaking Bollywood gif.  

Good luck, everyone! Bye for now!"
They still haven’t given bch to their users they will absolutely slow roll your rightful fork coins, make profit off them and only then give you them when they’re useles
question: what's a wall? an order or a bid or something else?
2020 : 1 BTC = 1 house
I don't know, but the guy ate the pizza... didn't hodl it
"Laszlo's transaction wasn't with Papa John's - he got someone on the forums to buy for him with CC, and sent that person BTC. Was effectively an OTC trade.

ETA if you follow the transactions, it seems the buyer has been gradually selling ever since, and still HODLs thousands. Can't tell of course if he didn't sell the whole block to someone else at one point, but somebody is worth >$15m from that trade.

https://blockchain.info/address/17TZNT8CBPzUPDfKTXC25RQHrW6M2q6kRo"
Papa Johns was paid in fiat. The recipient ordered pizza on behalf of the buyer.
Rumor has it some Papa Johns manager backed it up on to a thumb drive and lost it when they renovated the location. 
"If you want a  serious answer, yes: what lit the blue touchpaper was wikileaks (and I believe Ross Ullbricht started the silk road concept shortly after that); *those* are the applications that bootstrapped bitcoin. Paying for a retail tx like those pizzas (which were actually bought with a CC) is just fun, it didn't matter."
"I mean, he could have offered 5,000 btc for the pizza and saved himsself like 29mil.

10000 just seems so arbitrary."
"Best thing about trading currencies - the markets are open almost 24/7.

which 4 am
"> Put your stops in before bed, 4 am is when markets move.

That sounds weird. As there is a Chinese 4 AM, a European 4 AM and an NA 4 AM.

You **really** want to express your timezones in UTC. I mean, it is pretty obvious that you are from NA. So markets move when Europeans wake up but the last American goes to bed?"
You sound confident. Care for a little wager?
Exactly. For example, Coinbase is releasing BCH to customers on Jan 1st. Gemini just released yesterday. 
"I don't believe that bullshit for a second. Lots of people are dead against bitcoin, think it's a scam, and/or just plain do not understand the mechanics of it. There's a lot to understand, starting with ""what is money, actually?""

The last thing we need is flat-earthers, chemtrailers and conspiretards en masse like they have in r/btc now.

You can generate your keys deterministicly from the seed.
My btc is sitting in coinbase right now. What should I do so that I get both sets of coins?
"> Computer was confusing.

> Even my grandma uses it now.

Mobile wallets with ease of use in mind will go a long way for mass adoption."
Like the Federal Reserve is any easier to understand.
"> but you should be able to get ""free 5% extra bitcoin.""

Oh! My understanding was that if you owned 1BTC before the fork then after the fork you would own 1BTC *or* 1BCH.

But really you would own 1BTC *and* 1BCH?! So you could sell 0.5BCH and afterwards you would still own 1BTC + 0.5BCH?

I assumed that selling from one fork would reduce your holdings in the other by the same amount (i.e. selling 0.5BCH would leave you with 0.5BTC + 0.5BCH), so you would have to choose one or the other."
"> Yes, you do!

This very much depends on when the BTC was acquired..."
I very much believe in cryptocurrencies and their future, but these matters are what are holding it back from being adopted into general public. If its so very fucking confusing and hard to grasp for young people and even educated young people, how would anyone believe its possible for, for example my father and the like to start getting into. This will take time, lots of time, but thats a good thing, because in the meantime, I can buy more while I still can. :D
Ok, first off do you use Gemini? I'm not sure why I still have pre-credited deposits when my first transaction was Sept 27 and they say 4-5 business days. 
 Its simple really, take the dinglebop and push it through the grumbo. Where the fleeb is then rubbed against it. Its important that the fleeb is rubbed, because the fleeb has all the fleeb juice.
"Hahahaha we were all new once. 

Gemini is an exchange where you can purchase BTC (bitcoin) and ETH (ethereum). 

You need to use the traditional banking system to purchase bitcoin, they'll also need to verify you which could take a couple of days. 

Once that's done its best to store them in a hardware wallet (such as a Trezor). To keep them secure from hackers. "
My first transaction was Sept 27 and I still can't withdrawal the ETH that I bought that day.
"It still doesn't have any big players on board so far, at least officially. The market cap is tiny - it's at ~1% compared to gold. If it steals just 10% of the gold market - price will increase tenfold. It only recently surpassed the net worth on Bill Gates. Think about it - just one person was still worth more than all of the bitcoin combined.

If any one of the likes of Goldman Sachs will decide to officially enter the market - it will start a chain reaction. I'm not saying it will certainly happen, but if it does - 100k+ is not unreasonable at all."
"You must be new here.

For real though I could see it hitting the $500k range in 5-10 years. I'm not holding my breath but I do believe it could happen."
[deleted]
True. But blame eth not Bitcoin.(I guess you meant ethereum
I do 5% automatically each paycheck using BitWage. Been doing this for the past 2 years. I've made...a bit.
I have almost all that i started with.  95%.  And have already spent more extracted from growth in fiat than i ever put in. 
">  Volatility dissuades people from adopting it as a currency.

In the developed world maybe.

For the other 3/4 of the world's population a volitile currency that is volitile in an upwards direction is a lot more appealing than what they have experienced or are currently experiencing with their own currency."
It basically is a pyramid scheme now. No-one is spending bitcoins because of their price, when no one is spending it on goods or services you're left with people trading it, but trading it for what? There will be nothing to spend it on and the price will crash once people see they're overvalued.
Yea... I was thinking of investing in BTC untill I thought about this pretty hard. No doupt people are making money here, but its from selling to other people buying in, rather than through organic point of sale transaction & inflation
"F.U.C.K.!.

damn "
Sell me your BTC?
You have not. By next year when it's doubled you'll be saying the  same thing. Get in now before you regret it later. (and by now I don't mean this second, but during the next huge dip) 
"No; the round number walls are often quite strong... for entire days."

"Bubbles are pretty much always correctly spotted by economists. 

Financers and the general public are the ones that are oblivious to them and usually belive before the crash that they have found a magical asset that defies every bit of knowledge about prices that we have.

Cryptos are a bubble in the way that their prices have skyrocketed way harder that real state in 2007 or internet companies in 1999. But people will never listen to someone with a negative forecast about their wealth."
Some bubbles are easy to spot if you just factor in the constant bitcoin growth.
"Bitcoin cash fork has set a precedent, it gave people free value while Bitcoin value was not decreased after the fork, basically they were given free $300-$600 for each Bitcoin they owned depending on when and if they sold. 

So the expectation/enthusiasm are much higher this time. Though of course I'm afraid you are correct, forking is actually pretty bad and the success of Bitcoin cash fork probably won't be repeated this time."

"I think it’s Chinese Speculators (trading yuan for yen, check the current spot, Yuan is falling against the yen, meaning they're buying yen, selling yuan), american hedge funds that post no margin, and chinese hedge funds that post no margin (now trading Yuan for Yen), buying up BTC for god knows what reason, plus other speculators who are afraid of missing out. Get your popcorn ready, BTC will be visited by the bear soon. 

Edit: Grammar"

Day trader is a job. Why not day hodler?
I invested $80 into it back when it was $600 per BTC. Totally forgot about it until a couple weeks ago. I'm pleasantly surprised, and at this point wondering if I should put more money into it. 
keep your job to pay the bills so you're not forced out of some satoshis
Interesting. I was just thinking today that if I did drugs I'd own a bunch of bitcoin. I looked at the silk road for a medical thing, but lose interest when I saw it was all recreational so I didn't buy around $20
"> Wallets were too complicated

Fucking this. I remember having a wallet client downloaded on my shitty laptop and the blockchain taking forever to download back in 2011, and I was like fuck this
I bought weed online for 25btc
I 100% would have sold it at 50, and that helps me sleep at night
"Exactly, I knew about BTC when they were in the pennies, I thought they were dumb then and still think they are dumb now.

Had I bought back then I 100% would have sold the second they reached a dollar."
Can i come snuggle under the blankies too, i have chat history of a friend telling me to buy in at $13 :-( 
Maybe when it first hit $200
I cashed out my single bitcoin for a profit of a cool $600
He would have cashed out way earlier.  At 1000% for example. 
Yeah you would have only been a millionaire instead of a multi millionaire
A day for the ages 
Extrinsic value still ads value as a bottom. Bitcoin has no extrinsic value whatsoever.
How exactly do you get the new coin after the fork if you set up a wallet?
[deleted]
Yeah, just gotta pony up and buy some. It’s obviously worth the risk. Just sit on it until it hits a peak in 2 years and you’ll probably be a very happy person. 
"You gotta get out of the bubble first though, since  you just gave $4800 to some random person. Now you gotta sell it higher to another random person!!!

Edit: This is how you make money off speculative bubbles. If I did it super easily, so can other people. "
"No, you can't think of it that way. You've made nearly a grand *when somebody buys your bitcoin off you at the new, higher, price*. Until then, you've lost money.

The value of any currency is only what someone will give you for it. Until you've realised that value, it's safest to assume you'll get nothing. If you start making real-world decisions on the basis of un-sold bitcoins, you could get a very nasty shock if you find you can't realise the value you'd been expecting."
"I once bought around $15 worth of Bitcoin like 2 years ago. Sold it after like 3 days because I needed my money for something else and it felt pointless (also Bitcoin had a major dip then raised back)

I know it isn't much but seeing all the ""BITCOIN IS AT A MILLION DOLLARS"" stuff make me think... should I really get into it?"
"It's a trick to check whether the growth is 

exponential (which just means fixed percentage growth over time) 

versus 

super-exponential (which means it's more likely to be a bubble)."
A constant percentage increase is exponential growth, and on a log graph it will appear as a straight line. Although 10 percent on one day is almost absurd, but as volatile as bitcoin is it isn’t beyond belief. 
There's a derivative already trading on a exchange about the future outcome of the hardfork, basically people betting on what's going to happen. All the bets are overwhelmingly in support of one specific outcome.
People are being given the opportunity to bet on which side of the fork will be the most valuable, and the price of the bt2 token (that will be exchanged for B2X in November) went from .3 to .25 to .20 and now is valued at 0.12 bitcoin. This shows that the community will keep their bitcoins and dump the 2x coin after the fork, so all the uncertainty about the future of Bitcoin has cleared.
Probably not it depends on the exchange, you have to withdraw to your wallet to be sure.
If they finally manage to increase the block size and make the currency cheaper and more efficient to use then it will rally. 
No one knows what it will do after the fork - that's the nature of Bitcoin. 
"Whether there is a slight or large or no drop of BTC after the fork ignores the fact that you'll also own the other coin. So you should factor in their value in addition to BTC's value when considering ""the price"" after the fork.

This is what some people don't think about enough: as long as you HODL all forks, you can't be harmed, and which particular one ""succeeds"" if in aggregate the sum total goes up in value makes the fear of forks irrational.  

I think BTC will win out anyways, but as long as you own pre-fork and HODL for a long time at least until the fork ""winner"" shakes out... you have nothing to worry about. Buying post-fork is another matter though of course in short term choosing BTC would be the logical choice over any fork. My point is... split chains mean you have to add them all up together. That is the price."
Yes but it will take longer as far as I am aware. You don't own any Bitcoin right now, but Coinbase is giving you a promise that they will pay you in the future. No ownership == no new coins
Didn't help with a bunch of big wigs decided to slander the coin so they can buy in themselves. Well, I guess in a way that did kind of help, once it was obvious they were buying in themselves at the lower price a lot of people took that as a sign they should as well.
trezor itself doesnt give you the actual private keys afaik, they are encrypted in the device? but check r/trezor 
[deleted]
"You're exposed to many more risks of never actually keeping possession of that BTC since you literally do not possess it. You have control of an account login that enables you to *transfer* the BTC into your possession, but you don't actually have it. 

Aside from all of the implications of that (my biggest concern being regulatory risk of exchanges getting shut down.. which we see all the time) and hacking, which we see all the time... there is the clear risk of not having control of pre-fork coins (which we saw affect Coinbase and others regarding BCash. Coinbase customers *right now* do NOT have access to their BCash. Understand why?).

If you don't completely and fully understand why coins on an exchange are not the same as *owning Bitcoin*, then you need to do more research. It is fundamental to understanding Bitcoin itself. Owning bitcoin = control of keys. 

Trezor is very solid, easy to use hardware wallet if you're looking for one.."
The difference is that if you have BTC in coinbase you don't really have BTC, coinbase controls it and you won't receive the new coin after the fork at least not until coinbase decides to credit you the new coin which is not a sure thing either. If you have bitcoin on your hardware key you really own it and you'll receive the new coin instantly.
You should contact the group that wrote the wallet software to find out their policy on Bitcoin cash. It was different for every wallet. Also, consider a fork as an update to software. You're prompted to download the latest software that you have on your computer. This is similar, it's just that the developers handle it, and it is usually meant to improve the technology. Another two forks are upcoming, and to know how your wallet will relinquish the new bitcoin gold for instance, you simply have to check with them. I had my bitcoin in a jaxx wallet during the Bitcoin cash fork, and they are just now about to release it from what they say on the latest blog post.
"> Im very confused

The basis for a stable and useful currency LUL"
"> Do i have some bitcoin cash somehow

Yes, you do! I'm also not very bitcoin savvy, but I discovered this a few weeks after the fork. In my case, I had my BTC in a Multibit wallet and needed to move them anyway (since the wallet was discontinued). But if you google ""mycelium bitcoin cash"", you will see a few sites where they explain how to claim your BCH. BCH price is declining, but you should be able to get ""free 5% extra bitcoin.""

EDIT: as u/pkop pointed out, you only have bitcoin cash for the bitcoin you bought before the fork. (i.e. before Aug. 1, somebody correct me if I got that wrong too)."
"You *are* confused. I'm not even sure where to start explaining.

In the meantime: Setup your hardwallet. Transfer your money from Gemini to the hardwallet.

"
Wtf are these words
Gemini takes about five days for each deposit to clear. Right now you are paying with credit. 
Isn’t that claim...A tad bit out there?
Tbh it's a nice keyboard.
~~Electrum~~ Ethereum, however, is.
Short it then. There are many crypto exchanges like poloniex that allow you to short bitcoin. You can even do it using leveraged positions. Good luck!
How many did you start with and how many have you kept?

"And it's not only that that some ""don't get it"" but that some get it perfectly fine but their livelihood and incentives lead them to be 100% against Bitcoin (Jamie Dimon, bankers etc.) and want to see it fail.

There is mix of many who don't understand it and also want to see it fail as well. These people are probably the most dangerous because many of them involved in politics or government or banking will see themselves as heroes looking out for the avg citizen when they attack BTC

You can do this through some type of contract. I'm not too familiar with where though. 
"Yes. Bitfinex allows shorting for about 10 major coins, and it also allows margin trading 3 to 1.

Also, as the other guy said, be very careful here. Even with a surety like Bitcoin Cash or Ethereum Classic, both of which have no real use anymore, the Asian countries have a lot more shorting and leveraged options than we do. When a price looks good, they make their moves, and you can lose a lot of money by shorting something which by all means, has no right to be a billion dollar coin."

">I sense a great disturbance in the blockchain. As if thousands of bitcoins suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced.

To be clearer they put 'sell orders' at a certain price, thus creating a wall. 
"I dont do bitcoin, but from what I understand is that they put up lets say 1000 bitcoins at a lower than market price. 

This forces anyone else who wants to sell this day to sell below that price because of the ""wall"" of cheap bitcoins. 

This allows the people who put the wall up to buy from the people who have to go lower than their wall, they hope to make a profit by buying more bitcoins under market value before people buy their entire wall."

Not all technical analysis is bad. Time will tell."
Do you think some regulation might help with this?
I'm about four years into my 11 year plan.  It took me about a year to get my head fully around it.
RemindMe! 861 days
"That's a moot point. 

First of all, if Bitcoin replaces money - yearly growth will be less than 5%, since without new people getting into it the value can only grow with the economy/population growth. 

Even if you imagine crazy growth like x10 every year - it is only applicable if you have something else to spend. It is regrettable to see that pizza costed a million dollars not because Bitcoin increased in value, but because dollar didn't. You were left with something that stayed the same, while something else became valuable. And it's easy to see this on the example.

let's say it's year 0, Bitcoin is worth 1$ and price is multiplying tenfold every year. 
let's say you have $100 dollars to your name and you buy $10 pizza every year.

Now in your case you have let's say 20% of your worth in bitcoin, so 20 BTC and 80$. 
If you decide to pay for pizza in Bitcoin your balance will look like that:

* Year 0 - 10 BTC + $80 (10$ 10 BTC pizza)
* Year 1 - 9 BTC + $80 (10$ 1 BTC pizza)
* Year 2 - 8.9 BTC + $80 (10$ 0.1 BTC pizza)
* Year 3 - 8.89 BTC + $80 (10$ 0.01 BTC pizza)

So now your balance is equivalent of $8 890 + $80. If you think back you see that you could have saved 20 BTC and payed in cash, and you would have $20 000 +  $40. That's your point - why would anyone spend BTC then?

BUT if you get rid of cash equivalent and only have 100 BTC. 
Your balance will look like that:

* Year 0 - 90 BTC (10$ 10 BTC pizza)
* Year 1 - 89 BTC (10$ 1 BTC pizza)
* Year 2 - 88.9 BTC (10$ 0.1 BTC pizza)
* Year 3 - 88.89 BTC (10$ 0.01 BTC pizza)

So now your balance is equivalent of $88 890. And now you could think that you could have $100 000 if you didn't buy the pizza in year 0, but now it's completely irrelevant since you payed for the goods you wanted at the appropriate price at the time and there's no alternative way to buy it cheaper.


 
"
Store of value then. 
"Perfectly reasonable point. And I always urge people to not try to time the market for that reason - you have no idea what it’s going to do and you will more than likely lose out.

I don’t see this as timing the market though. 

I sold last night when it was ~$5,700 on Coinbase. Whether it goes all the way up to $6,000 or even $7,000 isn’t a concern for me. It shot up 20% in a single day to an all time high and those were perfectly adequate returns for me to feel comfortable cashing out at (for now).

If it goes to $7,500 tomorrow I will see it as clearly overvalued and will need to reassess my position before choosing when and where to buy back in at."

Urgh. Technical analysts applying ...patterns from an entirely different beast. I have to look through my old messages and taunt them soon. 
Gemini doesn't release any transactions until all deposits have cleared. You could take a 5 business day break if you'd like to withdraw all of those coins pre-fork.
gemini loves to slowroll ach deposits :(
yeah that’s how i feel about it now. So hopefully i can get a decent amount in it and just let that baby cook for a couple of years. 
"That's certainly true and if you look at historical prices of gold over the last century it's been through several booms and busts.

If there suddenly became a way to synthetically create gold for less then it's market price you'd watch the market price come down to meet the manufacturing price.

Gold of course has a slightly special relationship on account of it being used for long periods of time throughout history as a store of wealth, but that doesn't make it impervious to market forces."

But what if you sell at 5500, then it peaks at 7500 and bottoms out at 6000? We can reasonably predict the overall pattern but nobody knows at what price point each movement will occur, and trying to guess without seriously good reasoning is a fool's game.
What if it is actually lost and some clueless intern found it and reformatted it to use it himself?
Welp, time to start buying pizzas in DOGE.
Ho-leeey-fuck that guy must be crying on a daily basis now...hot damn

It when someone sells a lot of Btc at once, thus creating a wall. Everyone else now has to sell below that wall. This allows people with enough btc to manipulate prices by lowering the wall until they are happy with the price. Now they buy all the cheap btc and remove the wall once they’re done.

Bubbles are easy to spot. Figuring out when it's going to pop is the tricky part.
"10% in one day?

Hmmm. I think most economist would have a clear opinion on this one."
Yeah and now bitcoin cash is in a perpetual decline. So much for 'free money'. B
Alt coins also crashed during this period. A lot of people probably banking on the same thing happening, bitcoin goes up, alts go down and free coins. Bam easily increase your overall holdings(assuming you time the market correctly/dont get greedy)

You are talking about hard forks, big difference. Also still not true regardless, hard forks should be treated on a case to case basis, you can't generelize it like that."
Good for the long term, we gotta get thru this 'forks are free money' phase, poor schmucks are getting robbed buying the forks. All part of the maturation of the tech.
Preach! 
That's how a commodity works, not a currency. I can spend my Bitcoin.  You would never discuss dollars like this. Currencies are fully liquid at any moment, not needing a buyer. 
Don't people just sell it on Coinbase or other exchanges?  Doesn't seem that hard to do.  
Yep, that's why I consider myself to have $0 in retirement savings despite my annual 401k contributions.
story of my life
"I was trying to talk my friends in 2010 to invest $500 each and they all said no so I didn't.

People here like to say I would be a billionaire having money fights with Bill Gates but the fact of the matter is you wouldn't have.

Other online friends all cashed out when their investment hit $200 per coin and most of the millionaires you hear about now literally forgot they even owned coins and just had a nice surprise when they found out they had some.

If you would have followed the history of bitcoins, many times sites closed and took your coins and many didn't get refunds.  People were hacked if they kept their coins not secure on their computers as well which made it an annoyance as well.

I felt that if I would have invested in BTC back then, I would have lost the coins up until the point they became worth what they are today.  I mean hell, the drive I would have kept them on doesn't even work anymore.

As for getting into it now, it is a gamble and I'd suggest maxing out other retirement accounts prior to investing into BTC.  It might not be a popular opinion here but max that stuff out and then invest in BTC if you have funds left to invest."

If you think a bubble happens in a single day, I also have a clear opinion of that.
I agree I definitely thought bch was gonna crash right out the gate , its one saving grace was there was artificial scarcity caused by locked coins in exchanges coupled with a unique altcoin launch. Eventually this method will be debased 
"As I replied to another post above:

How do you propose to live off it when currently no bank will accept it for mortgage repayments, virtually no landlord will accept it for rent, no state will accept it for payment of tax liabilities and virtually no employers will honour a request for payment in it (and cannot, if they operate a PAYE payroll). 

In short, unless you own your own home outright, are self-employed and have clients willing to pay you in bitcoin, and are able to buy all your required goods and services via bitcoin - then you are subject to the volatility of the bitcoin market in a way that USD, GBP and EUR aren't. 

For as long as you have to exchange bitcoin back to local currency in order to realise its value then by default, you are subject to the risk that the value of your BTC will be much lower than what you paid for them.

Of course that's no different the risk that my pound sterling may be devalued by a hard Brexit, say - but at least when that happens, my bank, my landlord, my creditors, my debtors are all experiencing the same devaluation, at the same rate, in the same way. The relative purchasing power of our pounds will all be the same. Any bitcoins I have may or may not have - and that's where there's risk.

It's not an unmanageable risk, but people shouldn't be duped into ignoring it."

After the fork, they will be diferent currency. If you hold bitcoin before the fork, the validation of your bitcoin in the chain will be on both sides.

You don't think that the people who were shitting on the dot com boom we're doing it so that they could get great domain names, do you? "
Coinbase released a statement on their blog, that they will offer you a way to access both coins. This applies for the S2X fork, not for the BTG fork do far 
When will the Federal Reserve finally fork the US dollar?
">  I have a bunch of coin (BTC and ETH) in Gemini.

What is a ""pre-cred..."" - i looked it up.

Reads like Gemini will give you the balance of your deposit before it clears, if you are a top bloke. You must be a top bloke.

So, you can buy crypto with that money. Now. Or have you already?

If not, then: Setup trezor. Buy crypto on Gemini. Transfer crypto to trezor."

God damnit am I jealous of you... i remember seeing bitcoin cards for like $10 a pop when i was like 14.... that was 6 years ago, i wish i understood then what i do now... I could have bought those with my allowance and have millions now... it’s a hard knock life... 
where in the undeveloped world will people be able to use bitcoin as a currency?
How people don't see this as a zero sum game is beyond me. As if the market would hold the current price if everyone tried to sell out of it
The littlest. 
Seems like 4am PST. It's was around that time a few weeks ago it briefly fell below $3k. Sadly, I was still sleep. 😭
A sodler. Lol
"Again, it won’t bother me. I see it as letting go of an overvalued asset at a time that was great to sell; not because that’s as high as it could have possibly went but because that was higher than what I thought was a fair evaluation for it and a price that gained me adequate returns. 

All because there was no major reason for this spike. If say, it was announced earlier yesterday that every retailer in America would accept Bitcoin as payment I would hold that shit until my dying days, buy more at $6,000 and $7,500 and $10,000. I wouldn’t see it as overvalued anymore given some massive news like that.

But that wasn’t the case.That’s why I see it as overvalued right now."
10k to 8k? You dont know your bitcoin history. More like 10k to 5k or 6k
"As a long time digital currency trader, this is pretty much exactly how it works. 10k is a psychological barrier. You hit 10.5, you're gonna rally to 15 because all of that hesitancy is building up... you break it the fear goes away and the money comes flying in and then all the rest as people try to ride the wave.

Downside about currency trading is the sleep you lose because you keep yourself constantly notified of any changes that happen as you sleep too lol"
"If you look at it over a year on a log chart, it's pretty much moving in a straight line which seems to indicate this is just organic growth with occasional temporary reversals caused by FUD.

A 10% increase from $50 to $55 feels much smaller than $5000 to $5500 but it's just the same."
I think it's not the hard fork, it's the realisation that the fork will fail, following the tanking of the futures at Bitfinex
People want to get in before the hard fork. If you have Bitcoin, and you own your private keys, you get the same amount of coin in the new fork.
the end is near...
Can't wait for it to fall hard again
I feel like it's gone up so much it's not even worth buying in at this point because I'm just going to regret not buying in when I should have in January.
Right now I have my bitcoins in Coinbase. How can I get both coins after the fork?

"Earlier today (~5k) mates were questioning whether btc would hit 6k before year's end. 

A few hours later it was 5.8k and we realised it might hit 6k before day's end :P"
Such an interesting trend and I don't understand it. Bitcoin has been rallying up within days, only to die out and go down, and then there's another rally setting the new high, dying out and slow sell off, boom, another rally for a new high, continue until?
what goes up...must go UP leskooo
The eventual crash will be epic. Remember you can declare bankruptcy, don't suicide.
Can it just hurry and hit $500,000 like John McAfee said it would. I want to fuck hot babes and drive Lambos.

We all know in about 2 weeks time this is going to fizzle out back down to around $3400. Which at that time we all will buy more, and the ones that don't will complain they should've bought more. One or two people will complain they went all in at $5900, and then it'll rise back up and break $6k before we know it. Rinse and repeat. 
Fucking kill me right the fuck now. In 2012 i bought a mechanical keyboard for like 40btc. 40. Fucking. Bitcoin. I had like 200 at one point. I was saving for a new Gpu so I could mine twice as many.

It's rising independently of DOGE as well so I don't think it's anything to get excited about
"im sure there are a confluence of factors but this recent increase coincides with trends in bitcoin to have an inflationary period followed by profit taking.

i predict this current period of valuation increase will take us to 10k in 2 weeks and then follow by profit taking to 8k or so. this will be a 2 month cycle, which after that round of profit taking will accelerate to 20k by March 18 before profit taking to 15k"
bingo.
Hindsight is bullshit. If you bought at $1 selling at $2, $10, $100 etc was the normal thing to do psychologically, you can't predict the future and back then it was still a small experiment.

You’re not the only one to miss that once in a lifetime opportunity... you’re just aware of the fact, which will haunt you for the rest of your life. I’m with you brother or sister 
If it makes you feel any better, you would've cashed out when it spiked to 1230 in December 2013.
Just put another 2k into it! It dipped for a second!
"Un-fucking-real.

I have my app set to alert me when there’s a change >10% and today it got set off... twice..."
I hope you’re actually cashing out 
 congratulations. 
no, it will hit 9950 and run into profit taking that takes it down to 8k or so, where it will sit before the next rally to 16k
Why would you ever sell them?!
"I sold at $4800 at 9:00 AM (Eastern Time) on Wednesday (10/11). I figured with all the commotion over the fork, there wouldn't be much change for awhile, and hopefully even a dip. Plus, I was getting very obsessive about watching the price.  

Less than 24 hours later, the price exploded higher than ever. It sucks a bunch, but I'm trying not to get too bummed out about it. I had <1 BTC, so it's not like I missed out on millions, and at least made some money, but it still sucks.

I just bought a little bit at 5,500 a couple hours ago.  And I've been obsessively watching the price since yesterday morning."
I wanna say China and the altcoin market consolidating on Bitcoin, people in China are buying back in on news that China will regulate exchanges

"Someone explain this to me.

If one person held all the bitcoins in the world, it would be useless because it has no value. You could have all the [meme]coins ever invented, if you are the only person who trades it, it becomes meaningless since no other person can get any return out of it.

Things that are artificially made/sourced in a market without fair competition have value because of the demand for them. How scarce it is is explicitly NOT a factor. Diamonds are not rare at all, there is just a high demand for them and maximum profits are obtained at selling at a high price (prices are absolutely not subject to competition and demand).

The question I want to ask people, is why is demand for bitcoin so high? Who are the people out there paying for it? Is it as I fear, and the people who have the highest demand for it, are actually bitcoin miners themselves, thus in a feedback loop? If this is actually the case, I think there is a serious problem and bitcoin is 100% in a bubble. If you have a scheme where new entrants pay real money to get some [meme]coin and the only way to increase your share of [meme]coin is by encouraging other new entrants to pay more money to increase the value of your [meme]coin, this goes right the way to the top where the overall owner is filthy rich.

I'm making some stretches there but the points I make about who is dragging the price up has to be addressed and the answer absolutely can not be 'supply and demand' because supply is 100% not involved here (there are no competing sources), the demand is."

"Wait, what? Im sorry, i know very little about BTC.  I have about .104BTC I got from gambling and withdrew $400 worth about a month ago.  I have this all sitting in an exchange, should I move it over to a wallet?

Noob question, having trouble finding information related to it-- if my coins are on an exchange, do I still get my match of BTGold?
Excuse my lack of understanding but I thought it would drop after the fork ? I’ve been very indecisive about buying lol and I’m not sure if I should buy now or wait for the fork. Anything I can read up on so I improve my chances. Thanks 
Will I get some of the new coin if I leave my BTC in Coinbase/GDAX? Sorry noob here. 
"That and it has been trying to break through $5k for a while now. Third time is the charm.

Once it's above $5k the psychological barrier is broken, excitement builds and momentum carries it even further.

The antithesis of this is when it got to ~$4950 a few weeks back, hit a wall of profit taking and resistance, and dropped like a stone."
Do you automatically get the private keys once you move bitcoin from the exchange to a hardware wallet like trezor? How do you get the new coin after the fork?
What if it's a massive pump running on tether that's only playing off the S2X hype?  Nobody on Reddit seems even a little excited for S2X.  Not like BCC.  Why does every spike start on finex?  Imagine how much bitcoin they would make if they trigger  a dip at some point and liquate fomo margin positions. 
Let's assume I had x = 1 BTC in a website such as Coinbase. What would be the difference keeping it there or keeping it on my own hardware key? Would I get anything extra and how?
"Im very confused by these fork stuffs. Im very new into bitcoin, been bying some from every paycheck and have a mycelium wallet ive been transferring them to. Do i have some bitcoin cash somehow, and what is this new coin stuff. How do i get to sell them off and but more, and do i have to do anything to prepare for these forks news, when i control my keys.
"
I'm still confused about this fork. I have a bunch of coin (BTC and ETH) in Gemini. I just emailed them because I have a Trezor and none of my bank transactions have cleared yet for some reason so I can't withdrawal any of my crypto yet. Is it important to get everything into my hard wallet before this fork?
I don't invest personal emotion in other peoples failure.  But that's just me.

I imagine it's great for all sorts of shady enterprises, though. Dark net transactions, tax loopholes, currency manipulation/hedging, etc...

Also, they have marketed it very well. Powered by people who get to ""earn money"" by ""running a program in the background of their computer"" (the reason why the market is as big as it is, that sentence tends to draw in a lot of kids/moneygrubbers)

If you're not in already, I'd be careful stepping in to the daytime trading arena. If you are in, best of luck at jumping ship at the most profitable point in time, and *before* any crash, where it becomes near impossible to sell."
Go look at the blockchain yourself, it's open for everyone if you're so curious
Bitcoin's in high demand because it's the first asset in human history to possess all the properties that define good money: scarcity (by definition), portability (absolute), divisibility (to eight decimal points), durability (for as long as the last copy of the blockchain still exists somewhere on some medium), and fungibility (well, fungibility isn't ideal yet: for that Bitcoin needs to be anonymous--but developers are working on that).
if someone had all the normal currency in the world it'd also be worth nothing...all currencies are arbitrarily given value

Care to explain the second part for a noob?
Until it crashes. Rule #1, don't buy what you can't afford to lose.
True. But the 24 hour growth has still been pretty drastic today compared to from when I started following. 
What? Why would you look at it on a log chart to say it's increasing in a straight line?  Are you trying to trick yourself into believing it's not a bubble?
cause in one month it will be worth 150 lol
because this whole deal is a house of cards and he decided to get out at a time he felt was safe, which seeing as how things are going I can't blame him
you are doing it wrong. idiot. I allow myself to call you an idiot so you learn. HODL!!! never sell in a bull market and buy dips.
The greater good!
No bitfinex is Not a wallet and neither is GDAX those are exchanges and you are not guaranteed to get the new coin if you store bitcoin with them. Get a real wallet from bitcoin.org and store your bitcoin there.
Don't know, but remember reading you can presell on bitfinex.
GDAX/Coinbase stated they will support both BTC AND B2X.
ahah yeah, bitfinex had a 1200 wall that got eaten pretty fast
Jesus. That dude is probably sitting on the ledge, eating the last of his garlic sauce before he jumps. 
hindsight is always 20/20. plus he did it for a little lulz also. it was a good deal back then.

Anyone know what they did with the BTC? Did they hodl?
Can't forget to get some sodie pops.
That purchase set precedence and btc was given value. Without the pizza purchase does btc become what it is today? Serious question
History in the making is why I follow r/Bitcoin. Got my popcorn ready
That's what they called it at $200, $500, $1000, $2,000, $3,000, $4000, and $5,000 too. At what point is it no longer a bubble? 
every world currency is a bubble
The fiat currency bubble is bursting.

"A ""speculative bubble"" to be precise!"
"What happens when everyone realizes their ""free coins"" don't mean shit, and that these forks aren't a good thing?"
I bought on Wednesday night at 4800, crazy how I almost made a grand since then already. Just wow. 
"Real answer right here
"
Shouldn’t it drop to around 5k - previous ATH? Although they would need to spread some major “panic story” for people to sell that much 
You probably weren’t here during last couple crashes, let me adjust your predictions: 10k will drop to 1500 over long period of stagnation(year or two) hovering around 3-4k followed by another boom cycle to 100k.
Good theory I was planning on profit taking at 7.5 k since thats my total in right now. May wait for the 10k correction and if it doesn't correct and moons I'll still be happy
Its all hype right now. Same thing happened end of 2012
Linear on log chart is exponential growth. It is not natural for such short time spans.
"What are 5,500,000$ when you have love, health and family?


They are exactly 5,500,000$. Let it sink in."
Yep they're also about to install Kim Jong Un as Bitcoin CEO.
100 its a bubble 200 its a bubble 300 its a bubble 400 its a bubble 500 its a bubble 600 its a bubble 700 its a bubble 800 its a bubble 900 its a bubble 1000 its a bubble...
"You've got about another month till the 2x fork.

Yes it's easy to transfer from coinbase.

If you've purchased a ledger wallet be sure to initiate it on as safe a computer as you can find. My Nano S is finally arriving today also!"
Make sure you test your wallet first do you know how to use it correctly and confidently. Send a small amount first and the the backup/restore procedure. Once done you can transfer your actual coins. 
Are you talking about getting forked coins? Because that doesn't need a hardware wallet. Just a wallet where you control the keys.

I'm sure john has mixed feelings. 
With f2pool formally dropping out of the nya the bitcoin blockchain will continue on regardless of what the nya attackers do.  They're falling apart, and the market is reacting.

Nah, man, this is scary volatile.
There is absolutely no reason whatsoever to think like this. “I almost bought apple stock”, “I almost bought stock right when the market was at the lowest in 2009” etc.
"Same, but for me it was in 2014 after the crash and bitcoin was at $200. I had about $2k to throw on either a new computer rig or bitcoin. Thing was, in 2014 the method of actually buying bitcoin was too complicated for my tastes (if I could simply pay with paypal at the time I would have bought with two-clicks) so I said fuck it and bought the computer rig.

Now I'm regretting my laziness. I could have bought several new computer rigs with that investment now...

BTW, has methods of buying bitcoin gotten easier? "
That's how I feel about departing with an old harddrive with hundreds of BTC on it. I want to vomit when I think about it, but it's long gone. It makes me wonder how much BTC is forever lost like that...
"If it makes you feel better, I was actually buying and mining btc when it was $5-7, but I was only buying to turn around and spend it on drugs online. I got my money's worth (and then some as it jumped to $13-15), and it may not have taken off as well without people actually spending coins, but I still don't like to think about the number of coins that passed through my hands.

Though, if I had invested in some to keep back then, I'd have sold them off LONG before now. I'd have probably sold enough to recover my buy-in when it broke $50, and would've liquidated after the crash from $260-ish back down to $50-ish."
Let’s be honest, you would have panicked and sold at the very first crash. Because you didn’t have the confidence to buy in
"I bought bitcoin and had 1/2 of it disappear by a company that still exists... twice.

I could have gpu mined with multiple computers, or bought at 1, 10, 100.

Welcome.
"
Good find. 
"When its at 28000 you will come and say ""should've bought at 5000""."
If you really don't know how to search the internet on how to buy BTC in 5 years then I don't know what to tell you.
[relevant](https://memes1.fjcdn.com/pictures/Learn+how+to+buy+bitcoin+found+on+httpswwwredditcomrbitcoin_1c3d41_6291325.jpg)
Remember the dot-com bubble? The projects that work will survive. Focus on alts that fill a useful niche, like BAT, or IOTA, or Monero. Hell, Ethereum on its own is really nifty.
"imho it's simply not an investment for the common people yet. 

First we need to reach significant market cap, which is a proxy for trust and adoption / ubiquity even. Then volatility should go down as it always does with established securities."
"It's essentially a high-risk high-reward investment at the moment, not really a currency, despite what people would have you believe.

If one day BTC or some other crypto becomes mainstream enough to actually be a viable sort of global currency, the stability will surely follow as it's value will become more concrete.  Right now the value is driven by demand for the BTC itself, when it becomes a viable currency the value will be driven by the things you can buy with it."
That's pretty typical. 
"I've said that before, ""I'll buy when it dips under 3000"" then it dips, and I say ""what if there's a real problem? Maybe the rally is over and it's just going to keep falling!"" And then I didn't buy."
As a guy who actually did start in earnest four years ago O_o
I wish Bitcoin just stayed at $1000 forever so I can actually use this coin as a god damned currency. This coin is so volatile it's lost it's original purpose

"> Now you can't buy shit with it because its too volatile

Lol, bitcoin is probably less volatile now than it's ever been in its history. And yes, that's AFTER factoring in a 400% increase in the last six months.

If bitcoin was going to ""fail"" for any of the reasons you've listed, it would already have failed years ago."
"> frictionless form of exchange

No, an uncensorable form of exchange. "
I can't wait to sell when it's a $500k bubble.
"5730 already! 

"
"> wasn't bitcoins value in being a frictionless form of exchange for goods and services on the internet. 

That was certainly part of the original vision.  Also a store of value.  Today, it has also become the reserve currency for all other cryptocurrencies.  But I believe its current value is mostly due to people realizing the huge potential of decentralized currencies in general, and bitcoin being the market leader and backbone.  Consider being an early investor in Apple, Amazon or Google.  Let's say 15-20 years ago.  Companies with a big vision and lots of potential, but also the potential to fail spectacularly and lose your money.  Does Bitcoin have issues with scalability, regulation, governance, and usability today?  Yes.  Are those unsolvable problems that fundamentally doom cyrptocurrencies and can never be fixed no matter how many smart people throw billions of dollars at them over the next few decades?  History suggests such problems get solved rather quickly once the technology is there. 

> commissions for its conversion to FIAT are destroying it as form of remittance.

Something like Ripple (XRP) is far better suited to the remittance market.  Just like there are many other currencies coming out that are better suited to specific tasks.  But with each new niche coin that comes out, BTC just seems to get stronger because it is the backbone of this whole new economy."
 Like any investment it is important to understand what you are putting money into.  In practical terms bitcoin is still tiny.  I believe it will become much larger than what it is today.  But i would never recommend getting into it before you understand what it is.  It is extremely unforgiving.
Pssh. Bitcoin is for rookies. Real investors go all in on scratchcards.
"I spent the last 10 years LOLing at bitcoin because it's weirdo libertarian gambling Chuck-E-Cheese tokens.

That said, I decided to buy BitCoins yesterday and bought some today. Getting in is incredibly easy, and if I lose my $25 a week, whoop-de-doo, I used to spend way more than that on smoking which was a far dumber investment."
Why do you say that? I think a lot of it is cash going into BTC to take advantage of BTG.
Hodl the door! 
Aren't hodlers only rewarded if they sell on an ATH ? If you dont sell, you are not rewarded.
Not really. BTC is not like stock you can’t use directly to buy stuff. BTC is a currency itself, so you don’t need to sell to realize gains. It’s like saying to a forex trader you have no gains until you sell your swiss franks. When you hold BTC you already realized the gains. 
wish so i wanna invest big
its gonna crash to 4500! Oh Noooooooooo......
A lot of people with their fingers crossed hoping for this. Might end up crashing to 6k from 8k...
