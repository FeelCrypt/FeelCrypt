"You're blaming Reagan for the homeless problem? lol  BTW, you didn't show that housing them is cheaper just because you linked some studies, because any organization can cherry pick stats and guide their conclusion.  I bet your next liberal thesis will be that our current welfare system is also cheaper, and fiscally and morally successful, after all, RAND has helped shaped that policy as well in the 60s.  Progress? 

The Personal Responsibility argument has historical proof, even YOU are a product of it.  It's called survival and it exists in third world to first world countries.  I support helping the incapable homeless, but they are not the majority that are capable and are in their predicament because of self-inflicted abuses and poor life choices.  There's usually a story behind every capable homeless person and why they've been abandoned by society, their former employers, and even their own family members.  I'm sure they were given ample opportunities and chances to change their behavior, but did not.  There are also so many examples of people born into poverty that took advantage of public schooling and live a respectable life and contribute to society.  They had initiative, pride, and grit... a human resource that is in abundance if you have the motivation to look for it.

You're being an enabler to a social problem and your solution has long-term negative effects, but hey, let's blame Reagan."
"You misinterpreted what I meant if you took it as generalizing the entire middle class. There are definitely *certain* individuals out there (not saying you, or 100% of a group) who behave as though, and will not have a problem telling the world, that they HATE homeless. And THAT is a crazy ass generalization, because even I hate certain homeless in my own demographic, but those of us ""good eggs"" that see broken things and fix them, protect others from being victimized whenever possible, and just being overall considerate people despite the unmitigated hell we live day in and day out. That is all I'm saying. I understand your views, it's a pretty common outlook, not knocking you it's totally understandable and not offensive to me. Good on ya!"
"So, having been shown that housing them is cheaper - you decide money doesn't matter and take a pseudo-moral position?  Do you want to save money or not?

Apart from that, your argument is bullshit.  People can already get a tent and live under a bridge if they are inclined that way.  So why don't they?  ""Why work when you can just panhandle and get high by the river?""  That's where your argument leads.  But most people don't take that path.

Most people are not happy with crumbs.  Nobody who can work just decides to give it up because they're not gonna starve.  Most people want more.  This has been shown in the [basic income experiments](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/01/one-year-on-finland-universal-basic-income-experiment.html).  Despite having basic income, the recipients still pursued vocations.

It also glosses over the reality of the people who are homeless.  A lot of them are simply not equipped to work. They aren't wired to.  Many of them are mentally ill (and were put on the street by Reagan) and should be institutionalized.  That we don't take care of them as a society is barbaric and shameful.  The ""personal responsibility"" argument is crap.

You claim historical proof when there is none, but discard peer reviewed studies because they don't fit your preconceptions.

I'm done, troll."
Iâ€™d watch those.
