"""Don't invest more than you're willing to lose.""

And

""I'm only telling you what my strategy is.""

Those two combined it's just like if they lost money so did I so I'm not gonna feel too bad. Maybe we can commiserate or something."

"**Coinye**

Coinye, formerly Coinye West, is an abandoned scrypt-based cryptocurrency that became embroiled in a trademark infringement lawsuit for using the likeness of American hip hop artist Kanye West as its mascot, despite West having no affiliation with the project. The project was abandoned by the original developers following West's filing of a trademark infringement lawsuit against them.

Always have humility.
So true! I end it with 'I don't know though, it's only my opinion' 
We’re like 17% of the way.
I tell people that it will either x10 or go to zero, no one knows but I can’t afford not to take that bet in case moon 
"I usually end with ""but idk, I ain't shit"""
"Someone took out his life savings to invest in coins. It got stolen off a Ledger Nano he bought on eBay.

Update: Sorry folks, I put in a *Trezor* mistakenly. It's actually a Ledger Nano.

I’m like “it’s your money though so do whatever you feel is right”
When can I invest in the KanyeCoin?
"I didn't even tell my parents about what I have going on with BTC and other crypto. I'd love for them to invest but it would be a headache overall.
"
"In a disclaimer voice I say, ""Your results may vary, past performance is not indicative of future results""."
Gotta throw in the caveats.  I cannot believe people were taking out second mortgages to buy BTC in 2017.
