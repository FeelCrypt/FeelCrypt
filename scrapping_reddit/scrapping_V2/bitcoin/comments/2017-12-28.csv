Yeah but litecoin has a shitty name. It never would have caught on without bitcoin to ride on.

"Very true. Think about it, everyone saying to sell now at $15k and walk away with $25M might be pennies compared to holding for 2 more years if it hits $50k. Then again it could drop to $1k. 

It's always easy to look back and say ""if only I held until this date"". There's a lot of investments that looked promising at the time but ended up flopping. "
Essentially some big market players were able to buy a 1000 btc without moving the price up on themselves. Big bulk buyers wait for bulk sellers to make an exchange.
If you look at the numbers on the left hand side, those are open orders. The ones in red are people selling BTC and those in green are those purchasing it. You'll notice when the video starts that there's a large block of open orders for ~1,000 BTC for $17,250.00, whereas the bulk of orders are looking to purchase BTC at $17,249.97 - $17,249.99. The numbers scrolling down on the right under Trade History are trades that are going through on the exchange. You'll see that these are all being processed at just below $17,250.00 at the beginning of the video. The chart in the middle shows where the price is and how much demand there is to buy BTC (green) or sell BTC (red) at a specific price. At ~1:30, the price finally moves above $17,250.00 and all of those orders to sell go through. In last 30 seconds the price runs up to $17,449.99.
More likely a house with a fixed rate mortgage with lower interest than what you'd make from a conservative investment.  That usually ends up being a better ROI than using the money to pay off the house.
The dining room chairs I bought directly with bitcoins in like 2015 are now worth more than my cars and motorcycles combined :(
Exactly. Hindsight looks great. But 99.999999% of people are cashing out after a double or triple. Certainly after 5-10x return.  Imagine being up 10k on that “investment” and thinking, nah, I’ll hold on for more. No. Fucking. Way.
"$25 million would be amazing.

But a paid off house today is probably a better idea."
Haha I'm glad I'm not the only one. It's pretty mesmerising just watching those numbers fly around so quickly. Knowing that in seconds there's more money and crypto being trading in front of my eyes than I'll ever own.
Fuck that, with $25 million I could live off 1% ROI a year comfortably in an apartment anywhere. Sign a year lease, at the end of the lease move somewhere else and sign a new lease. Get to travel and really experience each place. Then after like 20 more years I might settle down in one place. 
"My crypto squad has come to the goal of going 50% btc, 50% alt coins. Also regarding any given coin, we only trade 20% of our holdings. Hodl the other 80%. 
 
This allows you to get your feet wet and ride the waves, hopefully generate modest profits. In the event that your coin goes to the moon and you miss your opportunity to buy back what youve sold, you have the peace of mind knowing that 80% of your holdings is going to the moon too."

"I bought some bikes too back when btc was 2-4k.

Back when it was about $350 I spent a bitcoin on an Xbox that I have very rarely use. 

I am willing to make someone a great deal on it, half price, only 0.5 btc. I will even throw in Assassins' Creed and GTA.  "

"Reasonable top is what we've already seen, and a reasonable bottom is $0 as bitcoin will be regulated and made useless if it ever becomes too large a thorn in the government's side. 

Willing to bet we see cryptocurrency regulation in 2018. People are being conned by thinking they're investing in stocks of some sort, but that isn't the case. There's nothing that seems to determine the price of a coin other than what someone can be convinced to pay for it. People are going to be really pissed when they lose their money/enter into debt because they got reckless with all the hype and bought a bunch of alt coins at insanely inflated prices before realizing there's no more people to sell them to at even more insanely inflated prices. Then, we'll see the public beg for regulation.

I'd bet this whole bubble is being manufactured to suck people in to buying a bunch of shit they don't really understand just to sour the general public's opinion of crypto currencies/make the public beg for regulation when it all crashes so the government doesn't seem oppressive by forcing regulation."
"Top would realistically be around $30,000/BTC.  That puts it at an ""average"" top 5 currency in the world, trailing only the USD and Euro.

Simply put: that puts it as an average top 5 currency in the world.  It was my target when I got into crypto.  It's still my target today.  Today's value isn't justified at all... it's basically saying that it can be used more easily across the world than either Russian Rubles or Indian Rupees.  That's not the case... not at all.

There will only ever be 21,000,000 BTC.  If it were to be able to be used as freely as the US Dollar, that would put its value at $71,873 / BTC.

Could it go higher?  Sure.  It has lots of pro's that needn't be discussed here.  But does it *deserve* to be there now?  Hell no.

Realistically justified price today is like $600/BTC.  In 5-10 years the $30,000 value will be justified.  In 30 years, a $100,000 value will be justified."
Nah, he'd probably be homeless because he wouldn't have had a car to get to his job to pay the bills.

Mcaffee says it'll go to 1 million per Bitcoin in 2 years. He's read the white papers

"Ah, happy to hear that (assuming you're not some impersonator xD). 

I saw your tweet before it started being massively retweeted and I felt fucking terrible for you knowing it was about to go viral. Since I saw no other tweets from you mentioning Bitcoin I assumed you didn't get back in.

I imagine almost no one managed to hold onto most of their coins from back then and many would probably be better off just never having discovered Bitcoin avoid dealing with crippling regret. Even if you didn't buy back in *that* low, I'm sure Bitcoin has treated you well 😉 Glad to hear it!"
I'd trim some at some point but I think I'll always keep some Bitcoin. I'd sell off all my other investments before Bitcoin if I had to do that 
"Obviously, that's different though. Selling early cause you think it's the highest it can go and selling it because you need the money are not the same.

That's the best way to do investments like this really. Throw some money at it you don't need and just let it sit there until you need it. Most of the time you'll make more money doing that than trying to guess when to sell for the maximum profit."
Honestly you can be pretty successful if you are patient and only buy into very low cap coins with some merit to them. There is monumental upside and little to lose when you avoid buying into scams or dead coins.
If I'd sunk my 800 before 1 week ago I'd probably have something cool to say but seeing as I'm hopping on the train with many others who are becoming coin curious we shall see!

If I'd bought coins instead of graphics cards in 2011 I'd have had 10,000 bitcoin instead of 30, but I'd have sold them on the way down from the $27 bubble because $25k was a lot of money to me back then. And I'd still have fewer than 5 now."

"the 2014 peak was difficult to sell things off at... mostly because it didn't last long, and then slid pretty far quickly and looked like it would likely recover but then never did.

I could have sold in 2014, but sold very little then because of this.

It's definitely wise to sell whenever it's at or near the ATH, but at the same time, people will always regret selling something when the value triples or more later on.  "
"> Anyone in their sane mind would have cashed when in peaked at 1200 in 2014

I did this. I went in biggish at around $10-12. I now drive a Tesla and live in a nicer house, but... those things were *very* costly in hindsight lol"

"> If you want to make money, and you've held for over a year already, why not take some out and go wild (or not wild)? Otherwise, what's the point, what's your endgame? To make more money? Then what? Leave it to make even more? Where do you stop? You have to withdraw one day, and you never know which day it is that you'll get the best value.

I withdrew $30k or so and went to latin america for 15 months. It would have been a lot, and I have barely any left, but on the other hand that may have been the best experience of my life so far."

"Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation

Banks will insure your account, but only up to $250,000 (multiplied by the number of people on the account) anything over that is kept in the account at your own risk. If you want to store more money you have to use private banking (which tends to have very large minimum balances) or split the money between multiple accounts."
"Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. It federally ensures that a deposit up to $250,000 in a private bank account can be recovered in the event the bank cannot pay it or the funds cannot be recovered. 

It was introduced by Roosevelt after the Great Depression when banks were shutting down by the barrel load. "
"Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Basically the US Government guarantees that if you have your money in a bank and it goes under that you will get it back up to 250k. It is meant to stop ""runs on banks"" where everyone freaks out and ills all their money out of the banks like they did before on Black Tuesday in 1929.

The poster above you is saying it isn't wise to keep that much money in a bank because if it folds you lose all but 250k.

"> It's an absurd amount of money

Not on a ""rest of your life"" timeline.

50,000 is a 3x fluctuation, not a 1000x.
There you go. Just pick the right metric.
"You don't need to light them on fire, though. You just buy them. They usually take care of the ""fire"" part themselves."
"uh... no, not even close. Real super cars are $1mil each. Mansions cost 2 - 20 million to start with. Private jets? Maybe to get a ride for a vacation, but certainly not to own or even lease. 

Don't get me wrong, $25 mil is a hell of a lot of money, but it's not buy everything you want money. "
£25m is not even close to private jets. Probably about half or third of the way. 
You underestimate the cost of all that. You are also forgetting taxes.
I love the sound of a “functioning millionaire”... kind of like a functioning alcoholic, but you know fuck you rich.

You're not. That's petty much exactly what's coming. You stake in a pool, get Ether in return. No more mining. That's pretty far off though, hope for 2018.

"Because the public will beg for it since a bunch of people are going to get fucked over in the great bubble burst of 2017/2018 and blame the lack of regulation because they were allowed to recklessly invest in what they thought were bull shit and fraudulent companies with little to no oversight, but in fact is probably just a couple of developers and an open source software with no real means of securing a return on the investment.

Google ""Buying bitcoin on credit"" and just look at the number of sites offering bitcoin purchases with instant/no credit verification. The search results for ""buying bitcoin on credit"" started spiking around Thanksgiving of this year. The market has started to become whales propping up the price so they can unload their grossly inflated coins to suckers who will be left holding the bag, or people buying bitcoin on credit from other people who bought their bitcoin on credit, which is an engine that is quickly going to run out of steam."

"> Of course, buying a private jet is no small task. Jet prices range from $3 million to $90 million, although 85 percent of Varsano's customers buy second-hand aircraft. He said that most jet owners switch jets every four to five years, much like car owners, although these vehicles cost a bit more to run: depending on the size of the aircraft, it can cost between $700,000 to $4 million per year to run your own aircraft.

Getting ready to sell about 30% of mine. I'm in college right now so my plan is to sell some of my gains/aggressive altcoin trading every break and hodl during the school year. I missed out on tons of profit since I sold Bitcoin in the 3 and 4 figure range, but it's made this past year of college *very* comfortable and been able to treat my girlfriend and I to some fine dining and fancy hotels.

Over 250k per account exceeds fdic. 
So what stops me opening two accounts at GDAX and simply trading BTC back and forth to myself to give the appearance of rising prices (although I am not making money net)?
"yeah!  The dream of 25 million is amazing.  But it's just that.

"
Of course, but if I were you I would buy the bitcoin now, it can increase quite a bit in a few months.
Also, if you live somewhere like Canada, only half of your capital gains are taxed, so you end up paying like 25% taxes on your $1.25M/yr. So it’s almost a million in after tax income (it’d actually probably be over a million because, as you say, 5% is modest)
"I'm nitpicking, but rate of return != safe withdrawal rate. It's counter intuitive, but it you can get into trouble if you don't know about safe withdrawal rate studies. 

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/safe-withdrawal-rate-swr-method.asp

A safe withdrawal rate for a 30 year retirement period is 4% or less. If you're in your 20s like the twitter kid in the OP pic (so a 70+ year ""retirement""), you're looking at 1-3%, depending on how much risk you want to take on. 

So a 250k to 750k annual budget is more likely for the long haul. That's obviously rich, it's not 100 exotic cars rich. You'd be spending upwards of 100% of your annual budget on just one car supercar."

"Consider that there is minimal difference between ""why did I sell then"" vs ""why didn't I buy then?"". The vast majority of the world has missed out on a growth where investing even a days wage - however much or little they earn in a day - early on could have made a major impact on their lives. 

This is what people need to consider with events like that: We all ""lose"" vast opportunities every single moment of our lives through inaction or lack of foresight or lack of willingness to take risks (e.g. almost everyone here likely knew about BTC at some point where we *could* have stretched our finances just a little bit further and bought a bit more, or sold some at some point where we *could* have held on), or because of too much willingness to take risks, and just in general because anything we do have unforeseen follow on consequences.

The only real difference is that most of the time we don't know what we lose out on, because we don't have immediate visibility into the value - financial or otherwise - of the decision we took or didn't take.

So we can let ourselves get torn up over the lost opportunities we can see, or look forwards instead.

There is also the fact that developers can program their Dapps based on neo with any language that then is translated by some kind of vm to neo language, kind of like java, so a lot of developer could do a lot of projects based on neo without having to learn a new language unlike ethereum.
Yeah a similar smart contract platform based out of China, with a couple differences. A big one is that it generates GAS when you hold it, which I gather you can use to pay tx fees. Seems like a solid idea, but I’m not an expert by any means.

This is why it's a dumb idea to broadcast having bitcoins on license plates.
That was kind of my philosophy, but getting my BTCe account hacked and drained changed that. I sold a bigger chunk of my holdings to recoup what I lost on that.
Bro, I feel you. I mined 50 blocks of BTC on a laptop back in the day. I spent 100 BTC just gambling in the early days. Much later I cashed out between $5 and $20. It tore me up watching BTC rise, but I got over it. Shit happens, no one can tell the future. Now I get to claim a small part of BTC history as my own.

Prepare thy anus for the tax pickle. 
"Bitcoin does not need to function effectively as a currency to be successful, it is more of a store of value that you can think of like digital gold. Gold is also terrible for day to day purchases. *Payment* systems are a separate thing than gold and we are in the very early stages, but payment systems are being built such as lightning network.

We had cash for a longtime... and only later did we get PayPal, Square, etc.

It doesn't matter what anyone *intended* regarding Bitcoin, it exists as its own entity, beholden to know one. It works because of monetary economics so all you need to be able to do is buy and hold it. Holding bitcoin *is using* bitcoin for what it is better at than anything else.

There are still tons of people who don't get this: people who have flooded this sub, people who were involved early but didn't understand what they were doing so sold or will sell at some price (laptop mining dogecoin in 2013 didn't teach me monetary economics). Plus, all the econo-idiots calling it a bubble when it is more like the pin to the ponzi-like system of government backed debt-laden money. Then you have the 99+% of people who only vaguely started hearing about bitcoin, but aren't buying any. You however asked a question and didn't get offended even when I was rude so you too can be part of that 1%, even if you're not part of the 0.001%.

It might go to zero, but so might the USD. Bitcoin is backed in solid math and threatens USD so I see it as a 50-50 shot. If I'm wrong, I lose what I put in, and keep working to make more money. If I'm right, it goes up 100x or so."

Forget mcaffe I'm following Greg sochen- the legend who called BTC at 6 cents lol "
What-ifs can sting, but you did the best you could do with the information you had. Selling what was then a new, unproven commodity for a 500% gain was a smart move.  
He's prob not alive any longer
I feel the feels
He might have bought them back again at $8 . Wish so :p
This again?
Honestly he probably bought again at a good price 
That people would stop karma farm reposting him?
Probably for the sweet release of death.
Tfy
For a quick release
he's probably dead.
Rip
He'd be wishing for lower fees and faster confirmation times.
Get fucked is all I can think of. 
Poor fucker has had this tweet reposted on this sub every other week now 
He wishes he wouldn’t know BTC. 
This is why you don't sell all your coins
Fucking $25,000,000. It’s crazy to think about, but it’s also crazy to think he’d still have that if it rode up to $100 per coin. Almost all of us would’ve sold. 
F
Rip. Ple
You're taking this well. Don't let it get to you man especially the assholes who rejoice at others loss.
"I have a tweet from around the same time, ""BitCoin at €3, this is crazy"", I didn't buy it then. Some guy retweeted it around late-October of this year.

I had to do the calculation, had I invested €600 back then, I'd be a Millionaire by late-October 2017.

I also have a terrible tweet from 2012 about Andy Carroll being a better signing for Liverpool than Sergio Aguero would be for Man. City. It got picked up in mid-2016 and I was getting slated in Quote Tweets for weeks.

C'est la Vie"
I regularly throw 20 bucks here and there at various small coins. Having about 800 or so invested in 30 different small coins is basically my way of having fun gambling.
So what you are saying is that I should buy 1,000 coins of each sub $.01 currency that I come across and in 8 years time I will have $25 million dollars and a Lambo at least?
Satoshi is still holding though.
ya but can you actually find the USD cash to cash in that 25mil btc? i dont know if its that easy. plus when millionaires cash out it makes btc worth less

what do you mean today? they're $26,100,000
"He probably bought back in no?

i wouldnt be surprised if hes no longer with us.. O_O
Could he really have cashed out that much?

"The thing with investments is he didn't just make the decision to sell it at $0.30, he made the decision not to sell it when it was at $0.07, $0.08, $0.09, ....... $0.29.

This same principle applies for every single day from 2011 to now 2017/18 as you see the price going up. It isn't just one decision to sell it for 25mil but thousands of decisions over the course of 7 years. 

Anyway you look at it, 5x ROI for anything is pretty amazing."
"I lost 10k BTC on an encrypted hard drive that wasn't backed up which had mechanical failure. Yes, I'm sad that I couldn't sell it back when it hit $1600 the first time. But I won't beat myself up over it.

Everything that I now have is backed up."

"If you bought some a dollar worth of Bell stock at the right time you could have sold those and buy microsoft stock with it, around 1990. THen if you had sold that around 1999 you could have bought some Apple stock with it. Then in 2010 you could have sold that and buy some bitcoin for it, then sell that bitcoin in 2015 en buy some ethereum with it, then sold those ethereum in august 2017 and buy some bitcoin cash with it then sold those 4 month later and buy some litecoin with it and then right now you would have more money then exist in the world. 

Damn. "
It never hurts to make a profit. 
Why aren't we all hurting the same? We all had the opportunity to mine enough bitcoins on our laptops in 2011 to be billionaires today. 
I’m sure he rebought it. If he was smart enough to invest then. I’m sure he went back in. 
How exactly does one actually sell the 1,700 BTC to get the $25,500,000?  Are the big exchanges even capable of serving this kind of request?
Name checks out 
Money is just money
Hindsight is 20/20.  There was no way he could've known at that time what the future value was going to be.  So he sort of acted rationally with the information available at the time.
20 million isn't THAT much

He ded. Justifiable suicide.
I don’t think anyone could have predicted how bitcoin has gone. 
Hes dead.... suicide... 
"The fun part about human nature is that we all know he kicks himself for selling, now that he would be worth 25 million bucks.... but the tweet actually proves he would have sold at $8, even if he held past 30 cents.

So even if he held longer, he would have sold at a million different points along the way. The only way he would have held to be a millionaire is if he lost his btc wallet and forgot about it until now.... "
"Pffft, Check out the legend of kankraka.

"Buy and sell any coin like you bet Blackjack.

Invest 100% of your investment.

If it hits 200%, take out 100% so the money left in all came from the house.  

If the remaining 100% hits 200%, let it ride.

If it hits 400%, take out half, or 200% of the original investment.  Now you have 300% in hand + 200% still invested.

Then let it ride until you get to 800% of your original investment and take out half.
Now you have 700% in hand and 400% still invested.

If this user had followed this strategy, he would have withdrawn $52K to date, and would be sitting on 3.3 BTC, worth another $52K.  He would be waiting to make his next move, selling 1.65 BTC at ~32K.

Personally, my own strategy is to HODL!"
Sometimes when life is going too well I look through my transaction history on electrum from a couple years back to even things out
"Me in 2011: Hey wife, I want to spend some money and buy some bitcoins. 

Wife in 2011: What? No, that sounds dumb. 

Wife last week: Hey, do you have any bitcoins?"
The number of bitcoins lost must be in the hundreds of thousands if not millions, which makes that 21 million even more rare.

I sold most of my bitcoin when the xbox one was released when it highed at $1200. A friend of a friend found it hard to believe that I got into bitcoin back in 2010, thing he doesn't realize is that this was common back then. No one knew it was going to reach as high as it is now. I don't regret selling because I got use of the bitcoin I had. I still have some, and sure id have more money if I hadn't sold, but for the time, it was worth it. The more I think about it the more it is upsetting which is why I try not to let it get to me.
"What was that about Hindsight being 20/20?

Give it a rest, ya'll. "
This is such a trap for investors... the ghost of Christmas hindsight is real.
"No one would ever wait for $13k. People sell when they make a good profit. That’s the smart thing to do. I bought some BTC at 300 and sold most of them at 900, used to money as a down payment for my house. I kept a couple coins but I wish i hadn’t sold any. However, if I didn’t sell at 900 I would probably have sold at $2k. I’m 100% certain that I would have never risked waiting till now. I had a goal, my moon was to get a down payment for a house and I got there thanks to bitcoin. 

No regrets but I do think about the fact that I could have fully paid off 2 houses and had some left over if i waited till now. The growth this year has been beyond my wildest dreams. "
Cant predict the future. They could have been worth $0.00
Wasn't this posted recently?
If everyone would hlod the coin would not grow in value. 
In an alternate universe he held them and the butterfly effect caused bitcoin to fall from grace and disappear
Probably that he had sold before it went into unpredictable freefall.

If no one sells Bitcoin or spends it, it falls as a currency.

What’s worked well for me has been a partnership with somebody else. We make a great team because our coins can’t be sold unless we both agree, which prevents impulsive selling. There has been times I wanted to sell (more than I’d like to admit), and she talked me out of it every time except once when I desperately needed the money. And there’s also been the odd time she wanted to sell and I talked her out of it.  Because of this we have been able to reach higher gains (at ATH) and hold on to 90% of our original balance.
This is why I have made myself promise that I will hold all my crypto unless I was in dire financial straits. Even if I do become a crypto millionaire, I won’t spend it all. I will hodl forever and it’s part of my retirement nest egg plan and even when I die, it’s getting passed to my kids. I am a firm true believer in this technology. It is world changing and amazing. 
Wise words, if you remove the double negative there...
It was different with Bitcoin because it was the ONLY thing to invest in for so long. If you paid any attention at all in the tech world you had heard about it and could have thrown down 20 bucks just because it was an interesting idea
I am :D
In other words constantly making profits. That’s not bad with such a risky investment. 
"yea, it's weird.  All these people are saying he would have $25M today.

But could anyone really hold that long ?

working shit job, in debit, but have $25M locked away in crypto.

I think most people would sell when it hit $100K or $1M or $10M or slowly take some off during price spikes.  

Even $50K can be live changing amount of money for some people (if it means them getting out of debt or having some security).  You can't retire on it, but if you gave most people a chance to cash out at $10K or $50K, I think they would, or at least partially.


"
"How's that working out for you?
I've thought about doing the same"
yeah and that will cost you only a couple million to accomplish since there are thousands of coins and for every sub penny one there are multi hundred ones...
Yeah, you’d have 100 in a climate controlled garage bigger than a Macys department store staffed by gorgeous Armenian women in skimpy outfits who say things like “yes sir” and “anything you need sir”. Sounds awful. 
I used to do this on Yobit, buy coins at 1 sat that were at least sometimes trading up to 2 sats and wait for the 2 sat order to hit. This worked great until they opened Doge markets. Now the 1 sat coin is only worth fractions of a sat. and I'll never be able to sell it for nearly as much as I paid.
There actually is a guy doing similar to that, holding a bunch of coins, but more for experimental reasons. [Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7m3cts/buy_and_hold_31_cryptocurrencies_for_365_days/)
Directed acyclic graph (DAG) coins like IOTA and/or XRB will be hot stuff in a few years.  Get yours while you can.
Wise words on wise words here
"Because if everyone holds then merchants do not bother to accept bitcoin as a payment. 

And if no one is spending our currency, just mining and hoarding, that doesn’t really encourage the thousands of startups and think tanks and tech development. "
There is a fixed number of Bitcoins. If everyone held it, there wouldn't be any transactions and it wouldn't be a currency. I'm not too versed in Bitcoin, but essentially it has to move around for it to work.
He's a sacrifice
I don’t think when you earn money on an investment, that makes you a martyr....
Sorry to hear that. Are those coins just out of circulation now? Never to be recovered? 
"But didn't the market for ""goods"" purchased with bitcoin guarantee the movement of coins?"
You're welcome :(
If everyone would hodl, there would be no supply and the price would skyrocket. 
Noted for possible future time travel.
what are you mining today friend?
"Because we didn’t know. 

There are a lot of things I could’ve done differently if I’d known. No point beating myself up over not investing my lawnmowing money in middle school. Besides I had a lot of fun on that bike. "
I don’t invest much in penny coins bc it’s an absolute shit process buying them using fiat and the tax situation is a clusterfuck for someone who just wants to hold various coins.  
Yep! I bought a small purse for my wife on overstock, it was about $80 bucks in bitcoin. I’m too lazy to do the math but let’s say that’s $5k today. I tell my wife she’s got a $5k purse better take care of it!

"Or, you know, Bitcoin could have crashed and burned and he'd have some valueless bytes of information, and no car.

Investing and waiting for greater returns is all well and good, but at the end of the day it's still money. If you're holding just to maximise the money you'll make, then you're better off withdrawing and actually enjoying the money you've made. I'd rather look back and say: ""Hey, if I'd left my money in there I'd have loads more now, but I would have missed out on the cool stuff I did with it"".

If you want to make money, and you've held for over a year already, why not take some out and go wild (or not wild)? Otherwise, what's the point, what's your endgame? To make more money? Then what? Leave it to make even more? Where do you stop?
You have to withdraw one day, and you never know which day it is that you'll get the best value.

Now if you're holding onto it for a belief in the technology, that's a whole different kettle of fish that's completely unrelated to its exchange value."
Well, at the very least, you’ll be sort of a Twitter legend for as long as BTC is around. 
Same, had 6BTC in my first wallet (2011) that I saved the wallet.dat to a thumbdrive and wrote the private key on a slip of paper... but I've moved three times since then so both are MIA

"Damn! Nice pick. I got into ETH at $200, still in 

I'm going big on NEO now "
I feel like no matter what it is so hard to find peace with cashing out. Like if you cash out too early you regret it, if you cash out too late you regret it. Only the 5 people who cash out at the ATH will be able to confidently say they made the right choice.. 
Making any profits?
"There were also people who said bitcoin would never in a million years hit 1k. 

Then they said the same about 10k. "
Disregarding everything else (I dislike speculating), there's reason to believe that as many as 30% of all Bitcoins once in circulation are now lost/destroyed.
yessir all $100 he used XD even becoming a millionaire when price was in the hundreds would have cost upwards of $30k

The rapid rise of so many cryptos has been a bit worrisome, especially considering most don't really warrant the price given their capabilities. However those that provide actual value will keep on chugging. 
"No I never forgot about it, I checked regularly and thought the price was stupid bubble.  After spending a few months in the $1-3 range, seeing the price hit $40 then $80 then $100 was absolutely surreal.  I was sitting on irc channels telling people that they are bonkers for not being skeptical at a sudden 100x price surge.   It was madness. 

I didn’t forget all about it, I definitely cashed out too early though lol.  "
my man
Gotta find a talking mudcrab.
Would you have been able to sell it all off at these prices, though?
Great question - I've been thinking about this too. I'd like to see discussion from someone who actually recently cashed out significant bitcoin and then moved that cash from the exchange to a bank account. I'm guessing you can't just drop that kind of cash into your average savings and loan where most of us have accounts. 
So he's only £24.95 million down? 
What do you do in the case of a loss after initially investing? That's not the case for me but just wondering what you think!
[deleted]
It would be hard without dropping the price. I wouldn't do more than a couple at a time. Maybe hit up a big exchange in person and try to cut some deal in person for the keys. 
The way I see is yeah you sold but plenty of people had the same information and didn't buy in the first place. 
"That's why I'm not mad about the 50 BTC I had that I (probably) ended up wiping off my drive. The most I would've gotten was $15k since I only remembered I had them when I heard BTC was $300. A decent chunk of change, but I paid $20 for some, and got a bunch for free.

I checked all the harddrives laying around my mom's house, but none of them had my wallet. Shame. Pretty sure I must've wiped it at some point, but not like I actually lost money. "
False, my HDD would have crashed with my private key on it because I wouldn't have thought that amount in USD was worthwhile enough to actually keep super safe (like I do today). 
"This was about the time I was thinking of buying in but I didn't because I thought ""this is a dumb fad that's going nowhere.""

Haha..ha..ha.. :'("
False - I would've forgotten about this silly thing and lost the hard drive...
Most realistically you could say if you bought magic internet money for 6 cents a coin you'd probably forget all about it until you heard about it on the news. Which to my understanding is how most BTC millionaires were made lol 
"And where do you draw the line then? When it will be ""enough""?

As people said, even if this guy held, where should he have stopped? at 10k? 50k? 100k? 1M? 10M?

Never cashing makes way less sense than cashing out at a 5X profit."
"Except there aren't that meant lambos out there. I'm holding; don't get me wrong, butt am I incorrect in thinking that buyers at 15k aren't future millionaires?


Maybe my assumptions are faulty, so please correct me if I'm. wrong. I bought ~ $700 worth of btc -- most at 10k per btc, and a couple hundred at 15k. I'm not going to turn this into a million bucks. I also invested about equally intolitecoin and ether. And I'm holding all of it. 



It's getting media attention now, and coinbase seems to be growing exponentially. I just don't think there are that meant millionaires out there.  There can't be that meant people that wealthy. So what is the ceiling? How much can 1 or 2 thousand bucks worth of bitcoin now be worth, at the most?  Assuming best case scenario, I won't be a millionaire on byc alone.  No way. Maybe turn it into 50k...but even that seems high.  I say max..... 10x what it is right now.


I don't now. I'm ignorant when it comes to this, but holding anyway bc it's a worthwhile risk while I'm young."

Yeah unless you're both independently wealthy and a true believer it's sensible to cash in to pay off the credit cards, student loan, mortgage or give your kids an education. Having a chunk in your annual income in a such a volatile investment while you're living hand to mouth is foolish.

"Exactly. Realistically no one is giving up a 500% ROI.

All this ""if I would've just held onto it"" talk is just that, talk. If you wouldn't have sold it at 500%, you would've sold it at 1000%

There's literally nobody that would give up on cashing out 100k, waiting a few years and just happen to be able to cash out at $25m"
The hooker he 'sold' his coins to for 15 mins of pleasure is laughing now.
Oh, I see what you did there.
Odds are he would have bought back in way back then and still be stupid rich..i wouldn't worry to much lol
It's a story now, I only think about it when numerous people on Twitter mention me to tell me how much I would have when bitcoin goes up :)
what is ama request?
"> I wouldn't have had a fucking car haha

Thats becuase you buy a car only with a small fraction of your BTC hodlings. 

If you liquidated 1/4th or more, you are doing it wrong. 

Always keep half of your hodlings in a HW as insurance. "
">""haha"""
I'm pretty bullish on ETH, bought a couple at $12 and I swear I'm never selling, for some reason that's not worked out for me in the past... ARDR is the most recent coin I've been meaning to take a deep look into, but from what I've heard it's got some interesting features.
"not really, could have cashed out the 100 bucks initial investment and kept the rest, that's 400%, but who cares, 100$ is chump change CHUMP CHANGE

but yeah, i've been down lower than that many times.... many times..."
Absolutely right....very genuine and clear thought...
If I'm being honest, I was expecting it to dip and I was gonna buy back in, I did much later of course. I've got some old SatoshiDice transactions that really sting. Bets of like 10BTC that were like $30 at the time and could buy a house with cash today.
Or 27M
That's just silly - even if Bitcoin becomes the global standard and everyone uses it, there's only about $5 trillion in circulation right now and a maximum of 21 million (roughly) bitcoins - which puts the max value at $238,000 per bitcoin - account for maybe 1-3% annual inflation, and you're looking at a maximum of $263,000 in five years, and that's in a perfect scenario where it became THE cryptocurrency and the global gold standard....there's a lot to be resolved for that to happen - not least of which is achieving widespread acceptance and ease of use while avoiding angering a government and becoming illegal.
