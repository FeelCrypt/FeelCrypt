What movie?
Which means it's pretty fun if it involves certain substances
Isn't the description Indian Bollywood movie redundant? 
So then yes?
Relative to most Bollywood movies actually very good and less cheesey.
I actually found it pretty entertaining. Although i rarely watch any movies so i dont know if its objectively good. But does that really matter as long as people are entertained lol.
Good point. 
I'll take that as a yes.
It has 7.2 on imdb, watched it last year, great movie. 
No American subtitles, wouldn't recommend.
Bollywood movies, whether good or bad, always give me blue balls. JUST KISS ALREADY.

That first option's called dollar-cost averaging and it's actually the most efficient way to invest (besides having insider information)!
A typical investment strategy is putting in $X every week or month for a year or 2 or 5 instead of all at once. If you're right about it being a good investment over time, volatility will be negated by your averaged contributions at set intervals and you will wind up in a good place.

How do you avoid losing so much in fees when converting from fiat to crypto?"
"1. What is the percentage of bitcoin being used for purchasing real items e.g. goods and services?

2. Even if it is being used to launder money, does it matter for the baddies to lose so much value?"
"""Buy and don't think about selling"" was the best advice I was given. I waited and waited and it screwed me. I've been following bitcoin since it was <$100 and decided to buy in as much as I possibly could during the $3000 all time high run a bit ago (my average buy-in is about $2750). I'm holding until we hit the moon like I should have done years ago."

"It can be argued that Bollywood even relies on the other woods for ""ideas"". Or in other words, just borrowing scripts for a quick buck. When Bollywood does decide to make something original, with a decent budget, they make great movies. But for the most part, they are just churning out recycled shit from other industries. Before the social media, they heavily borrowed from Hollywood as well."

Yeah but it deals with mythology/ancient tales so it’s much more “extra” than other Bollywood films.

Ok so I really hate Bollywood, but this movie was legit good, it's s historical drama based on a hindu warrior king,who broke the social norms of the time and married a Muslim woman. It has has some great battle sequences ( not those flying and slapping people to the ground ones) it's good.
it is good. It is based on maratha histroy i guess. 
Saw it. Thought it was excellent. Great visuals!
It's actually pretty good. The director Sanjay Leela Bhansali  is one of the few non shitty directors. You can give the movie a try. Its a history based romance movie. 
It has 7.2 on imdb, watched it last year, great movie. 
It is REALLY REALLY good!! Based on actual historical figures and a great soundtrack and perfect acting, check it out!!
Actually it did good in comparison to other Indian bollywood movies
It's pretty good actually. Has some nice acting and cool action.
Entertaining? Yes. Good? Not so much. 
Looks fucken awesome!!
It's an epic movie, worth watching it with English subtitles, as the actual dialogues are in Hindi.
Its a bollywood film, isn't the entire point the song and dance sequences?  
It has really cool war scenes with Hindu and Muslim warriors. Very different from the usual medieval knight wars we see.
It's great. Song where this GIF comes from is catchy as all hell.

That applies to almost most forms of investment that can net you more than a percent or two per year. If you get equity it's usually best if you know you can afford to sit on it for a time such as ~ 5 years.
You can buy any fraction of a bitcoin.  Beyond that, be wary of taking any investment advice here!  It is cool and interesting stuff though - I'd recommend looking into it.
"It is a massive bubble, and I say this as a btc owner. The currency will never solve its issues with deflation and volatility that will, on a fundamental level, prevent it from ever forming the basis for a modern economy. 

That said, in the short-to-medium-term, it's a good investment. This is a very risky market. Nobody knows why it's worth $4000. They only know that it will keep going up. This market is the blind leading the blind and a recipe for a bubble. "
"1 Bitcoin is ~$4000 and you can buy less than a full Bitcoin. I don't want to jinx anything because I wasted my luck on coconuts, but it's probably not going down anytime soon.

(On the off chance Bitcoin starts dying, blame the fuck that called the coco-tastrophy before it started)"
It is very possible it will crash back to 3000. This might also be the start of another bull rally in which case 5000 comes quicker than you think.

Most Indian movie gifs on reddit are from older movies. As India grows richer, so do production budgets. Right now they are slowly inching up the international market, and I think they recently set some records in earnings in the US and China.
No, India has other languages and they have their own movies and studios .
"Bollywood basically refers to Hindi Films shot from ""Bo""mbay production houses. Likewise every major region has their own movie industry in their language. so Bollywood represents 1 of 8-9 major movie industries coming out of India.  
"
"Let me be clear, Bitcoin will almost certainly drop in price soon. Historically after large run ups in price, there's a crash. I expect this runnup to be no different. That being said, the price has always crashed higher than the previous all time high. And Bitcoin has risen in price exponentially since it was invented 9 years ago. There's no reason why it would slow down any time soon. Just remember though that you can't time the market, so don't try to pick the best time, just buy and don't sell it during the inevitable crashes to come over the years.

And yes Bitcoin is divisible so you can buy any amount you want. If you only want to buy $1 worth, you can. "
"How is there an issue with deflation if there is a fixed supply?

Isnt the volatility just caused by it being in a state of infancy for a global currency?  Its marketcap isnt even close to a currency right now.  When its 10000$ a bitcoin and people are talking about bits instead of bitcoins 5000$ swings will be nothing.  Essentially the same as the dollar."

Though I haven't seen the movie, it's probably a victory dance. The movie it's about Bajirao, a military general in the Maratha empire. He never lost a battle in his 20 years of military career. Marathas wanted to drive out the Mughals from power and reestablish Hindu rule over the subcontinent. At the height of their power they controlled about half of the subcontinent but could not consolidate fast enough to prevent the Brits from gaining a foothold and profiting from the power vacuum.

"I think you have it wrong as you consider Bitcoin as the actual currency used for everyday transactions.

I think Bitcoin will take the place in crypto currencies that gold had in Bretton Woods. People don't worry about lending gold and interest rates on it.

The currency for daily use will be based on Ethereum or something that has shown willingness to be flexible with the blockchain and where you have options to manipulate the supply."

"A lot of the stuff that's posted on reddit has come from parodies, satires, tongue in cheek films and b movies. Yes there is an inherent cheesiness to bollywood films but films in India serve a different purpose than films in America. Films in India are more about escapism. India for the most part is still a very poor and working class country. Films that focus on the every day drugery dont do well in india as they do in america. There have been films in india that look at social issues, salaam bombay, earth, fire, kama sutra are all examples of these. However these films do better in the western world. 

Movies are very cheap and accessible in India and are filmed in a way that you don't need to know  Hindi to actually follow the plot lines. That's because India is huge and full of dialects and one movie has to work in a lot of areas. 

Tldr: bollywood is more focused on escapism than Hollywood."

I've personally hated Indian cinema for the last 30 years. The 60's-80's were my favorites. Beyond that it looked like people ran out of ideas. The actors were terrible, music was shitty and the storyline was usually pathetic. After a long time I'm feeling I may have missed out on a few good movies."

Store of value.
It is. For starters, curry is more liquified, not powdery.
To give a realistic feel of a warrior the director made every dancer wear heavy armor. The lead had to wear that and on top had to dance like crazy. I remember the actor said in a interview.
I kinda like it, it makes it feel like the song numbers kinda float back and forth between being a classical song and dance number, and kind of like something that is subtly going on in their head during the actual moment. I wonder how much of it is intentionally trying to evoke a feeling like that, and how much of it was just logistical.
It's Hindi:)

"**Seigniorage**

Seigniorage , also spelled seignorage or seigneurage (from Old French seigneuriage ""right of the lord (seigneur) to mint money""), is the difference between the value of money and the cost to produce and distribute it. The term can be applied in the following ways:

Seigniorage derived from specie—metal coins—is a tax, added to the total price of a coin (metal content and production costs), that a customer of the mint had to pay to the mint, and that was sent to the sovereign of the political area.

Seigniorage derived from notes is more indirect, being the difference between interest earned on securities acquired in exchange for bank notes and the costs of producing and distributing those notes.

The term also applies to monetary seignorage, where sovereign-issued securities are exchanged for newly minted bank notes by a central bank, thus allowing the sovereign to 'borrow' without needing to repay.

"""A Brief History Of Crime: How The Fed Became The Undemocratic, Corrupt & Destructive Force It Is Today""

>History suggests that the only way to rein in the sprawling Federal Reserve is to end its money monopoly and restore the American people’s ability to use gold as a competing currency.

>The legislative compromise that created the Fed in 1913 recognized that the power to print money, left unchecked, could corrupt both the government and the economy. Accordingly, the Federal Reserve Act created the Federal Reserve System without a centralized balance sheet, a central monetary-policy committee or even a central office.

     

>The Fed’s regional banks were prohibited from buying government debt and required to maintain a 40% gold reserve against dollars in circulation. Moreover, each of the reserve banks was obligated to redeem dollars for gold at a fixed price in unlimited amounts.

     

>Over the past century, every one of these constraints has been removed. Today the Fed has a centrally managed balance sheet of $4 trillion, and is the largest participant in the market for U.S. government bonds. The dollar is no longer fixed to gold, and the IRS assesses a 28% marginal tax on realized gains when gold is used as currency.

     

>The largest increases in the Fed’s power have occurred at moments of financial stress. Federal Reserve banks first financed the purchase of government bonds during World War I. The gold-reserve requirement was dramatically reduced and a central monetary policy-committee was created during the Great Depression. President Richard Nixon broke the last link to gold to stave off a run on the dollar in 1971.

     

>This same combination of crisis and expediency played out in 2008 as the Fed bailed out a series of nonbank financial institutions and initiated a massive balance-sheet expansion labeled “quantitative easing.” To end this cycle, Americans need an alternative to the Fed’s money monopoly.

"Having reversible transactions is not impossible with bitcoin. Multisig with a counterparty for example. And second layer solutions.  

And who decides who gets their transaction reversed in fiat ?  (I dont really know, but it seems not all transactions are reversible atleast) "
"Fixed supply of a currency means effective deflation:  if the economy stays flat then prices of goods (denominated in that currency) stay flat - but if the economy grows then prices of goods will fall.  So bitcoin is effectively deflationary.

If you were a govt using bitcoin to manage an economy, then this would be a problem - most economists think you need low levels of inflation, and most central banks try to achieve this.  

But of course that's not the kind of currency bitcoin is - so I disagree with u/GuyBelowMeDoesntLift that this is a problem, certainly not in the sense of affecting the price of bitcoin.  Most people considering investing in an asset or currency would regard fixed supply as a very good thing indeed.

You're right that if bitcoin is going from $0 to whatever its stable level will be, you'd expect that to be a rocky road, with lots of volatility.  "

Sounds just like Hollywood 
The movie is more about his love story with other woman he took as his second wife, even though that was pretty illegal. Besides, he wasn't just a knight. He was the prime minister and a member of the high nobility of the Maratha Empire in the 18th century.
"""based on"" a true warrior's famous love affair. So a lot of creative changes to the real story. But still a good watch. "

"That was a journey


10/10"
Fucking awesome, thanks! The best Bollywood scene I've seen since Chaiyya Chaiyya.
Where can I watch this with english subtitles (the full movie that is)
"The currency is designed to be deflationary. At some point in the very far future, there will never be any new bitcoins made, while the number of bitcoins that exist on the market will continually decrease due to things like hard drives being corrupted or people forgetting their passwords. All this means that after, say, 2050, one can reliably expect a bitcoin to be worth more tomorrow than it is worth today. This is good, right? Wrong. This is because of what we use currency for. If I'm a bitcoin lender, I will be substantially less likely to lend out my bitcoin if I know it'll make me money if I do nothing (this as opposed to an inflationary currency that would incentivize lending). What this would do is put upward pressure on interest rates, reducing the number of people who can buy expensive things - fewer people can buy a house at 3% interest than at 1% interest. This permanently hamstrings output and is a problem that can't really be solved. But it isn't even the biggest problem. 

Volatility is always going to be an issue for bitcoin. Sure, we won't see the insane fluctuations in price we see now, but the total lack of a regulatory body like the federal reserve means that the price will always be subject only to market swings - there is no force in place to control the market price. This will, by definition, increase volatility. What this will do is, in conjunction with inflation, further disincentivize lending and raise interest rates. Think about it - if I'm a potential moneylender, why would I lend out my money when there's an equal chance it'll be worth +/-20% compared to other cryptocurrencies a year from now? Uncertainty about interest rates creates skittish activity and depresses an economy. Only this depression would be permanent, because there is no Paul Volcker to step in and save the day. I don't have the tools to say the magnitude of what would happen, but it nevertheless provides a major obstacle to its adoption - what government would knowingly adopt a currency that would permanently depress output and additionally removed their regulatory authority?

I believe the above to be nearly insurmountable problems for bitcoin as a currency of the future. They aren't necessarily indictments of crypto as a whole, but they highlight the fundamental problems of bitcoin that are, by design, nearly unfixable. All in all, I don't see bitcoin ever approaching the extremely optimistic guesses people have for its long-term value. "

Haha I have 7.9126 btc. Made 10k doing nothing
"Just after this his hits the floor slamming it hard to then rise with all other bowing there heads to him.
Could this be a sign that bitcoin drops hard to then rise higher with all alts falling???

ahahaha this is fucking great I only have like 0.3 though
BEST. POST. EVER.

Full version is definitely way better. Its both hilarious and epic at the same time!"
I hope Bollywood isnt contagious 
If only I had money or a good GPU when Bitcoin became a thing. Congratulations to you folks who are able to cash in

How could this happen, though? 
I love this community! Bitcoin is the people's coin of choice. 
That movie was cheesy af, especially with the dancing. Trust me, I'm Indian, and my mom watches way too much movies. 
I want to try and get some even though it'd probably be pointless for someone of such low income to get some. I've tried investing before but every single time I've tried something I've lost money. I've never come out on top in any situation.
This is Ranveer Singh in the movie Bajirao Mastaani. It has some really great songs and choreographies. 10/10!

You can still buy one more. Might not be possible after a while. 
I bought two. I wonder why I didn't buy three. 
This subreddit will have an aneurysm. 
Because more people are investing in it. The price is based on the market cap. It was 20 billion back in the beginning of May and it is 66 billion now. 
It happens from time to time. It happened in 2011, 2013 and 2017
It seems the civil war is over. Bcash fork is done with, SW2X fork seems to have been called off, and Segwit is going to activate very soon which allows for the largest feature upgrade Bitcoin has ever seen (unlimited scaling, instant transactions, make spam more expensive, more transactions per block).
"Two reasons:

1. confidence and thus price was suppressed for a long time because of political drama
2. positive feedback loop when demand increases against a completely inelastic supply

Of course, confidence can get too high and then the bubble pops. But one interesting thing about bitcoin's price history is that, so far, it has always come back stronger after a big bubble popped and this has happened 4 or 5 times already.
"
The only money I have is 55€ and I'm 24 years old. And I want to die too. I guess money makes no difference.
I've seen a couple posts here talking about when they sold theirs. Is there any reason why people sold all and didn't keep some? Or have people done that and only the ones who have sold all are commenting?

"read the bitcoin whitepaper: satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org and read the history and make sure you understand what you're investing into. Bitcoin can be a p2p and decentralized electronic cash for everyone worldwide (though some peopler {who sensor this subreddit} want to change that).

If you like the idea of money no one can censor that isn't expensive to use and has to middlemen, Bitcoin can be got for cheap right now!"
Also, ignore the Eth shills, invest in Eth once you understand the difference between Eth and BTC. BTC is the more established currency.
Never invest in anything because of FoMO.
"Wheee, brain dump.

Most of what I say below will apply to other cryptocurrencies, but since we're in the Bitcoin sub I'm just referring to Bitcoin - other cryptos have different features, but the core functionality is similar.  This is also fairly high level (ELI5-ish), so don't necessarily take it as investment advice or an absolute reflection of the network, but it can get you started.

---

It's effectively like trading in a foreign currency.  As economies do different things, the value of it relative to your local currency will fluctuate. The biggest difference here with BTC is that it isn't backed by a country, it's backed by a decentralized network that processes and confirms transactions - effectively a worldwide currency with its own economy.  Similar to a normal currency, it can also be used to pay for things - I've actually purchased goods with it because it was easier than sending a check or working through a credit card form.  It even uses online exchanges to change your currency to/from Bitcoin (or other cryptocurrencies).  

Also, since it's a general point of confusion, you don't need to buy a full BTC to invest in it.  You can purchase fractions of a BTC, down to the hundred-millionth of a BTC.  Most people don't jump right in to buying a full bitcoin.

---

Since it's still relatively new, and seems pretty promising in terms of its features, people here tend to believe that BTC value will significantly increase in the long term - it's all crystal ball guess work, but the general feel is that $10k-100k/coin is likely on a long enough timeline.  The most realistic estimates I've seen so far are loosely $5k by end of year, $10k in about 5 years, and $100k in 10-20 years - but, again, guess work with lots of variables.  Besides the capabilities of the currency, most of the hope around it going up is the fact that major institutional investors haven't really started investing in it yet - we're effectively still in startup investment phases, proving that it's viable before big banks and places like Fidelity start buying into it, which will increase the value.  Some financial advisers are also starting to recommend it, like CNBC clips have been popping up a bunch recently.

As far as timing and what's going on specifically right now vs a few weeks/months ago, there was a lot of network uncertainty regarding some technical changes.  That recently got settled in a survival-of-the-fittest style split (""fork"") - with the change splitting off to its own network.  It's a cool setup, since if the network can't come to agreement on something, it can just split off a branch and actually give it a try to see which option works best.  As an investor, that works similar to a stock split - you start off with one share, and wind up with two (1 BTC, and 1 BCH in this case).

---

Most of the involvement from people here is in terms of just investing or using it for payments, but you can also setup a computer to verify transactions (no monetary benefit, just helps the network), and even set up a device to process transactions (""mine"" Bitcoin) - although that typically isn't profitable in the consumer space these days due to energy and equipment costs.

My involvement specifically is just on the investment side, although I think the backing technology is cool and try to stay read up on it (I'm a software dude, using cryptography to create a self-regulating currency is just awesome).  My experience from the US has been that it's pretty easy, but you should still take precautions, and don't expect to go from nothing to moving money around overnight.  You still need to follow local regulations, tax laws, etc. and those rules include some steps that can take a couple days to process.  I think my initial ""decide to invest"" to ""actually purchasing some BTC"" timeframe was around 3-4 business days, but now that it's all set I can pretty much purchase at the drop of a hat.

Definitely ask around here if you want to know more.  There's some occasional chatter about things like bank accounts getting closed or other things you might not expect, but if you just pay attention, do your research, and take precautions it should be pretty safe."
"Bitcoin is a global currency that is distributed across computers across the globe. Similar to how the internet is distributed and cannot be shut down, bitcoin has the same attributes. 

The Bitcoin exchange rate tends to go up over time because unlike most currencies, Bitcoin gets rarer and rarer over time. Every 4 years, the amount minted gets cut in half.  By 2040, 99.9% of all Bitcoin will be ""minted"" so people have been buying because it gets more scarce every 4 years. 

Bitcoin just hit $4000 today which is an all time high"

"Hit up some YouTube videos, there's some really good ones out there. There's some good info in these comments too.

There will only ever be 21 million bitcoins in existence (even less in our lifetime). This means that if it ever becomes popular enough that hundreds of millions of people use the currency, owning one whole bitcoin will be a pretty rare (and expensive) thing."

"Technologically superior, yes.  

But ""without the corrupt distribution""?  Bitcoin isn't exactly evenly distributed across the population.  And I don't think I would call the distribution of money ""corrupt"", it's just... people have more or less resulting from a complicated mix of luck, ambition, and ability. "
Which part is technologically superior?
$250 invested at 2500 would be 0.1 BTC.  So take a tenth of the current price.  $415 as I write this.

You have it completely backwards. The market cap of bitcoin is calculated by multiplying the price that is paid for one share with the amount of shares in circulation.

Well it's basically one of the most visionary films of the century, I mean they are actually celebrating bitcoin reaching 4000 $ in a Bollywood movie from 2015 when no one could have imagined that happening. Who would expect that? A must watch for sure. Who knows what else u can find in this film if you watch it closely.

The bottom line with any crypto is that no one knows what will happen. Could go up, could go down. Its anyone's guess.
What does it have to do with the gif? 
Exact same here, hah. I remember irc channels where they would give a whole bitcoin or two out just to help verify your wallet.
I'm just going to try and ignore bitcoin so I don't think about it 
I'm with you on this one, I think about buying small chunks and average it out, or wait for it until it drops.
"Yeah. People always think about the chance of one of these new currencies going big and give up because its a tiny chance.  But its better to think about it in terms of cost vs reward. 

Because the cost of bitcoin was only like 1 cent each then. The cost to you of buying 1000 is basically 0, we lose 10 dollars on stupid stuff all the time. But the potential reward is massive.

From now on every time a new currency comes out that looks promising and is very cheap. I always buy some.  I won't miss the 10 dollars, but in a few months its suddenly worth 1 million and you're set for life."

Coins are so volitile in price that literally everyone has got fucked by holding on too long or not holding on long enough. Everyone bought etherium at $15, and sold at $35 instead of $400; some people bought at $400 and it's been sitting between $200 and $315 since. 


Basically just buy bitcoin, make an account at bittrex, move your bitcoin there, research some investment worthy coins, by em, and either day trade or just hold em. It's fun but can really keep you up at night and wish you had a crystal fucking ball."

I would probably mess up the choreography and be hated by all. 
It is definitely a bubble though. The big question is : how big is it? 200, 400 or 600?
Some people said the same thing when it hit $28 in 2011.
"Take anything people write here with a grain of salt. I read through this page and there are a lot of people recommending ""dollar cost averaging"" which a simple visit to the wikipedia page is apparently heavily criticized.

It sounds great. And it does one thing: It gets you to trade stuff like bitcoin. Which is how many businesses make their living.

You are not going to get a great and explained answer and least of all a consensus from a random reddit reply by a pseudonym like me. So treat it like gambling. It's like investing in anything else, you can look at the past bubbles and draw your conclusions. But in the end it is a gamble, just because BTC always recovered so far, does not mean it will to the future.

If I had the secret answer, why would I share it here in a way that you and everyone else lurking would understand? If selling is the right answer, then my objective would be to get the rest of the world to buy and vice versa."
Personally I wouldn't invest during an all time high like we're currently in. Give it a few weeks or months and the price will most likely go back down a few thousand before doing it's next bubble. I fully expect 10k Bitcoin price in the next 2 years.
Treat Bitcoin the same way you treat gambling, only as much as you're willing to lose.

2016: ""I fucked up and I dont know where my ancient mining wallet or passwords are"". 

2017: ""Eh, I'll invest when the prices stop going up.""

Now I'm at the point where I'm wondering if I should dive head in and add more to my collection or if I should expect a crash any time soon. "

Compared to most of the Indian film gifs I've seen, I'm guessing this movie actually had a budget and could afford a proper choreographer. I'm impressed.
