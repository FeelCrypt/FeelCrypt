Problem with that is Wikileaks clearly states the CIA was looking into how to do it in 2014, yet Hastings died in 2013.

"People simply haven't been paying attention. [Mainstream journalists have been reporting on the technology to hack vehicles for years](https://www.cnet.com/news/car-hacking-code-released-at-defcon/). Zero days and the suspicion that governments maintain a collection of them have been reported on for quite some time and there was even a big documentary that came out last year on the subject. 

So far nothing in the current leaks should really surprise an informed person. Unless future leaks provide evidence of specific cases where classified tech has been used in an illegal or even unethical manner, then the only value I'll see coming from these leaks is to confirm what was already suspected (and maybe provide a distraction from the political drama at the White House). Unfortunately if the Snowden leaks weren't enough to wake the American population from their stupor then nothing will."

Welcome to the world of where if you're not liked, you go to jail because we say so.

"It isn't even just that the CIA can take out political trouble makers, it's that the same hack can be used by *anyone* who finds it. So China, Russia, the U.K., etc will likely find the security holes in the self driving software of Ford/Toyotas/whoevers system.

So you piss off China, they have 50 million American cars full of even more Americans that they can crash. Same with airliners if they can be hacked too. Makes a nuke seem tame. "
It's not up to each individual user to check all of their software by hand -- the GNU/Linux community is massive, and has many community projects with very talented and dedicated people. If there's a bug or backdoor or anything, even if *you* don't find it, *someone* will. Furthermore, you can compile all your GNU/Linux software from scratch (even the kernel), so you can at least be sure you aren't getting a tampered binary.
The most powerful voting bloc in the country can barely spell computer. Hopefully it's not too ingrained by the time they all die.
Seems to me there has been a massive psyops campaign to deceive and confuse American voters. Most people over 40 are so utterly brainwashed by cable news.

"Wikileaks, who is definitely *not* working with the Russians, released an unverified document that says the CIA is capable of adding Russian fingerprints to hacks.

Therefore the CIA hacked the DNC to help get Trump elected for... reasons... but now the CIA is undermining Trump with fake Russian leaks because... apparently *opposite* but equally mysterious reasons.

It all makes *too* much sense."
How's that?
Makes the Carolina conspiracy even more plausible. 
"You think the demonization of child porn in recent years is for children?

His Wikipedia page also says both his brother and his wife believed it was an accidental death. I feel like that's pretty important to point out.

True, though not before cutting brake lines or other forms of sabotage.

So we are officially back to the (((HILLARY))) is supreme super villain narrative... The dude never even announced running for Senate. He was the pilot in the crash, but you would rather believe that Clinton had him assassinated before he even got in the race?
"I'm a pilot and I flew out of the same airport on the same evening.  The visibility was worse than reported on ATIS.  I turned back and landed about 40 minutes after taking off because I couldn't see shit and it was barely VMC.  A ballsier pilot with some instrument training might have continued their flight.  Add darkness, passengers who just want to get to their destination, and water below you (which makes it hard to distinguish from the sky) and it's likely you'd become spatially disoriented and turn your plane upside down. 

I'm no fan of Hillary, but this one is on JFK Jr. "
While Bill Clinton was president. Shocking.
His name was Robert Paulson.
It's not that I don't acknowledge it's a possibility and definitely not that I don't understand how it would work (I mean, the literal reports of what literally happened are how it would happen...), I just think that we don't have enough info and concrete connections to say conclusively that this is what happened. In fact, I'd say the evidence we have encourages a skeptical view rather than jumping to a conclusion. There are points on both sides, but nothing points to it definitely being an assassination right now.
"What would make you accept that they were experts? Or even knowing about a possible hack when the rest of the world doesn't even know what the CIA is capable of? 

I'm not trying to be argumentative here I just find the leap on logic, well illogical. "
We don't know if pressure was applied to them.  If you have someone killed this isn't too much of a stretch.
A cyber attack would be undetectable to us today. Anyone could be killed by the CIA and we'd have absolutely no way to know. 
"If you have some foresight, you could give the CIA ""reason"" to target you.

Start an anti-cia propoganda blog, send a few emails making claims that could be interpreted as a threat to CIA etc. and you could then claim in court that the CIA targeted you because you're an enemy."
"> Carolina conspiracy

Please elaborate."
I think it would be something that helps defeat the case, like fake emails conspiring to hurt the company they were at, for wistleblowers.

They do this to keep us safe from bad hombres amongst us who wish to harm us bigly. It's been pretty effective, to judge from the few terrorist attacks that have succeeded.
James Comey himself did his tenure at Lockheed Martin.  It's blatantly obvious.  His entire resume is political-lawyer, political-lawyer, political-lawyer, VP OF ULTRA LARGE TECH & WEAPONS COMPANY, fbi director.

As much as I hate Trump too, he might've been right about wiretapping. Maybe not the Obamas exactly, but someone likely did.

"The technology to hack vehicles existing, and the technology to hack vehicles being actually sought and used by the CIA, are two VERY different things.

It's one thing to say that it exists or that it's possible, it's another to know that your intelligence community is researching it and KEEPING IT SECRET.  That's the key, these exploits they are aware of , they are PURPOSELY keeping them secret to utilize them.  Why would the CIA ever need to have secret backdoors to hack someones vehicle?  We both know the answer to that, but you can't get people to believe this stuff unless there's actual evidence of it.
