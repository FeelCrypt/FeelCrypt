"Exchanges are businesses that make money by buying currency in and then selling it off with a profit markup slapped on.
When the currency you are working with is suffering from hyperdeflation, an exchange is taking a serious risk buying such a volatile asset. They would be paying you large amounts of (relatively) stable hard currency, in return for something which may be so expensive tomorrow that no one can purchase it.
Remember how several exchanges closed down transactions of bitcoin last year, because of the huge price hike in bitcoin?
Exchanges still need to make a profit, and so they still need buyers, so you end up back with the original problem."

Yeah, I think ublock origin is quite good at blocking that.
Like others have said it is not worth it. Basically the only reason it is worth it for some people is because they own sites with a very large userbase (e.g piratebay), so even though each user is only contributing a small amount of hashing power, it adds up. For mining at home your best option is a top-end GPU (1080ti, or next gen) and even then you'll be lucky to break even.

The basic miner is just code, javascript. It could be bundled in a virus or other kind of malware, though.

Noscript is useful beyond blocking mining scripts though, it was around before mining scripts were a thing to combat intrusive ad scripts and other dirty shit.

Blackrock started at about 8 bucks a share and they closed today at 483.  So if you bought $1000 worth of blackrock in 1998, it'd be worth about 60k.  If you took that same $1000 in 1998 and instead bought Apple for about 50 cents a pop, it could potentially be worth up to about 600K today depending how much it was diluted over time.  "

">The value of insurance is the sum of thousands of unlikely situations in which it may become useful one day.

This right here. It's really hard for most people to grasp just how deep this goes. Many people come here to post shit like ""pshh, as if the US dollar/government/economy would ever collapse"" or ""why would anyone need that much security for their cash"", followed by ""just use a bank"". It's astounding because people are so used to placing their entire faith in these institutions that *could actually collapse* (unlikely as it seems at the moment when everything is fine). Then they go and point out the price variance of Bitcoin as ""proof that it can crash"", as if the USD wasn't just as vulnerable to the whims of the market. At least Bitcoin is tamper proof; trusting any government to always be responsible with their fiat's supply is the real case of hopeful thinking."

"I assume you live in a developed country - and you are under-assessing the likelihood that (when times get tough) the government won't try printing money to solve problems.

You may also incorrectly believe that the money in your bank account is yours and is protected.

People in Cyprus thought the same thing.  Until one day, the government ran out of money and reached their all-powerful hand into every bank account in the country and took cash directly from consumer bank accounts. As early as **this year**: Greece proposed to do it again by [proposing a 30% haircut of all accounts holding over 8,000 euros.](https://www.ft.com/content/9963b74c-219c-11e5-aa5a-398b2169cf79)

This is the ""come on"" for crypto."
Wouldn't the price tank after you sell though? For example:  If I sold 100 billion dollars worth of Apple stock @ $205 per share, I'd get the 100 billion. The stock would probably drop sharply below $205 right after I sell. Those selling right after me wouldn't be able to sell their stock at that same price.
I thought of buying some when it was about $200 but I was somewhat worried about it. So much for that plan.

"I know this is a thought experiment, but: Why would you even need to win the lottery more than once? A single Powerball win of several dozen or hundred million dollars will set you and all of your family and friends up for several lifetimes. There are people out there that DO NOT stop at that. Their greed fuels them, they want to maximize the money they gain. But concentration of money is hurting more and more people while barely further improving the life of the already rich. I personally wouldn't keep more than maybe 5-10 million in investments - that's still A LOT. Everything beyond that I would put into family/friends debts/education/housing, research (medicine, green energy, aerospace technology), animal shelters and charities.

Agreed, it pisses me off how the default is to basically just trust that sites won't try to fuck you over too hard. Like naw I'm about not trusting them at all, just text and no pictures for me unless I decide I need them. Makes sites load faster too.

"In 2010 Julian Assange started accepting Bitcoin. I remember this happening and I knew Bitcoin was a thing. It was basically a way to jump through a LOT of hoops to give an alleged rapist some money.

Silk Road lasted from 2011-2013. At that time, Bitcoin was absolutely known as a thing. Again itwas used as a way to pay for shady things.

The idea of buying Bitcoin for Silk Road was incredibly unappealing - to get it, you either had to trust some weirdos on the internet and send them actual money, or you had to spend time ""mining"" on your own GPU. (And remember the bitcoins weren't worth much so you'd have to mine a lot of them to get enough to pay for drugs.) Then you'd get into the ""Dark Web"" and hope that a different weirdo didn't cheat you or rat you out and then MAIL YOU drugs, which raises the risk that a dog at customs or USPS will find the drugs and then you'll get arrested.

In short it made no fucking sense at all to get Bitcoin back then. If you wanted drugs, the smart thing to do was, you asked your stoner friend to get some for you and you gave him a little extra for his trouble.

There is absolutely no reason that Bitcoin deserves a high valuation other than as a form of speculation. Yeah, sure the banks might get together and make cryptocurrency a thing, but why would they do it with Bitcoin instead of making a new cryptocurrency?

Anyone who invested in Bitcoin as an investment when the people taking it were Julian Assange and drug traffickers is certifiable."
"No asset will ever keep going up. 

Anyway maybe I didn’t make my point clear. It already has a use.  As a censorship resistant way to have your own bank. It’s not like ETH which really reason doesn’t have a use at the moment just potential. "

"Oh, I don't doubt the tech or the network either.

My point about the scarcity is that this is just the start, proving you can have something immutable and valuable stored there. Whether or not it stays an actual currency, there is always going to be something of worth there and that's not likely to change anytime soon."

Wrong.

A) Bitcoin cannot be a viable alternative to fiat if the total market cap is too low. there needs to be enough liquidity to make a currency viable.

B) Wanting something to become a currency (medium of exchange) is not mutual exclusive or in conflict with viewing something as a speculative investment. The first reason for this is that there are transitional stages. Bitcoin may become a currency and become stable, but in the mean-time there is speculation potential. Secondly, the economic reasoning underpinning Bitcoin is that medium of exchange and store of value are not mutually exclusive. Hence the supply cap and method of distribution (and Genesis Block message!)."
I think you misunderstood my comment. I wasn’t saying fiat currency is any way better. 
Damn. You just wrote out my whole thought process that I went through thinking about whether I should order some treats from silk road back in the day. I may have even gone as far as buying the BTC, but I don't even remember if I did that. I decided that the risk want worth it.
It depends on how define its utility. Since it can be used as a store of value simply keeping as much as you want in it is itself useful. Don't think of buying the bitcoin so much as storing value in it.
Cheers, thanks for the advice
"As I always say, most people seem to forget about the utility of ""immutable ledger""...

Take in the case of land grabbing... land grabbing by the rich is often done by making a newly created title and faking all the supporting records (through buying them out), then buying the court so ur title becomes the ""fake"" one... 

An immutable ledger won't allow u to ""fake"" or alter the records (theoretically)...

This is what happens in our country... if this doesn't happen to urs, then u likely live in a first world..but ur country is not the majority in this planet...

Okay fair enough. Thanks for the response :)
The price wouldn't tank if you sold as it went up. Like if you decided to start selling at around 15k. Your $178 million worth of bitcoin would have made the price go up- there was alot of demand, and you are the supply. The problem would be getting it out. If you had sold those bitcoins on several exchanges thats connected to a bank account, but doing it on one exchange, good luck.

I'm also not an expert in browser based mining operations, but from what I understand, they utilize some of your computing power to mine crypto in the background, right?

If my assumptions are correct, then you have chosen to absolutely destroy your experience across the internet in order to keep a few miners from using your rig without your permission. 

I'm not condoning mining without consent, but that seems really extreme to me. Sure they're stealing computing power from you, but outside of a few bucks on your electric bill... it doesn't really go much further than that.

"I first heard of BTC somewhere in late 2009. It looked fun, so I tried to mine it but after reading a few things it looked like too much of a hassle.

I believe I created a wallet and had perhaps a few btc or maybe 0.5 btc or so thanks to these free faucets. But you know, it was worth only a few cents or so back then so I didn't care too much.

Then again in 2010 I saw that it went up, and I believe it was back then that I read that story about someone buying one pizza for 10K BTC. But I was studying in Japan, and had better things to do than to be interested in this kind of stuff.

Reading this thread, there are many people who think about ""WHAT IF"" and I think this is a really bad mentality. What is done, is done. You can't change the past, you can only change the future.

So, is BTC worth investing? I don't know. I'd wager to say yes. Only time will tell how much it will be worth.

You have made mistakes in the past, I'm sure you're making mistakes as of right now, and you will still continue to make mistakes throughout your life. That's how things are. Learn from it, but don't keep thinking about it constantly. Just move on with your life."

"This is what I tell myself when I think about not buying Bitcoin at .09 - that I would've sold my stack well before it hit prices like today or December. Only a lucky fool would buy that low and expect it to reach thousands of dollars.

So people always talk about Bitcoin mining in the sense of strapping a whole bunch of gpus to a computer and destroying your electric bill in the hopes that you'll gain a few pennies. Is anyone out there ACTUALLY mining Bitcoin? Like going down to the dump, digging up old computers, and checking the hard drives to see if there's any coin in them. At this point, that method actually seems more profitable than simply hoping to god it doesn't tank, or you sell it the right time without investing all of it again two weeks later only to lose bigger than you won in the initial sale. All it would take is one hard drive with about a hundred Bitcoin on it stuck in Granny's computer that she threw away to make it way more than worth it. I hear stories on the sub all the time of people who accidentally threw away a computer but they forgot they had coin stored in it.

"I've thought about this one a lot and I've always wondered what the MOST profitable thing you could do would be if you could go back in time.

The most obvious things seem to be stuff like investing in Apple, but with how many times the stock has been diluted there's no telling how much your shares would actually be worth.  There's also the looming threat of you being investigated for insider trading if you somehow manage to have the foresight to sell at the perfect time to maximize your profit.

That makes bitcoin seem like the best option.  You could buy tons of it without upsetting the market in the early days and then slowly sell it over time since you'd know exactly when the dips are coming.  Obviously you wouldn't want to dump your whole stash at once because that fucks the market but if you were strategic about when you sold I feel like you could milk billions out of it with almost no effort.  You could make hundreds of millions just selling right before the huge China crash when they were going for like 15K a piece.  "
Hindsight is actually quite easy to gain. Foresight is the tricky one.
"I'll do you all better. 

1) become rich."
Heard of this guy who had loads of bitcoins stored on a hardrive on an old computer that he threw away, so in some landfill there's millions of dollars worth of bitcoin that that poor guy knows exists but can't get back. 
"I've never owned bitcoin. Quick questions:

Let's say I had $178 million in bitcoin in 2017 and wanted to sell it all. What is the process from selling it to getting the money transferred into my savings account? Is all that bitcoin money in a single bank or is it spread out over many banks? Would the transfer be pretty much instantaneous?"
I remember bitcoin in 2009 and my wife told me the classic “do what you want” and all I wanted was to invest like $200 in it.

See that's the problem. Everyone wants to get rich but no one wants to use bitcoin as a currency. It's still an asset and will remain so.

Honestly, would this actually work? How do you even sell Bitcoins? To who? Do you sell them bit by bit to different buyers or can you sell them all in one go to one source?
as someone who chickened out on buying bitcoin in order to buy acid on the dark web in 2012 this cuts deeep man.
Still love how the character looks like roger
Always do research before buying, always use money you can afford to lose, always make sure you OWN your coins and always trade like a vulcan. Emotionless and logically. 
LMAO at all the 'hindsight' salt.
Such a “tech” perspective, any investment that can afford you a reliable used car from making a few clicks is a no bad investment. 
If this ever happens to you...just sell 80% and keep the other 20% as a risky bet 
About 10 years ago, I didn't have money, but I had lots of time. I heard about bitcoin and started reading into it. I gave up when I found out each coin would take me way more in electricity than the coin was worth. I cri evry time. Q~Q
All of our lives summed into one meme. 
This hits too close to home. 
Good old days. When BTC was 77$ around that time. Now people who mined and lost their hardware are freaking out to get hands on the precious digital currency. Good post :) thanks !
Finding somebody willing to give you 123m dollars and not sell your details to a drug lord is a problem all its own.  
With perfect hindsight, I would have been worth $1.5 billion.  It's... Painful.  But then again, with perfect hindsight I'd also know which Powerball numbers to play.
You could do this with so many investments. Just enjoy the gains and ignore the ignorance 
This picture is the reason why I'm glad I didn't get into Bitcoin until later.. I would of bought like 500 btc for like 5 bucks back in the day and would of formatted the hard drive or lost it somehow and would of spent the rest of my life thinking of what if...
Wow this is similar to me. I had 50 bitcoins in 2016, sold them all for a minivan. I could have had 34 minivans.... damnit!!!
Id probably kill myself if I had done this, no joke. That’s why I’m glad I never got into it
Everybody has 20:20 hindsight but I won't lie, I stay awake some nights just thinking what life would be like if held the bitcoins I got in 2011

I wish I had bought at least 1 Bitcoin when I had the chance. I did not think it was worth it at the time though.
"I know a guy who invested in BTC back in 2008. Bought in at around $0.60(ish) cents. Sold it later for $8 and was angry at himself when BTC went to $36.  

If only he would have HODLed to 2017, his BTC would have been worth a cool $40 million."

The problem is not in not predicting a rise in value, it's in hodling. It can be very difficult. 
Used car is a weird way to spell drugs
"Why do people sell out so early 

I know nothing about bitcoin the market or investing but i sure as hell wouldnt sell out my stock until i atleast see alot of profit (i.e. more then enough to buy a used car)"
Are they saying a 2003 Ford Taurus is a bad thing?!?!?
"Did that around this time last year. Under extreme pressure to sell because ""it's going to drop"", I got out at 3.5k. Bought a nice used SUV. If I held, I'd have a new NICER SUV. I'm still kicking myself in the ass."
Who the fuck still crying about this?

Well, hindsight and all. He was just as likely gonna loose everything, so he at least got a car out of it.
i wish i saw it before i joined the market haha
Time machine is the answer to all problems.
This image omits the investment in mining hardware and contracts.
If you have that many bitcoins, don't forget to store it in a cold wallet!
"This was me.  Dropped $1K into BitCoins when they were worthless.  Held them for awhile, came into a bit of financial hardship, sold for close to $1K.  

I have a decent life and a nice car, but the what could of been kicks me in the nuts from time to time.  Oh well."
I was so close to buying 3 last September before it skyrocketed to 20k. I still get aggro everyday thinking on it! 
I did this during the early years. First big spikes happened and I was delighted to turn £100 into a £600 DSLR and lens. Still got it. Nice camera. No regrets.
Some dude is really living this somewhere lol hodl
I genuinely feel bad for the people who picked some up only to forget about them or sell them way too early
The best meme I've ever seen.  This needs to catch some wind in its sails! 
Is still don't understand Bitcoin
Or literally any stock/investment/property. 
Honestly, this is why I bought 600k Digibyte. 
It’s a ‘fucking’ 2003 Ford Taurus. Seems like a pretty good buy to me.
Now do one for the people who invested last year and lost two thirds of their money!!
Or 4) invest and get very lucky
That’s how I do it.
Yeah the doctor took my foresight away at birth . Girls still like it that way though

"> That makes bitcoin seem like the best option

Soooo basically what you're saying is bitcoin early adopters = time travelers from the future? ;)"
"I've been saying for years, if I could go back in time and have 10 seconds to deliver a message to my younger self, I would say to buy TONS of small amounts of bitcoin before 2011, **learn to secure the fuck out of them**, and do not sell until they are over 70% of my net wealth.

I've definitely gotten 2 and 3 down, but the hindsight of 1 is what I missed out on.  "
Blackrock stock. Big gains and dividends all the way up unlike apple/amazon/etc.
Such WoW!
8 :(
send me cad file plz
Why not just sell it on an exchange?
yeah the numbers definitely overwhelm the issue.  like if you said, 1 taurus in 2010 or 5 tauri today, I'd go with the former probably (immediate gain).  1 in '10 vs. 50m in '18...I think delayed gratification starts to sound pretty good!
Just predict the next lotto numbers, same thing.

Do you mention Chrome here because it is the only browser that has this problem or because it is the only one you know of that has a plugin to block it?
"I've got a limited supply of schmeckles for sale. Only a thousand dollars each. You in? Guaranteed to rise in value.

The problem with investing in bitcoin in 2010 was you weren't just betting on the fact that it *should* rise in value, you were also betting on the fact that anybody would take it seriously in the long run. That's the hindsight OP is talking about, not the really the currency mechanics itself."
Anything **might** rise in value.  Hell maybe one day 1998 Toyota Corollas will be rare as shit and people will start paying $60,000 for low mileage examples.

True, just buy some for investing and some for spending. Price goes up, more bitcoin value to spend.
"The comic wouldn't have been funny if it said ""The 10,000 bitcoins are now worth 10,000 bitcoins""."
Btc is like fiat already, slow to move and outdated.
Pretty much. It's pretty ironic the thing it was designed for doesn't attract people to it. 
I remember discovering Bitcoin about 6 years ago with a friend, I was like 18 and broke so I didn't even think about investing. Fast forward to December of last year, I bought $40 worth while Bitcoin was worth over 19k dollars. I laugh everytime I check it because my $40 is now worth about $15. Totally worth it.
"Fiat by definition is government approved. No one is forcing you to use Bitcoin therefore it needs a ""come on"". The idea of it rising in value is mostly what makes people adopt it."
This is why I'm glad that one DOGE will always equal 1 DOGE
I bought at 19k.... lost $18. 
Lmao
How many BTC did you have?
"In all fairness, buying early, selling around 2013-2014 would have been your best bet.
If you had held on, you wouldn't necessarily have had more, because when you are hitting tens of thousands of dollars per bitcoin, only people of questionable fiscal capability would be buying.
Perhaps you have several million dollars worth of bitcoin, but you still need a buyer at the end of the day."
no way is buying a ford taurus a win when you could have had like 50 million ford tauruses if you played it different
lol
wait what? is it only when youre mining for bitcoin or is everyone vulnerable?
Nobody could predict a deflationary currency with a limited supply might rise in value?
4) Cease to exist after creating the time paradox.
You might grab some winning lottery numbers while you are back in time too.

It's not been fun so far. 
Heh look at these dorks. My OG bitcoins are still safely in Mt. Gox
So what would it be like?
Why don't you buy some now?
If you knew what you know now, would you say that you would suck dick to get enough money to buy, let's say, $1000 worth of BTC back then? 
"I'm a software developer so i've always had exposure to new technologies. I remember hearing about Bitcoin around 2009 in the office and it was always something we joked about: ""You should mine Bitcoin"" and then we'd all snigger. None of us had any idea of the value it would increase to

Long story short, none of us mined Bitcoin. If we had, would've probably mined a lot. I can imagine the competition that would've arose in the office ""I've got 500 more BTC than you""... ""Oh, I better get mining some more then""

I'm sad that I never did mine Bitcoin when it was easy......"

this is to real
trying to sell that much at once you'd tank the price.  you can keep it in one or multiple wallets. you can sell on coinbase and transfer to your bank account
Over money. Damn shame. 
Thousands of people tell a similar story. A handful of them are probably even telling the truth.
As opposed to?
Why don't you DCA?
When were 10000 BTC ever worth $500 in 2017? I think you're confused here.
"These damn IBM 7200rpm drives...  
The clackering of death costed me my mined bitcoins.  
I did not think of it in any way. My games!  
I thought about it when it hit 1k. I would be a millionaire.  
The actual prices made me think about it again.  
There are soooo many coins of old folks like me which will never be acclaimed. A shame...   
**edit**  
This was in the Geforce 4200TI days if I remember it right. I modded the cooler and mined for 3-4 months.  
With a decent DSL line you could mine quite alot of coins."
That’s the thing. I was gonna throw $2k at them back when they were $0.25. Everyone thinks of the value it would have been at $10k/coin, never that I would have sold MUCH earlier
With that much money involved you'd have a team of lawyers and bankers on speed dial, and you'd probably sell OTC rather than directly on exchanges.
