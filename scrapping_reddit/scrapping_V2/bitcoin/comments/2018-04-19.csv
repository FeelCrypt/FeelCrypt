You're right but in some situations (I think when they aren't all the same type of fish or where you'd normally put an apostrophe) 'fishes' is fine.  The obvious example is the story of Jesus feeding a crowd of people using five loaves and two fishes (which David Blaine will never top).
So I've been spelling it fishies this whole time and no one has corrected me!
You can just mind when you're not playing though, end up paying for the card and your electricity bill
Lol. That’s too hardcore. That’s enough
"I imagine me bringin this up at dinner: ""You know, there is this video on pornhub...I mean, on reddit I saw, that there was a video..."" No save from there on, I guess."
is that the verge chart?
It can. 1080s are mighty beasts. If you know what to mine, you can recover the entire amount in a year. Also, since you have gaming computer, the CPU is also good. Mine cryptonight algorithm on it. It'll pay for electricity while gpu will pay for itself. 
i know this is good for bit coin 
seems it was removed and now there is a new one!
I didn't post it, just to be clear
Same was posted by PewDiePie. Do he watch porn?
That's so awesome.
Probably not. On one card I realistically could not mine enough coin to pay for anything. 
Verge?
So finally we have PORNCONNNNEEEEEECCCCCCTTTTT... 
See heres the thing I dont want to mine. I want a 1080 so I can play my vidya games at a higher resolution. I dont want to pay stupid money though since they were way cheaper before. 
DAAYUUUM HAHAHHA
burned the wick at both ends?
Goddamn this is good lmao.
Oh that's nice

That is super funny.....the crypto community on pornhub
I read this in Jared Dunn's voice from Silicon Valley.   
Java
Verge is in trouble no one will use that currency anymore cause it is associated with porn. Even I was thinking of buying it but prefered CS
That verge company had lost all the respect from people and I think thats so unprofessional for such a big company.. Thats exactly why I prefer more professional projects like Stellar or Credits
