">Bitcoin vs Litecoin exchange value has nothing to do with what I wrote about.

What do you mean? 

You claimed those shitting on crypto had no clue what they were talking about so I asked if *you could help educate someone* who admits that they don't have a fucking clue what's next. 

>Edit: your comment itself answers your first question

Exactly, as in any market *what someone will pay for it sets the value*. 

Only in the crypto market, especially considering the fact that out of my six friends who own crypto **not one hold their own private keys**, there is literally nothing *behind the crypto* whereas with a commodity there is an item theoretically of some consumer/industrial value and with a stock you have a company that *hopefully makes money*. 

What do you have with crypto? 

> total supply vs current market cap.

Irrelevant when you can fork the code and create the next coin. It's all about *what people believe*. 

The HODL'ers help solidify the market and then there are folks like me *who want an actual cryptocurrency* and even more who are looking for a get rich quick scheme.

So if someone is ""shitting on crypto"" make sure that you spend enough time listening to their arguments so that you can determine if they are churning FUD, full of shit, or providing you *honest advice based on their experience*. 

If you're under 40, it's likely that you haven't been *bit by a bubble*.

If you're under 30, it's likely you don't even *remember what a bubble looks like*. 

So remember maybe it's not that *the old guys don't get it*, it's just that they've seen this *type of thing before* regardless of the medium.

"I've been thinking about this. Even if crypto dies and doesn't exist in ten years it will have changed the planet. Many people who in any other circumstance would not have been wealthy are going to have a shit load of money. 

They are going to be able to do things with that money. Possibly world changing things. Starting companies, solving problems, running for office etc. The possibilities are crazy. Instead of a long line of rich family members running businesses or the country there's going to be a lot of new blood with new ideas. It's going to be crazy."
Every bitcoin transaction requires energy.  Gold transactions do not.  I think that’s what he’s talking about.

"Some profound misunderstanding of Bitcoin on here. As if it exists only for transactions. Or is a kind of a stock.

Bitcoin stores value free from government intervention. It's like having your own private Swiss Bank account. You send money anywhere to anyone at anytime without fear of it being reversed or seized. Some other blockchains (ETH) cannot even guarantee that 100%."

PayPal is censorable, BTC is not.
Thanks :D. Chameleon is an eh venue but it's nice for me because it's like 12 mins from my house. I head to Philly often for concerts too
At least can send to any country 27/7. Anyway - Segwit.
It's been in development for a while. I'm not sure on a timeline for it though. I think litecoin has a lightning network already in use so you should be able to find info on how it works if you are interested. 
"> This means nothing if the government decides they want your gold and can seize it at will.

Government can seize your bitcoin (they've already seized hundreds of millions in bitcoin), so this can't be the core point either.

""not if I hide it"", well you can hide gold as well. That doesn't make it any more useful. If you want to interface with legal markets you have to report your income and holdings. As you should for both practical, moral and legal reasons.

This is also straying from the ""store of value"" arguments. if you want an anonymous currency then there is nothing better than cash. A blockchain that keeps a perfect record of every transaction which will one day be decrypted, that requires interface with exchanges which keep records and has to ask for identification, is not.

The government is a lot more likely to try and seize something like bitcoin than gold. Gold is firmly established and regulated all over the world. Governments still hold a lot of their wealth in gold, they do not want to disrupt the gold market. Bitcoin is new and its use cases are mainly illegal, there is no underlying economy based on bitcoin that the government has to worry about disrupting. Without exchanges the current bitcoin economy would collapse and it would be trivially easy for them to shut down exchanges if they wanted to.

If you're worried about government then there are multiple other failure points that exist in bitcoin:

During times of crisis government often suspends internet use (including satellite internet). This will make bitcoin unusable.

Even if your government doesn't ban or crack down on bitcoin, a foreign government might, and due to the centralization of bitcoin mining, if China shuts down every bitcoin mine in its territory could easily cause a crisis in confidence which tanks the value of bitcoin.

Government can legally hack your computer and monitor your internet use. They have already compromised things like Tor.

If there's a societal collapse, the power grid will fail and so will the telecoms network, there'll be no way to operate the blockchain and bitcoin becomes no different to any other encrypted number. Even if we got blown back to the stone age gold would still be valuable (since gold was valuable in the stone age).

Very insightful haha
Nope, it is actually being used for buying stuff at an increasing rate.
Yeah, i frequent Lancaster often. Countless shows at the chameleon and trips to park city just to name a few. Also caught the train to Philly from there a bunch of times. Great city honestly. 
Would ETH be a good choice for that?
">> should have no problems scaling

Need to first prove you don’t need a centralized coordinator. Once that’s gone for good and it’s running for years, has become the “king”, then I’ll consider holding it.

Until then, it’s vaporware to me. Good idea and i wish the iota team the best on their quest."
Who do you think the banks are paying to get Bitcoin?
Or be in charge of a central bank. Same same.
Electronics, mostly.
It said banking. Each BTC address is like a Swiss bank account.
Oh okay that's only like 40 mins. Awesome!

"It has no use. It's a string of numbers. It will never become anything other than a useless asset/commodity. There are better coins out there that anyone in their right mind would use over Bitcoin. The whole point of this isn't just ""LOL THE PRICE HIGH"", it's to make something worthwhile and beneficial to the human race, and one single transaction using the same amount of power as 8 US households in a day doesn't benefit the human race in any way."
"Then you just change your direct deposit to deposit into another account. At some point you will need a government and debt collectors for credit to work. Crypto gives no advantage in the credit market; it only complicates things."
Although those are policies of the banks, I think those problems are also pretty much unique to banks. I dont think leaving your private key just laying around will be anywhere near as common as credit cards. I think the problems about reversing transactions are fair points, but they are problems with the blockchain and currencies themselves and not how they are stored.
"I appreciate your points and they're well thought out, but they're missing the core point. All I see is ""Audit audit audit, trust a 3rd party, put faith in the government and law"". This means nothing if the government decides they want your gold and can seize it at will.

Yes gold can't be printed. But that only solves one problem. Your account and the asset (gold) can be seized."
It is used as a payment system, just not a very effective one. However, the problems you referenced are being actively worked on as we speak. Different opinions on how to solve them are how we ended up with the off shoots of bitcoin that now exist. 
"It depends - is that 14.4k modem intended to replace the current internet connections, or invented in a vacuum with no competition? If the former, yes, if the latter, no.

As a currency, Bitcoin is the former."

Yes, but don’t let anyone in here know we are talking about this.
Why is that? Centralized wallets are essentially banks, and the only difference between decentralized wallets and banks is that decentralized wallets are cheaper, safer, and more secure (as long as you can remember your seed), but they dont let you choose your own password or have forgotten password recovery. You dont need to do your own banking, all you need to do is remember your seed. People dont generally forget their SSN, if its important they will remember, and if not, Im sure we can come up with a service to personally connect you to your seed.
Dash has instant send, which is literally an instant transaction...

They can be frozen or reversed or seized. And cannot be sent anywhere. Bitcoin is different.
My town had horse and buggy rides until this year when the town bought out their business for more parking.
Wrong. Price doesn't correlate with TX fees. Wallet software is the problem with fees. 
And if lightning network works? What then?
If anything it'll become the new gold technically. Though, our current currencies aren't backed by it. 
We are all speculating that congestion will be solved by LN. Bitcoin isn't even ten years old. Give it a moment.
Bitcoin has RSK. Smart contracts are a dead end though.

It isn't impossible to build a loan system on top of the block chain with the contract stored on chain and people putting Bitcoin into the loan via microloans based on certain payments and a certain expectation of return.

"Do you not see the contradiction in your own sentence

Yeah like srsly there should be virtually no fees ever, that was the dream, some alt is gona nail it.
Billions are being stored in cryptos already that are not being stored in banks. That's competition.
"I wonder if they actually like their job, or if it’s something they HAVE to do to make rent.

They don't store value when their value changes drastically by the hour. You can't rely on bitcoin because it can suddenly drop in value by thousands of dollars

"It's not about ""forgetting the password"" at all, it's about *securing* the password. Most people can't properly secure a their cryptocurrency seeds / passwords / etc to prevent their funds from being stolen.

Even if you make a stupid mistake and accidentally post a picture of your credit card on social media or something you don't lose all of your money, you can cancel the card, and dispute transactions that were made in the meantime. If your roommate decides to try to steal your money on the way out they may be able to steal something but what they're able to touch will be very limited. It's *almost impossible* to lose your money kept in a bank unless *you* very explicitly go there, carefully bypass all the checks and balances, and do something very stupid.

Wealth in the banking system being hard to move and transactions being reversible aren't bugs for most people, they're features."

"Bitcoin vs Litecoin exchange value has nothing to do with what I wrote about. 

But to answer your question it comes down to total supply vs current market cap. 

Someone else maybe able to give you an ELI5

Edit: your comment itself answers your first question "
Great idea. But the point that many are missing is that the puzzles that are solved computationally while mining is what actually helps keeps the transactions' integrity across the blockchain. So it's not just superfluous mining as I understand it and is functional. A more valid comparison would be comparing it to the entire work that operating a bank takes with the systems that enable cryptos to work. End of the day I don't know what to think of cryptos either.
SingularityNET
I agree mostly, but the reason people hold bitcoin is because they're speculating. If the usage for the currency is as small as you say, then the market cap should be way lower, but it isn't, the market's just speculative.

Maybe the market puts security and decentralization first. Not transactions.

"Instead of a centrally organised equity structure, people judge each other’s projects created on their own volition, and if it’s compelling it is rewarded.
