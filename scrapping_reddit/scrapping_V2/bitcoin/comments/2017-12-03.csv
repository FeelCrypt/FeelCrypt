...that would kill the market.
That is what I was getting at.
Markets hold, investors hodl.
Everyone has been calling a bubble for years. It still hasn't happened, and probably won't until the exact moment you buy in.
"I had a simple rule; if I was nervous or excited or worried or scared or in a rush I didnâ€™t buy. Or sell. If I was dead calm, bored even, and I still wanted to buy only then did I calmly pull the trigger. "
I don't get it either.
Can we get a meme with 13 from the show House when we get to 13k ?
"Oh you, that's a depression. A lot of coins coins would be hurt. 

Hypothetically, if  something happened and then the  NasDaq pulls BTC futures program. This would undermine, to put it lightly, consumer confidence in BTC and then even BTC could be thrown to the wolves during this depression. (This would do a lot of things BTC, but I am not trying write a novella and simply. Fell free to point out any errors.) It would become a competition of technology not flashy PR. (which BTC has gotten forcefully or not)

Big money likes ETH too much for it to fall though. ETH has the technology side down too; logically, ETH becomes the post depression leader."
Dear God. Don't even say things like that. We will have people offing themselves again.
Haha nice meme.
Nailed it!
"In general, I think BCH should probably wear a helmet because it is at risk of taking a tumble at anytime; however, it does look like BCH may have more than good months in December/January. (Expecially BTC crashes in particular if something of the mt.gox varity happens)"
If mt gox happens again. All coins will suffer.
It's actually not a bad idea to set stop losses, even when you are bullish.
Because they have never moved, so people think that there is a million coins missing from the supply... If the market found out that there is 1 million more bitcoin in supply than it thought it would have to adjust the price, it wouldnt matter in the long run tho.
Got me
Thanks for the info!
