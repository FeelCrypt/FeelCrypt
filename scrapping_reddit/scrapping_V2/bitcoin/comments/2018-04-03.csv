Forgive me, must have slipped my mind
That's a fair argument, I suppose. I do think some forms of charity are more effective than others though. In theory, if you just straight up gave some of your money to someone who has basically nothing, it would almost guarantee they would at least have somewhat of a better life.
That's the joke. You'll probably make more money investing in charity than in bitcoin

Not only that, but I guarantee you'll feel really good about yourself after donating to charity or volunteering. There's a definite emotional high associated with giving back.

Wrong. Individuals get deductions in the United States
"And then shockingly, creatures who are dependent on resources to survive and will expend the minimum possible effort to acquire them, will decide that not working and getting a free place to stay (rent being one of the larger expenses a person incurs regularly) is a better deal, so your ""real profit"" ends up decimating productivity and economic output while almost certainly costing taxpayers *more* in the long run.

No, homeless people should be helped, but that help should come with strings attached."
Giving them an apartment won't prevent their drug abuse and constant lawbreaking.
"This presents a tragedy of the commons / extended prisoner's dilemma - type scenario. Even if charity is good for the society overall, nothing guarantees that you (as the person donating) get to rent the apartment. The benefit might go to anybody, or diffusely to everybody. You as the player have little incentive to donate.

It's like planting more apple trees to the garden where everybody (including you) gets their fruits from. When you divide the gain by the number of people benefitting, you'll find that your likely gain might not be worth the effort. Even though everybody would benefit if everybody used some of their time to plant more fruit trees. Personal gains != global gains."
This is a viable start to a solution, trouble is, a large portion of the working and middle class *hate* homeless. The problem is so out of control and the stigmas of mental illness and drug addiction are so that its unlikely the situation can garner sympathy for those who have written off the homeless as sub-human after watching their neighborhoods deteriorating as more transients are about.
Like new sunglasses and a hat. Gotta be sun smart when you're working outside friends. 
"But that's not how you do it, you can't do tax fraud with cash donations.

You spend $1 million building a home, then get your buddy to value the property at 5 million. Then you donate the home to the charity and put 5 million as a tax deduction. So instead of paying (50% of 5 mill) 2.5 million dollars in tax, it only costs you the 1million you used to build the house. The charity can't sell the property for 5 mill, they only get 1 mill for it. But they dont mind because it's still free money for them, so they wont run to the IRS about it.

You are happy because you save 1.5 mill in tax. Your buddy is happy because he gets a fee and maybe even a percentage of the sale as the real estate agent. The charity is happy because they get 1 mill from the sale. But the government and the rest of the public aren't happy because you just cheated them out of 2.5 million that probably should have gone towards things like schools and fixing roads.

80% of your charity donation is actually administrative fees, salaries, marketing and tv ads. Very little of the money you give goes to those in need. If you want to help, get active about it. Seek a transparent way to give your time or skills for free to a small local organization.
Charities are an industrial complex. Many of them are not in the business of eradicating problems, since they require those problems to exist for them to survive. Some do a lot of good (I regularly donate to the ACLU since the government will always try to erode the rights of its citizens). But you've got some big name players like the Red Cross that managed to build 6 houses in Haiti with $500M of donations for disaster relief. You have companies like Goodwill that pay disabled people peanuts to work there and sell stuff other people gave them for free, while keeping many actual good donated products. You also have Wounded Warrior Project, and Susan G Komen, which are basically PR marketing departments of the NFL. Everyone aware of breast cancer, why don't you spend some of your money trying to cure it, or at least make it more manageable?

"I agree with you that many charities squander money or outright hoard it and that just reinforces the truth that blindly throwing money at a problem won't solve it.  On a similar vein, if one does donate to a charity then it's important to choose what you believe to be the best use of your money.  If someone simply donates blindly that indicates to me that charity to them is just a feel good gesture.

That being said, I firmly believe that we have a moral obligation to share our resources with those who are in need.  The fact that there will always be negative consequences to human actions does not negate the fact that we can greatly lessen the suffering of others at a negligible cost to ourselves.  $10 a month is probably trivial to most of the people reading this but that could easily make a life and death difference to someone who can be reached by a charity organization.  Whether that directly goes towards food and shelter or helps fund efforts to combat disease, an amount of money so trivial as to not even count as a sacrifice can literally save lives.  If you can save a life at no cost to your happiness or well being then I believe you have a moral obligation to do so.

Come to think of it, cryptocurrencies might be an effective way to ensure that charitable donations are actually used as they should be.  Being able to track the money through the blockchain would allow for the kind of transparency that charity organization should have.  (I know that there are charities that accept bitcoin but I haven't looked into any of them.)  The need for intermediaries could be greatly reduced, increasing the portion of donations that actually go towards the services vs the expenses of running the charity.  I think if people had greater confidence that the money they donate is used in the way that they want it to be used then many more people would donate.  Cryptocurrencies could make a huge difference in that regard and better enable human generosity."

"**Charitable gift annuity**

A charitable gift annuity is a gift vehicle that falls in the category of planned giving. It involves a contract between a donor and a charity, whereby the donor transfers cash or property to the charity in exchange for a partial tax deduction and a lifetime stream of annual income from the charity. When the donor dies, the charity keeps the gift.

The amount of the income stream is determined by many factors including the donor's age and the policy of the charity.

Then you get fired for being late and you lose $10,000 worth of income before you get a new job and you take a pay cut and your life sucks now.

"> If you theoretically gave the money directly to someone who is starving - would that not be morally superior?

Will you also give them food for the next time period when they are starving? 

If it was a natural disaster, perhaps some kind of one time scenario, then yes, absolutely, donate. 

But you make be making their situation worse with the donation otherwise. Food aid shuts down a countries agriculture, heightening dependence, empowering dictators, and ultimately starving more people than  before the food aid.

Those who are philanthropic often overlook the indignity of being given something for nothing; and it is bad for so many reasons while at the same time it causes dependence. Giving food is morally the same as the gift of a free shot of heroin from a drug dealer. (at least the drug dealer is self-aware)

There is a true test of when it is moral to donate: when you could reasonably expect the person to pay you back the full amount. At other times, its is jingoistic and patronizing at best, and horribly cruel at worst.

People need the dignity of supporting themselves, of standing on their own two feet and earning what they receive. When you take that away from them, it is harmful.

> they would be guaranteed to spend all that money, driving the economy

This is incorrect; not all spending is the same. Look at the broken window fallacy for an example of why.

Charity spending is not good for the economy in the way that food spending from earned income is. Food charity is a form of economic warfare. 

When you buy some product, any kind of valuable product that you see value in, you are driving the economy in a healthy sustainable fashion. When you give money to charity, you pervert and distort incentives, and ultimately harm the people you are trying to help.

To be clear: I am absolutely in favor of charity to help overcome exceptional temporary circumstances.

"> That's a very pessimistic view of human nature and motivation.

I mean, maybe, but I do think it's accurate.  We're animals, not these turbo-exceptional beings that we like to think we are.  Yes, we are the universe experiencing itself - we're also just animals who overthink and eat and poop like the rest of them, and I don't think biologists have *ever* recorded a scenario wherein animals, who come into a surplus of resources, don't then immediately consume those resources and then face famine and death.

>There are a small number of people who are happy with the minimum amount possible in life, but generally people want more than that. The most popular product is rarely the cheapest option.

Right, but we're not talking about ""cheap,"" we're talking about ""free,"" which we irrationally (or, perhaps *quite* rationally, depending on how you look at it) overvalue.  Like the example of animals over consuming available resources, I would add to that that we have very few experiences of some good or service being artificially priced at below the market rate that doesn't get over consumed.

You give *x* million people an option to have free housing, and some of those people simply will avail themselves of that option.  My bet?  An increasing percentage of that population will take it, year after year after year, costing more and more.  Then you have a permanent class of people who get to live for free (supported by people who *don't* get to live for free - where is the fairness in this relationship) and who will protect that economic windfall in the voting booth (entirely rationally, at that)."

This is why things like assistance for the homeless, free education, and healthcare need to be better presented as the cost savings initiatives they are, rather than expensive charity.
You lost me at $1 million.
You have to file a qualified appraisal with the deduction, which you‚Äôd never be able to obtain. Moreover the charitable donee needs to sign off on the value, which they wouldn‚Äôt. This is probably the most simplistic criminal tax fraud I‚Äôve seen reduced to words. Good job.
"There's also the one I would do.

Instead of giving your child money, you set up a non profit, put them in charge, donate, and they get paid a salary but you get an income deduction in that amount."
Because Bitcoin is volatile and these people are putting away money that can't lose 30% of its value overnight
Out of curiosity, what kind of banks are we talking about if one would want to hide their money? 
And a better society. 
FBAR filing is pretty easy... probably takes 15 minutes to complete once a year.
Only need to file the FBAR if you are over $10,000. Also, don't the Swiss have nameless debit cards and promote privacy?
"Switzerland has many double taxation and money laundering agreements with multiple countries. I think most EU counties have some sort of agreement with Switzerland and if they ask if you have money in Swiss banks they will have to supply that information.

Swiss is not that good place if you want to avoid tax."
"That's a pretty crass generalization. As one of the rare surviving members of the US middle class, I can tell you that I don't hate any homeless, poor, or anyone considered to be ""lower class"" than me. What I, and many in a similar position as me, don't like is the idea of working hard, living paycheck to paycheck, and then having someone who doesn't work (for whatever reason) take away from that paycheck. I work for my healthcare, pay for continuing education so I can get a better job, and oh by the way I have to feed, clothe, and keep the lights on for my family in the meantime. Whether they can't or won't work is irrelevant to me, the bottom line is they don't. It's not that I'm unsympathetic or uncaring, I just care far more about the welfare of me and mine than a homeless stranger. My contribution to society keeps them alive, and if there's a better, cheaper way to do that I'm all for it, but stop saying one group arbitrarily hates another based on your own opinion."
">  people of my nationality

Care to share that nationality friendo?"
"No one asked what the best way to get more money is.  The question was whether they should invest 10% of their money in Bitcoin.

The answer is totally reasonable.  Invest in a better world, instead.

Personally, I'm using Bitcoin to increase the monetary value of my non-profit funding.  So I'm doing both."
"I think a better simile/metaphor/whatever it's called would be ""If I ask where the best place to get a steak is I don't want to be told I should give the money for it to the homeless.""
"
"Directly helping people who have a spot of bad luck is one thing; but generically helping people who are not self sufficient seldom solves a problem and often makes it worse. 

Food aid is ironically one of the greatest sources of starvation. 

The best ""charity"" and the most moral way to spend your money to buy things you like, and to earn your money fairly for good work. A person who buys a yacht or luxury car feeds countless workers and encourages life sustaining industry and good habits. 

Paying someone for a job well done is strictly better than simply giving them money; it doesnt create dependence and it gives them the pride of earning rather than the shame of subsidy.

Charity is morally inferior to simple spending."
The picture of the person looks like a 12 year old kid... I highly doubt they were making a joke. Even if they were, it was poorly executed because it wasn't clear it was a joke. It seems more like some 12 year old with no concept of money just virtue signalling.
It's worth it in the long run since it makes money
Like bitcoin will ever be used as a currency, at the rate the price fluctuates there are literally no chance of it ever being used this way.
He literally throws technology into pools. sometimes fills an entire pool with coke and flies drones into it
"It's a business expense for his video production so it's not ""wasting money"" in the purest sense."
Literally any skill you have you can do for another person is worth something. That's why Walmart sees value in hiring people to say bye as you leave the store. 
They go to public works projects, and social programs.  I feel like I get a good return out of it.
I used to think that, but a selection of ETFs beat the market consistently by acting like mutual funds and switching which portion of the companies in an exchange they are invested in.
"Maybe my coins aren't looking as good right now as they were in December, okay? :P lol
Yeah, so maybe a little defensive. "
It's not zero sum because the whale wanted dollars more than you did (positive), you wanted bitcoin more than he did (positive), and you're sharing information about that trade with the market (positive). Win _win_ win.
All homeless people are law breaking drug addicts?
"That's a very pessimistic view of human nature and motivation.

There are a small number of people who are happy with the minimum amount possible in life, but generally people want more than that. The most popular product is rarely the cheapest option."
This is retarded. You know that right? Giving money to a child is not income to the child, but paying them comp from a non-profit is ordinary income to them. Even if the parent nets out their taxes through the contribution, the same amount of tax is paid. Also, there is no need for the charity because the parents could deduct compensation either way.
"Fthat is a tremendous idea...I wish my parents were that ""outside the box"" raising me..."
"When they get paid salary there is a tax on the labor. One can't simply pay salary without the tax burden on it.

It make sense only when the taxes on salaries are less than taxes on your income you donate to the foundation."
"Can't argue on that. That's absolutely true.
But on the other side,
Even cash or currency issued by government is also a liquid where it loses its value over a long period of time. What's worth 10$(let's say a 100 litter of petrol1990)now could worth far less I'm distant future(now only 10liter for 10$).
Bitcoin is bounded by it's algorithm Wich predict possible possible increase in value.
So if the investment is done in currency issued by government will loss it's called overtime. On the other side Bitcoin is only as valuable as much we value it Wich can be unpredictable."
Panama, Seychelles, Hong Kong, Singapore all fly under the radar better than Switzerland.
Lmfao why would you even have an offshore account with less than $10,000
"Fine... but... don‚Äôt tell anyone...

"That's _realllly_ stretching ""invest"" beyond what the guy obviously meant, though. A donation will have almost no benefit on his life relative to actually investing it."
"If you theoretically gave the money *directly* to someone who is starving - would that not be morally superior?

You are spending on luxuries if you have a lot of money. It does drive the economy, but that money spent anywhere would do that. If you gave it directly to someone who is destitute, they would be guaranteed to spend all that money, driving the economy, but it would arguably be spent for a better cause as they would now not be starving.

I think a payment system like Bitcoin makes this scenario all the more realistic."
Destruction never creates. The town is poorer by one broken window.
Agreed. It's *supposed* to be used as a currency (but deflationary currencies don't sound like a good idea, imo) but people are using it as an investment. (and it's not a particularly good investment)
That‚Äôs not the goal. Getting back our common spaces and saving $90k a year per homeless person is the goal. I DGAF if they sit in their free apartment high off their ass 24/7 as long as we spend less money on them.
"90% goes to lame crap, from what I can tell.  And the rest has the most insane gatekeeping out there.  The bureaucracy to get obvious basic needs (a human right) like food, housing, education, etc. is so heartbreaking that many give up.  Non-profits end up doing the work that the government should be doing.

At least in the US."
"I think the what-the-fuck-is-wrong-with-you-people mentality comes from the general sentiment of 'you might as well not donate' which is lazy and selfish. 

The narrative should be 'do your research and give to a worthy charity' not 'don't bother'. "
That person can go on to reproduce and their children can die unless if the systemic issues are solved. Also the person that didn't get malaria may now die of HIV or malnourishment in Africa instead. If Africa becomes developed they will get healthcare and better quality of living and more sanitation etc., which seems like the best way to me. Todo that though you need a stable government and currency even if done philanthropically, so probably just use USD if you can but I don't think there is a stable enough government and society anywhere, you'd have to create one first or make do with something like Egypt and expand from there.
It wouldn't as increase in quality of life leads to decrease in birth rate.
That's why you gotta donate double what you were initially gonna donate. In case your first donation creates super-hitler, you need to donate again to create super-Jesus to defeat super Hitler. It's simple math guys
This is excellent! I'd support AMF for their logic. Unlike vaccines which can have a limited effectiveness, these nets get at the core issue.
It's hard enough to get away from THIS net, but if I lived in North Dakota (I've been there in July, not fun!) those nets can be given a real test. Maybe the summertime in Alaska's arctic zone is worse.
The main malaria spreading mosquitos feed at night, so having a net over your bed is very effective.
There‚Äôs a gaming rig inside the net. 
Typical Bill Gates, betting against the net again.

"Which ones?

I'm sceptical, by definition among active managers you're always going to have a spread of outliers on both sides of the average, so you will have things that appear to be 'consistent' and a proven system, but over time you end up with a reversion to the mean. I recall there being studies which included notable funds with a long track record of success, that after many decades suddenly had a reversion to the mean."

"This reminds me of a comment on a Yahoo news article (I know, I know) from quite a while ago, before McDonalds had done all their renovations. The article was outlining their plans and how much it was gonna cost (in the billions, of course) and some dumbass was like ""think of how much they could've done if they donated that instead of wasting it on renos"". I'm like they didn't burn it or spend it on a yacht u fuckwit they're expecting to earn it back, the renos are an investment. Anyway this almost got long but yeah, shits dumb"
For those who invested around 19k a tax deduction could have been better . . .
look at that fucking kids picture i wanna punch him in the face
Not if your investing in Karma.
Unless that charity goes on to do great things for you in the future. Like donating to s children's cancer find then years later have a child with cancer that benefits from the charity. 
Well, I don't mean to tell the obvious but the idea is you're investing in a better society/planet. Or are people dumb enough to not understand the point behind charity?
I feel like investing in bitcoin is(also) the opposite of an investment, and also not the way bitcoin should work
You‚Äôre investing in the CEOs bank account 
You'll probably wind up with more money in the long run. 
Considering this was end of October and assuming he didn't sell during the ATH charities might have been the better investment due to tax write-offs.

if everyone who experienced some moonage donated to charity, bitcoins reputation would improve from where it currently stands: as a pet project of white guys and criminals."
No bro, you invest in the charities and then they become more able to collect free money from people.

You're throwing away money either way but at least with charity you are benefitting someone.
thats literally is the opposite of investing 
I'd say it's a good investment if you give the money to a cancer charity. But only if you're planning on getting cancer in the future. 
Trump Foundation was even better, their owner even got himself a dinner with Salma Hayek from the donations.
It depends on what you want the return to be. Investing in charities gives a longer run return of a better society. 
you can give me 10% of your money, i provide the same return rate as btc.
It's valid to invest in a better tomorrow
Investing into better future
You are if your investing into the betterment of mankind.

Bitcoin is such a popular alternative investment in today's time but as much as it is promising there's also some good amount of risks involved and I believe one should first go through these risks prior to getting into any investment.  Just saying..
No matter what do you do, which involving money, there is always an unhappy party that wish to see you get burned

Haha at least with a charity you invest in needy as opposed bitcoin witch donates your hard-earned cash to a whale. At this stage it is a zero sum game. 
"It's only the opposite if it decreases the value of existing investments.  I don't think charity does that.  Charity incrementally increases the value of investments.  If nothing else, it provides direct security and a sort of folk insurance policy, because people go out of their way for other people they perceive to be ""nice"" or ""good."""
Investing is better than cure :)
10% in charities would be a good means of a tax write off....up to a point
Take that you smug duck.
"Donating to charity is an investment in humanity.

You'll probably never see the return, and even if there is one it'll be minute - yet you will have made someone's life a little bit easier, you will have helped someone stay above water just for few more moments, so they can breath a little easier and keep themselves afloat for that much longer."
Investing is better than cure 
It is tax deductible though, and right now that's probably a lot more valuable than a shillcoin.
Investing in a better world is really the only type of investing that's worthwhile.

It can get very scary when TV commercials have warnings for mutual funds ‚Äòbeing subjected to market risks‚Äô. But they are definitely a lot less overwhelming when you have your goals in place.

Not all charities work for a better future for humanity. Sadly enough, charity money can destroy the local economy if applied the wrong way. 
I think the investments hes thinking of are the ones in which he will be able to bask in the shade of.
Give 10% of your savings to charity every year and they will have money for a decade. Invest your savings in an asset that makes 10% per year and give them the profits and they will have money forever.
"Youd be upset to find out that a lot of charities actually dont do much for the future of humanity compared to how much they do for the presence of their big bank accounts 

And there comes the question what is the future of humanity ? ALS raised millions that helped thousands of people yet that same millions couldve helped millions of Africans from death (not just a disease , although a horrible one). 

We as humans are always trying to ‚Äòsave‚Äô the world. The world‚Äôs falling apart & there will always be negative consequences to certain human/nature events that will continue on until the end of Earth. 

If you do donate I just hope you make sure that money is allocated correctly. May I insert a [recommendation](https://reg-charity.org) for a seriously well intentioned foundation started by poker players where the objective is to maximize lives saved vs dollar spent. Youd think all charities would optimize their allocation of funds like this but A LOT dont & even if they did in a lot of cases charities receive donations out of sympathy & although American lives w diseases are improved/cured, the impact could be much more substantial. "
"It's in society's best interest NOT to give to charity. If you purchase stock from a company that money goes to a private business that uses the money to grow the economy by employing people and providing services to clients. You're giving the money to hardworking men & women who will improve upon it and provide a return.

Charities and government programs (Medicaid, Social Security, education loans, etc...) give money to unproductive people who spend it on food, medicine, etc... These people don't produce much. The private sector isn't perfectly efficient at allocating capital to where it will be used most productively, but it's miles ahead of private charities and government. It feels really good to give to charity, but you have to realize that you're hurting society as a whole when you do it.

Now, if my brother was in trouble and needed help I'd TOTALY give to him and help him get back on his feet. I'd just say to myself ""I'm hurting society a little bit to do this, as there is a more producive us of my time & money, but I don't care because he's my brother."" But to systematically allocate money to charity is a net drain on society."
But they probably liked gardening anyways
Kiva is great!
No, there's a difference between Kiva loans and Kiva donations, you don't get the donations back except as tax deductions, like JeremyLinForever wrote about donations in general. However, Kiva loans can have a return via credit card rewards, e.g. /r/churning.
The returns are more human than any of you. 
10+% gain depending on your incom level and if it drops you to a lower tax bracket.
Next to none
It's tax deductible actually so whatever your tax rate is.

"I get this is a joke; but, much better than you might think.

Conservation Easements.  Typical ratios I see are around 4-5 to 1, meaning you 'invest' 100k in Dec. and save your marginal rate on 400k-500k on April 15th.  Assume a 40% blended fed/state rate for a total tax savings of 160k on the low side.  60% return on your charitable deduction in about 4 months. We do a lot of these.

link below references a 9 to 1 ratio which is a bit on the scammy side.

In terms of impact, a study by RAND concluded that for every $1 spent on education in particular, the cascading affects of having higher education was $7 saved for the district. So, seeing the returns as lower crime, less people in jail, more generally educated populous, less taxes needed to pay for the mistakes of those less educated, etc.

Depends on the charity. Drunk charity auction winning bids can get you an off season stay in the Ozarks. Contribution to Trump library can get you a cabinet post. Donation to the Stormy Daniels defense fund gets you a lap dance.
Yes, but consider the following: You could invest $100 in a charity, or you could invest $100 in an ETF watch it double six times within 18 years, and then give $6400 to charity.
I've been hiding seeds. Is that kinda the same?

Charity is an ineffective way to help anyone.
No but someone telling someone else to give their money away to charity is a bit rich. Especially when they were asking how to invest it.
Except that it isn't. Unless your definition on investing is buying high and selling low in which case Bitcoin wouldn't be alone in that assessment. 
Little bit worse than Bitcoin.

"If you are doing it in lieu of charity, why would you charge interest at all.

And no they are largely not able to access global capital markets, for a great number of reasons. I think the biggest one is the nature of the money systems we use: They are artificially constrained by national borders.

Anyway; if you could overcome said barriers, and make an investment in people instead of dropping a charity bomb, I think that would benefit them more.

Really slow but tangible. Programs like SNAP (food stamps) have a net positive effect on the economy. Ever dollar spent by the program generates 1.25 of economic activity in the community. 
Your returns are in the form of tax deductions
"‚Äò it costs $7500 through the Against Malaria Foundation (AMF) to prevent one malaria-related death.

"> what are the returns like?

Depends how old you are. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charitable_gift_annuity"
Invest in starting a charity, then just sell everything people donate to you. Less 10% of course.
Think a little broader. Returns aren't in dollars, they're in improvement of a social problem or humanitarian issue. It's hard to measure, but I will say this: if you make the world better for everyone, you make it better for yourself.
I don't know, making people's lives better seems like a pretty fucking good return on my charity investment.
A better society for all, so minimal as your return is spread amongst all citizens.   
Long-term, they approach infinity. Short-term, somewhat less. 
Society literally expands when resources are spread more evenly
Pretty good. The charity I donated to set up a clinic that detected an illness before it became terminal. So whatever a life's worth in dollars. 
If it can solve a problem like homelessness or crime in your area and raise property prices then pretty well. Isn't that why americans think they only need a tiny government with little to no welfare as they give to charities they like to change society
Better than investing in Bitcoin these days.
"For example you can walk down the street more safely, therefore you are avoiding being robbed or going to the hospital.

The return equals to what you save, a true long period investment."
About the same as crypto 
Some people may have another meal for one more day. 
Donating is obviously just giving money away but charity can be profitable both legitimately non profit and creating tons of jobs or the criminal way by scamming people donating to a charity and stealing from those that could have used that money for it's intended use. 
Good if you're the CEO
Karmic.
I‚Äôve thought about taking a grand or so out of savings, dumping $100 or so into all of the volatile non-bc cryptocurrencies, and hoping for the best.
Charities are all scams anyway. 
why 10% not a 50% who invented it?
Ask The Robin Hood Foundation. They have metrics. But the investment is in *society*.
