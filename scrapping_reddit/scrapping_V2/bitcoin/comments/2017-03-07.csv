I have watched a lot of Terry's youtube vids only to try and follow his stream of consciousness style coding and ideas. I fail most of the time but I always understand a little more about him and then I get sad because he's a genius trapped in his limiting circumstances.

Really what he pulled off with this hobby OS is fantastic and in the true spirit of tinkering and playing with computers. This man is awesome. You can easily ignore the religious aspect."
"Oh man, I can't wait for Terry to read blogs about the ""CIA niggers"" and their modern world sacrileges. This guy is always surprisingly entertaining."
He sounds like he is about to break down, crying haha
I watched a livestream of terry's once and he downloaded the same executable that he wrote from both wget and firefox and they had different  MD5 checksums.  He then went on a paranoid rant about cia NWORDS.  At the time I chalked it up to his schizophrenia but now I'm starting to wonder.

The article says the CIA had several zero day exploits and never notified the manufacturer. So MS wouldn't exactly know about it if the CIA found the exploit first prior to MS being able to discover it. 
"Depends on how good the CIA is at hiding it, I guess. I'm not saying Microsoft definitely wasn't involved, just that it is possible that they weren't. 

Edit: According to the leak, they can do all of this without leaving a footprint. So it's very possible that Microsoft wasn't involved."
">  Wouldn't Microsoft know immediately 

How would they, if the bad update is only served to one victim?"
Or, you know, they wanna do business with/in the US.
lmao ok. Siemens? Nokia? Sony? Samsung? 
An exploit of some form that is unknown to the vendor or creator of the software or hardware. It's generally the most 'valuable' exploit type. 
Sure, I'm just pointing out that Microsoft doesn't need to be complicit for the CIA to use their operating system to spy on people.

The point isn't that you are checking every update, it's that you can. If the US government wants to slip an exploit into Windows, all they need to do it coerce Microsoft and give them a gag order.

If they want to get an exploit into Debian, they need to get it right by everyone who will look at the patch. You *can* do this, of course. There are subtle bugs that can be introduced if people aren't paying close attention. But I'd take the system that's harder to put an exploit in if given the chance."

Yeah does this news shock anyone these days? PRISM was like 5 years ago. The government can and will get all the info they want on you for whatever reason they care to. It's reasonable to assume that whatever tech they have behind closed doors at the NSA/DoD is decades ahead of the consumer devices we have access to as well so counter measures are probably more of a speed bump than a road block

"I think it's mainly that people feel more powerless when it's the US doing it. There is no person, no institute, no nation, no world power that could possibly do anything about it.

The US is so overwhelmingly powerful that they cannot be held accountable for wars fought in full view of the world's press, let alone covert, digital data gathering.

Only internal US politics could possibly change something about it, but the US public doesn't give a shit. I think that makes some people consider the US as a whole 'horrid'. Of course the reality is that any country with the resources will be doing this, but people feel they have less to fear from these less powerful nations."
"Mainly because those clowns are the only ones who have leaks at this magnitude.

The NSA leak, it only revealed the UKs involvement because an American Engineer (Edward Snowdon) leaked details of it.

I suspect British Intelligence has a hand in deeper shit than the CIA does, everything the NSA and CIA do at this point is just leaked. Incompetence... who knows. The MOSAD are as secretive as it gets.

You rarely see leaks in regards to the MOSAD & other Middle Eastern Intelligence Agencies, or the British & other European Intelligence Agencies."
"Because few people understand how old the problem is. Or just how savaged their privacy has been with no hard justifications given. You'll understand one day when the FBI shows up at your door step to tell you that you're under surveillance because of an ""anonymous online tip"".

I think you answered your own question.
That's the power of budget, my son. All the sexy government agencies (intelligence, special forces groups, etc) are given blank checks for their projects.
"You should read some of the press from the time of the Snowden leaks. It's a combination of legal, unique hardware, and brute force tools that complement typical cryptographic tech, which gives the NSA its edge. While they don't resort to the wrench as far as anyone knows, it's more like the old XKCD comic than not.  It's not ""crack this key, computer"", it's ""sign this other key, sir"". Gag orders and leverage from existing monetary entanglements are the big trump card. Corporations have too much money at stake to risk any of their revenue stream or missing quarterly goals on some legal fight that could existentially threaten those revenue streams. Joe Nacchio of Qwest exemplifies that (he was a criminal, and tried to exploit the secret information to do insider trading; they just pulled the secret rug out from under him and showed enough to the SEC to send him to jail; at that point, he was no longer interested in cooperating, so it's slightly out of order but goes to show how easy it is to lose in that confrontation). There was a large number of very straightforward hardware tools for spying; They sounds unrealistic for any normal person, but using gag orders, shipments would be intercepted and tampered with.

There is very rarely any opportunity to use a brute force directly against cryptography, but it's just not for lack of trying. Every time we read about some bug that needs to be patched, or some configuration peccadillo (key size, etc.) creating a cryptographic weakness, there's also probably some target that's unpatched, making another opportunity they can look at exploiting. There is massive storage dedicated to pitting last year's crypto vs. next year's hardware, too, so supposedly, they will be exploring old troves of encrypted information in the event that they are eventually able to.  That may or may not work but it doubles as a scare tactic to keep people from encrypting data."
I'm thinking more like a data center with 2 million consumer level graphics cards cracking passwords with Jack the Ripper.
It sounded like what metasploit does just with more 0 day 
Nice try,  NSA counter-intelligence officer.
Nope, I concur, he is correct. I worked at Ft Meade as well a couple years back, and they are almost on the level of consumer tech. 
 Most Federation planets are continuously monitored and scanned. 
I work for the Geek Squad at the Best Buy in Fort Meade, and one day James Clapper brought his laptop in.  There was nothing on it besides some kind of unusually advanced live-action video porn viewer.  Made it look like all the women were being filmed through shower heads or something.
On most modern phones you receive the phone as is. You aren't compiling open source code and installing it (with some you can't install any unsigned OS). The phone could very easily be backdoored from the get go. Do you trust your carrier and phone manufacturer to respect your privacy? 
Yeah. It's a messed up world we live in.

But what's the problem? Is it better that everyone else has these tools but we don't?
To be fair, the military have weapons that they could use to kill innocent American citizens but they don't just go around killing citizens. There is a big difference between ability and action, and there is zero proof of an illegal search and seizure taking place. Cyber warfare and espionage are absolutely a part of the world now, and that's never going away, so I'd be shocked to hear that the CIA didn't have custom tools for hacking. Do we honestly believe that other countries don't have similar tools?

Which is actually the thrust of the story.  OP is spinning a click bait title
Not sure where this rumor started, but no, private sector tech and government tech are on par with each other. I was a crypto linguist and spent some time at Ft Meade MD, primarily working with the NSA while I was enlisted.

"All orgs involved in strategically ""interesting"" security should've assumed complicit, in any country that has intelligence agencies The way it works is that the agencies approach the company, bind them under national security to not say anything to the n OK z, then make them an ""offer they can't refuse"".  For example, ""we'll make you the top dog in your industry, if you add this spyware for us."". They probably play hardball if you try to refuse, too. 

Long story short: it's not secure unless it's open source, you formally audit the source code, and compile it yourself.  That includes the compiler, the OS, the BIOS, and the hardware chips etc.

Yes, security is hard."
This has been blatantly obvious for some time now. You don't own you PC or the data on it. Microsoft has been trying to push its control over your property and this is the natural conclusion: then doling out your info.

"> Can activate backdoors on demand, including via Windows update

I haven't look in every files but so far, I don't see anything that suggests they could open a backdoor via Windows Update.        

Maybe I didn't look in the right place, but all I see about windows update is some technics to [list every installed patches](https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/cms/page_14587265.html), 1 guide to install a [difficult patch](https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/cms/page_44597270.html) and another to use windows update server on a [non-domain-joined windows workstation](https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/cms/page_13762930.html), (a trick you can find [on the web](https://community.spiceworks.com/topic/481986-windows-server-2012-r2-not-showing-in-wsus-3-2) .

Yes it's classified as ""secret"" but it hardly looks like a way to exploit a backdoor. You know what it looks like? Tricks and tips for windows users.         
Now ask yourself the question, what OS is installed on the CIA computers? What kind of OS are the 20,000 CIA employee the most familiar with? Archlinux? I don't think so.

edit: got the first link wrong, my bad."
Not necessarily. I mean, if they have the kind of capability to invade every computer in the world at will, I doubt they really need Microsoft's help to inject updates.
word around the valley at the time was it was a condition of letting Billy keep his company together in the anti-trust
I haven't looked into the story so there might be proof that they are complicit that I'm not aware of. In general though, Microsoft doesn't necessarily have to be complicit for this to happen. It's also possible that there is an exploit in the update system that allows it to be hijacked. [Flame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flame_(malware\)) was able to spread itself on local networks by hijacking the update system with a rogue certificate created through an MD5 hash collision for example.
"""Complicit""? Yeah, they did what any company in the entire world would do when the NSA/CIA tells them to do something. They did it.

What likely happened was that CIA/NSA found or bought a zero day, coded the trojan and then simply filed a motion disallowing Microsoft to do anything about it or talk about it. "
"As updates are signed by microsoft they'd need to ""obtain"" keys - one way or another..."
https://i.imgur.com/MvJRkCs.png From what I read there, none of these manufacturers were complicit or even knew that they had vulnerabilities, the CIA hoarded the vulnerabilities despite the Obama Administration asking for it to be released.

"self driving cars? yeah, right into that embankment! take that, activists, probably.

truly frightening."
Just one more reason I don't like computerized cars.
Buy a manual. 
"Even 5 years ago I would hand-wave you away as a nut.  

Given the configuration of ignition, throttle, steering, and braking, it would be *impossible* to assuredly cause a car to get out of control.  The experiment done by those two guys and the Jeep is totally invalid.  

That vehicle has a hard mechanical link between steering wheel and the rack, and a hydraulic ps system.  The brakes are mechanically linked, with a booster.  The throttle may be fly-by-wire but there is a mechanical ignition interlock you can control regardless of any computer.  There is a mechanical transmission linkage which can be controlled (put in Neutral) regardless of a computer.  There is a mechanical parking brake independent of the braking system which is completely independent and not electrical at all.  

As of today, the only thing I am sure of is that there is a mechanical rear parking brake on American automobiles.  All other assumptions are off: they in some way can be controlled by computer.  

So now, you're correct.  This is *very* recent on recent new automobiles, though."
Why do you think the US is the only one that has this capability? 
They have actually stopped a lot of terrorist attacks before they happened, to be fair.
"It's the ""needle in a haystack"" issue.

You can accws anything people use in computers, but how the fuck are you going to go through it all?"
Terrorist attacks are good for war profiteering. The government has no desire to stop that cash cow. 
Who says they want to stop terrorism?  If anything, more terrorist attacks that are carried out successfully allow them to petition more funding and the ability to do more stuff like this.  THIS IS WHAT THEY WANT.

The problem with hardware wallets is that they are a massive target for theft. Everyone using a hardware wallet has Bitcoin, but not everyone using an operating system has Bitcoin (in fact very few do), so you are able to blend in with the crowd more. It's a trade off. I'm not sure what's worse. I use Linux for now, but I can't decide if I should switch to hardware wallet or not. It's a tough call.
Pretty safe. Most use a burnt in boot loader that can't be altered. And firmware upgrades that have to be signed to get past that.

"IMO a dedicate coreboot + Gnu/Linux w/ fully encrypted SSD (including boot sector) laptop is more secure (b/c even its hardware is more auditable & open source than Trezor or Ledger Nano hardware).

Then follow best security practices (use ""stty -echo"", start every command with a space so that it's not logged to .bash_history, make. Also create separate users for every task (one user for handling the Bitcoind+Bitcoin-CLI, a separate user with sudo privilege, another user for any web-related activities, etc)."
"> In what is surely one of the most astounding intelligence own goals in living memory, the CIA structured its classification regime such that for the most market valuable part of ""Vault 7"" — the CIA's weaponized malware (implants + zero days), Listening Posts (LP), and Command and Control (C2) systems — the agency has little legal recourse.
> 
> The CIA made these systems unclassified.
> 
> Why the CIA chose to make its cyberarsenal unclassified reveals how concepts developed for military use do not easily crossover to the 'battlefield' of cyber 'war'.
> 
> To attack its targets, the CIA usually requires that its implants communicate with their control programs over the internet. If CIA implants, Command & Control and Listening Post software were classified, then CIA officers could be prosecuted or dismissed for violating rules that prohibit placing classified information onto the Internet. Consequently the CIA has secretly made most of its cyber spying/war code unclassified. The U.S. government is not able to assert copyright either, due to restrictions in the U.S. Constitution. This means that cyber 'arms' manufactures and computer hackers can freely ""pirate"" these 'weapons' if they are obtained. The CIA has primarily had to rely on obfuscation to protect its malware secrets.

One of the more interesting passages. The arsenal must not be classified to protect those who deploy it from legal action. This cyberwarfare kit, which can just as easily be used to destroy the US as one of its enemies, is public domain software created and released at US taxpayer expense.

&nbsp;

> The CIA's Remote Devices Branch's UMBRAGE group collects and maintains a substantial library of attack techniques 'stolen' from malware produced in other states including the Russian Federation.
> 
> With UMBRAGE and related projects the CIA cannot only increase its total number of attack types but also misdirect attribution by leaving behind the ""fingerprints"" of the groups that the attack techniques were stolen from.

This has interesting implications for the claim that ""Russians"" hacked the election (although I can't imagine the CIA wanting to hack the election in Trump's favour)."

You are right. Just download WSUS and you can push out your own Windows Updates. 
"Exactly, I saw the post and saw that it was ""breaking news"" and was just straight confused."
Right, but the mechanism of Microsoft Updates makes it a very obvious attack if they do it.  Wouldn't Microsoft know immediately and fix it if they weren't complicit?  There are people that review Microsoft Update initiated updates with a fine tooth comb, don't you think people would notice?
That's why releasing software pseudonymously is the wise thing to do for idealist developers.
"> ""Complicit""? Yeah, they did what any company in the ~~entire world~~ USA would do when the NSA/CIA tells them to do something. They did it.

Beyond that, is any of this even remotely surprising? Should we really be shocked that the CIA can and most likely has used software exploits for the purpose of spying or investigation? Isn't that the whole reason they exist?
Actually, you pose an excellent point. I hadn't thought of that.
"I think that it's because the NSA is supposed to be a safe barrier that is hard to get into. Any use of NSA data / tools is supposed to be authorized on a case by case basis for use by the CIA, so it would make sense that they'd rather have direct access to those kinds of tools without needing to authorize access to NSA tech.

I'm sure that the authorization process is lazy and not much of a barrier anyway, but this is my guess on why they'd want internal tech. Also, maybe there are plans to move NSA responsibilities over to CIA or something?"
"You say that, but 6 months ago if someone suggested that the CIA might have killed a journalist or investigator by controlling their car, you'd get a massive eye roll and tin foil hat comments.

As more of this boils up to the main stream, people will realize how plausible so much of the conspiracy shit really is.  Instead of mocking people, help spread it so people actually understand that it's legitimately happening."

His story, giving it a cursory view on wikipedia, is very similar to Hemingway's. spoiler: Hemingway was right, he was under surveillance by the FBI "
In favor of what? I think you're going to have to go with a fairly obscure OS to escape this stuff.
Linux will welcome you with open arms!
Might be safer, but what's to stop them from having backdoors in the BIOS or hardware level?  The fact is if the government wants to get to you, they will find a way.  They can just show up at your door and take your shit.  Also, they can force companies to put back doors in anyways, so who's to say they haven't already?
Fuck dude, after this, that does seem likely...
Apparently some emails that he sent a few days before his death said that he believed he was under FBI surveillance. 
That's not a new hypothesis at all. As soon as that story broke, [people thought this had happened](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/24/michael-hastings-car-hacked_n_3492339.html). Now, I'm not familiar with how they'd go about this hacking, but back in 2013, the consensus (in the public sector, it should be said) was that remote controlling most cars, Merc C250 included, would be impossible without physical interaction and less practical/effective than sabotaging the car in traditional ways. I'm still not convinced by the facts we have and the intel in the WikiLeaks dump since there's no proven connection.

Sensationalism on the Internet has become too common. There's not much than can be done about it except for rolling your eyes when you see titles like this.
"Yeah exactly. When news like this breaks there is so much early spin from all sides. I always fall into the trend of coming to Reddit and reading about it, when there's tons of people spinning it every which way. 

Gonna wait for the dust to settle on this one. But really it doesn't seem like anything surprising, or even shocking. Every sophisticated government has this most likely. It's going to be a never ending tech arms race. I can either worry about it endlessly, or take a few extra precautions and enjoy my life. "
The NSA is like a communications, hacking and electronic warfare oversight group.  They develop the methods and procedures that other agencies like the CIA, FBI and military intelligence use to do actual investigation and espionage.  So at least in theory, I don't believe the NSA is supposed to be doing its own spying, rather it supports the other spy agencies and provides the best tools and services it can.
