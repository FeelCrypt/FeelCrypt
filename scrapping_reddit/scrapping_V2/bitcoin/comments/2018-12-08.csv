I bet you're a blast at parties.
You do know that there are trading bots constantly scanning reddit comments for sentiment analysis and then making trades based off that?
Nah, this is nice and funny. Memes don’t control the world. Sorry you’re upset by it. I can relate for sure. The derp HODL memes hurt these days LOL. Strong hands my friends strong hands.
Collective stupidity like not raising the blocksize and handing everything over to Blockstream?
"Everyone that thinks it's going to the moon is just hoping for another hype bubble to happen.  Those that lost fiat bought the hype bubble.  No sympathy.  It's always been a high risk asset with no actual value attached.  Those who don't understand the risk shouldn't be investing.  

Now that said, I want bitcoin to succeed.  I think it's a real product and has a real future as a currency.  That won't happen on a widespread scale until it stops being a volatile asset people are trying to get rich on.  I would like the price to drop and stabilize.  

It's true that it's viable as a deflationary currency.  But then it's value should be far far less than where we are now.  Bitcoins deflation rate should not, cannot, be higher than every other investment.  Holding currency should not be more profitable long term than any other investment.  THAT is why there is massive risk.  THAT is why there was a bubble, and in my opinion, still a bubble.  If it doesn't stabilize and gain widespread usage, it'll continue to drop until it's worthless. 

Just my two cents.  I'm sure it'll gain all the downvotes because I want crypto to succeed and not just make me rich overnight.  "
Collective stupidity is what caused the bubble in the first place
Isn’t everything about internet videos now?

"Five reasons:

1. The closer you spend it to the time that you get it, the less important the volatility is.  Sure, it costs a lot more BTC now to buy groceries than it did a year ago, but I also make more BTC every paycheque, because my pay (just like the price of groceries) is denominated in euro, not bitcoin.
2. Look at the dates... I got back in to bitcoin in 2011.  Coins I acquired then are still thousands of times more valuable at the moment than when I got them.  What used to be ""leftover change"" of ""a few BTC"" is now a serious amount of money.
3. I have never engaged in speculation, trying to trade my BTC back and forth with different currencies in the hope of increasing how much I have.  I know that it's possible to make money that way, but it's also possible to lose a lot, and I suspect I wouldn't be very good at it, so would likely lose far more than I make, so I simply don't do it.
4. Although I don't see Bitcoin as an investment (but rather a currency), that doesn't mean that I don't have investments.  I own a house (no mortgage) in another country and have a portfolio of traditional stocks in companies that I both agree with morally/politically as well as see as being likely to increase in value over time (on average, they absolutely have).  If I ever find myself having a lot of money lying around (note that for me, that means BTC), I'll generally funnel it in to either these existing investments or make a new investment.
5. I have a good job (six figures p.a. in euro/dollar terms).

a) it's about 1,000,000x overvalued

b) there are better coins than bitcoin that do the same thing (anonymous transactions) but better, but they're not getting any traction because this shitcoin is what media and companies hear about.

If you think Bitcoin is worth even close to as much as it is right now, then compare how much share of the network you're getting by having 1 bitcoin to 1 share of Apple and compare the prices."

It was 2011 when I realised what bitcoin *really* is, but I didn't get back in to mining.  I just starting buying and using it.  In 2016, I started switching as much as possible to bitcoin as a currency and I've now only got a few things left that I need to hold fiat to pay and I'm actively working on fixing those.

(to note: I do pay for quite a lot of things with fiat out of necessity, but for the vast majority of it, it's using a credit card that I then pay off in bitcoin, so I don't actually have to *hold* fiat to do so.  When and where possible, I do *prefer* to pay bitcoin directly to someone accepting it though, so I do my best to encourage adoption.  My landlord takes it for rent, and a small market in the village I live in takes it for groceries.)"

"**Sunk cost**

In economics and business decision-making, a sunk cost is a cost that has already been incurred and cannot be recovered (also known as retrospective cost).

Sunk costs are sometimes contrasted with prospective costs, which are future costs that may be incurred or changed if an action is taken. In that regard, both retrospective and prospective costs could be either fixed costs (continuous for as long as the business is in operation and unaffected by output volume) or variable costs (dependent on volume). However, many economists consider it a mistake to classify sunk costs as ""fixed"" or ""variable."" For example, if a firm sinks $400 million on an enterprise software installation, that cost is ""sunk"" because it was a one-time expense and cannot be recovered once spent.

Bitcoin transactions aren't anonymous. 
"Bitcoin's price as reported is arbitrary. In the code the fundamental unit is the satoshi. There is no ""bitcoin"" in the code. For cosmetic reasons only on the GUI of the original client, the decimal was placed where it is making 1btc = 100,000,000sat. And it simply became convention.

Think of it this way, if you buy $1 of bitcoin today are you buying 0.00029940 bitcoin or 29,940 satoshis? It's arbitrary where you decide to place the decimal. And thus the equivalent price is arbitrarily dependent on the units you choose to display.

You saying it's a million times overvalued is the literall equivalent of saying someone's too tall because you reported their height in nanometers. 

If you want to compare bitcoin to a stock, then you need to compare the price of the fundamental units. In terms of satoshis the price of bitcoin is $0.0000334 per today.

Personally I've been using the millibit (0.001btc = 1mBTC) for a few years because that's roughly equivalent to everyday values of things and stocks. The last ATH cycle saw the price go from $0.20 mBTC to $19 mBTC and back to $3.35 mBTC. Will we see a $100 mBTC in the future? Not unreasonable at all to think so."
"> If you think Bitcoin is worth even close to as much as it is right now

Not sure it should be worth less than the cost to generate it... so your claims of overvaluation are a bit silly.

After a while people started to lose interest and the Bitcoin train lost it's steam. It wasn't being talked about or mentioned as much hence the decline in interest and price. Nowadays it seems like a fad which has passed.
