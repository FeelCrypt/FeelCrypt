"Easily the best financial decision many of us ever made.
If your in the red, it by default means you got in around nov-feb. Just know that for nearly 10 years there have been repeated times where people bought at a recent top and 100% of the time the price of Bitcoin has always come back to smash through the previous all time high price. Every single time since the start of Bitcoin.

Anyone in the red just needs to be patient and in time you will be in the green. We will celebrate at a meetup around the next halving:)
