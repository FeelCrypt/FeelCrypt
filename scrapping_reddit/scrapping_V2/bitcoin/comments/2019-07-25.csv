The same reason why MLMs, cults and ponzi schemes get people to dump money into them, the dream that you will get great gains from spending money into them, and hoping that it might be enough to dig you out of whatever hole you feel like you're in.

If this is true... Then why bother spending any money whatsoever. Go back in time further to when you could still mine Bitcoin with a home PC. In its infancy you could mine several Bitcoin every few days. Or if you were lazy, purchase Bitcoins for a few dollars each.

Otherwise you can withdraw it into a LN Bitcoin wallet. Blue Wallet is the easiest to start while you learn."
Still looks like it's falling.
Shoulda DCA'd
You’ve held since then? Or didn’t buy at 3K to even it out?
"You'll need a LN capable hot wallet. I use Lightning Labs' lightning Android wallet since it's noncustodial. Blue Wallet is easier and superior, but it's custodial.

Blue Wallet hooks you up to their own network so you can instantly withdraw/send. Lightning Labs you have your own wallet and need to set up your own channel. A bit more difficult, but you'll control it.

I'd recommend blue wallet to start."

"It's some Bitcoin on the lightning network, a way to zap Bitcoin around fast and free.

The Blue Wallet app can get you started super fast. If you want to make your own network channels, there's tons of other great mobile wallets as well, like eclair and Lightning Labs wallets.

The lightning network (LN) is a scaling solution for Bitcoin. Good thing to read up on!"
"Market cap is an idiot metric for people without understanding of how this market works. It is not good, neither is it bad, it's just normal.

Bitcoin market cap is meaningless."
"Dude do yourself a favor, build a proper diversified investment portfolio. Your hodl should never cause you to panic. You need to separate your long term belief in it from the price action which is basically Wall Street's plaything right now. Never seeing 3k again is perhaps more likely than not but far from off the table. 

Even if it continues to rise, upside potential decreases with every run, meaning where some early adopters may have easily 100x their position, buying today we'd be very lucky to 10x. So hodling today is more risk, less reward. There will most likely never be more bitcoin-made millionaires than there are now. Just something to consider."

Lol you took that question pretty hard. As you can see by their reply they are in a similar boat just like you.
We're a lot more stable now, tyvm. I'm just not willing to throw hundreds into a newer market. We make more than enough to live comfortably, and if we decide to throw in $50 here or there for whatever purpose, that's our decision and not yours. Maybe you shouldn't go sticking your nose in other people's business?
It's play money, essentially.
"Easiest way now is Blue Wallet app. They control the channel for you, so you can get on and off immediately! You can withdraw this tip right after you open the app.

It’s a good thing any purchase I’ve made in the time this has been going on are locked in and not going to loose value. If it makes that drop I’m secure on that front but man...I honestly have no idea what I’d do. I just...really don’t. You?

If you came from my time, you'd know 20k really is nothing. It's at 150 million $ in the 2050's where I'm from. Came back here to buy the last dip under 10k
Why thank you kindly!

The good old days, when you could still buy a whole bitcoin.
Me too dude, but it's working!
President Yang really cleared the way.  Sending BTC to the actual moon was such a baller move!
It's some free Bitcoin for you :) it's on the lightning network!
Upvoting to the moon!
As do I fellow bit coner!!!
Now get on the LN with us bro :)
!lntip 100
Yes
yea, more than 3x from recent bottom is just terrible /s
Probably sells when this sub thinks it's going up and buys when it goes down
Many years from now when I tell stories of the wild days of bitcoin, this will be one of them.
Isn't this pretty much the logic behind Bitcoin valuation?
"I enjoy chaos,
Also of this has a measurable effect that would be interesting"
*inserts mojo jojo and devil meme*
hope to see it more higher and never goes down. (Disclaimer: This is for all the hodlers only)
I think this worked.
worked.
😂HODL BOIS FEW YEARS FROM NOW ITLL BE WIFE changing Fuck yeah
You got me paperboi
Cool! I have 10 BTC
Looks like it worked!

Wait....this....this might be working!

It's a dollar and 11 cents away from 10K right now. If only Bitcoin hadn't bought that coffee.
Saw this on my Google News... This post is soon gonna be upvoted by _everybody_...
Best!
this is about as good a Bitcoin strategy as any.
Rip Tesla man!
Are you getting in on Bitcoin?
It looks like Don Hertzfeldt's style.
Don't tell me what to do
Could be wrong but it seems to me your asking for karma
"/r/misleadingthumbnails

looks like a dude with two belly buttons sticking his dick in a box of McDonald's french fries"
Is it just me or does it look like it's going backwards sometimes? Like I see the cart going downwards....
What’s the easiest way to buy now?

I  remember when this sub was about mining. Veteran assholes would tell everyone new that it's not worth it to start mining since 2014.
Im gonna turn my phone upside down haha!
Well it kinda did jump back up a little bit.
Doing my part SIR!!!!!!!!!!!
Remember when btc was supposed to be a currency instead of an investment? This community is while bitcoin will fail in the long run.
Gone up $400. Good enough for me.
"Step 1: turn your phone upside down. 

Step 2: buckle up and prepare for rock bottom. 

Step 3: cry with ice cream."
Guys, I’ve been watching it flucuate between 12K and just under 10K. It’s a marginal increase/decrease in the grand sceme of things. If I see a hike of over or under 5K that’s when I get concerned. I logged in this morning and saw it was below 10K and had a mini panick attack as I have a lot inveseted in this crypto. It wasn’t even 3 hours later that I was seeing it back at a stable 10K +/- hundreds USD. Once I see it going below 9k I may start to become concerned. As of right now it just seems like standard market flucuation. Correct me if I’m wrong here but I’m just not seeing why everyone is having a fit over what looks like _standard_ market flucuation. Also, please enlighten me if this is the most aassinine take on what’s happening regarding the recent trends in BTC movement.
I checked the price before i even read the post title
[deleted]
I can't believe this worked
too real

This is aw3some lol
It doesn't work with a title like that.

Isn't BTC 10k atm?
Stonks
God knows I want this to crash again biggest regret of my life is not buying the coin when it was 3500$ I had the money but was talked out of it pfff wish I could sue those who made me doubt.
Who else checked their Coinbase/RH just seeing the gif??

"#ALMOST GOT ME

Weird mine is going down
Little do they know this post will actually increase the price.
Stop! If the bot see this they will make the price drop!
Still true if you bought at 6k
Holy fuck... over 15 k upvotes or am I dreaming
You don't go that fast uphill lmao
It is going down or up?
Man these Australian memes are great.
Aaaaand dipped

I thought the coin is being attacked by lasers lol...
I've seen this animation style before... who is it by?
jokes on you i can flip my phone upside down
I like to imagine that there's a bot that uses computer vision to scan this subreddit for rollercoaster gifs and trades on that information.
"ITS ABOVE 9K!!!

WHEEEEEE"
Why not take it to the next level and arrange a mass buy and hodl at the same exact time let’s become our own whale even just the news of such an event would cause a rise (buy the news )maybe it’s time to take charge as a bitcoin community instead of guessing it alone
It's working!
It worked
"I am very picky with posts I give Gold/Silver too. This one got fucking both LMAO!!!!

Best laugh/meme I have ever seen this is so good., can't believe your post moved the market."
Post every day...
In a shocking twist, the meme actually reversed the downtrend and now we are headed back to moon city
If you stare long enough it starts going backwards
My coworker and I were just talking about getting a Bitcoin gif/meme to the front page to inflate the price earlier today. I know you're not him though, cause he's got that gold.
Turn your phone upside down for an accurate depiction of the price

You bought very high then.
Don't cry, just hodl. It will get to 100k by December 2022 or I will eat a handful of rocks and live stream it.

No, trying to figure that out now.
Plot twist: the gif is upside dowm
If I know anything about economics this is exactly the type of sentiment that will get the price to jump back up.
Keep pushing
Dummy.
 But, isn’t he going down backwards?
Well that worked.
Somehow this worked...
It went up its working
Bitcoin goes up everytime this shows up.
Alright I see we are pumping bitcoin now...
If you look at this you can make it go backwards like he's falling towards the ground
Here /u/gifreversingbot, fixed it for you!
So you want to make us all poor. Thanks bitcoin babies.
Don't look now but it is shooting back up in after hours trading
I held my phone upside down... It makes sense now
