Don't tell me what to do
Btc is making me chronically dizzy hah -- worth it though
Are you getting in on Bitcoin?
You are solely responsible for this price hike. Pat yourself on the back OP. Thank you!
Could be wrong but it seems to me your asking for karma
this is about as good a Bitcoin strategy as any.
👀
Turn your phone upside down for an accurate depiction of the price
he looks like hes falling in reverse
Rip Tesla man!

I  remember when this sub was about mining. Veteran assholes would tell everyone new that it's not worth it to start mining since 2014.
What’s the easiest way to buy now?

Is it just me or does it look like it's going backwards sometimes? Like I see the cart going downwards....
So you want to make us all poor. Thanks bitcoin babies.
Here /u/gifreversingbot, fixed it for you!
If you look at this you can make it go backwards like he's falling towards the ground
Lol
"It never fails!

All I have to do is initiate a transfer to my crypto exchange and the price jumps up again.

Buy the dips they said.... It will average out they said....."
Now do this with Litecoin
This is going to fool every robinhood investor to buy buy buy.
Fooled me

 But, isn’t he going down backwards?
Don't look now but it is shooting back up in after hours trading
Keep pushing
Dummy.
Plot twist: the gif is upside dowm
No, trying to figure that out now.
That’s my life your messing with, man!
The points and lines that show the wind, is in fact a Morse code
Fuckin LOL
Rotate 180 degrees and you'll have a more accurate gif
It better not go up. I want decent GPU prices.
If I know anything about economics this is exactly the type of sentiment that will get the price to jump back up.

I've seen this animation style before... who is it by?
I like to imagine that there's a bot that uses computer vision to scan this subreddit for rollercoaster gifs and trades on that information.
"#ALMOST GOT ME

except, I had like... read the title too..."
My coworker and I were just talking about getting a Bitcoin gif/meme to the front page to inflate the price earlier today. I know you're not him though, cause he's got that gold.
Weird mine is going down
If you stare long enough it starts going backwards
In a shocking twist, the meme actually reversed the downtrend and now we are headed back to moon city
Post every day...
"I am very picky with posts I give Gold/Silver too. This one got fucking both LMAO!!!!

Best laugh/meme I have ever seen this is so good., can't believe your post moved the market."
It worked
It's working!
Why not take it to the next level and arrange a mass buy and hodl at the same exact time let’s become our own whale even just the news of such an event would cause a rise (buy the news )maybe it’s time to take charge as a bitcoin community instead of guessing it alone
"ITS ABOVE 9K!!!

WHEEEEEE"
Isn't BTC 10k atm?
Stonks
God knows I want this to crash again biggest regret of my life is not buying the coin when it was 3500$ I had the money but was talked out of it pfff wish I could sue those who made me doubt.
Who else checked their Coinbase/RH just seeing the gif??
jokes on you i can flip my phone upside down

Wait....this....this might be working!
God damn it. I’m so confused right now.
it worked
TiL bitcoin is still a thing. Hows it coming?
I can't believe this worked
[deleted]
I checked the price before i even read the post title
Guys, I’ve been watching it flucuate between 12K and just under 10K. It’s a marginal increase/decrease in the grand sceme of things. If I see a hike of over or under 5K that’s when I get concerned. I logged in this morning and saw it was below 10K and had a mini panick attack as I have a lot inveseted in this crypto. It wasn’t even 3 hours later that I was seeing it back at a stable 10K +/- hundreds USD. Once I see it going below 9k I may start to become concerned. As of right now it just seems like standard market flucuation. Correct me if I’m wrong here but I’m just not seeing why everyone is having a fit over what looks like _standard_ market flucuation. Also, please enlighten me if this is the most aassinine take on what’s happening regarding the recent trends in BTC movement.
Best!
"Step 1: turn your phone upside down.

Step 3: cry with ice cream."
Remember when btc was supposed to be a currency instead of an investment? This community is while bitcoin will fail in the long run.

Many years from now when I tell stories of the wild days of bitcoin, this will be one of them.
Isn't this pretty much the logic behind Bitcoin valuation?
"I enjoy chaos,
Also of this has a measurable effect that would be interesting"
