Because the people who do know are getting the fuck out
"It will hurt and has.

It could actually have a chance to kill this particular coin in its infancy. The mantle turned over to an technically broken bandaid."
Honestly surprised that it got any upvotes here at all.
"Shhh

The first rules of bitcoin is we do not talk about unconfirms"
"Crypto and bitcoin are still amazing tech.

It is running headlong into a basic scaling problem with this surge in adoption (which is still tiny).

Bitcoin because it was so massive got to run into this wall first (yeah us). The other coins will run into it too or will sacrifice so much as to make themselves unsafe and pointless."
Transactions from wallet to wallet need to be confirmed much like how a bank tracks transactions on their servers to prevent false transactions from taking place. The fact that I only just learned about these unconfirmed transactions is scary.
"A transaction is generally the movement of a coin or fraction of a coin from one location to another.

This movement is recorded on the chain in blocks of 1MB in total size.

Roughly every 10 minutes a block is added to the chain with those transactions in it.

3500ish per 10 mins.

The TX (transactions) have fees (small portions) attached and the miners choose which TXs get into the next block. They choose the ones with higher fees.

Right now if no one makes a new TX for the next 4 days then all the TXs will be completed.

It used to take under an hour then a few hours became the norm then 1/2 a day. Now fees keep rising to be able to have a decent chance to get a fast TX and the waits go up and up and up.

If you have $30 in bitcoin, you may never be able to move it due to the fees. If the fees become closer to $100 then you won't be able to spend or move that either.

"
">Being in bitcoin for a while if it goes down that fast, it will probably go up just as fast.

lol. its the other way around pal. it went up too fast and the market corrects. it oscillates. always. anyone who rode it up to 20k and didn't think it was going to drop almost as quickly would be an idiot."

Its my opinion that its better that whales sell now and live their 1% lives, than in the future. When they sell, more people own BTC and it gets less concentrated. 
Good, the more those 1000 people sell the more distributed it can become if lots of new people buy in. 
"according to [this](https://howmuch.net/articles/bitcoin-wealth-distribution) 4% of wallets own 96+% of bitcoin. Dunno how reliable those numbers are though.

edit: apologies for linking medium, but [this has a slightly more detailed look at wealth concentration](https://medium.com/@BambouClub/are-you-in-the-bitcoin-1-a-new-model-of-the-distribution-of-bitcoin-wealth-6adb0d4a6a95)"
i thought it was too expensive at 1k then at 3k i thought it couldn't go any higher
But it got fucked pretty quick, I believe...down almost 50%, or was this just FUD? I can believe it though...
What have you done...
Applied for a bitstamp account to buy ripple a week ago. Still haven't gotten authenticated.

"What do you use Quadriga or.. Kraken?

We've got over a week until the next market correction. A week of people hyper-promoting BCH and at least a few news stories who will cast this as Bitcoin's demise. The price is going to go lower. Fingers crossed for 9k or even 5k before the next difficulty adjustment. If they wait until true bottom, they'll even out the spread even more.

It’s actually well accepted logic. You haven’t lost or gained anything until you realize the losses and gains. You still own the same assets. 
He can't sell anyways if he's trying to hide it from his wife...
Wish I sold a few days ago. I’d buy now and be perfectly happy 
Well done! I think the right time might have been right when you posted this comment. 
I was active from 2013 to 2015 mainly mining LTC & buying up BTC on major dips. Never sold any BTC or LTC & haven’t bought any either since 2015, which maybe I should’ve but it’s all good. 
Even just sell one and have a small (liquid) emergency fund, in case anything happens in your life!

Yes. 
That's because transactions are taking two days to go through. Nobody knows the toll yet.
You're really, really dumb if you think this is the storm. This is the pre crash volatility. You could just be being deceptive 
"The dip isn't the problem. The problem is that at the current price and adoption rates, bitcoin is one of the worst currency systems I have heard of in my life.  
  
Bitcoin's value stems entirely from its usefulness as a currency. How useful is a currency that is hard limited to 3 transactions a second, costs +$20 a transaction, and has wait times of nearly a day? 
  
And the more people that adopt bitcoin, the higher the price gets, the worse these problems get. Bitcoin is a failure of a currency at the scale it's currently at and there's no way to fix it. "

This is garbage logic. Market value decrease of an asset you own is a loss.
But he's lost the option of selling without taking a loss.
What if it dies die though. Wallstreet doesn't want it to win. They want to proclaim it dead and name some other coin king that will give them more upside. I don't like bcash or Roger Ver but he has more strategic pieces then BTC. And all the talk of it being centralized doesn't amount to S+hit because that's what the masses are use to and comfortable with. B2x coming out on the 28th. 6 other forks happening this month alone. All the pieces corporate need to flat line BTC. Talk of dilution, talk or extremely high fees, slow transition times, u able to get out in a timely manner and losing big profits if you keep your coins on a hard wear wallet. What the community of Crytpo fails to realize is everything gets ruined by mainstream. Think with brain and not heart. 
There is also no shame in exiting a losing position
Yeah Confido bag holders haven't lost any money if they haven't sold yet. Tell those Confido investors that lost their life savings they're in luck if they still have their Confido coins!

Yeah, they are going to go through every penny in any account you have that she knows of.  I think I could have had an extra bank account and nobody would have know. 
how come we never see the other side of the story?
Thanks I am not planning on daytrading just thinking about a reasonable entry point given how clearly late I am. I also am trying to use volatility in my favor because when something trades 20k and 13k in one week it inherently means chasing is stupid and the return profile of a 13k buy over a 20k buy is over 50% higher on a lifetime investment. As far as the 50% stoploss I am investing an amount id consider for speculation as I would any big stock position so meaningful enough if it pops off. That degree of loss is me saying let me really be wrong and not care if i eat it on a generational trade. I see options returns and losses that would equate to a 5x move in bitcoin (going to 100k) from here everyday so I am more or less desensitized to the percentage swings just want a set it and forget it price.
Your perspective of the world is much scarier than mine. Good luck. 
Well, damn!!!  Thanks for the summary, you filled in some gaps for me
Wait for the market to clear first, when transactions don't have a wait time of a year (I may be exaggerating a bit here) you will know the market has settled down.
Thats what everybody has been saying ever since btc hit 100usd. Also there are plenty of other cryptocurrencies who have a higher chance of doing a 1000% gain from here other than bitcoin. Dont focus too much on the one thats getting the most hype.
dude, i don't even know what that word means.
"It has no value as currency, it has no value as value holder.

"The guy that owns the business I work for asked me about bitcoins this last week. My co-boss I guess.

My guy made money off BreEx (as did many) even though it was silly. Bitcoin? From what I am hearing, going to go up and cRAZY so.

Geographical diversity ..."
Seriously, so it’s not a currency, it’s...who the hell knows what it is. From what I’m gathering anything less than $100 worth of BTC is worthless? 
Exchanges don't use the bitcoin network they have their own centralised ledger. The btc network is only used transferring btc to or from the exchange. 
"> Is there a way to tell if those 284k TX were people trading the currency on an exchange? 

(Edit:) Most exchanges are centralized, i.e. trades happen off the blockchain. So actual trades don't account for those transactions.

However, a lot of the transactions are likely to be people depositing and withdrawing money from exchanges because of the boom in trading activity. There's no evidence of Bitcoin adoption as a currency increasing dramatically recently - if anything, it's been falling off due to some of the problems.

> If/when these TX go through, would they have any effect on the current price on exchanges if so? 

Because most exchange trades happen off the blockchain, the only effect that Bitcoin transaction speed has on the BTC price is indirect.

If people are having trouble getting their money on and off exchanges, that's going to have an effect on prices. Interestingly, when the Bitfinex exchange recently was having trouble with deposits and withdrawals, its Bitcoin price ended up getting over $1000 higher than some other exchanges, but came back down again once the problems were (somewhat) mitigated.

> Are these funds locked up until the transactions go through? 

In theory, it's possible to ""cancel"" unconfirmed transactions, by reissuing the transaction with a higher fee (to make it more likely to be picked up by miners) and sending the money back to yourself. In practice, there can be challenges with this. Wallet software often doesn't support it, you may not control the transaction (if your money is on an exchange), etc.

> Could someone have bought BTC at a lower price, but due to a delayed TX it goes through at the higher price?

(Edit:) The trade itself is unaffected because (most) exchanges are centralized and not on the blockchain. There's no notion of ""price"" on the blockchain - 1 BTC is always worth 1 BTC.

That sounds like a terrible plan
"He's probably full of wisdom like: ""Only buy before it's about to go up in price"""
I'm glad I'm out of it now but I hit a rough patch for a while after a relationship and would internally groan anytime someone offered financial advice.

"honestly what I find just absolutely astounding, statistically speaking of course, is how many people seem to make exactly as much money as they need and live paycheck to paycheck. 

isn't that odd? you'd think either people would not have enough or be saving something. but somehow people sort of seem to manage to get by for the most part on exactly what they make. 

but they don't do it on purpose of course... its just a huge coincidence. 


funny thing though, if you give them a raise they don't seem to put any money away. they just start spending that whole paycheck instead.

This is why other cryptos are going up in price/use. Bitcoin can't even opperate as it was originally intended, so people have to resort to the lower volume/more effective cryptos.

"Background is in accounting and I understand BTC fairly well. Assuming he does some very illegal things, they can't prove shit honestly EDIT: If he is meticulous and flawless. The burden of proof is on them to prove he has it/had it during the divorce. **DO NOT DO ANYTHING I LISTED HERE AS IT'S VERY VERY ILLEGAL AND COULD RESULT IN TIME IN JAIL** . But in theory here's how people could launder money via BTC (and why the government really sees BTC as a threat in money launders/drug trade). Also, future money laundering techniques will make future Breaking Bad a very very boring show, because there is no need for a carwash or chicken. 


1. Buy some pumped/overvalued altcoin on an exchange tied to your actual personal information.

2. Scrub the alt coin (basically makes it untraceable)

3. Move the scrubbed altcoin to another exchange with fake personal info. Sell the altcoin at a similar BTC cost. Rebuy a more valuable coin (like BTC/ETH/LTC/Monero) with the now untraceable fund and put it in a wallet (meaning, you're out very little - albeit susceptible to a huge crash when you're between cryptos).  We'll call this ""hidden BTC"". 

4. Wait for alt-coin to crash

5. Buy a shitload of crashed altcoin post-crash.

6. Move the same number of the altcoin back to exchange with your personal info.

7. Sell alt-coin at a huge loss and put the low proceeds back into bank. You now have your ""loss"" and your ""hidden BTC"". Tell wife you lost a shitload of money on crypto to ensure she files for divorce. 

8. If asked about it by lawyer, say you were investing in crypto and due to the divorce you divested as you'd be incurring more expenses with a single income. 

On the books, it looks like you bought an altcoin on an exchange, moved it out of your wallet, moved the same number of alt coins back to your wallet, and divested at a huge capital loss. In actuality, you only held the altcoin for a brief period of time and sold it right after. 

The next problem is that you now have a bunch of BTC you need to legitimize.

1. Post-divorce, buy a few mining rigs and set up an LLC. 

2. Use said mining rigs to mine whatever the fuck ICOs you want.

3. Wait until a coin that originated AFTER the divorce moons. It might not be the coin you mined, but that doesn't matter.

4. Calculate a reasonable number of coins you COULD have mined with the mining power you had. 

5. Use your ""hidden BTC"" to buy some alt coins and put it into a wallet. Scrub and transfer to another wallet. Ideally, do it in multiple transactions so you aren't as susceptible to a flash crash. 

6. Deposit alt coin onto an exchange and sell (an exchange outside of the US' jurisdiction would make it a shitload easier). Claim this as LLC profit from your 100% legit mining operation. Pay your fucking taxes. Make sure there's no way to prove you mined XYZ coin instead of PROFIT coin. 


7. Don't be stupid. Live to your prior living standards for years after. If you must flaunt your wealth, wait until you have a justification to do-so (ie a job promotion). Tell all your workers about your LLC. Establish a history before you suddenly become rich.

8. Don't mention what you did to a single fucking soul. Whether it be your drinking buddies, family, or reddit. Everyone has a price. Someone could tip off the wife for a small percentage of her legal ruling. Not only would you risk losing the money, but now you also committed felonious money laundering. 

EDIT: Thought I'd add, I've never tried doing this before because I'm not involved in criminal activity (else I wouldn't have posted on my main account or even on an alt account). If someone has further insight as to why this wouldn't work, feel free to chime in. I'm basing my information solely on my experience with the crypto market + my knowledge of how US money laundering cases. I'm moreso sharing this theory to educate people on the very real reason governments/banks fear crypto. 

EDIT2: Also thought I'd do this for fun

LIST OF CRIMINAL YOU PROBABLY WOULD COMMIT in addition to more: Tax evasion **multiple times**, even if you do pay taxes on the final product (because you didn't claim gains/losses on the exchange of alt-coins). Failure to disclose assets (to both the IRS and to the courts during the divorce). Perjury (at minimum, to the divorce lawyer). Conspiracy. And of course, money laundering. Potential identity theft laws in the foreign country which you use the exchange. Not to mention, the not criminal civil laws.

"> according to this 4% of wallets own 96+% of bitcoin. 

That really tells you nothing about the distribution of bitcoin among *people*.

You can easily have hundreds of addresses that you used a single time and that are empty now, while all of your remaining Bitcoin are at one single address. "
"This doesn't really tell us anything. Number of addresses doesn't mean number of wallets. A wallet that an individual has, can have thousands of addresses. And an individual can have thousands of wallets. 

Besides... We don't know how many of those top 100 addresses belong to businesses (mostly exchanges, but also vendors and service providers who take and provide BTC as a payment solution). Would you be upset if you found out that 90% of the World's money is in posession (which doesn't neccessarily mean they own it) of banks?

No, you're right. It's versatile. It can go up, it can go down, it can split itself like some sort of mitosis shit over and over again ad infinitum. Versatile.
Versatile means you can use it in a lot of ways.  Volatile means it's unpredictable and prone to large changes in value.

"Very true, I cashed out most of my BTC earlier and could've made more money cashing it out last week. Or I could've held it til today and cried. Or maybe tomorrow it's back up.

"See the people who talk about it just being a bubble don't understand this.  Bitcoin is backed by the drug trade, it's like the petro-dollar but with drugs instead. 

While these online drug markets exist bitcoin will always have value."
"Hah! Same here! ...Except I only got into it two months ago.

If only I had been curious about illegally buying LSD half a decade earlier!"
I invested bitcoins to over throw democratically elected governments in subsaharan africa and now I do not even have enough money to over throw the queen of england
I'm never not following drug or porn trends again tbh
Could you explain your reasoning? I dont have any BTC, im just curious
Crypto is amazing tech. The way that handheld gaming is amazing tech but why would i be playing monochrome gameboy when I can emulate n64 games in a smartphone?
So does Roger Ver has a point? Bitcoin Cash is the way to go?
"So for those playing at home, using bitcoin requires paying a $20+ fee and waiting half a day. It's hard limited to 3 transactions a second and there is no way to upgrade the source code whatsoever. 
   
The more people that use it, the worse it will get. So, yeah. I have no idea why people got it into their heads that bitcoin was worth more than Tesla.   "
"Thank you. This also answers my question of ""what will happen if all miners stopped mining""."
That sounds worthless. 
"> you may never be able to move it due to the fees.

This is assuming the situation doesn't change, which it 100% will change.  Hopefully newer addons to bitcoin will ease the burden.  However, even if the worst case scenario happens and bitcoin drops dramatically, that means that fewer people will be using it and the fees will go down, allowing you to move your (now worth less than before) coins.

People don't realize they are buying in to the beta version of a technology, it says so [right on the bitcoin.org website.](https://bitcoin.org/en/faq#what-are-the-disadvantages-of-bitcoin)  Need to give it time to flesh out all the features first.  Nobody was expecting it to blow up this fast.

I'm not saying people shouldn't buy bitcoin, you absolutely should **if you believe it has a future**, but don't expect to move it around all willy-nilly right now.  And don't put in [more than you are willing to lose!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7gi55s/dont_invest_recklessly/)"
This is why bitcoin is a joke.

Wow thanks never considered that lmao
You say that like people do it on purpose.. 
"Of course, even if it goes to $100 I'll keep them. 
I'm not an expert (I bought $50 in 2016 and $1k a few days ago) I think that the idea/technology is great, even if there are some struggles now (fees, time of processing a transaction, etc.) And has a good potential value, will see if it will recover some day."

I rememeber when everyone and their mom was stoked about the Facebook IPO and everyone thought they were ahead of the curve by jumping into it. Price crashed and everyone bailed really early on. But if you look where its at today after the masses blew their load, it would have still be a pretty decent investment. Also, idk what im talking about.
You got the wrong alts my friend. Mine are way up
i belive it will go up again like it always did.

He just needs to hodl on tight now
unless you own bitcoin
I lost 80% of my investment when I accidentally sent coin to a bitcoin cash wallet from bitcoin core wallet. (Using bitcoin iOS client).  40$ worth. Of course there is no way to get it back because no one has a private key for that wallet unless someone lucky generated the exact same wallet.  It's these type of stuff that makes me think the system is still quite flaky, there isn't much safe guards.  
Not ripple. Not litecoin.
he sure got the balls to test his balls.
How does people manage to panic so easily... All the shit you see are from those buy high sell low cryptotards, man up and buy the fucking dip, thats how winning its done. HODL.

This is what a correction feels like. We had a rally, now the bears are in. Even it loses 50% it's only pushed back to last month's price.
Anyone who has watched bitcoin for more than the 3 months it's been on cnn knew this was coming. 
"So, I am a swing trader with a few years of experience under my belt. I by no means do it as a fulltime job, and I by no means like crypto, but should you have any holdings in cryptocurrencies, the following information is extremely important.

The past few weeks showed the setup of a possible head and shoulders pattern. It seems crypto is in the right trough. What happens next really depends on how it behaves over the next couple days.

An educated guess is its running through a head and shoulders pattern since we already have established the following set points.

- left shoulder around December 7th 16,500 realm

- left dip, 13500 realm around December 10th

- head, 19500 realm around December 17th.

And it looks like we are establishing a neckline at around 12,000 right now. Which suggests a falling neckline. This is Bad. If you say this is good you are an idiot. If it is a head and shoulders pattern this is in, it will rebound to the 16000 realm to complete the right shoulder before it falls off a cliff to god knows where.

This bubble looks all set to pop, possibly in the next week or so. If I had any holdings, I would be watching the price very closely for signs that confirm this pattern.

Recommended course of action if you hold crypto for some stupidly retarded reason: watch it over the next day or so, see if it sinks past 12000. If it does, *sell immediately to protect capital*. If it starts to rebound, target your sell point at around 15,000 to 16,000 as that should be where the right shoulder will peak. If you miss that you are fucked because bitcoin will fall off a cliff and the entire crypto market will crash. Optimistic guess that lower bounds of crash would be to low thousands high hundreds, since wall street is starting to poke around with it. But it could crash to 0 and die in a fire.

So, all of that is Assuming of course you could pull you money out quick enough, like any other security that exists ever. But crypto, being a retarded combination of volatile and not very liquid at all, probably won't let you get out with any sense of urgency, which could mean you miss the boat and lose biggly. So, with that fundamental taken into account.

 **Sell, sell it all and run for your life. Don't look back, leave. Get the fuck out. She's going down captain! You will not go to space today.**
-

Hopefully that's memey enough for the densest of crypto heads to understand. 

If your lucky enough to pull out in time, and still wish to invest, I encourage you to look into investing into green industries, robotics, and municipal bonds. The skills you all are learning still translate to other securities, and you stand to make money, as long as you don't make the same mistake of getting cocky and putting all of your eggs into a rocket powered basket without thinking about buying a parachute. And last bits of parting advice: when trading, the worst thing you can think is that 'this time its different' it never is. Don't let emotion make the decisions for you, base your decisions on the fundamentals and the technicals and not *hype trains*

Good luck, and I hope you get out in time.

Edit: sauce I am using is charts.bitcoin.com for clarity"

Bought 2k at 16,200 im scared to drop another 2k at the current price. 
[deleted]
I sold all as soon as it was mentioned on SNL. That was the end.
Still, if you had told me a month ago that $12k was a low, I would’ve called you crazy. 
new poster...I have been following this BTC run from the sidelines...I have been a hedge fund analyst trading stocks and options (more volatile than the craziest day in bitcoin) for 9 years (started in Jan 08 before the crash) so only thinking about it from that framework..I am curious why folks do not talk about bitcoin in terms of market cap. I am also curious how many folks have participated in parabolic trades. It seems pretty obvious to me that a 14k move that has trumped years of marketcap growth in less than 2 mos needs to be consolidated. I would think 8K seems like a screaming buy but also totally reasonable expectation over the next few months but plan to leg in at hopefully 13k and more heavily at 11k but the goal would be to load up at 8k. Almost all stock breakouts occur after periods of sustained consolidation so 20k 17k 14k and the daily freakouts all feels like noise until you go through this consolidation phase and you do not see sustained rallies during periods of high volatility so that also needs to dissipate which takes time. The flip side is i saw parabolic charts that look exactly like this in crude/agriculture in 08, DDD (3d printing company in 2012), GPRO 90 dollar stock went parabolic now trades at 9...my point is my strategy is to try and average cost around 10k put my stop at 5k eat a 50% loss if wrong and if it breaks below that know that its a bubble and the retail buyer we all need to get to 50k 100k will be burned and never coming back. Seems like not a lot of financial perspective being applied on this thread so curious if I am just not thinking about this the right way with this buyer base. I respect the HODL philosophy but i am not sure how many people are understanding the overall market cap dollar gains that have occured over the % moves. 
Is that Roger Ver? Riding Bcash into the ground?
"I read a couple of those technical analysis of bitcoin blogs where they say ""look at this chart! As you can see from some lines I am drawing here connecting pieces of it, that the trendline is perpendicular to the failing resistance of the square root of your mom so my recommendation is to do a thing and then eat a donut""

But I actually do take some comfort in the idea that price was increasing along a certain parabola all year, and then in December it spiked ""hypodermically"" above that parabola, and so people have not wanted to buy as normal because they figure, well, the price is probably going to come back down. And that the drop back down to the former parabola will be painful but then after that we'll get another 10x or more increase over the course of 2018. 

But whatever! Spaghetti!"
My buddy invested a months salary into ripple when it was at 15 cents, he’s just enjoying the ride.

The real question is why only now.. if you think this is bad, just wait a couple months. 
"It's almost like pumping prices far above the most optimistic intrinsic value analysis created a bubble, and y'all are now entering the pre-crash volatility stage.

Shoulda asked your parents about the housing market crash that happened back when you were in middle school. Would've been a far less harsh lesson than losing your shit now."
"I agree, I don't see blockchain going anywhere.  I'm just so sick of pumpers on my Facebook feed. I feel like up until recently it has grown organically, now it's the next big thing and getting pumped to the moon. it'll go back up, but I could just as easily see it hitting 5K before it hits 40K. And when Moms and Pops, that just heard about it on CNBC, see a chunk of their retirement go from $200,000 to $80,000 in two months, they'll pull the plug to stop the bleeding, which will cause more sell off. Don't 1000 people own 40% of Bitcoin? A few people decide they want to live out they're lives as multi billionaires and sell all; it'll be pandemonium. Long story longer, if it hits 7K again I'll buy in.  But what do I know, I went to public school, and I thought it was too expensive at $3300. "
"Here i am ;-),  if you invest in ripple you can just as well give your money to the establishment. Ripple is siffoning off 1 billion ripple worth out of the ecosystem. The higher the rate the more they make. "
Not Litecoin? What charts are you watching? 
Yes Litecoin.
Monero had a good day too. Had an all time high I believe.

"Being early is overrated. The right time to buy is when it starts going back up again. You just have to hope it doesn't go up too fast.

Always assume that the trend is going to continue in that direction until you see otherwise. THEN go for it.

People always want to be that one guy who went all in on a $0.04 stock and made billions. The problem is most $0.04 stocks become $0.00 stocks.

This could very well be the end for Bitcoin. Instead of a bubble burst it might be a slow bubble deflate. You can gamble on that if you want to but I don't want any part of it."

Being in bitcoin for a while if it goes down that fast, it will probably go up just as fast. I can see it hit nearly 20k this time by NYE's, too many newbies and weak hands are getting shaken off by whales. And it's the perfect time to shake off the weak hands with all the FUD between bitcoin and bitcoincash.
Fully deserved, hopefully this lesson doesn't cost you your apartment but how fucking dumb can you be to gamble away the rent
"> January rent is going to be tough...

I hope that's a joke.  If not, I would suggest you pull out of bitcoin and focus on stabilizing rather than fantasizing about how you can double down on your money.  That's the same mentality people have when they are behind on a payment and go to the casino to make up for it.

Investing in something this volatile is fun if you have extra cash to burn or simply as a more interesting way of gambling, but if you are going to struggle financially if this doesn't work out, I would personally get out of it now, even if that means getting out at a loss.

If at some point you stabilize to the point where you're not worried about rent, I would still suggest you save some money up as an emergency fund.  And if you want to keep investing at that point, buying safe stocks is a much better bet.

Missing out on an opportunity to get much more out of your money sucks, but struggling to make it from pay check to pay check fucks up your life.

Anyway, I'm not trying to lecture you.  I'm just saying my point of view and what I would do so you can at least think it through from another perspective.  I hope things work out for you."

Real pros who hide money do it by hiding **income**, meaning new money that comes in is shunted to hidden accounts that are completely separate from your existing accounts, because they're in a foreign country, or in the name of a LLC that can't easily be traced to you, and so on. 

You can't do this with investment income, though, because they'll just get your broker account records easily. "
Well, I am down a few mil USD. But then again my total investment back in the day was less than the price of 1BTC now. I’ve been HODLING for years. War of nerves. 
If the courts find this out you could be in serious trouble. It's also really easy to see when you enter and exit bitcoin through exchanges. 
Delete this post, you retard.  You don't want to your soon-to-be ex-wife finding this out do you?  Seriously, the first step to hiding money is to not post about it online.  Don't write anything online that you wouldn't want her lawyer bringing up in court.

"> I lost ~20,000 CND today.

This seems like the kind of thing you wouldn’t want to admit in public on the internet. 
"What if one of the upcoming forks overtakes BTC? BTC is *useless* now. It has proven it is, and it isn't willing to change. It takes too long to transfer, it is useless for small amounts now, and the fees (which was the whole drawing point of BTC) are hurting it. It has never been anonymous.

Now we have some forks that are (or will be) competing on these areas. Once the masses start using them, BTC loses its value. Could be the most spectacular crash in modern history.

The Day Of Blood
" It's a result of a an organized attack by bitcoin cash cartel. 
 
 2 days ago one  breakaway ex Bitcoin.com Dev ,that is heavily invested in Bitcoin Cash, announced that he sold all his Bitcoins and Bought Bitcoin cash instead - a lot of mainstream media reported that announcement - yet many of those media outlets completely miss reported the news, omitting the details and shortened it to something that sounds like ""Bitcoin creator sells all his Bitcoins, says Bitcoin is doomed"".
 
 Simultaneously Reddit Crypto boards got flooded by BCH shills bashing BTC and worshiping BCH. And the following day, in a suspiciously convenient time for all the shills Coinbase adds BCH, causing BTC to rapidly plummet and BCH to rapidly rise in a short period of time.
 The cartel probably intended to pump BCH at the expense of BTC, and it worked for them in the short term, but the side effect is that it caused a lot of people to pull out of crypto completely, causing damage to all the Cryptos.
 
That's my impression at least. People seriously need to stop messing around with BTC and understand that if Bitcoin goes down, everything goes down. We need to work towards stability, not manipulate volatile markets for personal gains, but try to convince someone when there are millions at stake..."
Panicky newbies, high TX fees, long confirmation times, mountains of FUD, naturally correction to an altogether too quick rise. Probably a little bit of all of the above.
Put it in another crypto or keep it in your pocket. I wouldn't touch BTC with a 10ft pole rn.

Majority of my money is in ripple and that drop had me laughing. 
Hovering around 12k.
Bolded text made me lol
You could be like me and buy a bunch when it was $100, only to be an idiot and hold it all in an exchange that got hacked. 
"literally nobody knows why bitcoin increases in price other than more people buying into it. there's nothing concrete behind the technology that one can point to and be like, ""see this caused the increase"" like you can with companies or real currencies. "
It's truly shocking to me how many people are dumb enough to fall for this.
"Basically the Apple reselling market. 

"" Hey I'm selling my old barely working Macbook from 2009 for 600$""

"" Oh, wow. Its 20017 and 600$ is cheap for a Macbook from 2009. I will buy it and after 10 more years of use I can still fetch 400$ price when I sell it.""

"value just means it can be exchanged for something OF value

if someone is willing to give you food for it, then it has value. it's all a psychological concept

just because something is intangible doesn't mean it's not allowed to have value, people buy and sell digital things all the time now. like weapons and armor in games 

if you're asking ""why does it need to exist when we have other things that are a measure of value that do the job better?"" then that's a different answer. the answer to that is, bitcoin was designed to do be better than fiat at two things, being anonymous and being out of the control of a governing power. the third thing, being easy to exchange was on the list of things it should do well but has since fallen off due to unforseen design flaws

other cryptocurrencies built on the back of bitcoin's innovation handle transactions much better

TLDR - you want money that's better at being money? this is the road towards it. bitcoin is the journey not the destination"
It has no value. Pure speculation, like beanie babies, except worse.
Nope, literally zero intrinsic value. Completely relies on rampant speculation, irrational exuberance, and the greater fool theory. 
Yes. Yes you have. Plenty of us tried to warn you 
">10x or more increase
  
Because a currency that costs $20+ to use *per transaction* and has wait times of nearly a day is totally worth 10x more than it is now.  
  
Which, btw, would make the transaction costs $200 per transaction and god only knows what the wait times would be. Lol. "
At the start banks didn't do anything that people weren't already doing, they just did it on a larger scale. Borrowing, lending and transferring money. They solved real everyday issues that people were having, bitcoin: not so much.
