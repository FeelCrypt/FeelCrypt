Please line item the $100k expense of 'processing them in and out of jail'.  I find this stat difficult to trust.
"No, your reasoning doesn't work. It's like claiming that the existence of investments will never allow for anyone with stocks to buy anything. After all, why buy a new car when you could invest the money in the NASDAQ and buy two newer cars 7 years from now? People decide for themselves what level of money they're comfortable putting somewhere else. I'm not claiming you should always invest your money, I'm pointing out the stupidity of calling charity donations ""investments"" when actual investments could be ten times more advantageous."
"Eh, sorry for being a bit of a twat. Yes, the rates are progressive, so $10m in one year received as income pays nearly 37%, while $300k/year for 33.34 Years would pay closer to 28%. 

The parent could pay directly w/o a charity, as the IRS heavily scrutinized comp paid from charities to family members.

Or a parent can give $10m directly one time w/o gift tax.

All I’d say is for all the crap the US tax system receive, it’s actually pretty fair and reasonable. It’s simple to complain about it, but difficult to improve upon it (at least w/o causing more issues). "
It's just a risky investment and high risk high reward investments are always good investments as a small % of a diversified portfolio.
They do.  I don't.  And they pay a much smaller percentage in the united states.
"Don't forget to make your charities charter *""advocacy""* and then hire your brother in-laws PR firm to run all the *""advocacy""* marketing, which amounts to nothing but asking for more donations.

Keep it all in the family and never let a cent out."
Sorry, I should've said it's not a particularly *safe* investment. Which, in my mind, equals not good.
Invest 10% of your income into a TDA with  a 7% fixed yearly return. Thank me later.
"Having trouble finding that exact figure and can't recall where I first heard/saw it - maybe local radio - but it stuck.  The number isn't really that far fetched when you consider it includes the cost of police time, court time, ER visits, etc.   

Doing a quick search this morning there is more than ample evidence to show that it is cheaper to house them than ignore them.

Most articles I do find cite these two Rand studies: https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR1694.html and https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB10000.html

And I found this stating that its more like $40k so maybe I misremembered. http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/mar/12/shaun-donovan/hud-secretary-says-homeless-person-costs-taxpayers/

So, yeah, you're probably right - the $100k number is probably overstated.  However, the point remains valid - its cheaper to house them than leave them in their campsites.

Right now, if you follow the news, Orange County CA has recently forcibly emptied a large ""settlement"" and there is a lot of discussion about where to send them.  The judge making the calls seems determined to ""solve"" the homeless problem once and for all with an eye to becoming a model for the nation.

"Is that also why as soon as they can ""hire"" robots to stock shelves and answer customer questions and clean toilets, they will?

One day the greeter will be the *only* person left in the store."
Awareness is a good one too. Really? I’ve never heard of breast cancer before!
Try Carebit Masternode, huge ROI even though it's supposed to be a charity coin
"Just look up ""social investment"", it's sometimes more attractive than mainstream investment and you can get tax relief."
"How will this solve the homeless problem once and for all if it will also incentivize more people to become or remain homeless?

Also, what apartment complex owner / manager wants to house the homeless?  Have you ever spent time at a homeless shelter?  You'll walk away less sympathetic.  All of the volunteers donating their time, money, and resources and a majority of the homeless can't even pitch in on simple tasks.

If anyone here has ever visited the beautiful city of Austin, Texas... drive by the homeless shelter and look at all the vagrants sitting and lying around with tons of paper garbage littering their presence with empty trash cans steps away.  They lack basic initiative, pride, and grit.

If you're going to donate, do so for people who are appreciative."
they do
It's not particular good investment? lol tell that to anyone that invested in 2016, 15, 14, 13, 12...
or a few bad actors. Namely 2

"Except the logical conclusion is that it will ALWAYS be better to invest the money and donate it to charity later. In 18 years, when your original $100 is now $6400, it’s now a good idea to invest that $6400 for another 18 years to donate it later.

That reasoning doesn’t work."
Damn I feel old
Welcome to Crypto
"10% of everything which comes through the door.

You just gotta find a bunch of paedophile servicing orphanages in Cambodia to dump the other 90% on then you can go get more."
should ask when do i invest 10% of my saving to bitcoin.
Depends on how you define investing.
"I invest ~35k into charity a year. That's the proportion of my tax paid that the government specifically redistributes into welfare. 

It's bs.

  "
"Sorry, I didn't realize money received as a gift didn't effect the receiver's taxes.

Still, in the US, there are less taxes paid on $300,000 a year income over thirty-four-ish years than are paid on $10,000,000 in one year."
hahaha
Investing 10% each in both BTC and charity is a good idea. Returns will be pleasant.
"Here's a charity worth investing in. Returns of £899 if running your own masternode:)

I just understood from you how all that ^ works. Thanks for that.
"The people talking shit about bitcoin now are the ones who will FOMO in when it's 40k + (then bitch and complain when it retraces to 20k).
