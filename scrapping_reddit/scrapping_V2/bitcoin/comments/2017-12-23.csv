Yeah, because banks use PayPal for everything right? What a joke
With how lax the credit market is, if you're getting denied for a credit card application you probably don't *have* any money to be spending in the first place.
Like a debit card? Or a secured credit card? Or even a gift card? The application is for your ability to pay the loan, not for the card itself. You can drop that one feature without losing many of the benefits. 
"Mine is taking forever, abandoned the last one (which was taking over a day) and started a new transaction.

"That doesn't account for the part where a Bitcoin transaction costs 50+ USD right now.

It'll always be coupled to fiat in that way, and it makes Bitcoin useless for daily transacting."
Except that it’s terrible and a plague on the environment. Owning gold, selling gold costs nothing for me or the environment. Selling $40 in bitcoin will cost me $70 and use enough energy to power a Tesla 1,000 miles. BTC sucks. I’m glad it’s getting people into the market, I’m terrified that we’ll miss climate caps because 5 guys want to make a fee pool. The world will be better when BTC is gone and better DAG or PoS cryptos are the standard.
Except that gold can also be used to make spaceships and computers. What if someone made a cryptocurrency that also solved 3D protein structures instead of arbitrary crypto equations? Now that would make it more like an actual commodity/gold.

Any idea why Valve stopped accepting Bitcoin?
"Vendors and supplies must choose a common currency to transact in or else it is subject to exchange rate shenanigans. Currently exchange rate shenanigans of bitcoin are insane due to volatility and fees. I believe this problem is solvable with segwit implementation, lightning network and time. It will take time for bitcoin volatility to decrease because it needs to become widely distributed, and have a much higher market cap, like gold or the usd to achieve stability.

The fee problem Is the most important one to solve because evem with volatiloity a retailer would be willing to accept bitcoin and then they choose whether to save it or sell it to pay for their vendor. Ideally they wou la choose to save it."

If you believe in government protections than you have misunderstood the fundamentals of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is for people who have lost faith in the establishment after 2008 banking collapse and government bailouts.
As a store of value it’s not really finite though...it can be forked or cloned into alt coins that are functionally the same?
It's centralized from the perspective of payment processors. It's not centralized from the currency issuance perspective. Your money is also never outside of your control.
No its not. What does this mean for bitcoin as the price is so high. How will it actually be used.?

What makes BTC more valuable?

"
he was being sarcastic
Whoosh
It doesnt. You can't pay taxes with it (something nearly all other currencies have), so it's just about how much people agree it's worth.
"I would argue that the act of mining is what gives bitcoin any relation to the real world, in that it requires time and resources to mine so therefore those realities are reflected into the price. Outside of that, it's worthless, ficticious value.

That said, that price is way below what bitcoin is actually selling for because it's been driven up by a spectulative bubble as rich folks try to use it to hoard wealth and avoid capital controls until the market corrects that value and we see a bunch of people lose money because they didn't sell quick enough due to their hubris in thinking this would go on skyward forever.

That and the real value of bitcoin to banking is the blockchain technology which will be adopted by banks without the whole stupid ""coin"" shit."
"Literally nothing. Not kidding. Bitcoin sells because people think Bitcoin should sell. It's not backed by an economy, like actual currencies, and not backed by value in a commodity or company like... well, commodities and stocks. It's as if people decided ""Hey wrapping paper is really cool, I will buy this scrap for $20.000"" - only that you cannot even wrap anything with it."
"Nah. Gold has a utility value in eletronics, chemistry, and for making shiny stuff. 

Edit: Even the hyperinflated Reichsmark had a use as fuel and as a toy (I'm not kidding, children played with bundles of money). Or to write notes on. "
Not really. Gold is something you can keep for centuries and it will still be about as valuable. Bitcoin is something that could go up in value or spontaneously people could stop caring about it and your gold is worth nothing. There is no security in bitcoin
Lol I like it how you mention that gold and bitcoin fluctuate but conveniently forget to mention that Bitcoin fluctuates a hell of a lot more than Gold. Bitcoin really isn't like Gold and people don't treat it like Gold, Bitcoin is far too unstable to be treated like Gold. 
It’s literally too unstable to be used as currency. Pretty ironic. 
"Except as long as the prices remain this high bitcoin will continue to have transaction fees above $25 and wait times half a day or more long.  
  
The price of bitcoin rising literally makes both of these issues worse. Bitcoin is a failure of a currency at this level, and there is no substance to back up its insane value.

"How is LN better than a centralized network?

By definition it can't be faster or more efficient. The only conceivable argument is ""security"" and ""decentralization"", but LN will require a high degree of centralization to be functional, and centralized networks are already more than secure enough to meet the needs of users, plus they're backed by government protections.
"
No one knows what will happen.  I would prefer a situation where the world doesn't end as we know it.  That will require the powers that may be to get with the times and introduce proper regulation.  A thousand years from now I doubt fiat will be a thing, so if you live that long you may see a day where central banks are no longer relevant.  :)
"I mined Bitcoin on my CPU via a website in 2009. Worked for an exchange from 2012-2014. Don't tell me I haven't been around the scene.

Bitcoin isn't what it used to be and it's not coming back. It's an asset/commodity now. I even watched the Bitcoin store on Wall Street be built (Not sure if it's still there? Doubt it?) and bought Bitcoin from an ATM there.

I tried to buy a VPN from PIA yesterday and noticed they removed Bitcoin in favor of BCH and ZCash. Not good signs when your coin stops being accepted.

"I feel that many of the people shitting on crypto recently have not even tried to gain an understanding of how the technology works and adamantly refuse to even try. 

Education is the key people. The more these people who spread false rumors and information the more it sinks into the mainstream creating a black cloud over it all. Just look at this last week. The only way to counter this is to make the technology terms palatable while also not framing it in traditional ideologies like “mining”, “gold”, “stocks” etc.

Simply put there hasn’t been a good analogy of crypto currency because nothing has existed like this before. It’s a new frontier and we’ve definitely not seen even the tip of what it can eventually become."

"Can you explain what makes Bitcoin have value other than people getting together and agreeing it's valuable? I know the dollar isn't backed by anything but it's still the currency for trading oil (giving it a tremendous amount of weight). What substance does bitcoin have other than being an ""alternative"" currency?"
If you look at it like Gold or another commodity rather than a stock it definitely makes more sense. People are literally treating it like gold, it fluctuates, it's finite etc... Bitcoin is our digital version of Gold. 
Would you mind sharing that source?
Since the amount of cryptos that can exist is infinite they can totally tackle that volume between all the ones that are not yet overloaded plus DAG based distributed ledgers might end up working in the future. One thing is for sure complicated opt in tech like the lightning network will surely disappoint like segwit adoption has.
The banking organizations don't necessarily want to be involved in crypto. They are more or less forced to, when their private clients are calling and asking about it, they have no choice but to offer that service or their clients will leave and find someone who will. That's why they are setting up dedicated crypto desks on their trading floors.
That's literally what disruption means

Sure. And at some point these will slow down as more and more people can spot these actions and make plays on those attempts. Let's call it whale hunting.

I was an early investor in Bitcoin. I know the community inside out. With that said, Bitcoin was designed to buy a cup of coffee. In fact it was designed to be used throughout the world for everything. Bitcoin only became a store of value when blockstream crippled the coin by not increasing the blocksize. Yes I know, your going to call me a Bitcoin Cash shill, but couldn’t they have just raised the block size until the shit “lightning network” is complete? You sound like someone that bought in to get rich real fast. Bitcoin was NEVER meant to be a store of value. It was designed to be a world wide currency!

So... what's to stop you from removing Bitcoin from the equation altogether? Does the actual Bitcoin, and the enormous environmental drain that comes with it, even have a point with LN? It's also a fundamental departure from the technological foundation of Bitcoin and the Blockchain. 
"You're not in control of the gold in that scenario. In the Lightning network, you can close the channel at any time and resume control of your asset.

The LN doesn't hold your bitcoin. It just routes it and establishes the connection to the intended merchant."
Yes. It is a very clearly unique coin - but that does not give it any intrinsic value, does it?
gold can be used to produce something. bitcoins just contribute to global warming by burning energy without cause.
Also wonder about that, but gold builds stuff.  Bitcoin isn't actually good for it's purported purpose. As a currency it fluctuates too wildly, and transaction costs are astronomical.
Blogs so hard mothafuckas wanna fine me 
Just ask /r/buttcoin 
But it's not really being used as a form of payment. The transaction fees and price jumping up and down means nobody spending any bitcoins, everyone is just holding on to them
If one day, people's paychecks are in say digital money, like ethereum, then I can see how you can borrow against your future salary in automated smart contracts, and loans will be garnished from wages automatically. Also Bloom is a coin that gets credit ratings on the blockchain.

How are the miners involved in the transactions in LN? Or maybe they aren't? I thought miners secured the transactions.
That's not how it works. The mining difficulty auto-scales so that on average 1 block is mined every 10 minutes. Throwing more computing power at it just makes the mining difficulty harder, and removing power makes the difficulty easier. We could make every computer in the world mine, and there would still be 6 blocks per hour mined on average.
Patience
things like that take time. give it another 5-10 years
At this point I believe the space is too big to fail.  Digital currencies will come and go, but the decentralized concept is here to stay.  Finding a way to regulate and tax this ever-evolving space is the new objective for government(s).  I argue that crypto is already seen as a viable investment and certainly more exciting than a boring portfolio of equities/fixed income.
[deleted]
"The Bitcoin blockchain only allows so many transactions per block, and there's only one block every 10 minutes.

If you don't offer a high enough fee your transaction will never complete because other people are willing to pay the high fees and the miners will use the limited space in the blocks for those transactions with the higher fees instead of yours. The demand for transactions right now is much higher than the available space, so the competition has driven the fee up really high.

As for why the Bitcoin blockchain only allows so many transactions per block, and why the number is what it is... that's a much deeper issue."
Well it's no wonder no one takes them seriously.
Adoption by the regular people of this world who don't want to rule over their neighbor will some day put the central banks out of business.
"Sounds somewhat delusional. Either there’s a psyop going on to make it seem like it’s insecure by reporting all these exchange hacks, or they really are secure options, hard to say.  One thing I do know is I’d never trust the central banks. The Fed isn’t even a federal bank and they are privately owned, it’s a racket but seriously, the whole point of crypto is to get the fuck away from central banks having the influence they do over the globe for centuries. 

This is some new world order they weren’t exactly planning on, and they’re in meltdown mode figuring out how to make it fail before it becomes viewed as a viable investment. 

When they wheel out Jamie Dimon (how the fuck is this guy not in jail) to shit talk crypto and bitcoin, you know they’re threatened.

"That's the thing though - it does not have any value in itself. It has nothing backing it. Currency is backed by economies that have to accept said currency, stocks are backed by the company they are from, giving you a degree of ownership and all the perks that come with it.  
Bitcoin and other crypto doesn't have any of that. It's basically a bunch of people agreeing ""Yeah, we will use these conceptual coins to do business"" - with no guarantee that they will continue to do so tomorrow, no value backing it, nothing. The only thing backing Bitcoin is the faith of holders that it will still be worth anything tomorrow."

That is precisely the reason all of my liquid wealth is in crypto.  Adoption by central banks will ultimately be a good thing.
Eventually, the horse and buggy must make way for the automobile.
"That's not the network transaction fee you're looking at, that's the exchange cut.

Creating an actual transaction on the network costs you. [Here's a website that tracks how many satoshi per byte people are offering miners to get their transactions confirmed](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/).

For the current median transaction size of 226 bytes, the fee for creating a transaction (moving Bitcoin from wallet to another wallet, so for example moving Bitcoin from your wallet to an exchange) is 2.192 mBTC, which right now based on the Coindesk price is $33.71 USD.

If you wanted to buy a Pepsi with Bitcoin, you'd be paying what the Pepsi costs, and $33.71 for the transaction."
"When you work on an exchange you are not making transactions. The exchange handles those things internally. When you transfer from one bitcoin wallet to another, you are making a transaction. That's the kind of transaction you can find here https://blockexplorer.com/
"
"Your point? 

Is this a common trope here? Can’t make an argument so bitcoiners just throw out slogans or make wide sweeping generalizations?"
It's still very beta, but it's coming along nicely and should have no problems scaling. It's already handled thousands of tx/s under stress testing. 
You open a channel to the network, then you have cheap transactions, and when you need to settle up, you close. Closing the channel goes to the miners, and it attracts a fee. The idea is that you would settle about as often as you would open a bank account. 
The way I understand it is that you open a channel to the lightning network and then conduct transfers off the blockchain until it is economical or otherwise necessary to record the many transactions you made on the blockchain. That way lots of small transactions can be processed like one big transaction. I believe there are miners verifying transactions on the LN as well. 
"Who holds the numbers matters less than how the value of the numbers is secured.

Having the private keys for your own bitcoin won't matter if a mining group gets 51% hash power, or miners move on to another currency, or quantum computing breaks the encryption that bitcoin relies on. You don't hold what is valuable at any point, which is the network of miners and the security of the technology.

Something like Bitgold has multiple layers of value security, the first one being the value of gold which you can redeem and hold physically, the second being insurance for the gold in its vaults, and the third is the power of law to enforce the contract and regulate their behavior, which will last for as long as the government does.

As long as Bitgold is up and running you can redeem your numbers for actual gold, and since you're only using bitgold to pay/receive then you wouldn't have most of your savings in their system anymore than you would have most of your bitcoin on an exchange.

Closing a ""channel"" might take more time with gold, but the underlying value is much more secure and the fees are lower, and the payment system is faster and more reliable.

For the record I don't think any deflationary currency is a good idea, I think using gold as currency is a waste of gold, but if centralization of payment is the solution to bitcoins problems, I don't see why we need bitcoin.

>BitGold Corporate By-Laws states that any customer transaction that is carried out must be commenced in their segregated subsidiary BitGold Vault Inc. The Corporation is required to buy or sell assayed and stamped .9995 pure or better bullion-grade gold for customers from an approved list in which their gold meets the minimum specification set by the London Bullion Market or New York Mercantile Exchange division Commodity Exchange resulting in the settlement of each metric gram, kilogram or tonne of physical gold. All vaulted gold must maintain adequate insurance coverage for every customer, in which the current insurance provider is ""BRINKS"". All account holders are allowed upon request real-time ""audits"" of their physical gold bullion, this is done through the corporation’s patent pending technology ""aurum"", in which an encrypted digital copy is sent to a third party auditor to conduct the audit at the vault custodian ensuring the reported gold is reconciled through physical inspection."

Lightning network. Basically instead of actually trading bitcoin for small transactions you are just trading bitcoin on paper. It’s like having a layer on top of bitcoin.

"If you can trust a centralized payment processor, why not just trade a decentralized asset like gold on a centralized processor (like bitgold)?

If its the centralization of the underlying currency that concerns you, and not the payment processing, then gold mining is much more decentralized than bitcoin mining, and its underlying value is much harder to destroy. 

That would also have the benefit that there's no 51% attack for gold mines, and that if all the gold mines in the world shut down to go mine a more profitable metal, it wouldn't make gold worthless overnight."
Gonna admit, I wooshed too
Decentralized Blockchain and mathematically backed protocol.
Very true, and I'm not saying Bitcoin SHOULD be the Gold standard of the internet but it is right now. There are billions of Dollars being stored in Bitcoin. So sure, you can see things like Bitcoin Cash happen but that doesn't mean everyone dumped their holding and run to BCH when it's clearly the more superior tech. There is a lot at play here that has yet to be discovered. 
Wow, you obviously know nothing about mining gold.
"lmao not arguing against the BTC pitfalls, but gold costs nothing for the environment? Gold requires *real world* mining which is even worse for the environment, requires the use of slaves to mine (to this very day, albeit they're wage slaves now that work for pennies on the dollar instead of the original native american slaves that paid for European expansion in blood) and also requires trucks and other automotives to transfer just like any other large amount of a heavy ass thing when you've got enough of it.

They're both pretty shit, which is why we have fiat instead of either. "
Mining gold took no resources?

If I can hold fedcoin in my hardware wallet and it is stable it would be better than going to fiat on an exchange during times of uncertainty.  Fiat backed with cryptoassets will probably be a good thing.

How is bitcoin competing with it though? It's being treated as an asset not a currency. Nobody is actually using it for buying stuff, they're just selling it when it's high so they can make Dollars (or pounds, euros, etc.)
Lol
Or bit coin is being used to normalize the idea of electronic currency so the government can implement a cashless society and continue to make valueless currency held up by perseption. 
2024, the internet collectively runs for executive office.

Not with these banking fees
we won't need public office where we're going
That guy has aged better than anyone I’ve ever seen, what’s his secret?
Run for office? That was last year.
Of course its unstable it will only be stable when its worth zero or when its adopted by a large portion of the population. Does it really need to be stable? I have no problem with it going up and down in value because I believe in the long term growth of Bitcoin. I might be wrong but I think it’s well worth the risk.

Name one advantage bitcoin has for the average consumer over a credit card. Because I can name a ton of advantages a credit card has over bitcoin. Overthrow is laughably strong. Even competition is overstating it. 
Peer to peer lending 
"Actually firms are setting up for loans, financing and such on blockchain. 

Not sure what they'll use to decide rates and how to collect. "
You’ll leverage your crypto assets for a loan through something like SALT if someone hasn’t developed blockchain credit or mortgages by then (I’m sure it’s not far off).
It isn't lightning hubs will be provided by institutional investors imo xD
Becuase one day in the future if you keep your coins in say.... freewallet or coinbase they will give you crypto loans... just like Saltcoin. 
Salt
Folks will eventually get mortgages using block chain technology.
There are lending platforms for some coins I think lol

I am shocked at how some people can take so little and get such an ego with it. You didn't overthrow anything. Most people will still use dollar bills instead of highly volatile crypto currencies that can lose all value in minutes. Basically all cryptocurrencies did is introduce a new form of stocks and stocks hardly overthrew banks
OP have you ever used a meme before? 
Wow the FUD is real in here.  See you toolate suckers in 2020.
The powers that be are going to pull the plug on the internet soon. Things are getting too far.
"CryptoCoins will just enable the existing system to load off some legacy burocracy and come out leaner and more powerful, at least the ones who bring good products out to the market first. 

Everyone who thinks cryptos will magically make corrupt banks disappear has no clue how technological revolutions work. Fools with tools are just fools, and 99% of people who vote, consume, use traditional banks will not magically switch to new non bank non governmental systems. 

And to everyone thinking cryptos mainly are helping poor citizens oppressed by capitalism just think about WHO actually is profiting from all these gains the most. Just keep in mind that all these dark web weapons child porn drug dealers paid in cryptos are probably all rich as fuck now."

How are you going to overthrow the banking system when your average transfer fee is 30.00? On top of that, it takes hours to confirm? Is this really practical? I would rather use PayPal, western Union, and any other service before I used Bitcoin. 
You guys realize since Bitcoin is slowly becoming (or in fact, already has) not a currency and more of an asset/commodity you're never going to take over USD? Right? 
Bitcoin isn't going to overthrow the banking system. It's not even a currency anymore. Bitcoin is a speculative commodity these days.
The correct word is 'disrupt'. Also I love Harold.
How is Bitcoin going to replace the banks when I need a mortage for my house? 
Lighting network will not solve anything. Nobody is going to open up payment channels for hundreds of dollars. It will end up high fees and centralized. 
P2P Lending. Instead of shopping a few banks in search of the lowest interest rate, you could get a loan from anyone on the planet.

"Had a conversation with my wife’s grandfather yesterday. 

He’s a major doubter of Cryptocurrencies. Which I cannot get across to him the idea that there are more things beside bitcoin. Doesn’t matter the statistics I bring in front of him, to him it’s the equivalent of going down to the Casino and dropping $1000 on the roulette table. 

He told me yesterday, “Bitcoin lost 30% this week, I don’t know how anyone can see that as anything other than a gamble.” 

Yeah, sure, if you bought a week ago you lost 30%. If you bought a month ago you made 91%. If you bought a year ago you made 1600%. And, I’m barely even in fucking bitcoin. I didn’t lose 30% this week. Despite the entire market crashing I wasn’t even down, I was up 3% yesterday. And today I’m sitting pretty. 

His major argument is, “My Merrill Lynch financial advisor strongly advises against Bitcoin, and he has never steered me wrong in the past”. 

Dude, OF COURSE HE DOESNT WANT YOU IN BITCOIN. If your money is in Bitcoin, how does he make commissions on that money? 

I really don’t know how to make him see that it’s at least a semi-reasonable investment. Understanding that it’s risky but it’s completely revolutionary technology and the idea of a global decentralized currency is in my eyes inevitable. "

YOU DON'T KNOW YOUR OWN GOD? /r/youdontsurf
Bitcoin is a place you store wealth like gold. Bitcoin is the core of Blockchain and crypto. You then transfer that gold to buy other currencies. I bought crypto kittens with etherium for example. Bought some fun tokens for future use in their casino and for investment. If I wanted to, I could buy a super car with bitcoin. Lots of shit can be bought with bitcoin. People are hodling because of transfer fees mostly and time. It’s almost a joke to make money in crypto. Once lightning gets implemented it will be an accepted retail currency. Crypto is being used as currency, it’s just niche and specialized transactions right now. 
I... don’t think you understand how bitcoin overthrows banking
Dude, you're the classic clueless voice in this sub. You people are morons.
"Now.. its being qualified as an asset because that is a strategy by central banks to contain it. They also dont understand the tech. Its also all still in early beta. Overtime, crypto will transition from its ""gold"" asset, speculative alt trading,  into 1.0 mature micro exchanges with mass market adoption (amazon, ebay, etc.. not just userbase) at which point one of two things will happen, or both.. the status quo adjusts their legal frame work to work with the dominant tech of the future (ie Japan) or they loose their shit and refuce to accept it and most likely get dragged into it reluctsntly kicking and screaming after the whole world already jumped in. Sadly, its the bigger economies like the eu and us that will likely drag their feet the most. War is more likely than open embracing it. Its going to be a rocky few years.. but expect big events, say russia and china trading oil in crytpo (even if state backed coins), mass adoption of decentralized exchanges, etc. Progress in the crypto realm will come from periphery economies, like Venezuela, Japan, etc who stand to gain more than to loose from crypto adoption."
The idea I've seen people talk about is that it grows massive, bubbles, and on the decline people spend it, which will lead to stability after happening a few times. The only issue is, nobody knows shit because this is unprecedented so even people who claim to be Bitcoin experts are talking out of their ass. Like I am right now. 
"Computers started becoming more widely used in the late 90's early 2000's. Bitcoin has only been out since about 2009. 

From what I gather is that we've only had this much information and technology at our fingertips for about 17 years and we're hearing spam posters talking as if bitcoin is supposed to be taking over Fiat and government by now but due to high fees, it's failing at that. "

People noting that crypto has been used for criminal activities is literally the most stupid argument against it I’ve ever heard. The entire world of corrupt politicians, drug lords, corporations, drug dealers, etc. has forever existed and operated using fiat just fine.

"Yup, banks are setting up crypto labs all over the place and even have blockchain prototypes running between them to test bank to bank transactions.

They and the governements will eventually move from the current fiat money to cryptos."
Sure but in 50 years how do you know what people will use? The way you think is VERY similar to what people thought about the internet in the early 90's. Why not give something new a shot? Why not try to make things better instead of refusing change and being stuck in a broken system? I'm not saying BTC is a good system. Right now it is not. But nothing is perfect at first. It takes time and improvements. Don't be so closed minded. 
"Why do you assume that's what he meant? Computers only started to get popular among the general population and considered useful in the 2000's. 

Edit: Perhaps popular wasn't the best word, I meant being the norm in normal (non-IT) households and used daily.  "
Well aside from the kiddie porn I’m perfectly ok with that. 
The fact that these currencies are utilized as payment on the dark web means there is no stopping it.  The sad reality is that sex trafficking, drug dealing, and all other illegal activities are omnipresent in human society.  We might as well accept it and find light in the darkness of its utilization.  The more traction this digital currency space gets, the more positive its impact will be as it is put to better use - transcending government control and creating a free market with global recognition.  In this day in age, global recognition and valuation is a very rare concept.
if the powers that be didn't want us to have a global communication and financial network to subvert localized authoritarian dictators across the globe, then they wouldn't have set one up expressly for that purpose to begin with.
There are technical reasons that make that basically impossible 
"How are they gonna do that if it's decentralized?... Seems to me that would as successful as how they stopped mp3-trading, bit-torrent or TOR. (IE = they didn't/cant). 

The thing is though.. it's not just about Bitcoin in isolation. It's crypto-currencies and blockchain in all their diverse forms. The manifestations we have now may not be the final forms.. but the advantages of digital currencies (encryption, decentralization,etc) cannot be fought against. They will win eventually. I'm not sure what form they will be when they win.. but they will. "

That's the joke. Harold is a decade or two too late.
While all governments are shit, wealth that cannot be taxed is a public infrastructure nightmare. Cryptos solve some problems and bring another. Blockchain is truly the golden egg among all these, it can fix a lot of problems and can with right infrastructure be a global standard currency, upon which all fiat can fix their values on.

All these replies pitching their next generation blockchains should tell you that this really won’t be an issue going forward.  BTC itself is a store of value but I’m not going to buy a cup of coffee with it obviously.  I’ll use one of those third generation pow no fee coins to do that.

"Bitcoin's only value was from its utility as a currency. It currently has roughly no utility whatsoever as a currency because of the insane volatility, transaction fees, and wait times.  
  "
Banks have fees up the ass for random things, they own your money, and it takes a week for a transaction to go through. Cryptos, when done right, will put your money in your own hands and transact instantly at low or no cost. We have not yet perfected the tech, so right now its not very good competition, but it has potential.
"That's not how it got here.  Those of us that have been around bitcoin for a few years, have used it to buy stuff.  It's only recently where the fees have made that more burdensome.  A lot of people bought bitcoin as it was needed, didnt use it to ""make Dollars"""
Bitcoin by itself? probably not. It will probably be a store of value like gold. More like a crypto-asset. But other crypto currencies might help to do it one day. We are still early into this.
