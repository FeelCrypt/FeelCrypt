I've been watching this, upvote counts rapidly going up by the second. Obvious brigading
Getting downvoted for stating a simple fact. Typical

I'd wager 1BCH r/bitcoin was intentionally flooded (with the direction of a hired pro PR team) with memes to distract people from the serious issues that plagued the project.
Yes :) But we will win in the End.
"Flakvinge, as I wrote above I bet r/bitcoin, with the direction of pro consultants, has been intentionally flooded with memes to distract people from the serious issues that plagued the project. It's something like an [intentional idiocracy](https://imgur.com/bNERgLj) going on over there.

I go to the front page for humor.
I'm only interested in crypto-currencies and not crypto-blockchains.
Well, I think privacy is an important thing for a currency, so I think Monero is quite interesting.
"No one ‚Äústole‚Äù the name.
When the fork happened, core won the majority, therefore it remained bitcoin.
That doesn‚Äôt make core better tho.

I support BCH and consider it the ‚Äòoriginal bitcoin‚Äô, but no one ‚Äústole‚Äù the name bitcoin from anyone ffs."

Inflationary.
I think mixers are sufficient. Just mix once to a new wallet and newer connect yourself to that wallet by using TOR and not giving personal info. Then you can use that wallet for private transactions.
Core just won the majority because of propaganda and censorship. So yes they stole the name Bitcoin. It belongs to the original whitepaper and not to an LN project.
"""Fork"" says it all. "

Good tech, but still to resource heavy to work on mobile and to have privacy be on by default on the desktops. So, possibly something for the future, when the tech have matured.
Don't see the problem here....
All the busts on darknet shows the opposite. Governments have become quite good tracking coins through mixers. And even if you take all the precautions, you only need one slip up to lose your privacy.
Mixers are like switching from addition to logarithms hoping slide rulers are never invented.
"Whoever you think is more deserving of the name is irrelevant. As I said I support BCH over core and think it is much closer to the ‚Äòoriginal bitcoin‚Äô, so I agree with you.

But, this is an argument over semantics.  No one ‚Äústole‚Äù the name from anyone. That is a fact.

They may not deserve the name and they may not have acquired it in the most fair way, but again *no one stole it*, so stop repeating this bullshit without really thinking about it.

It‚Äôs kinda like saying Trump stole the presidency. No, he won it. He may not deserve it and it‚Äôs obviously unfortunate that he won, and he may have used unfair practices and propaganda to do so, but he didn‚Äôt steal the presidency and he is still the president whether he should be or not. You can kind of equate that to this situation. 

Edit: words"

He has been posting some serious Nazi shit at me as well. Saying that Jews have been terrible throughout history.
"Core intentionally broadcasted wrong information about bitcoin: for example about nonmining fullnodes. This is a reason why people think LN is good for Bitcoin. So when I say they ""stole"" the name Bitcoin, I mean they got it trough broadcasting wrong information, propaganda and censorship. They would not have the communitysupport and the brand if they didn't do propaganda and censorship. Its like Hitler winning in 1933."
They're worth nothing unless you're selling accounts anyway. Nobody besides marketers give a shit about other people's karma totals. Also, shitposting is not a good way to earn.
">Its like Hitler winning in 1933.

It's like almost any battle between two sides where large communities of people are involved.

Whoever manages to slander the other side and push false propaganda more effectively will win by swaying the most people. I'm sure BCH used some similar tactics to help gain traction on their side too.

Saying that core stole the name implies a lot of things that aren't necessarily true, especially to those who aren't as informed.

>I mean they got it trough broadcasting wrong information, propaganda and censorship.

This is pretty much how everything is achieved these days, unfortunately... That's why I referenced the US presidency as a comparison. And yeah, I don't like it either."
BCH is Bitcoin. Bitcoin Core is a SegWit + LN Project which stole the name Bitcoin. 
It is a shame what happened to the Boy Scouts.  It reminds me of exactly what happened to Bitcoin BTC.
Not even slightly subtle. 
"Did that too and only BCH was left. I think a lot of people just feel like they‚Äôre too late for the established cryptos and then fall for the promises new cryptos make just because they want them to be true.
I really wanted to diversify but I always came to the conclusion that nothing else makes sense."
"This shitpost with 0 content and very few comments got more votes than any other post. The bots are on a rampage. 

We should move to memo.cash"
This belongs on r/bitcoin, stupid memes are not the flavour here. 
"Why is this getting up voted?

I this is the second day something which offers the community little value has been pushed up."
This is a bizarre post.
Ehh... Nope, I did my due diligence and examined the projects and their tech, and then there are not many badges left...
I personally have no problem with a good meme here every once in a while.  I was that kid when I first got into Bitcoin....before abandoning Bitcoin Core for Bitcoin Cash (although I do still own a few of the more solid coins).
"It is true that many people, including myself, invested in a bunch of shitty cryptocurrencies when they first came in to this space. This is no surprise considering the fact that now for the first time in human history, almost any individual around the world has the opportunity to invest in a revolutionary technology.

Before cryptocurrencies, investment was limited to regulated exchanges/technologies/firms. If you treat the entire world as children by telling them what they can and can't do with their money, of course these people will never get a chance to grow up and face the consequences of their own decisions. 

One of the interesting side effects of cryptocurrencies, apart from it separating money and state, is that it's forcing people to educate themselves in economics, investing & responsibilities. Alternatively people can put part of their wealth in a cryptocurrency investment fund and pay someone else to do the due diligence. However, the individual himself will still need to make a good judgement call on which fund to join.

I personally don't believe making memes like this is going to help the space a lot. I think it will mainly create a divide between the maximalists and the more open minded people. I think if you really want people to make better judgement calls you should enhance the projects that you support or create a better one yourself, and advocate for those.

Moreover, I think it's not even clear what defines Bitcoin. Is it the chain with the most accumulated proof of work, or the chain that best resembles peer-to-peer electronic cash? I think both have compelling arguments. Considering that there is still a very large proportion of the market that thinks the former, one could argue that Bitcoin Cash is just another altcoin. I think the term altcoin shouldn't even be used. As if there can only be one true cryptocurrency and the rest is fundamentally different. How can you hold those views and at the same time believe in open-source projects and free market competition?"
"I hate the term altcoin or alt-coin. It presupposes a primary coin. BTC is not that important anymore. There are just coins. However there are still shit coins. (‚Ä¢_‚Ä¢)  
( ‚Ä¢_‚Ä¢)>‚åê‚ñ†-‚ñ†  
(‚åê‚ñ†_‚ñ†)"
At least this brigading is clearly not astroturfing.
Haha too funny...especially because BCH is an altcoin. 
#tokenboi
 I think that DPOS+BFT consensus mechanism can give more for the future of cryptoworld and will be used more often further. Have a look at CREDITS, the basis of CS- DPOS+BFT, and it helps greatly to provide more effective actions, they listed all features in their own article about the principle of work of this consensus, it was placed on Medium. 
Cool 
Haha..nice..üòÇ
When you first discovered shitcoins

I sure hope so!!!
Lmao it's The Mighty B
I don't think they mean it against BCH
Why are they pushing up comedy cemetery-like stuff on the sub? I'm guessing they're trying to make the sub look un-serious and take away from any professional discussion going on here. Perhaps they're trying to make the sub be off-putting at first glance to serious people looking here for the first time.
Because most people have a sense of humour, present company excluded of course.
But Reddit won't do anything to stop these.
I'm thinking the same thing. This isn't even an altcoin community, so having anything altcoin related on the front page is out of place.
I smell brigading at its finest.
"Agreed 
A lot of stupid r/bitcoin style memes flooding r/btc for the past week. üòí"
