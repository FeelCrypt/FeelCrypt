It reads as bitch please and 99.9% of ppl will see it that way. 
Dude !! lol your car it will be so Burned soon !! what a idiot :)))
Which Nissan is it?

"Obviously, isnâ€™t that what the meme reads?
Ironically my mom thought it said bitcoin plus lmao"
That's fine, that's the joke anyway.
Yeah I'm surprised they even allowed this plate to be made.
That's exactly one of the reasons why I like the [BIT-bit system](https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8k5ne0/proposal_makes_bits_1_millionth_bch_the_standard/) proposal.
Good bot
"I've become too damaged and automatically associate any reference to ""bitch please"" with bitcoin cash :S"

"Lmaooooo I didnâ€™t say I have bch but I support it ;)"
And they know you have bch and likely have seed words somewhere in your house. Idk if I'm paranoid but I wouldn't put a photo like this online
NY is like the FL of the east coast

"Did you reply with ""bitch, please?"" that would be perfect"
" Bitcoin Plus is real Bitcoin Cash ðŸ™ƒ

 Bitcoin Plus does have a cool ticker, XBC.."
No way should we change our ticker to anything but BTC.
But... NY and FL are both on the east coast...
Giving FL too much credit there

Make sure to get a window sticker with your wallet ID ðŸ˜…
Nice!
Not a fan of either core or cash in particular, both are relics imo, but it's kind of funny the core post license plates of Mercedes and Aston Martins and the bch one is a .....2011? Altima
I've seen this before, just not on a NY plate.
"great! BCH rules!

Seems lots of people get bitched these days reading the comment "
I can't believe that's not a lambo. 
awesome
I'm jealous!  Anyone got FL yet??
I have exactly same plate :D going to upload a photo of it this weekend
I drive the same car and love bch as well, neat.

I'm surprised they allowed it. I think I read a post here saying they tried but it got denied. Cool to see you get it though!
"Until someone reads that as Bitch please and complains about how that is sexually harassing their 3 year old.

I like it though"
>when your lambo is a 2006 altima
"Damn, that could've been me.

Maybe i'll see you around the city."
"I have been so annoyed by the amount of time it takes to clear the funds that have already been cleared in my wallet. Is reconfirming the whole wallet necessary. Serious adoption issue, and I have been living off of only using crypto the last four years. 

The bitpay card is great but needs to be more efficient. Block times or not, it's the main issue. "
