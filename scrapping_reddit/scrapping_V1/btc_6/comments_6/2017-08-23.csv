"I think 80% is usually a good threshold.  It really depends on the people in the group though and how many loud voices (and personalities) there are drowning out others.

The one thing that has troubled me about some of the people who have rage quit core and caused so much damage in this space afterwards, is that often they are soooo technically adept and so used to being the commander-in-chief from corporate environments like Google etc. that when you put them in a situation where they have no more power than anyone else they often get frustrated.  They can see why they are technically right, but because they have to spend so much time explaining it to others (and often the most technically adept are the least adept socially) they often end up giving an ultimatum of ""my way or the high way"".  

The reason it's important that we spend all that time to reach consensus though is so that no one man or woman can become that commander-in-chief and drown out the quieter ones.  Similar to how Jury's have to reach wide consensus in court cases in that respect since the stake - a man or woman's freedom - is often so high.  The stakes with bitcoin are *quite literally* that high when we think of all the lives (and assets) it is securing in places like Venezuela this very moment.

Finally, the other key to all this is the diversity operating to consensus creates (some 200+ devs have contributed to core).  When everyone feels they have a voice and can come in and contribute (and leave) at any time, you don't then have to worry about the commander-in-chief getting bored, having a bad day or suffering from burnout since new energy is constantly coming in to replenish the group as a whole, who are then able to pick up the slack and push good ideas everyone has agreed on forward, together."
"I think you do know, 

LN requires the person receiving the payment, the person sending the payment, and all hubs and persons in between to be online in order for a transaction to go through. So LN is obviously trash "
"In bitcoin, just like the W3C working groups that keep making the internet more awesome, there is a place where your opinions on technical issues will be discussed, listened to and acted upon if they're good.  

Shouting in the reddit about technical issues is kinda' like going into r/internet and expecting those working through new HTML draft proposals to pay attention (close to zero W3C working group members will likely be in the reddit).

It took a long time even for the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal system to evolve (BIP itself was at one time just one persons idea - that's how easy it is to get heard if you truly want to help out!)."

Another very inspiring post, thank you!"
"> Bitcoin isn't supposed to be anything, it's a technology.

That's nonsense. The intention of the original developers was pretty clear, and even laid out in the white paper.  To completely disregard that to make it okay that a select few hijacked the entire system is insane.

> Does the internet care what that FB group is doing? What is the spirit of the internet?

That's an awful analogy.  The Internet was build to deliver whatever users on top of it wanted.  It was, is, and always will be entirely agnostic to things like FB.  And to top it all off you say that users shouldn't have a say in what the Internet should be which is just the worst.  I bet you support everything net neutrality advocates are fighting against. And again, that is against the intent of its creator just like the state of Bitcoin today."
LN is a joke, we will see it. Eclair wallet connected to a hard-coded address(like connected to payment hub instead of another peer). Even with this, it still lacks ability to receive fund. Big payment hub make it easy to find another peer, but it still didn't demo P2P payment, why? LN is far from complete and you core fans will disappoint about how it resolve high-fee problem in the near future.

"Totally :) And it's through the myriad shitty jobs I did (data entry / tech support) that made me one day swear to myself ""I'm gonna' start my own company.""  I gotta say though, even the shitty jobs I kinda enjoyed, when working for yourself, you sometimes miss the office camaraderie and being able to say ""Fuck it, not my problem!"" at 5.30 :p

So going into business for yourself brings a whole new bunch of issues like being so in love with your work you can easily end up doing 80hrs a week and forgetting to eat / sleep properly / enjoy life.

That is the key though, work on something you love and it's no longer work.  Just don't get too addicted to it and don't let money be the chief incentive behind you and your ideas ;)  

There are so many opportunities now on the net for people with skills like yours though, it's really never been easier to find a group of people with an idea and go take on the world!

Face it dude, this guy didn't do shit to get him permabanned beyond offend people.  He wasn't shilling.  He is a real person who obviously believes differently than the people who banned him.  And that is the only reason they banned him.  He isn't a bot.
That's because he is incentivized by the block reward profitability to act in his own rational self-interest. To even act *against* his bias. That is the beauty of Bitcoin (and now Bitcoin Cash). It relies upon the greed of others to function property.

Does the internet care what that FB group is doing?  What is the spirit of the internet?  I'm with the EFF and net neutrality but the RIAA probably don't agree with what I think the internet is, so it's all very subjective isn't it.

In truth it matters not what EFF or RIAA think the internet is; since it will evolve as a result of all the good engineers that help build it and the demands humanity as a whole make upon it.

This will all come down to the cool things we build with bitcoin, and the things people use it for to make their lives better, not some reddit group or the people arguing in it.  Truth is 90% of the people doing the actual work aren't even active participants in the reddit group.

But the real beauty of all this, is if anyone disagrees with any of that, they're free to start another group and take the 7 years worth of core code and try something different.  

But they'll still have to build cool stuff that people actually wanna' use :)

Only the nodes who do PoW, the other nodes just flow, they they can't secure the network they can just chose not to flow. There is no rule in the bitcoin design that says a valid transactions become invalid when all transactions in a block with a valid PoW exceeds 1MB. 

Core nodes are not rational enforcing a transaction limit.

I feel quite the opposite.  People like myself and many others in this space from the beginning have quite literally put our lives and liberty on the line when we said ""we refuse to accept that things have to be this way"".

My interest in bitcoin has always been about changing the way things are and making the world a better place by helping to empower your generation with the right tools and ideas to help us rebuild things anew.

However, there has been a big problem with Gen-Y vs. Baby Boomers who don't understand each other (with my Gen-X stuck right in the middle).

So then the question is: 

""OK so we exist in a world run by corporations but how can we use them to our advantage and help make them think about their impact on the world so that they can redeploy their considerable skills / reach and money to help reduce the income inequality and greed that lead to the near collapse of Civilisation?""

Bitcoin is the key, however we must all exercise patience as both your generation, mine, and the boomers figure out how to open all the doors.

If you don't want to use LN, then just use the main chain... no problem. (or use an alt, and stop bitching about what Bitcoin is doing)

But when it comes to that other sub I doubt I'll ever stop informing people how it has been coopted and censored. Why not? Let the truth be free."
My side? Oh come on it's not black and white. As I said it's just not possible to do all everyday transactions on a blockchain. There is a huge overhead and the database needs to be synchronized globally. You can't even delete old transactions. Because of all of this it's just not possible to have really cheap transactions. Buying coffee with Bitcoin sounded cool but we found out that this is not possible (not without a second layer at least) Bitcoin is really good for sending money across borders and evading regulations. Bitcoin (but even more Zcash/Monero) is really good to buy something without your bank knowing.
"""I've used the LN test net to buy virtual coffee, and it was a pretty seamless and easy experience.""

Ah...so you are involved in LN, now your illogical opinion is beginning to make sense. It is actually not illogical at all....you are one of the people that seeks to profit off of this atrocious abomination.

I would instead focus on how I can deploy my skills to actually do positive work for those I enjoy being around, and to focus on what is best for the overall project that we call bitcoin.  In the same way I don't spend my day worrying about what etherum or monero are up to.  Alts too, have different ideas based on a different 'truth' as to where this might all go.

It works brilliantly, when this is working on the main net, other coins will look archaic. 

Nobody paid me you clown. 

The main Bitcoin chain isn't unusable. Sure fees are high at the moment... which is exactly why the bulk of transactions are soon to be moved off chain.

"""It really is comical how everyone on this sub immediately switches to paranoid mode, thinking I'm a paid shill"" 

Honestly, Occam's Razor, You being a shill is the only logical solution. 

LN is clearly inferior. It has crippling drawbacks. The centralized hubs replicate banks. It is absolutely not what we want. For someone to continue to illogically keep saying it is a good thing, can really only mean two things:

1. You are 100% technically/economically illiterate and literally do not have the first clue what is going on, basically just repeating what you have heard (LN is good)

2. You are a paid shill. 

I chose #2 because you do seem to have at least a beginner's technical understanding. "
"Ha ha ha, you're relentless. I wish someone would pay me! 

>It is absolutely not what we want 

Who is we? 
Surely, the majority of people who buy Bitcoin see more value in Bitcoin (hence the price being much higher than alts). 

Also... who are you, to think you know better than the core team?
Are you a coder? a computer scientist?

Even if LN does as you say ""replicate banks"" so what! If its only for basic stuff like buying coffee it really doesn't matter. 

If I wanted full fungibility and anonymity I would use Monero not Bitcoin anyway!

Have you sold all of your Bitcoin?
"
"""who are you, to think you know better than the core team? ""

"Sorry pal, you must be looking at different charts. 

Forking off with no decent devs isn't the smartest move if I'm honest.

"Again, if you focus your efforts toward entropic (negative) energy and worry about what your adversary is doing all the time, you will never feel at peace and your own work is going to suffer.  

We must come to understand that because of the success and hard work of core bitcoin itself succeeded which took that r/bitcoin community from 20,000 people when I first joined to somewhere near 300k today.  

However, the mod count hasn't gone up in line with that growth.  Many new people joining don't actually know much about the technology (bitcoin is just the new cool thing everyone is talking about) yet somehow feel they have an expert opinion that the people who built this should listen to.  

That's caused a problem because many of the people such as myself that would sit there patiently explaining things to new people are actually working on building new products for bitcoin.  I am not nearly as active there anymore and same is true of *most* bitcoin technology experts.  

So whilst it would be lovely to have discussion of good, bad, ugly and for there to be many clever people there able to answer questions and set people right, at the moment there literally isn't ENOUGH PEOPLE IN THE WORLD who actually understand all this well enough to be able to.  

Like literally you're working with some of the smartest computer scientists on the entire planet, and they've been managing reddit forums at the same time, but they can't keep doing that all the time *and* keep the technology evolving.

Hope that makes sense, thanks for reading :)"
"LMAO! All internet is 24 hours. In every country. Thank you for the LOL at the notion that some countries shut off internet at certain times lmao. 

It is so strange to me that LN supporters will not just admit that major downfall of LN. Everything has drawbacks and nothing is perfect. But you guys always try to come up with some excuse or deflection...

**But facts are facts...LN requires the sender, receiver and every channel/hub in between to be ONLINE.** 

LN does not innovate, IMO it goes back in time back to the dial up days where everyone had to be online and if you answered the phone the internet wouldn't work lmao. That is LN's idea of a peer to peer payment system. It is utterly hilarious that some bullshit corporation expects us to use that when we have cheap and feasible on chain transactions with Bitcoin Cash. 

Bitcoin Cash = cheap, fast, reliable payments to anywhere in the world with no middle man, no governing authority. Please explain to me how anyone would see LN, which requires you to be online to receive the payment, as a better system?

"
"If you were offline when they sent it, then yes, that is correct. There is discussion of an outgoing mailbox similiar to what was used in the 90's for emails, lmao:

https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/48755/in-lightning-network-what-are-the-proposals-for-solutions-to-transfers-to-offli

So you can see that LN is absolutely, hilariously pathetic in terms of usability.

Also, because of the way LN is setup, it can not be decentralized. Which makes sense, if you consider that no hub can relay a transaction that is greater in value than the value of the hub itself. In other words, you need to have atleast as much money as you're relaying, locked up. 

Because you are required to hold at least the amount of funds you are relaying, only large hubs can relay large payments. Large hubs are like banks. This produces centralization. Here is a mathematical proof:

https://medium.com/@jonaldfyookball/mathematical-proof-that-the-lightning-network-cannot-be-a-decentralized-bitcoin-scaling-solution-1b8147650800

So, LN is extremely centralized by default because of the requirement of holding funds to relay them and it is outdated and redundant because of the requirement that the receiver of a payment must be online to receive the payment. 

So the corporation that is spending millions of dollars to derail the decentralized peer to peer cash aspect of Bitcoin and desperately attempting to get people to instead use the extremely shitty, redundant and outdated LN, is in for an extremely rude awakening when people just refuse to use that garbage system and instead switch to a more practical method of transferring value. 

The investors that put money up to make such a system...I'm not sure what they'll say, but they will be pissed for sure, and they will probably feel dumb for thinking people will use this crap. Hindsight is 20/20. "
"Maybe if that's how /r/Bitcoin had been when it started, or if such a policy had been instituted for any reason other than to stifle opposition to those spinning a false narrative, it might have been acceptable.

But /r/Bitcoin had previously been an open forum where discussion of good, bad, and ugly was permitted. Restrictions on topics only came on hand when the moderation team decided to back Blockstream/core."
"I am not agreeing with the ban but I'm not a mod and have no clue about previous posts that lead to it.

So I think of it like this: 

People like to talk about bitcoin markets, r/bitcoin decided they wanted the sub to be more about bringing outsiders in and curating a positive and welcoming environment for people who want to share news and ideas on the tech.  So they asked those who wanted to talk about market and price if they could form their own group.

So r/bitcoinmarkets was born.  People don't come over from bitcoin markets into r/bitcoin telling the mods they're stupid for making that rule, they've found a nice home of their own where everyone shares an interest in markets.

BCH had a different vision for where bitcoin could go.  You have created a nice home called r/btc and your own currency and it's going brilliantly so far.  

I believe both camps can co-exist peacefully and share good people and ideas between one another to help strengthen the entire community.  And, more importantly by doing so present a professional, inclusive and welcoming image to new people coming in."

I do not actually give a single satoshi what the 'intention' of the original developers was.  They buggered off as soon as things got rough with Wikileaks wheras people like myself had to ask ""are you willing to go to jail for this?"" and we said yes and kept going holding on for dear life through all the fear and paranoia we all endured.

Well they can fork yes, and I support them in that endeavor.  But take over?  Nawwww."
"that block was rejected because it was 23 bytes bigger than 1MB, it had valid transactions and a valid PoW, according to section 5 of the bitcoin white paper it was valid. The fact that a cartel is enforcing a limit is another story. 
"
A hostage situation
You know as well as everybody else that the market dictates the price. The universe does not owe us a cheap blockchain but with sane block sizes and difficulties the market will grant us one.
So you're saying that if someone sends me bitcoin to my address via the LN and my computer is off, I will not receive it? Is that what you're saying? Because that doesn't sound right. 
Yeah, if we look at /r/Bitcoin like its /r/The_Donald, a place where fan boys can circle jerk, I think we'd all take it far less seriously.
"Yes valid PoW and valid transactions. And yes the bitcoin whitepaper didn't talk about block limits. Please do not make a cult out of bitcoin. (and with a cult I mean every religion) Since the original whitepaper we learned a lot of stuff.

Bitcoin is about consensus. Your block was rejected because of consensus rules you didn't follow.

That's really one point I don't get, everybody is giving everybody shit because of stupid stuff, but everybody could just change the rules. So change them! Stop that stupid ""it's all a conspiracy/AXA/whatever bullshit scheme"" and start talking about solutions that do not be batshit crazy (there was some flat earth theory here on /r/btc just recently).

Now there is bitcoin cash and that's good. But I like the really democratic approach in  Bitcoin and I want a sensible discussion. I see that there are a lot of problems over at /r/bitcoin but even more here. At least there is no censorship here, but people just don't know what they are talking about or are crazy about their opinions."
An argument only makes sense when you want to heard both sides.
"The ""market"" you're describing is miners externalizing the cost of block validation onto uncompensated nodes. You're reinventing Paypal and don't even realize it."
"Yes, it is utter fucking garbage. 

Yes, I know it is hard to believe that anyone would come up with such a shitty system and expect people to use it. IMO They are in for a rude awakening.

Likewise, another issue with such a system that a user brought up is that he can not add funds to cold wallets on LN. 

Sometimes users generate a pair of keys once on a safe offline machine, and use that for cold storage. Normally you can add funds to a cold wallet by simply sending a transaction to the public key. You do not need to be online or logged into anything to do this. You do not expose the keys this way, until it is time to spend.

With LN though, this doesn't work, because that is ""offline"" and won't receive the funds.

So needless to say the user was pretty upset that he won't be able to do that, I bet you he will just come to Bitcoin Cash. "
"Never been to r/The_Donald or particularly been bothered by what other communities are doing.

That would have been like me visiting the Visa or Western Union forum thinking that would somehow help the cause of bitcoin vs. just working with everyone in r/bitcoin to make it as awesome, collaborative and as harmonious as possible.  Basically just concentrating on all the positive things happening instead of focusing on what the 'bad' guys were doing."
"> Please do not make a cult out of bitcoin.

I am not, if you understand money there is no rational reason to limit transaction capacity, the cultists are those who say you can't remove the limit. 

>Since the original whitepaper we learned a lot of stuff.

not about economics, most developers are clueless as to how the quantity of money theory impacts the value and how limiting transaction capacity laterally guarantees centralization of the network with growth. 

>Bitcoin is about consensus. 

I role my eyes. it's about transferring value secured in a trustless  way by leveraging incentives. Consensus is not a goal or necessary it's a byproduct or a result of connecting to store value on the blockchain ledger.

"
I did. Thats how I ended up here
So if I generate a LN address and give it to someone... But I go offline for a week. I would not receive the Bitcoin they send to that address? 
You sound like you never heard the arguments of the other side. Both sides have good and bad arguments. Centralization is a problem. It's just not possible to do all everyday transactions on a blockchain.
Because 7 years is a really long time in tech. And you cannot foresee everything that is going to happen. Nobody at the time thought scaling will be an issue.
"Yeah I love all the crazy alts, has been fun watching mad ones like MoonCoin do well and who can forget Doge? Much Wow! Such Unexpected Success! :)

In terms of being wealthy, well I worked very very hard in the early days of the internet and was lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time to found a number of startups that did very well, so getting rich with bitcoin wasn't something that held any allure, was more about solving all the very big social problems I'd been fixated on since 2010 (I basically thought the world was gonna' come to an end if good people didn't do something, so threw myself into social activism and never really left).

Any money I made from bitcoin I either used to cover basic expenses, put in non-profits I liked, or help fund friends' dream projects like record albums and the like.  Hearing your friends album play on the radio and seeing their Mum cry at the launch and knowing you played a small part in it (and bitcoin funded it) is worth more than having a bunch of money in an exchange...

The bits I have left over I wanna' put into a new internet startup in this space, which is super exciting since I've been away from coding / designing for so long and have really missed building stuff in cyberspace.

I live a very modest lifestyle and try not to stay in one place too long, although there's a place in the UK that's always where I call home...  I think the world is so big and amazing that it's a travesty some people never really get to see much of it or are afraid of the unknown...  I'm most comfortable when I can just pack everything into a rucksack and travel with my laptop.  Have managed to see 60 or more countries living that way and loved every bit of it.  You realise everyone is the same and 99.9% of humans are just incredible and beautiful once you do away with all the nonsense that artificially separates us.

It's funny, we get all worked up about money and forget, you can basically live like a King in India and Asia on the tiniest of western incomes and live an amazing life but also realise that being a King isn't that big a deal.  Cliched as it may sound, I think this wealth thing is all about what you carry in your heart.

"Very inspiring story! I hope I can one day (in the not-too-distant future preferably ;) ) be in a position where I can use my engineering skills for ""the greater good"" somehow, rather than being a wage-slave for a greedy corporate with fairly boring technology. In the meantime, living expenses need to be covered however, though I do try to live frugally to maximize the delta between income and expenses. I don't have any desire to be super-wealthy, just want to not _have to_ work on something uninspiring just to survive, i.e. I want to be financially independent. It seems like an entirely achievable goal."

"There is also a huge difference in the demographics of the community. Bitcoin has always been speculated on but when merchants were accepting it as payment bitcoin was gaining organic growth from average users just checking out what this ""bitcoin"" thing is. It would gain steam on its own instead of due to shilling. For a while there when we leved off at around 300 or 400 for months I was actually happy with bitcoin because it was being used everyday as a currency. No backlog and quick. Nowadays it's just politics. I don't regret selling most of my stack when I did. I lost faith in bitcoin when this debate started and bitcoin no longer had any real utility."

Personally, I have never traded though.  Possibly 'cause of all the crap I've seen gambling does to people and also because one of the main reasons I got into bitcoin is because I saw it as a way to fix the problems speculation caused in Wall Street etc. -  HFT bots, warehouses full of rice rotting whilst kids starve (because traders speculate on food futures and so on).

So yeah, for me and many coders in this space, bitcoin isn't a get rich thing, it's a fix the world thing :)"

1. The purple rectangles highlight the areas where your pixel alignment is a little out of place.
2. I have underlined text on the right as not sure what anti-aliasing you have used?  The font is Ubuntu which you can grab from google fonts.
3. Not sure about the lime green and hard black on cash, has Jihan or others provided any branding guidelines similar to the original bitcointalk bitcoin brand discussion that was had back in the day?
4. You may wanna' lose WU altogether and, rather than creating a negative campaign picking on BTC, consider instead highlighting the two different use cases (store of value vs. fast micropayments).  You would then more likely get both BTC (who have largest share of voice at the moment) and BCH groups giving it more oxygen on social media.

"People started caring more about the price than fixing issues. Every upgrade proposal was seen as dangerous and scary because of the possibility of a legacy chain not dieing and the price being negatively impacted as a result. In the early days everyone was contacting merchants trying to get them to support bitcoin so people could actually use it as a payment network. The network worked flawlessly for years until it gained enough traction to require an upgrade. By this time bitcoin was worth ""a lot"" and thus this debate started. With one side wanting to upgrade bitcoin so it can be useful for something and the other side wanting it to be just a fake ""gold"" only used for speculation. Many of the websites that the original community convinced to accept bitcoin stopped using them as the backlog created such huge customer service problems. At the time bitcoin was being mainly used by noobs who just wanted to buy something quickly and saw that if they used bitcoin they would get a discount on their purchase. It's a shame the way it went. Bitcoin was so much better than PayPal for merchants as they didn't have to worry about chargebacks like you have with credit cards and PayPal. For the first time ever you could sell digital items such as ebooks, video games, software, video game items, and cd keys without the risk of getting charged back. I rarely see many online merchants accepting bitcoin anymore. I imagine the hassle is just too great."

>Bigger blocks -> less nodes -> more centralization

>Smaller blocks -> more nodes -> less centralization

You have made a statement that has no bearing on the issue of why we want the protocol to be decentralized.  The goal is to prevent bitcoin from being susceptible to a single point of failure or control. the goal is not more nodes. More nodes does not prevent a single point of  failure or control. 

the 1MB limit is a single point of failure risk, and BS/Core maintaining an official reference client where 90% of nodes all run the same implementation does not decentralize control, it's the epitome of centralized control. "

> Yeah that's the thing though. We aren't on the same side.

I think of BCH and BTC as I do RedHat and Debian - they are both trying different things with Linux and have different visions/ideas as to where it can go, and they both share good ideas and minds from the wider Linux community.  If they were fighting all the time then Linux itself would suffer as devs who are agnostic would be less likely to wanna' contribute, and as a result both RedHat and Debian would be weakened.   

As a developer about to finally start building stuff people really love using with all this I'm as excited about exploring BCH as I am LN.

> You guys censor and manipulate the narrative by deleting comments and quotes from Satoshi

I'm not ""you guys"", I'm not a mod over there and don't even use the downvote option on *anything* (though up-vote plenty).

Satoshi was the first to admit ""my word is not gospel"".  No-one's should be, and that's why 'Satoshi' recognised the importance of consensus.  Whilst I don't necessarily agree with deleting comments that don't fit the narrative, the very best way to influence that consensus is to take part in IRC meets, the dev mailing lists and submit your own [improvement proposals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bitcoin_Improvement_Proposals).  

For me the reddits aren't the best place for these things - they are for discussing and curating ideas and creating an approachable and welcoming environment for outsiders to embrace (in both camps).  

That's why r/bitcoin worked so well back in the days I did that original WU graphic - devs stuck to arguing about tech stuff behind the scenes whilst everyone on reddit got on with doing fun stuff that would help strengthen the community.

> Corporate L2 solutions

Like it or not we exist in a world run by corporations, which are really just a bunch of people working together toward a common purpose.  Some of those groups play nicer than others.  Bitpay / Bitmain / ViaBTC / Shapeshift are also corporations run by people with a vision.  Sticking the word 'corporation' in front of their ideas doesn't make those ideas evil.

As a techie, I am confident that Lightning is being run by a good bunch of people who are as excited as the rest of us about bitcoin and its tremendous capacity to change the way we measure and distribute economic energy.  I'm confident because it's been designed in such a way that they can't control the protocol level code any more than bitpay can.

The different visions from BCH and BTC are good.  It keeps everyone on our toes and ensures bad actors in this space never get to exert their authority over the wider aspirations of bitcoin - the idea.

Thanks for taking the time to read through all this :)"
"Yes and everybody agrees on that. Bigger blocks mean a bigger overall size of the Blockchain. Full nodes have to keep a copy of that blockchain. The bigger the Blockchain the less people will want to/be able to do this. A big number of independent nodes is required for Bitcoin to be decentralized.

Smaller blocks -> more nodes -> less centralization"

">  It's polarized the debate

Precisely. The size debate is ultimately mostly a distraction.

The real reason for the censorship has nothing to do with block sizes, and everything to do with maintaining control of Bitcoin in a few hands. The only reason they need to resort to those harmful tactics is because they don't believe in their own abilities, and therefore have to try to artificially slant community opinions to maintain their leadership.  

All the polarization generated is by design. Pick your tribe. Pick a side. You can be with the super-smart highly effective Bitcoin Core team, or you can be with the loosely organized rag tag group of malcontents that can't even agree on one single vision for Bitcoin.

Several Core members have gone on the record saying they would ""lose interest"" in contributing to Bitcoin is they stopped having such a dominant position. And yet that's exactly what needs to happen.  
Bitcoin Core needs to become one minority player amongst many others, and discussions around how Bitcoin can evolve need to become open again. If that means losing some Core developers to get there, it's a worthwhile sacrifice.

"Bitcoin used to cost pennies and confirm quickly. Now it costs dollars and confirms slowly. How does what's advertised not consist of ""worse than before""?"

"No this is not correct for several reasons:

1. Bitcoin Cash can scale to higher blocksizes

2. Core volume on Cash chain is only 1/8 of current capacity 

If Cash had **8x** the current number of Core transactions then fees would raise for Cash. But then Cash would just scale to a larger blocksize, and fees would remain low. "
Just wait for a few difficulty adjustments that are already scheduled to come up. It will self-correct soon-- something Bitcoin Core can't do.

"I think you're not looking at the bigger picture and how Bcash can actually be used as a tremendous support class under BTC.  

As a coder, I am going to strip away all the politics and look at what I've got to work with in the bright future ahead.  Right now we have two 'bitcoins' running near identical codebases  that in the future will be able to talk to each other via atomic swaps.  They both have significant investor and hashpower support and people involved have been in bitcoin since the beginning.  This is not an insignificant achievement.  

So in a years time when everything settles down, we actually have an even *stronger* bitcoin here that ethereum and other new kids on the block are going to find harder to disrupt (I also see ethereum working with LN at some juncture and all three cryptos doing amazing things together).

That makes things interesting because it allows for doing dual or triple blockchain redundancy checks on super sensitive things (such as the sale of a house).  Now when people feel safe their data can never be lost with one blockchain going down and you capture even 1% of the real estate and property market, guess what begins to happen?

At the moment all this mud throwing nonsense is highly unproductive, but whatever happens on the social network sides of this, at the end of the day it will be the code and the products built with this technology that people actually want to use that does the *real* talking.  

In that sense, just as people have no clue (or interest) in what the VISA network does behind the scenes (or intra company politics) as long as their debit card works, similarly, people will have very little interest in how Bcash / BTC / Ethereum works as long as they can rely on the LN app that enables them to secure their house sale across all three networks.

Exciting times :)

"> you weren't hostile to bch

Bcash is no more derogatory or threatening to BTC than monero or dash.  It's a group that have a different vision for bitcoin.  If we agree that hostility and dirty politics is something we don't want then we shouldn't engage in it ourselves, even if we have a different philosophy.  So I choose not to be hostile to either group and instead encourage the good people in both to stick to facts and positive, proactive action.  

We didn't make all this progress against WU and incumbents (who are now believing in this technology) by being hostile to them.  My original image wasn't hostile to WU; it merely stated facts.  Similarly, bitcoin wouldn't have gotten to where it got to had we focused any of our energy on the nonsense coming out of r/buttcoin.

If you truly want to help BTC then focus your energy on keeping that group as positive and upbeat as possible and accept that open source projects get forked and it doesn't matter what you or I would have preferred to happen because no-one has ultimate authority over the destiny of open source code.

Best we can all do is lay down arms, support and help guide good people who share our vision, and just get on with actually doing the work that will help that vision become reality.

In the end, the future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams, not those who fight against others who don't.

Hey /u/bashco, any comment?
"I would point out that the original goal of bitcoin was to create a self-contained ecosystem where people could just spend bitcoin for the things they wanted. This would eliminate the need to have to pay exchange fees on both sides of a transaction.

"To be fair if you pay the $5 fee your bitcoin transaction will be confirmed in a timely manner. It's misleading to state that fees are high *and* confirmations are erratic - you can only pick one of these.

BCC is a bit more complicated - although the fees are lower it looks like we're in for another sparse-blocks phase where transactions could take hours to confirm :/

Yes, it's certainly a lot more slick looking than the original idea I built upon [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2mwnjk/western_union_vs_bitcoin/) (which was done in Paint I believe) :)

Still, even my first attempt at a re-work needed tweaks before the community deemed it professional enough to go out.  I would say the same of this first BCash attempt *if* you *really* want to help BCash succeed and present it in a professional light.  Which is a must if you want investors and companies to take BCH as seriously as they took the original bitcoin ad (since we worked very hard to get everything looking perfect).

With that in mind, [here's a small photoshop / branding critique](https://imgur.com/a/y3Wvp) 

1. The purple rectangles highlight the areas where your pixel alignment is a little out of place.
2. I have underlined text on the right as not sure what anti-aliasing you have used?  The font is Ubuntu which you can grab from google fonts.
3. Not sure about the lime green and hard black on cash, has Jihan or others provided any branding guidelines similar to the original bitcointalk bitcoin brand discussion that was had back in the day?
4. You may wanna' lose WU altogether and, rather than creating a negative campaign picking on BTC, consider instead highlighting the two different use cases (store of value vs. fast micropayments).  You would then more likely get both BTC (who have largest share of voice at the moment) and BCH groups giving it more oxygen on social media.

Fun fact: software patents are only a thing in the US.
"> Many things are patentable, including a method of swinging sideways on a swing.

That's because the US Patent Office isn't functioning as intended.  Instead of thoroughly examining patents before granting them, they take applications in order to collect the application fees, and then let people fight over them in court later.  

If a third party goes to the trouble of showing prior art *before* the patent is granted, they may disallow it, but the default is to go ahead and grant it.  This is how we get stupid patents like [Method of Exercising a Cat](https://www.google.com/patents/US5443036) (with a laser-pointer)."

"You are making things up again Arnold.  

> Rather than accept that the majority of technical people in bitcoin agree with SegWit

Prove it, but you won't, because you cannot do anything beyond linking and spouting things you do not know.

But you got one thing right, Blockstream is bad.  Not because I am spiteful or whatever thing you claim.  Look if there had not been so much FUD, schmearing, and dishonesty surrounding things, if they had just doubled the blocksize way back when, if they had not driven off all of the technical genius that once made Bitcoin innovative, maybe I would not feel that way, but they did and they have the least intelligent, least technical group of people out shilling for them."
Isn't SegWit *required* to make Lightning possible? 
"Your post is pure comedy.  You've shown nothing but your own bias, anything Blockstream is aligned with is therefore bad right?  You probably didn't even read the link I posted?

> If anyone (including us) was considering it, it would already be too late because the public disclosure of SegWit was more than a year ago

> Blockstream does not have a commercial intent behind our support of SegWit.

People like you would rather bite your own nose off to spite your face.  Rather than accept that the majority of technical people in bitcoin agree with SegWit, you're trying to dig out some shred of dirt you can find to make Blockstream the bad guys.

And you know what, I _do_ have issues with the whole Core/Blockstream relationship, but you're too busy screaming at people for being shills, and putting anyone that disagrees with you into RES as a troll I'm sure?

You want evidence of Blockstream being the bad guys, _find some evidence_. I'm not doing it because I think you're a deluded fool."

"""Because Blockstream doesn't have patents on Segwit.""

That we know of.  As has been said, patents can be kept secret for 18 months after filing, and we certainly don't know when such a patent might have been filed."
"Thanks for the reply.  Some people are saying that https://patents.google.com/patent/US20160330034A1/en is a patent on sidechains.  It may not be a patent on Segwit, but if there is a patent on sidechains and sidechains become a crucial part of the functioning of bitcoin (through Segwit), that would be a grave concern.

I think the general issue is that no one wants to risk making any patent controlled by any one company a crucial part of bitcoin.  

Is there a reason why that fear isn't justified? (It's a little different than what the OP was claiming, but still would be a serious concern.)"
"Agreed. That is why I was so shocked to see this sub (and BU devs!) embrace **nChain** so warmly. This is a company that claimed to have ""hundreds of Bitcoin-related patents"" which they plan to ""use *offensively*.""

Hell, the BU Dev Team even *officially partnered* with the motherfuckers!

It's sickening."
ok, but there still is no technical connection between sidechains and segwit
Nor is it a sidechain.
"I love Rick Falkvinge (awesome guy) and Bitcoin Cash, but using his article out of context without disclaiming in the OP that there are no _known_ patents, looks bad on us, rightfully so. Rick was clear it was his _belief/hunch_, and the emails never mention segwit patents specifically; only legal action for intent to destroy people's property, which could mean anything. If you scroll down to the comments of the [Rick Falkvinge article](https://falkvinge.net/2017/05/01/blockstream-patents-segwit-makes-pieces-fall-place/), you will see Greg Maxwell (Blockstream CTO) deny any patents. This type of post should get downvoted."
">Blockstream can't use them to attack anyone for using SegWit. Not now or in the future.

You mean... Trust these fuckers to have no other patents hidden under another name? LOL!

>Patents you list have no relevance to discussion here.

"> I base this not on having read the actual patents, for they can be kept secret for quite some time; I base this on observing Blockstream’s behavior

I don't know how much Falkvinge understands the US Patent system, but my understanding is that patent *applications* can be kept private for [18 months](https://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/s1120.html), after which they are published.  *Granted* patents are public.  The point of patents is public disclosure of inventions in exchange for a limited time right to exclude others from using it.  If you want to keep something secret, that's known as a ""trade secret"".  The formula for Coca-Cola is probably the most famous one.  Trade secrets don't expire, but you can't prevent someone from using it if they discover it independently. "
But moderation and censorship are the same thing.
Can you explain how is that related to bitcoin?
"> 'Satoshi' was the first to say ""my word is not gospel"". 

Does not have to be gospel, it just has to show that the defintion of bitcoin is not in the hands of Theymos and BScore.  BScore has to prove that they own the name bitcoin and what that means, which they will not be able to do in a court of law, so long as the white paper shows how the miners were to be the arbiters.  Bitcoin.org and /r/bitcoin do not get to sue for the name bitcoin, and they are NOT own the official website.

Bitcoin only works long term if people can agree what bitcoin is, but Theymos and BScore has made that impossible.  They need to be ejected from the ecosystem.  They are cancer for bitcoin and crypto as a whole."
"Sidechains and segwit are completely unrelated. You do not need segwit in any way to make a sidechain. Our commercial offering, Liquid, hasn't even been updated yet to use segwit.

As to the issue of patents in general, a lot of that is covered by our patent FAQ:

https://blockstream.com/about/patent_faq/"
"What more can you do?  You really really are an idiot. 

They say ""we're not doing this thing"" and there is zero fucking evidence to the contrary. And dumb fucking idiots _still_ don't believe it. If they _were_ patenting segwit then it would be obvious, and easily challenged. 

Get some _fucking evidence_ to prove your claims, there is nothing else that can be done to settle this argument. 

Sick of you crazy people trying to shift the burden of proof for your batshit insane conspiracies all the time. "
"Well, he's right about one thing.  It *is* intent to upgrade the legacy chain.  And that intent didn't just come from the signers of the NY agreement.  It came from Satoshi.

And the alternative, which they demand, is to make both chains less secure. 
 I am simply unsurprised, at this point, that these BS/Core supporters are really sticking with their idiotic argument that, somehow, degrading Bitcoin security is the only acceptable upgrade path.  That really reveals a lot about their true character and motives."
The MIT license actually doesn't grant patent licenses, unfortunately. But in this case, there are no patents anyway, so it's still FUD.
surely its implied by releasing your patent work with a license that permits any kind of use that you are licencing any patents relied on in that work under the same terms?
"> the defintion of bitcoin is not in the hands of Theymos and BScore.

You hit the nail on the head.  

The definition of bitcoin is whatever this magnificent transformative technology evolves into as a result of the myriad optimisations and improvements made by the 200+ core contributors and the ecosystem participants; not an aging whitepaper that hadn't even conceptualised what Sidechains might be capable of, or ICO's or myriad alts, or ethereum or the machine-payable web.

'Satoshi' were also aware of this and conscious they hadn't even begun to scratch the surface of where this might eventually go.
"
"I asked you for something fairly simple and instead of trying, you just get all angry and name calling.  Yes, you really showed me that you are confident in what is going down.

"The core issue is that according to the Satoshi white paper, the miners get to decide what changes go into bitcoin.  Thus the vote on S2X IS bitcoin by the definition of the white paper.  BScore has no legal standing to sue the ecosystem because they refuse to compromise or work with the miners.  

Also, the bitcoin source code is open source, and if you put your patented ideas into it and release it, those ideas also become open source.  To claim that the source code is owned by BScore because there is some patented features is nonsense.  The best they can do is claim that their special off chain implementations are patented.

BScore/Theymos has turned this whole ecosystem into a fucking nightmare, all because they want their way no matter what.  What should have been a simple 2mb compromise followed by a soft fork decrease back to 1mb when LN and side chains could pick up the slack would have keep the community together and on the same page.  The issue is so fucking stupid, its infuriating.

The best hope now is that those companies supporting S2X stick to their guns and force BScore to either compromise or be ejected from the ecosystem."
I think SW will have a huge difficulty in a court since that is not bitcoin, from software engineering point of view, and from whitepaper point of view and from security point of view
"BScore has no legal legs to stand on.  The Satoshi paper said that the miners get to approve and decide what constitutes bitcoin.  All the S2X supports have to do is show that the miners are voting S2X and the Satoshi white paper.  There's no reason to assume that the ""official website"" (e.g. bitcoin.org) has any legal rights or claims on the name ""bitcoin"" and SegWit without 2x.

That being said, it is also important for wallet creators to warn users of this fact so that people can make up their own minds."
"The link you posted from Blockstream.  How is that lost on you?

""Your Honor, you can see that I am innocent, as right here, I stated, I did not bludgeon that homeless man to death.  So charges dismissed eh?""

What we really need to figure out, is what novel idea does Segwit bring to the table, under which it could be patented?  I do not think it has any, but the Patent Office did once allow a patent for one-click purchasing, so why don't you shoot and tell me what novel benefit Segwit was bringing to the table and then I will go look and see if there are any patents for it."
"I don't share your frustrations and fought for the right for BCH to do what they did when we had the last wave of bitcoiners panicking.

> The core issue is that according to the Satoshi white paper, the miners get to decide what changes go into bitcoin. 

'Satoshi' were just a group of humans as fallible and uncertain about where all this was going as everyone else.  'Satoshi' disappeared when the whole Wikileaks thing happened and so is no longer an entity that can be consulted on these matters.  'Satoshi' also recognised the importance of group consensus and the autonomy of individuals within the group to best decide bitcoin's future.  'Satoshi' was the first to say ""my word is not gospel"". 

This, like all the other panics over the BCH fork will be ancient history in a few months."
Even if they do have a patent on SegWit, they released it to the public under the MIT license.  Anyone can now copy and use it however they like.
"> The link you posted from Blockstream. How is that lost on you?

So your argument is that blockstream put out a statement, who else was going to do it? If they said nothing people would assume it's true, if the put out a statement saying it's untrue, you clowns dnot believe it.  Damned if you do, damned if you don't. 

Your comedy response of 

> ""Your Honor, you can see that I am innocent, as right here, I stated, I did not bludgeon that homeless man to death. So charges dismissed eh?""

"The patent office is pretty much a rubber stamp.  If you want to invalidate a patent, you have to show prior art.  That means, you have to 1) know the patent exists, 2) know the prior art exists, and 3) to have *retained a copy* of the prior art before *someone* (cough) has had a chance to censor it into oblivion.

That's assuming everyone plays fair.  Unfortunately, some people don't.  And, let me tell you, these people involved in developing Bitcoin, at a high level, are engaged in some *very* shady tactics regarding intellectual property.  Anyone interested in maintaining Bitcoins openness needs to [stay on their toes](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6tulqx/think_that_blockstream_satellite_is_a_new/dloscu0/)."

Not really. He is referring to as statement by Eric Lombrozo. If Eric goes out officially like that, it has some weight to it. But I have no idea what he really can do. If anything, it is Eric that is spreading FUD."
"No one, not even someone as stupid as yourself, is damning them for putting out a statement.  

If you would kindly read, try to comprehend, and get it through your thick, empty skull, the issue is not that they made a statement, the issue is that you have no proof of what they have or have not done other than that statement.  

I am not asking you to prove they did not Patent shit, I simply asked you to tell me what was unique, worthy, worthwhile about Segwit so that I might go look for a patent on that feature, and you double down on nothing, emptiness, like the vacuum between your ears.  Further, I have not claimed that they did patent it, I have just pointed out that they are the kind of filthy scum that would.  That they have contributed nothing, good, to Bitcoin and that anyone who has been paying attention has good reason to be skeptical.  I do not have to prove any of that to a segwit shill like yourself.

Then when I further point this out, you make up more garbage and argue against it, when you are the only person imagining that conversation.

So please, respond with another argument about claims I have not made.  Go on.  Just reading your comment history, underscores your very thin understanding of Bitcoin and what the goals are.  Being a Blockstream dick warmer does nothing to move Bitcoin towards its goals."
"If they put SegWit into open source software, it becomes open source and anyone can use it.  

Another issue is that Satoshi indicated that changes to bitcoin are decided by the miners, so they have no legal footing to say that S2X is not bitcoin.  There is no need to put in replay protection from a legal standpoint.  It is CoreCoin that will have to defend itself from replay protection if they don't agree with what the miners have decided.

Another issue is how some of the developers have attacked other coins.  If they want to decry destroying ""property"" as a litigious issue, then they are clearly guilty of destroying other coins."
