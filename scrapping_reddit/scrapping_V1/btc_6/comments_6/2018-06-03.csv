"So you don't see a slight problem with the idea of relying on an expansive deficit economy with a shrinking population?

Here let me make it simple for you. Suppose you want to buy a bunch of stuff but you don't have the money to do it. You're in a lucrative business and your salary has gone up every year for as long as you care to remember. So you take on debt which you currently could not service, but you expect that will be no problem in a few years when your salary has gone up. So you spend all the money you went into debt for to buy yourself nice things. But then comes the end of the year, and instead of getting a raise, your salary is cut. Same thing happens next year, and the year after that, and so on. If the thought ""oh shit"" has crossed your mind, you're on the right track."
Dude you sound like a fucking tin foil hat conspiracy theorist. I made a joke that is completely unrelated and you’re replying with with all this hokey pokey bullshit about several different topics that doesn’t even make sense. Quit pulling facts out of your ass man. 
"Nope. Not at all what I was saying. Nor is that the logic I was using. But this topic is a matter of perspective which is obvious we disagree on. At first there was a single bitcoin. Since that single point beginning there have been and will most likely continue to be forks of the bitcoin project. As such each fork should have its own name to avoid confusion. The value of the forks is not really relevant. But it should be easy to distinguish which fork we are talking about from one another. I do not think you disagree with that. I am not at all advocating that the BTC chain have to change it's name every time a new fork is made. I did not imply that. Once again it seems to me that your measure of what makes bitcoin and my measure of what makes bitcoin are different things. It seems pretty clear to me that you think there is only 1 true real legit official bitcoin and that every thing else is a clone or copy. We will not be able to agree on what is and what is not bitcoin. That is ok. Once again I am not advocating at all to rename it to Bitcoin Core or Bcore or anything along those lines. I think I have been pretty clear about that. I was asking you for a neutral naming convention which you think is unnecessary. To clarify I completely understand that the coin is different from the network and from the implementation.  I am aware that the CORE implementation is indeed different than the Knots implementation. I am aware that Bitcoin Classic and Unlimited XT etc are all different things too.  I am also aware that there are many forks of bitcoin including gold, private, cash, pizza, classhic etc. Though I have to admit I have not looked deeply into any version of bitcoin beyond the BTC and BCH versions so I can not comment on the strengths or weaknesses or validity of them. I could go on listing the things I am aware of but it is a waste of time.   To summarize I think the BTC chain should have a unique name to help differentiate it from the other types of bitcoins that is not offensive or ""misleading"" (Core, Bcore). You think ""Bitcoin"" by itself is fine and offered no suggestion.  I disagree. The end. "
I think we are making progress, lets continue. Tell me why you think Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash arent unique names. When I read them on my phone the first name has seven letters contained in one word, and the second name has 11 letters contained in two words. They look unique too me, just like Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Clashic names look unique, they have different and/or extra letters and everything.
So as long as the fork markets itself as the original then the original also has to change its name? So Bitcoin becomes Bitcoin Core, then gold forks off and now says it's the real Bitcoin Core, so therefore Bitcoin Core now needs to change its name again?
But the same argument could be used at any point when a fork occurs. If Bitcoin Clashic said both it self and the original Bitcoin Cash was Bitcoin Cash, and to fix the problem and to stop confusion the original Bitcoin Cash had to change its name. It would now have to call itself, for example, Bitcoin Cash Original.
"We are going in circles. We disagree on what ""bitcoin"" is. I think it encompasses all forks. You think it is only one official chain. This is starting to feel like sealioning."
Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash are also unique names in themselves.
No. All bitcoin forks should have a unique name in my opinion. No there is no need for anyone to change their names because as you can see Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Clashic are unique names by themselves. 
"That is not at all what I am saying. To reduce some of the confusion I will just use tickers, bear with me. If BTG suddenly said to the world. ""Hey guys were are no longer using BTG we are using BTC"". They are free to do so. But I doubt anyone would go along with it which is irrelevant if they so decided to do so. In your odd scenario above you are ignoring my main point which is that both BTC and BCH and maybe even BTG  (don't know the details of the fork well and there may have been shenanigans) are all bitcoin. In my opinion ""the original"" no longer exists. The original was 1. Now it is many. "
Well Bitcoin ABC is a fork of Bitcoin Core, i.e. a copy. If you dont believe me just have a look at the code.
"I do not think we are making progress. Because we disagree that both BTC and BCH are bitcoin.  So if I say ""I will send you some bitcoin"" it is not entirely obvious without context as to what version of bitcoin I am talking about. "
Also BTC is the ticker symbol for bitcoin (the token) and is not analogous to Bitcoin (the network). So when talking about Bitcoin then BTC does not make sense. The token and the network are two different things which I'm not sure you understand the difference. See how important language is and all the meaning it can convey if used properly (honestly not trying to be condescending)
"So Bitcoin should only change its name when forked by Bitcoin Cash? What gives Bitcoin Cash this special privilege over other forks, like Bitcoin Gold?

Also funny you should mention Bitcoin Clashic, which is a fork of Bitcoin Cash. Should Bitcoin Cash now change its name to differentiate itself for Bitcoin Clashic, as being a fork from the original Bitcoin Cash?

The ongoing discussion."
"We do not agree that the name ""bitcoin"" is fine for one version of a multiple version project. The problem isn't what I think is better as I dont have a problem with it being called core personally. I personally think Bitcoin SLN is more inclusive of its added technologies. But once again you disagree. You can not suggest a better name for the BTC fork so I will just use BTC as there seems to be consensus that it is not an inappropriate abbreviation. if YOU can think of a better name let me know."
It wasn't coherent as it lacked purpose. It was just a few standard bitcoin cash argument lines which had nothing to do with what I was saying. So therefore explaining what you said wouldn't help. You would need to begin actually addressing the issues I raised :)
"Just because something is in your opinion ""the standard"" does not make it untrue. That being said I agree all these naming issues are confusing especially to the uninitiated. The parties in control of all handles/subs will never agree to change so it is a non starter. As to your point about Bitcoin Core being a poor choice for a distinction I also agree it is not the best choice. So lets work together to get everyone from now on to use Bitcoin SLN (segwit lightning) when needing to distinguish it from other forks.  "
"
So you are saying that every time someone forks Bitcoin it needs to change its name? Bitcoin has been forked many times. Bitcoin Cash is not the only one. Under your logic when Bitcoin Cash forked Bitcoin would first become Bitcoin Core, then Bitcoin Core Gold forks, we rename Bitcoin Core to Bitcoin Core Classic, then when Bitcoin Core Classic Private forks, we rename Bitcoin Core Classic to Bitcoin Core Classic Legacy...

As an example of how other multi version projects do naming, in open source software, the version that forks off takes a new name to differentiate itself from the original. For clarity this makes perfect sense. Open source software projects seem to handle this problem pretty well.

And even if you are going to rename the original, dont add to the confusion even more by giving it the name of a software implementation of the network. To me that shows either ignorance or insidious intent."
Fair enough. However if in the future the vast majority of TXs happen on LN would it not then be fair to say that it is the dominant feature and therefore appropriate? When I say Nintendo games you immediately think Super Mario etc when they were producing other kinds of games for about 100 years before.  If the Core team roadmap goes as they plan will not most TXs be on LN?
Depends on lots of things, 1. Other efficiency protocols are on there way for Bitcoin which means more tx per block, 2. Block size increase can still occur with the correct planning, 3. LN software can still make tx without LN. With smart contracts a lot of 2nd layer solutions can be built a top of Bitcoin, not just LN, e.g. have a look at RSK. Calling Bitcoin LN is not thinking broad enough.
Segwit is only one of many technologies/protocols in Bitcoin. The lightning network is also not Bitcoin, but an implementation of its smart contract features. A bit like calling all cars taxis because they can be used like that, or cruise control as that's one of their features.
What is your purpose in trying to rename Bitcoin?
*sigh* This as I said before ties directly to my points above. Bitcoin is no longer one thing, but a group of things. It has forked and as such there exists several versions of something where there was but one before.  I assume you will never agree that there is more than one version of bitcoin and you will also not agree on a unique name for the BTC fork of bitcoin perhaps other than BTC. I try to be diplomatic and not refer to things by names people consider inappropriate. But im not seeing a lot of suggestions here. I will just continue to use BTC then.
Bitcoin name works fine, let me know when you come up with something better, however bitcoin core is terrible.
"Alright. Well seeing as you dislike Bitcoin Core as a name. What do you suggest as a unique name for the BTC fork? Don't try to be sneaky and say ""Just bitcoin"". We are trying to find a diplomatic name for the ""core team"" chain. "

Bitcoin as cash is the only bitcoin that can have long term success. Without it mining reward runs out and network stops being secure. 
"Don't lie, you love it.

Sorry to hear that.  Maybe you can relaunch with BCH at some point in the future.  The author of [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Aint-Nobodys-Business-You-Consensual/dp/192976717X) was murdered by the USA federal government, but it really made me view the sex industry differently than before. 
"All Bitcoin investors August 1, 2017,  started with equal amounts of BTC and BCH.

I think it may be only a small minority who have sold their BCH. 

Anyway, they can reinvest. In the long run, it is not sustainable to actively talk it down to justify selling."

Exactly. If they accept cash for it, they'd likely accept Crypto too. It's a simple register transaction.

"Huh? The fact that they take many non-crypto payment methods doesn't at all detract from how ~~huge~~**gigantic** this is, if true. 

""Only"" 7-11, Family Mart, and Lawson? I can't think of any other major chains. I can literally sling a stone to 4 of these from where I am standing (3 Family Marts and a Lawson, further in the distance I see another two Family Marts and a 7-11). This is bleatin' incredible news, and it's much bigger than the equivalent in the US because convenience stores are pervasive, let you pay for almost anything and are a deeply rooted part of people's everyday lives.  

That said, I don't think almost anyone will pay with BCH, since most don't have it anyway and most Japanese don't see crypto as cash even if they hold BCH. You can tell most aren't holding it to use as cash by the fact that it moves in synch with the rest of the market. Unsophisticated investors still rule. "

about to spend a month and a half in Tokyo, will confirm if this is true or not and post back here.
Holy crap. That is AWESOME!

This is going to get the snowball rolling.
Konbini is a way of life in Japan. This is huge.
Can someone summarize? I hate watching videos
"Fantastic news!

Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin"
And the BTC boys can’t be angry because they don’t even want BTC to be used for payments. “Muh store of value!”

Wait... what? Is there any detailed info on this anywhere? Would really like to read up more about it.
Yep, freaking awesome. Definitely on the right path to cash for the entire world. Love it!
Which chain? 7/11, Family Mart, Lawsons, etc?
Important thing about this: you can pay for anything at convenience stores in Japan. I bought items off Amazon at convenience stores in cash. I paid all my bills. I paid for everything at convenience stores. If this pans out, you can then almost buy everything with BCH in Japan .
That's a great news for community
"You're welcome. Did you ever hear the Shop 99 song? 

Shop the Q, QQ QQQ. Shop the Q, QQ QQQ."
I ratify this.
because fomo
You can only pay bills in cash at the convenience store. Not sure about the rest, never done it.
You can buy items from Amazon with cash anonymously. You only need a \(temporary\) email, no credit info, no address. It will be great if BCH has anonymous transactions one day.
Block?
">Huge news if this is real.

As someone living in Japan... not really. It's cool, but in the last few years they've gone from being basically cash only to taking everything and the kitchen sink.

>You can pay all bills at any convenience store in Japan

Not any - likely only 711, Family Mart and Lawson are going to accept it. That's 50,000 locations, but not all."
big if true
Hopefully Lawsons first... got a ton around me.
Yeah, I'm gonna need a better source than some sort of hype vid
Fuk Japan they outlawed monero. Boycott them
None - this video is still the only source
Lol why tho? It’s useless 
Oh my god that fucking song. Now I'm going to have to go listen to some white noise to get that earworm out.
BCH PLS :D
"Standing on the shoulders of your comment to shout how big this is.

Convenience stores in Japan are truly convenient - they provide access to so many services through partnerships with other companies. Not to mention their direct business of food, drinks, etc.

I haven’t seen the details but each of the big convenience stores has national reach and some of them have regional reach.

Roger is working at the right level here. Great."
"Yes

If one does it, the others will too. "
