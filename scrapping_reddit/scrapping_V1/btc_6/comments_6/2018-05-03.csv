there was no censorship going on, I have no idea wher eyou got such an asinine idea.

Yes it sure does! Check out the site, they have coinbase next to Stripe :)
Does this work like any other Woocommerce payment gateway?  I can have it side by side along with other options like Credit Card/Paypal in the normal cart flow?
looks good!  is that new?
Agreed. Bitcoin Cash is far better in terms of being progressive technologically. But it's the image that the Bitcoin Cash community presents that is so toxic. Roger Ver is a poor representative for the project, and the attempt to hijack the Bitcoin name is counterproductive. If Bitcoin cash is so great, then allow the people to come. But don't try to use confusion tactics to get people to adopt it. It's the wrong way to go. 
Some people choose only to state their opinion on things they have some knowledge about.
But they've gone beyond the generic turd symbol by specifically pointing out Bitcoin.com and @Bitcoin twitter handle as scammy. Which is stupid because Roger owned Bitcoin.com well before the war commenced while he promoted BTC. And whoever now owns @Bitcoin presumably bought it in an open market process and has every right to express his opinions. 
Bitcoin gold is not too bad. I loved the free money it got me when I sold it. 
because it's not a threat to btc holder's investments
here's a downvote to hold your honor higher. 
"Shitcoins are generally useless alts with low hashrate security, small market caps, and almost always an element of pre-mining or questional coin distribution.

This is the first time I've seen 'shitcoin' used in this context though  (of intentionally misleading people by holding ownership of websites/Twitter accounts)

Ps: at least while downvoted to help you can still participate in discussion. I've been banned from the other sub for about 10 months now because I supported the idea of following through on the nya/sw2x signalling"
It sounds like this guy doesn’t like crypto in general, just the drama and the trolling
responding to your edit, you're fucking dumb. Lmao.
"So the interesting thing here is that he's not wrong when he says, ""Just because many people want something doesn't make it right.""  This is evident throughout history.

"That’s why he said low IQ. The very definition of a fork is to co-opt the original name when a large portion of the community is not happy with the existing dev team & what they’re doing. 

The market decides who wins.

The entire argument that “BCH is naughty because it’s trying to co-opt the name”, indicates they don’t have any idea how the basics of crypto work. "

"Both of those sites (livecoinwatch and coinlib.io) require email registration to set up a portfolio. What I liked about coincall.io was no registration necessary. This thread is probably doubling their page-hits. ;)

Yeah. I just dont like seeing people let shit like this bother them. There are so many sites that have the same function as this one. Not worth the post.

"**Blind men and an elephant**

The parable of the blind men and an elephant originated in the ancient Indian subcontinent, from where it has been widely diffused. It is a story of a group of blind men, who have never come across an elephant before and who learn and conceptualize what the elephant is like by touching it. Each blind man feels a different part of the elephant body, but only one part, such as the side or the tusk. They then describe the elephant based on their partial experience and their descriptions are in complete disagreement on what an elephant is.

You are the outliers, it makes no sense to not admit it. You should embrace it.
notice how every troll has the expanded, uncollapsible comments? it gives them away 99% of the time
"They use LocalStorage (key: 'coinfolio') where the site stores json-serialized data about your portfolio in you browser (this does not exclude the possibility of cookies being used to track you or the data being sent to the server).

You can check it yourself with any modern browsers debugging features (Chrome: View -> Developer -> Developer Tools -> Application -> LocalStorage  -> find the key 'coinfolio')."
Yes, I believe they use cookies. They have a very easy method of portfolio entry. That's why I liked them. As for privacy, here's a simple trick: You don't have to enter your true holdings. You can enter a convenient multiple. Then, just scale it mentally.
"> livecoinwatch.com

Nice site, but requires registration for portfolio watching, though."
"I would consider it equally childish.

But it's their site (which I've never heard of, and now have - with a negative first impression). Genius marketing."
But they didn't so we don't have to opine on that 
"The criteria are purely based on how salty some people are about the coin.

Especially since the ratio of btc-bch went from 10% to 15% in a week or two, a lot of people got salty. 

I will never understand people rather shitting on the success of others."
"Bitcoin gold inserted code where a certain percentage of the mining rewards went to the creator's own address without any announcement or information that change was happening.

Even if it's converted to a dev fund later, the lead dev clearly tried to decieve users.

Bitcoin gold should clearly be labeled a shitcoin."
It's because you're stupid, that's why anyone who reads your words would think it's easy to get under your skin.
"That's a pretty shitty view to take.

Bch has good fundamentals (value, distribution, hashrate, txps, etc) and one of the more active communities.

The fact is that bitcoin split into two conceptually different chains because developers (of the bitcoin core client) and a subset of users+services+miners decided to act counter to the NYA and the supermajority of support for sw2x.

One chain refused to scale via blocksize, and the other chose to scale primarily via that method. We could argue semantics all day about what's bitcoin and the pros/cons of each - but that's not my point. "
"Lol... Noob thinks he can decide which crypto currency is legit. You know what's not legit? Gmax freak show trying to control a protocol that is left to be settled by hashpower consensus.

You're here because you're afraid of Bitcoin (BCH) rising to 0.3 and beyond. Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin. You have to admit this whether you are a BCH fan or not.
You oldies are going to get run over by Ethereum.

"> So people should get their way if they outnumber the thinkers regardless of merit? That's your Justice warrior logic? Decentralization is not democracy.

No, that is not what I'm saying.

I'm saying that you should find your place, your movement and your meaning.
Attempting to ""be"" Bitcoin is not going to succeed. And it's making a lot of people angry at you, which is most likely contra-productive.

Basically, your slogan should be ""Bitcoin cash is _not_ Bitcoin"", because ""Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin"" has already angered a lot of people, and you'll just continue to disenfranchise yourself with the greater crypto community and economy.  
Do you understand what the OP is about?

"> Attempting to ""be"" Bitcoin is not going to succeed. And it's making a lot of people angry at you

This is why I asked you if you had any idea how forks work in a free market.  Because again, your comment indicates you don't.  

This isn't something we're just ""choosing to do"".  Its a fork.  The entire purpose of a fork is to redirect the original project down another path, when the existing path is not agreeable to a large % of people.  

So ""taking the name"" is a default premise.  Its not a choice.  And nobody cares if ""its making people angry"".   *It made us angry that Blockstream came in and crippled Bitcoin so they could profit off its transaction volumes.   That's why we forked.  And on a moral level Im pretty fucking solid in the assessment that this was a corrupt, inappropriate thing for them to do.*

But this isn't some random alt coin trying to copycat.   ***This is Bitcoin, going another direction***.   Will it get the name eventually?   The market will decide.  Not you.  Not me.  Not Roger.   And there won't be a damn thing any of us can do about it.  

That's reality.  Deal with it.  And correct your phrasing.  Because you look uneducated."
"there's a fine line between being a vitriolic troll on social media to try to affect price, and buying asic hardware to strengthen the network.

miners earn the right to ""vote"" because there is a cost to become a miner. 

UASF comes to mind. If it was actual hash rate and not twitter polls, then UASF would have been a valid means of consensus. Instead we had social media manipulation, DDoS attacks, astroturfing, rigged futures markets, etc.  "

"I agree that we should stop saying that BCH is the real Bitcoin. I think the name Bitcoin Cash is strong enough to stand on its own, especially as the better utility becomes apparent to more and more people in the future. But I understand why Roger is saying it. He has put seven years of his life into promoting Bitcoin full time. And since he was one of the first people to really 'get it', and to promote and invest in Bitcoin in a big way, he probably thinks of Bitcoin as his baby. So he is obviously very attached to the name. And since BCH works in the same way as Bitcoin did before 2016, and BTC does not, I understand why he maintains that BCH is the real Bitcoin. 

There's no denying that the main purpose and attractiveness of Bitcoin has aways been that we could send money peer-to-peer basically for free. When fees and confirmation times went up, Bitcoin stopped being Bitcoin."

livecoinwatch.com is far better than these crappy websites. It has some drawbacks, but it gives you a lot of real time useful information and a very nice set of features and pleasant graphics.
Looks like lots of people couldn't help to feel a little but hurt.. :p
Let them know as well
They've had the turd for a while now on other coins, you didn't mind then. Apparently now you do because it refers to your fav coin. 
A turd beside a surprisingly well priced coin bothers you? But the mudslinging, manipulating and downright fraud committed by the bcash shills is ok with you? I’ll never understand this sub. 
The turd symbolizes what they see as a shitcoin. BCH isnt the only coin with the symbol and you used it when the called other coins shit coins so you do care that they are against bch. Its ok though bc everyone here cares to. Not bad to just say you’re biased. 
Yea the turd might not have been needed, a triangle with a ! would have sufficed, but its nice that the front page gives important information like that.

At this point, given your assumptions and stated criteria, I can see why you draw the conclusions you do. Yet, your statement above is self-evidently incorrect: Given the existence of the BCH chain, this sub, many developers, this thread, and users like myself, it seems obvious that consensus is *still* forming.

I don't know how things will play out. But it is possible for the BCH chain to pass the BTC chain in proof of work in the future. If that happens, then your criteria would cause you to ""switch chains"".

As for the ""Bitcoin.com"" and @bitcoin twitter handle, I couldn't care less. Bitcoin.com had links to bitcoin.org, right? I think it would be great to be like:

""Hey, this is not the cryptocurrency known as bitcoin, you can find that here: bitcoin.org. Before you go take a look at this comparison of them"" - That way it's impossible for them to claim we're trying to mislead people and we still get our message out. We accomplish the same thing and seem more honest. 

---

That aside, there's more than just that lending to the idea that ""BCH Shills"" are misleading people and a lot of people in this thread are delusional to think otherwise. I've seen several comments like ""We aren't trying to confuse them""... Well somebody fucking is. If you haven't seen the comments saying stuff like ""Well BCH is the real bitcoin"" I don't even believe you can read. It happens all the time, and I have a couple thoughts on it. 

First, If you are the ones saying BCH is the real bitcoin, what's wrong with ""Well BCH is the one that follows the original paper"" or something. That way you don't seem shady and still have a good reason for the naming convention. 

Second, I think some of the people that say shit like that are actually core supporters. They say something stupid that is easily disproved or obviously sounds like a scam to make BCH look bad. It's a form of [astroturfing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroturfing). They pretend to be BCH supporters and shout a bunch of dumb shit to make BCH supporters seem dumber, and to be loud enough to cover up actual benefits to BCH that are being talked about.

I have two problems with the argument of BCH being the ""real bitcoin"".

1. I don't think we are the real one and this is one thing I personally strongly disagree with memorydealer on. We are not bitcoin. There was a vote, segwit won. Satoshi's paper itself says ""They vote with their CPU power, expressing their acceptance of...{stuff about valid blocks}...Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism"". So by satoshi's original definition, core is the real bitcoin, we are the fork. I think there's a strong parallel here with the president. Some people said ""not my president""... bitch, he's in the fucking white house so yes he is. You don't have to like him but he is literally the president. 

2. why does it matter? The ""real bitcoin"" doesn't make us more valuable or more useful as a currency. It changes nothing so there's no point wasting breath debating it. We need to be talking about the merits of big blocks over segwit and lightning, and we need to have honest conversations about it. We also need to be improving (which we are). Big blocks isn't enough. If big blocks is the only thing differentiating us, they'll steal it if it works and keep doing what they're doing if it doesn't work.

As a follow up to thinking that it isn't important: 

""Never argue with an idiot, they'll drag you down to their level and beat you with experience."" - George Carlin.

That stands perfectly for what we are doing. We're so busy shouting back and forth that nobody has bothered to fix ourselves before casting the proverbial first stone. When you see somebody say something that is wrong but in support of BCH, take the time to correct them. It's worth it. What will core say when we really can't be accused of being misleading. Their main argument is ""big blocks are too expensive"" and ""BCash shills are liars"" so let's stop feeding the lie. It doesn't matter if we agree on who the real one is because the outcome doesn't make a difference to the technology's usefulness. If we get rid of their ability to say that we are liars, then all they have left is the block size argument. For that we can let the tech speak for itself. "

That's just passive aggressive. Unprofessional.
No one cares about this small crappy site. They just want to grab attention of core puppets. 
Rightfully so
That's only natural when you make the whole point of your campaign the continuous effort to demoralize your rivals.
ShitCoin. Knockoff. CarbonCopy. Fugazzi. Period. That. Is. It.
Hint: They're correct.
LMAO. BTC is a shitcoin 
The thing is that they are right.

sucks for them
"great. BCH and BCD are shitcoins, yet BTG and BTCP and other ""bitcoins"" are not???"
"lol, they complain about ""taking over"" a domain and twitter handle. Hmm, who took over the dev team of Bitcoin?"
"Exactly.  It's an obscure website that I've never heard of.

Never heard of that coin stats site before. Probably only 5 people use it (Tabman, Monotooth, Scragglebeard and the two supreme leaders of North Corea). Check out https://livecoinwatch.com which is the best.

Nice. Soon BCH will be able to support 100 million users.
Correct, but would mean something about half the capacity of PayPal now which is a pretty awesome goal. The idea is that TB drives aren't that expensive anymore and continue to drop in value (or expand in more TB's) that doesn't include any issues with bandwidth and latency though.
"so this is not a fork... no new coins ? hope that is the case :)

"
It's been rehashed a million times. r/btc is where people that got banned from r/bitcoin for not parroting the Blockstream Gods ended up. Since a lot of us are old timers from when BTC was actually useful, it was a natural progression for this sub to lean BCH since it's undisputedly closer to what BTC was once upon a time. 
Good bot.
Understandable, have a nice day.
"May have been asked but to lazy to read everything, ho will I be able to get my forked coins from my coinbase / ledger wallets? 

Viva"
I just want to drunkenly say, you peeps are my boys. I been around these parts a long ass time under various /r/Bitcoin banned accounts over the years. Bitcoin cash is dat real bitcoin. I love you all. Fuck BCORE. We will will this.
