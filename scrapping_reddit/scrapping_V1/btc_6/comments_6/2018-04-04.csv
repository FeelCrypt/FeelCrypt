When did you first realize MtGox might not be solvent?
It could be anything, he is just in a legal proceeding, so people have accused him of it I guess
There is strong evidence that Bitcoin went missing when the business was being transitioned from Jed to Mark. As I recall it was somewhere around 87k +/- 5k. After Jed had sold the business, and he was transferring assets, he told Mark that some Bitcoin had gone missing. There is a chat log that has been made public out there.
A debt portfolio should be what is owned to customers by an exchange at any given time. You are reading into it.
I'm afraid I can't comment further at this point due to ongoing legal proceedings.
Actually it's been quite a long time since the last one, if you exclude random anonymous reddit comments.
"There’s so much hate because he committed massive fraud! And now he’s trying to pretend to be a good guy, which he clearly isn’t. He will be in jail soon anyway so it doesn’t matter.

Does everyone here have memory loss? MtGox did not end well and it certainly wasn’t a victory for our community. Not sure what you are referencing"
Yeah he had some side business he was taking customer deposits to help fund. Clearly illegal
Yeah there was a mtgox coffee shop (in the company headquarters). 
No, you had it right. It was your seismograph. It was registering your last trip to the fridge.

Roger Ver never said they were solvent, he just said that the withdrawal problems were due to banking problems rather than insolvency (which was true).
It took some time after the withdrawals were suspended to audit all the wallets, and after it was found a large volume of BTC was missing discuss with lawyers/court how to proceed.

That's fair. I'd be interested in reading an article about the lessons you learned trying to scale. I think you'd have a unique perspective on it. I hope you find the time to do something like that. Once you clear the current legal challenges, of course. Good luck duder. 
They don't have a say in this though. They have no legal right to claim anymore than the value at the time.
Thanks for dropping by and answering questions for us Mark.
Thanks a lot for your answer. That was my feeling as well! Would you allow a new company or some market maker give the same conditions or was it really very selective ? Just wondering how to get in. Pretty interesting MM and as you said it doesn’t make sense without such special conditions.
If MtGox would have continues as an exchange for Magic the Gathering cards do you think your life would have been better or worse than it is now? 
"This is quite the answer! MtGox original domain meaning= Magic The Gathering Online eXchange
"
Are you sure about that?!?!?!?!
Yeah, not sure if that's been proven, but we're thinking of the same one probably. Bitgrail was the first exchange built around Raiblocks, now called NANO.
Thanks for taking the time to respond.  All of what you've been going through happened before I really knew much about Bitcoin, but the whole episode is something I looked into during my research before getting involved.
volatility is diminishing as the transaction volume grows. This is evident even with this crash.

"Did you think about asking Satoshi if he would donate some of his stash towards the creditors?

It would help bitcoin immense if its final clear that satoshi doesnt have anymore coins and for himself he would also be much more safe if he doesnt own that much anymore.

Please contact him or ask nick szabo"
"I have done that blockchain analysis, hence my claim that he's a fraud and not a thief (at least not in the sense of stealing those coins). In addition to claiming to own coins stolen out of MtGox as well as coins clearly controlled by MtGox, several of the other claimed addresses can also be confidently tied to other people rather than to Wright. As far as anyone can tell, Wright himself never historically owned any significant amount of bitcoin, and just runs around pretending to own other people's bitcoin instead. That he included stolen MtGox coins in his list simply reinforces that he had no idea what any of those addresses were, or he would have presumably avoided ""implicating"" himself.

When the news of the lawsuit hit, Wright quickly denied that these coins were the fabled ""Tulip Trust"", so I guess now you're supposed to believe that there's *another* million BTC in a trust somewhere out there that he totally for sure owns (pinky-swear), unrelated to the million BTC in a trust that he was just caught lying about? Uh-huh.

When you find yourself jumping through hoops to still extend him the benefit of the doubt after so many patently untrue claims, haven't you gotten the burden of proof all wrong here? Just write him off as a pathological liar already and don't let him waste your time. If he wants to be taken seriously, he can provide proof of his claims at any time -- as it happens, Satoshi Nakamoto invented a great system for it."
I think [he already did an analysis on Craig Wright](https://blog.wizsec.jp/2018/02/kleiman-v-craig-wright-bitcoins.html).
Welcome participation, reject bullshit.
Its proof its him.  Unbelievable but true. 
Google pgp message. 
Not at a PC at the moment so can't verify but he encrypted a message using his own PGP key. If you use his public PGP key to decrypt the above, there should be a plaintext message that gets spit out. This shows that he is the real deal as guessing his private PGP key to create the message in the first place would be pretty much impossible (assuming he didn't have to forfeit this in plaintext during his ordeal).
"At the time the trustee indeed said something to the effect that BTC payments, if they ever happened, would be possible only to people who filed through Kraken.

Civil rehabilitation will however likely change this."
There are about 16 million coins in circulation. 35 000 is about 0,25 % of that. If selling 0,25% of the supply can crash the market Bitcoin markets have HUGE problems. Maybe this explains the hodl meme, because as soon as people will start selling at all the market will crash. 
I do not know exactly for the script, this was handled by someone else at the company. I haven't authorized any payment related to this video however. I can't say enough how sorry I am about the result this video had on Roger's reputation.
Afaik the trustee has said he didn't use an ordinary sell order on an exchange.

Putting together such a plan involves discussing with lawyers what is possible, with potential partners if they'd be willing to pitch in, spending money and creating a new future for this bankruptcy. It means talking with creditors to evaluate what they'd like to see happen.

Never seen this one. Thanks a lot. This is the super kind of interesting intriguing spionage equest stuff that is so nice about Bitcoin. I bookmarked it and will watch it soon. 
I have a suggestion for you .  You should tell Kim Nilsson of WizSec to do some blockchain analysis on Nchain and Craig Wright.  The reason for this is that documents released in the Kleiman v Wright case indicated Craig may have claimed to hold private keys to Gox addresses.  Kim Nilsson already released an article stating this was proof Craig was a fraud, but it could also be proof Craig is a thief.  I doubt Craig is a thief and I actually think he is Satoshi, but if the documents in the case are legitimate and Craig claimed to own private keys to Gox addresses then the Gox creditors deserve to know why as that is highly suspicious.  His Tulip Trust is supposed to complete in 2020 so Kim Nilsson should just watch and ensure that he can't trace the coins that Craig moves out of the trust back to stolen Gox coins that he has been moving around through wallets owned by his associates for years to cover his theft.  Again, not trying to stir up heat in this community about CSW, I think he is Satoshi, but if he is a thief we need to know so someone should investigate the Bitcoin addresses in the claims in the documents of the Kleiman v Wright.

This is good for Bitcoin.
"From the link you provided. ""Finally--at some point the capacity increases from the above may not be enough. Delivery on relay improvements, segwit fraud proofs, dynamic block size controls, and other advances in technology will reduce the risk and therefore controversy around moderate block size increase proposals (such as 2/4/8 rescaled to respect segwit's increase). Bitcoin will be able to move forward with these increases when improvements and understanding render their risks widely acceptable relative to the risks of not deploying them. In Bitcoin Core we should keep patches ready to implement them as the need and the will arises, to keep the basic software engineering from being the limiting factor."""
"https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/capacity-increases

That's the current operative roadmap. Nothing there about a 2MB upgrade.

> Saying bitcoin will never have a blocksize increase is like saying that bitcoin cash will never include things like lightning network. 

No, it's different, because Core will have to do something to prevent replay attacks against the 1MB chain.  In doing so, it will render itself an altcoin.  Lighting Network could be deployed on BCH without even a hardfork.  It's a second layer, it needs no permission from the first."
The plan was to increase the block size to 2mb as well as include segwit. That was the roadmap. When bitcoin cash broke off from bitcoin, it split the community and made the idea of another hard fork very hard. But this is a short term problem. Saying bitcoin will never have a blocksize increase is like saying that bitcoin cash will never include things like lightning network. 
"If it were due to the usual issues, then you seem to be implying more but still havn't said. 

I'm personally gonna drop this for now."
I disagree. There is already a big block fork of Bitcoin. The community of people who support big blocks are already here. BTC is the community for people who support 1MB + Segwit.  An attempt to raise the BTC block size will merely split that coin again.
"Well, good luck with that.  If you think there won't always be a group sufficient to stymie an upgrade, you're in for a bad time.

As long as people keep mining and holding the 1MB coin then that chain will keep being ""BTC"", upgrades will require replay protection and therefore be an altcoin."

>So I don't think Roger was doing anything wrong just reflecting what he had been shown in exchange for his own bitcoins.

If it was a condition for Roger to have his account ""unlocked"", what did he do to have it locked in the first place? 

At best, you make it sound like extortion and Roger complying with it. That's not a good thing and should have raised suspicions.

I don't really want to go on about this however. Someone else will have to continue if they want. I'm not interested enough."
That's far from a given, and we're not sure that was the case even in the past. It will likely be sold in batches, but an auction is probably more likely than OTC.
"Thank you.

Civil rehabilitation may help avoiding assets being sold. Hopefully more will become clear about this as we move forward in the process."
"""Give""? Taking anything he owns (including one of his lungs .. since he has two..) and bury him in a jail, would be sensible and appropriate."
Or maybe **someone** does want it. Follow the money. Who would benefit from Mark getting all the money AFTER taxes, and then Mark distributing the money to creditors AFTER taxes?
Not sure if giving them more money is the same as more power. I assume they have enough money as it is that a bit more won't really change anything (and therefore an unbiased payout seems smart, to avoid invalidating the entire process)
I never said that either!
"BTC cannot scale above 1MB block size because so many of it's users have been conditioned to view larger blocks as a slippery slope to inevitable failure. The BTC community will always have many 1MB4EVAs.

To upgrade block size would therefore require that the large block ""upgrade"" implement replay protection to protect the small block ""original"" chain, which would make the upgraded chain an altcoin, no better than BCH."
"The transaction limit is 1MB the block limit is now called a block weight limit. And the old block size limit is now conveniently called the none witness data limit.

If you find that confusing get a BS/Core shill to explain it."
"8 MB actually. Seems like the protocol is currently limited to 32MB.

There is a plan to bump the limit to the 32MB supported by the current protocol somewhere in May."
That's some insane innovation going on right there. /s :)

So basically all the assets need to be sold, and will likely be sold in batches and on OTC markets, like the last times.

So 160 thousand btc left to just dump on the market because of technicalities. Even though literally **no one** involved wants that, at all.

At the time the point was to prevent transaction malleability, which was possible by creating a withdraw then changing its hash. Deposits weren't affected.

MtGox was probably already a good business with future potential. Why would he do that.
truly visionary.
This is what you should do. Whatever money you get out of this should be distributed back to people who lost their bitcoins, as much as is possible. Walking away from this broke but with the people who lost their bitcoins repaid as much as you can should be your goal.
if you're going to give extra money to creditors, can you please please please refrain from giving any money more than required by law, to greg maxwell, luke jr, and peter wuille? 
Yes that is the video he means 
"Yes, that one. Thanks for looking up the date, I was thinking the MtGox bankruptcy and withdrawal issues were one and the same and this video occurred around the same time.

I find it hard to believe Mark was clueless about the state of his business when he asked Roger to make that video. "
">  I haven't authorized any payment related to this video however

You are actually implying that you didn't authorized it, but Roger Ver may have been paid for the video where he claims that Mt.Gox was OK and it had enough liquidity? If he invited you to post here to relieve his image, it's actually obtaining the opposite result.

You, and your friend, should be ashamed to put your name on anything related to the Bitcoin. I hope you to rot in jail (and I mean literally).

"I know he never said anything incrimination it was all qualified with ""what I've been shown."" "
Why not closing the deposits too?
As the story goes, it first seemed like all the money was gone, but then you suddenly found 200k BTC. Is that accurate? It seemed like you really had no clue how much money you had or were supposed to have. Did you have any logs or checks or monitoring in place or was it really the mess it sounds like it was?

"Diminishing huh? So when did we last see a 75% drop in price? Pretty sure that was exactly around the time *the biggest exchange in ecosphere got hacked*. 

It seems to me, if anything, that over time it got even more volatile. What ""real shitty news"" did we receive in Jan-March, that could justify, being up to par with Mtgox 80% volume hack? What did we have that was so concerning? We had Binance FUD, China FUD, SK FUD. That's it. Coinbase wasn't hacked, neither was Bitfiniex, nothing really happened.



And we still dropped 75%. 




I actually believe that people going in the market, are now less and less required to be smart about the tech behind it. I'd argue people in the past were more so in it for the tech, than for pure speculation. This is why, new people, with no idea, buying BTC at 18000$.  



In other words, as adoption grows and tech becomes easier to use, also implies that less techy people get involved, which means a lot of weak hands will enter the deck. 


How will your momma react, when BTC drops 15% in one day? It's safe and sound, I will HODL until I die? Does she panic sell? "
Thank you to you too. Hopefully this bankruptcy gets resolved soon with all assets distributed to creditors and we can move past this.
I think doge lives in a larger home not in the heart of Tokyo. Very roomy. Much walks. etc..
MtGox, as a private company, requires share transfers to be approved & recorded by the company. Because it is bankrupt I do not believe anything was approved.
Common sense. 
He's not
"Bc it is glaringly obvious he is not. He lied about his credentials. He studied theology. He’s a sham. 

More than likely it is Tatsuaki Okamoto or someone who knows him. It isn’t some guy who read the Bible and googled ‘how to crypto.’ It would be someone who had a long history of working in the industry in academia, government, and private industry. I mean all three. IE a university, writing research, and working for the NSA. Like Tatsuaki Okamoto. This sort of knowledge doesn’t just spring up over night. 

“Recently, several “divisible” untraceable off-line electronic cash schemes have been presented [8, 11, 19, 20]. This paper presents the first practical “divisible” untraceable1 off-line cash scheme” 

“we prove the security of the proposed cash scheme under some cryptographic assumptions. Our scheme is the first “practical divisible” untraceable off-line cash scheme whose cryptographic security assumptions are theoretically clarified.” 

“Note that coins divided from the same coin can be linked each other in the proposed scheme, although they are anonymous, i.e., “untraceable” from the customer’s identity. In other words, the unlinkability among divided coins is not satisfied, although the untraceability is satisfied.” 

This is from 1995. Annual International Advances in Cryptology Conference. Tatsuaki Okamoto submitted his paper in conjunction with NTT laboratories. PhD in Applied Math entirely achieved through University of Tokyo. Was working on this and wrote about it since the mid 80s. Also worked with the NSA. 

If it is not him it is someone who knows him very well. He may not know who it is but he likely has a good idea. It may not be him but someone followed his work very close.

"**Gaslighting**

Gaslighting is a form of manipulation that seeks to sow seeds of doubt in a targeted individual or in members of a targeted group, hoping to make them question their own memory, perception, and sanity. Using persistent denial, misdirection, contradiction, and lying, it attempts to destabilize the target and delegitimize the target's belief.

Instances may range from the denial by an abuser that previous abusive incidents ever occurred up to the staging of bizarre events by the abuser with the intention of disorienting the victim. The term owes its origin to the 1938 Patrick Hamilton play Gas Light and its 1940 and 1944 film adaptations.

How is the price determined in Bitcoin? The short answer is supply and demand, but on inspection, this is not like any other ""thing"" in history, I'll venture out on a limb and say it is the most supply inelastic thing ever.  

The price comes from speculation on future value. Arguably the value proposition does not change. The price goes up because of investor exuberance FOMO, and it comes back down when that fades. It is most accurately expressed in the [Mania and Blow-off phase in the hype cycle](https://bravenewcoin.com/assets/Uploads/_resampled/ResizedImageWzcyMCw0ODJd/four-stages-chart.jpg) when I entered Bitcoin we could see over 100% price growth in a day this volatility is diminishing as the network of speculators increases. 

While on the surface it may still look as volatile, daily volatility has shrunk and overall but not having looked at a measurement I can only express my opinion that I think the trend is still showing volatility decreasing over the 1, 7, 30, and 200-day moving averages. 

>What did we have that was so concerning?

a wake-up call. 

>Does she panic sell? 

She buys the dip. 

What is happening now is investors are forming a bitcoin brain the equivalent of a decentralized Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), and bitcoin neural pathways are being strengthened. Those ~~investors~~ neurons who make good solid pathways and work independently but cooperatively are made stronger, those who don't are discarded by the Darwinian evolutionary process. 

The biggest investors in bitcoin have never been technical, they have been people who understand the incentive design, this has not changed."
OK, thanks for the clarification. So Jed will probably have to give back that 1$ then.... which will be a good deal for him...

Laws are developed by people, for people. When the laws do not serve the people, the people are free to change the laws. Obviously, these specific laws may or may not continue to serve people.

"To my knowledge those documents with the Gox addresses were never provided by Craig, but instead were leaked to Gizmodo and Wired magazine.  The claim by the Craig Wright team is that Craig was being extorted and those documents were released by a hacker .  Because I have no idea what the truth is regarding who released the documents, and like you said there is no evidence of Craig Wright being a thief, then we need to explain Craig's immense Bitcoin fortune.  How do you explain Craig being bankrupt around 2008-2009 and never working again to now being insanely rich, self-funding much of the BCH infrastructure with his company Nchain that is internally funded?  Either he is pulling an elaborate scheme to say he is Satoshi to gain false respect (which he would be failing at miserably since everyone hates him), or he is telling the truth.  Occam's Razor says that the latter is more likely, since he has already failed at the former.  Therefore the more likely scenario is that Craig is Satoshi.  Then again, like Gavin Andresen wisely said ""People are weird.""  So I don't know.  "

Sounds exactly like bch to me. 
The person who bought hem might have.
So he claims, but the claim is ridiculous. Selling OTC still affects the market price. If the purchaser hadn't bought the coins through the trustee, he would have bought them elsewhere. In the grand scheme, more bitcoins enter circulation (supply increase), and demand on price setting exchanges went down.
"Yes, there are about 16 million in circulation, but the vast majority never/rarely move. The depth of selling 35,000 coins over the course of a few weeks can ""turn the ship"", so to speak. The downward pressure it creates can reverse the FOMO trend. Once people start getting scared, they start selling too, to lock in those immense 2017 gains (2000% from beginning of year). Either way, I don't care. Good for them as far as I'm concerned. Just pointing it out. And yes you are correct, the entire thing is a house of cards, and will probably continue to be for some time."
What's his public key?
Exactly. Limiting blocks to 1 mb is absolutely silly. Computers have improved so much in the last 10 years and we are still debating if floppy disk capacity is the maximum network can handle. Bitcoin Cash is focused on innovation not only in software but also hardware. This is a long term solution which will allow it to scale and make it truly mainstream.

1 During the heydey of Mt Gox you were the most popular bitcoin exchange. A lot of child traffickers who accepted bitcoin via pedophiles using backpage.com would have laundered some of their ill gotten gains on your exchange. Did you help authorities identify and arrest these sick people?

2 It's impossible for a gaijin like you to do millions of dollars worth of business in Japan without regularly paying the Yakuza. How much were these payments worth and did you ever suspect that the stolen coins, which you covered up for months, involved organized crime?

3 Did you create Willy Bot to artificially pump Bitcoin?

"I expect that your reply to this will be along the lines of 'it was always theirs', but have you considered how your ideal plan (returning the original BTC to creditors), however unlikely it is, is just rewarding people for their own ineptitude?

I'm sure you will agree that holding a large number of coins on an exchange in the first place was a foolish exercise, and if your plans come to fruition you will have made some people very wealthy not just because of the first mistake of leaving the coins sat on Gox, but also by forcing them to 'hodl'. 

If Gox had never happened, the vast majority of your creditors would have traded away, wasted and sold their BTC over the years. You would now be returning BTC to them and instantly making many of them extremely rich, by virtue of their own incompetence. If you buy a winning lottery ticket but are stupid enough to lose it, the lottery aren't going to give you the winnings anyway.

"I had about 40 bitcoins stolen from MtGox in 2012. The transaction was made from an IP address that was not my own.  I am from North America and the IP address that the transaction was made from was in Eastern Europe. 

I had sent an email to support and received an initial reply but no satisfactory follow up was made. At the time I chose not to pursue the matter further given the relatively low value of bitcoin. I was also disappointed in your system that sent me an email saying that a transaction was done from an IP that was not my own but that gave me know recourse and that did not make the site more secure.  A good security system would have blocked the transaction coming form a strange IP address until some sort of confirmation could be made.

I had given up hope of getting my coins back when I heard of the MtGox bankruptcy.  

Now however I wonder if there is a chance of reopening the investigation into my stolen coins and if I can be considered a creditor that is owed money by MtGox.

You scream black and blue that you were going to hold but this happening may have stopped a lot of people that would have sold and thus a blessing in disguise. The fact that you couldn’t sell could have also been a factor into why we had such a huge run up in the first place so whinging about not being able to get out at $19k may have never been possible. In the end I’m happy that people are getting their money back but feel it’s worth acknowledging this at least that’s how I see it. 
"I think there are various factors that lead to that impression:

* Silk Road opened in March 2011, when I took over MtGox
* The Silk Road operator created a home page with my hosting service (the only one to accept BTC at the time) to advertise silk road, resulting in silk road advertising page hosted on my own servers
* The bitcoin world was very small at the time, meaning MtGox would automatically profit from Silk Road
* Silk Road used multiple MtGox accounts to move bitcoins, resulting in a lot of connected transactions

Yet, after 2 years of reading my emails and investigating me, seizing 5 million USD from MtGox, US law enforcement couldn't find evidence I was behind Silk Road - and for good reason as I was never involved in Silk Road."
"I think right now Bitcoin fails both as a settlement system and as electronic cash. For now I feel Bitcoin is more of a wild horse traders are trying to ride and end up either very high or very low. Bitcoin's volatility isn't helping making it useful for any kind of financial transaction other than high volatility trading.

Luke Dash Jr didn't write any of the MtGox code, nor did he ever had any role within MtGox. MtGox only worked with his mining pool Eligius because it was a rather large pool at the time and willing to connect with MtGox to facilitate confirmation of transactions issued by MtGox."
I'm trying to remain neutral as much as possible on the fork. In theory when such a fork happens one of the two branches will eventually die, however in this case it's difficult to say what will happen.

All the good question are getting downvoted lol
I am currently working on a plan for Civil Rehabilitation with purpose of seeing all creditors eventually seeing returned to them the exact amount of BTC/BCH they had on their MtGox balance as soon as possible, by working with a sponsoring exchange that would support the civil rehabilitation, make it possible to distribute all remaining MtGox assets as soon as possible and put a large share of its revenue toward supporting a 100% refund (100% as in 1 BTC = 1 BTC/BCH).
Yeah I think it's widely known and accepted as fact that the willy bot was used to try to buy back the bitcoins it owned it's customers after the hack. This cause the first price rally to over a 1000 USD per Bitcoin. 
Qui ne dit mot, consent.
He has said elsewhere that he cannot comment on the Willy bot, but at this point it's known that it was operated by Mt. Gox/Mark.

This was in late February 2014. From there MtGox entered in contact with the Tokyo District Court and followed its suggestion of shutting down the website until the filing for civil rehabilitation went through.
"Don’t listen to anything he says. He first realized MtGox wasn’t solvent when the hack happened and then used willy bot and new customer deposits to make old customer withdrawals. It’s clearly a lie he found out right before the announcement. Shit was going down for a long time. He committed multiple crimes and will go to jail for a long time. Japan has an incredibly high conviction rate. They don’t press charges if they aren’t sure they have enough evidence for a conviction.

If this was truly an honest mistake and he didn’t try to cover it up, things would have gone down VERY differently.

Don’t forget the employees that came out and said he was using customer deposits for his stupid coffee shop side business"

Mark, don't listen to those few trolls here.  Those who listened to Kim Nillson's talk know that the truth of what happened was far more complex than people realize.  I'm not trying to remove blame from you but shit happens and people who held BTC at the exchange knew the risk.  Unfortunately I was one of them.  My question is this:  How realistic is it that creditors would be paid back fully?  I know the crypto world has expanded to many alt-coins now so you coould make profit from more than just Bitcoin itself, but to we are talking about over half a million BTC you would need to reimburse creditors.  That seems far beyond the revenue of any exchange even over multiple years, or am I wrong?
"> But the author points to an interesting quirk in the data: The Willy trades continued to be executed even when the MtGox site went down. In January, over the course of half an hour when the site was offline, four trades were executed that bore the hallmark of the bot. ""At a time no one else was able to trade, be it via API or otherwise, Willy was somehow able to continue as if nothing ever happened,"" says the author.

Did you run the Willy bot?"
If you could wind the clock back to 2013 somehow, what would you do differently in regards to Mt.Gox operating procedures, including the Willy Bot, and why?

"Hi Mark

Assuming civil rehab fails and normal bankruptcy ensues, is there anything (legally or otherwise) stopping you from distributing your 160,000 bitcoin proceeds back to deposit holders who held BTC balances and didn't get full face value? The list of claims and claimants are public record so you already have the information you need to do this fairly and properly."
The question was actually just a poll, to know what creditors wanted as a whole. The court could still issue an order to allow (or try to) payments in Bitcoin, but now that civil rehabilitation is on the table it's a much easier choice.
Do you accept any personal responsibility for the bankruptcy of MT Gox ?
Thank you very much.

2. Fair or not, I can only hope things will be clear with time. To be quite honest I'm spending much more time on trying to make things better for the bankruptcy to care about my own image (until people really pushed me to do an AMA because most people don't know about all this)."

He's clearly not.
"Japanese law dictates that you will get 400 bucks for each bitcoin which is what they were worth when bankruptcy took place.

So STFU."
Did you file a claim? The bankruptcy should be able to return most of your cash assets.
"The crypto exchange industry is lacking a lot in transparency, and while some movements happened back in 2014 after MtGox bankruptcy, everyone stopped providing transparency information on crypto holdings.

Smart contracts should allow exchanges to not actually hold crypto currencies to allow trading, that would be a good way to start making exchanges hacking-proof."

Absolutly. He is in one of my favorite [animes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)!
I was actually in full isolation, my contact with people was limited to lawyer visits (not many because the place was so far) and interactions with the guards.
The Trustee is doing this to the extent of the law that he can, and civil rehabilitation, if it happens, will lead to a more complete payout.
The engineering team was lacking, but what it was lacking most was my attention, as I had too many issues to deal with.

I'm too busy writing responses to notice. Hopefully this is not in vain.
I can only hope the person you bought equipment from, if he is a MtGox creditor, will see his funds paid back as soon as possible. If he didn't file, civil rehabilitation may make him able to.
Redditor /u/EIectronBoner has low karma in this subreddit.
"Identity on the blockchain can be interesting, however I fear it may be difficult to scale. 

UI/UX of software has improved a lot, including by adding failsafes and making everything easier. I like how some people also implemented custom address format with detection of where input errors are/etc."
I'm afraid it wouldn't be that easy. Doing so would make MtGox resume to pre-bankruptcy state, but then Bitcoins wouldn't be enough and MtGox would be bankrupt again.
I do not feel comfortable endorsing MtGox Legal for reasons I cited before (mostly the fact it involves collecting money). Considering my position I would never tell creditors to spend money.
A very small role, with over 1000 BTC stolen that way, but nothing [in comparison to the 530,000+ BTC stolen Alexander Vinnik ended laundering](https://blog.wizsec.jp/2017/07/breaking-open-mtgox-1.html).
I never was involved with Silk Road. I don't know about Ulbricht and quite frankly I feel sad about what happened to him.
None.
Engrish please!
"* Proving the account is yours is enough.
* If you filed a claim, then no. Monitor the situation and follow what's happening.
* The trustee likely still has access to those documents."
It's likely civil rehabilitation, if it happens, will open a new window for filing claims. Hopefully this will allow people who couldn't file to file.
I admit I had to check the other sub too and see what the tone was like. Much more negative over there. People seem very much on edge in that sub.
Hopefully unrelated. Bitcoin hasn't been at its best recently :(
Hopefully it'll be distributed as is to the creditors. In the worst case it should be sold OTC, a lot of people have put pressure on the trustee and the court to that effect.
I drink Japanese tea, such as sokenbicha. It's not coffee but it still contains caffeine.
Bitgrail is that exchange that implemented client side balance checks on withdrawals?
The fact that right now this is handled by the bankruptcy trustee and the court. In the case civil rehabilitation fails it'll be a few years and a lot of taxes before I actually receive anything out of that, but if it ever gets to that I'll try to distribute it back to creditors.
Ask a  meaningful question and stop jerking off to r/btc 
Pretty sure it isn't. Some Russian guy was even arrested in Greece in connection with this in July/August 2017.
I'm afraid it's too late but there may be ways to get your claim accepted anyway. If civil rehabilitation is approved, however, a new claim filing window will likely open and it'd be possible to file then.
Ideally, yes.
"> why do exchanges obviously do NOTHING against it?

Newsflash buddy: The exchanges are the ones behind the manipulation."
The fact remains that it was their BTC to lose, not Marks or anyone else’s.
Very sad. I'm trying my best to make the situation better.
Difficile à dire, la France a pas mal de retard ces derniers temps et n'a pas forcément de priorité en matière de technologie. Les régulations locales ne sont pas forcément les plus adaptées.
Never, actually. 
I will try to if it ever comes to that, but for now I'd rather focus on trying to make Civil Rehabitation happen, it'd avoid a lot of costs/taxes/etc.
"I'll avoid taking any position on this, mostly because I'm not involved in Bitcoin anymore to be informed enough.

As soon as you have communities with large number of people there will be various factions forming, and it can be positive just as it can be negative. I know everyone on both subs are hoping to see a better future, so I can only hope everyone will learn to accept each others."
"Right now the main issue for Bitcoin to act as ""Electronic Cash"" is the volatility. Years ago we used to think as bitcoin matured volatility would get better, but it turns out it isn't getting much better at all, and price still does those huge swings. Hopefully, one day..."
MtGox never allowed wash trading.
I have 200+ messages right now, but I'll probably get there eventually. Thanks.
I do not believe that to be the best scenario possible. Returning Bitcoins to creditors is priority number one. If they decide to build houses for gomeless people or throw the best party of all time then it's their call.
It depends on what your goal is, but using main exchanges such as BitFlyer or CoinBase is probably the safest.
If it comes to it I'll find a way to distribute it to creditors as much as possible. For now I'm trying to avoid such a result.
I have never played *Magic: The Gathering* actually. The name came from the previous owner, yet I get asked about this a lot.
"MtGox has always tried to keep a neutral stance, and minimize impact on the market of internal issues such as banking issues/etc.

It's not always easy for exchanges to act against things, however some things such as wash trading can be easily prevented (in MtGox system, if an order was about to match another order by the same user, it'd simply stop execution there).

I cannot comment on your last question at this point of time due to ongoing legal proceedings."
"Government approved exchanges (CoinBase, BitFlyer, etc) are less likely to face government opposition (duh) and as such are probably much safer for users as long as the use remains within what is allowed by law (ie. no tax evasion, drugs, etc).

Anyone who wants to engage in risky behavior will end having to take risks.

As to recent hearings a lot has to do with ICOs which in many cases see a lot of money funneled in projects not ready for this (or just plain fraudulent), and consumer protection comes first. This said cryptocurrencies will be an ongoing challenge for governments around the world for the years to come as it already been since at least 2013, and it seems so far the US is taking a positive stance toward crypto currencies."
Hi.
Actually, it turns out this might have been possible, as has been shown afterward by some exchanges. I think the main issue was the political pressure on the exchange which made entering civil rehabilitation a requirement.
I did not down vote, I did naaaahhhht
Same here... I assume at this point my coins are long gone though. Looking back at the entire situation I was stupid to not withdraw more than I did. I got hit for under 30 coins so not terrible I suppose. I have friends who lost thousands of coins.
I'll do my best to get this done. I'm sorry this is taking so long.
I do not think MtGox creditors would agree with that.
Unfortunately, no idea. I learned about this at the same time as everyone, and didn't get any more information.
"I do not know how much people out there would accept seeing me around, so I am not going to proactively do anything except do everything I can do to help with the MtGox bankruptcy.

If I can be useful to anyone, I'd be happy to help."
Yes, especially if non-custodian. Hopefully this will become the standard one day.
"1. Quite a lot. I'd guess I lost everyone except for a few close friends.
2. Now, life is pretty normal, except for court days."
"In two words: pretty bad. I spend the first 4 months and half of custody at the police station, where I was fed as everyone else simple cold food. Morning was some soup (actually the only thing hot) with a plate containing rice and a few extras, lunch was two breads with some jam and a small extra, dinner was a plate with rice and some extras (I write extras because it's mostly Japanese food, if I say chikuwa or aji-fry, I don't think everyone would understand).

The following 7 months were spent at the Tokyo Detention Center, which had actually warm food and more variation. I actually took on close to 5kg during those 7 months.

My cat was initially looked after by reported Jake Adelstein (despite his cat allergy) until a friend of mine could take over."

Thank you. I don't know how far it'll work, but I do know that not trying means it'll get nowhere.
It's not up to me to decide since the code IP (or part of it) belongs to MtGox.
I am sorry for how things happened. I unfortunately cannot comment further at this point of time because of ongoing proceedings.
">  Those who listened to Kim Nillson's talk know that the truth of what happened was far more complex than people realize.

Not to reply to my own post, but I am referring to your plan to have an exchange sponsor the civil rehabilitation.  I don't see how you can fully reimburse creditors from a sponsoring exchange.
I'm not involved enough in Bitcoin anymore to have an informed opinion on this.
It's difficult to say, but likely many years, unfortunately.

"Actually most exchange are making quite a lot of profit. CoinBase made the equivalent of some 150k BTC revenue last year, probably more because the price was lower at the beginning of the year.

There also remains the possibility bitcoins are found following the analysis of Alexander Vinnik's computers and other electronic devices. I wouldn't put too much hope there, but one never knows."
I am trying to resolve the MTGox bankruptcy in the best possible way. Bringing in some attention on the matter can't hurt.
"Yes, quite a lot. Not so much about crypto-currencies on a technical level, but about myself, and about the people involved.

The main part would be that I learned about my own limits. There is only so much someone can do, and there are times when delegating and finding the right partners can mean the difference between life and death."
Why did you ask Roger Ver to read a letter saying you were solvent?
It's the same reddit account he has used in the past. Would be nice to see a verification pic, though.
I’m still convinced he has a private key somewhere with loads of bitcoin on it
I'm staying neutral on the issue.
Why was MtGox kept open for trading after that while Bitcoin withdrawals already weren't possible anymore?
I wouldn't touch Tether until the US govt releases its pressure.
Thanks. I wasn't really sure what was the best so I decided going with both, despite the fact it may mean a lot of duplicated work.
When I was running a hosting company back in 2010, one of my customers, a French guy living in Peru, asked me if he could use Bitcoin. I looked into it and eventually implemented it as a new payment method while getting involved more in the community.
Probably 100 duck-sized horses. Horses can behave, angry ducks are straight scary.
"We had a few people we were working with who had a preferential fee schedule, direct access to the trading backend and were specifically working on market making.

I think such deals are quite common since any exchange needs a good and stable market."
"This question should be modified. It is by far not close enough.

1 horse-sized duck will kill you easily, but 100 duck-sized horses you can evade easily and then kill them one by one.

MtGox database contains details including status of all transfers. The trustee used that to approve claims.
If Satoshi sent 0.001 bitcoins from his wallet, wouldn't it mega-crash Bitcoin for a little bit, because it would increase the circulating supply by 1,000,000?
Wise and though provoking words from Electron Boner
Actually civil rehabilitation may be good news for you as it'll likely open a new window for filing claims. I'd suggest keeping up with updates on mtgox.com.
Thank you for your kind words.
I am currently not allowed to talk with Jed.
Please answer This xD
Trollolololo lololololo
You're assuming it's hassle free millions. You forget there's 25000 people who want their Bitcoins and will file lawsuits for the rest of Mark's life. 
I don't need money to enjoy life. What's important is to have the right people around.

He was obviously part of the sub before the fork when it was hijacked by bitcoin cash supporters
"For the 200k (160k now since some were sold) that were in cold storage, people would receive back the same coins.

Anything more distributed would be other coins coming from the market, so likely a mix of new and old."
You're either new or retarded

Humans are categorized by there mindfulness and gratitude. My category system is inclusive while yours appears exclusive. Each to there own, in the end, excluding people from your in-group works to your disadvantage.
