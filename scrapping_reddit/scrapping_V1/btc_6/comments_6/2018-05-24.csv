Any news on when you're planning to release the blockchain.info Explorer for the Bitcoin Cash network? I would really like to have one since blockchain.info is the best explorer.
"> It's hard to predict, but most people are forgetting the need for a strong credit market in a healthy economy.

This is a very good point, But when you think about it the need for credit does not go away, rather the problem is solved in other ways. **we are moving from a credit economy to an equity economy**. 


Rather than taking out a loan for a house bank will issue equity for a house on a blockchain. I will buy the equity of my house over time, market fluctuations will give my options to buy more or sell equity in my house. 

>So for BTC to work, market forces will need to create fractional reserve lending of BTC,

this is never going to happen while we are in the hyper-deflation stage. The next group of wealth creators are the ones who find solutions to this problem.

I come to the opposite conclusion when I think through the problem. But hey we are all speculating here, you have reasons to short Bitcoin, I have reasons to go long.   "
"BTC will eventually reach its peak real value, after which there is no upside to holding beyond keeping track with inflation (and that’s assuming it stabilises, which it won’t). That means long term it's a poor store of value.

The wealthy will only invest a small proportion in crypto as a hedge, no more than they would hold on cash, while continuing to hold the vast majority of their wealth in revenue generating instruments - property, securities, bonds etc, and that will continue irrespective. Sorry but the notion that crypto will somehow even the playing field is just wishful thinking."
I wonder if the market will go low enough to shake most average investors out
Hope to be part of this!!
"It's hard to predict, but most people are forgetting the need for a strong credit market in a healthy economy.

Here's the problem. People and businesses need to be able borrow. Lending has existed since the dawn of money. Without fractional reserve, credit will be hugely supply constrained (as it would rely on individuals being unable to access their deposits until they are repaid), causing high interest rates for BTC borrowing. So the borrowing market will resist BTC because they can borrow fiat at much lower rates. As loan repayments will be fiat denominated, they will need income streams linked in real value to fiat rather than BTC, and so adoption doesn't propagate.

So for BTC to work, market forces will need to create fractional reserve lending of BTC, establish a market for BTC borrowing, reward depositors with interest while protecting and allowing withdrawal of deposits. This will result in an *effective* increase in money supply. This means that if you looked at all the (in credit) BTC balances in all the custodial online wallets worldwide, it would add up to much more than 21M BTC, in fact without regulation limiting capital ratios, there would be no limit. Hello inflation."

I can't buy into pre-IPOs but anyone could have bought bitcoin.

I disagree with the rest of what you're saying, too.

> holding beyond keeping track with inflation (and that’s assuming it stabilises, which it won’t). That means long term it's a poor store of value.

Holding to beat inflation is good enough reason to hold. Stabilizing is relative. I don't think it will be BTC but there will a dominating crypto that will be relatively stable (slowly increasing as the economy puts in more little by little into the crypto, kind of like index funds). But if you don't believe crypto as money will revolutionize the world, I'm not sure why you're here.

I meant only even the playing field in terms of access to investment opportunities as the post image points out.  I don't disagree that most will only have some crypto as a hedge. "
"Ninja here. I chop machinegun bullets in half with a sword. 

Bitcoin is a wealth distribution various,  I agree with almost everything you said, you need to apply that knowledge when analyzing Bitcoin viral RNA. 

>Crypto will ~~just~~ help the 99% including the 1% obfuscate movements of funds so they can move more of their assets to ~~invisible offshore holdings~~ Swiss bank acounts in their pockets, and thus pay l~~ess~~ only the tax they deem reasnable.

FT;FU"
bad bot
The 1% would never put more than a fraction of wealth into BTC as a store of value, too volatile (high risk) and no underlying fundamentals. Instead they will use BTC as a transient means of payment to obfuscate the flow of their capital into offshore assets (property, securities etc), so they can avoid tax. Congratulations BTC, you just helped the rich get even richer.

"Sorry, this is a fantasy. If you think you can redistribute wealth by replacing fiat with a deflationary currency, you're bringing a knife to a gun fight. Inflation is of no consequence to the wealthy, they don't use such basic instruments as savings accounts to stay rich. Their wealth is mostly in revenue generating assets like property, equities and bonds, all of which outstrip inflation in the long term, and crypto won't change that.

Crypto will just help the 1% obfuscate movements of funds so they can move more of their assets to invisible offshore holdings, and thus pay less tax."
