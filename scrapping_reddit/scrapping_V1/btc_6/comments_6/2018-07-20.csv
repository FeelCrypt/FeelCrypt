Wow, this actually looks cool man!
Do you release this video as free to use for someone else that would like to use it in a promotional material?
"Love it! One request though. Please start aliging the B mark straight up. There are two reasons for this: 

1) BCH is bitcoin designed to actually be USED as a currency, and as such it's mark should follow typographical norms. No other currency mark is crooked. 

2) Coreons like to complain that we are being misleading any chance they get, and the BTC logo is crooked.

Edit for the downvoters: Fuckin fight me. "
i think it would be perfect if you eazed out the animation of the B logo spin coming to a stop
Thanks :)

Thanks for the tip - I'll keep that idea in mind 
looks like lots of practice :) but zero cats, so still can be improved
I basically just manipulated a ring in element 3D in after effects, added a particle system, animated the logo to do spiny things, added more particles, added a floor/reflections and then just tweaked everything

You use Fiverr? I would love to know that if I ever need something like this - you exist and sell your services
"That's cool. 

This is not a critique of your work but I'll share some observation on the subject.  I'm so sick and tired of seeing a B inside a circle as though it ever was a round coin. It actually has nothing to do with a geometric shape, and considering that it has eight decimal places, that's super super high resolution! compared to jaunty Dollars and sense Bitcoin is like liquid, liquid money. 

For example, whenever you pay with dollars and cents you give the cashier too much money! Almost every time you give the cashier too much money! And then he gives you back a little bit of money, your change.

That's very silly! it's an example of something silly that we're used to because everyone has known it since they were a child. the more logical thing is to pay exactly the right amount every single time , down to the finest Element of value, down to eight decimal places. With Bitcoin you can do that. One transaction only. You don't have to wait for a rebound transaction to get your "" ""change."" there is no need because there is no such thing. Why should there be.

Anyway, a very good creative challenge (if you're in the mood) would be to kill the silly round B. The visual concept is not doing anyone any good."
Badass
"Nicely done. Super fluid and crisp. 

If you add bullets of info that say: instant confirmation, smart contracts, less than a penny transaction fee... you basically made an awesome commercial for BCH

"> But if someone close to him is writing the tweets (e.g. his mother) than I don't see a reason why he couldn't speak freely.

"I think the ""2 crooked cops"" are even in prison, and ross was denied a retrial when he tried to get one based on the evidence of the ""2 crooked cops"". havent read about it in a while, so i may be off"
You laugh but Mitnick was put immediately into solitary confinement because the DA told the prison warden that if he got his hands on so much as a paperclip he'd set off our missile defense system.
"He will think twice what he tweets.  
It could have an impact on him down the road.

But if someone close to him is writing the tweets (e.g. his mother) than I don't see a reason why he couldn't speak freely."
Yet they still didn't convict him of that, so the judge decided to dispense his own form of justice?

I suggest you reread it.
If the Judicial branch took everything said on the internet seriously they would just put bars around Murika.

No, Ross was never tried for murder. Everything is explained here, with links to indictments and other important info: [https://freeross.org/making-a-murderer/](https://freeross.org/making-a-murderer/)"
Great point.  I’m a layman not a lawman so still confusing to me, but appreciate that perspective. 
Ever heard of “innocent until proven guilty”? He wasn’t ever charged with “procuring murder.” They did that to make him look bad and then dropped those charges because they knew people like you would still connect murder to him. 
"Why do you think they didn't even charge him given that the ""procuring murder"" part is so well known? You have to justify a life sentence for non violent crimes. Also remember that it was all based on evidence from two crooked cops. Set aside that bullshit propaganda that they put in your head preemptively."
It was to set an example, they had to do this or there'd be a ton more silk roads popping up, of course which is already happening anyways but a life sentence is certainly a deterrent. 
He still doesnt have access to internet. He hand writes his tweets and somebody tweets them for him. He prolly has asked every now and then, but considering he's trying to get out of a cage for life, I think he's got other focuses. 
Man the praise for this drug trafficker is ludicrous but I guess anything that used bitcoin must be super positive and great for humanity 
what about the part where he hired a hitman to kill someone to save himself? i think a big part of his sentencing was all the sketchy stuff he started doing in relation to that... 
Ross has internet. Julian Assange? At the bottom of the ocean for all we know.
Ross is Satoshi
"Though apparently removed from the indictment, “procuring murder” is hardly non-violent. It was factored into the severity of his sentence. 

Still seems harsh, but makes a little more sense. 

Edit: thanks for helping clear up that these were unproven and possibly rumors/smear.  TIL!"
Support to Ross and his family.
And already the giveaway scammers are all over his timeline.
Ross is really a hero. 
"Is it confirmed that this account is really Ross.? U know. There are many sickos out there. But good to see he still manages to communicate if that's his really tweet, knowing he got such injustice served. 


Regardless if he guilty or not USA fucked him up good. 
Shame. "
[deleted]
He should not be in prison, it upsets me that I belong to a society that condones morally repugnant stuff & as long as its legal, no problems, this guy scares those in power so the ruin what was essentially a young kids entire life, squash it & remove any hope. Makes me realise our society is no better than many that I used to feel superior to.
Wonder if he's checked the bitcoin price, lol.
Didn't know they have internet access in prison, wow.
"Did you actually think about what you just said??

The idea that something he was never found guilty of could have been “factored into the severity of his sentence” is grossly unjust. "
They we're violating a contract. So its *REALLY* not a violation of NAP. 
"If he would have a business and would accept BTC but also BCH you would never list him on bitcoin.org

"
Oh sorry. Didn't see your second sentence. My response was to the first question.
"That's a slippery slope.  But absolutely .... almost all the people I've spoke to in the crypto community feel IF he actually did that then it changes our opinions.  

However that's a BIG if and how the judge allowed it in the opening statements.  How the media prints it nonstop.  

Yet the prosecutor declined to charge him with hiring a hitman is awfully suspect.  

You'd think the prosecutor would have happily included it if they had any evidence at all.  "
Was he ever actually charged?
Bullshit, a life sentence means jack shit, which makes this all the more pathetic. They will never stop online drug sales, any law that can't be enforced is a shit law.
Considering his first coding experience was with the silk road (he learned to code as he built the site) he was pretty good. Yeah, the SR got hacked like 10 times, but considering he was a newb its not like he wouldn't get hacked. If Ed snowden and Ross switched roles itd be a different story. Ed is a computer genius and he knows a lot more about opsec even before the NSA or Booz Allen. Ross was a colllge student just learning. Imagine being asked to secure a site from skilled multinational hackers whilst learning hello world in HTML and JS.
So the consensus here is this is legit?
"I can't read human capital without thinking triangle trade route.
"
Who invited the moral police?
You wouldn't have someone killed to save yourself?
He was not convicted of that, so it can't have any bearing on sentencing. Punishment must fit the crime.

very unlikely its actually him online, he probably has sent out letters and has somebody transcribing them to twitter.
He hand writes the tweets and somebody else tweets them.
