I will say *I was there* to my children 
Not saying that's the right thing to do, but my bet is they're fine.
If I own some bitcoin now (0.08 lol), do I now also own some bitcoin cash?
As of this writing 12 blocks have been mined. Hopefully it'll speed up shortly.
"it's a little bit further away now but our rocket is much faster ;)"

You have both. I suspect /r/trezor will have a guide soon if they don't already.
As an /r/all user, this is so far the clearest explanation that doesn't go into blaming one side or the other. Thank you for this
When Bittrex enables BCH deposits, there will likely be a large inflow of BCH that will cause the price to drop.  I think this would be a good opportunity to buy BCH at a lower price.
Potentially, I guess I'd have to see. I'd prefer to avoid all forks if possible. I believe that the only major advantage bitcoin has over other cryptocurrencies is  the network effect. Splitting the community degrades the only advantage we have.
Not trolling, I just know the basics of bitcoin, used to mine a lil back in 2014, but haven't really paid attention to it since.
How do bigger blocks = non decentralized and not resistant to censorship?
My blocks are being orphaned
For now. 8mb blocks are likely to be routine once the coffees start coming.
"ELI5 - if I have Bitcoin currently, does that mean I have both BTC & BCH?

By which metrics?
Mods should add price to banner
You shouldn't buy BCH. If you do happen to have some due to having BTC during the split, then you should find a good time to sell it to maximize your BTC.
"So if I have my coins in a Bitcoin QT wallet, am I stuck on one side of the fork or can I decide when I restore my wallet?


Edit: I have asked a variation of this question earlier but I'm a little confused as my wallet says Bitcoin Core"
The data is there so yes technically there are Omni, Counterparty, and colored coin forks now. What matters there though is whether anyone in those communities is crazy enough to risk their future on bcash.
Just sent my first BCC/BTH transaction, which should be in about the 10th block (478569)
"How mining 'works' is pretty complicated and not something easily explained over reddit. Go look up some guides for the full story.

In short, though: mining difficulty (read: how much computer power you need to make $$) depends on how many other people are mining it. Unpopular coins can be mined profitably on CPU chips. GPUs are a step up in power, and most mid-range coins need a hefty GPU to make any real return on them. Bitcoin is hugely popular, so it needs mega equipment called ASICs that are machines that *only* mine, and take a lot of power. You need tens of thousands and a good electrical hookup to make any real money mining Bitcoin these days. Note that some coins were coded to be 'ASIC-resistant' to prevent centralization of hash-power in hubs, so that GPUs are the end game in the technical race. This is why video cards have gotten so bloody expensive recently... 

That said, you can pick a less popular coin (www.coinmarketcap.com) and mine it with your home computer, but be wary of the power cost of doing so, plus the constant strain will lower the lifespan of components, especially fans."
"It seems to me like BIP 140 would have fixed the malleability issue without a whole load of un-necessary overhead.

Malleability is caused by a single thing (inclusion of signatures in Tx ID) - common sense and good development practice would suggest you fix it by implementing BIP 140, then, which goes straight to the heart of the problem and fixes if in the simplest way possible

In terms of segwit, that seems like a convoluted justification at best: what was wrong with BIP 140? If nothing, then malleability shouldn't be used as a justification for segwit, because it isn't even the best solution (BIP140 always fixes malleability, while segwit only does so if the entire transaction on both sides is segwit)

By your own logic, then (applications need reliable Tx IDs), we still need BIP140 even after segwit, because malleability isn't solved and Tx IDs are not 100% reliable (and until we see how strongly segwit is adopted, it could be well below 100%)

On malleability, segwit is an incomplete solution that adds a ton of complexity, when a better, simpler solution exists and will have to be implemented anyway...

I don't know about you, but that doesn't seem like enough to me"
"This added complexity sure does make it difficult for developers to develop.

Bitcoin with segregated witness is far more complicated to newcomers and more complex for future developments. It ruins the usefulness of the whitepaper, though that was a stated goal of supporters.

Mostly though it doesn't solve any scaling issue but makes a scaling fix more complex"
"No it is not.

That's like saying Russia state sponsored media outlet is the best place to learn about world news. 

You'll only learn highly biased and probably misleading I formation."
"> Sure, but we have to compromise a lot in this decentralized experiment. 

I think bitcoin cash demonstrates that we actually don't have to compromise.

It doesn't seem like many people actually like segwit2x, they just thought they had no choice and needed to compromise. I wouldn't be surprised to see the 2x part fall through, so that there are only a 1mb core bitcoin and bitcoin cash."
Joining the chain!
Where are you seeing this???
Read the FAQ and try some google. 
Big blockers can finally go do their thing and let the grownups continue to advance Bitcoin.
Bitcoin has been stone walled for years by a company named Blockstream who hired most of the most prominent developers. They tried to change Bitcoin from being a P2P ecash system as proposed by the original whitepaper to a restricted settlement system for their middleman products. Bitcoin Cash is a fork of the software using the same transaction historic but by increasing the capacity by 8X and refusing to implement Segwit (Blockstream's solution to allow their middleman products). 
"I wouldn't say they are years ahead. ETH showed us a more efficient pump & dump and some of the potential dangers of smart contracts, but still nothing has come out that invalidates bitcoin's position. Some of the storage coins might show us how to establish a real decentralized marketplace, but they likely won't be a liquidity/entry place into the crypto space.

Bitcoin's main advantage is that you can use it to buy things and there are many places over the world that you can buy and sell bitcoin for regular fiat currency. No other cryptocurrency has a real world network like bitcoin.

Until another coin actually has a killer feature bitcoin should just work on not losing any of it's good properties."
If you already have btc then you have bch now. If you want to find a market to buy some just look at coinmarketcap.com in the bch section go under markets.
"Right, it would take at least half an hour, maybe a couple hours to coordinate over 50% of the network if everybody at all the main pools were hiking in Siberia or something.

There's a small risk to rejecting one out of ten blocks for a while to suppress a spam attack. There's a much larger risk to miners in having the price crash due to hours or days of a congested, useless blockchain.

That's not to say the miners couldn't pull off the same attack if they all colluded, but we all know there are a number of ways to pull off a 51% attack."
"The fundamental layer is not meant to be simple, but it should support innovation. We don't need thousands of developers working on the fundamental layer, we need innovation on top of that.

Software can hide complex stuff on the lower level. That is why we can make websites without knowing how a browser works, or desktop apps without knowing how a compiler works, or create documents without knowing how Word works. The same will happen with Bitcoin. SegWit allows more flexibility and freedom in future applications.

Low level systems are always complex and abstract because they need to support everything, even unimagined, on top of it. "
Did you actually go to the link and read or did you just look at the URL? /u/audigex asked a genuine what bugs/problems SegWit tries to solve and I provided a link which describes just that.
Yup.
These bcash miners aren't all there. We have the hostel that seems to be 51% attacking and segwit. Something's not right in forkytown.
9 down now. Weren't people saying this would take days or weeks to lock in the first six needed?
"> Right, it would take at least half an hour, maybe a couple hours to coordinate over 50% of the network if everybody at all the main pools were hiking in Siberia or something.

This is honestly the most in depth analysis I have read on the subject, but obviously you'd need a bit more than ""/u/Gmbtd said it was fine on reddit unless the main pools where hiking in siberia or something."" And please take the chinese firewall into account in any further analysis."
"And I pointed out that you should let people investigate themselves.

Bitcoincore is a highly biased and misleading source, that's all"
Dude, why are you still even arguing this?  The guy said that 1.7mb was the *maximum* blocksize under segwit.  That's factually incorrect.  All I did was correct him.  There is no circumstance in which you're correct here.  Just drop it.   
"I'm confused, do you think the Chinese firewall prevents the guys who met and agreed to segwit 2x from posting on their slack channels or picking up the phone and calling each other? It's not like there are thousands of mining pools, over half the hash power goes through just 4 pools, and the largest 8 pools are all Chinese (so they wouldn't even have to communicate outside of China to coordinate, assuming for some reason that phones, slack channels etc were all suddenly blocked).

Major mining operations work like data centers where they're at least minimally staffed around the clock.

The speed of response to a major attack depends more on the complexity of the response than any lag in communication between the miners!

That said, we're talking about orphaning malicious blocks that can be done at the pool level by simply refusing to update pool members of the new block. I'm sure there are other attacks that could hypothetically require a change in mining software (like blocking covert asicboost required a soft fork) and they would take much longer for miners to roll out updated firmware."
"Your walking such a thin line and now you have me confused.  The theoretical maximum?  You are correct in that Segwit can handle 1.7x the multisig transactions as the 1mb temp limit Bitcoin block, not limited to 1.7mb.  I still cannot stuff 3.7mb of Bitcoin transactions into a Segwit block.  And so yes, if Segwit survives awhile, you are technically correct, that someday a 3.7mb Segwit block may be formed. An 8mb Bitcoin block is much better than a 1 or 3.7mb Segwit block in every measurable sense I care about.  

So yes, if your point was merely to correct his error, fine, but then you claimed, ""It would still take 4 blocks without segwit."" and my claim it will still take 4 blocks with Segwit, and you have done nothing to prove that wrong or even counter it.  You just chose to be your usual dense self and argue something I never said."
"Those are good points. Sadly, there is a lot of politics involved and we ended with SegWit. SegWit already is a compromise in many ways, although many did not agree with it.

It just think it is the best we have right now and should move forward with it. Also in favor of a block increase. 

I am fine with the current fork and seeing how that evolves. I was sick of the stalemate. "
Thank you, that clears it up 
That is going to happen with any system. You need to design a system that can handle attacks. If your system cannot withstand attacks, it isn't a good system and needs fixing.
That's a big risk: if a miner acts against you without knowing what other miners do (s)he is mining against the network.
For bitcoin the energy you will use is more expensive than the gain on normal consumer hardware, even if you have cheap energy like 8 cents per kWh.

"Yeah, and when the network stopped being spammed, the meme pool emptied and transaction times and fees are down again.

I'm not saying one coin is better than the other. Just that it's worth acknowledgement that bad actors were trying to influence your opinion exactly as you have stated..."
"What do you say to this person? 

http://reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/6ndfut/buttcoin_is_decentralized_in_5_nodes/dkant1i"
Yes, it's permanent. As of now, if you're buying Bitcoins (BTC), nothing changes for you. However, if a merchant accepts Bitcoin Cash (BCH) down the line, you'll need to buy that separately. (Easiest way to think about it is as an altcoin, like Litecoin or Ethereum) 
In short, yes.  If that QR code (which I assume is your private key) held Bitcoins prior to the split, then it now contains that amount of Bitcoin Core coins and Bitcoin Cash coins.  To spend your coins, it's best you split the two types of coins two separate addresses first.  Also, you will need to use your private key with a bitcoin cash compatible wallet to do anything with the bitcoin cash coins.
I like malleability fixes, but I prefer a hard fork solution.
You have them. Checking my recent history should give you a path to split them.
Where do I buy BCH right now because coin base doesn't support it
"And when Lightning Network is actually working as described in its [white paper](https://lightning.network/lightning-network-paper.pdf) and not just vaporware in a lab being used to stall progress, we'll have it on Bitcoin Cash! Bitcoin is permissionless: we couldn't prevent a 2nd layer technology if we tried. It would be like TCPIP somehow trying to keep HTML off the network. The very idea is absurd. Figuratively speaking, Bitcoin will support ""HTML"" and also ""SMTP"" and ""FTP"" too - there should be a healthy ecosystem of ""Layer 2"" technologies and Bitcoin Cash will be agnostic to them, just as TCPIP is agnostic to HTML vs SMTP.

Here's the kicker: since Bitcoin Cash already offers 4x the transaction throughput compared to ""2MB"" SW2X (the ""2MB"" part being quite in doubt) it can support Lightning Network *even better* than ""Segwitcoin"".  Lightning Network becomes problematic with always-full blocks, and onchain transactions are required to create Lightning Network channels, so the block size limit functions like a new-user-onboarding limit. Bitcoin Cash can onboard 4-8x more users every day than ""Segwitcoin.""

[Bitcoin Cash](http://bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf) is... just better. "
Why would I do that?  Narrative-spinning is kind of the whole point of r/btc.
"How is SegWit built on the idea of full blocks? Does it not work with half-full blocks?

KISS is a good general rule, but does not always hold for fundamental layers like Bitcoin or the Linux kernel. It should apply to higher level applications though and I believe SegWit allows for that."
"Sure, but we have to compromise a lot in this decentralized experiment. 

In the end, the soft fork is not that bad in my opinion, but I did prefer the hard fork solution at first. "

"Is there anywhere I can see current hash-rate? May be a dumb question, but I'm no techie. So far I've watched cash.coin.dance and see that 25% of blocks are mined by viabtc which currently has ~70PH/s on BCC/BCH indicating a hash rate at around 300PH/s, but this is probably a flawed way of doing it and also the number of blocks mined are so small the 25% may be way off. 

Also, should we be concerned viabtc has reduced their hash-rate for BCC/BCH a lot since just after the fork?"
"It means everyone will have the chance to prove their beliefs for the future of bitcoin. 

Time will tell who will provide the best service and the community is the biggest winner in the end, cause we will have good products for every taste. "
"We are composed of people who believe that Bitcoin's original plan as laid out in the Bitcoin white paper is the correct plan for Bitcoin; meanwhile, a for-profit company backed by perhaps the world's most influential banking conglomerate has come in, declared the original plan to be unworkable, and proceeded to attempt to reengineer Bitcoin into something that most of us here consider an abomination.

In the meantime they have coopted r/bitcoin and other communications channels, heavily censored the sub, mercilessly banned anyone who disagreed with them, and promulgate disinformation to unsuspecting newcomers.  Some of them even tried to rewrite the white paper in situ.  You can get banned just for posting links to the white paper or for quoting Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin's creator.  In short, original Bitcoin got hijacked and ""jammed up.""

Today, we liberated it.  The revolution is still nascent, but today is a very important day in the history of cryptocurrency.  Today is the day that Bitcoin demonstrated its ability to resist capture and to innovate without permission. 

This is why we Bitcoin."
"The community has been deeply divided for several years now.  The number of transactions that could be confirmed was being artificially throttled, and the 'plan' to fix it would, by many accounts, make the problems much worse.

Because of the limitation, people had to pay higher fees to get their transactions confirmed, and while you could set your own fee, you needed to pay a high fee to ensure your transaction was processed (if the fee was too low, your transaction would fall off after a few days, but the recipient would be out of luck).  

This made bitcoin both expensive and unreliable as a payment method.  This is completely counter to the proposition under which it was created.

With the split, each side of the split can innovate on their own.  Many potential uses for bitcoin and the blockchain came to a halt or moved to other cryptocurrencies.  Merchant adoption had stopped or declined.

Hopefully those trends can reverse so that innovation and adoption can increase.  One side of the split will adopt uses that the other doesn't, and that is fine as long as consumers understand which coin they spend for which purpose.

I see this as a good thing and an ideal outcome, since there was not an acceptable compromise after many years."
It's not a good thing. Bcash  (doesn't deserve the Bitcoin name) is an altcoin and a scam. Right now it's in the pump jubilation phase and is being propped up by a small number of markets that haven't enabled proper flows of money....i.e. nobody can really sell much BCH yet. If any good can come from this, it'll be that real Bitcoiners may be able to sell some of this free money to obtain more bitcoin and the people in this sub will have fewer resources with which to continue their attacks.
"Correct.  Bigblockers are not opposed to L2; we're opposed to having *one particular implementation* of L2 (which still doesn't work as advertised) jammed down our throats while the original scaling plan is shit upon.

It isn't ""L1 or L2"" it's L1 AND L2, and not just one L2, but a free market of ideas innovating on top of Bitcoin."
That's true, although most big blockers prefer L2 later on, once BTC has scaled up to something more usable (3 transactions per second right now... Visa does thousands).
The Bitcoin QT wallet was changed to Bitcoin Core when the current Core team took over (a while ago, forget when exactly). There are alternative clients, but I'm not an expert on that - check the /r/btc stickies and sidebar.
The first block that belongs to the Bitcoin Cash chain, and is not shared with the Bitcoin Core chain.
As long as you hold the private key yourself, yup.
Depends on where it was. If it is a wallet in your control then yes. If at some exchange then you have to check because a few exchanges didn't give the bitcoin cash to the customers.
No. The competition is about getting users and miners on their side, not bitcoins. This post marks the separation of the two groups, beginning the competition.
There is no competition between the groups over which controls more Bitcoins.  There may eventually be 21 million Bitcoins of BOTH types, and creating coins of one type doesn't limit the number of coins of the other type that can exist.  The competition is for widespread adoption, not for the number of coins.  The mined block simply marks the first point at which the two Bitcoin networks actually split.

This sounds like an incredible moment then for the future of cryptocurrencies.  Thanks for the write up and articles!

"The Bitcoin project was largely co-opted by a group of people who believe that the best path to success for bitcoin is for it to be expensive, slow, and at full capacity. They say Bitcoin is digital gold, and gold is expensive to move around and is cumbersome, so if Bitcoin is those things it will be valuable like gold, too. The anonymous moderators of the original bitcoin subreddit (/r/bitcoin) support this viewpoint, but rather than allow debate and discussion they simply ban anyone who disagrees and delete all posts that argue to the contrary.

Somehow through their tactics and their media control, they've convinced a lot of people that their way is correct. Many (most) of the old school Bitcoiners bought into a vision of bitcoin as being a fast, inexpensive, and reliable global protocol. After years of in-fighting, enough people were finally fed up enough to spin off and create a competitor to the co-opted Bitcoin, but using Bitcoin's ledger state so that every person who owned Bitcoin (BTC) at the time of the fork owns an equal amount of Bitcoin Cash (BCC). This allows the two sides to trade against one another and let the best idea win in the marketplace.

My words may sound hyperbolic, but there's a lot of backstory and drama to all of this. Some recommended reading:

If you wait a while, you might be able to swap one for the other at similar prices.
Yet another stupid question: do we have another omni-cash and counterparty-cash layers with all -cash secondary coins on them?
This has to be the biggest block ever? right?
History!
But what is it trading at?
Who are currently the miners for BCH? Are any of the BCH miners also BCC miner?
The dev team behind bcash has been changing stuff right up to the lfork. Who knows how many bugs they introduced? They also should have changed the address version but didn't want to wait...what's the big rush? Nobody knows.
Agree, We'll just have to wait a couple days and see what happens
It's quite suspicious. Bcash is starting out quite centralized and is likely to become even moreso as blocks become full and fewer people can actually run nodes. What'll be really interesting is to learn the next step in terms of how bcash will upgrade, maybe to create more coins for some miners or to increase the blocksize again because reasons.
I'm sure he's furiously moving the goalposts right now.

***Behind on Bitcoin Drama? A (Short) History of Scaling by Lukovka in btc***

https://reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6o872y/behind_on_bitcoin_drama_a_short_history_of_scaling/dkg42ct/

scaling has been discussed since 2009 by Satoshi and others. It was always been clear that bitcoin would scale well enough to meet the expected demand, and that the 1 MB safety limit should be raised before it affected the operation of the network.

The Block Size War started in February 2013, when Core contributor Gregory Fulton Maxwell (/u/nullc) claimed that Satoshi's design was doomed and the salvation would be to switch to a radical redesign of his own.

Namely, Greg proposed to push all user payments to a completely different ""layer 2"" network (still to be designed), and restrict bitcoin to a vehicle for high-value ""settlements"" of the same. The capacity of bitcoin was to be intentionally restricted to be less than the demand, so those ""settlement"" payments would be forced to pay very high fees by means of a ""fee market"".

Gavin (the chief bitcoin developer at the time) and Mike Hearn rejected that plan, and insisted that the increase in the block size limit, that has been planned since 2010, was long overdue.

(Note: Both CEO and CTO of Blockstream never believed in Satoshi's vision of Bitcoin, they both ignored Satoshi in the beginning and only got back years later, with a grudge to turn Bitcoin into a bank puppet)

Wait, so this split is permanent? What does that mean for me when I want to buy bitcoins and to use them? Will I have to have two wallets because some merchants will use one fork and some the other? How about the bitcoins I buy for saving several years, how do I pick the right fork for that money? What about the bitcoins that were in people's wallets prior to the fork, can those be spent on both forks independently?
Such inflammatory language doesn't lend any credence to your argument, it just makes me want to think you're wrong.
What about R1, R2, L3 and R3?
Where's your L2 implementation? What's the plan folks.
I have it in a QR code made with mycelium wallet that has a code and check sum character. Does the bitcoin cash also use that same code/check sum?
You buy Bitcoin and then use it to buy Bitcoin cash just like any other altcoin.
"No. Not ""we"" or ""you"". I am talking about Greg specifically, and predicting that he will invent new reasons to attack the fork.

That is all. If you want to spin a narrative, do it elsewhere."
Well I want in on this shit. Good idea.
"> it's what I signed up for years ago when I got on the BTC train... one currency for everything

Unfortunately, BTC doesn't work for everything as transaction fees and transaction times are high. I have been forced to stop using BTC since transaction fees are a notable portion of the total transaction value."
Seriously, have you heard about Google? Try it and you will find a plethora of information. Also you might try the FAQ on this sub. 
"> I still cannot stuff 3.7mb of Bitcoin transactions into a Segwit block.

Yes you can.  They would have to 3.7mb worth of large 15-of-15 multisig txs, where 95% of the tx size is signature data (subject to witness discount), but you absolutely can do it.  It would probably be about 400 very large txs.  But my point is that those same 400 txs would take 4 blocks to get through without segwit.  So it still is a capacity increase over today.  [Here is an example](https://testnet.smartbit.com.au/block/00000000000016a805a7c5d27c3cc0ecb6d51372e15919dfb49d24bd56ae0a8b) on testnet of such a block."
"Some felt that Bitcoin should preserve its main distinguising characteristic in being decentralized and censorship resistant (why Wikileaks could use it when Paypal shut down their account) and the other side just wanted bigger blocks. If you ask me, the bigger block camp's real goal is to prune down the number of people who could run their own node and provide a check against the rest of the system. 

Bitcoiners are stubborn so didn't fall for it. The result, the big block camp seized on the well-known date of August 1st to introduce their fork. It's actually kind of a funny choice since August 1st first became a significant day by the UASF crowd that essentially wanted to force miners to do an upgrade they've been stalling on for a long time. At this point the main Bitcoin chain will be getting segwit in a few weeks opening the door to tons of improvements while this bcash stuff is a like a circus sideshow. 

Once the few exchanges that are trading bcash open up BCH deposits and BTC withdrawals we'll get an idea of the actual price of bcash but until that time, it's all kind of a dog and pony show."
I bet your modem blew up too.

"Oh man... 

If you are not trolling, just read pretty much anything in the past 3 years from r/btc and r/bitcoin reddits."
"One correction though: ""the other that adds functionality to move transactions off the blockchain"" (segwit) also allows more transactions to be processsed on the blockchain every ten minutes, fixes a bug called transaction malleability, and opens the door to MAST and Schnor which are worth reading about as ways to further scale Bitcoin."
"Yes, probably. Bitcoin cash honors the 478558 blocks that came before it. So if your bitcoins are stored in a wallet you control you can import that wallet into a btc client and spend them in a way that bch won't recognize as valid, and then you can import the same wallet into a bch client and spend them in a way that btc won't recognize as valid. (It's important to do it in that order.) 

As of right now BTC is holding around $2700, and BCH is climbing up to $700. This appears to be good for people who had Bitcoin on Monday. 

Edit: Most exchanges warned users that they would not pay out bch balances to users who stored their BTC on their service. This seems scummy to me, but the common wisdom since MtGox has been not to store your BTC on exchanges and they did provide weeks warning in most cases.   "
If you don't follow crypto stuff you just might not know. It isn't exactly headline news. If you are just some random person that has heard about bitcoin and wants to buy some, this is not going to be obvious. 
Hope there are many more like you, able to seek truth from facts and find happiness in anyones success. thanks
You're gonna install and support btc1 though, right?

This will undoubtedly be the name.
My bet is they had a lawyer look into this before hand, and now they can't get in trouble for it. 
"That's a bizarre reason.

So if the majority chain attacked BCC by sending 51% of combined total hashpower to mine empty blocks, thus erasing all BCC transactions - then it would become your preferred coin?"
"> I'm confused, do you think the Chinese firewall prevents the guys

No: I think the chinese firewall has a major impact on block propagation. Which is one of the main arguments against increasing the block size. With big blocks you are in a big advantage being in China (since most mining power is there), since it can take very long for blocks to propagate around."
$300 I think.
Forking away with new coin (totally optional) is not the same as safe (without chain split) hard fork execution in live network (when everyone needs to agree and upgrade). Though, I don't think this needs 6 months either. 
"Off topic, but Gavin said something a while back that puzzled me.

I asked him if he'd looked into other malleability fixes besides segwit, and he said something to the effect of ""segwit works, so I'm not motivated to look into alternatives"".

As a developer, segwit has always struck me as too clever and the people pushing it as too difficult to work with. If I had been in his position, I would have been looking at as many malleability fix alternatives as possible, so that I could find something to endorse instead of segwit."
"He's right, though.

It's a sad situation when the trolls are right."
Well, seems to be working great for marketing. People are advertising insanely high prices, when the reality is that you can't really sell it because there are no blocks, lol.

Second of all, major contentious issues don't come up all that frequently. They might come up more right now, because all cryptocurrency is experimental and developers are still figuring things out.

Third of all, if all cryptocurrencies were created from copies of bitcoin's ledger, that would only improve the value of bitcoin as an investment, because you could be assured that your value would be preserved through technological changes.

Forth of all, when cryptocurrency starts to be used for actual payments more than simply speculation, the useless branches will start dying off faster."

I think a lot of people are projecting their more advanced understanding of the situation onto the layman. These people wear snuggies, buy useless apps, and like simple things.

"> The problem is certain groups who try to mislead the community into thinking the protocol can't/shouldn't change or they all get to vote how it changes by what software they run.

That is part of the governance, it is self imposed by everyone on themselves. Everyone is trying to second guess what everyone else wants.

"Agreed, and I'd add that this separation of powers (for lack of a better term) means that the protocol takes time to evolve.

None of this means the protocol can't or shouldn't change, and anyone who says this is indeed misleading the community. But so are those who try to force changes without fully understanding them. "
It's possible. That's how it was proposed originally, in fact. It was only later that someone figured out how to do it as a soft fork.
"The problem is nobody can borrow and sell BCC, because nobody can move BCC.

This bcash community sounds great. I'm just an honest user trying to move my BCH like any other cryptocurrency, get a little pissed off because it is pain in the ass and slow, and now everyone is calling me an idiot :( I didn't know these transfers are supposed to take 10 hours.
Great analogy! I've heard that in order to be able to fully understand something you have to be able to explain it, so that goes to show how well you grasp the concept. Thanks for the clarification!
Public doesn't care about the longest chain.  They care about their transactions going through.
Selling it for real BTC.
But both chains won't use same difficult for long, the difficulty will go up and down. Why would chain length have any significance once there is a hard fork, so it's different chains? Hash rate matters. Btc miners could probably easily attack bcash at the moment. 
But based on how the difficulty adjustments work, isn't it almost impossible for BCH catching up to BTC's length?
Hashpower is what builds the chain. You have more hashes, your chain will be longer. 
This is what people mean when they say more hashpower, because this is the only way you can know anything about hashpower.
"If there are 2 different protocols that people generally consider ""bitcoin"", I'm very sure it is going to be a problem. No merchant wants the hassle of having a problem where customers sends you some altcoin you didn't except as a payment."

"ah...... they stopped because they lost 100 BTC they could've mined on the BTC chain....... *fuck* that's a lot of bitcoin.

So yeah at the moment BCH might as well be called ViaBTC coin then, and even then they're barely mining it. They really need the difficulty change."
That's the point. If they don't have any - by their logic, neither should either of us.

What is bcash?
[deleted]
Woohoo! Even better
The actual difficulty is easy to track.  It is straightforward.
You have to adjust for the actual difficulty on each chain post-fork.  If one chain is 5x longer post fork but is also 1/10th the difficulty of the other, then the shorter chain still has the most PoW.

">  The system is secure as long as honest nodes collectively control more CPU power than any cooperating group of attacker nodes.

His great vision of a useless chain that can be attacked at any time.

Indeed."
It's okay for people to have different opinions.
Hashpower follows price/difficulty ratio, not price. There's a difference
Aight, that's reasonable enough - carry on
They have a shared history and forked at the same height. The BTC chain is ahead as they have much more hash power and the same difficulty. Once BCH difficulty adjusts down sufficiently far, block times should be similar. If BCH can attract enough Miners due to ideology or economic value, then block times will speed up until the next adjustment. Simultaneously BTC block times would then slow down due to loss of hash power allowing BCH to catch up. 
"Rational miners follow price and difficulty. Which I agree, does tend to follow users - but not necessarily in a 1:1 relationship.

Miners will, if enough are rational, always follow the price:difficulty ratio between BTC and BCC"
"I agree that matters, but only above a certain minimum limit above which an attack becomes unviable.

BCH doesn't need more hashpower than BTC to be secure, it just needs enough to make a 51% attack economically unattractive/impossible. The same as BTC needs"
I'd argue miners can be as fickle as users - if their power consumption rises above profitability, they sell up. They have no attachment to the currency itself unless they are *also* a user.
I assume its petahashes not pico :p
"> I'd use the longest chain, assuming both chains use the same difficulty and hashing algorithms.

BCH contains new difficulty-lowering code changes to allow it to survive, which makes chain length / amount of work no longer directly comparable between the two. "
"> assuming both chains use the same difficulty and hashing algorithms.

BCH has a completely different difficult algorithm and that's why it is an altcoin. If it had the same difficulty adjustment algorithm, it would be a true fork and we could reach true consensus on which is ""bitcoin"" by the mechanisms described in the whitepaper. However, BCH was explicitly designed to survive without being the longest chain with the same rules, and that's why it will always be an altcoin."

">how can people even be pushed out

development is a group effort. by not involving people in the processes and ignoring/attacking their works it kicks them out of that project.   

not to mention the fact that no code will ever be merged without the approval the 5 gatekeepers. "
"Ok, well if that's the case then we need to reform the meta governance so that the community realizes that any cryptocurrency can split when there's significant contention, and that that's perfectly fine and that no chain automatically gets the canonical pre-split name.

I think cryptocurrency will show us all that splitting up is often superior to compromise."
"> And that the most important thing is making sure nobody loses any money due to a bug in the protocol.

The beautiful thing about splits like bitcoin cash, is now we get an experimental bitcoin and a ""safe"", proven bitcoin. If you don't sell either one, you'll be assured that you get the most advanced money and the most safe money."
"> It was only later that someone figured out how to do it as a soft fork.

That someone would be luke."
Indeed, but that doesn't seem particularly straightforward now that BCH uses two distinct difficulty adjustment mechanisms that work independently. 
Again sorry if this comes off stupid, but are we comparing the length of chains of BTC and BCH post-fork? And is the previous activity (pre-fork) stored in both chains? I read a few thinks yesterday saying that BTC's chain is already ahead of BCHs chain (which could obviously be false, bc Reddit), but how significant would this be in terms of BCH being able to catch back up and potentially have a longer chain.
Thanks man, that's a huge compliment for me 😊
Public will watch price/value is what I meant. And yes they want fast transactions and low fees. Frictionless cash. It all works together. 
They're talking about chain 'length' in terms of total work, so that blocks with a higher difficulty count for more than low difficulty blocks. This is how the client determines the longest chain, btw.
I'd imagine so, yes.  Unless there's a major disaster on the Bitcoin network, Bitcoin Cash will remain not-Bitcoin.
Yes.  The way to measure hashpower over time is the length of the chain, adjusting for difficulty.
"The longest chain is not synonymous with hashpower.  The longest chain is essentially the sum of all hashpower since the genesis block.  Hashpower is a (near-)instantaneous measure that could be more easily manipulated.

EDIT: Think of this analogy: Haspower:(difficulty-adjusted)Chain Length::Speed:Distance"
You have to adjust for difficulty (assuming it still uses SHA256 which it does).
The adjustment is different, but I believe you can still track what the actual difficulty of the chain is at any given moment in the same way you can with Bitcoin.  That makes it easy to compare the two.
why, because you haven't gotten verified with Kraken?

Well said. Everything is wildly speculative right now.
Well, a lot of small blockers just hold bitcoin, which to be fair is their primary use case. I think they are self-consistent. (But I disagree with them about the ultimate source of value in this technology.)
Yeah because it's extremely likely an experienced developer's finances are *that* transparent
The are so bad at bitcoin it is just comical at this point.
Incorrect.
How do you sell BCC now? could you please let me know?
"> So the stupid people are the ones who can sell at an over-inflated price, in your mind?

Yes.  Ever hear of MtGox?  Bitfinex?  BTC-e?  BS&T?  They all were either hacked, went backrupt, or were scams.  Everyone who left bitcoin on those exchanges lost everything.

So yes, I call people stupid who leave their money on exchanges.  In this particular instance, they lucked out, because they got to dump their BCH tokens for more bitcoin.  But it's not an ""if"", it's a ""when"".  If you hold your bitcoin on an exchange you will eventually lose it.

It's their attempt at a hostile rebrand of Bitcoin Cash.  It isn't working.
Roger Ver already busted a Core Dev once before over the fact that the he does less than 10 transactions a year in Bitcoin. It was that one debate that happened a few months back. I was kind of shocked that the people working on the software rarely use and utilize it. 
"> But you can literally borrow and sell BCC now for that current price (which was $717 when I typed the earlier message) and lock in your value, if you feel so strongly that it will plummet.

No, shorting is not the same thing as selling. With shorting you have to have collateral, and also because of short-term volatility you can get your short position force liquidated, even if the long-term trend is clearly downwards. Many people would be happy to sell, short-selling has very different characteristics and I would claim that it isn't suitable for most people."
HODL
Under the circumstances, that broker is a moron. Any sane professional would have responded 'which Bitcoin?'
It's not an opinion.  Bitcoin carried on just fine.  Your altcoin is dying.
No. I am verified with Kraken. Who is anyone?
"And the definition makes sense too, since proof of work and the chain are there to solve the problem of _distributed eventual agreement_.

That term is defined in the computer science research area of distributed systems and the goal is that the nodes of the system agree on one of the values of a non-compromised system or better yet on the value most of the non-compromised systems hold to be correct beforehand.

So agreement needs to be made between as many systems as possible and to make it more resistant to attacks we weigh powerful systems more highly. That directly correlates with chain length and so we accept the longest chain as the canonical agreed-upon value. So that's why that had to be the ""true"" bitcoin chain."
"If their power consumption rises above profitability that's a problem with the coin, not the miner. The whole concept of mining is driven by enlightened self-interest; they are rational economic actors. Their value being able to be withdrawn makes it no less concrete."

"Which part of ""valid point and challenge"" didn't you understand?"
"Yes we can compare any altcoin with Bitcoin. I don't get your point.

The change in the fundamental consensus mechanisms described in the whitepaper still makes this an altcoin and not a fork. If it was a fork, they wouldn't have had to make a new difficulty adjusting mechanism."
No, he's not right.  He's just a concern troll listing things that won't be issues soon or aren't really issues.
Where can you short bcc .. just curious as I didn't think one could anywhere yet?
"It is just plain way too early to say anything at all.  Sure there is some early results which are better than I would have thought.  But really, there is a tiny, very illiquid market at the moment with an atmosphere of emotion and agenda.  The ""value"" in that case is a ghost.  It is not coming from anywhere but a tiny, pressurized, easily potentially manipulated market.  Most people who entrusted deposits to ViaBTC, I would assume to be pro-BCH.  

Alot of exchanges aren't even trading BTC with all the potential forks happening simultaneously. 

Give it a few weeks.  We won't really know how the new networks behave until then."
"I've noticed this as a trend myself among all smallblockers, even to the point where when arguing they will admit if they had a substantial amount of BTC they too would want to see increased adoption and price.

If BCH's price doesn't fall over the next 15 days once they actually get enough time to move their money into exchanges and sell, the only conclusion I can draw is that the big blockers, like the miners, are heavily invested in and tied to Bitcoin and the small blockers are not."
[deleted]
which will be like, never. lol
Isn't Gavin CIA?
or bcash... As a bigblocker, I like it.
Yes lets all switch to BCH and get rich
"As a small block loving core supporting /r/bitcoin citizen, I agree with this message whole heartedly.

However, this goes both ways. So long as BTC hashpower > BCH hashpower, you need to stop trying to call it bitcoin, stop using their logo, and accept that you're an altcoin. We would."
"I mean.... viaBTC just cut 200pH of hash power and now 75% of mining is that weird ""Hennessy Road Wan Chai Hong Kong"" guy..... hash power is going down not up."
It won't happen, miners​ already lowering hash. Estimated lost since yesterday is over 100 Bitcoin.
"BCH

"The paper doesn't preclude changing the difficulty adjustment algorithm and still being able to call it ""Bitcoin"".  However, I don't understand what point you're trying to make.  ""Bitcoin Cash"" is not ""Bitcoin"", since it obviously does not have anywhere near the level of backing from miners that Bitcoin has.  *If* that changed, I would consider ""Bitcoin Cash"" to be ""Bitcoin"".  However, that hasn't happened.  So as I've already said, Bitcoin Cash is not Bitcoin."
"That doesn't make sense. Fortunately what Gavin says doesn't matter. Exchanges are already trading bcash with BCH symbol and the real Bitcoin is being traded with the BTC symbol.

Also, what are bitcoin cash accepting merchants going to do? ""Bitcoin accepted here - no, not that bitcoin but this bitcoin cash..."" This ""bitcoin cash"" brand is the lousiest thing ever. And have fun with that 15 hour block time."
Hashpower is irrelevant, what matters is the demand
chief scientist of bitcoin trash
I think the point Gavin is making is that he knows the argument has shifted to way from proposals so doing anything of the sort would be a waste of his and everyone else's time. Especially when he has been ridiculed on his other projects outside bitcoin by the people that pushed him out. Bitcoin needs to sort its governance out before it can sort out technical issues.

This.
"Low liquidity: A very small percentage of BCH is available to trade because most people either did not harvest their coins or do not have access to an exchange that trades it yet.

Also the transaction clearing times have been slow.

If there are 100 coins and only one is available on the market, and that one sells for $1000 then the market cap of the coin is $100 000.

Wait until more peolple figure out how to access their coins and gain access to exchanges where they can buy and selk them."
So how exactly do you track hashpower? Sorry for the extremely stupid question.
Never, then.
I can't use or sell it yet. Its value is meaningless.
What would be the point of that?

I would prefer cumulative hashpower as per definition but I guess if it happens at the instant hashpower then it's a matter of time.

Hell, Ver can even point his pool at BCC...

I'm not gonna hold my breath though. 
"
When Gavin endorses something it's instantly doomed. Rip BCC ! 
Reading his whole definition, he's also saying that BitcoinCash is not Bitcoin.  At least not right now.
"Heard of the ""flappening""? The ""plummeting"" is happening right now with BCH, so fasten your seatbelts for a hell of a ride downhill."
Me too, Gavin, me too. 
Well, at the moment it looks like BCH lost half of its hashpower today. https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin%20cash-hashrate.html
RogerVer wants to make BitcoinCash the FACEBOOK of digital money. Like Apple supports chinese censorship. Some People do everthing for money, spread fake news - and fool the people with lies
"Go Gavin!

Bet he ain't selling shit."
Why hashpower? That seems like an odd metric to use as it relies on a few thousand miners rather than millions of users
Right on
So I have all my bitcoin on a paper wallet. If I moved it right now using a bitcoin wallet app it would be stuck on the bitcoin blockchain and not usable on the BCC blockchain right?
I'm not sure how many of the blockstream people really hold bitcoin actually.
Except these splits also render both halves of the chain vulnerable to persistent reorganizations and loss of funds (if the split is 50/50) or outright attacks (if the split is 90/10).
Its only valued that way because most bcc holders cant sell theirs yet.  
If it's in paper wallet then you have an equal number of Bitcoin Cash. Fire up a Bitcoin Cash wallet and sweep the key to get access to it.
"> We would.

Greg and co literally shat their pants at the thought of forking to create their SegwitCoin because they wouldn't have the Bitcoin name that's the only thing that gives it any value.

Edit: not just that, but forking with all the hashpower and no alternative. A minority chain hardfork has happened with only some of the hashpower and the sky hasn't fallen. Does it make you slightly curious about where else they've been less than honest?"

I think the tweet was a sensible position. If BCH does indeed get the majority hash-power, block time won't be 15 hours anymore: they will be less than 10 minutes.
Merchant acceptance is a valid point and challenge. If the price is high enough I presume it is less of a problem. Alternatively you could just use lots to buy pizza.
You trolls don't even understand what Bitcoin is. 
"No, we can't compare any altcoin to Bitcoin.  We could only compare those that use SHA256 directly, and they would have to have a difficulty mechanism that would be easily comparable to that of Bitcoin.  Plus, there would be very point in doing so unless the altcoin in question uses the Bitcoin genesis block.

The blocksize cap is not a ""fundamental consensus mechanism"" described in the Bitcoin whitepaper and you may be surprised to learn that no specific difficulty adjustment algorithm is specified, either.  Regarding consensus rules, the paper states that, ""[miners] vote with their CPU power, expressing their acceptance of valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on them.  **Any needed rules and incentives** can be enforced with this consensus mechanism.""  You may want to re-read the whitepaper."
2 hour block time. Any merchant that accepts BTC can accept BCC with no issues. The vendors that manage these payment portals have little work to do to add it. Try harder and get a grip plz.

"Exactly!

"Bitcoin's governance works fine. Developers write code, miners choose which code is run, and nakamoto consensus determines how the protocol evolves.

The problem is certain groups who try to mislead the community into thinking the protocol can't/shouldn't change or they all get to vote how it changes by what software they run."
"You mean there is fake BTC circulating?  That sucks, another strike against that outdated trash.  

Your BCH doubled in value while you were sitting on your hands, so I guess you lucked out.  It's weird that you're still bitching so much."

I wasn't talking about blocksize.

> Regarding consensus rules, the paper states that, ""[miners] vote with their CPU power, expressing their acceptance of valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on them. Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism."" You may want to re-read the whitepaper.

This is exactly what I was talking about that was changed. The CPU Hashpower Vote he is talking about was enforced because if a true fork happened without the new fancy Bitcoin Cash difficulty adjusting mechanism, then the fork without enough hashrate for the preexisting difficulty would die and quickly become ""not the longest chain."" Bitcoin cash cares not that 95%+ of hashrate is behind Bitcoin. It cares not that it's the shorter chain. There is no ""vote"" happening. Both chains will continue to exist regardless.
"
Not sure that's possible? Segregated signatures isn't a super elegant or practical way to go about it either, so now that we're free from it, and we're clear that Txn malleability isn't really the impending doom issue it was made out to be, we can look far beyond SW towards a more comprehensive, simple, elegant, efficient, and extendable transaction format, which would look nothing like SW.
"""bcash"" troll. "
Users are exactly that: users. The value they bring to a coin is use and speculation. Miners invest their money in the hashpower that secures the coin. Their value is concrete.
"All the responses you get aren't exactly helpful so far so I'll do my best to explain.

On a blockchain you have to put computational work in to find a block, since the algorithm adjusts to factor in how much computing power is thrown at it the longest chain as in the number of blocks is not necessarily the longest chain by work.

You could view it as climbing up a hill on a bicycle. The longest chain it is not about the distance you have traveled, but the height you are. The difficulty algorithm tries to keep you moving horizontally at the same speed, so in this analogy the difficulty is the gradient of the slope. Currently Bitcoin Legacy and Bitcoin Cash are at the same height and on the same slope. Bitcoin legacy is currently steaming ahead that same slope, Bitcoin Cash struggling to maintain the same horizontal speed so the difficulty algorithm is flattening out the slope you on the bicycle meet the target speed.

In the future Bitcoin Cash may get to a slope in the future where it overtakes the Bitcoin legacy chain in absolute height. Only then can Bitcoin Cash claim that it has the most worked chain, thus ""longest"" chain.

Hope that helps."

"> Someone unleashed hidden value in Bitcoin, and HANDED you a chunk of value FOR FREE which is currently valued at $717 per BTC that you owned, you ungrateful a-holes.

That isn't even remotely true, since bcash isn't getting any blocks. By the time you dig your cold wallet, deposit the coins, wait for the 15hour blocks to confirm and are pressing the market order the market has probably already dumped.

Bcash is only high because those who hold bcash can't really move them."
There are four BCC dev teams. There will no longer be a 'core' team -- development itself is decentralized.
I call it bitcoin already -- it's the only one that is following Satoshi's vision
That's already the definition. Bitcoin is the chain with the most work on it.
Cumulative makes sense, longest chain and all that.   The Instant Hashpower will just be the tipping moment when BCC begins to make positive change towards becoming BTC.
"Hashpower calculators count the number of blocks created in a given time period. By taking account of difficulty (the slope according the excellent analogy by /u/2ndEntropy) they infer the total hashpower of a given network.

Sometimes miners get lucky finding a correct hash for a new block really quickly, sometimes it takes much longer. Because of this variance it's better to count the blocks over a longer period of time (e.g. 1000 blocks instead of 144 (144 is ~24 hours)).

nodecounter.com is one example where they show both timeframes.

ps it's a valid (& good) question!"
"you can infer hashpower based on time to generate a block and the difficulty.

"> Someone unleashed hidden value in Bitcoin, and HANDED you a chunk of value FOR FREE which is currently valued at $717 per BTC that you owned, you ungrateful a-holes.

Pearls before swine. If this isn't proof the universe has a sense of humor, I don't know what is."
That's not really up for debate.  It isn't bitcoin.  It's an insecure altcoin that hasn't had a block in 12 hours.
Hashpower follows price, which follows use.
The chain with the most hash power is Bitcoin by definition in the white paper.
"I'm guessing because rational miners should follow the users.

Users are their market. They can't make transaction fees without transactions. If/When it becomes apparent users are buying and using the miners will either follow or new miners will emerge as profit potential motivates. "
"Difficulty is a direct measurement of hash power (except when hash power suddenly changes as it did in the fork). As long as difficulty has enough time to stabilize after a change, it is designed to increase with hash power to keep the block time at an average of 10 minutes.

Once BCH difficulty drops at the next adjustment, we can probably view any passing of BTC difficulty by the BCH blockchain as overtaking it in hash power (neglecting unlikely extenuating circumstances like the hard fork that halves the BTC difficulty for some reason).

A better way to put it is if both chains are mining at roughly a block every 10 minutes, then the chain with higher difficulty has more hash power."
"If you have no hashpower, you have no chain. As a person with hashpower can come along, put everything you have worked on into the trash, and put his own blocks where yours were.

You know, a blockchain. But who cares about the fundamentals when you can talk about lies."
I wouldn't go with hashpower, personally, I'd use the longest chain, assuming both chains use the same difficulty and hashing algorithms.
I think the longest chain with most hashpower will ultimately become the highest price by a landslide. That is what the public will watch anyways. 
"That price is horseshit.  I'd gladly sell all my BCH for $717 a pop.  The problem is, I can't.  No one can.  No exchanges are realistically allowing BCH deposits.

The minute deposits are allowed, the price is going to plummit.  You can't just make a 10 billion dollar market out of thin air.  The price reflects an extremely small supply of BCH coins that are available only to people who were stupid enough to let an exchange hold their BTC for them."
"The $717 per BCH value is actually part of the problem.  At $30 I'd be happy to hold and see where it goes.  At $717, and unable to transact I'm on a sinking coin and want to dump and run while there is value.

When a coin is undervalued, I'm interested in buying and holding.  When a coin is overvalued, I want to collect that over-value."

He took $16M worth of funds for a project that delivered nothing. What else would you call that, besides fraud and theft? Honestly I don't really understand why Theymos hasn't been investigated by law enforcement for his role in the bitcointalk scam. Did he run a 501c-3? There's rules about that stuff.

I totally agree with you. /u/minerl8r was banned here also. All of reddit is censored. Theymos is one of the main censors who tries to silence viewpoints across platforms, and also is known to have taken money duplicitously and grossly missallocated it, to put it nicely. So we should definitely avoid his forum, because in that case at least, better alternatives exist, such as bitco.in. if you can point me to a better reddit alternative, I'll start using that too, but voat is just a reddit clone with shittier servers and steemit has problems all it's own.

"For a long time many people believed Karpeles was crooked but in the light of this new evidence it would seem Roger was right to think Karpeles wasn't a bad actor.

“We won’t beat around the bush with it: Vinnik is our chief suspect for involvement in the MtGox theft (or the laundering of the proceeds thereof). This is the result of years of patient work, and these findings were surely independently uncovered by other investigators as well,” the website says. “Everyone who worked on the case have patiently kept quiet while forwarding findings to law enforcement, so as not to tip suspects off and to maximize the chances of arrests.”*

"Roger actually did record a statement saying that Mark Karpeles showed him ""multiple bank statements, as well as letters from banks and lawyers"".

Sure, [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UP1YsMlrfF0) is from seven months before Mt.Gox's crash, but according to an [internal document from Mt.Gox](https://www.scribd.com/doc/209050732/MtGox-Situation-Crisis-Strategy-Draft) hackers had been skimming money from them undetected for *years*. So how would those bank statements have been true? Surely looking into it then would have raised some flags.

Not saying Roger for sure knew, but Mt.Gox should have known. I guess it's possible the bank statements, etc were falsified. But Roger sure did everyone a disservice by standing up for Mt.Gox."

The whole Theymos thing seems shady AF. But everyone's lack of objectivity and insistence to exaggerate are completely contradictory to their supposed 'moral high ground'. Because it seems they don't care about being honest as much as they care about badmouthing Theymos. Therefore I have little choice but to take what both sides of this argument with a pinch of salt. 

Also referencing 16million (as though the BTC was worth 16 million at the time) isn't a very honest or fair way of communicating your point. Hell, I've had disputes with people over very small amounts of bitcoins in the past (which, now, are worth *considerably* more).

I totally agree. It's a shithole that shut GCBU, one of the most popular threads ever since 2011 that still lived on. As the only one that ever talked to theymos, I really think he was bought out years ago. 
What is story/source on bilking 6k btc?
I joined bitcointalk in the very beginning. It changed a lot. Now, only scammers and trolls visit bitcointalk. Nice crowd that Theymos controlls there.
"The guys are actually working on it, although nobody has deployed it for Bitcoin. lol.

See: https://epochtalk.com/

The part I find absolutely hilarious: 

> Spend less time sifting through objectionable content

> Epochtalk’s powerful moderation tools help you manage objectionable content and problem users.

> You can setup rules to automatically check posts for objectionable content - and reject, edit or shadow delete them. Your rules can also be setup to ban problem users without lifting a finger.

> Let your community help moderate the forum by reporting problematic users and objectionable content. Epochtalk shows you a detailed view of all reports, with quick access to moderation actions on each user and post.

Literally one of their main talking points is how good it is at censorship."
I love how this hard fork is acting as a catalyst to wake up so many people who were not paying attention before. The old, corrupt regime must be shitting their collective pantaloons at all this exposure.
Also, theymos lost or sold the userdb many times.
"Jesus fucking christ, I didn't realize it was this bad:

<theymos> You must be naive if you think it'll have no effect. I've moderated forums since long before Bitcoin (some quite large), and I know how moderation affects people. Long-term, banning XT from /r/Bitcoin will hurt XT's chances to hijack Bitcoin. There's still a chance, but it's smaller. (This is improved by the simultaneous action on bitcointalk.org, bitcoin.it, and bitcoin.org)"
"> turn Bitcoin into a layer 2 settlement coin. They want to make people rely on liquidity providers that will be kyc and aml regulated. 

This are of course lies, because everyone can run Lighting Network node (the layer 2 scaling for Bitcoin).

This FUD you try to spread is just a projection - because it is your exiled developer Jeff Garzik who in fact DOES work on KYC/AML solutions.

And with your bigblocks, bankers are gods, and ALL TRANSACTIONS ARE VISIBLE ON CHAIN - much less private, and easier to censor.

Miners can censor on-chain transactions.

No one will be able to censor some of 2nd layer solutions (not all, but for example some 2nd layer blind signatures could be an option. No idea if this can be done in Lighting Network in particular).

Since this sub /r/btc massively censors - either just censors based on critiquing BCC, or just hopes on the posts-per-hour limit to stop people from repeating to same lie posted over and over by your troll-army (like this lie above) - I will rather continue to posts reply in other sub:

Bitcointalk is heavily censored by the powers that be who are helping theymos turn Bitcoin into a layer 2 settlement coin. They want to make people rely on liquidity providers that will be kyc and aml regulated. Layer 1 will be cost prohibitive for normal people to use.

"To be fair, notwithstanding how it was in the past, the bitcointalk forum is more tolerant of views that oppose Blockstream, Core, Digital Currency Group at the moment.

Exactly. How could they censor very much with the flood of messages being posted every day? OP is a bit disingenuous.

Everybody can run a lightning node but practically only liquidity providers with sufficient connections will be able to economically link up with other large liquidity providers to make lightning work at a practical level. And this will be a point of centralisation for kyc and aml regulations. Ordinary users will be forced to either link up with liquidity providers or deposit bitcoins with such liquidity providers because Adam Back wants to make layer 1 cost $100 per transaction.

Most of the time exchanges are the middlemen. But viabtc is the major backer/miner of BCC. So of course they want it to succeed, and that includes pumping up the price of BCC on its own exchange.

[deleted]
Without looking: HitBTC, Bittrex and Kraken are all **also** offering BCC to trade. I'm sure they are other exchanges I'm missing. So I guess you'll have to add them to your grand price fixing conspiracy. What you're saying doesn't make sense, I'm sorry, but it's clear you lack a basic understanding of how exchanges operate. 
"do any other exchanges have it yet?

edit:  https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin-cash/#markets"
I dont think it just appears.  I believe it takes some action on your part
Might have to sweep your private key(s) in a software that does work with BCC. Try finding their statement on the topic. Electrum said you should transfer your Bitcoin (core) to a new electrum adress from a new seed. And then use your old private key in another wallet to sweep the BCC/BCH. This way you split into the two coins. If you don't take action your software will only show Bitcoin (core)
It's more interesting to put volume next to it, as those price peaks can be a bit misleading in an illiquid market
Before the fork only viabtc and hitbtc were offering BCC for trading. And that's a different mechanism.
Does anyone know how to claim BCH on Quadrigacx?

You can indeed. Though, be careful as at 400 you may be buying in at a high.
Why hasn't the price of BTC gone down then? I was under the impression value will be split too.
Any hash power numbers yet? Interesting to watch this unfold today.
"It is a probabilistic thing.

If you expect that a transaction (or series of transactions) will make your blocks to take longer to propagate, you expect to be compensated for it. For example:

* Assume a miner estimates that a specific transaction will add a propagation delay of 30 seconds
* Given: 10 minute average block time, 12.5 BTC block reward
* The new transaction must pay at least 625mBTC (1/20 of block reward) to make the extra delay worth the risk.

Of course that example breaks down is the case of no block reward. In that case, each transaction is competing with the fees of every other transaction. Block times are still 10 minutes.

Also, 30 seconds may be high for a propagation delay. When I was mining P2Pool, I estimated my (slow) node took 13 seconds to validate/generate a new block*. This delay was not one of the directly observable stats on the P2Pool stats page.  IIRC I had my max block size set to 500kB, even though 1MB was allowed: I based that on my upload bandwidth.

*I recall accounting for the poor efficiency of my mining blade on P2Pool -- wrote that off as a pool donation."

Hash power is not the kind of resource you have to commit that way. Currently BCH miners are making something like 90% loss with their hash power compared if they would be mining traditional BTC. They can easily switch from one cryptocurrency to another - switching costs are low. So they can switch back to BCH when it becomes profitable. It simply doesn't make any economical sense to mine BCH currently, and I guess the miners are realizing that as the hash rate has been decreasing. Of course people can do it for ideological reasons...
Where can I see BHC hashrate?
"I came here from a thread discussing bitcoins on /r/games

Can someone break down what this seemingly monumental moment actually... means? Assume I have a basic understanding of bitcoins, mining and the blockchain, but nothing technical."
"no, it's not. Before the fork: 

* one user with *pre-fork* BTC wants to buy BCC

* another user with *pre-fork* BTC wants to sell BCC

again, as is with **all** exchanges, viaBTC only acts as a middleman. They will earn the same trading fees either way. I think you're confusing the viaBTC exchange with the viaBTC pool. They are separate, and the buying and selling BTC/BCC has nothing to do with the mining. "

No, because I'm not an emotional idiot. That would be in my opinion *illogical* - as in, it wouldn't make logical sense, but I wouldn't be unhappy with it. 

This is the problem with your argument. It's irrational. That's not to say that the folks *insisting* Bitcoin Cash is called bcash are rational either, though. Consensus decides a name like this. Nobody owns it.

"Can I call bcash ""His perfect highness Satoshi's holy vision of money conceived in 2008 and never subject to change based on evolving knowledge""?"
Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin has split in two. Bitcoin Segwit2x hijacker coins, and Bitcoin Cash which is what Bitcoin was always supposed to be before psychopaths took about a couple years back. Simple as that. Bitcoin Cash currently has lower price and that is fine. Considering I bought Bitcoin at $8 in May 2011... and then $2 in Nov 2011... I might have far more than you imagine.

There was no lie. I bought at $8. I spent an entire day reading about Bitcoin and then wired my money immediately. Unlike some people who seem to literally take months or years to get involved I was involved pretty much instantly. I rode the first big rally to $32... and then the bear market down to the $2 zone... at which point I bought more than most people can imagine. Lately... I've felt Ethereum has a better chance of continuing the blockchain dream since the Usurper Core hijackers and Theymos censorship fucked Bitcoin up quite successfully.... meanwhile Ethereum has exploded in marketcap and international business support... while Bitcoin has shit in comparison. The recent Segwit2x and Bitcoin Cash have both given me renewed hope for Bitcoin, but I'm not entirely convinced yet. I care more about crypto and blockchain technology in general than any Bitcoin Maximalist stupidity.

Hmm. You're seriously stretching the definition of 'consensus' there. Most people haven't known about it for more than a few weeks. As a currency and a concept Bitcoin Cash is too new for a decent consensus to even exist.

>  There is a second, smaller group of people trying to change this with ulterior motives.

No, there's a larger group of people (which I'd consider myself to be part of) that are rising above all of the bullshit of /r/btc and /r/bitcoin and are letting a small minority on both sides fight it out. Either way, no overwhelming mainstream consensus yet.

I know you mean well but I think both sides are stuck in echo chambers. Bcash as a name will never work if nobody wants it, but conversely Bitcoin Cash as a name won't work with this much friction and apathy. Compromise will be needed by both sides if both coins are to be successful and adopted in a widespread and mainstream way."
None of those are social attacks though, because they haven't started to catch on anywhere, which is an important difference.

They've been supporting hijackers of Bitcoin and happily letting themselves be censored and controlled for years. Low information users don't get to define something they aren't even part of... that actually follows Satoshi Nakamotos vision far more accurately than the corrupted stolen Segwitcoin. 
Sunlight is the best disinfectant. Stupid ideas are best defeated by valid criticism.
"You are free to downvote everyone using ""bcash"" instead of ""Bitcoin Cash"", aren't you?"
"You know some of us just happen to have different opinions than you on some stuff. This is the uncensored free and open sub right?

The second you start tagging people (like me) who disagree with your opinion, then you're no better than those you oppose in the first place. 

I'm not here ""attacking"" the sub, you can make statements, but it doesn't make them facts. You can repeat your statements, but they are still not facts.  If I disagree with your opinion (as I do on this matter) then I will tell you you're wrong. "
I have talked to you before actually. Might even talk to you on Mumble later!
">Consensus decides a name like this.

It has been decided already by consensus. There is a second, smaller group of people trying to change this with ulterior motives. 

There is a lot to a name. That's why some domain names are more valuable. That's why some sub-reddit names are better than others. It's a PR world. Names go a very long way. 

And those trying to take the ""Bitcoin"" out of ""Bitcoin Cash"" know precisely that. If you can't see that then you are blind or intentionally trying not to see it."

"> Less than 6 blocks per hour = No market.

No, that's with the current difficulty imported over from the original chain, which will change soon.

> Heck, even the shittiest altcoins have more hashing power than this experiment.

You know nothing about current hashpower, much less about even near future hashpower that will be attracted once the difficulty adjusts."
so, markets decided bcash is the name for Bitcoin Cash? well, can you list a few...?
Wha's your proof?
That's ok for you. It seems though that your very first contribution to the topic of Bitcoin on Reddit has been to say that you prefer this name.
I agree it's just marketing. Bitcoin Next or Bitcoin FE (Founders Edition) or something else would be consistent with what it's supposed to be. 
"start by calling it Bitcoin Cash or ""Bitcoin Cash as written on Satoshi's White Paper"".

maybe they'll unthrottle us."
"You say this... yet I almost certainly own more bcash then you.

Market will decide. I mean, it already has decided which is bitcoin and which is the altcoin.

Satoshi's vision was for the longest/most-work chain to always be the mining tip. Bcash violates this very base fact that defines bitcoin."
Trolls are best defeated by ignoring them. Failing that, and yes, we will fail that, troll flairs are a pretty good idea.
Also, bleach
"Pushing ""bcash"" is an orchestrated attack on bitcoin cash's branding, not a ""different opinion.""  Take your lies elsewhere."
Yes, you should always be allowed to expose your downvoted BS to our voters. 
"It is the free and open sub, yes. 

Simply tagging you as an enemy to Satoshi's Bitcoin isn't the same as banning you, like many were from /r/pyongyang. 

You can make statements all you want. You just did. Now I'm making statements. Look at us having a really fun discussion. You can make your own statements, which as you point out, are not facts. Wow, a real discussion. Look at us. 

Here are some statements for you: **Blockstream is an in-the-open, corporate-funded _terrorist operation_ set out to cripple Bitcoin with poison-pill code, destroy the community through trolling and in-fighting, and try to reverse the most important invention since the internet itself.** 

But I'm _allowed to say that here_. That would undoubtedly get me banned in /r/pyongyang. It would get you banned there too. You're not banned here. You've just got ... unpopular statements.  "
"I might call it something else... but I agree that I'm dropping ""cash"" the second Bitcoin Cash gets more traction. 

It is _the_ Bitcoin. "

"Given this forum calls Bitcoin Core ""Blockstream Core"", what did you expect?"
"Why are you mentioning ""BCC"" as a viable term in your OP also?  They're using this wrong phrase in hopes that people will confuse it with BitConnect (BCC) an existing alt coin. Same thing.  

BCH is the only correct way to reference it. "

"You have ""Bitcoin Kore"", ""Blockstream Core"", ""Segwitcoin"" etc. commonly used in here. How come you don't mention any of that?"
"""bcash is racist"", LOL."
"The next most popular post on /r/btc at the time of leaving this comment includes a screenshot of an exchange calling it bcash.

I agree that people shouldn't throw your fork under the bus, but your post starts right out the gate with a provably incorrect statement. Ya'll gotta get better about the difference between ""mostly true"" and ""true""."
Everyone on all sides of this argument puts way too much stock into Reddit talk. For years everyone has accused everyone of being a hack and a Schill. Do you know how pointless and valueless it makes all CC look?  A few trolls can sabotage an entire coin or block chain ??  If anyone is taking financial advice from random Reddit users they are already a fool 
"This may be true, I don't know. But from my perspective, it just makes sense to call it Bcash. With two coins, one has to be Bitcoin or I think BOTH sides lose a lot. If we have two Bitcoins, we've doubled the amount of Bitcoins out there. It makes it really confusing for new users. If your tech really is superior, people should see that regardless of your name, so what's the issue?


p.s. I'm not a troll and I'm commenting on behalf of only myself, you can look at my comment history and I'm sure you'll see. Even if there is a ""social attack"" perpetrated by some, I think there are also a significant group of people who just want to make the fork go more smoothly and think that calling your chain Bcash would help with that. Just my two sense--not trying to start a fight just interested in discussion!"
Guess someone should have trademarked it.
"Nope. It's called ""bitcoin"". Core / segwit BS coin is now ""witcoin""."
"It is not an attack when the majority decides it is bcash.

Is bcash  a centralized entity?"

"~~You~~ They don't get to complain at people to 'fork-off' and then get to change the name of the fork. This behaviour is plainly ridiculous and a continuation of bad behaviour and censorship-led influence that has plagued the bitcoin community on reddit for too long now. Unfortunately I knew the behaviour would follow the fork.

spez for clarity"
I don't understand why this upsets you so much. What's wrong with the name Bcash?
"I guess we should start referring to Ethereum Classic as ""eclassic"" now /s"
Then what does BCH stand for, if not BCasH?
"Welcome to the altcoin club. Bcash is an altcoin and a bad one. Look at the current blocks being (not) mined.. If you wanted to create an altcoin, how can you name it bcash. Come up with something original please. 

I don't hold bcash nor Bitcoin. However it's kinda silly to think you are not just another altcoin. "
We should call btc - Bitcoin Classic - for some extra confusion
Bitcoin Cash is a really annoying name. I am unbiased, and don't care which fork succeeds, but I automatically found myself referring to it as BCH as soon as I saw it, or bcash, simply because they are easier to say, and is the smallest most impactful morpheme
I think bcash has bigger problems to solve than its name :-)
Bcash is faster and less deceiving.
"We call US Dollars ""bucks"".
We call British Pounds ""quids"". 
Why we cannot call Bitcoin Cash ""Bcash""?"
"Your comment attempts to sound unbaised but I don't believe it.

To prove it, what if I said that Bitcoin should change it's name to Bcoin? Would you be unhappy with that? Why? Same answer applies to Bitcoin Cash.

Your post is another attempt to water down the Bitcoin Cash chain.

Sorry, but that's what I see."
Ya'll are too paranoid. I'm a fan of larger blocks and I love bcash because it feels like it's super cypherpunk and is unambiguous. Bitcoin cash is too long and confusing
"Here is more proof of shills pushing to change the name: https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6o60wd/honest_suggestion_call_the_new_chain_bitcash/

Its quite pathetic, it shows that we are winning."
Its called B Cash to avoid potential confusion with Bitcoin my dudes
BCash is more suiting, Bitcoin Cash just rides on the notoriety of the Bitcoin brand. It's like Pepsi branding itself Coca Cola Drink.
"Honest questions: who decides the fork name, developers of the fork? Financial backers? Supporting miners?

Also, ""Bcash"" is derogatory? What makes this an attack? Is it just an unwanted nickname, like a Richard being known as Dick?

I have noticed no exchanges use it, and only a small list of companies using Bcash in an official capacity, or at most mention it as an alternate name (similar to how some refer to Bitcoin as BTC)
"
I honestly dont care what we or they call it. 
"> No exchange or software uses the incorrect name ""bcash""

Not saying it's a good name, but Bitfinex seems to be using it in some spots: https://i.imgur.com/DYOMGQN.png https://i.imgur.com/DFjdg8h.png

Even the URL itself uses it: `https://www.bitfinex.com/withdraw/new/bcash`"
"Proper website is bitcoincash.org, proper subreddit is /r/bitcoincash.

/r/bcash is a scam subreddit anyway. Just do enough PSAs so people don't mistake that for genuine thing. Also bcash.io website is a scam too.

As I said in other threads, BCash doesn't exist at all, anyone can create an altcoin and name it so (as in: BCash). Because BCash is NOT Bitcoin Cash and never was.

Edit: being downvoted by /r/bitcoin shills. Yay."
Need your help to build more awareness around Bitcoin Cash on social (Youtube). Help me raise the awareness by checking it out. https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6r52e7/produced_a_video_to_separate_bitcoin_cash_from/
I like BCash
The thing is, it's actually a pretty good name. 
"Fuckin a right, I said the same thing basically yesterday to some folks.

https://bitcoincore.slackarchive.io/debate/page-99/ts-1501625287396042"
bcash is called whatever people want to call it, you can't decide for people, dufus.
Actually I think BCash is a perfect name. We can start standardizing the chain names as BSegwit and BCash. They are all Bitcoin, just different forks.
Censorship on this sub is already active... My link to this post which reach the top post on r/bcash were removed in less than one hour.
Why not bitcoin cash lover as flair?
This is a fantastic idea!!
What do I get if I call it a scam coin? Because thats what I call it. 
"Sorry OP, but I disagree.

I am on neither side of the fence here (and I feel any rational person who understands that human tribalism is a flaw should feel the same) - I follow /r/btc and /r/bitcoin. I now hold BTC and BCH as well as others, and I'm planning on holding all for a long time to come.

Whichever 'side' 'wins', so be it. It makes no odds to me - it's the future and progress of some sort is inevitable. Bigger blocks or SegWit. Maybe neither side will win outright and both will grow stronger over time.

But anyway, back to the point, to call BCH 'Bitcoin Cash' and BTC 'Bitcoin' doesn't some across as a great idea. It's going to be confusing for noobs and whilst you may consider that an irrelevance you have got to acknowledge the bigger picture here. Cryptos are/will be/should be the future but they need to be made as accessible and understandable to the general public as possible.

At the end of the day, why be so tribal and obstinate about the name? Bcash works well. It ticks all the branding boxes. It's a good name, easy to remember and the word 'cash' is descriptive whilst the 'B' denotes its origin.

I mean, fuck, we *could* rename Bitcoin-proper, but that seems like the less logical solution, by far, just to appease a vocal minority.

IF (big if) BCH becomes larger than BTC there would be a case for calling BCH 'Bitcoin', but it's simply too early to have that conversation. For now, BCH is the lesser of the two simply due to its age and lack of popular support at the present time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Edited to add**: I love the name 'Bitcash' as proposed by /u/ImWithHearse/ - the more I think about it, the more I think what a good compromise it is."
"The reason ""Bitcoin Cash"" is less confusing than ""Bcash"" is because it makes clear that it's a variant of Bitcoin. If a tell a newb about ""Bcash"", then sure, he's unlikely to confuse it with the other Bitcoin chain, but he's also unlikely to realize that the new chain has the same ledger history and almost the same rules as the other Bitcoin chain, and that it's supporters believe it will be considered simply ""Bitcoin"" in the future.

The thing is, cryptocurrency forks are inherently confusing to most people. You can try to hide this fact by naming things in a way where people don't have to think about forks, but then you just give them a worse set of misconceptions about what's actually going on. "
I agree with /u/Vibr8gKiwi as usual!
"/u/bashco 

/u/theymos

/u/qubeqube"
Look at it the other way around. You could ICO a token called bcash and let BSers drive users to you.
Thank you for the clear, short and well cited post!
Thanks buddy. It seems like every step of the way the r\/bitcoin & Blockstream wolves are at our throats. Gotta keep the true information out there.
"Fight bad speech not with censorship but with more speech.  Give a special flair to anyone using ""bcash"" in a way to normalize it.  Flair could be ""known troll"" or something."
"So according to your logic Bitfinex is run by /r/bitcoin?
https://www.bitfinex.com/deposits/new/bcash"
Oh dear. This is such a poisonous path you are recommending. Better to stay calm and respond with polite but reasoned argument.
We don't do troll flairs. 
I support this... there is no bcash. It doesn't exist for anyone but people trying to alter the narrative and destroy Bitcoin Cash, the original, true Bitcoin without Usurper Core hijacker control. 
Really good idea.

Can we call it Bitcoin Classic instead? I'm going to. Fuck you.
"My eyes hurt from seeing three cunts tagged in a row. 

I actually sit in the Dragons Den mumble and listen to them perpetuate bullshit. It's hilarious to listen to. Ping me if you want their mumble info."
Or another idea, albeit a stupid one: do yet another fork of Bitcoin, officially label it Bcash, and profit from trolls' free advertisement.
