Question: What impact would $1B of tether going to zero have on a crypto-market with a $400B+ market cap? How could it possibly cause a crash?

"Do you guys remember a few months ago when alts followed btc? When btc surged in USD value, alts would actually go up on the ratio. Presumably because people were buying into btc to buy alts, causing an upwards rally.

That seemed to change a few months ago, and now we always have the inverse relation ship of bitcoin up, everything else down.

Well, what exactly has changed since then? Take a look at tether's cmc. Theres a very definite point where the marketcap skyrocketed. That's when they first started to get printed at rapid rates, just around the same time we saw a reversal in the bitcoin-altcoin trend. While people before were buying into bitcoin as their gateway to buy more alts, a lot of the money flowing into bitcoin now might just be bitfinex throwing tethers at it, explaining why none of it is flowing into alts.  "
"What you say is correct, but OP is not saying ANY of that.  We already know it has no backing.  OP is just showing that Tethers are moving between exchanges and for some reason that means Bitfinex owns it all?

He said nothing about having no backing."
~$5000 is a pretty big correction.
I agree tethers are probably illegal and a scam.  But what OP is saying is just baseless and his claims are also totally vague despite him saying he's made it clear several times.  He's basically just shown that tethers are moving between exchanges that use tethers.  
or you can use it to send 5x $1 transactions with $19 fees, so $100 = $5.
"The only people who need to run full nodes are miners and exchanges, for users SPV has the same security. Even if it takes 10'000$ to run a node, that's pocket money to those people.

And it's all useless if people are forced to a second layer which is basically a rediscover of the banking system with its centralized points of failure and ability for governments to control it. Bitcoin is only valuable if all layers are decently decentralized, if someone can be excluded from using layer 2, then it's automatically excluded from Bitcoin due to prohibitive fees. Some exceptions could be made for <1$ transactions, but the vast majority of commerce must be decentralized."
It is amazing that is considered a low fee.
"ETH just upped theirs because the kitties were getting feisty. Took the miners a couple hours of deliberation and they have a mechanism to do it without a software update. The rumors of the kitties ""bringing ETH to its knees"" were highly exaggerated. The transaction fees began to rise because the blocks were full so they made the blocks bigger before the fees got much higher. It did not take them 3 years of shit flinging, massive marketing campaigns, a contentious fork and the destruction of what was once a really cool community to be a part of because some kitties were filling up blocks; they just fixed the problem. It's amazing how simple it really is."
It's a rare metal with metal-like properties. Very useful in it's niches.

Median fee has gone downsignificantly from 200+ sats/byte to 100-140 sats/byte range, sometimes as low as 70 sats/byte."
Since BTC has the most public awareness, if it ever fails due to Core mismanagement it sets back public adoption of all cryptocurrencies by years, and that's lame.
I'd rather have a coin that can be used by 6 billion people than one that can only be used by a few million whales.
"Actually I'd say it's your response that doesn't look serious. ""Increasing block size is not scaling""? Actually it's the only thing that IS scaling.

I actually like much of your post here, but I don't like that you referred to OP as childish, and I think you misrepresented his post.  I can't speak for him, but speaking for myself, I have absolutely no disdain for BTC, and I still hold both BTC and BCH from the HF.  [Edit: I am also happy that the BTC price is doing very well]. What I do have disdain for are certain BTC core developers who years ago agreed we needed on-chain scaling, but who changed their minds once they founded Blockstream, and who now have said there is no inherent problem with high fees, even if fees were to go higher than $100 per tx.  That by the way would be far higher than any bank fees for int'l wire transfers.  The conflict of interest of some of the key core developers is obvious.  Blockstream wants to keep the tiny 1 MB block-size limit so that BTC users will eventually be forced to use their LN side-chain, which will increase their profits in the coming years.  
I send intl wires for my business but always send in dollars and never pay a penny in fees. But then again I still wish I could pay my suppliers in crypto.
Not true, among others Kraken and Bitfinex offer BCH/USD
A temporary fix is more than BTC has.
I do realize that. And I'm perfectly happy with looking at solutions as we run in to problems. I also realize those solutions will never be a Lightning Network, preventing the comeback of the middlemen. BTC is Revenge of the Banker, trying to screw us for because we're  trying to cut the leeching off.
Wait a minute, are you saying BCH is unreliable because of fluctuations and implying BTC doesn't fluctuate that much? Are you retarded? Were you living on a different planet the past few days?
Quick downvote this man his reasoning is way too intelligent.
My Bitcoin never fluctuates. 1 Bitcoin remains 1 Bitcoin. That crazy volatile USD on the other hand... They have crashed hard this year though, losing over 95% of their value so they may not be around much longer.
"There's no ""fluctuation"" with 0-conf transactions, also you have way less fluctuation in 10 minutes with BCH than in X hours with BTC.

Additionally you can choose to cash out when the fluctuation is in your favor if you can affort do wait a bit..."

"Racial tensions have remained pretty much the same since at least Obama's election. Record numbers of alcoholism is related to the lack of economic certainty and loneliness. However the economic outlook has greatly improved in the past year or so. North korea is saber rattling but they have done this for decades. 

US internal political strife is on par with what it was during the Obama administration. The only difference is that now that the democrats feel uncertainty, But this happens every time the other party takes power. If we look back on Obama the Republicans felt as much uncertainty and fear. 

The problem is both sides have greatly different goals and their usual main goals is to undo the other sides achievements. And finally their has not be trust in Americas institutions for decades, Since 1994 the confidence rate has never surpassed 43% and 
in the past decade has never surpassed 36% percent and currently its at 35%.

It’s a total regression and a failure to add a 3rd party to make it work again.

">  We'd best keep working on them, then,

Unfortunately the problem is more fundamental than that.  When you move transactions onto a ""second layer,"" you have, by definition, added a layer of risk. And that risk increases the more the main chain is artificially constrained -- the smaller your ""base,"" the more precarious the structures built on top of it.

>the technology to allow orders of magnitude more users on chain without sacrificing user autonomy doesn't exist either.

Bitcoin was created in '08, around the time of the financial crash, an incredible stressful time, it died down, and now it's picking up because we are in really stressful times- record numbers of alcoholics, people die by the thousands on a daily basis, there is widespread corruption in government, racial tension, threat of nuclear war, the list goes on and on. I think Crypto dies down in 4 years if we start to see more confidence in America and its institutions.

We are trying to make serious discussions here, your answer does not look like one.
"Sure we need to increase block size on Bitcoin as well, but it is not a definitive scaling method and by doing it without maximum cautious would destroy decentralization.
I am not saying that increasing block size is a bad thing, it's something that we must do actually, but is not a fix, is not a way to scale bitcoin to world-wide and we need to be extremely cautious with it, to avoid centralizing bitcoin, by making running full nodes a very hard thing (just google, or do yourself the math, any calculation on the bandwidth and space needed to keep a full node with different block sizes, ex. https://iancoleman.io/blocksize/)
Creating additional layers, such as LN, will *NOT* make bitcoin centralized, because the layer one will stay decentralized, which is the most important issue here.
Like internet I think the way to go is to use bitcoin and create additional layers build upon it (ex. Bitcoin should become the ""IP"", LN or any layer 2 technology would be the ""TCP"" and so on)."
That's true my friend. But most people here think that block increase is the solution to all evil :).
"1. I'm telling the truth. You could simply look at other transactions of similiar size and fee and see how long they took. You won't, because you have clearly chosen your side and are happy to sling mud at anyone who isn't on it. I prefer not to post my BTC transaction IDs here, its a security and privacy risk. If I was spreading FUD it would be easy to prove me wrong using similiar transactions from the 24 hours before I made my post. Please go give it a shot if you want to start calling me names, then at least you have earnt the right and I have earned the pleasure.   
    
    

2. I am for increasing the blocksize. But, only as a temporary patch. I do not mean to decrease the blocksize afterwards, but as a stop-gap until 2nd layer solutions are built (I know, burn me on the stake). Clearly if BTC keeps growing then we cannot keep doubling the blocksize indefinitely without compromising decentralisation of nodes. You understand how decentralisation of nodes is important, right?       

My stance in a nutshell:  

I want lower fees for end users (on chain fees can stay high if they need to, if offchain is avail and low fees)  
I want 2mb blocks very soon (but its probably best to implement LN first)  

2nd layer solutions do not remove security from the blockchain when done right.      
I do not like Bitcoin cash, mainly because there should be a distance between miners and devs to keep game theory fundamentals applied  

Im not picking sides, you should be careful who you pledge allegiance to too...

The dream of the original white paper is not lost... it’s just going to be fulfilled be another coin. It might even be a coin that is not in existence yet. It doesn’t matter which one it is. BTC is kicking down the door for other coins to walk through.... all you “principal” people should be happy about taht

Because it has a incredibly lower volume and a temporary fix of bigger blocks? can you understand that's not a real scaling feature but just a temporary fix?
"I agree. Dash had a vote with its 2k nodes on whther to increase blocksize from 1mb to 2mb or no.  
All but 18 nodes voted *yes*  
If 2mb is supposedly a big problem for nodes, then why wasnt it a problem for Dash nodes?   
A 2mb blockchain now would be a good patch and apparently not a notable loss in terms of centralisation.

Two more new points I hadn't thought of, nice. It goes to show how kneejerkily tribal this switch to the store of value narrative has been. No thought process sought, none taken. Just fall in line with Core BS.
Not exactly true. Mempool size is a variable in the config file and if I choose to I can rebroadcast your transmission indefinitely if I wanted.
"It would be unwise to use any address for which you don’t have the private key in the long term. Bittrex might not exist at all “years later”. It’s a fine way to accept a one-off btc payment though.

I always imagine one day I’ll receive a message saying “hey I just sent an expensive gift to the one-off address you gave me four years ago” and I’ll kick myself for not hoarding my private keys but it’ll never happen. People check with you before sending any significant amount to an address you used to use. "
Uhh yea because the meme pool getting fuller and fuller for years now, with no end in sight since lighting is always “18 months away” is us being impatient.
Bittrex does keep old addresses for your account, but you should always check before getting a payment.
Coinbase (#1 in the U.S) does no sell it and Gemini (#2 in the U.S) does not sell it as well. 
"The foreign transaction fee is going to depend on the credit card company. It's another fee that a lot of people get surprised by when they use coinbase. 

It's a good move to move him to an exchange as opposed to coinbase even if they start offering bch. At least, with the gdax method he won't have to keep using his credit card to try to buy more btc to try and cover the fees of getting out."
"I haven't had any issues sending btc, eth, or ltc through gdax to different exchanges/wallets, and hadn't been charged additional fees so the process of sending your coins over to your bitpay wallet is free. After that you'll be subject to whatever fees bitpay charges.

The key is to do everything through gdax if you want the purchasing and withdrawal of crypto to have no fees. Here's a [drawing of what I described from another redditor](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6xa6u2/coinbasegdax_to_wallets_fee_efficiency_map_hope/)

Without sellers no one can buy. And without buyers, the price cannot go up.
”Bitcoin’s usefulness as a store of value comes as a secondary effect from its usefulness as a medium of exchange. If you destroy the medium of exchange, you destroy the store of value.”

Because most of these idiots got suckered and manipulated into buying a shit load of bitcoin cash during the pump and dump flippening and now they are extremely butt hurt at the rise in price of core. They refuse to admit Bcash is a fraud with heavy flaws in its code and lightning is coming. 
"Even if fees and transaction times go down, the implementation of Lightning, especially if done poorly, can result in effective bank/government ownership of the coins payment channels. That's the real issue here imo.

If Lightning gets fully implemented for the public, I'll be super thrilled considering the mess we're currently in. That doesn't mean I'm not equally or more into Bitcoin Cash though."
Looks like you still need the /s for that one.
No one should ever send money to an address they have not just confirmed is still valid, so that doesn't really matter. Would you send a bank wire to someone 10 years after you sent the first one without confirming they still have the same account at that bank?

Quite true, yes. Especially present with BTC due to it's popularity maybe, but certainly cryptos in general. 
That's true, while there are probably some big players that aim to pump the price while selling their BTC to small people buying in, there is no central authority that can run with the money.
You can believe in a company and invest and see the asset grow just like you can believe in btc. It's not rocket science, just look at the fundamentals of the company and decide if you think they make decisions that make money.
No, if you buy a share of a company, then that company's profits are divided up and given to shareholders. Yes, if the company is successful then the demand for those shares goes up. But the company is useful and it's the utility that gives the shares value. If the company does badly, the price drops.

"Well I haven't really argued for an unlimited blocksize.  I've simply argued that if we *are* going to have a constraining block size limit, we need to be damn sure that it's not set too small. 

But in general, I don’t think that block size should be a “consensus” parameter. In other words, I don’t think it makes sense to threaten to split from the majority hash rate chain over block size.  (Side note: if you haven’t already, you should really read this excellent article: The Market For Consensus: https://medium.com/@Mengerian/the-market-for-consensus-203de92ed844)
 
Instead, the enforcement of any “block size limit” should be, at most, provisional. This is why I think Bitcoin Unlimited’s treatment of block size was correct (at least at a philosophical level).
 
When you run BU with an EB setting of X and a reasonable, finite AD setting, you're not really treating ""excessive"" blocks as ""invalid."" Your enforcement of that limit is expressly provisional. You're basically saying: ""I'll defer acceptance of blocks larger than X because I predict that's what the network as a whole will do at this time. But I could be wrong, and I'll ultimately follow whichever chain proves to be the longest. I'm certainly not willing to permanently fork myself off onto a minority chain over block size. That would be crazy.""
 
Second, I don’t think any block size limit should be a binding economic constraint.  If the network is going to enforce a limit, it should be--certainly at least for the foreseeable future--the kind of limit that the 1-MB limit was for the first six or so years of its existence: an in-the-background parameter that was set comfortably above the natural equilibrium block size, such that it had no real impact on the network’s day-to-day operation.

Having said that, I'm at least open to the possibility (albeit still skeptical) that a binding limit could be needed in the future.  Expanded thoughts here: https://bitco.in/forum/threads/gold-collapsing-bitcoin-up.16/page-569#post-20503

Also, I *really* don't buy the small-blocker argument that says we need to constrain the block size limit to make it cheaper for people to run so-called non-mining ""full nodes."" Expanded thoughts [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7hqdck/craig_wright_dont_run_a_node_to_help_the_network/dqt0isj/). I'd also highly recommend reading [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7e06jm/big_blocks_how_far_can_we_take_it/dq2boad/) by /u/ForkiusMaximus that dismantles the idea that non-mining ""nodes"" play a meaningful role in Bitcoin's security model."

There is a network fee (which is essentially the processor charging you a miner fee) then you have to pay the actual miner fee on top of that. For a top up fee of about 9$. So your 100$ in bitcoin turns into about 91 real spendable dollars
It doesn't cost you anything to buy with a USD debit when you have sent them Euros initially?
You'll hand over your private key to an insured bank and buy things like you would now.
"In primis thanks for the apologies, it's all good :).

I get your point and I appreciate it, but I don't completely approve it, since I fear that an unlimited block size could harm the decentralization of bitcoin (full node cost).
Also by having unlimited size, and very low fees, it could let malicious users spam the mempool, which could be a big issue for full nodes.

What do you think about these ""cons"" of your unlimited block size idea?"

We don't necessarily want a huge blockchain, just a blockchain. 

If it's huge, that will be fine. Data storage and data transaction capabilities will increase over time as well. 

If the community and the monetary incentive is there, even more money will be contributed towards this end.

Best case scenario is that Lightning network or another solution gets implemented on Bitcoin Segwit in _such a way_ that it proves all our security concerns wrong, while Bitcoin Cash finds its own place in the ecosystem. -That doesn't seem to be where we are going however.

">There are plenty of goods that are safer to buy with crypto.
>> Such as?

The big one: All black market items. Such as, but not limited to, drugs and medicines complete with multiple choices of rated vendors and escrows. This would include using your untaxed crypto to buy anything, since the crypto itself would be black market goods.

But even strictly legal goods can be purchased with increased privacy, which means no risk of having your credit card information stolen or being the victim of riddicule/extortion because you bought something that could be considered unorthodox in your particular group of peers.

>I paid for my VPN last year with Bitcoin. They cut off my service after a few months and I had no proof that I paid. This year I just used my credit card.

One service through one company. That you picked. Guess we'll have to blame it on crypto?

>>All covered by Credit card companies... which is nice.

Even when they are, you still have to pay for it indirectly. Costs are absorbed by the system as such and your fees are a part of that. They don't just disappear.

>I've been using Revolut which pretty much lets me swap currencies at spot rate though.

For someone living in a developing country with sparse infrastructure and fragile/hostile political alliances, being depandant on one company is far from optimal. If they are even able use it.

What's early could be debated, I might say two years before that but you were certainly still earlier than most. ""Killing"" the banks is, as you say, rhetoric and you don't have to think bankers are all evil cronies or that the legacy financial system should collapse with many casualties. But what we wanted to have happen was a transcendence of the past, not simply an integration into the already existing parameters.

>Its wildly delusional to think that Bitcoin would replace FIAT or be allowed anywhere close to being a competitor.

Especially at this point, it would not seem likely. I was always sceptical of how far this particular cryptocurrency would go in replacing it, but the ability to adapt and modernize it within the scope of the white paper as it gained adoption was still immense. And it still is, if we can just fix some of its recent issues.

> It would be fairly trivial for Governments and Banks to severely disable Bitcoin.

See that's a major thing that we keep trying to tell Bitcoin Core supporters though. That's what we want to work against. And who said that we were gonna stop with just Bitcoin? We are cooperative agorists. We have always been aiming for much more radical decentralization than that.

>Banks could just stop the on and off ramps for FIAT getting to and from Bitcoin exchanges... job done

Another point we've been trying to make. We need decentralized exchanges, such as Bitshares, coupled with anonymous markets for trading regular goods against cryptocurrencies.

You've probably heard the Bitcoin pizza story? That's how you establish money. Not through currency speculation.

>Well we can debate this forever I guess. The market will make Bitcoin into what it wants though.

Bitcoin Core/Segwit will be what the developers, the miners and the community that supports them want it to be. Banked Gold 2.0 sounds pretty good to me.

">I'm not deluded, outside of the DN markets ... crypto commerce is tiny.

Of course it is. We are a still a tiny group of people that hold anything other than Bitcoin Segwit (which is not to say that we don't also hold it), out of which many have very small holdings and a living wage in regular fiat.

>Also, there's very little need to use Bitcoin to buy anything anyway. Paypal, credit cards and bank transfers cover most bases.

It sounds like you don't get where Bitcoin came from at all or why people started using it.

>You must be deluded if you think most people would spend money which could be worth much more in the future.

Crypto people are not most people. Especially not serious early adopters of Bitcoin. Many even prefer a deflationary currency.

There are some already today, that hold and live on nothing but cryptocurrencies. Some are early investors, a few get their wages in it and others just sell their fiat as soon as they can once they get paid.

"How is my response not serious? I am trying to state facts and **trying** to discuss on what's the best course of actions. I am a developer, not a bitcoin expert, but I can still understand the basics about this.
Do you understand that to declare block size increasing a scaling solution you are saying that it would be enough to handle a world-wide used bitcoin?
It's pretty easy to calculate how big the block size would be to handle visa-only transactions.
Currently visa handles about 2000 tx/sec (I don't have the exact number here, but it should be enough to make a very rough comparision, feel free to get the exact numbers and correct me if you want) and to handle that (again rough calculation) we would block sizes of over 500mb (going conservative on both tx/sec of visa and block size, using an average size per tx), which would mean that the size of the blockchain would be increased by about 25tb per year, with a needed upload speed of 200Mbps, does this look like a viable scaling solution right now, to keep bitcoin decentralized?
Please reply and explain me if I am wrong and if *only* block size increase is the scaling solution (again I think current bitcoin's block size is not enough and it will have to slowly increase in time, with additional solutions in place!)."
The name doesn't validate, just the BSB and account number.
"How is it decentralized if only miners and exchanges can control Bitcoin? 
That means they control everything and our money is under their direct control, I don't feel safe by giving them the full power, I would prefer a world where everyone can run an in-house full node if they decide so.
It also means that if a government (ex. China, which has the higher number of miners currently), wants to seize control of Bitcoin they can easily do it by getting full control of the miners's companies.
I do not understand why a second layer would be worse or any different from having multiple miners controlling everything, it would be actually way cheaper to run LN nodes than to run a full node on 500mb blocksize, am I not right?

By having a second layer and ""small"" (logical, viable to normal people) block size we could run most of the transactions on the second layer and still keep our freedom by keeping most of the money on the blockchain (yes, kind of how our current bank system works, the bank would be the blockchain and the rechargable card would be LN, you would put a low quantity of your money on LN and keep, most of your money, safe on the blockchain, remember that the bank system works quite good, the only issue is that we don't have control over it but banks and governments can do what they want with it).

That's true, but I do not really think block size increase is enough for long-term.
"Why is LN not a solution? remember that it is a layer 2 solution, which will ease layer 1's (bitcoin) volume, not substitute bitcoin. Bitcoin will still need a block increase like bch did anyway, but this could make things scale :).
Remember that also increasing block size, without having a technology increase (ex. higher bandwidth and higher average space on consumer pc), will increase centralization."
Re-read and tell me where I said that, and then consider who's retarded.
To be fair sarcasm doesn't really come across over text and it wasn't obvious satire to me.
Fair. 140 sat/byte still typically somewhere in the ~$4 range. Again, not great and way too high. But not $17. I'm in the camp that LN will fix this. If it doesn't Bitcoin will have to find a better solution or else increase the blocksize. Learning how to sweep addresses, learning how to manually calculate sending fees, sending transactions in batches, using Segwit, sending at the right time of day... these are all solutions that are easy to implement for massively reducing fees to 20,30,40 cents.
its 1/10th of the fee the OP describes. Lets not forget, that if BCHs price was 10 times as high and usage was also 10 times as high, fees would be a lot higher than what you see now

"It is exactly like that.

If you invest in Bitcoin you are speculating that the price will go up.

"> It's certainly not far from a Ponzi scheme with the Pump & Dump strategy.

So this is a little weird. I think your criticisms are valid, but I think they apply to most every crypto, and are not specific downsides to BTC as presented.

For example, let's look back a bit... hasn't BCH been pumped and dumped a few times in the last five months? Hasn't _every_ coin? How should we really define the sucker threshold? Paying $15k for 1 BTC that was once $2k is a sucker to you, which is reasonable. What about $1.4k for 1 BCH that was once available for $300? Sucker territory or not quite? Reason? What about $150 for 1 LTC that was once available for $20? $4 for 1 Miota that was $0.40 a month ago? Were the guys who bought ETH at $200 suckers since it was $10 a year before? Who here are the speculators and who are the suckers? Perhaps it is more complicated? Would it not be more accurate to say that this issue is fairly systemic and universal in crypto?"
I hear what you're saying, but I still don't think it's similar to a pyramid scheme at all. Perhaps similar to a Ponzi scheme, but it doesn't seem to me that anyone is pulling the strings besides the market itself.

"Saying that increasing the block size limit is ""just a temporary fix"" isn't a serious response because it could be said at *any* block size limit. If the limit were 1-kb, you could say the same thing.  The bottom line is that even if you're 100% convinced that we need (or will eventually need) *some* economically-binding ""consensus-rule""-type block size limit (because you're not convinced that a ""natural"" limit exists or will be sufficient), such a limit cannot be set *arbitrarily* or *inflexibly* without doing serious (and ever-increasing) harm to [Bitcoin's money property and basic value proposition](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6emrtd/three_ways_an_arbitrary_capacity_limit_harms/).  And again, re: second-layer solutions, my point is that they're not scaling. The only way to scale Bitcoin is to scale Bitcoin. That's not to say that ""second-layer solutions"" don't have their place; they do.

"The exchanges are able to exchange your BTC for 15.000$ because other suckers are willing to buy in at that price. 

No one really wants to accept BTC, if one does it's mainly to exchange it for Fiat. 

While that's perhaps not technically a pyramid scheme, surely you can see the similarity by the fact that once people stop buying in at 15.000$, the price may drop to almost 0$, until some speculate BTC could gain some value again. Which may not happen if another currency like BCH gains a majority instead.  

It's certainly not far from a Ponzi scheme with the Pump & Dump strategy."
Same thing with XRP will cost you $0.00001 and take a maximum of 3 seconds. Thanks Ripple.
What this neglects, is that neither has stable value to be a reliable currency because of the constant fluctuation. So when you factor that in, which provides a better return in relation to the fees? (Keep in mind that in this example, we're talking about moving $50k, not buying coffee every day)
"Lol it being adopted to steam does not mean that the majority of steam will be buying with bitcoin. There was probably about .01% of users paying with BTC...it means nothing that they can no longer support it.

That's my whole point. If BCH was adopted to steam, it would be YEARS AND YEARS before the MAJORITY of steam purchases were made with BCH as opposed to the other payment options. Then and only then is it popular enough to even consider the need for low tx and uber speed transactions. Consider that and then take that to a global scale, and not just on Steam. When the world is paying with cryptos as much and often as they are paying with debit/credit then there will be a need for cryptos to be suitable as an actual currency. That's too far off to worry about though right now.

To act like because one coin is ready for payment and the other isn't is currently irrelevant.

It's only relevant when the world is ready to do the MAJORITY of transactions using crypto as opposed to other payment options. Until then, all cryptos are store of value and to think otherwise is pure ignorance.

It's a paradox too, because each coin has to TOUT it's potential for being a currency in order to garner new investors and grow it's network of users, but at the same time, that isn't the reason to hold onto any given coin at this moment. Again, it's a paradox."

Edit: Also, for those who don't know, coinbase owns GDAX (same login info used), so your friend likely won't have to buy more btc to transfer it out as long as he transfers through GDAX. Also, plenty of exchanges have eth/bch trading pairs, so he can get eth instead to transfer through GDAX to get bch without incurring the additional coinbase fees."

What is this bullshit man?  I tipped a guy 20$ in BTC last night and the fee was about 50 cents and it was instantly in his wallet.  
Is this subreddit about finding a viable cryptocurrency, or are we just about shitting on btc? I've got a pretty broad portfolio of crypto, and more and more this place just seems to feel like jealous gnashing of teeth rather than intelligence conversation and news about bch.
"Isn't this what the Lightning update I keep reading about is supposed to fix? Faster transactions and lower fees? 

I remember a time where we paid more often than not with checks which often took 2-3 days to process from our accounts, minus the high fees."
Op doesn't know you can specify multiple outputs in a single transaction 
The term fee is misleading. It should be called a tip since you decide how much you want to give for increased levels of service. 
Your point is valid but I would argue that you are probably not being smart doing that. Same as with fiat you hv credit cards for small purchases and bank transfer for larger purchases. For argument sake imagine you buying a $10 item from alibaba from a Chinese supplier and instead of using PayPal you decide to use bank transfer I believe you will end up paying 2-3x the item price. To come back to you point the fees is high yes, but chose the right payment channel for the type of purchase you doing. 
Try sending from a segwit address, its cheaper. 
No, you counted the transaction fee twice. The item cost you $83 and you happen to have $17 worth of dust. Besides, you would never have bought anything if you had any sense, don't you know that it's going up! UP!
"Call me a fool, but if the item costs $66 and the fee is $17 why overpay for the item?

Instead just pay $83 worth of btc."
until lightning? then its all very different indeed. You jus cant rush these things! 
This does indeed boldly demonstrate the need for 2L solutions like LN and sidechains for the average individual user.
You can send bitcoin from gdax for free to your wallet. 
Who buys $5 worth of Bitcoin? For what purpose?
"For any trolls reading the above comment, here's a link in case you're scratching your head about 'IQ':

Sounds like a liability to me.
"70 sat/byte gets confirmed in 4-inf blocks right now, source: https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/

Stop shilling..."
While you are right you have to take into account that setting a 70 sat/byte fee is basically a gamble right now. If due to variance no block is found for 30 minutes it could happen that the queue has built up so much your tx will not confirmed within 1 hour. Even though it is probably < 20% likely.
Why the fuck are there so many transactions at 400s/byte? Is that the standard fee for one of the popular wallets? Jesus Christ. It's obscene that wallets don't make it clear you can change fees.
Looks like it costs $16 right now to get in the next block: https://bitcoinfees.info/
Nobody knows how to set fees.  You can easily think you are setting fees right, and then the market and network conditions change and then your transaction gets stuck.  
Been saying this for a good while. This has been a time of uncertainty if I have ever seen one. The fact that this is blowing up right now isn't a coincidence.

">Agreed. Transactions with BTC is pretty bad right now. BTC, in current form, is not a currency at all. It's more like ~~Gold.~~ a pyramid scheme.

FTFY"
Is it like gold...? If the dollar amount held is low enough, it might be trapped and worth nothing unless fees drop briefly and miners every get around to moving it. That minimum dollar amount seems to be moving upwards.
"Don't you mean ""a store of value"""
"Gold isn't nearly as inflationary as BTC. Oh I know technically the 21M coin limit is unchanged, but the 21M coins thing is really just a limit on how much wealth is transferred to the miners.

Not content with ruining BTC as a medium of exchange, **Core has essentially busted the thing that made Bitcoin digital gold**, so no, BTC is not like gold. 

BTC is like gold that crumbles away every time try to move it."
Falls out of the mempool after a couple weeks doesn’t it?
You can't do that to buy an item
When you convert bitcoin to bitcoin cash is that considered a taxable event in the US or are they considered the same asset?
very good idea!
"Atomic swaps require guaranteed confirmation within a time limit or one of the parties can cheat.  Not something you would want to do on BTC unless you set a very long timeout, in which case you  may lose with a sleasey counter party if there are adverse market movements.  Lightening Network has similar real-time performance issues.


"
Meanwhile, there was a 13 billion dollar XRP transfer that cost less than a dollar in fees this week....
As of right now, bitcoin is an asset to store value and for large purchases or transfers.  Small purchases don’t make sense on the current system.  This is not news. 
Bitcoin is digital gold.
I spent $20 and ended up paying 50% fee it's bullshit. 
They have killed the utility and therefore the value. Bitcoin Cash has the utility and therefore the value will follow
This will only make sense to trolls with an IQ of 70 and below.
Do we have to have these posts every day. It doesn't look good. Everyone knows the BTC fees are currently high.
*shilling intensifies*
If you buy an item worth 66$, the seller has to charge you an additional 17$ because otherwise he can’t spend the BTC you sent him. So in fact you have to pay the network fee twice, and then whatever remains face the same issue.
You forgot to mention by the time the $66 payment arrives the price of BTC has fallen so you need to send a supplementary payment to cover the difference.
This is pretty much how you get fucked by fees.
The Money Changers are back in The Temple.  
I sent 150 dollars of bitcoin to poloniex last night and I was charged 20 dollars as a “dynamic” fee. 🙅🏼‍♂️ it seems bitcoin has officially become an asset to me and not a currency.

"The only thing putting me off from contributing to this community is the rhetoric around blockstream.

Blockstream is a company with there own unique agenda. If the community of bitcoin users wanted something in bitcoin, or wanted to use something else, they would. You can't say blockstream makes up hundreds of thousands of users minds for them."
If you are paying $17 fee for a $66 item, you are getting scammed. 70 sat/byte is getting confirmed in 1-3 blocks right now. Shouldn't pay more than 2 dollars. Still not good, but obviously not $17. Stop spreading fud.
"That's why the only useful thing you can do with ""small"" bitcoin balances is wait for them to be worth more.

At the point they are worth enough that the transaction fees are an acceptable percentage, move them to an exchange and sell them for a more practical coin.

This strategy only works while bitcoins value is increasing faster than the fees.

Not forever. Bitcoin has, unfortunately, doomed itself. Once it stops growing, it effectively destroys the coins in addresses with balances lower than some threshold defined by the current fees.

Attractive."
"It looks like transactions are getting confirmed right now for 100 satoshis/byte which is closer to $3 for the avg transaction, not $17. Still high but  fees have come way down and the network is still very congested.

I also don't know how to set fees so I pay the max to make sure Im in the next block.
Agreed. Transactions with BTC is pretty bad right now. BTC, in current form, is not a currency at all. It's more like Gold.
you could decide to set a reasonable fee and wait months for the transaction to complete

A friend of mine just got into the btc game a few days ago, sent me a pic of the first $5 worth he bought on coinbase. It felt bad to pop his bubble by informing him that that is how much the transaction fee is. I told him to download a wallet but not move the money to it until he buys more btc... How sad...
Why would you move it?  The best use case for bitcoin is never using it and hoping other suckers drive the price up /s. 
What is the point if bitcoin if its slower and more expensive than VISA?
lol I moved over $30k this weekend with BTC and paid less than $20, and this was several different transactions... You can set your own fee guys...  You can set your own fee... 
Tried sending in BitPay with super economy and it was $28. WTF
Also you owe goddamn taxes on it :(
Always the same words, enough! Feel sick!
lol
Stellar Lumens (XLM) my dudes
Thing is they don't want transactions on the blockchain less than 10k USD. They're happy as it is, the fee rises are what they expect and planned for.
who gets the fees?
Won't the lightning network solve this issue?
Don’t get me wrong I have made a lot. But these fees are just not working. But I’m still a big believer in bitcoin. 
"Can anyone explain what the proposed solutions to this problem Are? Is there a way to fix this without forking? 

Is this just sabotage by a small few who are ringing out the sponge expecting to move to a different coin when they kill BTC?

I remember the fees being high but this is absolutely ridiculous lately. I just leave my coins on coinbase because I don't feel like getting mugged on my way out the door. "
Wait half an hour and your $17 will be $30! Or $7...
Is there a chart anywhere of current tx fee vs confirmation time for BTC?
What are you on about? Fee for next Block right now is 2.60$. If you can wait till weekend it's 0.20$
Atomic swaps are coming and this will change everything. 
Same old record in here.
Did you know this before you did the thing?
"So how do you propose to fix this? increasing block size is not scaling, it's just a temporary fix, which would work now, but what then?
Posts like this makes me cringe, every crypto-lover should only wants a new technology to have a better world with a world currency that everybody can use.
Do you understand that bitcoin currently has a volume that bitcoin cash does not even compare to? what's the meaning of comparing the fees of them when the difference is so big?
Try to be more mature and figure out a new technology to scale this currency to the world-wide, not crying out loud with this kinds of posts... 
That's really all it is about, shall it be LN or any other technology I don't really care, but the proposal of Bitcoin Cash is really not viable, and it looks like nobody here can understand it, which makes me deeply sad.
We don't need internal wars, we need to figure out all together the best way to grow and scale to the real world :)."
"This is funny. Using BTC, I spent a 5 figure sum with 3 inputs and paid just $1.75 in fees. It took 24 hours to confirm.   
The example you give is bogus. Sure, if you need faster confirms then you need a higher fee right now, but BTC development is not static and this is not a permanent situation. Indefinite scaling on-chain *will* lead to centralisation of nodes.
"
We need to understand that BTC is not a currency. It's a commodity like gold and when go to superstore with gold, they will charge you extra to convert that gold into something more acceptable to them.
You have $50k you want to move from Germany to USA. It cost $21 and takes an hour. Can’t even come close to that with a bank. Great job BTC...
"Totally agree . what if ltc with lightning network atomic swap happens ? People would use ltc to pay instead ? 
What you guys think? "
"Yeah the fee is obv. a problem, and not only for ""coffee"" transactions.

I wanted to buy something yesterday for 150 EUR total from a store where I was always using amazon pay (and amazon has my xapo bitcoin credit card details). 

They now take bitcoin too, I was happy a short moment then I realized it will cost me more in fees lol... 

So amazon pay (2% fee) + the cut xapo takes from my purchase (3%) vs around 10% on a straight BTC purchase (maybe even much more if they use bitpay because they take an unfair extra ""network fee"", in that case you pay 2 times the fee).

:("

You are among the 20% that move around 80% of the value in the economy . Bitcoin works great. 

At the end of the day you decide to buy coffee, and have hundreds of alt coins to choose from, so you pay with BCH/LTC/DOGE/ETC/ETH/BTG/VTC  and if you want coffee 3 months from now IOTA (but no fees)"

"Unfortunately atomic swaps were another false narrative.  There is no need for segwit or malleability to do atomic swaps [as Jimmy Song says in this video](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/722laa/interesting_interview_with_jimmy_song_about/).  There have been atomic swaps already on BCH from what I have heard.  I don't know how much market demand there is for it, but if it solves people's problems then great.  But beware of the false political narratives like atomic swap needs segwit, or LN needs segwit.

"Great observation Forkius.

Let's also observe a few other things that don't get mentioned enough.

The first is the impact of the block size on mining efficiency. Everyone and their brother has heard that Bitcoin are super wasteful to mine. What nobody ever mentions is that with a 100MB block, BCH can be literally 100x more energy efficient than BTC, mining 100x as many transactions and serving exponentially larger numbers of users for the same mining energy.  This is a fact we should hammer home every time we can (hint /u/memorydealers).

Bad news: while Lightning might allow lots of people to transact offchain cheaply, it doesn't do diddly squat about the stinking waste of energy that is being consumed to mine the puny 1MB chain the thing is layered onto: we will still be able to point to the 1MB chain and say, all that electricity to produce *that* when LN works on top of any blockchain (even ones 100x more efficient....)

Another important point that doesn't get mentioned enough is the implicit wealth transfer (confiscation) when high fees render small wallets unspendable. When this happens it's as if all the low value wallets get burned and the value of their coins transferred to larger value wallets via additional deflation.  

Now I'm no central planner but wealth transfers from poor to wealthy sound like a profoundly bad economic plan for any ecosystem."
"Yes. The limit is 300mb. We are half way there and rising. Rate of new incoming Transactions is now higher than processing speed (3/sec). The mempool will never be clear again unless Blockstream politely asks people to stop using their money for 2 weeks.

This will all change when LN goes live. Why are you lot so impatient?
Bitcoin is losing adoption (Steam). Bitcoin Cash could easily take it's role but Core fucks it up for all crypto.
"Anecdotally it seems to be your average consumer who doesn't want to get left behind. They have seen BITCOIN BITCOIN BITCOIN buy now before the price rises further.

"> You have $50k you want to move from Germany to USA. It cost $21 and takes an hour. Can’t even come close to that with a bank. Great job BTC...

That's not really accurate.  You can come very close to that with a bank.  I own an import-export business and I do international wires almost every day.  Granted, if you go into a bank and don't do regular wires, most USA banks will probably charge you around $30 or so, but I pay $22 for my company's wires, and the funds are transmitted immediately,  Within about an hour the recipient can see the funds as an incoming deposit.  BTC fees are getting so high now that I suspect if you sent a large $50K transfer you might very well pay higher than $30 in BTC tx fees, and more importantly, you would have no guarantee of when that transfer might be confirmed.  The bank can guarantee you the value date same day. I'm not saying the bank wire is much better, but if BTC fees keep rising and if the mempool remains congested, it would begin losing its allure."
Yeah lightning and other technologies could come and fix all the issues true. I just don’t have any faith in the core developers on bitcoin. 
Miners.
If it requires you to create an account to have a wallet, it's a shitcoin. 
Bitcoin Core club
Yeah that's actually a smart way to do it. Will a Bittrex address always point to your account, though? Like even years later?
Just to get their feet wet, i guess lol.
It is news to a lot of people who thought Bitcoin was a cash system and bought it thinking it was a payment system.
The store of value argument baffles me
Yea. Pretty much anything is better vs Bitcoin, evolve or get extinct 
I'm Canadian but you should be able to buy it from exchanges
No level two solution exists that does not depend on dependable level one performance with predictable confirmation times and fees.
I do this too. How is gdax affording that?
"On top of that, try sending it from a wallet that allows you to set fees yourself. 

Exchanges typically overcharge you on fees. Especially if you're not in a hurry with your withdrawal. Moreover, fees are computed in satoshis per byte. Rather than blaming ""Blockstream"" for high fees they should blame USD for decreasing in value relative to BTC ;)"
"Yeah someone pointed that out to me, I'll let my  buddy know ;)"
Interesting, how much is the foreign fee? I'll let him know abt saving money by getting out of coinbase via gdax. Also gonna tell him to sign up on QuadrigaCX because it's local, we live close to Vancouver.
Well unfortunately using GDAX requires 2 pieces of identity (coinbase only 1). I have been trying for a week now to it him to accept the 2ed piece. You get a message verification takes 3-5 minutes with a timer running to let you know how long you are waiting ... well after 1h30m usually it gives up. The whole thing is completely broken.
So I got some BTC in coinbase, if I want to buy some pc parts on scan.co.uk via bitpay can I do this via gdax and not be charged a fee? Is paying via bitpay essentially the same as sending BTC to a wallet?

"**Intelligence quotient**

An intelligence quotient (IQ) is a total score derived from several standardized tests designed to assess human intelligence. The abbreviation ""IQ"" was coined by the psychologist William Stern for the German term Intelligenzquotient, his term for a scoring method for intelligence tests at University of Breslau he advocated in a 1912 book. Historically, IQ is a score obtained by dividing a person’s mental age score, obtained by administering an intelligence test, by the person’s chronological age, both expressed in terms of years and months. The resulting fraction is multiplied by 100 to obtain the IQ score.

Its not a liability because its not a sort of debt. Even if it all goes away the poster above doesnt have to pay any more. Its just an asset that degrades quickly with transfers.
This is true because the market is wrong. The market is wrong because it attributes value to a transaction system that is expensive to use. The market is wrong and traders who bet against it will profit from their decisions to bet against it. Many of the same people who are betting against the market today are doing so because they see value where the market does not — they see value in Bitcoin Cash because it does everything Bitcoin does but is meant to support billions of users, whereas bitcoin is meant to only run 3 transactions per second. A payment system that sends 3 transactions per second is useful, but it is already obsolete since we already have the technology available to process far more.
That website is horrible and always very inaccurate. I run a business where sending with the lowest fees and getting the quickest 1st confirm is of paramount importance. I bundle transactions to save on fees. I'm extremely well versed in what sat/byte is needed. Always use https://jochen-hoenicke.de to determine what sat/byte is getting confirmed consistently, add 10-15 sat/byte, and send with that amount. Almost always confirms in 1-3 blocks and I end up only paying 20-30 cents per address I send to. Never use a recommended fee from wallets, always send with a custom tx amount. Use Electrum.
With Bitcoin Cash it only costs 0-5 cents.  Small blockers are even [looking forward to $1000 fees per transaction](https://cointelegraph.com/news/ari-paul-tuur-demeester-look-forward-to-up-to-1k-bitcoin-fees), which is much worse than even banks.  The white paper says Bitcoin is supposed to be a peer to peer cash system, not a settlement system.  I guess Segwitcoin is no longer Bitcoin anymore.  Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin.
"$21 tx fee and an hour?

why not just use ripple then ? Tx time is in secs, not hours like bitcoin. Much less volatility too. And you'd pay ~$1 for the tx rather than $21
by the time it gets there, it may be worth double too

This goes in direct opposition to the pitch for bitcoin over the last decade. Its always been billed as a fiat killer with the possibility to get it integrated into everything.

It's actually software and needs to be upgraded.

"Great news for people with crypto revenue income. They can now directly spend that money in store. Very convenient.

"So basically it's like a regular prepaid debit card that you purchase with Bitcoin Cash? That would mean a person could essentially do all of their regular purchases (bills, grocery shopping, etc.) in Bitcoin Cash (indirectly).

No. Debit cards and on-chain transactions. I don't mind a middle man if his ability to mess with my finances is restricted.

In due time, adoption will have grown to the point where I won't be needing this card anymore, but until then, it's one useful tool in our toolbox."

"https://www.thebalance.com/how-does-a-prepaid-card-work-960201

> **How Does a Prepaid Card Work?**

> With a prepaid credit card, you deposit money onto the card, sort of like a gift card. Then, as you use your prepaid card, the amount of your purchases is deducted from the balance. As you make purchases, your available balance is reduced.

> Let’s say, for example, you deposit $300 onto your prepaid credit card. After paying $150 for a car rental, you’d only have $150 left to spend. Once you’ve used your entire balance, you have to reload more money onto your prepaid credit card before you can use it again.

> By comparison, a credit card gives you a credit limit that you can borrow against for purchases. You have the option of repaying your purchases little by little over time or all at once.

> Managing a prepaid credit card is more like managing a checking or savings account than managing a credit card. You don’t have to worry about interest, finance charges, or late payments.

> What you have in your account is all you’re able to spend. On the plus side, there’s no revolving balance, minimum required payments, or due dates to think about.

> **How Much Does it Cost?**

> Prepaid credit cards can come with a lot of fees. For example, the Account Now Prepaid Mastercard, has charges a monthly fee of $9.95, an ATM withdrawal fee of $2.50 (per transaction), up to $4.95 reload fee, $2.50 for each ACH transaction on your account, $1.50 to make a balance inquiry at ATM and $1.00 for each monthly statement.

> Each time you incur a fee, it comes from your balance, giving you less money to spend."
"Lol, in what world would someone create this system when he could have already dumped on us at $2800? Arguments such as ""he's improving the acceptance of BCH to steal money from you"" makes no sense. Further, majority of community wants BCH and not BTC. I'm sure they know what's going on a lot better than you do and this would be easy to see coming for them.

Keep trying shill."
"You are biased. He may very well have ""learned"" about it but have different opinions than you "
These exist for BTC so STFU
Why are you so mad? haha
What Blockstream have been doing is bullshit. You've been brainwashed. 
"It's all Bitcoin; Bitcoin Cash even more so."
What is Bcash? Don't u hear about BTC debit cards? How is BTC spending going?
You're confusing one thing with another.
Only jealous assholes will say this is a scam. 
They aren't aware that BTC debit card exist
You're obviously confused. What do Brazilian payment sites have to do with this?
"No, Bitcoin Core has several undesirable modifications; Bitcoin Cash is much closer to the original Bitcoin."
You're confusing three different coins.
Bitcoin cash forked the blockchain to add transaction capacity and so that a chain without RBF and SegWit carries on. Bitcoin cash is the original bitcoin with the original and best scaling plan. Right now bitcoin core has no scaling plan at all.
Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin. Deal with it. 
Satoshi's Vision!
"So we’d be right back where we started with credit cards? Except now, Visa gets their cut too? I thought the whole point of the crypto movement was to shift away from the outdated, dominant financial institutions and infrastructure.

The driving force behind Bitcoin’s selling point (as referenced in the original white paper) was trustless, censorship resistance. With a Visa-backed Bitcoin Cash credit card, you’re inviting a third-party into the mix that can potentially inhibit (and track) your transactions/transfers. 

Do we remember what happened with Wikileaks donations? After some governmental pressure, Visa turned off the ability for people all over the world to contribute to Wikileaks using their payment system. Why invite that sort of censorship possibility (that has the power to decide how/where/when you spend your crypto) into this movement? 🤔"
Yes, it is.
Is Wirex any good?
Absolutely essential. That needs to be very clear both inside the community and written down clearly for the future so that we don't fall in the same traps as Bitcoin Segwit just a few years down the road.
VISA is in the end of the grief cycle. MasterCard still isn't
"I think you misunderstood my comment. I was not criticizing it in any way, it might be great for Bitcoin Cash. But, if the upper questions are not addressed properly, many people (including me) will refrain from using this kind of Credit Card. 

Edit1: If I think about it more in depth, especially the privacy and censorship part (from VISA) go against anything that Crypto stands for. Sorry, I know this will get downvoted but that's just the way it is. 

Edit2: I don't want to say it's bad and I am very thankful that Roger Ver does these kind of things, but I won't use it if VISA does not accept the terms of Bitcoin Cash (instead of Bitcoin Cash accepting the terms of VISA like lack of privacy and eventual political censorship)."
"> but should get people spending

*Allow people spend and accept as they like. Amount of pure Bitcoin and VISA infrastructures is absolutely incompatible"
"> If you only add small amounts onto the card each day for spending e.g. $100 there's not much they can censor. They can't touch the BCH funds in your actual wallet.

I meant that you can't send money to whoever you want if VISA blocks the transaction from their side, which they did in the past. Generally they do this if it is ordered by the US. The downside is that they wont tell that they blocked the transaction, they just pocket the money for a certain time. "
[deleted]
Wait... So is this the BCH answer to the lightning network then? Charge a debit/credit card instead of have funds on a lightning hot wallet?
"It works normally. I should have said ""all crypto debt cards issued to Brazilians stopped working""."
"> But, if the upper questions are not addressed properly, many people (including me) will refrain from using this kind of Credit Card. 

The problems you raised are present in *any* bank card. To avoid them, only hard cash or direct crypto transfer, and we all know these methods unfortunately have their limitations.

"
You have a problem with optional layer 2 extensions to Bitcoin providing profits to the layer 2 actors? Better not use lightning, should it ever escape development phase.
We need more info first, dunno if it actually converts to Visa or uses it's own system to somehow bypass fees? I'm guessing though
"The Shift Visa card (for BTC at this time) links to a Coinbase (sub)account.  I like this card because I put crypto in the account and it converts to fiat at time of use.  This gives me the advantage of investing while also allowing easy access to merchants.

I got one to try out a few years ago, and deposited about $350 worth of BTC.  Checked a few months ago and it had grown to about $2000.... so... free money (of sorts).

I would love for this card to have a BCH logo on it, so I can tell a merchant that it would have saved them 3.5% or more if they simply accepted crypto directly.  Advertising!"
Ah, so it's not converted to fiat when you top it up?
As I understand it, the 'legacy p2p' will be the settlement layer. Still there. Once lightning takes the bulk of the heavy lifting, with the additional goal of supporting microtransactions at higher orders of magnitude of adoption. Bigger blocks are coming on Bitcoin (legacy, base layer) as well, eventually. That's how I understand it anyways.
"Nail on the head.

/u/tippr 108 bits"
"I can buy to the same shop already with a normal credit card.. why I should use my BCH? I see no convenience at all if they'll be just converted into fiat again.

Instead I will lose money due to the double exchange.

And this won't help the merchants to adopt the BCH, because on their you used a debit card like anyone else, they ill neither know you used your BCH to pay... how this is a ""good"" thing?
"
There can be only 1 BTC!
Attack the market from all sides, I say.
"Merchants could sell products for 2-5% cheaper (more buyers), or for the same price but with no VISA fees (more profit) by choosing a cryptocurrency with low/negligible fees. 

At the moment, adoption is too low and first-movers inherit the risk. It's cards/approaches like this which encourage merchant activity on the blockchain, to drive future adoption.

Importantly, this only works if fees remain low."
"Do you realize that Roger Ver, at EVERY point he can, references Satoshi's ""peer-to-peer electronic cash system"" as if it's some type of gospel for what Bitcoin was supposed to be and he forked BCH to supposedly fulfill this vision, and then at the first chance he gets he brings in a third party payment solution (Visa) that is the antithesis of everything he says BCH is about. The guy's only allegiance is to the solution(s) that make him the most money. "
Your guess is right. It's your official billing address that matters, not your nationality.
What is their reasoning for not providing the service?
"For the same reason plethora of merchants accept both card and crypto directly

VISA will turn into perfect BCH universally recognized merchant wallet or someone else will. If someone else will, it'll have less friction than VISA. Free market is awesome"

"Well that sure is convenient. BCH forks off for a very specific reason (to become peer-to-peer, cheap, trustless currency) but when Roger Ver decides to promote a Visa mastercard for BCH (third party, increased fees, centralized) none of the BCH fanboys has a problem with it. Bitcoin has never ""promised"" to be anything because there is no central authority. It goes wherever consensus wants it to go. That's the point of being a decentralized currency. BCH on the other hand seems to change itself based on whatever Roger Ver wants it to be at the moment. If you were truly a BCH supporter rather than a Roger Ver supporter, this announcement would be ATTACKED viciously by the BCH community because it's against everything Roger says Satoshi's ACTUAL vision for bitcoin was.
"
And you charge it how? With fiat. The thing I may not want to hold.
"> bla bla ... this announcement would be ATTACKED viciously by the BCH community because it's against everything Roger says Satoshi's ACTUAL vision for bitcoin was.

No it's not. It's another tool to make BCH more convenient to use while actual BCH infrastructure is being built and widespread support for pure BCH transactions is implemented. There is no-one forcing you to use this card, same as no-one is forcing you to use BitPay's BTC debit card. You get to choose yourself.

I won't even dignify all the Ver trolling and character assassination with an answer."
The whole point is to be able to receive BCH in exchange for goods or services on the internet (or not) and being able to spend them without having to go through an exchange. It might not fit your habits but it opens up many more use cases.

"Because you can't use your Bitcoin Cash everywhere yet, by allowing this card, you can use BCH to refill your Visa card and then use that card anywhere Visa is accepted.

Yes it does sound a little farfetchd but it sounds like this is a workaround to be able to spend BCH at Visa accepting stores while a proper direct payment system is created."

In a perfect world we can pay with our Bitcoin [Cash] everywhere. Unfortunately, adoption takes time. Until then, bridges are necessary.
"There's a big difference, Bitcoin Cash will continue to be workable on-chain and we, the community, will continue driving adoption as best as possible.

There's a lot of driven people around these parts, and many more who will join us down the line. "
That's the end goal yes but you won't reach that goal without building bridges first. 
Mostly correct - but someone has to start the chicken and egg. We will need to convince our shops to accept. I the mean time we can stay short fiat.
Hey ignorant, your Blockstream's Bitcoin used to be accepted at some places and now it's accepted at fewer places then before. Bitcoin cant scale on chain... shame. Bitcoin Cash is getting a few bridges until you dont need them any more.

Except here, the roads are owned by a third-party that can close their pathways whenever they want (or if they lead to destinations they’d prefer you don’t visit) and charge you for the benefit. Better to build your own infrastructure from the start so you can go wherever the hell you want, no permission needed.

Do you realize these already exist for BTC?
I have. I just use regular ones though (Well, credit cards).
I don't know. Most likely yes, since the nationality doesn't matter to most issuers, just the billing address. When a Brazilian comes back, the billing address change, and if the issuer finds out, it will most likely cancel the card. But I am just guessing here...
"Depends on how they implement this. There are two options. A BCH wallet they have control off, on your behalf, and every time you make a transaction with a card, they debit that BCH wallet. I think Xapo card worked that way.

The other, more likely option, is that they give you a deposit BCH address, and when you send BCH there, they convert the whole amount to fiat immediately, and credit your card."
This is needed as long as shops keep stupid / unaware accepting it direct. But bitcoin is about to compete with all the middlemen.
Why is it useless? I recently got one, haven't bought anything with it yet...

This is excellent news. Ok, it gives Visa an entry point into crypto, it is for sure a work-around till BCH is accepted more broadly, but on the other hand, it'll give a much needed way to spend and use bitcoin cash in real life and will greatly aid adoption.

"I believe this is a useful intermediary step for awareness and adoption. It is the kind of compromise that is needed to be done for acceptance.

>Starting October 1, 2015, that liability for fraud shifts from the bank to the store in cases where the bank has provided an EMV credit card but the store has not upgraded to an EMV terminal. The logic behind this is that the credit card issuer did everything in its power to protect the consumer, and the store ultimately dropped the ball, so to speak. This creates the incentive for both the bank and the store to upgrade to EMV

Oops, just looked at my Bitpay Visa debit card and it does not have a chip."
"Yes, please. Tenx is useless. These morons still haven't shipped my card and I ordered one in early August.

Very good question. Is this the first step of Visa *adopting* Bitcoin? Or is this Bitcoin *adapting* to Visa? If it's the latter, then we must tread carefully to not let this become the standard.
This is a work around until businesses accept BCH directly. It's obviously not perfect, but should get people spending.
why anyone would continue to support people who can't win a uncensored debate is beyond me, but if you like using bitcoin then might I recommend you learn about bitcoin cash
"> What about privacy? Will Visa still get all my data inlcuding my clear Name, Address etc?

Yeah for the transactions you make with the card. So choose wisely.

> What about the fees? Visa has roughly 2% fees per transaction. Would we pay both fees (Bitcoin Cash and Visa)?

Card transaction fees are always paid by the merchant, usually they list the card price everywhere to account for it. Sometimes you can get a 'cash' discount. Bitcoin Cash fees to top up the card are nothing practically at 1 Sat/B..

> Edit: What about payment suspension/censorship as Visa did with Wikileaks?

If you only add small amounts onto the card each day for spending e.g. $100 there's not much they can censor. They can't touch the BCH funds in your actual wallet.

They must be so insecure of their own offering if they think they need to attack ours  ><. No one pays that many shills to target something that is worthless.
What happens if someone has a card made from another country and tries to spend it inside Brazil?
Yeah, Visa and Crypto are on the opposite ends of multiple spectrums. It's just dumb to embrace it because it can't work without giving up quite a few crypto fundamentals.
Too late ... Core developers already sold out to AXA and multiple other large financial & services conglomerates. Perhaps you need to go and complain at /r/bitcoin ... but you can't without being banned.

Bitcoin Cash debit card is a debit card that is not linked to your bank account, and you top it up by sending BCH to the issuer. (bitcoin.com) They will likely collect some KYC data from you, because that's the law."
Bet your ass he's getting a portion of everything on the backs of you guys. How you guys are falling for this blows my mind. 
It is a prepaid debit card that you can fund with Bitcoin Cash
We don't know yet but I'm sure whoever in charge of implementation is on top of it and making sure it doesn't become a problem. For all we know it could be brand new code never seen before.
Considering ongoing wealth transfer, it still beats inflation in many-many countries
"Why does the website advertise Bitcoin Cash as ""the"" Bitcoin?

Isnt Bitcoin core the original code? With BCash as a fork? "
Yes please! I would be first in line!
There was some proposal in the US to treat crypto purchases under $600 as non-reported (just a foreign currency purchases are handled).  I have not heard if that was ever signed in to law or if it is part of the tax plan.
These cards exist for BTC today (so I don't get the haters).  The Shift card works with Coinbase and converts at time of purchase.  Most other cards i have seen convert at time of deposit.  I prefer Shift's method as my value grows when I don't use the card... better than a cash-back reward!
If we hadn't wasted the past 3 years fighting to get a '1' changed to a '2', we would have merchant adoption.  Instead the opportunities got pissed away and we have to practically start from scratch.
Please do this! I would love to use BCH more!

Yes it does, based on my definition of how I interpreted ""correct decision,"" and sure. However, instead of putting words in my mouth, use the definition I gave for correct decision and you will find that you're just being a shit and arguing the semantics for what a correct decision is based on a definition that the OP of this reply chain did not give in his BCH hyperbole, which for the sake of your last paragraph I should add I don't own any BCH, don't give a fuck about the drama, and don't even have an opinion on it, and I'm financially avoiding it until I understand the truth of each side and not the hyperbole.

Literally the 3rd sentence

> In an idealized free market economy, **prices for goods and services are set freely by the forces of supply and demand and are allowed to reach their point of equilibrium without intervention by government policy.**

Equillibrium is the inevitable correct decision that free markets move towards and away from as supply and demand pressures change.

I even saw [BlockStream CEO Adam Back tweeting about Bitcoin Gold](https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/922569768770478080?lang=en):

>  Bitcoin Gold/BTG futures (0.085 BTC) higher than Bitcoin Cash/BCH (0.055). http://yobit.net/en/trade/BTG/BTC … and @bitfinex adding soon.

Its funny he doesn't call it ""bgold"" either does he and tries to use it to attack Bitcoin Cash with propaganda.  It shows they are threatened.  Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin.  Segwitcoin has diverged from the original definition of Bitcoin [as Peter Rizun explains, a segwitcoin is no longer a Bitcoin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hO176mdSTG0), since segwit breaks the definition in the white paper of a chain of signatures.  So BCH is the longest valid chain.  Any future forks are segwit forks, unless they use the BCH ledger.  Also its not how much temporary hash power a chain gets that matters, its accumulated proof of work that matters.  Its the chain with the longest proof of work.  The hash rate must be sustained for large periods of time to get more accumulated proof of work.  Also even if a chain becomes longer as BCH has in the past then it does not mean its the longest proof of work chain.  It would be longest by block height, but since difficulty was lower on BCH it did not have as much accumulated POW as BTC even though the blockheight was higher."
So?

Create the one world currency!
I think the whole of Japan will turn to Bitcoin Cash when economy goes boom, since they have worst debt to GDP among modern countries. 
 BCH is the true bitcoin I agree. Assume that if there is money to be made forking then someone will do it. There are already six planned forks upcoming in Dec 17 and Jan 18. These are all going to be called bitcoin with minor code changes. If one of these chains gets more hash power for a few hours then they will be the true bitcoin for a few hours right? Then perhaps maybe a different bitcoin gains majority hash power, will the true bitcoin change yet again? Then what if years in the future if the original bitcoin core manages to lower TX fees and falls back within the definition of 'peer to peer electronic cash' as per the original white paper, then will they take over, assuming they still have the most hashpower? Not trolling - I'm just asking the question because it seems difficult to maintain a fixed number of coins in circulation when there's so many new coins calling themselves bitcoin. It seems like a major risk to the true bitcoin. 
"So we agree that the capped supply and deflationary nature of Bitcoin makes it less likely to be used for regular consumables. At least until regular fiat has been abolished.

So why is everyone focused on its ability to buy coffee? One day it will buy coffee, but it's my opinion that the people pushing for mass adoption right now are those most concerned about their own personal stake. "

Suggestion DENIED
nothing can make legacy bitcoin the real bitcoin at this point. Have you ever read the whitepaper
adding satoshi nakamoto underneath like in the image would be nice
Blockstream stole the brand so we are taking it back. How is this unfair? 
"Everything is transparent here.

Many here see Bitcoin Cash as the real Bitcoin, or rather a closer version to the original whitepaper, as well as correspondence with Satoshi.  So there is no need to change the name of anything."
"> but calling this sub as BTC

Sub predates August split. Nothing can be done about it. r/btc is historical name"
Yeah. A lot of other altcoins also fit the white paper better but that doesn't make dogecoin the real bitcoin.

Looking like it might just have to be text embedded within the image itself, which of course wouldn't be link-able to the actual whitepaper. Maybe there's still another solution out there though...

Yes!
I would have to bring up how Bitcoin Cash isn’t Satoshi’s creation, even if there are those who think it’s his vision.  If anything, it just makes it more obvious BCH is trying to steal BTCs success.

Don't get me wrong i like Bitcoin Cash but calling this sub as BTC and using it completely as a tool to give support and to promote Bitcoin cash not  fair .Don't get me started on the conflict of interest with the mods here and Bitcoin cash.

i respect when people get offended when someone calls bcash but you are   claiming your bitcoin sub but being a totally BCH subreddit altogether.

either rename this sub to Bitcoin Cash or have more transparency."

And maybe highlight the „bitcoin“ and the „cash“!
Do It.
Yeah that's an awesome idea. Hope it happens 
This was the most human thing I've read on the whole topic and near perfectly suns up my experience over the past few months. Wow. Great post
Thank you!
So they wanted the equivalent of $150 to push it through which I thought was insane. It eventually was picked up and transferred after 4 days stuck in the mempool, thank god!
I checked that out and they wanted the equivalent of $150 to push it through which I thought was insane. It eventually was picked up and transferred after 4 days stuck in the mempool, thank god!
"To that point though, the banks completely control that. I have two friends who cannot use eTransfer any more, one because of a fraudulent transaction he didn't initiate, the other because the person she was sending to was flagged for something.

So, not that."
Now you are the one using hyperbole. Who in this thread said $82?
"I won't speak about your specific circumstances, but I'll say the following in general about crypto:

- If you don't control the private keys, you don't control the coins, and
- If you do create a personal wallet, check the transfer fee to get your coins out from Coinbase to that personal wallet."
Also note that when you move BTC out of coinbase, you will incur extremely high fees. You'll have to pay these fees again the next time you want to move the money *in* your wallet. If you only have $140 worth of Bitcoin, you might be losing 10% of your total holdings every time you send a transaction.
Sure but it's not $27 either
Excuse me, speak for yourself please. I'm only highlighting the need for moderation with some of the arguements if we're to retain our integrity. I have no agenda, just that of pursuing a fair view.
But you still have to pay that fee even if you use cash, so from the consumer end there is no difference in cost. 
True but we're talking in Blockstream standards lol :p
"Something something Federal ~~Express~~Reserve something Hayek something something something Digital Gold.

https://prestonbyrne.com/2017/12/08/bitcoin_ponzi/"
Then why do I get so many relatively cheaper transactions? Is it due to the average user using really shitty wallets? Or transactions made up of a lot of inputs? (I tend to move larger amounts between exchanges and Trezor)
they will actually implement a lending system into bitcoin and use the fees as the excuse for it. bitcoin will become what it is supposed to fight. what's more disturbing is people don't question this.
They don't care - those who do have already made the switch and there aren't many of them. 
You've spammed this same message over and over
I think he's talking about shops taking 0 confirmation transactions for small purchases not 2nd layer stuff.
3 inputs. 1 output. Used trezor. Just look at the median transaction fee graphs. They are closer to $27 than $3 right now 
"But it's so centralized!!!  Bitcoin is decentralized! Unlike WU no one group or company controls Bitcoin. 

/s"
He should get recognition for being the pioneer that brought cheap Chinese knock-offs to the crypto realm.
That is not the plan for bitcoin. That's just pure cognitive dissonance. 
"Why was Bitcoin changed into that though? Why can't it be what it was intended to be if others can be?

It doesn't need a lower value to be able to be used in small transactions. There is no real reason to have BTC transactions the way they are."
"What exactly is so bad about doubling every year or so? My **phone** today can already handle blocks larger than 1mb. It doesn’t even need to process the whole block, headers are fine.

And why have two separate coins when we can have one coin with cheap transactions that can be a store of value and have microtransactions. Small blockers don’t think cheap transactions are possible long term. I disagree."
"I'm in agreement with you that those fees should be lower. 

How large was your transaction? I guess my question is why am I paying so little, relative to fees like $13 and $27? Is it a matter of a better wallet? (I'm using a Trezor) I mean I try to give the benefit of the doubt, but it feels to me like people are structuring transactions with the worst possible inputs so that they can further the narrative, not conduct legit transactions. "
Litecoin is a much better choice.
I consider $3 literally 3000x more than the fee should be. There’s no exaggerations in this thread. People are actually spending $27on transaction fees. 
"Litecoin is faster and cheaper that BTC and BCH. Not to mention it's been around much longer that BCH. 
Litecoin is a beautiful thing. Yes I am a shill."
If the average fee link is showing double digit fees, something has to be bringing up the average. The evidence is pretty plainly there
That's fair. I've been in and out of BTC since '11 so I do get it. I just don't want this place to turn into anti-/r/bitcoin. Bitcoin Cash needs to prove itself now and we'll be measured by the accuracy and clarity of our reasoning. 
"It was pretty bad. See the discussion below at the time. https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/6imd5u/can_we_make_a_mega_thread_for_people_to_explain/dj7eq1w/?context=3

Wish I'd picked up some of that $13 Eth at the time though!"
Well the difficulty targets 2.5 min block times so 4x the possible throughput. Not that it matters, there's only like 25k tx a day.
But at all it would be better if transactions become faster and cheaper..
Oh yeah that’s right! I knew I was missing something.
The plan is for lightning network. I don't have faith in it though. Outside r/bitcoin, people still want bitcoin to become a currency, not a store of value.
Your bank account is insured and they pay you for the privilege of keeping it safe for you.
"Okay, okay *maybe*. But…

…*WHY*?"
Go away Litecoin shill. 
"I'm not speaking to that. I'm speaking to OMG I BOUGHT A COFFEE FOR $9 AND PAID $82 IN FEES!!1!! That's the hyperbole I'm talking about. Do your best to stick with the thread. 

The arguments against lower fees would probably go further if they'd focus on reality rather than extremes. $8 to transfer $13k isn't bad, but BCH can do better. However, that's not as sexy as saying that people are paying $30 to send less than $100. "
But it doesn't make sense to use lightning to send Bitcoin to you. Or to Newegg or Overstock. So I don't think it will solve this. 
You asked for evidence concerning high fee when you paid 3$ for a simple transaction yourself. I think that says enough on how the other sub is changing the perspective of what BTC should be. Just two years ago everyone was promoting BTC for its low fee(by low I mean under 5 cents low) and increased usage around shops and online platform. I don't think i have to explain how BTC looks right now. 
"For the first question: the answer is the same as why i dont like banks. With the blocks going up in size soon there will be very few nodes around. 

For the second question: we already have Litecoin so why even create a second Bitcoin to begin with? The answer to this question in my opinion is control. I already use LTC for cheap and fast transaction. And guess what its much faster than BCH even, 2min confirm compared to 10min (at best). 
Again there is room for many altcoins to thrive but i right now i cant see BCH as a real alternative, thats just my view, i might be very wrong, who knows this is crypto after all. "
That wasn't *that* bad, was it? I don't remember balking at fees at any point, nor wondering where the hell my transaction was
Don't you dare!!! xD
That's true, I hadn't considered that. 
Shhh, emotion is the only thing allowed in this sub
LTC is just bitcoin with a X4 supply and a different difficulty adjustment. Same 1mb block cap
So there is a plan?
"So $27 in this thread; every bit as hyperbolic. Everywhere I look on this sub it's numbers like that. Meanwhile I regularly pay $2, $3, $8 to transfer thousands of dollars. (to confirm within 2-3 blocks, not sit idle in the mempool) What do I know that the average person in this sub doesn't?

"
Ya and lightning network is the proposed solution for that.
All the numbers you listed are multiple orders of magnitude more expensive than it should be. I personally paid $13 for my last Bitcoin transaction. You can look at the blockchain and see fees above $27 so there is no hyperbole here. 
$8 is more than 8000x what it should be. It should cost less than a cent. No hyperbole here. 8000x is a large amount right?
$27 was actually the average transaction fee on the BTC network yesterday.
Welcome back to the shit show. Things are dramatic and tribalistic right now. Things will blow over eventually. 
You can understand why I'd ask for evidence considering the average fee link above and my own experience doesn't correlate to that though.
"ETH isn't crippled: it's had exactly one instance of network congestion pretty much out of the blue: I think ragging on them for that unexpected one-off is probably a bit keen. ETH also has several incoming improvements and isn't, as a community, against on-chain scaling

BTC, on the other hand, has had years of warning."
Any payment below 100$ is spam and an attack on the blockchain, don't you know?
Bitcoin Cash is like that for now. It will have have the same problems later.
No, the fees only rise when blocks are full and a competitive bidding process to be included in the next block begins. As long as blocks aren't full, the network can support near-free transactions for everyone.
Here is the thing. The difference is what are you trying to do. Make a return on an investment, which both will do IMO but Bitcoin, maybe more so in the near term. Or do you want to change banking, governments and world commerce for the better? Then Bitcoin Cash is your best avenue in the long term. 
"> I just put $100 into bitcoin when it was at 11.3k right before the spike. It’s now at 140. Are you saying I’m in the wrong place and should look at bitcoin cash?

You have to make that decision yourself. Bitcoin Cash is an alt coin that currently has cheaper transaction fees due to low volume/bigger blocks. Bitcoin has some things in the works to make transactions cheaper and instant like the Lightning network. Both coins are useful, but Bitcoin will always be Bitcoin, and Bitcoin Cash will always be Bitcoin Cash, don't let anyone tell you otherwise. "
I will presume you did so in Coinbase? Have you tried moving the Bitcoins out to, say, a personal wallet like Copay or Coinomi?
"> Can we please just admit that the plan isn't for fees to stay super expensive or just as bad as they are right now.

I'd love to, but sometimes I feel like that doesn't even make consensus on the other sub

"
Those fees hit the seller not the buyer
Why is it a store of value? Simply because others are willing to buy into it as well, despite fees taking a generous cut of that value?
Can you elaborate on why it's for banks?
[deleted]
That's how I was explaining it to my friend. Sure Bitcoin won't run the world but something in the future this has created definitely will. Only thing is it will be difficult having one that isn't owned by a corporate entity.
It's just digital gold now. 
Do you honestly think $3 is low? Wow have times changes
Is everyone ignoring the elephant in the room that is SegWit? Why is everyone focused on an older version of bitcoin? 
"If everyone switched over and Bitcoin Cash suddenly took over with 100% of BTC's transactions, wouldn't the BCH transaction fees be 1/8th of $27.20?

Can't buy coffee with a $3+ fee either."
Is it for people making 100k a year?
Investing in bitcoin is for everyone, as long as you are ok with a centralized currency where everyone leaves their coins on an exchange.
With transaction fees of $100 it's basically for people making $100/hr and up.
I just put $100 into bitcoin when it was at 11.3k right before the spike. It’s now at 140. Are you saying I’m in the wrong place and should look at bitcoin cash?
Not even $100 a day is logical. 
"Can we please just admit that the plan isn't for fees to stay super expensive or just as bad as they are right now. 

This bch vs btc argument seems really similar to eth vs btc."
"The stingiest persons on the planet are the rich.

"Maybe this is what the bankers wanted after all..  
Make bitcoin more like a bank so the banks don't seem so bad.

.  
.  
You're welcome."
Sadly, Bitcoin has become less and less useful as a currency, and more like a store of value. Except, if it's not being spent, or used, does it really have any value anymore?
"I think the real question is: Who is bitcoin *for*?

I think you will find the answer to be: **The banks.**"
Gold isn't used by people on less than $2/day either...
Bitcoin right now is the first time a technology is taught Ed as game changing yet is worse than the things it was meant to replace. Thank god for BCH 
You paid too much. 
I can see a future where big banks and cooperation and the rich use Bitcoin Core as a way to settle or for large transactions. Bitcoin Cash is for the every day folk, Bitcoin Core for the elite. Once the censorship on /r/bitcoin and bitcointalk started it was pretty much game over for Bitcoin Core. 
"I bought a graphics card with BTC a couple of days ago. It was a 31 hour thrill ride of wondering if it would confirm at all.

I consider myself very lucky indeed. I wouldn't get to feel that lucky with literally any other coin, I'd just click Send and it would send."
"1.	Cheaper fees that this sub seems delighted to hit btc over the head with
2.	faster transactions
Basically you guys circlejerking over old release lmao!"
I can't argue that it shouldn't be lower. Just saying that the crazy hyperbole about fees doesn't reflect what everyone is paying. 
Hold up I never said it was low. Just that its lower than some of the estimates and wild exaggerations that goes on in this sub as well.
This is because of the brainwashing going on in the other sub. Using BTC as a currency is no longer part of their vocabulary or view of BTC. 
Thank you, this is what I needed.
I assume that includes the ones that don't get through as well?
$3 ain’t cheap
Right but bitcoin has shown it can build up enough transactions that even the next 8 blocks can't clear all of them.   So the BCH blocks would also fill up if all that transaction volume came to it's chain.  The fees would just rise at a rate that's 1/8 as fast since the blocks are 8 times bigger.
I wouldn't call Bitcoin Cash an altcoin. Imo it's an unresolved contentious hard fork of the Bitcoin Protocol. If BCH is an altcoin, then BTC is (Segwit) as well. 
You’re correct I just went into Coinbase. I have not tried a personal wallet. Is that something I should do that’s better? 
"Don't confuse who pays the tab with who is ""hit"" with it. If a business calculates the price it needs to sell a product at, then the payment processor charges a 3% fee on top of that, they do not lower the price of the item 3% to compensate for the fee. They increase the cost of the item the 3%. The consumer ultimately pays for it although the fee is buried in the overall cost. "
That 'elephant' barely even registers on any graph
"Interac E-transfers in Canada are free person to person, can send through e-mail or text.  

Retail business only pays 7 cents flat fee per transaction for interac debit."
That what attracted me to Bitcoin the first time. Now I see it has become a ponzi scheme and when people understand I think even if someone paid them they wouldn't use it. But maybe I'm wrong :D
What good is being your own bank if you're being charged >$20 every time you want to use your money?
You can be your own bank on many coins that don’t have a 20% fee
Because no regular users can pay this high of fees except in extraordinary circumstances, and blockstream is turning bitcoin into a settlement layer for lightning network which is basically a system of IOU’s, just like numbers in a bank.
Not even that.

That's why there will be a replacement. I have this theory that there will be a replacement, and then a replacement for that replacement and so on. It is some kind of great opportunity to make money like the Richie's. A kind of equaliser for those smart enough to capitalise on it. But....I've been drinking sooooo..
Bitcoin is cheaper than sending a gold bar by dhl !!
SEPA transfers are mostly free. So yeah, more expensive. Sometimes quicker though, especially on the weekends
I must be really lucky then :-) $8 is the largest I've paid. Ever. 
Yeah. The fee market is incredibly volatile. It’s a terrible idea that screws people over 
Yes there is a reclaim tool but as far as I know they haven't sent back the coins. I haven't checked in a week though.
I'm aware, you're supposed to reclaim them though.
SO probably didn't have enough to worry about? afaik it worked for everyone who did it.
"Your ""wheelless car"" can be replaced with *ANYTHING* of value (such as a block of gold). Then your analogy makes perfect sense all of a sudden. Surprise!

As soon as you understand that btc isn't meant for ""driving"" (as per your analogy) you will begin to understand how to use it. (And don't give me crap about what it was originally meant to do...nobody cares. As it is today, the use of btc is not what it was originally designed for; if you want that use, then use litecoin or bch).

PS: The entire reason cryptos are taking over is exactly because of how easy and quick it is to change them around. If you could instantly buy/sell the car, again, your analogy is moot."
Bitcoin is effectively worth 0 If you never convert it to fiat or a good/service. This is not even simple economics, it's just basic logic.

Transaction fees are literally the most important aspect for a currency. I used to use btc multiple times per day until the fees shot up. Now it's a worthless coin because I can no longer spend it because of fees. My btc just sits lonely in cold storage. Kinda sad
"Think he's seeing the case where the BTC rocket never runs out of fuel... so if you were a store and someone wanted to hand you BTC you may discount as first you want it (duh) (and don't want to pay the xfer fee?) and second it will be up 20% by the next business day.


Here is a more real case.  Say you decide to go live in Argentina... with all your BTC.  Every day you start out by finding someone who's desperate to off load the local fiat because it is just tanking or wants to get rid of some durable that they have a loan out on.  So they are willing to take a hair cut to get BTC and you are going to need that item or fiat to spend that day.  Win/win?"
"He's serious.

The reason is, _if you believe in Bitcoin_, then you'd rather get paid with it, as a deflationary currency, than with an inflationary fiat currency. It's one of my favorite things about a deflationary currency, in that it flips the advantage over to the consumer. If consumers holds their value in deflationary currency, they're able to demand better prices and better products due to the fact that they're no longer incentivized to spend, spend, spend! [and so producers have to better their service to compete]

It doesn't just have to be the business either--I'm fairly sure that services like BitPay already could and _did_ offer such discounts, at least prior to the  fee situation."
Of course I use myspace, I buy Bitcoin from plebs on it via my time machine and arbitrage the fuck out of it on Korean exchanges - plus my myspace page has animated emojis. 
$3 is more than enough? What fuckery is this. Fees should be < $0.01

"Gold.

Storing gold without using it is the same sht as bitcoin."
I love me some chicken tenders.   That's the thing about media hype, once the cycle turns on bitcoin, those tethers are like blood in the water for sharks.
True. I'd like to invest in Altcoins, but I suspect they'll all go down with BTC in the end, making me lose most of my money before they are reasonably priced.
"If you are in it for the GAIN$ then that’s all that matters.

Worldwide electronic cash is why I’m here and Bitcoin Cash is delivering"
To spend it. You know, realize all that value you've been storing.
To not starve
Because fiat is more useful. What's the point of money if you never *use* it?
Because you can't do nothin with it
Do you really use BTC for microtransactions?  How does that work 
Bitcoin Cash I suppose.
BTC or BCH?
I'd send u some dollars, but...
Stop the hate train on Roger he's just one person on the BCH team. The lightning network is the real enemy it's the bankers wet dream. You should look into who's funding Blockstream/Core. Banks are the enemy not Roger.  
"It's the gold of digital currencies. If that's true than its the most valuable thing when we start using ""credits"" in the future. Fiat ain't gonna be around much longer. And digital seems to be the next step at least over gold, new paper, or whatever...

Um
Wait, you're saying im not rich? I got like a hydra and nero

I'd say bitcoin is really fucked if the media hype cycle ever dies down.
"Way back when, the insult hurled at anyone holding BTC was, 'Bag Holder'.  Meaning, no one wants to be the one holding the bag when everyone else bails.  That person, likely persons, will lose all of their investments.  This was in reference to Bitcoin being a Ponzi Scheme.

Now with Bitcoin, if the hype becomes a frenzy, the whales will decide who will be left holding the bag.  When they move, very few of the rest of the people will have time to react.  If the public at large becomes the bag holders, crypto's image will be damaged, possibly irreparably. All of the tulipcoin prophecies will come to fruition. 

Who loses money if crypto succeeds?  They're who I would suspect are the most likely to try and make this happen.  The fact that it seems like Tender, a suspect source of Bitcoin investment, is driving a lot of this frenzy, I would suggest caution at buying in.

It could go to $50k, but it could also be a few hundred a coin, tomorrow."
Why do you need Core when you have Cash? 
">why do you need Bcash when you have litecoin

to create an on-chain, world-wide currency that doesn't rely on the spoke and hub model for transacting. "
"They lost control (of narrative, implementations, miners, developers, investors). Which shouldn't be there in a decentralized system in the first place.

They (banks and govs) can pump Bitcoin to $1M and still the Sword of Damocles (defecting miners and investors) is hanging right above them in the form of a competing SHA256 coin (BCH) with the same genesis block.

And the funny thing: Assuming there is an actual community of old-timers and smart new comers supporting BCH at all circumstances, there is no way to eradicate it. Hence, BCH will be around just as long as BTC. This means the further the ratio diverges from 1:1 the more risky it becomes for your holding if you put all your eggs in one basket."
Well, the equivalent would be waiting for that GTA money to be worth something in real life.  Though, if the reckoning comes, these die hard 'hodlers' are going to be stuck watching their 'wealth' disappear, unable to do anything due to the network.
Can you name any other assets which have no utility beyond their store of value?  Ugly gems, undrinkable wine, unlivable homes maybe?  What do you think will happen to something that exists solely for greed?

"I love this analogy. It's spot on. I remember all the hype that built up around the Segway. It was billed as so revolutionary that cities would be re-designed to accommodate them. It was imagined that eventually everyone would have one. People would ditch their bicycles and only use their cars for long trips. The Segway was the ultimate answer to inner-city congestion!

Then the public reveal happened, and the general reaction to all the mega hype was a resounding ""wut"".

It's easy to think something is revolutionary when you drink the PR kool-aid and play around with it under controlled conditions before the general population gets their hands on it. But reality, it turns out, is a different beast.

Bitcoin itself was met with very little hype and fanfare when it was first introduced. That tends to be how the real revolutionary ideas take shape."

not at the moment. The company explains what it means to do with the XRP ledger though. What about it isn't clear to you?
If he truly spent 50$ on a transfer from bitmex, then thats also not the whole truth of a transaction fee if you tell me theres fees just for using an exchange.
"Yeah, lots of libertarian shitbags going ""taxes are theft boo hoo"" when taxes literally made it possible for them to use roads, go to school, have clean water that didn't kill them growing up and so on and so forth. Paying taxes and living in a civilized (ish) nation is a privilege as well as a duty.

Don't like taxes, move to some war-torn African nation and see what the other option looks like."
"To be fair, the major complaint is that taxes are structured to favor the mega-wealthy; as a result, taxation, as a whole is viewed with contempt.  The ideals behind taxation are not inherently 'bad', it is merely that in practice, taxes are easily corrupted.  If someone could do for taxation, what bitcoin did for currency, that would be the next singularity.

PSA: 'avoiding' taxes is legal; 'evading' is not."

"Here are some reasons you should be concerned about LN:
https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7cwfm5/something_very_important_to_consider_about_bch/dpuc4yc/"
LN modelling simply assumes everyone is already using it ignoring the fact that in order to work in the real world it has to be actually adopted by real people. There are considerable barriers to that adoption.  https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7cwfm5/something_very_important_to_consider_about_bch/dpuc4yc/
"I guess I haven't seen the explanation you're talking about. Right now, if a company creates an IOU on the platform, there would be no correlating raise in market cap of XRP (is my understanding). never been too big into ripple, so I haven't researched it in quite a while. 

From what i've read XRP is used as an intermediary between other cryptos and ""in platform"" IOUs. and used to pay fees. I just found out they burn tokens that are paid in fees (lowering the total amount of circulating supply and raising the value of existing tokens) which is pretty cool. the circulating supply being only 40% of the total supply is a bit worrisome to me, but now knowing that they burn their fee tokens, I might pick some up (still have some more research to do)"
"Maybe one should just read their comment to say that it cost them $50 to get their Bitcoin off of the Exchange.  As an example, an exchange wants to charge me this, in Bitcoin, and it cannot be adjusted:
-0.00010000 BTC

It is labeled as ""Transaction Fee:""

That is a lot less than $50 and a smaller take than other coins, so I would say this Exchange is better than Bitmex, though I have no idea how long it will take for it to confirm.  That seems to be about 1/10 the current average fee. "
I guess government just pretend that they care about the tax income, anyway those income are neglectable comparing with the new money they get from FED: 500% taxation through QE, no amount of tax collection can compete with that level of income through money printing
"What? I don't get it..... 

_drool_"
"The XRP burn due to transactions is vanishingly small, it might as well not enter your calculations.

Also, technically, their ledger can track payments in IOUs and has had this capability since it began, but this is not really part of the company's current plan of how to give the native token value.

Their plan basically boils down to enabling XRP to be used as a bridge asset, mediating foreign exchange between exotic currencies (at least initially). They have a product designed to streamline this use case for FI's and liquidity providers, that are part of their network. They call this product xRapid.

So at the moment XRP's value is tied to the success of the xRapid product. It seems like it could work for them, if they manage to ""bootstrap"" it properly. They already have quite a few large FIs on their network using their messaging and settlement product, xCurrent."
interesting, I clearly have a lot more research to do before i make a move on that one. Thanks for the summary!
"No reason to dump all you have, unless you think the risk is high enough that you will not be able to do it at all of course.

It's going to be a wild ride. We better buckle down and work hard if we want to compete on speculative investment returns. But we should do so by providing a fundamentally valuable product."

"I do not know that it is a fact.  It does not represent the median or average fees.  You do not state how long it will take to confirm.  You did not ask if changing the fee was an option on the exchange. Maybe you know, but it does not seem that every exchange allows you to set your fee.  Of course, Exchanges also charge a fee. So given the current status, it is possible the Exchange set a $16 + their take, fee. And yesterday the fees could have been >$20.

You are getting downvoted for saying it was their fault without ever looking into the details."
"Not precisely. At least not in all cases...

I want to make a return on my investments, but I also prefer to invest in things that work, and that I believe are economically viable. I'm suspecting way too many people are buying BTC at $15k only because they believe some greater fool out there will take it off their hands for $50k. Not for ANY other reason.

I have positions in XRP, BCH and XMR because these payment networks are functional, tokens are more-or-less reasonably priced and they work well. BTC just doesn't.

While there are many new and potentially better DLTs out there now, BCH is recognized by the public and _actually works_ as opposed to BTC.

BTC + LN would be an expensive and corrupt version of Ripple, so I have no intention of supporting them.

XMR is pretty solid and has been around for a while. So, why not. I figured I should diversify a little bit."
I agree, which is why the idea of diversifying through crypto does not offset any risk. 
"Never said it was slow, I said for the current state, 3 dollars is more than enough. 50 is absurd though.

As far as I understand stamps are issued for a reason, something to do with postage.  Paintings, like all artworks, have aesthetic uses.  Gold lots of uses too.  I am more certain than ever that BTC isn't for me.

Only if you redefine Bitcoin in exactly the way required for you to be able to say this. It's a meaningless and entirely self-referential point and you could do the same with anything if you control the definition.

What are they thinking, that BTC will become gold? Even gold saw more usage has a currency for ALL your everyday purchase during the gold rush in Yukon/Alaska than this hyped scam coin. 
Bitcoin is obviously totally useless as a method of payment but I think all cryptos have an issue in this department not because they can't function as money but because no one wants to spend a currency that acts like a stock. I'm not sure anymore that cryptocurrency can actually become an alternative money for the world not in any significant way at least.
That's shooting oneself in the foot. Hoarding sth with no inherent value.
I understand Bitcoin as stocks. You buy it and are worth nothing until you sell them. The thing is maybe I'm missing something here. I think it's not worth to invest now because of its high price, i mean if you want to become rich you have to invest a lot of money in it, or just wait a looooong time until it reaches very very very higher values. Now I see this post and I understand that if bitcoin can't be spend, is getting useless and will loose it's value, but maybe I don't understand it very well. Can someone explain this to me briefly?

So they sell their product at a lower margin because reasons, and then have to lose more money when they transfer it to pay for things like inventory and staff wages?!?!?!

The more likely scenario is that they slap on a surcharge to cover the extra costs they are likely to incur. Just like many vendors do with credit cards.

BTC in its current state simply cannot be used as a currency. It's slow and more expensive than fiat transfers between any bank in my country."
I've been trying to explain this in /r/bitcoin but nobody gets it. The volatility is the biggest obstacle for mainstream adoption. Without stability it won't work as a currency in everyday life.
From my experience no one wants to switch off of bitcoin bc they’d lose so much profit bc transaction fee, no? So they just rail against BCH and say they’re doing the best thing. 
"Won't. Not can't. There's a difference.

">You can imagine that the rocket firing pushed on the fabric of reality and dragged the Earth closer instead of pushing the rocket closer to the Earth, but the force still only occured in once place and not both places.

So, it is not right to consider the relative perspective of the rocket being stationary and everything moving around **it**? Pretty sure that's not how relativity works lol.

">I don’t think that it’s reasonable to say that his observations definitely mean quasars are closer than we think they are. 

That's not what I was alleging. His findings are that quasars have vastly different redshift values than the galaxies they were ejected from and are connected to - redshift values are therefore not just a measure of distance/speed."
"> If the rocket is stationary, you have to account for the movement of every object in the universe relative to the rocket. If the planet is stationary, you only have to model for the movement of the rocket.

This IS the paradox. If it is valid to consider the rocket stationary, the man on Earth would end up younger. If you consider the Earth stationary relative to the rocket, the man on the rocket would end up younger.

If you say that one would not be older than the other, you are denying time dilation. If you say that one would be younger than the other, you are denying relativity (because relativity says it is **just as valid** to consider the rocket as being stationary as it is to consider the Earth is stationary)."
">Halton Arp didn't ""debunk"" the big bang theory. It takes more than proposing an alternative theory

Yes he absolutely did. He showed redshift values are not strictly indicators of speed. Which is the foundation of the big bang theory.

>I'm mostly wishing we were better at training folks on how to think critically and account for their own biases.

Start with yourself."
"Gravitational lensing easily accounts for how a distant object can appear to be in front of a nearer object, and gravitational lensing of quasars in particular is well documented. As long as other plausible explanations for the phenomena observed exist, saying your conclusion is obvious just by looking at the pictures is a copout.

Better instruments and better data sets than Arp had show that the correlation he found between quasars and nearby AGN disappears when including dimmer objects he didn’t know about."
"
Sorry, I’ll try to be clearer. 

It’s fine to consider the rocket as stationary. But when it’s engine fires, a passenger will observe that the relative velocity of every single object in the universe changes compared to their reference frame. That would require modeling it so that the universe moved around the rocket, instead of the rocket moving through universe. That is math is possible to do.

But, if you’re on the planet and assuming that your reference frame is stationary, the only object in the universe whose relative motion would appear to change after the engine fires is that of the rocket.

That’s why the paradox isn’t really a paradox. If the rocket is stationary, you have to account for the movement of every object in the universe relative to the rocket. If the planet is stationary, you only have to model for the movement of the rocket.  According to the paradox, either party should be able to consider themselves as in a stationary frame of reference, and observe time moving slower for the object in motion. But because one side fires rocket engine and the other doesn’t, their observations don’t match."
"Yes, that is the official narrative excuse to explain away the ""anomaly"", which happens every time there is evidence the current model is wrong. Look at this article: http://electric-cosmos.org/arp.htm. There are pictures showing quasars literally connected to galaxies (which were explained away by mainstream scientists as being coincidental lining up of actually unconnected bodies). There's also a picture of a quasar *in front* of a galaxy, which you can't dismiss or explain away and it totally destroys the foundation of the big bang theory. "
">This asymmetry makes it so you can no longer swap reference frames and expect to have identical results

I don't feel like my question was answered: what you're saying is that it's wrong to consider the rocket as being stationary the whole time?"
I don’t think that it’s reasonable to say that his observations definitely mean quasars are closer than we think they are. Not without accounting for the fact that there are other explanations for the observed phenomena, and not until others are able to repeat his study.
"A person on the planet will observe the rocket’s engine igniting, imparting the force that causes the change in relative velocity between them regardless of whether he considers his reference frame to be stationary or moving. A person in the rocket will also observe that the rocket engine ignites, which causes the change. He doesn’t look up and see the force being imparted at the planet. It only happens in one place, not both.

It’s not about who is really moving, it’s about the fact that force was applied in one frame and not the other. This asymmetry makes it so you can no longer swap reference frames and expect to have identical results. This is literally what special relativity explains."
My mistake. The error, then, is in the assumption that what he was looking at was a galaxy and a quasar ejected from that galaxy. A quasar is an active, bright galactic nucleus, not an object that can be ejected. Nobody has been able to repeat his observations, even with our vastly more detailed sky surveys. He was comparing objects that were unrelated, and assuming they were connected.
"1)I did not know about that.  I stand corrected.  Thanks.  To say ""it works with big blocks and it is not crashing"" suggests that it is currently using big blocks.  But I really did not know that it actually utilized a 8MB block as apart of its permanent chain.  Definitely a proof of concept, but doesn't imply stability like you insinuate.  I do look forward to seeing that day that it can be tested against.

2)Invalidates your claim that BTU did not work with big blocks simply because it did not fork the network.

> They don't even say it is not technically possible, they say that it will lead to centralization which to me is obvious bullshit and what is more I'd rather get more centralized network than a network that is unusable for buying anything less than a car

To me, it is not obvious bullshit.  The bigger the block, the larger of an advantage that nodes, physically closer, have in processing.  There is a correlation that hasn't been examined, or even relevent enough to be examined.  Granted, with other technologies in play, there may be a way to shrink that down.  The conflict is the order of prioritization.  Different ideas on how to approach it, but the whole insurgency came from impatient people who did not depend on anything to begin with."
Certainly there is advantage for nodes that are closer together but moore's law applies to internet speeds as well so increase from 1 to 8 MB should be eaten in about 4.5 years. Note that unlike pings which can't be increased forever bandwidth can be scaled indefinitely. In any case there is no study that says 1MB is somehow optimal. As for the impatient people the whole debate started more than 3 years ago and the issue was mentioned even earlier. Certainly this is more than enough time to implement this change. Also I am not seeing the push to implement it now when businesses are dropping Bitcoin because of high fees.
"There are several 8MB blocks in the BCH network I think this particular block was somebody testing if the 8MB blocks work (i.e. nothing would crash). There were also many blocks bigger than 4MB in times of market excitement that generated short term demand for more transaction space.

However my point is that the debate was never if any particular software worked. SegWit2x was flawed technically. The debate is that Core devs who are arguably most qualified to implement such a change and test it properly simply refuse to do so. They don't even say it is not technically possible, they say that it will lead to centralization which to me is obvious bullshit and what is more I'd rather get more centralized network than a network that is unusable for buying anything less than a car."

"1) Bitcoin Cash has not nor is it not using big blocks.  It is programmed to, but there hasn't been the demand to actually utilize it.  Real world scenario is still unexplored.

2) Bitcoin Unlimited accepted any block that had valid transactions; size wasn't restricted.  Consensus government wouldn't have affirmed it.

3) Says nothing about big blocks ""in general"", but at that time, every ""big blocker"" was pushing for the ""deployment ready"" BTU, which was trash.  So, it does speak about their overall awareness and competence on the measure.

"BTU does not equal BCH.

>Especially in light of just ho2 unusable BTC haw become with increased demand due to the rally. Do you honestly believe BTC can be used for anything but speculation right now, let alone doing ""more for less""?

It can be.  Speculation with a record of always appreciation biases speculation towards ""investment opportunity"".  It may cost $10-15 to move $1, but it costs the same to move $100,000,000 just as well.

>BCH is the realisation of the BU proposal for Bitcoin.

No it's not.  It's a compromise.  BU was aiming for consensus.  BCH was an admission that consensus could not be gained.

BTU crashed and burned because people were too quick to rush to judgement.  BCH is mitigation.

I told you, I am not against big blocks.  The ""big blockers"" were always a movement looking for a path of least resistance to continue pumping their own gains.  Nobody is here because they care for people in Africa.  That's just some feel good inspiration, to reinforce a position.

Who said it was impossible?  It is definitely possible.  My argument is that it shouldn't be a priority simply because bitcoin is worth money.  I think it is better if it does more with less.  I think people get ahead of themselves.  They let the money be the motivation, and were trying to rush solutions.  The people pushing BTU were blind.  They were what the big blockers were, for a while, before BCH.  All of them where wrong for pushing BTU.
You don't even know what I am talking about.  How would you know it has nothing to do with block size?  (it did).  And how is the implementation of big block solutions not technical?
"I know it was not due to big blocks because

1) Bitcoin Cash works with big blocks just fine and it is not crashing

2) Bitcoin Unlimited never forked the network so it worked with small blocks. Even if their big block code was buggy it says nothing about the big blocks in general."
"> All of them where wrong for pushing BTU.

How do you figure that? With BCH consistently holding between 10 to 15% of BTC's market valuation,that seems an oddly premature conclusion.

Especially in light of just ho2 unusable BTC haw become with increased demand due to the rally. Do you honestly believe BTC can be used for anything but speculation right now, let alone doing ""more for less""?

BCH is the realisation of the BU proposal for Bitcoin. You say they were wrong? So far the evidence doesn't point towards that, but I'm open minded enough to permit a reevaluation over the longer term:

RemindMe! 1 year ""was /u/tabzer123 right and the whole big blocks thing was misguided and wrong? Did BTC end up being able to 'do more for less', and did it manage to continue convincing the markets their view for a universal ceyptocurrency was the right one?"""
"1) https://blockchair.com/bitcoin-cash/block/479469 - here is an 8MB Bitcoin Cash block

2) So what?

3) It doesn't matter if any particular software was deployment ready. What it matters is that big blocks CAN work (and in fact work in BCH) and are needed."
