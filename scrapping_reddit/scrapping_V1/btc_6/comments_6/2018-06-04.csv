thanks, we'll definitely do our best!
yep, agreed. we've worked on this, but then didn't end up agreeing on a good place on the landing page, but we'll have to revisit it for sure
darn, this happened because we got a full page cover on Bitcoin.com and a mention on TNW at the same day, but i guess we shouldn't complain. i'm unwilling to pay for google maps, but at one point i'll have to do it i guess
there's a currency switch all the way on the bottom, but your suggestion has been made a couple of times, so we know that this has to be fixed!
 Airbnb might start accepting crypto, but they have a monetization model that's built around charging per transaction, compared to our aim to go fully autonomous
haha, yeah, their react-dates application is buggy af btw
"That's alright.  You've got plenty of time.  Airbnb is too big and (already) too bureaucratic to keep up.  I've been watching you guys since your first announcement.  I'm amazed at how quickly you've built such a quality product.  Keep up the great work.

On an unrelated note, making BCH the default payment currency would make a strong statement about supporting currencies that are meant to be spent.  I fully appreciate that decisions of this nature are very delicate.  That being said... be the change you want to see, right?

Either way, Ill be setting up a hosting account and using your service every chance I get when traveling.  I travel quite a bit and interestingly enough it's almost always for BCH related business travel.  There's one Bitcoin with promise and it's faster than lightning ;)"
We get a lot of demand in Europe and the US, Asia and Africa is really slow still (we don't have enough inventory there either)

yes, definitely...it grows organically at the moment, but we hope to integrate some larger property managers soon so that there's more to choose from
absolutely agree!
Planning a trip to Europe on crypto partially thanks to your site :)
exactly, the amounts large enough that bitcoin fees don't really matter that much. we're working hard to go fully autonomous with a beta in fall hopefully
hope to have you as a user someday
awesome! send me a mail to info@cryptocribs, and we can get all the properties set up for you
the entire search isn't perfect yet, we'll def have to work on that
awesome, would love to have you as a guest!
haha, that's maybe a bit of an exaggeration, but thanks anyways!
thanks Kuro, appreciate your support
I do not think you understand what I am saying. So I will ask you. Do you think there is only 1 true bitcoin. Or do you agree with me that each fork is also bitcoin?
Yeah, with all the legit sources you've posted with this, it must be true!
I bet they don't even check it anyway, it's only for legal compliance.
"Yet a copy of your driver's license assuming you have good credit and no fraud alerts is worth approximately $5000 on the black market.. You think coinbase isn't sneaking some of these out?

Edit: I meant coinbase, being one of the biggest and most legit crypto exchange has the most to gain/lose from these kinds of dealings... But really, who knows.. The world is full of exchanges now who operate entirely without regulation, the vast majority requiring your ID through your freakin' webcam. The best identity verification I've seen works in conjunction with a 3rd party similar to (I'm sorry to say it) Equifax so you don't need to serve up your entire identity on a silver platter to the internet... (because apparently it's already there for grabs under Equifax....) But whatever, no need to make ourselves more vulnerable. Just be careful out there, that's all I'm trying to say. All it takes is 1 clever asshole with a copy of your driver's license to potentially take your home and everything you have. Don't compromise yourself getting caught up in some kind of FOMO fever"
"You are correct. Guy has no clue.

"
"And check your sent mail folder for e-mail, containing sensitive data. 

And after deletion from Sent mail foder, check trash folder. 

'Couse mail accounts are hacked too ;)"
And you think they'll repass those comments to the third-party companies they hire to do the checking?
'Russians'
True but that could happen walking down the street and getting mugged, banks get hacked too. I mean there are numerous places where ill inteded individuals can get a hold of identities if they so wished. So all this fuss about crypto exchanges.. i do get to some extent, but then again, it can happen anywhere tbh. Just don't go around handing out copies of your ID to unknown exchanges. But i doubt Coinbase or Uphold or any other well established exchange would make getting to your information any easier than your bank would.

"> You think coinbase isn't sneaking some of these out?

I don't know the answer of this question, I would however speculate and say that it is not in their interest to do so."
Where can I sell mine
"> Yet a copy of your driver's license assuming you have good credit and no fraud alerts is worth approximately $5000 on the black market.      

Rubbish

"
If you don't comply then you don't get service. So go ahead and disagree, and you won't be using any exchange. But for those, who have to use an exchange, the least they could do is to express their dissatisfication regarding the verification process.
"> SSL added and removed here ;-)"
No. Why would you think that? It's enough if people speak up, it doesn't matter whether it immediately changes anything. The worst thing you can do is to remain silent whenever you are abused. So don't do the worst thing. Very simple.
Yeah.. Probably aren't siphoning off the piles of unaccounted for $$ that are sitting in the exchanges' account as well... Why would a company need money, right?
"no idea

But to sell it for that much I think you also need to own your home/have a mortgage with home line credit etc..

If someone buys your ID for that much for it it means they're planning to walk into a branch of your bank and pretend to be you, transfer all ownership over to them"
Fair enough. Doing something under protest at least shows you aren't blindly giving in to their demands, which appears to be rather common nowadays. Too many people don't ask questions or think critically when they should.
They are a profitable business, I am not sure what are you talking about.

The same reason I don't just give away my phone number at stores either. Protect your privacy when you can.
"Maybe I'm just paranoid :p

We should actually only be trusting any exchange for no longer than we absolutely have to.. is that not the rule of thumb in the anarcho-crypto-capitalist handbook?"
[deleted]
"I think people are way too open about sharing their KYC with random companies. First of all, its very unlikely that they delete it and given how many exchanges and crypto-related services have been hacked and past couple of years (hundreds) I wouldn't be too surprised if there's someone on DNM's selling IDs that they stole from an exchange or a crypto gambling site.


Second, I also run a non-profit that deals with public information, and as such I get a lot of DMCA. My first response is always to ask them for KYC so I can verify that they are who they're saying, and about 60% of the time that drives them away, but the other 40% or so actually do despite me having no need for any of that. There's about a dozen people I could impersonate on bittrex or at a bank just based on the images I have in my inbox."
"Comply? I disagree. You shouldn't allow yourself to be cornered into verifying your account in the first place, and that means ensuring you don't leave significant amounts in your account unless you actively trade with them.

&nbsp;

When the day comes (and I fear it may be soon, sooner than I think) that I won't be able to use any centralized exchange without verifying my identity, then I'll head over to decentralized exchanges."
Let's say this was true, its the opposite of having the data you give them being used/stolen. It does not display anything to do with data out, its a data in thing 
As long as they only used it to verify basic information such as DOB and Name, I can see it working....  Though it is highly unlikely.  As the Authority Number doesn't exist.  
Every time you are asked to send such photos remind them that they are incompetent at storing your personal data and demand your photos to be deleted immediately after verification. Say it out. Smear it in their face. When dealing with Bitstamp or some other exchange that already has been hacked in the past then remind them of it every time they harass you with verification. Comply to their rules but express your dissatisfication. Remaining silent when you are being abused is the worst thing you can do and it will turn your world slowly into shit. And it will be your own fault in the end. So always express your opinion, even if you know for sure that it will be ignored.
Holy f**k. 
Say hello to Civic!!! Al buy it to prevent security fraud
if someone had a picture of my ID and a photo of me holding it with both my ID and my face visible, what is the way they could extract the most money out of that?
Look at my lips: F A K E.
Source?
(X) Doubt
"Any decent AML/KYC service will have failed to pass this.

Companies running without AML/KYC is a different story, this is not a REASON to avoid verifying accounts on exchanges.

Businesses are governed by law and need to abide by the rules of the jurisdiction they are operating in.

The world is not Anarchy /u/crypto-anarchist86"
Identity theft from a fictional character the things we see now days
"i really doubt its true.

ФМС11111 \- this is stated in field AUTHORITY NUMBER. it simply doesnt exist"
what does ID fraud have to do with a security risk on that data? 
'Seciruty'
if this is actually true then holy shit. is this the kyc rule you are talking about??
No source, lol.
Any opinions about Kraken and its security policy and how ethical and responsible the people are who work there?
Actually it’s コンビニ, but hey let’s be dicks about it.
That is what the surgical masks are for.
"Yeah, this is the thing. I don't know a form of currency 7-11 and the other major chains DON'T accept. For Japan, it's par for the course.

The reverse is the more exciting part, adding legitimacy to BCH."
"I know the story, you can be all die hard all you want but it's whatever.

The bitcoin community voted, bitcoin cash really should come up with a new name, it is not botcoin."
"That’s not how it works. They accept cash and cash only - not credit, not cashless payment - straight up regular cash only.

Check the back of your utility bill - it’s specific about this. I think it’s an anti money laundering thing."
Such a service would make a boatload by offering 20% off.
I mean yeah I'll take it, I don't have anything against money, the name just a ploy and how it entered the market, some shady shit.
"I can understand how you've come to that view given the stories that circulate  social media, but it's really not true. The Bitcoin Cash fork originated from *within* the Bitcoin community after years of debate about what Bitcoin should be and how it should scale. Those who favoured Satoshi's big block scaling model were locked out of development by individuals who censored discussion forums and revoked developer access to the code base. 

Bitcoin Cash was created by this exiled faction. I don't believe that the idea of ""Bitcoin"" is anybody's to police, nor is it Core’s to ruin. The people in *this* community \(the original big\-block bitcoiners\) have as much right to work on ensuring the success of Satoshi’s idea as anyone else. 

Plus, tipping on reddit is what btc used to be like too. Electronic cash should be able to do that, don't you think? And who can deny that it's fun?"
"Who voted? Twitter users?

Who held the poll? Twitter? YouTube?

Bitcoin isn't a brand, it's a protocol. Whichever software implementation is able to most closely enact the protocol is considered Bitcoin. That, plus the majority accumulated PoW. There's really no further room for interpretation."
What vote are you refering to?
It's great that the supporters of the censors are allowed to expose their faces on our open forum. 
Which is also sold at kombini!
"Okay, but it's not up to the small blockers to decide what the big blockers can do, that was the whole point of finally parting ways with the hard fork. 

Anyway honestly, the name Bitcoin Cash is the least thing Bitcoin \(BTC\) has to worry about right now. The biggest problem is that they are still waiting on a solution to processing more than 4\-7 tx per second."
Soon can mean a lot of things. Anyway, lots of people on this sub living in Tokyo already, you'll hear of it if there is actually anything big going on.
Yes he's building a wall in the sky and  in the ocean. That'll teach us!
Thank God that BCH is getting the light it deserves! I'm expecting downvotes, but fuck it these days.
Meanwhile Core peeps are immersed in the surrealist Beckett play, *Waiting for Lightning.*
"Here is a Japanese article discussing this as well. They didn't give many more details either, but the article doesn't express any skepticism either. Only time will tell, but looks promising:

https://dialog-news.com/2018/06/03/bch0603/"
I really can’t wait for bch to take over litecoin in transactions per day! I can’t believe litecoin gets more! Hopefully this will change soon with this announcement. 
cool!  i get everything i need from the local convenience store.
I can't wait to buy my half egg salad half tuna sandwich with BCH.
Lol that retard gave up american citizenship for japanese one
Actually we do pay all bills at convenience stores in Taiwan. Digital currency is kept on cards and have access all over the island. From public transport, taxis supermarkets etc! I see this a just another method of payment. In Japan, this will be the tsunami of open regulations that other Asian countries will hav ego adopt or be left behind! I’m very optimistic! 
"You can't pay all bills at the combini, and for whatever reason you can't pay any bill any way you want. For example I can't use card to pay my utility bills.

Still cool that you may be able to pay for your groceries and whatnot though."
">Huh? The fact that they take many non-crypto payment methods doesn't at all detract from how hugegigantic this is, if true.

Not really, it won't be a true system, it'll just be a tie-in with an exchange, maybe several, in the same way that Bic Camera allows bitcoin payments, but only from a wallet on the bitFlyer exchange.

You absolutely cannot pay for things like utility bills, Amazon purchases, plane tickets, concert tickets etc with alternative methods - it's only cash. And it will always be only cash.

This will just allow you to buy other stuff like food and drinks with BCH. Which honestly is nice, but not that big a deal."
If this is true they'll be accepting BTC and ETH the day after lol
"This is *huge* for me. Don't forget you can add funds to your **pasmo/suica** there too. Many taxis accept these.

So that's:

- **rail and Subway and taxi transport**
- utility bills
- Amazon
- food, drink, etc
- all those **gift cards** sold at kombini (iTunes, playstore, Amazon, etc)

"
sounds smart to get out before Trump builds the wall to keep everyone in
You may head back to r/bitcoin now.
[deleted]
True. Except, it won’t be anonymous because there is cctv in most convenience stores. 
"> you can add funds to your pasmo/suica there too

i didn't know that"
An online service that lets you fund your pasmo/suica cards with BCH would also be a great idea.
Ah the romantic meeting of a pimp and an explosives dealer on international soil, the thing that dreams are made of. El Meow.
same reason you still come here and post bullshit
