Well, at least it says Blockchain,  and not DAG..  that's a plus. 
"It is setting a chain of PoW that solved consensus.

It is not semantics, PoW on its own achieved nothing, the proof is it existed decades before bitcoin.. and it was not for the lack of trying."
"I assure you that I understood the idea you wanted to convey by your example, that's why asked you: ""Think twice about this"". 

You are not looking to this example with objectiveness. If Apple affect the App devloppment/production, there is no use to ask: ""how"" neither ""how far"". the principle is verified: the result is they affect what apps should/shouldn't exist on their ecosys. the difference between them and the etherium case expressed here, is that Apple do it poste-app production (the store) for a pragmatic reasons (filtering without affecting the production/diversification/apps offer, and filling themselves the main markets like Music with iTune, and handling the critical aspects like with the security concerns) and etherium [need] to do it in backend (at the foundry, the core) for an efficiency reason: productivity, as key features on chosen set of core implemented apps have high potential to be exploited by majority of other future apps.

Personally, i am with an intermediary vision between : they should implement features like framework on classic devlopment world and let devs exploit them. thus, the final ""state"" will not be affected, devs will be free to devlop any app they want (it make me think about Internet Neutrality ^^ ) , and the whole ecosys will be more productive with these core implemented/abstracted features or what one can label them..

I think that the core implementation of ""feature"" (apps, frameworks, modules, extensions.... ? other than the protocols themselves) levrage the whole blockchain ecosystem (adoption, productivity, devs ""enrolment"", creativity...), the Apple example (objectively taken) is not necessary the only goal motivating such choice. i am tempted to point Google example for that: they are Apple + myEtheriumVision (Map, Sheet, Google Tag Manager....). they affect what should/shoudn't exist on their managed ecosystem (Android, Adsence...) AND they facilitate/boost the development of apps/solution by the implementation of the useful ""basic bricks"" (basic apps) at the Core level (arround the fundamental ""Search"" business).

I strongly beleive that doing so, the implementation of a  ""Click & Pay"" will be as ""intuitive"" in crypto as it is on classic money world. Actually, we are dealing with fundamental concerns like this one, while everyone here is eager to reach a minimum of maturity for public use. that's why a ""Xcoin Pay"" (Coinbase Merchant ?) feature is still a blockchain/cryptobusiness marketing argument ! Etherium can (is a good candidat) go a step forward by enriching its core design."
