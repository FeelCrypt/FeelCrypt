The poor won't have Bitcoin Cash unless you give them some of yours. Never forget this. 
Fraud protection for sellers! Business owners won't have to deal with chargebacks. Escrow will still be needed but with n to m transactions at least the escrow guy can not steal funds anymore. The rest is still like the old system. So now business owners have to systems to work with and combine together. Satoshi never ever said: oh we will kill all banks and end fiat.

"Is there a source for this?

Are you saying that if I buy a share of AAPL on Robinhood versus E-Trade or something, I would get a worst spread on RH?"
And correct me if I'm wrong but they also make money arbitraging the bid-ask spread by matching buyers with sellers on their own platform. I think all stock exchanges do this, why send the trade to the NYSE if it can be done on the platform.
How is that shady? It's just offering a different payment plan for people who don't want to pay per transaction. Increasing the spread allows people with small orders to pay by percentage instead of per # of transactions. 
Where is this guy getting his info from? This would be a major bummer.

Live in your delusion, troll. The free market is far more rational.
"Your missing out the key part, “opt in”. 

Full rbf does break 0 conf as then any unconfirmed transaction can be replaced by one with a higher fee. 

Opt in rbf is where a miner will only accept the double spend attempt with the higher fee if the transaction has the “rbf flag”. This means that transactions without the “rbf flag” will still be accepted or rejected on a first seen basis. A merchant accepting 0 conf would make sure that if they saw the rbf flag, then they would wait for at least 1 confirmation. 


Not trying to defend RBF, it was stupid in the first place, just pointing out the difference between full and opt in rbf. "
We care about adoption and usability, price will follow. 
All latest Bitpay blog posts talk about Bitcoin Cash, so full BCH support is due to be launched any time. This will lead to huge shift in crypto markets and price will reflect that.

Who are Bitpay's competitors?
Just to be completely true. RBF was never shitcode per se. It was simply a feature that hadn't any useful value. It has always been there... also in the original bitcoin code. It was disabled early in development by satoshi and later enabled in february 2016 for bitcoin core. A big mistake for sure for 0-confirmations I agree.
"But BCash = ฿0.14376

Fuck off, you silly Ver buggering buggers with your faux positive comments about your crooked altcoin!"
"Opt in RBF does not affect the viability of 0 conf, although it is still a stupid “feature” 

What killed it was full blocks which meant that any attempt to estimate the probability of a transaction getting confirmed went out the window. 

There is always a risk with 0 conf (and N conf for that matter!), I just hope they have optimised their systems to try mitigate this risk and use 0 conf. "
Why so angry? Real cryptocurrency (BCH) is getting adopted and used by millions of merchants and end-customers. That's great right?

I'm bringing up Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash to show that incomplete isn't the same as a toy implementation. It's not incredibly buggy, although you can encounter them and it's not considered safe.

I guess it depends on what you consider more important in LN. If you think the routing is all that is interesting, sure, the fact that the routing is still very bad ruins the whole thing. But I think the other features of LN (instant transactions that are secure without going on-chain) are also very interesting and those _are_ working and are at roughly Alpha stage. "
">And that doesn't need to scale to the same number of transactions?

> The difference is thst Japan has accumulated that debt 'slowly' since 91/92 up until 2013.

This is a key difference, thank you for pointing it out. But I do still believe that the amount of debt with relation to the GDP is dependent several factors, so I'll include this in my analysis next time I get around to it. My main point is that right now in the US and Europestan, the banks are foreign with respect to the countries they operate in.

To your last point, the amount of wealth a country can generate for another country is the leading metric to which that countries debt can accumulate. So, the US, having the petrodollar and largest military, is a fairly secure bet for the future. Sweden, only having the the umbrella of the EU is a more risky bet. Financial interests seem to invest where the return on their investment is safer. Greece, having low production and high liability is a considered a risky venture with low possible reward. In other words, the best way for a country to secure loans in the future is to have something to offer as well as more security on those returns than the competition.


Thank you for you thoughts. They have helped me see the way this fiat scam works in a different light.

"On point number 5 not really. In some circumstances yes but generally speaking not really. 

If the bank collapse is small and isolated then what happens is the insurer bails out the bank this comes form money the banks contributed to the issuer. If there is a systemic failure in the banking system then the central bank will just print money put of thin air and use that to bail out the bank. No tax dollars are spent there rather you pay for it though inflation. It's only likley that your taxes go to bailing out the banks if you're country doesn't have its own central bank and thus doesn't control this monetary supply and the central bank that does refuses to print fiat out of thin air, like the Euro zone example in which Greece can't print money out of thin air because they don't control the ECB.

I said power. Violence isn't the only means to exert power just like money isn't the only thing used to exchange goods. "
If the bank goes belly up and FDIC isn't enough it's unlikely your taxes bail them out. When '08 happened taxes didn't go to bailing out the banks rather the Fed just printed money out of thin air and used that to bail out the banks. 
"I'm not using the bank to buy crypto, dear god. I'm using the bank services of *transfer* my own money to a crypto exchange. How difficult is to understand that? How can a bank FFS deny me transferring money to, say, coinbase? A fully insured regulated cryptobank? It makes no fucking sense.

"They are very correlated things. If that was so easy we wouldn't need taxes, public services would be paid by a centrally controlled money printer. Why it isn't that way?

Because taxes, like interest rates, are a form to dry out the liquidity banks flood the market with in the form of debt creation. In this sense I'm surely paying for their operation."
Because buying crypto is a choice (behaviour) it is not discrimination being conducted by the banks.  The bank is private property.  You can't demand that you be able use that property to service your choices.  That is not how society works.

Can a business, open to general public, profile costumers so that they don't serve based on nonfactual allegations, or plain prejudice?

I'm not claiming it is an easy topic or ""black or white"" sort of situation, but it seems to me appalling how some americans, who live in a country pride to be free, are indoctrinated to accept the big capital screwing them over just because they are a ""private business"".

And this issue has nothing to do whatsoever with this republican x democrat dichotomy, or SJW, or liberals, or whatever the label."

The difference is thst Japan has accumulated that debt 'slowly' since 91/92 up until 2013. From 50% to 240%, where every 100% took about ten years. 

Sweden has managed to stay below 70% during the same period with a mean of around 50%. It currently sits at 44% and is declining but, If it were to add 80% to its debt-to-GDP in just 1-3 years it would be like the case of greece, which went from 100% in -08 to 170% in -11.
