"> An elite group or a system is currently needed,

That may be true, but the question is whether we have to have an elite group forced on us, or whether we might be able to choose our elites and follow them willingly. Either version provides a viable elite group.

In the economy, elites prove their mettle by running companies and producing products that people want. The same can be done in terms of legal choice and elites in a voluntary private scenario.

> the current system is based on us selecting representatives for our community to sit in a government. 

Yes, representative elites chosen through majoritarianism. Elites who then produce law.

However, the ability to choose law can be redistributed from these elites to individuals, allowing them to choose elites by deciding who to patronize, based on merit instead of votes.

> The problem is how it is organized and the checks and balances behind it.

This creates an automatic check and balance system, because it essentially gives each individual a *veto* over all law. There's no possible greater system of checks and balance than the customer-provider model of the market.


> 
> 
> 
> What is another system? True democracy does not work, a system based on machine? How does that represent what the people want? 

Obviously the market works pretty well to give people what they want. So produce a market for law and the same will be true.

> You also have a significant population who is illiterate on alot of subjects from trade to economics and then military and social policies.

People are illiterate on a lot of engineering topics too, yet they manage to buy cars and houses. Because they observe both trusted reviews, reviews from many buyers and the wisdom of crowds, and they see the results other people are getting. Then they choose for themselves, and it works pretty well, even for big decisions like buying a new car.

That's better than relying on majoritarianism which is subject to rational ignorance of voters.

> If you relied on the average person, there will never be any clear direction as people are inherently reactionary leading to a change of direction in overall policy alot more often than normal. This becomes highly inefficient and can lead to some bad results.

Over time, people figure it out based on results being achieved, no matter what, ***as long as they have options***.

Most of what the government does is create one law and force it on everyone, so we never have opportunity to see how other results are coming out for other people, at least not in our country.



> 
> 
> 
> The second problem is how do we decide when laws should be changed,

Let individuals choose which they want to subscribe to and when, let those same laws contain a process for getting rid of them and choosing another law-set.

> and how does one write and propose it. A bill is not just some simple law it has alot of detail and legal speak behind it.

I think it would likely be much like how open-source software works now. Law is basically a legal operating system. Get a bunch of lawyers together and have them produce a cohesive package of law, and sell it to buyers, or give it away and earn fees training lawyers and judges in that system of law or taking a cut of every lawsuit conducted under it.

> 
> 
> 
> But ignoring all that, whatever system we create there will always be the elite, as they will always have control on which direction to go and how the system is set up.

If we walk outside existing jurisdictions, via seasteading for instance, then there's no elite at all and we can build from zero.

The only elite needed are like that group of lawyers to create legal packages for others to consume.

> Also because people want someone to show them the way. 

Sure, but again, it can be voluntarily chosen.

> Why people in China are content with a dictatorship and and having less rights, all because they can live content and not have to care about certain issues.

If they had a choice, they'd likely choose otherwise. Chinese dictatorship persists because it's not so disruptive that they feel the need to get rid of it. The Chinese psychology is that the communist party is annoying but is better than the chaos likely if they tried to get rid of it right now. It's an old society, they understand the need for political stability more than most.

"well sure, depending on what you mean by ""start a charity""

i've been thinking that it's a weakness how when we do projects we try to consolidate all the donations to one place, that's a weak point

so i've been thinking we should organize projects and have people pledge funds to the projects and *keep holding those funds themselves* and then when the project collectively decides to make a purchase *then* call on the people holding the funds to make the necessary payment

pretty sure people would also be more generous in committing funds to such a project lol

so like instead of collecting a bunch of money in a particular wallet and supposedly it's going to go to giving out basic tech to get people onto the internet and hopefully it's not wasted or stolen, instead we just take commitments and then when we have a purchase we can make to get some tech to someone we call on the committed people to realize their commitments "

Well iOS actually fluctuates around 12-18% so let’s say it’s about 15% of the marketshare. Cell phone adoption is around 96% of the population. Let’s exclude not smart phone owners so that’s about 7 Billion people using a cell phone meaning that 1,050,000,000 people would be using iOS. That’s a lot of people unable to use the service and if you consider leaving them out makes it a game changer than we have a different understanding of what “game changer” is. 
Once again not a game changer because it’s not on iOS... If it was cross platform then that would change the game. Meaning anyone in the world could transact with anyone else over text. Instead you’re limit to android users

"> HODL doesn't apply to alt Coins

You say that as if it's a bad thing. In BTC everyone just sits on their virtual Scrooge McDuck pool and is content with price increases, not caring so much about the underlying technology.

So my opinion is that you are both right and wrong depending on how you or I specifically define the terms and context that you are using.

Also..  I don't care enough to write out long streams of text to clarify that.  So I made an intentionally vague and concise statement to voice my opinion on the subject."

Looking at your post history you were and often do. You also bash the bitcoin mods and the bitcoin sub. You come off as a low effort troll. 

One.     
>They promote it as bitcoin as its closer to the whitepaper than btc is and it is a fork in the network

>Since no one owns ""Bitcoin"", I'm pretty sure they arent technically lying    


Two.    
>no, most opinions as in

>almost anything you post will not be removed, however it may be downvoted, unlike here where posts that speak kindly of BCH are actually removed (as well as downvoted).

>This place literally blocks pro BCH content, r/btc will downvote but rarely ever remove posts.

>/r/btc's extreme bias is 100% a byproduct of this place's censorship

>You're acting as if this place isnt at all like /r/btc (but opposite opinion wise) while it is actually worse

>downvotes dont stop people from commenting and reading, but mods removing posts do



Three.   
>This sub literally bans you for posting controversial things and doesnt allow posts about BCH claiming its an ""altcoin"" but then allows people to post shitting all over it, how is that delusional 


Four.  
>On r/btc most people like BCH because BCH supporters are pushed away from here, not because of the sub itself

>This place pushes an agenda way more as it actually removes posts all the time that talk about BCH, Block size changes, and other things. Yet is totally 100% okay with posts about those topics when they're saying how bad they are

>r/btc is mostly about BCH but at least its because of the voting system on reddit and not the mods removing BTC related posts

"No check the repo ffs. Looking at a bunch of fans and idealogues discussing Bitcoin on a forum is not the same as paying attention to the specific developers who actually contribute and how they resolve issues (or for another matter who actually commits the most frequently/meaningfully). That's what decides where Bitcoin goes at the end of the day; that was agreed to by Satoshi as well very clearly but people are suddenly selectively emphasizing things he said and omitting others on this sub (which we all want  to feel important and get lambos, but Reddit participation/politics means nothing if we're not investing our own time into development on the real source code)."
"Exactly my point. What you people would do in /r/bitcoin is akin to spam, trolling, concern trolling and anything to spread your altcoin. So why wouldnt you be censored?  
No one is brigading you here so you dont need to."

">&gt;It very likely BCH will be much more resistant to corporate capture because it is the very reason it splitted in the first place.

>How in gods name do you come to that conclusion when you claim that a freakin SUBREDDIT (a freakin subreddit!!!) has the power to change consensus and remove its censorship resistance? 

All major Bitcoin media were own by the same guy.

His decision to apply strong censorship to de-rail the project had absolutely a major effect on the BTC project.

It is media centralisation that has led to major BTC change and ultimately the split.

BCH media are against censorship.

This is not guarantee BCH cannot be captured by corporate interest but it certainly make it harder.

And without crippled block limit, can you explain how a corporation would managed to capture BCH?

(And you are confusing Bitcoin censorship resistance and Bitcoin capture by business interest, this is not the same thing)

>Are you that naive that you think r/btc mods are not corruptible and won't run into the same issue? Come on, you can't be serious. 

Rbtc have open moderation log.

It is enough for me to demonstrate their willingness to remain as transparent as possible.

>You even said yourself that bcash is as c-restistance as any transparent any transparent blockchain, yet you claim bitcoin isn't anymore so what gives?

They both have the same censorship resistance, obviously.

What happened to Bitcoin is corporate interest captured dev and used their influence to prevent any blocksize increase while offering commercial sidechain.

>All right dude, Bitcoin wasn't perfect to begin with by the very least. Satoshi didn't have the solution to many issues that came over the years. Neither BCH nor BTC are what BTC was when it was first designed and you know that.

Bitcoin was never designed to work on small blocks/ high fees.

This is not about issue, this a major economic/incentive design change.

BCH return to the original network characteristics."
Are you assuming that Roger have a leading role in the development of Bitcoin Cash? If so you pretty misinformed. Roger is an investor and have not taken any role in the development process.
"> What you people would do in /r/bitcoin is akin to spam, trolling, concern trolling and anything to spread your altcoin.

I guess we're talking about 2 different things here. I'm talking about the censorship that occurs at r/bitcoin, not the removal of spam/trolling/shilling.

> No one is brigading you here so you dont need to.

We're being constantly brigaded, maybe you have my been here much?"
Hahaha I am 12 Cash :p
You enjoy scamming people into buying bch instead of BTC ?
No dude I know ver isn’t s fucking DEV... he’s the freakin marketing king. Is it not OBVIOUS to you that Ver actively touts bcash??? And we know cash hasn’t had any significant dev update since it’s inception anyway... the trolling here is outrageous... I’m done.. unless you’re legit serious  
"Oh you're brigaded, from where? 

I'm here a lot now that i know how infested it is. It's like farming downvotes, defending technologies that make the world a better place. It's really strange.  
"
if i keep replying will you keep replying
LOL What do you think happens to eth when Vitalik does? What do you think happens to Litecoin when Charlie Lee dies? They will go down dramatically in price. The lower in altcoins you go the more centralized the coin becomes being susceptible to the literal health of the team associated with it. Bitcoin is the only one that doesn’t have such a staunch connection to a team. If a bitcoin core dev dies it doesn’t affect bitcoin one bit. Maybe bcash won’t go to zero but without the actual leader in place it’s all downhill. Bcash needs Ver to keep pushing the agenda otherwise it won’t organically grow the way bitcoin did that took years to happen. Do you not see this? It’s like everyone has drank the fucking koolaid on this sub. I’m sorry you are so fucking sensitive and pissy just because r/bitcoin has mods that ban people. Wahhh wahhh wahhh... as if this sub is not going to run the same fate if it was rife with power and control which is the crux of human nature. The people in this sub live in an alternate world that think bcash won’t run into the same issues for some reason cause the mods are transparent here LOL 
"You could say the same about ethereum classic and ethereum

Except people dont say that because people arent stupid

If someones investing a ton of money, they are gonna pay at least a little bit of attention as to where their money is going"
"> No dude I know ver isn’t s fucking DEV

Good.

>he’s the freakin marketing king.

He does a well job at promoting the real bitcoin just like he did in the past before we forked blockstream away. Indeed. 

>we know cash hasn’t had any significant dev update since it’s inception anyway

Well you know jack shit apparently. Your loss.

"Right, just like how Apple fell apart when Steve Jobs died. 

Wait, no, they’re actually doing better than ever since his passing. "
"You mean r/btc? Defending technologies that make the world a better place.

We're being brigaded by the people behind the takeover of core and r/bitcoin, and have been being brigaded for nearly a year now. (New account, old account is /u/PsyRev)"
"Indeed ;) "
lol 
Do you even know how to read?  When you rip off a logo and use the same fucking name bitcoin.com instead of Bitcoin cash.com and clean to sell Bitcoin while you're selling another currency. Is that fair? Is that ethical? Is that business or scamming people? 
Yes the resemblance that's called scamming, did you know that? It's like Chinese brands selling iPone as iPhone. capiche?
"i sold my bitcoin to buy bitcoin cash.
no one scammed me. It was a considered, conscious choice. 
We are all adults, here. At least, we are supposed to be."
lol equating apple to a cryptocurrency that's supposed to be decentralized
"You really arent, youre just doing the old ""he said, she said"" redditaroo "
I just want to point out how so many people (majority) are excited and willing to switch to the green, tilted back B, and Dollar bill shaped logo in order to differentiate themselves from BTC
What?
Yeah ignorant newbies..
I think BTC is resembling Bitcoin less as time goes on and they should probably rename their experiment for clarity
That's your answer?
This guy implemented oracles on BCH? BULLISH!
Sure like scamming newbies right?
Bad bot
That “not” should not be there. I meant to say what makes you think bcash IS resistant to censorship...? Bcash is literally a fork of BTC.. and this subs claim is often that bitcoin has lost censorship resistance due to r/bitcoin shenanigans.. well if Btc is so fucking weak that a sub can remove those qualities, what makes you even remotely think bcash is infallible to the same fate ? /u/9inety9ine this question is for you “mate” telling me to stick to pushups.
What do you think happens to bcash when Ver dies? 
"That's just propaganda. Otherwise please explain why most of the original developers are working on BTC (the actual BTC listed in exchanges), and not BCash? I know I am getting down voted for this, but I also know it's also due to cognitive dissonance so I have sympathy for the people who will be losing their money as BCash development continues to lag behind (for real scalable solutions vs just hard forking and keeping the same insane O(n) solution that always either runs into a brick wall or compromises feasibility in less developed countries).

Edit: Apparently nobody replying was actually here during the beginning of BTC and paid attention or has common sense to check the repo contributions and discussion between the real developers actually contributing; just regurgitating a bunch of bullshit from a ghetto forum."
I think there are definitely unscrupulous ones there, but overall, govt is still better than lawlessness and anarchy. Govt is a creation by humans out of need (how else do you get highways?) and it is the foundation of every great civilization. No anarchical society has ever succeeded.
So the entire post by u/singulary87 was a lie?
"Every sub is ""censored"". Reddit wouldnt be readable otherwise.  
Spam/astroturfing/doxxing/witch hunts/personal attacks... the list goes on.  
If i created 10 accounts and downvoted every single post here i wouldnt be shadowbanned? lol"
"I think subreddits should be decentralized and the community should be allowed to replace moderation, not the other way around. Or at least have multiple forks of the communities. 

Like it or not but brand is just too powerful on reddit, you can't just fork subreddit with a slightly different name and expect to get the community."
A user should not be banned from a subreddit for their posts on another subreddit.
Ah OK. I thought when you said BTC, you meant r/btc. Apologies.
You're being a goof
It's a private company, they can do what they want. Don't be a fascist.
"Literally everything i said was true

Why are we at a point where saying negative true things is labeled ""trolling""

Also none of that was promoting BCH"
">It very likely BCH will be much more resistant to corporate capture because it is the very reason it splitted in the first place.

How in gods name do you come to that conclusion when you claim that a freakin SUBREDDIT (a freakin subreddit!!!) has the power to change consensus and remove its censorship resistance? Are you that naive that you think r/btc mods are not corruptible and won't run into the same issue? Come on, you can't be serious. You even said yourself that bcash is as c-restistance as any transparent any transparent blockchain, yet you claim bitcoin isn't anymore so what gives?

>It is, by all objective measures, Bitcoin as it was first designed.

All right dude, Bitcoin wasn't perfect to begin with by the very least. Satoshi didn't have the solution to many issues that came over the years. Neither BCH nor BTC are what BTC was when it was first designed and you know that."
You mean you hate gold, right?
">That “not” should not be there. I meant to say what makes you think bcash IS resistant to censorship...? 

Well Bitcoin cash is just as censorship resistant as any transparent blockchain.

Miner can collude to orphan a block including your tx.

So both BTC AND BCH are as censorship resistant as mining is decentralised (if mining is decentralised miner cannot collude to orphan a block they don’t like).



>Bcash is literally a fork of BTC.. 

**Bitcoin cash** is a split to return to original characteristics, it is not just a fork.

It is, by all objective measures, Bitcoin as it was first designed.

>and this subs claim is often that bitcoin has lost censorship resistance due to r/bitcoin shenanigans.. 

Rbitcoin helped change Bitcoin characteristics and goal against community consensus.

>well if Btc is so fucking weak that a sub can remove those qualities, what makes you even remotely think bcash is infallible to the same fate ?

BCH is the result that situation.

It is not rare open source project split when the project go off rail.

It very likely BCH will be much more resistant to corporate capture because it is the very reason it splitted in the first place.

"What does any of that have to do with a currency system?

I'm just not seeing how 100% public and open source currency systems would affect ""muh roads"" in any way.

Apparently you have a lot of faith in the concept of government, which is fair.  I have a lot of faith in individuals and humanity in general.  But those are personality traits, not data.

The point I am making is that there are more unscrupulous people in government because that is where they have more power.  And in regards to the specific subject of cryptocurrency, people in government have a lot more ability to be harmful and unscrupulous than private individuals are able to.  Including very rich people.  Yes, those people can buy off and exert control over governments, but if the government doesn't have the legislative or constitutional ability to do something then using that tool isn't going to help them much."
"I was referring to your post.

Wow how is that even the same thing as censorship?
"You've mistaken moderation for censorship. Spam/doxxing/personal attacks are valid reasons for a post removal and perhaps a ban depending on the circumstances. Banning for supposed astroturfing/Witch hunts is nonsense, there is a vote system to ensure the front page is clear of any poor quality post, such as yours.

Ok so imagine it if every fork of BTC was allowed to be discussed in full on the forum. How healthy would the discussion be? It would be polluted with talk about alternate forks (some good some bad). Where would discussion about main chain go? 
It’s kinda the same for both groups 
"The reason is written there. you were lying
"
Looks like you made the mistake of promoting an altcoin on a bitcoin subreddit. If you want to promote BCH you could try doing that on a bch subreddit. You don't see ether or zcash lovers promoting their coin on /r/bitcoin do you? Why would you think it was okay to promote bch?
"TBH I can be okay with this.

BCH is another bitcoin fork in the process of failing. Dropped 40 percent vs BTC since it's inception.

I usually don't care about alt coins, but people were claiming BCH was bitcoin. That's fraudulent.

Also Circle Pay never gave me BCH. So I'd never support it.

Is there a place you can talk about bitcoin and bcash, as well as eth and all the others, without some Reddit knight getting panties in wads lol?

/r/btc needs to be careful of falling into this trap too. While I haven't seen anyone banned yet, there are *many* people here who repeat anti-core rhetoric just as poorly as /r/bitcoin repeats anti-BCH rhetoric. I encourage those people to be the bigger person and not engage in petty name calling. Why can't we all just be pro-crypto and discuss the actual technology?"
I have yet for that to happen to me, but I also don't participate there near as much
That used to be the standard two years back. Then rbtc got too big and they couldn't do it so often. 
Guess I’ve been lucky, maybe it’s because they recognize that I’m still new to all of this because I ask questions on both sides 
That happened to me.

"The Bitcoin sub has very strict rules and if people breach them sooner or later they will be pinged. Discussion is Bitcoin only, not alts not forks. And no posts that are designed to provoke or cause trouble. This was invoked a few years ago to stop the madness that broke out about the XP proposal, lots of threats and bullying which are strictly against Reddit rules. So the forum admin had to do something, people ignored the repeated warnings so then he brought down some strict rules.  Some people call that censorship because it suits their agenda, some people are more moderate and see it as strict moderation. 

These days the Bitcoin sub is largely free from the trouble makers and this is a direct result of the strict rules.

Honestly... I'm feeling a little left out by not being banned over there yet
The idea of a decentralized solution controlled by the few. This is an oligarchy. If one person is so intent on controlling one thing, they surely capitulated themselves if quantum computing comes along  to override Bitcoin's scalling problem.

"Question for the Bitcoin Community - As part of my college course I am currently enrolled in a module much of which is centered around the history of bitcoin . I am completely new to the world Bitcoin and still finding my feat in terms of understanding everything so please go easy on my below post in terms of things that may be wrong or dont fit with your views on bitcoin . As part of the course we are currently looking at the difference between bitcoin and bitcoin cash - if you've a few minutes read the below and let me know whats right and wrong and what else I need to know about the split in the community in terms of parties working in both communities , issues and solutions to both parties ideas. 

I appreciate any feedback you could give. 

Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash
August 2017 we saw the creation of a hard fork from Bitcoin’s original blockchain ledger. The fork was created as a result of a debate that caused a split into the bitcoin community. The debate was centered around the issue of scalability in the bitcoin blockchain . The following outlines below what I believe to be the arguments presented by both users of Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash on how best to solve the scalability issue . Open to any corrections of details people may have on either sides arguments . 

The Issue of Scalability.

Under satoshis original whitepaper for Bitcoin we know that individual’s transactions are grouped together to form blocks. Each block has its own blockhash made up of four key components 
1)	The Hash of the previous block 
2)	A time stamp of the new block 
3)	The merkle tree root hash which is the method by which transaction are bundled together from the transaction slush pool  with the first transaction hash in the bunch being the coinbase of that bundle . 
4)	Nonce – This is the puzzle minors need to solve in order to complete the block . To solve the puzzle requires brut computing force so minors must expend computer processing power to find the value randomly that satisfies the puzzle. Upon finding the value the blocks hash is then complete and at this point the block is added to the blockchain .

When a block is added to the blockchain a miner ie the person whos cpu solved the nonce to create the block is rewarded in two ways – 1stly with the issue of newly minted bitcoin  and 2ndly with all the transaction fees that people wishing to send bitcoin transactions to attach to their transactions . 

The issue with scalability surrounding the blockchain prior to August 2017 was that each block could had a maximum blocksize of 1MB which allowed for roughly 250,000 transaction per day to be processed . The issue was that as more and more people began to use the Bitcoin network it began to run slower as users who were unwilling to pay higher fees had to wait longer for their transactions to be added from the slush to a block and confirmed . How to solve this issue of scalability in the blockchain is what ultimately lead to the forking of the blockchain in August 2017 and the creation of Bitcoin Cash .

Bitcoins solution to scalability – 
Bitcoins solution to its scalability issue include the creation of both Segregated Witness ( Segwit ) and lightning protocols. Segwit was introduced to increase the blockchain blocksize from 1mb to a maximum of 4mb with the current protocol allowing for blocks to be 2mbs in size . Segwit also allowed for the creation of layered networks on the bitcoin protocol that will ultimately lead into the adoption of the lightning network . 

The lightening network is a way in which payments can be chained together outside of the blockchain. It works by allowing participants to transactions interact only twice with the blockchain ledger , once to open and once to close a set of transaction . In-between the opening and closing participants enforce digital IOUs against one another with either party having the option to end the current transaction string of IOUs and cash out for the balancing amount . 

Bitcoin Cash’s Solution to scalability . 
Bitcoin Cash creators changed bitcoins protocol such that the block size was increased from 1Mb to 8MB thus allowing for more transactions to be confirmed in each block helping the network to run quicker . 

If you owned Bitcoin prior to August 1st 2017 you also own Bitcoin Cash ( I Think) . Because the chains forked I think so do the public and private key address in the underlying system which means if you sign into a wallet that supports bitcoin cash you’ll find some which at the time I wrote this was roughly 952 USD per coin . Is this correct? 

Thanks for all your feedback."
"FUCK THEM GOOFS. banned me too. twitch.tv/btc1 im a real person not a bot.

"I finally unsubbed /r/bitcoin after reading the comments on the ""BCH is a scam"" article on medium."
What about BTCP, can we talk about that?

"OP, you obviously said something they don't agree with.

I myself am not sure if what I just said is a joke or not."
Moderators there are nazis 
"It's pretty obvious what you did... you were spreading some kind of ""BCH is the real BTC"" bullshit.

If you're a noob, ask questions and make it clear you are a noob. If people sense even remotely that you are concern trolling or shilling, you'll get banned. Rightly so, since it's against the rules."
"You are clearly a lying BCH shill as per the moderator's comment. I, for one, welcome you to our community. You should fit right in.

That is quite an achievement. Then again I was banned only a year or so ago.
"That was the TLDR ;-)

Sorry, but if you have even a penny invested in crypto, every word on that link is well worth your time, and then some.

You want it shorter? Ok, here goes. Bitcoin BTC was taken over thanks to a coordinated social attack."
Bitcoin Cash is the real bitcoin though. Banning someone for telling the truth is pretty fucking absurd.
It is a gray world.   All those things are true, yet often false.
"The difference is that you won't be banned. You might be downvoted to oblivion, but that is completely different than deleting comments completely.

Reddit works on the upvote/downvote system. It has its flaws, but it's still far different from actual censorship.

If /r/bitcoin created stickied threads to discuss controversial topics instead of just deleting every one that comes in, it'd be a far better place.

But once communities become so large, they become undesirable anyway. It's another flaw of online forums / reddit."
"All it takes is one person clicking on your profile and BOOM, you're gone.

True. It would be full of voting bots and blatant targetted anti-bitcoin propaganda. Great job guys :D
Doesn't include any content the massive amount of people like me who are banned would post. Also no content from those who would post in reply or contributing to genuine discussions and who likely don't even read it anymore.

Edit: Advantage: Chaintip returns the unclaimed tips. Quite a few, maybe a third of the tippees don't bother to claim. I can understand them, addressing the public is not easy, as anyone in sales can confirm.

Edit2: Claim means inform chaintip of the tippees preferred receiving address, called linked address. Subsequent tips to the same person goes quasidirect - it is immediately relayed to his linked address."
It also means more BCH traffic on-chain - your support on display.
I was being sarcastic. Wasn't obvious enough I guess.
"Basically they claim that any talk about scaling on-chain is an “altcoin shill”. It is censorship. Plain and simple.

This might help you to further understand:

I didn’t mean the users of r/btc. I meant the users of Bitcoin itself (ticker BTC).
I don’t really go on r/bitcoin at all anymore so I wouldn’t consider myself “such a user”.
Am I getting banned too?
"Discussing the censorship there has been a banning offence for as long as I can remember.

I guess their manipulation of the narrative only works if people don't know they're being manipulated.  Although no doubt the mods will rationalise their behaviour in some other way."
So you were banned for promoting bch in bitcoin sub. Which is against the rules, so its ok.
Bitcoin Segwit is also a (soft)fork of Bitcoin.  Irreversible.  So what?
Sounds like you were promoting bch.
Aww, pointing fingers at r/bitcoin's unreasonableness too much for you to handle?
"Fees. Tiny fees taken from the miners and into the hands of lightning network nodes.

"the circle pay thing is your own fault.

#2 dont invest more than you can affoard to lose

also remember bitcoin has died many times it will also survive this and same goes for BCH
"
What?
"You contradicted yourself. You said BCH is a fork of Bitcoin, but then you said claiming it is Bitcoin is fraud.

BTC is also a fork of Bitcoin. It is currently a soft fork, and BCH is a hard fork, but I doubt BTC can survive without a hard fork at some point in the not so distant future.

For reference. Which would you prefer for software that controls your money?

Soft fork - non updated software validates things that are no longer valid.

Hard fork - non updated software does not validate things that are now valid."

Ah quite a realization, I know.  Just remember bitcoin is now known as bitcoin cash.

I think that the lack of a proper system to participate in the decision process of the community is not decentralization it's anarchy, and true anarchy is never an equilibrium status. There is always a bunch of assholes who will declare themselves warlord of some area and take control by force. Just look in poor countries where the government structure has fallen and all you see is corruption and warlords who seized power with no one to stop them. I wish we had some of the mechanism similar to DASH. (voting for holders, voting and canceling budgets for the dev team or other projects).
Given the recent explosion and collapse of BTC prices, reading this whole story really makes me want to put on a tinfoil hat.
What happened?  I've read you for a long time and you never sounded like this.  Did someone buy or hack your account?
If it was pirates then we wouldn't have a problem since their motivation is money.  The worse things we'd have to worry about would be hacking like Mt. Gox and ethereum.  The only people that I can think of who would be motivated to destroy bitcoin would be the governments/banks.
I think the falsity is saying that bitcoin and /r/bitcoin are the same leads to false conclusions.
Watch out for shadowbanned. That's another trick they use over the wall
"> ""failing"" 

> dropped 40 percent

Do you have another way of defining ""failing"" besides price? If not, your logic is flawed; a crypto*currency* is meant to be spent and moved, making price relatively irrelevant for any coin that has decent underlying technology."

"And the Bitcoin experiment never had anything to do with settlement layer..

Edit: missing word."
">Bitcoin will have on chain transactions that are slow and cheap, fast and expensive, or layer 2.

This Bitcoin variant is (very) diferent from the original experiment.

That’s why BCH splitted apart."
By restricting onchain capacity.
"It's not, settlement layer fees too high for daily transactions, low enough for infrequent ""passage"" fees for L2."
Most of us BCH supporters also support LN and other layer 2 proposals. What we are wholly opposed to is being forced to use these layer 2 solutions by an artificial fee market resulting from a centrally planned, and excessively small block size limit.
"The intention of LN was (as far as I can tell) good, and originally fit into the whole concept of competing on merit, by adding use cases.

However, the current beast that is LN has become practically a religion and there are clearly limitations being put on Bitcoin to enforce usage.

Perhaps it would have been clearer to state that ""Attempting to use high fees to enforce usage of 2nd layer solutions like LN, is not"""
"Incidentally, I am also an early adopter from 2011. 

For me, Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin. 

I'm not happy about the squatting of the BTC ticker and the /r/bitcoin subreddit, but I don't hate it. I've diversified my coins and am optimistic about the long term future of crypto."
Negative. Bitcoin is what we want it to be. If we fork and create a new path, so be it. If we insist on strictly adhering to the ideas of a man who may not even exist, even when those ideas have been improved upon, then so be it
"Not everyone is a full node nor is it required.

Its not peer to peer.

Its certainly not peer to peer in the strictest sense of one being able to send bitcoin to another without a third party.

Any talk of staying true to some vision or whitepaper is purely horseshit."
What core devs are working on cheap, fast, on-chain transactions?

"Payment channels, yes. Limiting first layer scaling to implement it? Go ahead and show me where Satoshi, Hal Finney, or any of the rest of them said that was the path they intended.

"1) irelevant...

2) You say: ""Anyone could do it"". I say: ""Guess who DID IT!"". And yeah, those who ""did it"" claims right on fruits of their labour. Btw, where were you in 2010-2011? What did you do for bitcoin brand? You must did some major stuff back then as you are vocal enough to talk shit about people who actually did something productive and bootstraped this beautiful project!

3) This sub is open. The very fact that you said what you said proves that. There is no way in hell anyone could post such a comment on r/bitcoin about Core ""leaders""."
"1) lol you are very smart.

2) because bitcoin is not a store of value? It's a currency first? Store of value second? (You know , like real money) 

3) Prove it using ceddit.com I can find tons of examples of the subreddit you are discribing prefectly /r/bitcoin"
I just want to say that you are easily one of my favorite posters in bitcoin/btc.   I am firmly against BCC/BCH for nearly every reason you post.  I know how this comes across to this sub,  but I am always thankful to read your posts. 
I'll give you another analogy that I think better fits the narrative, and why many are upset. You walk into a store and you want your Cola-Cola, you purchase a six pack under a sign, but in the parking lot you find out it's Cola-Cola-Sugar. You take a sip and suddenly memories of the good days start flowing back. You remember what your wonderful Cola-Cola used to taste like! You go back into the store and see the other brand you had been buying for about a year now Cola-Cola. It turns out Cola-Cola replaced the sugar with corn syrup and jacked up the prices $2 per can. You never go back to buying Cola-Cola again and only buy Cola-Cola-Sugar in the hopes that one day everyone (as they should) should just call it by it's original name.
"Do you have any analysis that you can provide that backs up what you're saying? I think you're repeating a core talking point that you can't actually prove is true. Everything you're saying is relative so it sounds nice but has little substance.  Why can't ""slow and expensive"" be $0.10 per transaction? I remember when paying ten cents felt like a lot."
"The 1st one is definitely a HF , the 2nd one is arguably a HF (fixing a non deterministic critical bug that can be considered a HF depending on how you define HF's)

In any case I would agree with this statement :

>The definition that only a soft fork is no fork but a hard fork creates an alt-coin was never a good definition.

Hard forks were everyone follows the chain like in the three above examples are not creating an altcoin. The BCC HF in October where most of the community chose not to follow it is an altcoin. 

Thus the creation of another surviving blockchain is what defines an altcoin and nothing to do with HFs vs SFs , although HFs make the creation of an altcoin much more likely."

"Interesting.

"Are we still talking about bitcoin? Or general alt coins?

My Facebook group didn't seem to know this, sorry if it was obvious."
How can you force the whole network to operate on layer 2 and have a settlement layer? That's a paradox in itself. 
So then I guess you support LN. Since it's completely optional.
"> Second layer existing because fees are too high is not.

This is not why the second layer exists. It exists as it's the roadmap ideaology for one of the Dev teams. People are free to use it, not use, use the main chain, or leave BTC altogether. Development started on LN years before the blocks for full. "
We built? I don’t think you built anything. They copied bitcoin, and changed 1mb to whatever. Very innovative imo!
Both sides are dividing the community, stop being so emotional

">Neither one adheres to the white paper. Neither are really peer to peer.

This is a misunderstanding.

Read the paper. Pay strict attention to section 5 which explains in detail how to become a ""peer.""

The problem is that people don't understand who the peers are.

Edit: since when on rbtc do you get downvoted for correctly referring to the Satoshi paper SMH"
Lol it was never IP to IP. That has nothing to do with bitcoin.
"Because it’s fundamentally dishonest to deceive and defraud people?  

Then again, your dear leader Roger Ver has publicly stated that insider trading isn’t a crime, so it’s not surprising that you would follow the same logic that lying to and manipulating people for personal gain is just peachy keen!  

The fact that the bcash community are holding onto /r/btc or @bitcoin proves you are engaging in deception with the intent to defraud the less informed for your own personal gain.

Here’s a rough analogy (even if it isn’t perfect):

If I walked into a grocery store and purchased a red and white can of soda under a big advertisement for “Cola-Cola”, and then later in the parking lot when I go to open the can and find out they actually sold me something called “Coka-Cola-Soda” would I feel ripped off?  Yes, and so would anyone, because no one likes being manipulated through lies.

Even if I later found out that “Coka-Cola-Soda” was created by a small group of disgruntled ex-“Coka-Cola” employees, it doesn’t justify them highjacking the brand of the company they used to be a part of.  Just because they feel like they are the real original vision for Coka-Cola, it doesn’t make it true, nor does it mean they are entitled to use the brand.    

If you really believed in Bcash, you wouldn’t need to hijack the brand of your competitor, and you wouldn’t need to deceive the public that you are something you aren’t.

It’s in the bcash communities own self interest long term to take responsibility for the fact that you left bitcoin and recognize (even if you don’t like it) that as long as this community continues to pull shit like this, it’s not going to work out the way you want it to."
Agreed, but we were talking about a brand here right? There are actually rules when it comes to a brand.
Why do you consistently call people out for not making an argument, and then never present one yourself once it happens?
"It's not false, it's just misleading and logically flawed. Just because I helped build a brand image does not give me a right to attempt to steal that brand image in my future ventures.

That is what BCash is doing, and I think it's hard to argue. I mean you're advocating for BCH and shilling against BTC on a sub titled BTC, in which the own sidebar says is dedicated to Bitcoin (BTC). 

So no, your original statement is not false. In fact, it could even be true. It's just not really relevant to any useful discussions.

I mean Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederate States of America, was once an elected politician in the United States of America in Mississippi. Because he helped build the United States of America ""brand"" and eventually left, does that mean that the Confederate States of America was the ""real"" America? Nah."
Yes it was, stop sucking Rogers dick.
There were earlier adopters like Hal and satoshi that clearly preferred payment channels(and that is why they created them )

By this definition Bitcoin immediately became an altcoin as we never followed the whitepaper even when Satoshi was around. 
Where is BTC as a currency known as Bitcoin Core? 
"It can't be a reference client because it doesn't follow the whitepaper dev's planning and visionaire. So by definition it is no longer bitcoin. Not Satoshi's.

Only if they write a new whitepaper with changes introduced can they make it bitcoin. But there's a problem, they canned so much it is basically an altcoin, thus change of main website promises. So bitcoin core at the moment is nothing more than a hijacking of original codebase. Borgisation."
Ethereum is great for exchanging things fast and cheap so it's A+ for utility, but I worry about its depreciating model since it has no cap for tokens and is not supposed to be currency necessarily. Ie smart-contract technology. 21 million coins in BTC or BCH vs. ∞ Ether tokens. Eventually supply overtakes demand.

In argumentation theory, an argumentum ad populum (Latin for ""argument to the people"") is a fallacious argument that concludes that a proposition must be true because many or most people believe it, often concisely encapsulated as: ""If many believe so, it is so.""

This type of argument is known by several names, including appeal to the masses, appeal to belief, appeal to the majority, appeal to democracy, appeal to popularity, argument by consensus, consensus fallacy, authority of the many, bandwagon fallacy, vox populi, and in Latin as argumentum ad numerum (""appeal to the number""), fickle crowd syndrome, and consensus gentium (""agreement of the clans""). It is also the basis of a number of social phenomena, including communal reinforcement and the bandwagon effect. The Chinese proverb ""three men make a tiger"" concerns the same idea.

"You shouldn't look at the choice of keeping the block size at 1mb as being forced. If anything if we could somehow reduce that number that would be better because now you are making the network less demanding to propagate blocks in under 10 minutes. More nodes=more security and decentralization and going overkill with nodes is a good thing. Now I know BCH is only at 8mb, still small enough for cheap systems to easily propagate blocks, and really that increase is very minor and completely understand the frustration of why not just *temporarily* have it there until we find real solution to handle the enormous amount of transactions coming in the near future. Here's the issue though:
Imagine there never was a fork because they decided that, yes, we could use help with our congestion so lets raise BTC block size to 8mb. Congestion is cleared and the good old days are back. However since BTC never forked, it now has the combined transactions of BTC *and* BCH since BCH (and other forks caused from block size) doesn't exist; Everyone is still using BTC. Eventually though, and very quickly, 8mb blocks would become the new 1mb (I know it would of happened quickly because BCH already has plenty of blocks that were full). Guess what us, the users, are going to say? ""Increase the block size again!""
Eventually we would *have to* stop these increases in risk of lowering the amount of nodes in the network due to blocks becoming more demanding to propagateand giving a false sense that raising block size is the fix. There would be no change even if they did temporary size increases, we just *prolonged* the inevitable, a decision to reduce security and decentralization for the sake of fast and cheap transactions. As much as we hate to admit it, and both sides agree, block size increases are not worth leaving only people that can afford server farms to hold the nodes, Like Craig Wright wants. Even if you did agree with Mr.Wright  and decided to give up decentralization and let them decide what BTC is, Bitcoin would then have vital spots as in these server farms can now be bombed, shut down, hacked or whatever and boom, the death of Bitcoin. Always consider a block size as a defeat because no matter what we will get full again or have server farms. And when you are going to have billions of people transacting *plus* the millions of devices that will be autonomously transacting on their own, expect millions if not billions of transactions happening, per second.

I also wouldn't look at lightning as an alt coin, but more of an alt-chain. This alt chain is what is pegged to the Bitcoin network, the Bitcoin is still Bitcoin. You would then move your bitcoin to this other network to do those instant and virtually free payments. At the moment the bitcoin leave their original network, they are now technically more at risk because lightning, though will be improved and made more secure, could never beat the security of its original network. So anyone receiving these lightning payments are going to want to put those bitcoins *back* to the network and now they are safe and sound. Trust me when I say this hurts me just as much as it hurts everyone else that I can't do these transactions on Bitcoin's much safer and secure network. Still, bitcoin cant do those cool things like nano payments and streaming money without making drastic changes to Bitcoin other than block increases ultimately worsening the security of the network. That's why we need to have second-layer tools pegged to bitcoin's network like lightning."
Sorry. Is that the answer to the question. I don't understand?!

It's a cheap rhetorical move to call my position an appeal to authority, when in reality Satoshi's original design is simply the superior design. The problem is, as you've demonstrated, you don't actually understand it as Satoshi built it.

Miners are peers. They function as a virtual timestamp server, and by doing so, they disintermediate the need for any trusted third party. The system supports letting users be users.

Satoshi's design was and is still the best plan anyone ever had for a cryptocurrency, and that design is best carried forward on Bitcoin Cash.

"Think of a family tree with the trunk being the original bitcoin that existed up until 2016. With Segwit being introduced into the picture and increased centralization of the blockchain looking imminent, Bitcoin Cash was a fork away from these implementations. BTC as it is today has a mixture of Segwit and non-Segwit addresses and is becoming less like the 2016 Bitcoin every day. Bitcoin Cash is the same technology with no sidechains and no modifications, only an increased block size. Both BTC and BCH are different from what Bitcoin was. BCH is the closest match however and so it is to many people the ""real"" bitcoin. The legacy addresses that existed pre-fork however exist in the BTC chain so it's also perceived by many people as the ""real"" bitcoin. My understanding and support says that BCH *is* Bitcoin and BTC is Segwit Coin. The issue with Segwit is that transactions no longer require the private key signatures to be built into them any longer. This means that if coins ever go into a Segwit address they will forever be lacking in that complete chain of proof of ownership. Sure it's faster and more efficient, but that's because it cuts corners on safety and verifiability. BCH is affordable to use and has made no concessions on security or proof of ownership. So far Segwit works, but everything works right up until it doesn't. The more complex the machine becomes, the more likely it is to fail. This is obviously a touchy subject, but I wanted to do my best to answer your question."
"I *am* one of those people. I honestly believe that Lightning is an altcoin. It just has a price-peg with the host chain, but it acts like its own currency in every other meaningful way. If someone forces me to use this alt-coin by artificially limiting block sizes, then yeah, I'm going to have a problem calling their chain ""the real Bitcoin"".

With that being said, I do believe that alt-coins have their place in the ecosystem. If somebody wants to make a BCH-pegged lightning coin, more power to them. It really might be useful for high-frequency payments. The difference is that nobody is being *forced* to use this alt-coin, since on-chain transactions are still viable.

I'm pretty sure most other BCH folks would agree with the above position, but I could be wrong."
">&gt; As a settlement layer only.

>And whose transactions are being settled on this base layer?

If their cumulative value is enough to cover the network fee, yes."
"> It's okay if you think Bitcoin can't work as designed, just say so.

I do think Bitcoin works. I didn't see any need for BCH.

It's Roger's followers that are convinced Bitcoin needs to make bitcoin great again by following ideas that were replaced by better ones a long time ago. 

Its the logical fallacy of appealing to authority, an authority that is most likely dead and is being touted by people with their own motive. Much like how priests claim to know what God's intentions are. Its insanity. Question all authority, especially those who stand to make profit off people buying into such beliefs.

Ad hominem much?

"They should just play Satoshi dice. ;)"
Any fork off of the main blockchain is a descendant of BTC so in a way yes. However, BCH did not inherit the the FIAT values associated with investments for BTC so with the hard fork the value needs to be built up to that point. Basically the market for BCH is young, not the blockchain itself.
Most just trade and don't really give any fucks.
I thought bch was the real bitcoin. Doesn't that make it ten years old? 
I agree.

"**Ship of Theseus**

The ship of Theseus, also known as Theseus's paradox, is a thought experiment that raises the question of whether an object that has had all of its components replaced remains fundamentally the same object. The paradox is most notably recorded by Plutarch in Life of Theseus from the late first century. Plutarch asked whether a ship that had been restored by replacing every single wooden part remained the same ship.

The paradox had been discussed by other ancient philosophers such as Heraclitus and Plato prior to Plutarch's writings, and more recently by Thomas Hobbes and John Locke.

If the community eventually chooses to go to BCH, which one would be the altcoin then?

I am in agreeance with your other  point though, which is that a hard fork doesn't necessarily create an altcoin. You should tell a lot of the people in r/bitcoin that. "
Because it just isn't possible. Crypto is but an early expirament that is starting to prove itself to the world. As more and more people join the network,  more and more transactions will come. They won't just come from people,  they will come from machines as well. Billions of people will transact along with billions of devices autonomously transacting as well and not even 100gb blocks will handle the volume of transactions coming. Here's a [perfect explanation](https://youtu.be/AecPrwqjbGw) as to why raising block size is just prolonging the problem than it being an actual solution. And if you claim that BCH will add lightning as well,  then that is hypocritical to why BCH was created in the first place.

Awesome. If you give me a few moments I'll create an ethereum token that implements a blockchain starting from the geneisus block. By your definition it's a variation of bitcoin.
"Adding lightning to BCH would not be hypocritical. BCH is a permissionless system.

If you are building some high-frequency machine-to-machine micro-transaction system, you are welcome to build it in whatever way makes sense. If transactions cost a few cents, and you are sending dozens of transactions per day, you probably have a good economic incentive to use a Lightning-like system for that. Meanwhile, ordinary folks can continue to transact on-chain for their coffee or other everyday purchases, where a few cent fee makes sense.

BCH isn't about central planning or forcing people into a particular ideology. It's about building a free and open system that anybody can use as they see fit. Rational economic actors will set the proper balance between block size, on-chain transactions, and off-chain transactions."
Schnorr sigs don’t actually do much to lower fees for existing transactions. They allow new types of transactions that will be cheaper. Direct, on-chain P2P transactions are not coming back to the core chain.

1) Bitcoin has a lowercase ""c"", not a capital ""C"". When you miscapitalize it, it demonstrates just how little attention you pay to the space.

It would arguably be doing a lot *better* in a number of respects, considering that Gavin doesn't even believe in Bitcoin as a store of value (and has been saying since 2011 that he doesn't personally save in BTC or think that we should strive to make it go up in value), and Roger and Jihan are outright attacking Bitcoin these days and trying their best to discredit it and pump certain altcoins in the process.

3) The moderators of this subreddit ban users and remove posts and comments that they don't like (even if those posts or comments don't violate any subreddit rules) on a regular basis.

[Gavin gave his definition of Bitcoin which is objective (chain with most accumulated work).](https://gavinandresen.ninja/a-definition-of-bitcoin) It doesn't put himself or any other developer in the picture. He doesn't say ""the coin I support is Bitcoin.""

"Bitcoin isn't a corporation, nobody owns the ""brand"", and nobody can criminally misuse the ""brand"". 

""The market"" decides what the Bitcoin ""Brand"" corresponds to. But the term ""the market"" really refers to the consensus status in a culmination of ""all markets"", if that makes sense. 

So /r/btc is ""a market"", and in this particular market, it can be said that the term (and ""branding"" of) Bitcoin refers to BCH. 

But across all markets, that is to say, in ""the market"", the term (and ""branding"" of) Bitcoin still refers to what this sub refers to as ""Bitcoin Core"".

And yes, all of this is confusing. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. It is absolutely useless and counterproductive to make any assumption about deliberate deception, because whether there was any, it was in any case not illegal, which means that it had to happen eventually, which ultimately means that it is something we need to figure out how to address through voluntary, market means.

Although I am very much in favour of using hardforks to take power out of the hands of bad dev teams and steer the development of a cryptocurrency, I'm not a BCH supporter - I'm not against it the idea of it either, I just realise I don't have the technical knowledge to know the best answer to the blocksize problem (which I do recognise is a problem), and I think that if BCH's solution is the best one, then BCH's market cap will continue to grow and ultimately increase to such a point where the chain that is currently understood by the average crypto user to ""be Bitcoin"" (the one most of you here refer to as ""Bitcoin core"") will hardfork yet again, following the exact same specifications as Bitcoin Cash, but with the difference that it will have a majority market consensus this time and therefore the increased-blocksize-chain will be the one with the highest market cap and that which ""the market"" considers to ""be Bitcoin"" - The mere forethought (brought about by market trends) of there being a possibility of everyone trying to sell their BTC for BCH would lead virtually the entire bitcoin community to assent to this new hardfork much faster than it would take for everyone to start trying to sell their BTC for BCH, meaning that the market cap of BCH can ultimately never reach BTC's. But that's just my theory - I might be wrong, and would be interested in hearing counterarguments.

In any case, I am glad that the Bitcoin Cash fork happened this early in the development of Bitcoin (yes, it is still early, in my opinion). Despite not owning any Bitcoin Cash myself, I can think of at least a dozen of different ways you guys are helping the future of Bitcoin, but three of them are : 1) Testing the technical implications of increased blocksize in a measurable way. 2) Providing a measure for the overall market preference for a larger blocksize bitcoin (BCH's market cap) which acts as a dynamic pressure/incentive element on Bitcoin. 3) Giving us an early opportunity to understand and address the (again, ultimately inevitable) marketing dilemma aforementioned.

"Wisdom of the crows assumes little friction to be efficient. But a market has a **lot** of inertia. That's why Ethereum, while being better than Bitcoin at practically everything, is not number 1 yet. But it will come, these things just take time.

So, yes, the crowd is mostly with Bitcoin Core now but this will change, slowly but surely."
"Not the same. We are talking about open source software. There is Ubuntu and there is Mint, but both come from the same open source code Linux. 

The fight over the name is mostly driven by greed. None of us had anything to do with the original code and name, unless Satoshi is floating around these boards.

So, there is/will be Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Segwit, Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin...."
Funny,  that nonexistent group set up its own web site.  How odd people can be... 
"Username checks out.

The only reason for you to keep Bitcoin name is because, sadly, bitcoin is not immune to code injection attacks, like segwit, by a group of people monopolizing the development.

Bitcoin core is a very adequate description."
100 bits u/tippr
That's truly fascinating! So when Core softforked it was a way for them to roll out changes ***without having to rely on voting*** - it's completely the other fucking way around of how they put it!
">By that same definition the current Bitcoin Core fork would be an alt-coin since it hard forked in 2013.

You are forgetting about the hard fork satoshi created on July 31, 2010

"What does that have to do with anything? Bitcoin being a currency still can have all of this.

Some people argue like BCH closed doors, when in reality it is reopening all doors that shouldn't have been closed in the first place."
No one controls bitcoin , thus there is no company to hijack a brand from. BCC tends to keep copying much of cores work , and that is ok , because its the nature of open source code. 
"> The crowd is with BTC.

The crowd would not be with BTC if it hadn't been consistently lied to for years."
"Yes, but BTC Core is a *reference* client, which makes it synonymous with BTC, because it uniquely defines ""what is BTC."""
[deleted]
"This is what happened. Bitcoin was hijacked by people it was made to be against and drastically changed into an alt-coin that couldn't get anything out in time. Now your alt-coin is crying that ""it's brand"" was hijacked after pushing the people who were around longer than them out."
You're not using LN for transactions.
Past that, rbtc wouldn't exist except for the [mass censorship campaign on rbitcoin](https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/6rxw7k/z/dl8v4lp)
Let's be far. That's *every* chart right now. BCH has lost more of it's value vs BTC, but it's within pissing distance %-wise.
"Yes, because no other chart looks like that in the market right now.

Also it is clearly about 2 days old as BCH, BTC, and ETH have been recovering.

BCH is doing just fine as several projects come back online that were dead or priced out of BTC, and no amount of your typical trollery will change real, visible progress. "
Stop living in the past. Technology evolves, what it is today is not what it will be tomorrow. 
"You give me and others too much credit ... you know very well that 80% of posts here would be bashing r/bitcoin, theymos, core, greg, and blockstream even without my opinions ... I mean little in the grand scheme of things ... be honest with yourself 

P.s... funny how the new definition of troll is someone you disagree with. "
"No. Simply put, if you want people to listen to your viewpoint it's a poor strategy to use a condescending opening line such as the aforementioned!

"
How is BTC Core not a fork? They soft-forked and completely changed the original model.
"Gavin 90%

Roger 30%

Jihan 0%

BSCore Negative

Although I really appreciate the contribution of Jihan, I have to say that Bitcoin brand would still exist without him translating Bitcoin White Paper into Chinese and manufacturing mining rigs.

As for me, the coin supported by Gavin is Bitcoin.

I don't care about who now controls the Github account or bitcoin.org domain. "
"Because it create FUDs and distract from actual use case. The toxic environments over name already turn a lot of people away from btc/bch.

If you think it is easy to swap btc <> bch by getting all exchanges and vendors around the world to corporates burning their customers and  investors at the same time you are delusional! "
And he gave /u/Papa_Ganda his first bitcoin. 
">You can run old versions of Bitcoin QT...

Nope...QT versions prior to the 2013 HF will not work on the Bitcoin blockchain. Try running v0.3."
"> You can run old versions of Bitcoin QT, even 0.5.4 

[False. Try again.](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7u0n3i/this_is_the_first_client_satoshi_ever_released_if)"
But that's precisely the *trick* Core pulled on everyone by doing a half assed softfork, it's only in theory the same chain, but in practice it's a fork.
">Layer 2 isn't a bad thing, it's showing the demand for bitcoin. 


Layer 2 are not a bad thing, it is forcing the whole network to operate on a second layer by artificially restricting capacity that is the problem."
"Second layer and settlement layer are not synonymous: Settlement layer is really a reference to Bitcoin becoming the ""first layer"" of an enforced multi-layer solution.

Where second layers are options, and exist because they provide something *extra*, they're fine.

The only issue is when second layer becomes mandatory or enforced (either oficially, or through artificial constraints), such that second layer solutions exist out of necessity, not because they're a better solution.

Second layer existing through competition based on the merits of the solution is fine. Second layer existing because fees are too high is not."
Bitcoin Core is also the name of the github it all started on.
"Anything that starts with ""To all the <xxx> shills> deserves a big ol' fashion down vote.

Say NO to partisan crypto politics. "
"Wasn't the original plan to always start to scale up and allow more transactions per second?


This reminds me of the Shia-Sunni divide. Mohammed appoints one man, muslims breaks along who the true successor is. "
If that we’re true you’d be posting on r/BCH. But instead your trying to convince people that you’re actually bitcoin core. Hijacking. 
I know, contributions from blockstream should not have allowed them to hijack the bitcoin brand. Perhaps we should call the cash branch of bitcoin just bitcoin.

"It is not just “name thing”. 

There is real value in branding and BCH community invested heavy both time and money building that brand. Why would we give up on it?

"
Get an argument...
"Neither one adheres to the white paper. Neither are really peer to peer. IP to IP transactions where removed when Satoshi was involved because its a security flaw unto itself. He wasn't even committed to adhering to his own ""vision"". Its like living your life according to the bible instead of within a logical legal framework.

Closest coin to the white paper is probably Bitcoin Gold or another alt coin."
Almost all coins in the top 100 coinmarketcap adhere to the whitepaper and should be called bitcoin.
"I suppose that Satoshi immediately created an altcoin called bitcoin after not following his own whitepaper. Have you even read the whitepaper?
"
"signmessage or gtfo ;-)"
"I was screaming with all my through “Let’s do S2X and preserve community”. 

Core guys was for UASF and NO2X (two movement that was pro split). After that they even ask big blockers to fork off. 

Now as we did they are spamming all communication channels with “BCash = Btrash”, “Roger is bad person”, “Btrash is a scam”, “bCash stole our branding” and similar messages.

And yeah, we are the ones who are dividing community... /s"
Can’t go one day without one camp bashing another 
"I especially like the fact so many of these articles quote a banker

I like Bitcoin precisely because it means I don't have to listen to bankers any more."
I can't think of a more textbook example of a strawman argument than the title of this post... If ya'll have a point to argue, you should try and do it in a way that actually proves your point. :/
Are we still hashing this out?
Point is that we helped build this brand. We can’t “hijack” something we built.
