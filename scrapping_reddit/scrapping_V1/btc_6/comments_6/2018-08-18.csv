Yup it's a crosspost, it says so on the link.
I love it honestly. Its pretty much a bang-on analogy for someone who doesnt want to spend >1minute listening to you rattle off the whitepaper
Because it’s a relatively humorous way to explain it?
Actually would being revved up as fast as you can get it 24/7 be more accurate? Other than that I see no fault.

Is there noway to use that computing power to solve cancer. I use dream lab on phone and laptop when idle and fully charged it is used to run endless simulations. Why can't cryptocurrency be used in a similar fashion.  ? 
The simplest and on point explanation i read about bitcoin haha
This is real haha
You’re confusing bitcoin core with the real bitcoin. Bitcoin core is a revolutionary brand new crypto that is 10x as fast and has twice the capacity of bitcoin cash. Check it out @ https://thebitcoincore.org/ !

"This explanation clearly describes POW: miners waste energy to solve some complex, but unusable math tasks to produce new coins (you can spend on dark markets).

Why this sub is so excited about this dumbass explanation?"
This is so accurate, to the point that it’s uncomfortable but we’re all addicted and want it to continue. We don’t know why. But we love it. Let’s see where it takes us. 
Omg you guys are so lame, get a life

Funny, I hear a lot more of: They stole our logo, they stole our website, they use our ticker on the Reddit subgroup, why do I get downvotes when I say bcash?  LN is a a viable working product for small transactions. Roger is a slimy thief, BTC is the real bitcoin.  And every bit of it is he same old rehashed BS from the echo chamber.
So salty.
"Check it out Market cap of Bitcoin Cash-[https://cryptochartindex.com/currency/bitcoin-cash](https://cryptochartindex.com/currency/bitcoin-cash)

The upgrade will further increase the size of the blocks, from 8MB to 32MB, and will introduce a more sophisticated smart contract capability as well as other features such as the expansion of its time stamping, asset creation and rights management function.

"I suspect some projecting. No. He doesn't comment that much.

There is also the argument against relating to core. How can it not? We also have issue with how much trolls are coming here lately.

Anytime we have adoption or a positive news, the trolls come out in force. So I guess you are right. It's pretty hard to move forward when we are fighting the narrative of lies constantly."

What a coincidence...
"Just checked your post history. Pretty much every comment you make is ""so salty"" on the /r/btc sub reddit.

Glad to see Rogers paid reddit sock puppets aren't slacking off...."
"I *had* to make a couple of BTC transactions in December and it fucking sucked. The amount of money that I wasted was ridiculous. The worst money transfer experience of my life. After that there was no going back for me. BTC was inarguably broken. 


Don't just hand wave that away. That MATTERS. And Greg Maxwell celebrating that?! Pretty dumb for such a smart guy.


You can argue all day about the technical merits of scaling through Lightning, but there's no way people are going to pay such huge fees for the privelege of using it.


And by the way, I know you come here to try to convince people otherwise, but your comments above about DDOSing your lightning node were embarrassing. You're just giving me more reasons to think of lightning as a piece of shit."

Huh?
You are confusing
And now we have Bitcoin core, 1 min interval, 8MB block. It's even faster and with a higher capacity than Bitcoin cash.
So many salty people here :)
Well I didn't see the post, mind if you can give me the link? I can use it to explain bitcoin to my friends. Thanks :)
...?
thanks :)
"Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is a cryptocurrency created via a fork of the Bitcoin network.

On August 1, 2017, Bitcoin split when there was a permanent fork divergence in the blockchain, thereby creating two blockchains: Bitcoin Core (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH). Bitcoin Cash is the upgraded newer version of Bitcoin which preserves the fast, decentralized, inexpensive qualities of Bitcoin network transactions."
