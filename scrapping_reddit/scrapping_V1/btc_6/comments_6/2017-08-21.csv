Where did I assume that? I just said that you don't pay for Blockstream employees.

Please explain, because using Core software is completely voluntary and you don't pay for it in any way."
Yes, thank you for catching that. It's 300% (4x).  
"You are assuming I own bitcoin.

I don't. You are using the same argument that statists use to justify the state.

The enormous Bitcoin Cash volume on competing exchanges is also probably a good motivation for them to add full support for Bitcoin Cash.

yep, I can quess due to their connections to IRS, the delay is probably is to handle tax laws. Obvious due to the fork money has come from thin air.
"Nothing scream legitimacy like no fee trading on Korean exchanges.

People are pissed right now, as they see hundreds of dollars per coin slipping through their fingers... what they don't realize is that by January 2018, those coins that Coinbase is forcing them to hodl will make them a fortune.

Great, maybe it will help all of those in the UK unable to withdraw money. 
I agree with this. Don't just spam, tell them all the good reasons why they should add it. 
yep, same way I got it :P
Losses can make people emotionally invested in a decision. 
This isn't Coinbase as a company, it is one customer support rep giving advice.  The CSR may be doing it in their own self-interest (if they held bitcoins prior to Aug 1st), or to reduce their workload (lots of questions about when it will be available). 
As a developer largely working in IOT lately, I can understand the need to protect against innocuous issues, and I understand that coinbase can't just flip a switch to activate bcc trading, but 5 months is still far more than needed. Many exchanges/services enabled bch trading within a week with no negative reprecussions. So a 2 month timeline would be very realistic for this
you insulted yourself first.
sold what at 20%?  you don't own any, neither btc, nor bcc. it's too obvious.
done.
Cheers for listing the specific path.
Thanks!!
They are but hackers can use the most innocuous issue against you. In tech many things that seem easy at first turn out to be nightmares later.
Ehhh...to be fair, supporting bcc is pretty much the same as supporting btc. Definitely shouldn't take 5 months to support it
"Korean exchanges have fees, and regardless, the price is similar to other exchanges. 

Cool story, tho."
"> You don't want your BCH? I'll give you some of my Cripplecoin BTC for it.

Please, already sold it at ~20%

Thanks for the new car(s), suckeeeers :)"
Yet another reason not to leave your coins on an exchange.
"Tax law is very well developed.  Likely they would treat this as a tax-free spin-off, like when Time Warner Cable separated from the rest of Time Warner.  Where there was one asset, now there are two.  The only question is how to assign ""basis"", your cost for calculating capital gains or losses to the new coins.  But that has nothing to do with Coinbase, that's on individual taxpayers.  All Coinbase has to do is report purchases and sales."

"if they are all appropriately categorized as "" request for support of new currency"" then it won't really bother them since it's easy to filter and use that data only when they want to."
No. Do you have a coherent response to add to the discussion, or just quasi-insulting questions?
"Every cause has 5 nuts squawking loudly about it. 

They want to hear from the quiet majority before they'll believe it's a good decision. It's just good business. "
I'm assuming OP is being a dick. It seems highly unlikely that Coinbase - having already publicly stated their plans on multiple occasions - would encourage users to flood their support with requests.
Probably a lower level support guy who can't make any decisions but knows that more requests for it will pressure management to do something. 
There are so many other options that Coinbase, just don't use them until they do add support. Nothing is better than a good loss of profit to make people/company change their position.
As a newb i have a difficult Time to buy bcc. I still wait for a good oportunity to buy cheap. It looks like i Need to get a credit card..

"""Over the last several days, we’ve examined all of the relevant issues and have decided to work on adding support for bitcoin cash for Coinbase customers.""

""We are planning to have support for bitcoin cash by January 1, 2018""

 https://blog.coinbase.com/update-on-bitcoin-cash-8a67a7e8dbdf"
Surprised you guys didn't ask for this sooner. Waiting until January of next year is fucking ridiculous. I'm guessing the price surge is the reason. Get your money people.
"I have a sneaky suspicion they will do it sooner rather than later.

But yes, write to them, bug them -- it does help!"
Yarrr, have done.  Good idea
Too bad regulations are severely holding back market efficiency or we would already see competition rising up to compete against coinbase in order to satisfy demand for Bitcoin Cash.  /u/CashTipper tip 0.002 BCC
Hit them up on Twitter.. I went for a month trying to get support.. and then when I bugged them on Twitter, I got support the next day.
"I guess one should use ""Contact Our Team"" ?"
what is the best exchange right now for BCH?
"I just sent an email to ""support"" at least:

""Coinbase, as you can see I've been a customer of yours for several years, since 2013 I think, but I fully support the new Bitcoin Cash and you should too. Since you don't (yet) I've been forced to move all my trading (and fees) to Kraken. Bummer for you..."
"Coinbase doesn't publicly list a support phone number on their site but one does indeed exist: +1-800-343-5845

Nice that ICANN requires contact information for domains. :D

I understand that Coinbase wants to funnel support requests down one path to better focus on, but nothing says you are human better than ""Yea I am calling you now."""
So...wtf? They recognize the demand enough to say please reach out to us and tell us about your demand we already know about? Sounds like nonsensical BS
"I wrote them a message about how I like the services they provide and how I have found it difficult to participate in the growing Bitcoin Cash market and how I wished they offered their services for Bitcoin Cash sooner than the beginning of next year. I encourage everyone to also write thoughtful and clear messages to them and not just spam Coinbase with ""Please support Bitcoin Cash"" or ""Why dont you support BCH yet?"". Show them that we are intelligent people that wish to have a better experience provided for handling, transacting and acquiring Bitcoin Cash and that we wish to bring our business to them. This will have greater impact when they see a multitude of requests each unique and see that their users spent time to make this request and that they should listen.



Side note: As a software developer, it takes time to make changes, especially since they would want to add support to the mobile apps. They do need time to put together additional infrastructure and test the new code and load on the network they would introduce by adding this functionality. No one wants a service to add support for a new Cryptocurrency and then the servers they are using cannot keep up with demand and we have a scenario where they become a joke in the community. They need to make sure they do things right and that takes time. And iOS apps take a little longer due to the approval process so they would likely try and get that done first after adding backend support or have to wait on approval to occur to launch the services on all platforms they support at the same time. This may not add a lot of time but it still does add time. I think the roadmap of support at the beginning of next year though is a bit more time than is really needed. They have standards in place (or should) for how to add new cryptocurrencies to their services. They should be able to accelerate them if the money is there and they see the value in making things happen a little quicker."
"You can add Bitstamp to this too
"
It's better if supply is restricted for a while, so the value can be sustained as bch gains traction. A big dumpening could be very damaging now. Bitstamp also haven't freed their users' bch yet. 
"/u/cashtipper tip .25 USD

Doing the community a service here."
True but you shouldn't pressure an exchange to add a coin under tight deadlines. They need to write and test their code and that takes time. Exchanges have been hacked many times, they have a duty to be as careful as possible.
Their stockholm syndrome is too strong. I think millions of dollars of lost income might change that. 
Yes, they should be more inclined to listen to the users because of that.
Hi coinbase can we just add bcash? Also bcrap another new fork I just launched yesterday as well. Make it one time effort 
if coinbase does btc will die!
Yeah,  gotta dump that BitCH while it's pumped to over 6% again :D
"Fuck coinbase. They are anti free speech and closed accounts because of #fakenews calling any white protestor a ""white supremist.""  

So if you want to keep your euro & american culture and protest - then the news will call you racist. 
Then coinbase and google will deny you service. 

Yet antifa starts riots and attacks with bike locks. But msm and coinbase dont care. "
Please don't pressure them they might need time to buy back missing ~~Ethereum Classic~~ Bitcoin Cash
"Well, Kraken won't even let me enter a bank account right now even after Tier 3 verification, so I can't even get any money out.

Just FYI."
They already announced they'd be supporting it.  Rushing them to do so before they feel can roll out support securely is not a good idea.
I for one am thankful for their BCH policy.  It finally helped motivate me to get off my ass and learn how to use software wallets, nodes and other exchanges.  I've learned a lot and am much better off for it.  Thanks O'coinbase!
And Gemini.

"... although I do see potential for generating a lot of new ""words"" using this rough framework. Take and single-syllable word and combine it with another one and remove the space between them.

"I never heard ""slanted"", nor ""tilted"", in this context; the other ""upset"" ones you got right though.

A ""fanboy"" (or ""fangirl""), is someone that is an unconditional fan, that ignores the flaws of what they're fan of and defend it no matter what; in situations where there are competition (like with gaming consoles, or cryptocoins), they also tend to criticize the competition unconditionally.

I think ""Shitcoin"" you also got right.


""Shitposts"" are usually intentionally crappy posts, often done for humorous purposes.

Hi /u/spez, the censorship at /r/bitcoin has really gotten out of hand. They're hijacking a community for one of the most important inventions of mankind. It really reflects badly on Reddit that they allow this censorship to continue. Just like what happened with /r/technology, please revoke the moderators' access and hold an election for new moderators.
It basically works. If you only allow in the news and discussion that's flattering to your side, the people that only get the news and discussion from you will think your side is great. (See also Fox News and the U.S. president.)
