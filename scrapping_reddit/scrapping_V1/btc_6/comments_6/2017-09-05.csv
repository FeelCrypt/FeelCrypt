And how is it reserve for 100 Billion ? You saying at anytime there is only 340 Mil  crypto saved to USDT ? 
Market cap is not a good representation of value. Do you think you can sell every single bitcoin in circulation at its present sticker price? The market value is heavily inflated by speculation, and that's a tenuous platform to stand on.

"Thanks for the explanation.

I suppose you could also assume that there are far less people that are also trying to sell into tether? Given the situation in the market I would assume this could go either way (as to what the effect would be). On one hand, not having a safe-haven (USDT) could be more beneficial for BTC in the longer term."
They say they only have 340 million in reserves, and according to them they only issue at 1:1. And every tether issued is visible on their blockchain.. So couldn't someone verify that? What do you mean reserve for 100 billion?
So I'm pretty new to crypto altogether, but I wanted to ask from those more familiar with this space: if Tether implodes, this would cause a big decrease in prices across crypto, correct? But, generally speaking, this would be more of a cause for concern for traders than holders right? As in, its effects should (hopefully) come to pass, and crypto would continue to grow? (Like 5+ years for example). Thanks for any insight!

True, but if I'm able to create tether without paying USD and then immediately trade that tether for BTC then I just got BTC without paying anything. Thanks for the clarification though, I should have worded that differently.
"> To whom is tether issued

Richard Simmons.

> and what do they do with it?

He rubs it all over his body while singing ""glory, glory hallelujah"" .
"
"> It's equivalent to the ability to create BTC out of thin air

No.  The total number of BTC in existence is unaffected."
"> the Tether backed bank

Exactly which bank is this?"
"Last year I did some numbers because I came across a statistic that the average time a share of stock is held is like 20 or 11 seconds. What it looks like, at least with stocks in the stock market, is that literally 99.5% of stocks are sitting in people's portfolios for years at a time while only 0.5% of shares are actively traded on a daily basis. That means the trades of those 0.5% of shares going back and forth every few seconds for 7 hours a day between stock traders' computers determines the values of the other 99.5% of the shares of the stock. 99.5% of the shares of whatever being at like $1000 each doesn't matter if the most recent transaction a second ago was for $10. The $10 becomes the price of all the rest of the 99.5% of not active shares. (Everyone who isn't an active investor benefits from active traders who spend their time determining the live price of their shares via the ""market"", the exchange itself.)

If you buy or sell hundreds of millions of $ of stock at at time like Warren Buffet, you can't show up to the stock market and buy or sell $1 billion worth of stock at once, the price would go crazy, which is what you don't want. You have to space your transaction out over time to not overwhelm the normal volume of trading.

Another example of this is like in 2008. Say 1% of people who hold shares for years at a time on the sideline saw the horrible news about a bank collapsing so they decided they wanted to sell now. Suddenly you have the normal 0.5% of shares looking to buy and like 1.5% of shares wanting to sell. The price of the stock falls like a rock to reach the point where the price induces another 1% of new buyers to come off the sidelines to buy to balance the amount shares sellers want to sell. Every transaction has a willing buyer and seller at that price--someone thinks it's a good idea to sell at that price and someone else thinks it's a good idea to buy at that price. If the price of something falls by 10% in the course of a trading day, someone thought it was a good buy at -1%, -2%, etc all the way down.

The original top post is saying that tethers that are made of air are massively puffing up the price of bitcoin. As soon as the tethers disappear, it could be half or more of the active demand to buy bitcoins at the current price is instantly gone. You're back to the situation where suddenly there is the normal volume to sell at $5k but now all the buyers with tether-money are gone leaving regular folks who'd were there all along at like $1k. It doesn't matter what all the rest of value of all the other bitcoins is. The price is going to plummet to the price where the amount of formerly not-active buyers becomes interested in buying bitcoins to meet the demand of sellers who came out to sell at what had been $5k per bitcoin."
How could it be more? isnt the tether blockchain public?
I completely agree that this is extremely concerning.  However, can someone here play devil's advocate and try to provide a reasonable explanation for how Tether in circulation has been legitimately increasing?
