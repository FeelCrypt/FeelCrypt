I misread and thought you were a bitcoin core guy. I get it now. 
So we forked and did it ourselves

Yes
... isnt the entire reason for the split is core wont increase block size?
So you are not making sense. Fees are huge and btc cash people wanted to increase the blocksize, and core people said no way never... 
"I'm all in bitcoin cash.   I even wanted to help (why not?) so I went to:

https://www.bitcoincash.org/

I found  the dev link:

https://www.bitcoincash.org/developers

On the dev page 2 of the javascript repos use the name bcash...

Javascript: https://github.com/BitGo/bcashjs-lib
Javascript https://github.com/satoshilabs/bitcore/tree/bcash

I don't care if they call it bcash.   This is a legit site, right?  Actual bitcoin cash people...  so, the fact they named the repo bcash.... I don't care.  Bitcoin Cash wins.   Bitcoin Segwit is on the ropes and Satoshi Bitcoin Cash won't be stopped.   POWER MOVES are being made by POWER PLAYERS and the real chain is making itself known.   Awareness is increasing.   BITCOIN CASH IS WINNING."
