"https://ibb.co/kGtyfd  <- This is the mail they sent.

I just (stupidly) put in 3k hoping to get TRX last week with these guys. Now I have a sinking feeling, especially having just checked my email. They sent me a mail saying that they've ""closed [my] account due to inactivity"". I can't see any currency when logging in. The rep said on the email that I provided the wrong type of ticket number. I just provided the one they gave me. But I think I send them the wrong number and now I found it. They said that ""Jose"" is not one of their staff. That is who I talked to on the phone. Now that number is no longer connecting. If I got a fake number from them, they are on the hook for that I believe.

My actual (but closed) ticket number is 741464

I'm sending a PM to the OP and will attempt to get my money. If I had a crystal ball I would not use these guys.

People who have more complicated banking needs. I mentioned that they exist but often have no physical locations in my original comment. 
Of course, but fractional reserves aren’t inherently bad. There is a federally mandated limit to fractional reserving that actually shouldn’t exist in a free market. That ratio is based on risk and people are free to deposit at bank that fractionally reserve 10:1 or even 100:1, and the higher that reserve ratio the greater return you get for keeping your savings there, but the more risk you carry as well.

They can create IOU's of Bitcoin, as they do it with dollars, even with the Gold standard. Debt is money, since 5'000 years or more. "
"Didn't say the bank charges it, but no they don't you're correct. But it's still a fee, apples to apples. 

I fully disagree with the ""being too lazy to lend it out yourself."" Lending it out and saving it are mutually exclusive with regards to access to funds, you can't possibly lend it out and still have the access to easy savings like you do with a savings account. On top of that, the bank has a network to lend to, regardless of laziness\-level,  I will never have a comparable one without becoming....a bank "
"Fractional reserve banking is the reason why some banks allow a ""no fee"" policy. By mandate of law when you deposit your money into the bank the bank is allowed to create 10x or whatever the exact amount is of your money out of thin air and lend it out to other customers & businesses. This of course inflates the money supply, again rendering your money less worth."

"“Agreed to” can be argued. I remember when my bank called me and told me about opting out of overdraft. I made it very clear I wanted things declined, not to overdraft. I distinctly remembered it because it’s not very often that I get aggravated on the phone (everyone is just doing their job). This kid just would not take no for an answer so I ripped into him a little. Fast forward to almost a year later. I get hit with tons of overdrafts, as I expected things to be declined, so I called the bank. Ended up moving up the food chain to some sort of management which tells me that the calls were recorded. I laughed because I remember the call. He called back awhile later and was like “oh yeah, you definitely declined”. All fees dropped. 

I always say you need to be nice to people that handle your money, or handle your food. This was an example as to why. "
I don’t get charged for transactions, or to withdraw money, or get charged a monthly fee with my banks

"Lots of people complaining about bank practices on here, which is fine but most of those arguments don’t serve to support using crypto as an alternative. Can’t keep a balance?   You can’t have enough to be in crypto.  Tired of ATM fees? You can’t use bit coin at a cash only bar.  Need 10k next Tuesday? Hope you BTC appreciates in a week.  

I get the idea but it’s impractical as anything other than a speculative investment in a novelty item right now. Communism works on paper too.  Crypto proponents want to lead a revolution. So far they made a bunch of dark web drug dealers and pedophiles rich. "
You agreed to that.
I'm not seeing the problem still. The bank isn't charging you anything because they use your money to make money instead of you using it to make money. And you don't need a network like a bank to make money by lending, that's what bonds are. I'm not trying to absolve banks of the shady things that they do but to say they are taking your money for nothing is somewhat dishonest. What would you expect a bank to do, pay you for the privilege of keeping your money secure?
[deleted]
So what does forbid banks to take less risks? Reserve is very small nowadays, something around 14% if i'm not mistaken. Keep what is required in reserve and something on top to make risks even less. Who does that? Any banks there? How is that connected to the evilness of Central Banking you mentioned in your initial comment? Why ability to mint does not make banks evil? In your initial comment you've stated that for Central Bank it makes.
That's the lightning network. Trading the underlying asset is sooo important to prevent the creation of Fiat. Which is why I'm against it.
[deleted]
Not sure I completely follow what you just said,  but in a free market the consumers risk preferences is what limits the reserve ratio. Note: the US is not a free market 
What?
I'm asking why you're blaming Central Bank if commercial banks can hold as much in reserves as they want and restrict their ability to mint. Your initial statement was that Central Bank is bad because it is minting and commercial banks are not bad. But in fact commercial banks are minting much more.

You don’t understand the fundamental time value of money. That is the premise of banking. You should go read about it before you comment further.
Can you point out a specific issue with something I said. I understand that principle 
So I guess not and you’re just trying to sound smart
"I m surprised I did write a reply but does not appear to have been posted.

In essence your money can be put to work by lending it to others or acquiring stakes in productive ventures.

If you give it to the bank they get to exercise that option and generally do pay you little or interest.

Locking your money in to get zero fees is traded for the value of committing that money to a venture which has a real monetary value.

Further inflation is a very real aspect of the wider global economy; the spending power of your idle money decreases everyday and noticeably every year. Your money is actually shrinking in the bank while you marvel at your zero fees.

Bitcoin via cash fork  or lightening network offers near zero fees for transactions and a store of value that is far milder in inflation and in fact presently hyper deflationary year on year.

Good enough answer?"
How could playing with the ball costs so much?
"Your missing the bigger picture.

I can’t nurse you over reddit. The internet of money by Andreas antanopolous is a starting point. You get it as an audio book through amazon audible as a free trial. Not a bad use of 5 hours, but it’s only a starting point."
"See I know that. BCH is also extremely volatile, so it’s not really a great store of value if it can go from $2600 to $600 in a month or so. That is not a great store of value by any measure...

Let’s say I had $100k total. I would invest 90k into properties and stocks, put 5k into crypto, and I would put 5k into savings for an emergency fund (car breaks down or something). 

I would much rather be guaranteed 2-5% inflation and devaluation of my savings, than need the money and have it down 60% because crypto markets crashed. 

I think you may have misunderstood and thought I meant put all my money into savings and not invest it? Obviously that would be very stupid. But there is definitely an important use for using a bank."
You got the free savings and checking account because you have a credit card. Banks earn lot of money from people using credit and not paying it all on time, which might not be you, but are hundreds of millions other people. You are one of the lucky ones that has enough money and can afford to pay all bills on time, but reality is most people do not. Nothing is for free in Capitalism, especially not in banking system that is setup to systematically steal funds from the population.
"Yeah, same here. If you are switch banks. Your bank is shit. Credit Unions are where its at...

My credit union pays me a percent of earnings..."
Someone understands 
True. But the system is designed to take advantage of people who can’t maintain minimum account balances or pay off a credit card in full. Plus you earn a small fraction of what the bank earns with your money, so it also contributes to an increasing wealth imbalance.
Posts like this REALLY make me question the utility of bitcoin and the sanity of its supporters if their main arguments don’t even hold water... which banks follow the principles of this meme for the AVERAGE consumer? 
Only for the ones with good credit. How about the majority of people that don’t qualify for such programs. 15billion in overdraft fees that means the bank made money off people who didn’t have it in the first place . :/ forcing them to decide pay my bank or feed my kids. 
You're describing savings account, while OP is describing checking account and checking account fees.
Where is point number 2? Thanks for leaving me hanging you insensitive clod.
Inflation is the fee, currently about 10%/year in large American cities.

Then, the US Governemnt through FDIC will provide up to 250,000 balls to everyone. You see, a long time ago everyone came to us for their balls at once and it was chaos. We decided that this was a terrible risk, so we addressed it
Wouldn't a bank that holds crypto not be able to do that tho?

Lol written like a true five year old.  Banking and credit systems brought about the fucking Renaissance.  Cryptocurrencies want to bring us back to the dark ages.  Embarrassing.
"> Cryptocurrencies want to bring us back to the dark ages.

Really?

Why are you stuck in the past?

"
You’re saying that when OP is trying to advocate crypto by saying that the whole system of banking and credit is bunk?  Do you realize how absurdly childish that is?  
"That is not banking at all.

Stupid meme"
Having a central bank that can print money is not inherently bad. Having Bitcoiners who don't understand ecomics is bad.
"the boy on the left is ""private cartel"".  The boy on the right is ""the nation"".  The red ball is both the money itself and the authority to create new money and regulate who gets to play with it.  

I think the cartoon simplifies, as all such cartoons do.   But it is basically accurate and is very telling."
Can you really call inflation a fee that the bank charges though? It would occur whether you put your money in the bank or under a mattress. Sure there's the opportunity cost of them lending your money out but that's a price paid for being too lazy to do it yourself.
Credit unions participate in the shared branching network. There are something around 10,000 shared branches in the US. Online banks also exist (free accounts btw). Who needs a physical branch anymore with free mobile deposit, direct deposit, debit cards, etc?
Fractional reserve banking is bad 
So judging from your upvotes there are at least 157 bankers who are reading this subreddit with the purpose of totally improving Bitcoin Cash. Yay!
Summarizes most of BTC as well. 
Better to generate tehter amiright? Totally different.
But you're paying a fee for someone else to hold the ball securely so that you don't get beat up and someone steals your ball.
They are trying to be Bitcoin. BTC seems to have given up that goal.
"What goal?

I know BCH is trying to take the place of BCH. I also hate the way they’re doing it. "
Core changed key factors, and for a while there was nothing still following the origin Bitcoin plan, there was nothing fitting the definition of Bitcoin left.
I call Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Scam. Cause thats what it is.
"I believe, according to the code, any coin with the most accumulated proof of work is known as Bitcoin. That's why BTC currently has the name. Yes, I believe that will change if the better coin is adopted by the world and is worth more in the future. Unless BTC fixes it's major problems, BCH should be worth more than BTC. The social engineering attacks used against BCH should not keep fooling the public too much longer. If BCH ""is the better Bitcoin"" it will grow in value and miners will mine it more and the name will flip.

Oh, and BCH is working on Project (goals) A still. BTC decided to go with working on Project (new goals) B."
>  Miners who receive block rewards will not be taxed, as their services are considered to be voluntary, according to the document.  
Thanks for the quick response. It's probably uncertain what would happen if a miner sells those rewards on an exchange. I understand that they don't pay taxes for those rewards received, but selling them during the first year would probably imply taxes.
">What's new is that Germany doesn't tax mining or staking either.

Hi, regarding the mining and staking announcement, does that mean that I can mine or stake a coin today and sell it tomorrow without having to pay any taxes in that transaction? Thanks"
">I can PM you the email of a tax specialist I consulted.

Hi Ant\-n, if you don't mind, could you PM me the email of the tax specialist you consulted? Thanks"
