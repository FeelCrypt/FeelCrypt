The real discussion is - WHAT second referendum? What is the meaning of having a 2nd referendum? Are referendums to be repeated until people vote in a way that the media defines as ""correct""? A case can be made to repeat a referendum after, say, 10-20 years, but it directly defeats the purpose of a yes/no vote, if you keep on running referendums until you get a ""no"".

Of course we [measured and published the results](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2016-May/012625.html) and did others.  We also didn't deploy it without formally specifying (as BU did with Xthin), nor did we deploy it without peer review (as did BU), and we didn't deploy it without making sure the implementation didn't contain vulnerabilities (such as those BU and Classic had due to Xthin), nor did we deploy it with substantial protocol design flaws (the collision vulnerability in Xthin; which also later turned into an exploitable DOS attack on BU nodes).

> Who knows if compact blocks can even scale above 1MB. 

Ironically, compact blocks scalablity is fairly straight forward-- it's inherently linear in bandwidth until the chance probability of collision of six byte IDs becomes non-negligible (calculations for this are given in the BIP) then it degrades fairly gracefully (which was experimentally verified by artificially reducing it to two and three byte IDs in testing).  Because of the bloom filter, xthin has inherently worse than-linear bandwidth usage (bloom filter size is n log n; but with constant factors that make the disadvantage small until relatively large sizes).
"
Did they fix the xthin vulnerability that was attacked earlier this year? 
"From the whitepaper:

>The incentive may help encourage nodes to stay honest. If a greedy attacker is able to
assemble more CPU power than all the honest nodes, he would have to choose between using it
to defraud people by stealing back his payments, or using it to generate new coins. He ought to
find it more profitable to play by the rules, such rules that favour him with more new coins than
everyone else combined, than to undermine the system and the validity of his own wealth."
"Yes,  and the less transactions that propagate as a result of an overloaded network results in longer validation times as as  block needs to be fully validated before it is relayed to the network. 

The net byproduct of longer validation times is orphaned blocks and lost revenue. So miners have an economic incentive to avoid orphaned blocks by ensuring they are not including transactions that have not fully propagated the network. IE they have an incentive to run block size within the capacity of the network. 

Xthin just allows the network to use less bandwidth and make effective use of the bandwidth that is available. 
"
"Ok, thanks! Then the originally mentioned ""20..50 MB"" for 1 GB blocks is misleading. Correct would be:

* If in a far future when we have 1 GB blocks, then the amount of data that needs to be stored is 1 GB per block irrespective of Xthin (and not ""20..50 MB instead of 1 GB thanks to Xthin"" as stated earlier somewhere).

* If in a far future when we have 1 GB blocks, then the amount of data that needs to transferred per block is 1 GB instead of many GBs thanks to Xthin (and not ""20..50 MB instead of 1 GB thanks to Xthin"", as stated earlier somewhere)."
"> LOL, I just checked the link, its just some kid with blue hair on a computer saying words.

Nevermind the fact that I'm not even linking to a post of Matt's--

Matt is one of the longest standing and most experienced Bitcoin developers-- by active months count he is third behind Pieter and Wladimir.

The original design of xthin itself was [copied from his earlier proposal](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4ib8sm/we_need_a_new_place_to_review_bips/d2wwbm0/), the bloom filter code and serialization design that xthin uses was [created by him](https://github.com/Bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/bd21612c37cf4f2df3a6926beff8a7f89714235e)... In total I believe that he wrote more of BU than all ""BU developers"" combined. 

Matt is not a kid, but if he were one wouldn't it just be extra sad that all of BU combined looks more or less useless in comparison to his work? But is an ageist ad hominem the only counter you have?   

> get a life and publish a peer reviewed data in a peer reviewed document stop with your crap. 

The work on compact blocks was done in a peer reviewed venue-- the Bitcoin development list.  In fact, among many others Peter R reviewed it (and revealed that he didn't understand [the mathematics of collisions](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2016-May/012648.html) in the process)-- the specification also changed in response to review e.g. Tom Zander complained about the new normative variable length integer used in the getblocktxn, and while we didn't take his suggestion of bastardizing UTF8 text encoding to do it, we did change the getblocktxn to just use the varint that was preexisting in the Bitcoin P2P protocol since doing so simplified the proposal.  By contrast, Xthin's work was published in mass media venues which were not subject to external review, and the work was done without a the specification needed to even make review possible."
Except if the miners are the only nodes that are validating blocks, then literally nobody would even know a 51% attack occurred, or that extra coins were minted. This is why we need non mining full nodes.
Yes they did.
"There would be no point in having 1 GB blocks if they were always full.  A better way of estimating the required storage for blocks is to consider the total size of all transactions.  This must be stored for a suitable period of time, perhaps several months.  It is necessary to keep the unspent transaction data, which is much smaller, and is more related to the number of bitcoin users than to their transaction volume.  (This assumes no ridiculous fee market that creates many dust transactions that clutter up the UTXO database.)
"
And you think your residential internet connection is safe from the government? LOL! What ISP do you have that’s going to protect you over listening to some hypothetical government order to block nodes in their network.
"SPV entails no additional trust. Bitcoin is premised on miners being intelligently profit-seeking. SPV wallets and ""full-node"" wallets are equally secure under those conditions. And if miners wanted to shaft Bitcoin there is a far more damaging attack than the invalid block attack you are implicitly concerned about. This far worse attack is known as doublespending. ""Full nodes"" are useless against this attack, since it uses perfectly valid blocks. 

Miners are like guys with guns who have no incentive to shoot you, and ""full nodes"" are like gas masks. They guard against a much weaker attack that if a miner were to go crazy he wouldn't even use because he has a powerful gun and you have no bulletproof vest (despite apparently convincing yourself your gas mask is a bulletproof vest)."
Yawn. And somehow none of you have a single clue how to increase capacity on your pathetic weak chain. Outstanding!
You're not trusting any specific party. You're at most trusting the network isn't under a >50% attack. Other than that the SPV node can verify everything is correct by checking the cryptographic proofs it needs. But it only checks the block headers and the transactions it's interested on. 
Correct, It doesn't ask for verification (as you stated before), it asks for PROOF and then validates the given proof.

"**Email authentication**

Email authentication, or validation, is a collection of techniques aimed at equipping messages of the email transport system with verifiable information about their origin. It is a coarse-grained authentication, usually at Administrative Management Domain (ADMD)  level or message transfer agent level, and implies no sort of authorization. That is, the purpose of email authentication is to validate the identities of the ADMDs or MTAs who participated in transferring and possibly modifying a message. The results of such validation can then be used in email filtering, and can assist recipients when selecting an appropriate action or reply to an incoming message.

"SPV can prove that a transaction is in the most-work chain. It is vulnerable to momentary anomalies where a minority miner (who for some reason is mining invalid blocks) temporarily gets a few lucky blocks out ahead of the majority, but is secure if a few extra confirmations are waited for, since the math rapidly diminishes the possibility of a minority miner staying in the lead toward zero. Statistical certainty for any practical application comes on average just a few minutes after the same for ""full nodes.""  

However, while a ""full node"" requires no confirmations to guard against this oddball attack, it is equally vulnerable to the much more viable and damaging attack: the doublespend in a 51% attack. 

People spread FUD about SPV wallets by essentially saying SPV is like having no locks on your doors or windows. What they aren't telling you is that so-called ""full nodes"" merely lock the windows while leaving the doors wide open. A miner who went rogue would do a doublespend (walk through the front door) rather than an invalid block attack (try to struggle through a window), as the former is far more damaging.

Good question but no. Xthin works by using already propogated data about mempool transactions to describe how a block was put together so it can be recreated and verified on the other side. Traditional block propogation sends the entire block even the transactions that a node may have already downloaded. Xthin (and similar technologies) remove that duplication of effort.

Yes 1gb blocks aren't for children.
"One processor core can verify the signatures in a 1 GB block in about 10 minutes, as each signature verification takes about 100 microseconds.  A 1 GB block contains about 3 million transactions, with about 12 million inputs and outputs.  Therefore about 20,000 UTXO operations have to be performed per second.  This can be done using a few SSDs to handle this database traffic.   Less database bandwidth will be required in practice if you assume RAM caching, but taking this properly into account would require detailed user workload modeling.

"Understand I am tired and I don't think I fully grok.

OK... 

I understand the validation part, but MY node does not need to do that, it can simply request from another fully sync'd node (or multiple nodes) whether my transaction is valid and then that transaction can be populated to the remainder of the network (Right?)

Maybe that wouldn't be considered ""fully validating"" in a very exacting definition, but if I poll enough nodes that are fully sync'd, then whether I am fully sync'd shouldn't matter to anyone but me. And once I am fully sync'd...

Every transaction that is sent when it is sent is propagated. Xthin just includes the bits of the block you are missing so no need to resend the transactions you have.

"If a single transaction has to be sent twice then incompetent Core people have created an unnecessary load on the network.  This has nothing whatsoever to the details of RBF.  It is all about running the network close to capacity due to an arbitrarily small block size limit.  Any form of RBF is only needed when the network is fundamentally broken and operating inefficiently and incorrectly.
"
Ignorant about what?   If someone really wants to run their own node on a rented VM they can, then just use a lightweight client back to that.  
"Full nodes already request missing transactions from other nodes. And it already does not matter if other nodes are fully validating. So, from the miner's perspective, what matters is if a produced block is valid to others or not. That's why validating transactions that are included is important.

So you are right. You inclusively can produce valid blocks without validating a single thing (empty blocks, for which you only need the header of the previous, or any block if you assume any transaction you receive is valid).

It's a matter of risk. I don't have enough knowledge to tell all the implications but being a fully validating is the accepted way of reducing risks to the minimum. Using UTXO commitments is the next bet for helping nodes achieve the lowest risk as quickly as possible. That's why it's a good thing: less cost, same risk."
It's a rewrite of several subsystems but not prohibitive...
"They can validate payments.

"X thin sends the transaction id's so as to not send the whole block. I have to have already seen the transaction so I can match the transaction id's with the transaction. If you only have the id's, you also don't have the chain of signatures used to validate them.

It's like if a hospital sends you a list of names, do you have their full medical history? No, you then look up each name to get the data. Same idea."

"All - probably not, but most users don't care.

Light wallets don't partake in rebroadcasting information much. They're exist for another purpose
"Read Section 8 of the whitepaper. There is zero additional trust involved in SPV compared with running a ""full node."""
Pruning is already a fact. What I'm questioning is the need for nodes to validate the entire blockchain before they start pruning. That is just a waste of time and resources, the security advantage is minimal at best and since it makes running a node unfeasible if you can not run it 24/7 it can fairly be classified as a severe security limitation forcing users to rely on other third-party nodes when they should be perfectly able to run a pruned node themselves.

">X thin is the transfer of what's in a block, not storage. You would still have to store 1GB for a 1GB block. 

if I transfer certain content with 50 MB, I can store this same 50 MB. Saying I need 1 GB for this is a contradiction. Then apparently I also transferred 1 GB."
The big bandwidth eater today is the INV messages announcing transactions when used with nodes connected to many peers.  The data in each transaction is received by each peer only once, but each of its many peers send a 40 byte INV message for each transaction to each of its neighbors.  So if a node had 100 neighbors, the INV for a 300 byte message would end up costing 4000 bytes.  This is an obscene amount of overhead and which can easily be fixed once people set their minds to it.
"> compact blocks have no real world test data 

You realize that the entire Bitcoin network uses compact blocks almost exclusively and that it's xthin which has only seen small scale usage and synthetic tests, right?"
Indeed, though on that basis the compact block protocol already used by the Bitcoin network is much more efficient...

the video is a little to dumbing down but the summary is good. 

I've been refining my understanding since December 2012 - the Quantity of money theory needs an update.

BTC isn't the money for a new economy yet, it's a speculative asset in an emerging economy. Most of the money supply is being withheld from circulation reducing the available quantity (M) 

in effect investors in BTC are like the decentralized [FOMC](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fomc.asp) at the FED  we're working collectively to grow a monetary system and kick-start an economy adding too and withdrawing from the total money supply. in an erratic and decentralized way. 

it's fascinating to watch "
"Sigh...

You need a path between sender and receiver, right?  
That obviously creates a strong incentive for well connected hubs. Garage hubs would be useless.

These well connected hubs wouldn't be able to run anonymously, again obviously. That would make them target to regulations.  
Plus, these hubs are, by definition, *money transmiters*. No serious company would be legally allowed to connect itself to one that's not regulated. It would be like Walmart having an account at an illegal bank.

Just read about FATCA and how the US government controls banks worldwide due to the simple fact that the US is an unavoidable financial hub.

Contrast that with on chain transactions, where any single miner anywhere may include your transactions, no relationship between sender, receiver or miner needed."
"RBF is specifically constructed to avoid bandwidth inflation.  For a given amount of spam-spend it it always equal or cheaper to use up bandwidth using new individual transactions rather than replacements.  That is the ""by fee"" component of RBF.  As a result RBF cannot expand an attacker's ability to waste bandwidth.  Satoshi's original replacement lacked this defense which is why we had to disable it, once Peter Todd came up with this defense it became reasonable to re-enable the ability to make a replaceable non-final transaction.
