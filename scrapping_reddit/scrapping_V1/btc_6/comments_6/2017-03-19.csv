Bitfinex is an investor in Blockstream. There is a relationship there.
"Does this mean I LOSE ALL MY MONEY tho, I have $5k of BTC at $1220 and dropped down to $958 now. 

DOES IT NEED TO DROP TO ZERO AND THEN WE ST ART USING THE BTC UNLIMITED ALT COIN or something? How does this work??"
Simple moves in price of BTC itself don't tell us anything unambiguously. Is it falling because a fork is nearing, or because Core is being recalcitrant, or because of the UASF talk, or for some other completely unrelated reason? We cannot know, because BTC currently represents *both* sides of any fork that could be coming. The only way to know what the market wants is to allow trading one side of the potential fork against the other. Only then can the market say anything clearly.
Lol, such statement would banned there at once :))
Only after the fork is *planned,* not inevitable. The idea is if the fork is planned and futures trading shows it to be a value-decreasing change, the miners cancel their plans (and those who bet on the change still lose money to those who bet against it). 
You attended the presentation and Charlie was not there?
"On that topic, SRD, a subreddit that exists entirely to link at other subreddits for the sole purpose of mocking them mercilessly, [has gotten rid of their ""np"" rule](/r/SubredditDrama/comments/5rlmza/attention_users_new_and_old_were_paring_down_our/ ""look ma, no NP!""), under the well documented notion that it's confusing and useless.

But it's still probably a really good reason somehow."
I tought people not using np may get baned by the subreddit he linked to(/r/btc), not got removed from the subreddit he posts on (/r/bitcoin). 
">But my concern was that it was actually a thinly veiled attempt to keep the BTC moniker pegged to core software.

Yep, that's exactly what I thought the second I read it too.

I'm also suspecting that and exchange that has very close alegiences with Blockstream Core *COUGH*^^^^Bitfinex *COUGH* helped orchestrate this."
Mapping all the connections would be an eye opener. 
"and **if exchanges do this** (this meaning: link any one team or implementation to = ""Bitcoin""), then they work to undermine the whole community

Core will probably try again to maintain their position in this ridiculous, unsuccessful power grab to steer the community for their personal profit.  There are many more sneaky and underhanded tricks they may pull next.  Stay alert."
"The trading doesn't only show the value change **in** the fork. It includes the expected probability of **the fork itself happening**.

In the meantime, Bitfinex has actually released their chain split tokens. Would you not agree that's a terrible implementation?"
Ask BeijingBitcoins about his connections in the industry
Thank you for having a more rational position about this issue.
Futures trading on BTC or BTU has already started on Bitfinex. 
Meh, I'm tired of businesses trying to be neutral towards the core and the Segwit attack. But then again, everyone I knew that used Coinbase got chased out, shut down accounts, questioned about personal shit, then just gave up and moved to a different provider.
Yo dood, respond to stuff: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/606fot/coinbase_responds_to_industry_letter/
Thank you Armstrong!
right on
"> Back channel phone calls, and building relationships with key players 

What about people that have ideas worth expressing, but don't want to bother with ""building relationships"" and backroom channels?

A conference will give voices to new people, were your private backchannel phone list will only have the same names and no new voices."
"/u/bdarmstrong, /u/jespow let me throw out an idea... There is/was talk about that the economic consensus was for small blocks, this was then compared against miner voting.

What about if we could use exchanges for doing economic voting, each user could mark their holdings for what they support, and that information could then be shared, maybe this should only show the numbers that is in the order book, but it would still be a great pointer for the miners of which path holds the most value."
"I went through a lot of confusion when Ethereum forked, and i thought at that time that pre-fork replay protection would have been a good thing.

I no longer think that way.

The original bitcoin scheme of the longest chain applies only in the absence of any replay protection.

As soon as we add replay protection, we no longer have any question of which is the longest chain. We simply have two different virtual currencies on two different chains.

And because of the above, we **should not have any replay protection**. Let the two chains have a hard and confusing fight, and let the shorter chain die quickly and let the longer chain quickly establish itself as BTC.

BTC will drop sharply in value, and will then recover. Some will panic and sell, contributing to the crash. Others will see it as an opportunity to buy low, sell high later. This won't be the first time that bitcoin has crashed (and died...) and then recovered.

BTC will eventually stabilize in value, and people will realize that “what doesn't kill you makes you stronger”, and we will end up with a strong currency, and a real currency with high capacity and stable price.

It's true that exchanges that have trading on margin will find it difficult to deal with the confusion. But they will manage, by simply suspending all trades for a while, and then resuming at the right time.

And in any case, no currency, BTC or not, should base its design on keeping margin traders happy. The margin traders should accommodate the rest of us, not the other way around. if you can't deal with the uncertainty of a hard fork, maybe you shouldn't be doing speculative things like trading on margin to begin with."
Thank you for letting us know what's going on.
I wasnt there but got confirmation from one of the presenter and another coinbase employee that he was not present. 
"""Neutral"" But your CTO tweetstorms FUD about BCU, I am confused."
Guys, everyone has an opinion. And just because the engineer doesn't have the same opinion as the boss doesn't mean he should be fired. It's good to have people with different opinions around. 
I wouldn't know, but it would be nice as an option.

"I'm just pointing out, if you weigh all the things on a scale coinbase has said on BU vs Segwit, it's obviously **NOT** neutral. And that's fine, they can say and support what they want. They just shouldn't say they're neutral.

Like my daddy always told me, don't piss on my leg and tell me it's raining."
thanks!
Feels shit to have bitstamp account, running out of options in UK.
"Different labels for split securities is old hat.  Stocks are quoted at two prices, ex dividend and with dividend.  Similarly when there is a split.

There is no need to argue about symbols across the industry.  Each exchange can use whatever legend it wants, and it is easy enough to explain the meaning of a symbol in words.  Spending a lot of time on this is just a delaying tactic and waste of resources, especially since this will probably be a one time event.  It if is not, then it will be easier to come up with neutral naming conventions at a time when things are not so political.

Excellent...
