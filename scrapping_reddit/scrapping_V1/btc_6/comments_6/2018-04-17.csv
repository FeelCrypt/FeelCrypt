"Boy is this logic flawed. Seriously though, have you not read the Bitcoin white paper? You may want to get educated on the very basics of Bitcoin, because even though you have people supporting this thinking, the majority of people who have been studying Bitcoin for a few years are just shaking their heads.

Satoshi - 2008-11-08:

“The fact that new coins are produced means the money supply increases by a planned amount, but this does not necessarily result in inflation. If the supply of money increases at the same rate that the number of people using it increases, prices remain stable. If it does not increase as fast as demand, there will be deflation and early holders of money will see its value increase. Coins have to get initially distributed somehow, and a constant rate seems like the best formula.”"

"You mention relevancy and riding on coattails, but the truth is that Bitcoin is opensource software, the relevancy and precedence comes from its origins, that Bitcoin Cash is more efficient is what is creating its fast growth. By pointing out flaws of LNcoin there is a potential for them to change their ways and become more like Bitcoin again (if they are not stubborn), but it also helps to show how Bitcoin Cash is more Bitcoin than ever. Criticism isn't an attack unless you feel defensive due to perceived weakness in this case a lack of efficiency.

Which is what hashtags are for.

I'm confused as to where he says he is purposefully using a hashtag that supports rape?

Are you literally saying that saying #metoo means you support rape, despite the fact that the words ""me too"" have always and will always mean ""I also agree"". #metoo does not mean you support rape. It has absolutely nothing to do with rape.

I don't use Twitter, I have no knowledge of what that hashtag was used for before this conversation. Let me tell you, saying #metoo doesn't mean what twitter says it means.

Read Roger's post, it's okay I'll wait, done? Great. Let's go through it together, so we are both on the same page as to what the words ""me too"" mean.

> @Falkvinge, the man who had the vision to go all in on bitcoin in 2011 is one of Bitcoin Cash’s biggest supporters today. #MeToo

So Roger is referring to someone else, and then praising them on something they have done, or an attitude they have towards a belief or cause. He also points out that he has similar views/attitude as the person he is praising because he writes ""me too"".

So if I make a tweet RIGHT NOW saying;
> @benandjerries always had such good taste in ice cream, best ideas for flavors ever #metoo

Does this mean I support rape, or does this mean I also believe I have good taste in ice cream.

Don't forget it's not time to say I'm being dumb yet so maybe link to a comment you made that doesn't answer anything I have asked."
"Do you know that for every shitcoin that is new on the market bitcoin needs to gain 10x of the shitcoins value to stay at 90% Dominance? 

If I release a shitcoin and pump it to 100million marketcap just by buying 1 of the coins for myself for 1$ (at 100 million coins supply) bitcoin would need to add 1 Billion $ to stay at 90% JUST because I invested 1 Dollar. Market dominance is not a measure of how big bitcoin is - it's a measure of how many shitcoins there are and how much the market is manipulated."

***It’s a clone of bitcoin, set aside, so that a new development team can redirect the code back to the original vision.***

It’s called a fork. Do you know what forks are for?

They’re for redirecting Bitcoin back to its original vision.  In this case, on-chain scaling as was described in the white paper.   Major, important technical aspects of Bitcoin that have been blocked by a corporation.  A corporation that came in and hired the top developers in bitcoin. So that they could force transactions ***off-chain*** and charge for them. 

You’re not aware of this? That doesn’t bother you? It doesn’t make your conscience uncomfortable? 

Maybe we have different ethics. But don’t get confused. Roger doesn’t hate bitcoin. Forks happen when the development team currently in charge fucks up. 

Forks are intended to take the ORIGINAL product and redirect it. Route around. Save the system. Yes - - you get a new ticker. 

But it’s still bitcoin."
"Cool.  So you don’t care about the social change Bitcoin was supposed to make in the world. 

And don’t acknowledge or understand that strangling on-chain scaling kills that usecase.

You’re correct. It isn’t “every“ OG.  When I said OG, I wasn’t talking about Joe miner  sitting in his parents basement in 2010.

I was talking about the biggest names in crypto, who worked directly with Satoshi.  The ones who were part of building Bitcoin. MANY of them support BCH. That has meaning.

nice propaganda tactic. what happened was that there were *many more* people supporting segwit and hesitant to do a hard fork. the moment bch crowd decided to fork off - it became an altcoin discussion.

nobody was silenced *because of their opinion on scaling*, people still talk about scaling tradeoffs on r/bitcoin without getting banned. it's the moment when you start promoting a forked coin as a bitcoin that gets you into ban territory.

> You guys... come over here and shit all over this sub like a bunch of children.

Loved this.  I want to know as well.  But one thing you learn is that people feel justified in what they are doing. They don’t think they’re doing anything wrong. 

They think they’re doing something for a good cause. They genuinely do. Maybe it’s because they have no clue the history of this debate. They’re new to crypto. Or they don’t care about the social change Bitcoin was intended to bring.  Or they want their own particular coin to win. 

There’s a thousand reasons people feel justified to do unethical things. So they don’t see this as their mom completely failing at her job. Even though we do."
"Yes I did.

1. He uses the sub he’s a mod of to promote his business (bitcoin.com) for profit. This is against reddit site wide rules.

2. The tweet I sent, because I know you’re wrong and he knew what he was doing.

3. He’s annoying 

4. Because of him I’m now interacting with you

5. The way he talks in interviews is annoying

6. The way he acts in any video I’ve seen of him is annoying

7. I dislike his personality

8. The way he acts on this sub is mostly annoying

9. He always plays the victim 

10. I can’t think of anymore right now, but maybe if I’m bored later I’ll do some more research and see what else I can find"
Those paid suckpuppets are also scammer
Or what if... people just don't like Roger Ver and that's pretty much it? 
I can't phantom real people actually doing all that. Some of them, sure. But that much stalking takes so much energy that, to me, it has to be automated. People sell their accounts for a few bucks and a few use them en mass to troll. If the majority is actually real people then that is very distressing. 
There are some people you just can't empathize with because they have zero sense of shame.
It is sad how many people would jump at the chance to do evil for money. I wish I had more faith in Karma providing Justice. I do think those who take shortcuts in life often end up without the skills needed for a good life.
They hire people that are dead broke which is why most of them have poor grammar because they live outside of developed countries and are happy with pennies a day 
Take this as you will, but what ive discovered is that they (controversy profiteers) dont even care what the controversy is, as long as theres controversy =they can get paid (double-dipping).. if they can inflame a situation they will because its more profitable...keep that in mind.
"The conspiracy theories are strong with this crowd. Maybe, just maybe, Roger  s a controversial public figure that a lot of people aren’t a fan of. Or maybe it’s the big banks and blockstream colluding to spend all their time trying to tear roger down on Reddit and Twitter.

You all have drank the kool-aid (fun historical fact I just learned: Jim Jones actually killed everyone with “flavor-aid”, so this reference is wrong), so you’re not really capable of seeing how he fights dirty with his own intentional misinformation. He’s basically on a global media campaign to tell the idiot masses that bitcoin is dead, despite over 40% market dominance. Of course people with a vested interest in bitcoin are not going to like Roger.

You all are going to self-rationalize this nonsense all the way to 0. It would be funny if it wasn’t so sad. But I’m sure writing this post helped you rationalize your beliefs against a market telling you you’re wrong (price, dwindling media coverage of BCH, etc.). Our minds value that sort of cohesion, so hopefully it gave you some comfort."
Not only sockpuppets but also evil paid scammers, they are so evil it's probably Adam himself together with his best friend Gregstream directing attacks from their trollbase. Now they do not only try to keep the blocks small but also the minds. It's disgusting. I wouldnt believe it if I haven't seen it myself.
"dont u ever hear about mtgox? google the ""mtgox scam"" and you will understand why everyone fking hate roger and everything about him. he is literally most hated person on the cryptoworld.

and no one needs to get paid to hate roger. oh, hell no."
"or maybe people ""brigade"" his comments because he and the rest of his following are insufferable pricks who circlejerk over meaningless posts like this one and spend their time bashing BTC instead of promoting BCH"
Money talks.
Sorry you are unwilling to put in the time and effort it takes to understand how bitcoin works. Don't get the bamboozles!!
There's so little focus on crypto talk in general... a pity
I tried suggesting on more than one occasion to focus on developing BCH rather than hating Bitcoin... and always managed to open the floodgates of downvotes. I am a firm small block supporter, but would love to see how far can tech be pushed if you want big blocks. Most of the stuff I'm seeing, though, is about how shit Bitcoin is.
The picture is not correct anyways. The tires are just 8 times bigger but still squared. Wake me up when bitcoin cash provides more than bigger blocks
Seems that's all it is now... Gonna unsub soon if this keeps up. No useful info here
"Yep. Riding on the coattails of BTC is the only way BCH can stay relevant.

Otherwise it's just another BTG, and who ever talks about Bitcoin Gold?"
Sadly most of BCH's success lies in people realizing that BTC is broken as a world currency for everyone. So yes, there will be lots of shit talking. 
Yep! FUDing bitcoin and perpetuating easily debunked misinformation. 
Maybe, but they aren't wrong.
/u/cryptochecker
We are shitting on Gregs Corecoin and Adams evil plans, btc is fine
"Yes, of course that is the solution. The bigger the car, the bigger the wheels.

Redditor /u/aprizm has low karma in this subreddit.
No, and that's not a problem because each person is doing their part. BTC is controlled purely by a bunch of programmers and cryptographers that don't understand the problem domain they're programming for. Bitcoin is an _economic_ system which _uses_ cryptography to help with that. It's not a purely cryptographic and programming project for the sake of it.
Man I love roger so hard man. I FUCKING LOVE HIM. I would lick his ANUS.
[BCH Supporters....](https://imgur.com/CZJOyQy)
Accurate analogy. The btc cart is full of tx' while the bcash guy doesn't even have a cart, and doesn't know what the wheels are for.
"Bitcoin Core Man #2: Rather than ""We are too busy"" it should say ""Scammer"""
Their cart had wheels once. I think Greg Maxwell is using one as a hat now.
Is this sub just people shit canning btc?
actually your solution is to use bigger wheels lol 
Love it! 
Just a quick question: Is Roger a programmer?
r/im12andthisisfunny 
I get that you're pro-Bitcoincash/anti-Bitcoin, but why do you keep pushing negativity? seems counter productive to get your product more popular by shitting on others for having different opinions. 
[removed]
"Making fun of ""BTC Supporters"" in a sub called ""BTC"". Hmm."
I like how this sub is called btc not bch :D
"The BTC guys took off the round wheels and installed the square ones. BCH: ""Hey, look, perfectly good wheels!"""
The blue circle lego piece in the middle of the block wheel really looks like the BlockStream logo and it really makes this image perfect.
The comments in here are so, so telling. They think this picture is an attack (instead of valid criticism), but then claim the picture has no argument (despite this picture being worth 1000 words) and so they remain oblivious as to why theyre so (clearly) offended by it. They're so brainwashed they cant even see the truth if it were sitting right on their nose.
"BCH fanatics know that only way to keep BCH relevant is to constantly compare it to BTC, otherwise BCH is just another BTG.

It's actually pretty sad. I own BTC and BCH in equal amounts, so I don't really care who wins, but the sheer amount of animosity from BCH against BTC is pretty staggering. Fueled by numbnuts like Ver."
And a spoon
roger why are you censoring people on twitter?
Nice picture, but what are the actual arguments ?
Haha funny but I tend to thinks it's the other way around. 
This is funny. I support both communities. I'd like to see crypto move together rather than fight but some of these memes are hilarious. 
bcasher has only wheels, no cart, no load. best analogy for the state of bcash :))
Hilarious 😂
"1. First time saying that.
2. Okay but I don't see your point (why I asked for more examples)
3. Okay, but that's the end result (you *find* him annoying, I was asking why)
4. Makes no sense, you hated him before you knew me
5. See 1
6. That's basically the same as 5, so see 1.
7. That's exactly the same as 3, (I'm assuming you've never met him personally so you are using *personally* like how people use literally)
8. That's the same as 3.
9. How so?
10. Ok.

After reading your points I've decided your opinion isn't actually worth anything to me, I was hoping on some intellectual insight as to why some people dislike him, but I will come away from this knowing you don't have any insight to give. Thanks for the experience."

"Lol pretty funny i guess it is one of those it’s funny because its true moments 

Maybe bitcoin will make a wheelbarrow next

Edit meant to say a wheelbarrow with round wheels next 😂pardon my thickness  I like bitcoin and bitcoin cash I really don’t understand a lot of the bickering over it , imo we are all on the same side . ie not the banks side 😆"
The BCH has no cart and isn't even sure what to do with the wheels so it just stands there in awe as bitcoin creates financial revolution... Someone should set up a store that only sells straws for BCH.
"Brilliant!! Love this!! :) 

My only concern to Roger u/MemoryDealers is that the branding on the bitcoin.com website still seems very supportive of BTC instead of BCH. For example, these two things immediately stand out to me:

1. On the homepage, there is an extremely large price chart for BTC but absolutely no price chart at all for BCH.

2. The entire website is still branded with the color orange instead of green, which seems to indicate BTC to me... especially after looking at the great cartoon above."
BTC be haulin' a cart full of Lego dildos.
good game Roger
This.
Given our large block size, I think there should be one BTC and two BCH people!

"No. Roger is not anti-Bitcoin. That proves you don’t know what this is about and you’ve been listening to your overlords tell you what to think. 

Doesn’t freak you out a little bit? That you don’t even understand the basics of what this is about? 

That you’re getting lied to, and you don’t even have the brains to actually question what you’re being told?

Roger supports bitcoin. What he doesn’t support is a corporation coming in and controlling the direction of the code, strangling on chain scaling, and nullifying bitcoins social change in the world. 

All of those things are happening. Which is exactly why every OG in the fucking ecosystem supports bitcoin cash right now, not just Roger. 

Do you even know any of this?"

"I think if he did know what it mean't he likely wouldn't have done it, there is an army of people sitting at their computer watching everything he does. Do you think he would make such a huge mistake if it was intentional.

Maybe, but I withhold my judgement until either side is proven, I'm simply playing devil's advocate here trying to understand why this guy hates Roger so much.

I also had absolutely no knowledge of this movement until just now, so I am probably seeing it from my point of view, and relating to something that might not even be there."
So what happens when you need to build too big of a car or too big of a wheel? Or you just don't have the power to drive forward the giant level car and wheels?
good bot
"I guess I'm just trying to show you that just because you know what the majority of people who use that hashtag use it for that meaning, doesn't mean every use of it is used for that purpose.

And just because Roger knew it was trending doesn't mean he knew that the reason. I wouldn't have known if I saw it trending. I also wouldn't have looked it up because I know that the words ""me too"" mean I agree, and I would use it for agreement.

If he did know it was for that then I would agree with you that it is in terrible taste to use it, but I'm guessing he didn't, but I would be open to be proven wrong.

You on the other hand have convinced yourself that he knew what it meant without have evidence, you also tried to convince me that he did using a comment he made that in no way showed he did.


So once again why do you hate him so much? "
Thank god he’s not.  Look what programmers being in charge did to Bitcoins market share.
">listening to your overlords

nice.

his current sentiment (which is very obvious, it's not a secret or anything) is that he has turned his attention from Bitcoin in favor of BitcoinCash, this post itself is proof of him having negative sentiment towards Bitcoin - ``every OG in the fucking ecosystem supports bitcoin cash right now, not just Roger.`` I wouldn't class myself as an ""OG"" but i have been following BTC for a while, it is wrong to disregard someone else's opinion based on their length of network use, and blindly follow those that are ""OG""."
">every OG in the fucking ecosystem supports bitcoin cash right now, not just Roger. 

Fucking lies.

I've been around since late 2010. I mined on Slushpool, used MtGox before Mark bought it, bought Alpaca socks and Capucin coffee, bought bitcoin on Bitcoin-OTC, remember when Atlas started r/bitcoin. I feel like I'm pretty OG and I absolutely do not support Bitcoin Cash, in fact I sold most of mine."
"You think this is Harry Potter vs Voldemort where one can't live if the other survives, but in reality BTC and BCH are Harry & Ron. They're rivals, but in a constructive way. If one wins, they both win. 

You've gotta stop the 'us vs them' narrative and grow up a bit. You're fuelling a fire which has the potential to burn down the whole village. Sit back, relax and let yourself go. Positive vibes my friend, for all. "
You shit on btc in btc-subreddit and get props for it? Whats wrong here?
"just like how you keep promoting craig wright, the proven lying scammer?

liars/scammers stick together.  nice blocking/censorship on twitter, hypocrite."
"LOL, Bcash pointless coin...
"
More side stepping. Still no response to my questions. 
Is it ok to bully and tease people with mental disabilities if you are biggest promoter of the special olympics? BCH doesn’t need this kind of promoter.
they are out in full force today
"Blc? Bacon, lettuce, cucumber?

Terrible fake account my dude. "
Bitcoin core supporters and Bitcoin ABC supporters * fixed for you
First off, I have nothing against Roger at all. But looking at his Twitter history, he never uses hashtags for common phrases like “I agree.” Do you truly believe it was just coincidence that he happened to tag “metoo” during this movement or did he maybe know what he was doing? With that said, only people in the public eye would draw criticism for this... no one would care if you or I did it. Roger is smart, I don’t blame him one bit. Do you agree?
"We've all heard all your petty little excuses - Bitcoin got derailed, Bitcoin Cash is the true Bitcoin! /r/Bitcoin is full of censorship! Bitcoin is full of corrupt assholes! Waaaaaah!

Now you need to understand that at the end of the day, BTC and BCH have taken two completely different paths. The reason BCH is adamant on constantly barking at BTC, is because that's the only way it was stay relevant - in the shadow of BTC.

Now grow up and move on. 

I wish both BTC and BCH success, but I hope users like you and Ver fall and break your nose."
Redditor /u/braitacc has low karma in this subreddit.
I'd actually say BCH is a decent sized dog. But it doesn't need to bark - yet it chooses to do so, fueled by stupidity.
I found the photo amusing because it reflects reality.  I’m still just as busy as ever promoting Bitcoin. (BCH)
... op_codes?
So you're awake now then
You must love Microsoft
"Because that's not ""different opinion"", at this point this is being anti-science and pure illogical, that hurts an entire community; just like anti-vaxxers' ""opinions""."
Like he's going to answer you honeydew, you are a liability. Your neckbeard is sticking out of your shirt
Quite amusing cult-like dissonance
It shows both kinds of BTC supporters. Bitcoin Core supporters and Bitcoin Cash supporters.
"It is called that because /r/bitcoin banned everyone who would talk about bitcoins scalability problem. This started many years ago before BCH. These people migrated to this subreddit. It just so happens BCH falls in line with what most people here think is the real bitcoin.

Pretty crazy how few people know this. "
"Good. People like you annoy me, so let's just never talk to each other again.

I mean you still never gave me any good reasons, after I asked what 4 or 5 times? You gave me one tweet that I deducted as a mistake."
It is because /r/bitcoin has banned any disucssion of a scaling solution (besides LN) since like 2015. Everyone that was banned migrated to this subreddit, which has exsisted much longer than BCH. It just so happens that BCH falls in line with what most that were banned think is the real Bitcoin.
There is a huge reason for the animosity and if you cant or dont understand why then it shows you dont undertstand the reason for the rift very well, you should do some more research
This sub likes to compare so : You have one big badass dog and a small shitty dog.  Guess which one is barking the most? The little shitty one which is BCH. This is nature. BCH is the shitty one so its strategy is to shit talk BTC.
"It is called that because /r/bitcoin banned everyone who would talk about bitcoins scalability problem. This started many years ago before BCH. These people migrated to this subreddit. It just so happens BCH falls in line with what most people here think is the real bitcoin.

There was a fork
That's pretty good. We have the great idea and a plan to use it. I like our chances since your side promised to never use the idea, lol. We can build the cart. Remember, we did try to offer (beg you to use) the wheels for everyone's cart first.

"despite 40% market dominance?

You realize that it was 100% first? Then 90%. Then 80%. Then 70%. Then 60-50-40% with a brief foray into the 30’s. "
"Why is it always somebody who’s only been around for a year that thinks BCH is a joke?

We’ve all been here since 2012 or earlier, and Satoshi‘s right-hand man Gavin Andresen even supports BCH. As does Vitalik Buterin, creator of Ethereum, Coinbase, Gemini soon, and the biggest merchant processing company in the entire bitcoin world. BitPay.

Are they all drinking the Kool-Aid as well? Or do you actually think you know better than every one of them?"
Of course this aren't real people trolling because only people that are getting easily triggered or something like that are getting trolled and Roger has such a  good smelling cute pink anus how can someone dislike him and bitcoin CASH anyway at all *claps rogers butt* ?
Word
Then why debase themselves by hounding his every move?  Obsessed much?  It shows that they have poor character, there’s no way around that fact.
Well Roger's been kind of a dick about his Altcoin, BCash. 
Right, here I am bashing roger for free like a sucker
If that is enough to stalk him everywhere with personal attacks, then that still reflects very poorly on that person
"Saying there are paid sockpuppets in crypto is about as accurate as right-wingers crying ""paid protestors"" every time they see a dem with a sign. These are INVESTORS with invested money riding on a crypto (BTC, in this case). Just like yall, they claim their invested crypto is better. Please stop with this claim that the other side is ""paid off,"" it undermines the legitimacy of the whole cryptosphere.

Edit: I'm defending crypto and getting downvoted. Wtf is this sub."
"I mean it’s pretty obvious he knew. If you look at every reply in that thread they all knew exactly what he meant and they’re all calling him out on it. 

I think you’re really over exaggerating how much effort I put into disliking him. I don’t hate him “so much”. he’s just a shit person and he annoys me 90% of the time I see him post anything on Reddit so I like to call him out when it comes up. 

Honestly people like you annoy me way more than he does anyways. "
Unlikely. Would you go to such lengths as creating countless sockpuppet accounts just for that?
