I completely agree on that don't get me wrong - for now it'll be an alternative at most. maybe replacement but I honestly don't see that happening in <10 years. So why not try to profit from it, you know?
Litecoin is your answer. I'm a little confused about whether or not segwit will make bitcoin like litecoin, though. I don't understand enough about it

"I don't agree,  Litecoin is not the answer because it has segwit also.  segwit could in fact be a fatal flaw.   We won't know for some time, but if the corporations and these developers who keep trying to make things over complex get their way they will turn Bitcoin into a Rub Goldberg machine.  

Bitcoin works that way it is, we just need bigger blocks.  

Bitcoin cash is better than litecoin for the reason of distribution.  

Satoshi owns bitcoin cash, like it or not.  

Every bitcoin holder, every old school investor and supporter owns bitcoin cash,  for that reason bitcoin cash is an already deployed Plan B.  

So if Segwit is a poison pill, or if they make bitcoin expensive to use it will die.  

Bitcoin cash is already distributed in a fair way and ready to become the whole network as soon as that is needed. 

You think the bitcoin cash fork was politically messy?  just wait for the next fork of bitcoin when they don't implement the 2x part of segwit 2x.    We will look back to the bitcoin cash fork as the fast easy politically correct fork.  

What is coming up for bitcoin is going to be some major mud slinging and it's going to get personal.

No. Given that his contribution to bitcoin is, at this point, both negative and of great magnitude, very few people did less than him for bitcoin."
"People go through all these arguments in the numerous bitcointalk threads on the topic. The Bitcoins are being held by the forum for use in the future. Obviously 300k is more than enough to upgrade a forum, you don't need first hand experience writing javascript or PHP to know that. 

If Theymos was a scammer they would have taken the 6k bitcoins and run, leaving Bitcointalk dead in the water. They haven't. They still post regularly. Bitcointalk continues to function.

"Censorship is when the state or content controller removes things. Moderation is when someone removes content unfit for the current forum.

A mod can't censor since you are still free to express yourself. Just not on that forum.

When you are censored you are forbidden from voicing an opinion at all. 

It's a matter of scale and to some extent a matter of intent. As there are hundreds of posts regarding big blockers, bitcoin cash, bitcoin unlimited and friends on rbitcoin I fail to see how it could be censored in regards to content. 

Just because some people don't agree with you and don't follow your narrative and perhaps don't want cooypasta spam from a vocal minority doesn't mean it's censored nor that it's evil.

People talk about all things bitcoin all the time on rbitcoin. Some people are banned due to toxic behavior. That's moderation not censorship."

Absolutely not, it's just that Bitcoin isn't unique on Reddit. Almost every sub-reddit above a size is heavily censored. Gotta protect the bottom line.

"Bitcointalk.org was the main and possibly only bitcoin discussion forum for a long time. People only moved to reddit later when the forum's stream of comments with no voting setup became seriously annoying.

When I donated (10 bitcoins maybe, I don't even remember) they were worth less than $100. I don't regret it a bit, and in no way feel like I have been scammed.

While I don't necessarily agree with every decision Theymos has made, I do know that he has done more for the Bitcoin community than most people, especially the OP who just recreates this thread on almost a daily basis and does nothing but insult people."

That presumes he dumped all his bitcoin he scammed back when it hit bottom and that he's not sitting on millions of dollars worth.

He's a scammer.   "

Anything that prevents the propagation of information or ideas is an apparatus of censorship.
"What are your definitions of ""censorship"" and ""moderation""?

When I think of censorship, I think of using non-transparent tools to silence people for the purpose of making it so it's less likely that other people will encounter their opinions and change their mind as a result. Moderation, on the other hand, is a word I associate with transparent acts related to keeping a forum on-topic or removing spam. With those definitions, I'd say that r/Bitcoin (and many other subreddits) do things more reminiscent of censorship than of moderation."

Can you elaborate on what's wrong with his comment?
">Censorship is a state depriving it's citizen if speech or information.

I respect the fact that you can make your own definitions, but just to be clear this isn't consistent with common usage. As an English speaker, I'm sure you're aware that ""government censorship"" is a collocation. Sequences of words don't become collocations when they're entirely redundant. Imagine saying ""government censorship"" while operating under your definition. It would sound like saying ""wooden tree"".

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Censorship&oldid=793453313) defines the term in this way:

>Censorship is the suppression of speech, public communication, or other information that may be considered objectionable, harmful, sensitive, politically incorrect or inconvenient as determined by governments, media outlets, authorities or other groups or institutions.

A subreddit at the very least falls under the category ""other groups or institutions"". If a moderation policy is such that systematic suppression of certain dissenting opinions is carried out, then I don't see why that wouldn't be considered ""censorship"" by the normal sense of the term, even if we assume that it's not all that big of a deal for the moderators of r/Bitcoin to do what they're doing.

It sound like you're trying to create an argument on lines of morality, legality, and so forth. Sure, a forum is a ""private entity"", which for all of us who subscribe to libertarian views should trigger our minds to the [auto-complete](http://lesswrong.com/lw/k5/cached_thoughts/), ""They can do whatever they want on their own property."" I have no problem with that. And yeah, okay, Reddit as a private company ""explicitly allows for clients to moderate forums according to their own judgment"", which is something we must respect as people uninterested in asking for State interference. But what's your point? That we can't complain about it, call it ""censorship"", say that they're attempting to control the narrative with nefarious means, etc?

>I don't agree with some of the heavy moderation going on but I also fully endorse removing aggressive toxic posts made by angry young men regardless of which ""side"" said asshat is on.

I mostly agree. My only issue is transparency. I'd like to see a forum structured such that the moderators can systematically remove inflammatory or off-topic posts, but where anyone can click a button and be brought to a version of the thread where all the posts are intact. Perhaps one would still be able to converse within that thread, but it wouldn't count for karma, meaning the incentive would be to post in the cleaned-up thread. Trolls and assholes could be kept at bay without running the risk of a few individuals being given the keys to a machine that can drive the narrative in a whole community."
Welcome to /r/btc. You must be new here.
"It sounds like you're more concerned with the tone than the content. I agree that the way he delivered his opinions wasn't exactly optimal, but if you look at the content it seems reasonable.

Forums are by nature structured in specific ways which incentivize certain kinds of behavior. Reddit isn't exactly a platform which makes it likely for group psychology to go in a direction that should be in agreement with the cyberpunk sentimentality. The ability to shadowban is just one of those aspects. Transparency is lacking on Reddit, due to the way it's set up."
Hi there fellow Redditor. I don't think you choose kind words. Please allow me to strap on my seatbelt before you insult me too. 
Lol.  You mad bro?
Yes, anyone who disagree with you is automatically a retard. Must be great to live in your head.
"No it is very very different. The government is the public sector. They make the laws and is a representative of the people. Since the state is so powerful modern civilizations have shackled the state to constitutions, democratic processes and accountability.

A company (or in some ways a forum) is a private entity that operates inside the law. A company is beholden to its owners. Not the employees nor the customers. A company HAS freedom of speech, it does need to GIVE someone else a platform for freedom of speech.

Censorship is a state depriving it's citizen if speech or information. A company removing (by proxy on reddit) someone's post isn't censorship because there is no freedom of speech on a privately owned, non regulated, service.

You are the state, you are not reddit. Reddit explicitly allows for clients to moderate forums according to their own judgement. This is therefore morally and legally just. If you don't like it you can start your own sub in like 3 seconds or just argue here on rbtc.

I don't agree with some of the heavy moderation going on but I also fully endorse removing aggressive toxic posts made by angry young men regardless of which ""side"" said asshat is on."
It's overly lengthy melodramatic obsessive drama that completely overblown any genuine issue without actually understanding what the real issues are.

"Seriously though there are many many posts either on Reddit or bitcointalk.org about angy people wanting either a result with his ""new"" website from the donations or asking for a refund or asking to see the money on the blockchain etc etc. but Theymos never delivered anything."
You're either an idiot or a shill. Which is it?
You are functionally retarded. Don't have any more children.
The difference is merely one of scale. If a government censors your attempt to publish a book, you just got kicked off a book-disseminating platform which has millions upon millions of people who can't or won't go to any other such platform. You could publish in another country, but you've been functionally silenced in a very significant way. However, if a moderator censors you on a forum, it just got a bit more annoying to try to participate within a platform of a comparatively small number of people, many of which are likely to read other platforms anyway. In other words, government censorship is more dangerous simply because it's a much more centralized system where a single decision has a much more significant effect. Reddit and forum culture in general is decentralized to a larger degree, meaning that any one decision is less important.

"I agree with you, I was just saying that the thermus already did far more damage than he did good to bitcoin.

Plus, it was not him setting up the forum. He has user id #35 iirc. You can still find some of the first users actively being present on the internet. They don't pull ranks, are not power grabbing possessive kids like theymos.

Theymos is the typical kid that does everything to be a moderator on a web forum. I don't even think he owns many bitcoins since looooong ago. Appart from those 6000 he begged for."
"True you can scam in a lot of ways.

If Theymos has removed money from the donations and used them for ANYTHING not related to bitcointalk, or without explaining what the funds were used for, then I would call him a scammer.

The thing is I can't see any evidence (in terms of Bitcoin transactions) that the donated coins have moved. Until they actually move there is no evidence of scamming and Theymos is sticking to what they claimed in the numerous threads... namely that the forums are holding the coins for future use."
Have you considered how you may look to other people when calling someone juvenile with wording which is itself juvenile? I understand why you may be angry, but I really don't think your comment is helpful.

lol wrong thread. sorry. Don't play dumb, or lazy. Be informed, /u/theymos is a scammer.
I respect your opinion, however I really doubt Bitcoin would have made it to where it is today without the strong bitcointalk community that formed early on. There was no /r/bitcoin or /r/btc. If you wanted information on Bitcoin that was where you went. I was around when Satoshi was still posting there, the famous bitcoin for pizza trade happened there. While no doubt things have changed, it would be silly to ignore the past. 
Why would the forum need 6K BTC *and* donations *and* advertisements on every page? Makes no sense. You don’t have to run away with money to be called a scammer.
You have a childlike mind. Maybe you are 12. Fuck off little kid.
">A mod can't censor since you are still free to express yourself. Just not on that forum.

""A government official acting on behalf of State policy can't censor you, since you are still free to express yourself. Just not in that country.""

I'm not sure that it makes sense to define the term ""censorship"" to mean that you're forbidden from voicing an opinion at all, rather than just forbidden to voice an opinion within a given venue. That would make almost all historical usages of the term ""censorship"" no longer correct, as it's been very common for people to describe, say, suppression of a book as ""censorship"", even if they could talk about the same topics in their meet-up groups with no issues."

"The post may be true, but the OP's attitude isn't doing himself, anyone else, or rbtc any favors.   People who have never heard of this before who are simply asking for more information are being replied to with profanities and having their intelligence insulted.

There's also the fact that, in his attempt to support Bitcoin Cash, he's blatantly and falsely claiming that the original Bitcoin is the one that's crashing while Bitcoin Cash isn't.   This can easily be disproven by simply searching the price of Bitcoin since the fork (Has gone up from ~$2750 to ~$3250) and the price of Bitcoin Cash since the fork (which has dropped from $360 at the time of the fork to settle at around $260).

I'm not trying to get into the whole debate about which coin is ""better"" or whatever.  But having people who are blatantly insulting others who don't just blindly support your cause, dropping profanities instead of information, and supporting their case with provably false information is not going to do anyone any favors.

IMO, OP should be written off as a troll; even if the information he's providing is factually correct, his handling of the matter has no business in serious discussion of the topic.

Yeah, r/Bitcoin is just higher stakes than most subreddits.
"Pretty sure in the bitcointalk threads about this it states that bitcointalk still has the vast majority of those coins.

"Theymos is doing more damage than good, to the Core team, and the SegWit implementation progress.

A lot of the negative vibe around Core, and SegWit, has been caused by the creation of 2 opposite facing camps. At some point, the effort to keep the community solid, has switched to actively block different views.

So if you really hate SegWit, you should thank Theymos for doing the PR around it. Who knows it might have already be implemented, if the communication, discussion etc around it was more open and friendly. "

The mods decide on a subreddits rules. It's that simple. It isn't censorship, it's moderation. You are always free to start your own sub and run it like you please. Reddit staff are hands off until laws or site wide rules are broken. It's a good thing most of the time.
"Spez himself has changed users comments without their knowledge because they hurt his fee fees.

It doesn't have to be the sole source. If it spreads bad information and misleads newcomers,  that's worth calling out.
That's the thing, all of this is out in the open. It may not attract a huge amount of interest outside of crypto now, but when the History of Bitcoin is written years from now, the evidence of censorship—and its very real real-world repercussions for Bitcoin—will be made apparent. I have zero doubt about that.

"Are you implying that I am somehow being directed by someone else in my use of this subreddit? Not everyone who disagrees with you are paid to do so. Some people (like myself) have been part of this community for a very long time and just think you're all very stupid.

Maybe you should go back to being paid to retweet stupid shit Roger says."
Why are you so excited? Why are you so hell bent on proving another person wrong? Please convince yourself you are right first and please then convince me too.
"1. Downvotes aren't censorship
2. I'm not morally obligated to upvote people I disagree with, lol"
Thanks. You just helped me prove a point.
There is a different between communication and information. There are ton of bitcoin websites, but there are only a few big forums you can go and ask questions/opinions.
"I'm tired and haven't reviewed but this is what i found within a minute: 
https://forum.bitcoin.com/post32869.html#p32869"
Blockstream benefits from the current 1mb limit. Theymos starts heavily banning/censoring right when bitcoinxt comes on the scene. 
"If someone asked me to prove to them that being splashed with water makes you wet, I might think about it for a second or two but I don't think I would take the time to explain it to them; it's just too obviously true. And if they're questioning something that is so obviously and trivially true, then nothing I could possibly say would matter anyway."
"If we're talking censorship and banning there's always r/latestagecapitalism...


"
Yeah I learned about this thanks to /r/bitcoin. The comments that got moderated were incredibly benign and just pointing out hard facts of altcoin market caps.
"> propaganda is a dangerous and powerful tool in the right, financed hands.

Well financed hands: Jihan, Roger

Propoganda: This sub, where Roger happens to be a moderator. 

> Propaganda has been a weapon against public opinion for hundreds of years.

Why is this even in your response? Did you think I though propaganda was new? Or is this comment a Red herring and a nice way to segway into getting the focus back to the propaganda against blockstream? You do realize that your ""good stuff"" comment could be considered propaganda right? 

Hence, the 'You're projecting' comment I made. "

Me too, the first big cash out stage is potentially on the horizon. 
That's me. I call it like i see it. My insight got me banned from r/bitcoin very soon after that.  
Deep web was pretty mercenary as well, until the FBI one day popped it.

"> Strategy for what?

What do you think we're discussing here? Eh, never mind. Continue living your life."
"You did say essentially that downvoting is censoring, but I'm glad you take that back.  

Now that you've took it back, what are you complaining about exactly? "
"""Theymos is under the influence of Blockstream"" is not self-evident. Which is why I asked for evidence. Which you can't seem to provide. The only thing I can assume is that there isn't any."
"So you are saying you made it all up and have no evidence.

As clearly everything is censored on the website you say is under the control of someone under the control of blockstream.

As one is clearly not true, how can you claim the others are true?

That is not *evidence* that he is under control of Blockstream. It is merely more conjecture.
What was your point exactly?
Funny how they complain about censorship and being misled yet they are guilty of the exact same thing 
Do you really think you're the first to do this? Do you think you're some kind of pioneer here?
No, it's not.
Next thing you know, they're going to start linking [Pepe Silvia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nTpsv9PNqo) to Blockstream.
This guy isn't here to ask real questions.
Worthless as it neither disproves anything stated here nor explains your entire history which led to that specific instance. The fact that you present it in this manner however is indicative of why it is that way.
You guys are a hoot.
You're not special. People have been complaining about Theymos for years. Find a new strategy, cause this one ain't working. Or, you know, don't. 
Also, this is just precious: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2fwciq/advice_on_bitcoin_related_website/
none taken :)  I liked /u/D-Lux 's idea and just took it a little step further. I might just buy one myself!
Not paid? Interning? Even worse!
Read what the OP links to. That is a good start for the proof that you are claiming you need.
Listen. i don't care. I gave you a starting point, so why don't you try and use that half brain cell of yours and find something better yourself. You know... try to think for yourself for a change. I'm sure you can do it!
"No i haven't. I've been trying to figure out why Core kept the block limit and hightailed out of rbitcoin as soon as i figured out what was going on. 

I've only now recently started exposing him/them because i hate to see people make uninformed decisions.

EDIT: wrote rbtc instead of rbitcoin"
No one gets downvoted here just for supporting bitcoin. 
"no problem. glad you liked it

it's pretty damning though. not?"
[How's this for a start](http://i.imgur.com/07ONfOE.png)?
I'm not obliged to collect and spoon-feed you evidence that is all around you. I'm not going to waste my time with someone who is being willfully ignorant. I would say the same to a flat-earther or creationist.
"> ""Theymos is under the influence of Blockstream"" is not self-evident.

Check out the links OP posted. It's more than enough evidence. 

Unless, of course, you are playing stupid to derail discussion."

" Let's start small here. You've been ""exposing"" theymos for a couple years now. How would you say that's going?"
Im not telling you to upvote people. Im saying you should try to accept different opinions if you want a bitcoin sub, not a bitcoin Cash fanpage. 
Im saying that downvoting people just because they like bitcoin more will make this a worse echochamber than The Donald. 
Good. You need help. 
">I'm tired and haven't reviewed

Confidence inspiring! 

I asked for your most damning evidence. If that's, then it's pathetic."
We all like Bitcoin, we just dislike Witcoin.
think about all those ppl who just dumped their bcc at a firesale 94% off price b/c blockstream core told them to.  rdy for some lawsuits???
Yeah, seriously kicking ass alright. With your limp dicked fork that's being peddled by Fake Satoshi and other various nobodies, and dropping in value every day. 
"Thanks! I can continue converting my BTC for BCH now. Good luck with the cornslutting sub; beautifully done."
"I was permanently banned about a year ago and still have no idea why. I asked the mods and they came up with some half-hearted excuse about lack of karma, but aside from questioning the small-block rationality, I was always respectful, didn't use potty language or have a habit of insulting people, etc. 

My guess is that there are hundreds—probably at this point thousands—with a similar story. 

I've been wanting to do this, but haven't had the time, but ... Someone should make a **Banned from r/ bitcoin** t-shirt.  I'd pay for one, and would wear it proudly. Especially at crypto conferences and meetups, etc. 

The idea wouldn't just be to publicize this free-speech abomination, but to let others know that those who are being banned aren't ax-wielding, ear-biting lunatics, but regular people who have been silenced for no acceptable reason. "

"> If anything this should be a powerful lesson as to why propaganda is a dangerous and powerful tool in the right, financed hands.

You're projecting. "
"Yes. I joined reddit in order to join the other subreddit. Back then, there were ca 7000 subscribers there. And discussions were good.


I unsuscribed over a year ago, and I basically never even visit anymore. The signal/noise ratio is too low."
"> Old timer here.

> /u/singularity87

Confirmed. In Bitcoin since 2010. 

Every word /u/singularity87 and /u/tsontar said are the truth."
"I'm also an old timer (this is not my original account, but I've been around since mid 2011). This is absolutely the truth about that sub.

Honestly, you can make an argument that this sub is really negative or whiney or whatever, but AT THE VERY LEAST, there is discussion. Lots of discussion. The other sub is just memes and twitter feeds. It makes me sad cuz that place used to be online home."

"Ditto. Pretty spot on based on my experience. I've personally had comments over there ""moderated"" where I can see them but nobody else can."
This is accurate.  I saw it all happen myself.
A very convincing argument
Lol
Any weirder ones? (Genuine question)

As far as I know it's the biggest Bitcoin community on the internet, and it's not just /r/Bitcoin it's also bitcoin.org and bitcointalk.com, the other two biggest. All owned by the same person, a person obviously under the influence of the Blockstream corporation.
"Hey! Haven't seen your name in a long while.

I just re-read your ""goodbye"" post. It was probably a good choice to dip out of the social/political mess of Bitcoin, but I hope it didn't make you give up on the tech itself.

Best of luck."
In my opinion that was a large driver in the creation of a chain split, to get free from that control 
sorry i dont have time to read all that right now so until i do ill have to remain a sheep
"This sub needs to grow up beyond complaining about theymos, if it wants to be relevant. Add something to the party. Your new fork is dying on the vine, and you're still upvoting complaints about crap that happened in 2015. Get it together.

Edit: Downvoting babies gonna downvote, just like the market is downvoting bitcoin cash."
"Good stuff, and 100% accurate.

I remember distinctly that Bitcoin XT was the catalyst for a massive and glaring shift in sentiment on the sub and that is when everything changed. 

Unfortunately they basically won for the moment. They got SegWit, they got the market cap, they got the ""main stream"" communication channels, they got the repo, and they got the brand. It's a massive bait and switch.

If anything this should be a powerful lesson as to why propaganda is a dangerous and powerful tool in the right, financed hands.

/u/singularity87 you should post that on steemit.  Permanent record on a blockchain. Bet you would make some $$$ off of it there too.

"I think the information that you guys are promoting about r/bitcoin is good, but you are not welcoming those with other opinions either.

As long as 70% of the posts on this sub are anti bitcoin and pro bitcoin cash, you have a problem. Im pretty new to the community and I find it hard to believe that the ?uncencored? bitcoin subreddit is tilting so much over to bitcoin cash when regular bitcoin clearly has more support. 

You can say that you isnt cencoring, but I personally feel that attacking and downvoting people to -20 for supporting the other chain is one side of the same coin. We want to encourage people with other opinions to comment. But when you talk shitt to them you svare them away.

Sorry for my crappy english"
[deleted]
This is a pretty good account, but also pretty biased if you ask me
Amazingly thorough and accurate writeup.
No, of course not. r/btc are conspiracy theorists who like their little echo chamber where they talk about Axa, Bilderberg, Blockstream and the Illuminati taking over Bitcoin. For the powerful cartel of ASIC manufacturers and mining farms, r/btc are just useful idiots. Asicboost was the real reason the cartel sabotaged SegWit and spammed the Bitcoin blockchain for months.
How permanent is it though, I understand steemit to have been a bit of an ICO scam with 90% power going to owners
We say that downvoting isn't censoring, because it isn't.
Why do you guys who like censorship resistant money hate censorship so much? Really?
We came to bitcoin because it promises to a better censorship resistant! and the same people who control bitcoin communication channel do the opposite of that.
"Projecting what?

Propaganda has been a weapon against public opinion for hundreds of years. Blockstream may be new but these basic tactics of narrative and information control are not. 

"
Not quite as greybearded as some of the folks around here and you won't recognise me, but I witnessed most of what you described.
I witness you brother.
Thank you! Great post!
"Same thing here. r/bitcoin was what introduced me to reddit actually. 

It's so disappointing seeing what's being done to Bitcoin."
That's the way moderation usually works on reddit. They don't delete your comment but it's invisible to everyone else. All the highly moderated subs do that on a regular basis. The difference with r/bitcoin is that the moderation rules aren't transparent.
[removed]
Well about as permanent as bitcoin.  Theoretically something could be forked out if all the witnesses agree but I don't see that happening for anything outside of a massive child porn dump or something like that.
"What do you think is the *most* damning evidence that Theymos is under the influence Blockstream? Like, give me your most convincing arguments.

edit... If this is what your subreddit considers evidence, then it's no wonder you believe oft-repeated lies and untruths."
[deleted]
Not saying that it is censorship, but you end up with a community that is no no need to censor because everyone has the same opinion.
"I can and I will blame you. Sometimes you just gotta rise above and do the right thing. The r/bitcoin users already show willingness to try a new sub when they visit here, and I think you guys should try to contain youselfs aswell. 

I doubt people want censorship here. Just because Theymos banned some people doesnt mean you should downvote everyone with the same opinion as him. "
[deleted]
"/r/btc wouldn't exist if it wasn't for the censorship on /r/Bitcoin. 

It's a little frustrating when you try to inform people of the different viewpoints that exist besides those of Core and the motivation behind the small block issue and you get booted for your troubles but i don't really care; i kinda liked the irony of it. "
"Not really. It's not a matter of rejecting other opinions either. 

I have tried many many times to get a coherent answer from a small blocker as to why exactly they promote smaller blocks and want to make Bitcoin into a settlement system (aka a Bitcoin alt). The reason is that there isn't any. They just parrot in the echo chamber that is /r/Bitcoin. Watch this; i'm going to reply to /u/beer--warrior below your comment to prove my point."
Looking forward to the next bitcoin fork... 
Are you suggesting that censorship isn't happening right now? And are you saying that exposing the censorship on /r/Bitcoin isn't relevant right now?
The good thing is that you can see the other 30% of the posts here.
When people are banned from /r/Bitcoin (for very specific opinions) they come here. So it's natural that this sub would tilt towards those opinions. Don't blame us what what Theymos caused.
"> when regular bitcoin clearly has more support. 

It seems that way now, but when the network splits again into segwit1x and segwit2x, I think bitcoin cash will have the biggest community."
Thats a lot like how I feel.
I don't really have a problem with that tool. It's even open source. It would be pretty easy to fork it and make one that does the opposite.
/r/btc is currently kicking ass and taking names. Shoo, shoo, concern troll.

"As adoption grows, it is only natural that the UTXO table would increase. Not only do you have more users, but the old users may want to split their coins as they grow in value. 

The *whole point* of segwit is to make coin splitting expensive, and by extension, on-chain transactions risky. (I personally don't really trust my computer with more than about $1000).
"
"I figured out a simpler reason for AXA to push segwit:

> **Reducing UTXO growth**

> The Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) database is maintained by each validating Bitcoin node in order to determine whether new transactions are valid or fraudulent. For efficient operation of the network, this database needs to be very quick to query and modify, and should ideally be able to fit in main memory (RAM), so keeping the database’s size in bytes as small as possible is valuable.

> This becomes more difficult as Bitcoin grows, as each new user must have at least one UTXO entry of their own and will prefer having multiple entries to help improve their privacy and flexibility, or to provide as backing for payment channels or other smart contracts.

> Segwit improves the situation here by making signature data, which does not impact the UTXO set size, cost 75% less than data that does impact the UTXO set size. This is expected to encourage users to favour the use of transactions that minimise impact on the UTXO set in order to minimise fees, and to encourage developers to design smart contracts and new features in a way that will also minimise the impact on the UTXO set.

[Segregated Witness Benefits](https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/01/26/segwit-benefits/)

As adoption grows, it is only natural that the UTXO table would increase. Not only do you have more users, but the old users may want to split their coins as they grow in value. 

The *whole point* of segwit is to make coin splitting expensive, and by extension, on-chain transactions risky. (I personally don't really trust my computer with more than about $1000).
