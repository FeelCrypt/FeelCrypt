Considering all the shady noise around Wright's activities (assuming any bit of it is true), I hope he's not Satoshi. Still, I don't think that necessarily makes it less likely. SN's just a person or persons, after all, and he/she/they is/are likely just as flawed as the next guy(s).

"Great points. In the same vein, I'd like for you to observe that nothing that has been presented here so far has shown than I, itsnotlupus, am not Satoshi.

So I'd appreciate if everybody kept an open mind about me being Satoshi, and wait for time to bring out the truth on this as well.

Thank you.

"What do you understand about Satoshi Nakamoto?

- Intelligent
- Voluntarist
- Believes in giving power back to the people
- Privacy-centric

Now what do you understand about Craig White?

- Millionaire (and materialistic)?
- Media spinner?
- Showboat?

I don't see how SN can be this man called Craig White. This is all anecdotal, the empirical stuff is even more compelling. "
lol great point. WHO is it always?
"Funny that Bitcoiners, while advocating for and dreaming about wide scale bitcoin adoption, seems to actively seek reasons to dump.

Most people in bitcoin are f'ing pussies."
Actually, if I was satoshi, and I had tax problems, I would have dumped my BTC BEFORE coming out as Satoshi, right? I mean, the aim would be to get the best price for my bitcoins.
"Adam Black?

Dude, you just really widened the field by a huge number of interesting candidates.

> adult clown

> money fan, capitalist pirate"
"Adam Black is already stretching the truth as far as shame will allow to ride the Satoshi coat-tail, with his twitter describing him as:

> inventor of hashcash (bitcoin is hashcash extended with inflation control)

Bitcoin is literally just something Adam Black invented, with some tweaks some nobody that goes by ""Satoshi"" added.

It's safe to say taht if he could have put himself even more center stage, he would have.

"> While most bitcoin users would be convinced by a signed ""Craig is Satoshi"" message, the Australian Tax Office may be more impressed by your authority than by cryptographic authority.

Well, ATO can ask the human experts they respect for their opinions of the cryptographic proof."
If you are concerned about it then why did you buy into bitcoin?
And Yoko
Hence why he had to reveal himself, I feel sorry for him.
What a strange question. If you're concerned about accidents why do you travel?
"Missing the point. Unless the cryptographic proof is performed in person in front of the expert, it doesn't prove that the individual is the one with access to the keys.

I think the ATO did ask for human experts to verify Craig's claim. Gavin, Andreas, and Jon were among the experts asked."

"How do you know the amount of money waiting on the sidelines for opportunities to get in?

It's not perfectly clear which coins are satoshi's. As they get further away from the genesis block it becomes even more difficult to be sure. If I was him trying to cash out I'd work backwards until someone became highly suspicious I was dumping before coming out. Then again, maybe he did just that.
It's understandable that people are unhappy with how Craig is going about this.  However it doesn't mean he's not Satoshi.  Some very smart people have apparently not grasped that simple fact.  Clearly there is some publicity stunt aspect to this that goes way beyond just signing some coins.  Either way time will bring out the truth.
Nope. While it might be true that those coins moving would push the price down, there's zero advantage to him coming out before they do. 
Ah, I guess I'd missed the detail that it was ATO asking people to do this verification, somehow I had in my head that it was CW asking for it.
"Except you are not required to be exposed to the risks of bitcoin (your analogy is incorrect, as travel is essential part of a human's life), so the question still stands:

"Ok, I'm not going to state the obvious of whats been going on for the last 24 hours... instead I'm going to ask ""Why don't you?""

Edit: Fine, I believe it is Satoshi because he fulfills a bunch of personal criteria (that I won't go into and probably won't make sense anyway). I have thought Craig was Satoshi since he revealed himself at the conference end of last year. Also because only Jon and Satoshi know of specific things that Satoshi asked Jon in the very early days, I only know of the vague content because Jon told me. I also believe in the character of Gavin (having known of him for years and chatted with him quite a few times). It would have to take some stupidly amazing con to be able to get Gavin and Jon to both put their reputations on the line.

Honestly, the attacks on Gavin (not so much on Jon for some reason) from both sides (Core/Classic) has been rather disheartening. I applaud the people asking for more evidence, if Bitcoin has taught us one thing, it is that of trust. But personally I had enough evidence months ago, this just solidifies it for me. Is the hatred from some corners really needed?

I've dealt with NDA's and secret backroom meetings and similar crap, I have a strong sense of what that can be like. I feel sorry for Gavin and Jon for being placed in this position, I feel sorry for them for the hatred and venom thrown at them just for respecting Craig's wishes of privacy and the ""please let me do the announcing"". It placed them in a shit position, I feel even more sorry for Craig that he had to do this in the first place.

I do wish things were just a steady one way track as they were years ago and the vitriol and hatred could be left outside the door as we all explored this wonderful technology together...

Andreas is right in a way that it doesn't matter who created it, he is amazingly right in many ways, he's also a key reason why the UK has its regulations the way they are (though he doesn't know it) and hence why Craig (assuming Satoshi) moved to London, thanks Andreas.

But since Blockstreamcore has used the 'appeal to authority' method so much over the last year, it seems that the only way to stop their destructive path is to take that away from them. I don't see Craig's 'outing' as a new 'appeal to authority', but rather a 'dont appeal to blockstreamcore authority, because it is wrong'.

I hope Craig can disappear back to silence and focus on what he loves doing, I hope Bitcoin can get back on one track and we can all start moving in the same direction again, I hope the hatred and enmity towards everyone in the space can be put aside (there is far too much), and I hope that everyone continues to develop and spread wonderful things.

Perhaps I hope too much.. but I still will and I will always work towards that."
Clearly because he's from the future 
Your opinion and all those points are entirely irrelevant.  Satoshi doesn't have to be who you wish or expect him to be.
Satoshi's coins moving unexpectedly would have tanked the price far harder than this Wright thing has, and likely before he could ever sell them.
The important questions.
"There is no way to know if a party is malicious or not. 

Go find your meds."
EXACTLY, so WHO asked Andreas to sign an NDA?
[deleted]
"Those sentiments should have been expressed to the people who got that NDA to you on it's way back (un-signed). Using your refusal to participate as a tool to punch holes is CW's assertions is what is commonly called ""below the belt"", and you should be ashamed of yourself."

blockstream is a scam
"To me declining this ""opportunity"" is simple common sense for any adult over the age of 25.

Never underestimate the ability of a con man to fool.  That should be learned by any reading of history such as the famous Victorians who were fooled by claims of ghosts or even pictures of tiny fairies."
"> Back to work.

It's a bit late in the evening, but maybe I should catch up on some lost work now ;)"
The real Satoshi doesn't need to appeal to authority because he's the biggest authority there is on bitcoin.
"Craig is a big fan of NDA's.  Big big fan.  He has approached people I know always waving an NDA ""in-hand"", as first order of business.  So maybe it was him.  Though this evidence I've just presented is fairly weak, as apparently Blockstream has the same rep with NDA's. "
"> Identifying the creator only serves to feed the appeal-to-authority crowd, as if SN is some kind of infallible prophet, or has any say over bitcoin's future.

this mechanism, fud, and censorship is used by other parties to control bitcoin development, so why not use it to bring bitcoin development in another direction?"
"Perhaps what Craig needs help with is convincing the authorities hounding him on tax issues that he is Satoshi.

While most bitcoin users would be convinced by a signed ""Craig is Satoshi"" message, the Australian Tax Office may be more impressed by your authority than by cryptographic authority.

As such, perhaps he was asking you for a favor.

He has also said that he doesn't want the recognition. That he's forced to provide a degree of identity confirmation. Perhaps he's hoping that by not leaving behind incontrovertible cryptographic public evidence it will be easier to regain some degree of obscurity.

You may be correct though, if that's his goal, that there will be a cost to your reputation for all those left unconvinced."
"Absolutely perfect! Did the blockchain stop after the ""revelation"" that Wright is Satoshi? Nope. The blockchain keeps plodding along and doesn't give a rat's ass who claims to have invented it... and that is probably its most salient advantage."
"> the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto does not matter

Satoshi has ~1 million unspent coins. That matters a bit."
If Bitcoin was political, I'd say this is a diversion tactic to direct attention aw... WAIT A MINUTE,...
">  If SN wants to ""prove"" their identity, they don't need an ""authority"" to do so. 

100% agree.

> and I don't want to know.

i think that you are somehow (without a real reason) afraid of SN being an authority, if SN plays no important role in todays development then why so reluctant to know the identitiy of him? development would go on as before just with the little difference that its nice to know who invented that thing.

but, like i said, the subtle hostility towards Wright from some devs screams fear all over the place imo."

"I agree with you to a point, but in the last almost 6 years since I've discovered Bitcoin, I've found that this community can rip people to shreds when they find something they don't like and it only takes a tiny bit of doubt for people to go on a crusade. 

Right now Bitcoin is an unfinished project, and so long as it is unfinished, it will be vulnerable to corruption, we've seen plenty of it in recent years and these special interests are dismantling a system whose roots were based on never needing a group or organisation to plan it's future operation, but that is what we have right now. *IF* Craig is Satoshi, he could set things straight so that Bitcoin can live up to what I dreamed it could be (yes, I believe in this case we NEED an appeal to authority as Bitcoin in an unfinnished state is vulnerable to corrupt groups), and the entrenched interests will find anything to discredit the real Satoshi if he ever came forward and had a viewpoint that clashed with them. The incumbents are devoid of moral integrity, and have the complete undivided attention of the miners. Having reputed people in the Bitcoin community independently verify his identity can freeze vitriolic ad hominem attacks in their tracks and makes it extremely hard to smear a person (although you can already see Theymos and the hate brigade are already hard at work).

That said, I wish he'd damn well hurry up and release some online proof so it's done, independent verification is great and all but it's pretty moot if everyone else can't be satisfied either.

Thanks for all the work you've done BTW :)."
Well, Bitcoin currently depends on ONE authority: Blockstream.
This is what I don't get, why would verifying identify require any kind of third party? Verifying ownership of private keys used in early SN messages or in early blocks should just be a matter of signing some messages and letting whoever wants to verify it do so.
the real satoshi would know how to prove who he is anyway
Andreas, thanks for your principled explanation.
Andreas, you have an absolutely wonderful mastery of language & real value. Thanks for making the right decision again & sharing about it with us.
Wouldn't it be a hoot if Adam Black was actually SN?  That would explain why BTCC, Slush and such are so friendly to AB.  It would also explain all the NDA's that block stream requests.  It would turn the bitcoin world upside down.  Drama^128.
Lol if he dumps all of his coins it will effect bitcoin...

"""I dont care, and i dont want to know"" Yes that's right Satoshi & Gavin with enough financial resources to develop Bitcoin for years to come sounds terrible. Much better having on the fence Andreas, theymos & blockstream.
