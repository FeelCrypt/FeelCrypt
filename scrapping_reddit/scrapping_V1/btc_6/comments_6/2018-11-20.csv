that's Vitalik for you.
Yes, and kings are the best form of government if you have a good king.
You can get it from partying with hookers too... 😀

Actually, the fact that there **are** public mod logs pretty much tells me everything I need to know.
"Jihan is way more based than Roger. And some people hate him even more precisely for that

A calm capitalist in our Silicon Valley technocratic utopia world? Burn the witch"
Did Jihan ever publicly support CSW?  Roger did and it was very obvious, but I was under the impression Jihan just kept quiet about it and never public confirmed nor denied. Or did I miss something?
Craig Wright. 
Vitalik by now I would think it's no longer a surprise that the average person can't quite keep up with you 😉
It was pretty clear when he first made his BS announcement. I don't know how any of this stuff ever came to fruition... Pretty sad honestly.
you really could say the same of roger
are you american by any chance?
Question for downvoters: what are u going to do about it? I'm genuinely interested. Totalitarian destruction of each open blockchain where CP is found (miners, nodes, code - burn all of it with the state's manpower)? Or volunatristic shaming of its users? What if shaming won't work?
Not sure if he works for them but yes. Roy Murphy i believe his name is.
and..... sigh
"PUT SOME MONEY ON HER

ON HER TABLE "
"Two parts: 

1. CSW had a **noticeable** boost by bought upvotes and paid shills, which helped shift public opinion and promote his content/brand

2. ""the enemy of my enemy is my friend"" - CSW, even while acknowledged as a fraud by informed people, was deemed still an ""useful idiot"" to further BCH agenda

It's hard to counter a malicious shilling campaign unless the community is clearly made aware of it."
"By ""good"" guys, we mean those that serve our interests. But there is not another person who knows exactly what I truly want for myself all the time than myself, I am the best ""good"" guy there is to be in charge."
"> Censorship is great if (implied: and only if) you can guarantee that the good guys are in charge

Good guys need to update arguments against bad ideas. So even if they're in charge, they should remind everyone (including themselves) why this or that idea are wrong from time to time instead of prohibiting its discussion. So, when is censorship great? Never. And since 2009 Bitcoin technologically secures it"
"I am quite interested in this line of reasoning. Who do you purport to be the ""good guys"" and how do you define good? I assume you are talking about politics here, since your original tweet was referring to censorship in the political space. I'd love to get your honest reply."
Ok. Well, I think there could exist some 100% benevolent and positive entities, in which case selective censorship might be helpful for everyone. That could be possible. However, since that is basically impossible to guarantee, it is too great of a weapon to hand over to someone who isn't 100% good, that it is best to practice no-censorship than risk that power falling into the wrong hands. Since there is no way to do that, abolish censorship. Makes sense to me. I certainly see your logic but I don't think invoking censorship is bad for its own sake, I think it is bad because of the possible harm from misuse, and thus, not good to have a system that can allow said misuse (assuming there is a non-0 chance of a bad actor having power, which he remarks is certainly not non-0!)
That's why it's philosophy.
"That is absolutely not what he's saying, what is your problem?

"
"The tweet was not in relation to Ethereum, so you are inferring a lot here. He has already clarified what he meant in that tweet above.

Let me put it simply:

**Traditional way to word it:** censorship is bad! 

**Another way to word it, which is equivalent:** censorship is only good if x holds true. But x doesn't hold true."
"Then why make the argument in the first place? Censorship is bad, even when the 'good guys' are in power. Because whichever faction I believe is ""good"", my politicial opposition believes is awful. And thus even if the good guys were in power they would completely shut down discussion from the other side, automatically making them the bad guys."
"And you understand that the ""good guys"" is always subjective in politics right? Use your brain."
And also an open admission that he is willing to employ censorship when he is in a position of power. Because he obviously would consider himself a good guy. Think about it.
Yourself. For your own kingdom
"Yeah what about that link you shared that links to a true and intelligent observation from Vitalik? 

PS. Please don't argue with me over whether Trump is good or bad until all relevant investigations have been concluded.

"
Mod logs are open
Not preferred, good. There aren't that many words there, you might as well read them all
That isn’t even the point. It was just a figurative situation to explain why censorship is never good.
"Benevolent dictator all day.

If only such a person existed."
"heh, fair answer, if i'd asked ""who'd you think **owns** this sub?""

in some cases own != control

for example, Slack **owns** Slack, but individual people **control** their own slacks

but hey... let's not pander about correct terminology and try to spin it instead shall we? ;)

obviously some concepts are just beyond the understanding of some people and we can fool them by twisting words & meanings around for the stupid people amirite? ;)"
">Did Jihan ever publicly support CSW?  Roger did and it was very obvious

Roger probably had some Jesus-deals in the mix with Craig in the early days. Then Craig likely backstabbed him and went full retard. Roger didn't want to cut Craig loose until the time was right, it's business etiquette (of which Craig has precisely -10^(5)). 

Now the gloves are off, and Craig is squirming. "
Jihan is a man of few words. 
"Arguing for the greatness of censorship as long as ""my guy"" has power is a losing proposition."
"He is talking about politics, so no it's not ""obviously true"". He believes censorship is good and moral as long as his preferred authority is in power. Highly dangerous argument to make."
Don't you see that he's not advocating for censorship because of that reason? His point is there's no guarantee 'your guy' will be in power. You really missed the part of his tweet that implies there is no way to guarantee good guys are in power. 
vitalik is a philosopher. That statement makes the assumption that you know good guys are in charge, some type of mathematical proof not possible in reality. It's just philosophy and obviously true. Provably bad actors are censored all the time when their transactions are rejected by protocol
He's been nothing but hospitable toward Ver. Even congratulated him for both forks (the recent one and the one last year).
When did he become so good at burns?
"I was about to type the exact same thing; I even had the same number of E's and S's as you! Then I scrolled down and.... sigh"
Even Vitalik knows Craig Wright is a cancer to the entire crypto space. Most hated guy just now. Man I hope he gets whats coming for him. 
Wth was that 😂
I seriously enjoy watching him do things. /r/vitalikdoingthings should be a thing
I agree with what he said
Everybody on the fork livestream was ecstatic to see Vitalik, who dropped in to congratulate ABC and teabag Craig in a friendly way.
"Indeed Comrade. I know that those guys in SV are taking the piss with their NPC meme about 'Aussie Man Bad' but they are right he is an absolute dick.

&#x200B;

That said, he has been proven right about some things, like Turing Completeness and these recent SEC crackdown..but aside from that, he is like the worst example of the Proletariat.

&#x200B;

Together we are strong. "
What about when CSW showed up with a questionable reputation and no proof claiming to be Satoshi? People should have paid attention to that circus. 
Soon
Smart guy
why is everyone hating on wright? Reading through his twitter.. he seems 10x more educated than this Ver moron who was spouting complete bullshit this same exact time last year.. it's funny how quickly all you crypto pumpers change tunes. 
Oh man he stole my idea.  Except I wanted to call it Bitcoin Cash Classic
Vitalik obviously prefers a cheap competitor of Ethereum that then can easily overtake as opposed to sound money.
Interestingly enough some BCC folks are working now for nChain to promote BSV.
"1 thing i don't like him was what he did about the dao

Although the market didn't care lol"
"  
Well, one major reason I think btcash community are dumb is that they even believe such a blatant con artist CW. "
Seeing Vitalik dunk on CSW is a sight for sore eyes at any time. 
Vitalik might also be right about PoS.
As a original BCH supporter, I will never approve CSW's way of rebuilding the BCH. There might be some good features that could actually make BCH getting better, CSW? He will never be that kind of guy on the stage. As he convinced other, he will be remembered, as the psychopath. 
"Censorship is great if (implied: and only if) you can guarantee that the good guys are in charge. In reality, you cannot guarantee that the good guys are in charge. Hence, censorship is not great.

It surprises me how many people failed to understand what I was actually saying there."
"To say that there are 0 situations in which censorship might be helpful and to also say that there is a 0% chance of a perfectly benevolent entity is false IMO. It might be infinitesimally small, but it is not 0. 

Also, yes he is saying that it could be good if in the right hands but that is impossible to guarantee, thus it is ALWAYS bad! He's against it. You guys agree with each other.

...And I'm done here."
Is that actually true? Bitconnect people working for nChain?
Vitalik is super smart. Sometimes I think he looks ill, like he has a certain auto-immune disease. I doubt he has though, unless he did Heroin.  
I opposed him but welcomed him to the community just because of his sheer monetary presence. But overall I expected him to just shut up and enjoy the ride others would lead.\*You ever seen that movie scene where the teacher is asking a question and there's one member of the audience wanting to answer and the teacher does his best to avoid him, well that's CSW. Except in this scene he got up walked up in front of the class and tried to commandeer the lecture.\*
"> I think there could exist some 100% benevolent and positive entities, in which case selective censorship might be helpful for everyone.

This is the fundamental error in your reasoning. Politics is a space with thousands of different philosophies and orientations, as well as many different solutions to extremely varied and highly complex problems. Talking about ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"" is a completely reductionist and dangerous way of thinking about governance. It's an iterative process often times with many different equally valid answers to problems, and as such, granting the power of censorship to any entity is not only dangerous, it is also wrong.

What Vitalik is saying is that as long as HE or HIS political faction is in power (I assume he considers himself one of the 'good guys'), he percieves censorship to be great and moral. It is the reasoning of an authoritarian."
Some people presume that r/btc supported CSW prior to the fork. But how can that be? He's done nothing before SV split, and after the split he's involuntary feeding us some information about their inner kitchen on SV side. I doubt he personally wrote anything in SV 0.1. Maybe he wrote a stack of generic buzzword patents, but it's pretty irrelevant
The majority of users are NOT on social media. 
"Great dancer too

That's a great point. I think it also speaks to the crypto sphere at large. With so many cryptocurrencies existing and new ones emerging all the time, who really knows which are good or bad, useful or not useful, innovative or not? It would make sense that very few people can really understand what is actually going on at this point.

"Who is CSW?

Sorry,I've  been out of the loop due to real life stuff 

Edit: removed ""as"""
Uh, no. There were plenty also calling out CSW pretty much immediately. It might be understandable that it took some a while to catch on but it's surprising the people who still seem to be in his thrall.
Wasn't everyone and their mothers already convinced that he was a fraud like.. years ago?
Risk. Finance
He is a con artist and a lier. There exist big lists of things he have been caught lying about
U're underestimating changes that Bitcoin will bring. No one will be able to erase data that some psycho will decide is valuable. Mankind has to concur with this incoming reality now, before it's too late. Like public executions of CP producers or something
is this Craig Wright?
Ironically I think he was ahead of the curve based on his understanding of people. He’s a smart guy about people as well as tech.
