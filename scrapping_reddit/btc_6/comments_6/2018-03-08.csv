If you think such flagging/reporting being automated does not incentivize such teams, even cater to them, you are mistaken.

I wonder what ""youtube guidelines"" were violated."
"Its very daunting isn't it?  Its tough when you are trying to point out the misdeeds of others, then get accused of behaving poorly yourself and face negative consequences.

I liked that video.  It was clear and persuasive.  I think you should make another attempt at the same subject but be more careful in your wording so that it is clear you are not trying to deceive.  I would think twice about doing that only if you have no more information about where exactly the line is that you crossed.  That way your channel isn't put in jeopardy.

Stay strong and good luck if you appeal."
"I don't think conservatives are being silenced at all.  If there were I think that would be excellent.  Conservatives are always wrong on every topic and should be rejected immediately.

The ""deep state"" is conservative.  drumpfy didn't open any door, except for swamp creatures like himself.  You are deluded.

Its not censorship as Ver can upload the video elsewhere without punishment.  I friggin love social justice.  It brings so much liberty and freedom.  You run along now."
Youtubes just terrible in general. . 
"Wow, that's ridiculous.

It must have been a series of reports."
It is very clearly fair use, and Youtube specifically said the video was taken down for violating rules against [spam and deceptive practices](https://i.imgur.com/T5irv3x.png)

Yep.
Yeah agreed, luckily Trump overcame this and still won. CTR ring a bell? 
"Besides trying to get rid of the alternative voices as well as the ""conservatives"", it is also about testing to see what they can get away with AND getting people to self censor in fear of losing their accounts."
How exactly? Genuinely curious. How can a blockchain store large numbers of high-definition video (aka DTube)?
"Those behind this don't care.  Their objective is the short term objective is to stem the tide for the mid-term elections.  If they can get enough seats changed they can try for ""trumped"" up impeachment."
How it d.tube better? ELI5 please.
That’s because you think all these bots represent a majority of people 
Well, it said it was tagged and after review they decided to remove it. 
Google took sides when they automated video take downs, which disregards meaning and ethics in favor of whoever is the most outspoken.  Hence we have censorship by the most threatened parasites.
"Their system is essentially ""tyranny of the majority / Sybil attackers until proven otherwise."" Doesn't seem like a very good long term plan for a content platform."
Got the links thanks :)
Top shelf /r/btc critical thinking right here.
Here, you dropped [this](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71GV79NPpZL._UL1500_.jpg).
"It seems clear that taking my video down for ""[spam and deceptive practices](https://i.imgur.com/T5irv3x.png)"" is BS."
"Does not matter.  Everyone is getting dinged.  There's a move by the ""deep state"", to silence conservatives and others who are not part of the MSM.  RV does not know WHY, and this indicates that something is fucked up.  It means that every video he makes from here on out he has to double think what he says and how he says it.  It's an insidious predicament that is best solved by moving to another platform.

These people are closing the door used by Trump so that others cannot do what Trump did, especially since mid term elections are just around the corner.  Censorship on major social media sites is becoming common because of this move to control the narrative.  The best thing to do is circle around and find another open door that the control freaks have not thought of.

Google has been infected with SJW types and is being sacrificed in order to serve the twisted agenda behind these people.  I've even considered purchasing long term put options against Google, because it's going to suffer a serious brain drain and loss of good personnel."

Nope.  Youtube specifically said the video was taken down for violating rules against [spam and deceptive practices](https://i.imgur.com/T5irv3x.png)
If that was the reason, it would be clearly stated in the takedown notice and on the page of the video itself.

Then turn your TV back on.  You're missing your favorite sitcom.
Lol... paranoia much? There is ennemies within the crypto community. It was a core brigade move on YouTube that s all. If what ever secret society you have in mind cared about what Roger said, the video would have been dumped from facebook as well and Roger would probably be dead by now. 
Man, that's BS on youtube part. What spam? What deceptive practices? Total bull.
"You may be correct, idk. All I know they are blocking, frustrating, obstructing literally everything that has anything to do with r/cbts_stream, or is some way a threat to the establisment like BCH. 
  
Latest Twitter means of censorship. When I tried to read a tweet of Sebastian Gorka. https://imgur.com/km95BMU. This is multinational corps deciding for you what information you should consume. How can we make decent decisions as civilians when certain relevant information, we agree or disagree on, is withheld from us? This is a fundamental democratic problem. "

"That sounds like fucking commie talk!!!  

As long as you aren't shilling commie or terrorist garbage you should be able to post whatever you want!  It says so in the constitution!!"
So then they will just create new accounts...
Not really, way more damage is done to the people being reported.
The last 2 years have proven that the internet and social media are mainly run by bots and trollfarms, and that it's effective enough to influence presidential elections.
With how much content gets wrongly flagged it doesn’t seem like it. If nothing on this vid violates anything, it should be back up within a few days.
Blockchain will fix this
Nope. They can even use DMCA takedowns if it's not a copyright issue and youtube doesn't care.
nah, thats the thing.  They want to make you think that a human is behind it, but at most a worker in India spends 5 seconds looking at it ... most likely its just an automated system because there is no other reason his video would be removed by any thinking employee of Youtube.
"The video storage is decentralized on bitchute but the database that effectively indexes them is not. I've seen their forums and the best they have is a ""commitment"" to not censoring, which isn't really any better than Youtube or Twitter in the early days which were also anti-censorship until they got bigger."
Stephen Crowder
We are in a propaganda information war. We both know who youtube is ultimately controlled by and who they ultimately serve... Roger, it might be a good idea to start funding or working on creating major viable alternatives to facebook, youtube, google, twitter, etc. All of these platforms are controlled by the Enemy and will ultimately become very heavily censored and used against us. This is something I would be really happy to be involved with.
"Gee wiz! Roger Ver ripped off other people’s work and used it to deceive others???   I am so shocked!! Like who could have ever imagined such a paragon of virtue would be so unjustly called out for his actions?   

Clearly the current site calling itself YouTube doesn’t follow the original vision of the creators of YouTube.   Perhaps Roger should create a website for video sharing and call it Youtube-Watch?

Clearly it would then be the real YouTube.  But fuck anyone who dares refer to it as Ywatch because it would be the only true YouTube right!  Then he can set up other social media accounts under the YouTube name and that would be totally cool right??? Right???

P.s. bcash !  "
"Given the fact that you are marketing your coin as Bitcoin when it's not, and everyone else besides this community knows it's not *and* calls it by a variety of different names to differentiate it from Bitcoin just so there's no confusion...

I'd say you're definitely using spam and deceptive tactics.

Give this a shot:

1: Call Bitcoin Cash what it is: Bitcoin Cash, and make it clear that it's not Bitcoin *(because you know it's not)*.

2: Stop flooding our subreddit with bitcoin.com articles from brand new accounts *(because you know it's spam)*."
If you don't think there are teams going around flagging/reporting stuff they don't like, you are mistaken. They openly admitted to doing that to the @bitcoin twitter account
"> Roger Ver ripped off other people’s work and used it to deceive others???

What on earth are you talking about?"
"To be fair, most cryptos, including bitcoin, operate on basically a ""tyranny of the majority"" principle."
Youtube-Cash but then later fight to call it Youtube because of true vision...
How so?
"Yes, but the trend takes time, and the mid-term elections are probably the targets, with the objective of getting just enough compromised representatives in office so as to attempt to remove Trump.

NOTE: I don't know if Trump is a good thing or bad, but I don't like how these power plays are fucking with the internet and removing voices that need to exist as a balance for reason."
"That's true up to a point, but youtube has created the expecation of non-censorship, but has now changed this.  Those that have contributed to and built on and for the platform are now being censored.  The time spent has destroyed the trust and could possibly result in lawsuits for breach of contract (implied).

It is very similar to what Theymos did.  The expectation (implied contract) was one of non-censorship, but instead turned into a system of control.  

To claim that this is fair game ignores the fact that if the rules (implied contract) indicates that they were not going to be politically bias.  If youtube and theymos indicated up front that the the TOS will be used to remove content of a political nature, and people still posted and got content removed, then, yes that would be fair game.

If we are to apply ""fair game"" to all web sites, then over time social media sites will continually be bought out and subverted because the TOS and implied contracts mean nothing.  There's nothing to stop deep pockets from buying out or threatening/subverting key individuals and then having the content they don't like removed.  Either the TOS and implied contracts have force, or the internet is fucked."
Ah... that makes sense as well. And thank you so much! I know what to look up now. IPFS and RINA both sound insanely interesting and promising for the future of free speech, as it appears youtube is quickly going to monetize nothing but “dog vs. whipped cream” and the new Miley Cyrus videos.
...and the actual videos are stored on chain??

Does it implement crypto-currencies at all?
the influence was positively in trumps favourite not negatively
Trump is really irrelevant (in this context). Whichever way you slice it and whoever benefited, there was definitely non-grassroots manipulation of the internet during the last cycle and it's only going to get worse (not just for politics). Everyone interested in free, balanced expression should come together and see if we can work together to find a way to lessen the voices of these influences, preferably in a way that doesn't result in echo chambers (though if you want that, that's fine). You hate Hillary? Fine. You hate Trump? Fine too. let's find a way to make your voice mean something. (Personally, I think in a decent system, we wouldn't have seen either of them even run).
YouTube has always censored content. They are just censoring more now due to financial threat pressure.
"Yes but the size of the fork limits the ""tyrants"" effectiveness. Since joining an usound fork is stupidity."

"It's in the very beginning of the [video](https://www.facebook.com/rogerkver/videos/10155329191965737/). He says Bitcoin being able to scale was used to be clear and the information was available in Bitcoin.orgs ""own wiki page"". Which after checking, appears to be fully accurate."
I believe it runs on their own LBRY token which is used to tip or pay content creators.
There sure were a ton of shills here on reddit just in the primary trying to destroy Bernie. Really early, before Trump had really even started to pick up steam. Why would he invest a ton in shaping the opposition before it was clear he was going into the general election?
You sure about that? I recall trump being smeared the whole election and the meida biased towards H was as if she was a shoein. America felt differently than the MSM. 
Ah so trump hired CTR to troll online forums and “correct the record” then? For some reason I thought that was Clinton’s doing... /sarcasm 
Which is more accurately stated as, market selection for sound money.
Interesting. I'll have to see if there's a compare-and-contrast of these out there somewhere.
trump lost the popular vote... 
I guess those trump rallies were just a bunch of bots and trollfarms attending. Lol Dems still salty their illegal voters didn't throw them over top in 2016. Hillary didn't even win the Dem primary legitimately, but they all cowed behind anyhow.
Not me. They fucked Bernie, so I said fuck the Democratic Party.
Well there's the decentralized streaming service LBRY the crypto community should promote it more
If you have a better alternative you'll become a billionaire real quick. Properly moderating the largest video repository on the planet sounds like a monster of a task and I genuinely have no idea how to do it better than how Google does it without a moderation team of absolutely monstrous size.

Companies make the complaint, YouTube complies. That isn’t changing, because the service isn’t free. Someone is paying for it if you aren’t."

Yes, but the point I'm making is that without showing the link from Bitcoin.org to the old Bitcoin Wiki he is not in any way helping to back up the actual claim he makes in the video. Had he done that, the example would have been more obviously accurate.

WTF 1ST AMENDMENT MUCH?!
Youtube flagging/removal process is mostly automated.  So, all it takes is a lot of people to report a video for them to take it down, they think something must be wrong because so many people reported it, then it goes down.  If you appeal it, then it may goto a human.
Repost it on https://d.tube. Can't ever be removed there.
There's literally no information there about what community guideline you supposedly violated.
My nine-year-old and his friends can teach his 85-year-old grandmother how to do this to any video. Hang in their Roger, and maybe you should post on the other platforms as well. Youtube is going the way of MySpace.

You Tube is engaging in a purge of content that does not conform to their ideological preferences.

put it on Steemit please.   Then it cam never be taken down.  blockchain is our answer to these attacks
Wow, being censored by youtube for exposing the censorship on r/bitcoin.  Unreal...  guess your not allowed to have an opinion on youtube.
At this stage, it is quite clear there is likely to be a concerted organised campaign to deny BCH a platform.  I wonder how we can get Facebook to investigate this.  It would be easy for them to look at which accounts have reported the video.  
Was the clip in the middle of the tv show not copyrighted? I think that must be the reason.
Are these guys (core supporters) for real? Holy crap they must be desperate.
"Roger unfortunately you tripped and fell in this video. Probably got too passionate with too little rest in-between going rounds against the enemy. 

1. You said it was right there ""on Bitcoin.org"", but then show a picture of Bitcoin Wiki. (If the wiki was linked from Bitcoin.org, then you should have inlcuded evidence of that as well) Edit: It is indeed still linked, from the FAQ page.

2. You claimed that all sort of _new_ people came in and enacted censorship (selectively political, manipulative and unfair moderation would have been my own choice of words), but since you then show and mention r/Bitcoin and BitcoinTalk this will be taken as a claim that the owner of these social media channels (which obviously would at least appear to still be the same early developer known as theymos) was one of these ""new"" people.

Other than this though you were spot on. So I'm still sad to see the video go. But perhaps it was for the better, because now you can submit an improved version at some point."
Them Tube. 
You mean the effects of censorship and propaganda on roger ver.

Maybe it was reported heavily by r/Bitcoin. They have history of doing such things. They mass reported the Bitcoin wallet by Bitcoin.com.

"The major social media sites are turning into major cluster fucks.  Reddit is still viable as a whole, but censorship still eats away at parts of it.

BitChute.com is a much better place for videos these days.  Avoid anything Google related as it is akin to building your house on sand.  The same goes for Facebook and twitter.  Find alternatives and build on those."

a) Core shills/Blockstream took it down

b) Google censored it because it talks about censorship and their agenda (they have been trying to remove conspiracy theorists and information about the Florida shooting. They even did that for the Las Vegas shootings. I think they are doing this to get majority anti-guns, get everyone to give up guns and the government will control the lives of its citizens.)

"
Sounds like you tube should adopt a blockchain tech to rate people who flag videos as the system is automated they should lose the ability to flag stuff if the content does not violate the terms and conditions. 
We really need Reddit, YouTube, and Twitter alternatives to start.
Apart from reddit where is the censorship and propaganda for BTC? I can’t really see it anywhere else or heard about it anywhere else?
Can you edit and re-upload the video with a link to the original video you embedded as a reference? Youtube probably just took a dislike to reuse of someone else's footage.
It seems like most platforms and websites like YouTube, Twitter and Reddit are censored, and this makes me appreciate Bitcoin even more knowing that it is un-censorable.
Google isn't exactly.. unbiased. 
"What is wrong showing a psychological experiment explaining how foolish people act by questioning nothing but simply comply!?
  
@MemoryDealers. You know what's going on in the world/the US in particular and the stance Reddit, Google, YouTube, Twitter etc. take. These are not the entities we should support as long as the internet bill of rights is not active. May I suggest https://www.bitchute.com/ ? "
Oh for fuck's sake... are you serious? It's not censorship, it's Youtube's standard reaction to copyright violation. Roger Ver included someone else's video in his own, and Youtube removed it. It's not even a human-initiated process, it's just copyright violation robot doing its job. Is this really the kind of thing this subreddit deems worthy of upvoting?
Why?
"This was such a great video. I even commented something like ""I would have never stood up but instead laughed at them all"""
how ironic...
Where is a decentalized YouTube.... Even steemit is a piece of censored crap.
Dump the video on d.tube
oh the irony!
Yet you still allow users to be banned left and right by bitcoinxio, in this very sub. Why was /u/hoaxchain banned again? 
"Thanks for sharing this Roger. It appears that core supporters repeatedly flagged this video for youtube review and youtube decided to take it down. 

This is beyond absurd. Reddit allowed the stifling of dissent on r/bitcoin by letting theymos and bashco to censor all opposing opinion. 

Now google is following on the same lines and siding with core. I'm not surprised since the globalists that funded blockstream also control big tech companies and they don't want BCH to disturb the establishment structure that they benefit from. "
You realize Roger Ver is based in Japan, and (I could be wrong), renounced american citizenship. That being the case, regardless of platform, the 1st amendment doesn't apply to him.
I think that clip was from a tv show so it was copyrighted.
Looking at your post history. Are you for real ? Your purpose for this reddit account is hating on BCH. No other content. Hope you get paid 
To be honest, there is no reason given in that copy of the notice except for violating community guidelines. Looking at the video he actually ripped someone else's content and put the entire video in his video. YouTube doesn't care about Core vs Cash. They do care about you ripping someone else's content.
"It wasn't removed for copyright,  it was [removed for](https://i.imgur.com/T5irv3x.png) violating Youtube's policy regarding ""spam and deceptive practices"" "
"d.tube may not be perfectly decentralized, but I think it's good enough.

It's still a website (just like steemit.com) so of course it must obey by the laws of whatever jurisdiction it's under, but the videos themselves (on ipfs) is very hard to censor, and the meta information is available through a blockchain.

With only hundred witnesses (isn't it?) it's not completely impossible to subdue all the witnesses and censor content, but ... that should be pretty hard, I guess.

Of course, visibility is quite much influenced by the people holding most steem power."
bitchute serves content via bittorrent which runs pretty seamlessly in the background. Their new user interface is really slick too. Hope a lot of casual video uploaders move over there.
"It is called ""Fair Use"" and this video clearly falls well within the fair use guidelines.
Besides that,  it was taken down for violating rules against ""[spam and deceptive practices](https://i.imgur.com/T5irv3x.png)"", not for anything copyright related.
"
"> Why was /u/hoaxchain

Since you repeat this so much, why do not you say the reason why they banned him and present your evidence?"
"""I don't believe in conspiracy theories except the ones rBitcoin tells me to believe. Roger is a shill and a liar. BCH supporters have been spamming the BTC blockchain for 3 years. BCH was created by miners so they could keep using ASICBOOST ~~which is evil~~. Oh wait now we like ASICBOOST. Oceania has always been at war with Eurasia. 2+2=5."" "
We appreciate you giving us your view from down there.
"PSA: u/T4GG4RT has been hounding this subreddit with accusations of improper banning against BitcoinXio for *months*. It all dates back to when BitcoinXio (rightfully) banned a highly harrassive and toxic user that was making personal threats. /u/hoaxchain was banned for violating Reddit's sitewide rules about harassment, and this discussion has been held multiple times. I am posting this information here for the benefit of the casual reader that is wondering, ""What the hell is this u/T4GG4RT stuck on again?"", and doesn't want to search through six months of public moderation logs."
Doesn't apply to content provided on platforms of private organizations.
You have un-attibributed copyrighted footage in your video, surprised it's still up on FB. Videos, unlike FOSS, can not be simply copied, pasted, and published. There are certain rules one must follow.
Do those who report lose credibility if they are improperly flagging?
"> Youtube flagging/removal process is mostly automated. So, all it takes is a lot of people to report a video for them to take it down, 

That's not what the email said though. The email said that they had reviewed the video and ""determined that it violat[ed] [their] guidelines""."
And that´s a good procedure so far. Youtube will take it back soon I guess.
or bitchute.com
"> (If the wiki was linked from Bitcoin.org, then you should have inlcuded evidence of that as well)

Bitcoin.org has a whole forum section dedicated to the wiki. But it isn't actively maintained anymore AFAIK."
Completely false. Many of the biggest youtubers literally revolve their channel around using other people's youtube clips to comment on.
Reminds me of something...
Youtube specifically said the video was taken down for violating rules against [spam and deceptive practices](https://i.imgur.com/T5irv3x.png)
This. No proof is required apparently.
"Probably ""fair use""? I'm not an expert."
"yeah. This is also seen in other areas (alternative media for example). Peoples monetization revenue just drops substantially because channels are being flagged ""inapproproate for advertisers"". While not outright censorship, this *does* have huge effect.

It's sad that all it takes is a few trolls to get content removed from YouTube and other social media sites. They can get away with it because of the asymmetry of effort needed to produce content and fight bogus takedowns versus the amount of effort needed to spam the report link.

Yep, Google has an interest in keeping people in the dark about censorship and information control because it is one of the biggest practitioners of those same techniques.

Yes.  Reward those you enhance the site and remove reward for those who abuse.

[Here's an example opinion of a german lawyer](https://www.ferner-alsdorf.de/verwaltungsrecht/steuerrecht__muss-man-gewinne-aus-bitcoin-verkaeufen-versteuern__rechtsanwalt-alsdorf__10015/) who has looked deeply into the question what Bitcoin ""is"" from a jurisdictional perspective:

Relevant passage:

> Ich vertrete weiterhin den Standpunkt, dass es sich bei Bitcoins nicht um Geld im rechtlichen Sinne, sondern schlicht um Waren handelt (im Detail dazu hier). Vor diesem Hintergrund erkenne ich unter Umständen für Einnahmen eine Steuerpflicht auch für Privatpersonen: Voraussetzung ist aber, dass zwischen An- und Verkauf weniger als 1 Jahr liegt. Hintergrund ist, dass es sich bei Bitcoins nach aktueller Einschätzung wohl um „sonstige Wirtschaftsgüter“ i.S.d. §23 I Nr.2 EStG handeln wird. Einnahmen aus Veräußerung sind als sonstiges Einkommen zu versteuern (§22 Nr.2 EStG), wenn „der Zeitraum zwischen Anschaffung und Veräußerung nicht mehr als ein Jahr beträgt“.

Will do! 
Bitcoin Cash didn't even exist when I got banned. Banned simply for agreeing with the idea that Bitcoin's blocksize should be increased.
Goddamn you're in denial. Ever used removeddit.com? Try viewing some threads in r/bitcoin from about a year ago, replace reddit with removeddit and see what you find. We didn't get banned for promoting bitcoin cash, bitcoin cash and r/btc only became a thing AFTER and BECAUSE Theymos used censorship to stifle discussion about increasing the blocksize. I was a bitcoin maximalist.
"So I guess my question is, is that the kind of state of governance you want to live in, where a neighbor can kill you over a grievance?

How about governance of the roads? Should you be able to drive on whatever side you want and at whatever speed you so desire?

It's all about incentives. Incentive to properly dispose of motor oil means I, personally, don't face fines, and society benefits because I'm not being an idiot and destroying something that has value to everyone. Same for the rules of the road.

Also, expand upon your NASA example because that makes no sense to me. They made the decision to go the private route after the shuttle turned into a dud and are using Russia until the private sector has caught up to the needs, which it has, just needs certs to fly with a crew. That doesn't at all fly with the idea of ""regulations really screw things up""."

Tons of wrongly banned users. /u/hoaxchain is one well-known example. How many examples of censorship do you need? It's a matter of principle not degree. 
This guys is a known troll.  Take a look at his posts and you’ll notice how his day revolves around doing anything he can to vandalize BCH.  He is a popular troll.

It seems pretty obvious to me that lightning network with small blocks will centralize the network into the hands of several well-connected lightning payment processors (banks), I don't really understand how anybody could not see this. ""Bitcoin"" payments through LN will be efficient, but every transaction will be subject to KYC and AML through the permissioned consortium."
It is interesting that they have gone back to the Wikipedia vandalism. That used to be Greg Maxwell's bread and butter. Interesting that now that he has been fired from blockstream that it has become a problem again...

Just to be clear, they set all this up PRIOR to the fork. They already had a game plan of how to create FUD and confusion around the naming of Bitcoin Cash. "
Some of them are really weird. I went to the Wikipedia page for some lesser-known film and someone had messed with it by changing the names of the characters and other minor details. (It was the correct film and not a different version or the book version or anything). Quite odd.
