"The first sentance of Android's [wikipedia article] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)(emphasis mine):
>Android is a mobile operating system developed by Google, **based on a modified version** of the Linux kernel and other open source software and designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. "
"So you're saying nobody needs the newest hardware? I kind of take it as read that some people do but I'm open to being convinced otherwise.

Open source projects are great but they benefit from funding. If Ubuntuphone can secure funding through selling phones with it pre-installed, that means it is more likely to achieve success which can only be for the better. If I buy a Nexus phone and throw it on there, they don't benefit unless I go out of my way to make a donation. Plus the tie-in with newer hardware means more people are likely to be interested and also means they're more likely to be able to have some say in the parts of the phone that might not be available on hardware that was originally provisioned with a different OS."

"If you need it for privacy, you dont need the newest hardware. 

There are a few OSes you can try on Asus Zenphone
"
"I knew that, But we dont call it Linux phone now do we? Genius

Just as we dont call OSX, Unix  genius

Such a genius you are.

Yeah, put that way, you're right.

Most components from Salifish OS are proprietary (see https://sailfishos.org/about/) + drivers and firmware are proprietary too. So you have no clue what they put in. You're better off installing LineageOS, AOSP or paranoid android (has an official release) on an Xperia X since only the drivers and firmware are proprietary but the OS if completely free/libre and open-source.
Even better, Android is SELinux, developed by NSA. That's a good thing, everyone hates NSA so it must be million times better reviewed than Linux.
The worst thing about Android these days is that Google got fed up with having a relatively open platform and started pushing functionality into the Play services so if you don't have one of their licensed phones, you lose out on a lot of apps (side-loading the Play stuff sometimes works but I've had mixed luck with that).
"while that is true, but the first defense is to be free of Google which is known to track you and collect private data. 

No one suggest a custom made phone here buddy.
"
Is there no way to get ass deep into the programming and change this? What about fucking with the chip and it’s communications on the board, physically?
This right here. Also there are invisible inks that can be placed overtop CPU's that can pass inspection tests, but which make circuit connections allowing for backdoors or shorting out RNG's into a 'smaller box'. Open source hardware is needed.
"Reality is newest hardware will come with issues, both security and compatibility. Even if the whole package is controlled end to end. 

No point repeating this again, believe what you want. 
"
Examples that are known to do that : Intel IME and AMD PSP
Librem
"Meizu Ubuntu Phone?
Meizu MX4 and PRO 5 can run Ubuntu phone "

"That is exactly my point. To be free of Google ecosystem

Its funny how idiots still think by saying Linux phone i dont know Android is built on Linux. IF you dont understand why it's called Android and not generic Linux, you need to do a research. 


"
A backdoor is a backdoor. If another group obtains the procedure to unlock it, it does not matter who made it.
Just like Intel ME on desktop PCs.
Android is not *really* linux. It's more like a fork of linux.
"Why the heck you think i dont think everyone needs a phone designed for privacy. 

I said ""if you need it for privacy, you dont need the newest hardware""

Reality is the newest hardware comes with security risk. You need time to find vulnerability.Same with software. 

 As for open source project, it's opposite of what you say. Older hardware are fully tested and supported the best. I've use Linux and variant UNIX OS for a long time. Newest hardware always come with compatibility headache. It's good for test beds but if you want to use it for production ( hence privacy), i hope you got low blood pressure. 

"
"Same with OSX, no one called it UNIX OS, just because it use UNIX kernel. 

BSD is also UNIX kernel...

Conclusion, ignore the armchair softeng wannabe
"
"Replace Android or not is still a rumor. 

Google Fuchsia is Google's answer to QNX. Ultimately the goal is for automous driving and AI appliance. 

I expect Android to stay for atleast 5 years. Google would not risk their ecosystem. 

"
Interesting. That's pretty awful.
Nope, you're right. The proprietary blob of firmware code runs on a small ARM core which is isolated from what we usually think of being the OS. It is undocumented and is responsible for initializing the boot sequence for the system and the radio stack. Then it goes invisible. Some research says that it can peer into what is in memory and what the user OS is doing, and that it can respond to instructions it receives over the radio, but the user OS can't see into it at all. As such, there's no smoking gun at which we can conclusively prove that it can be used for spying, but it's being handled so secretively that it can't be dismissed as conspiracy theory either. The closest we have to evidence is that Huawei said the US Government asked them to install a backdoor, but they refused, and then the US Government said that Huawei was installing backdoors for the Chinese Government. I suppose I tend to agree with Kim Dotcom on this one. China is less of an immediate threat unless you're Chinese or living in a country which is a close ally. Just assume that your device is already compromised.

I'm sure it will be released, the question is just how horrible the software experience is going to be at release. 
I hate to say this, but, to date, you are more right than wrong
Do you have any source on that? As far as I knew, Android was running on a Linux kernel.
When I tried that it was a lot more time consuming than I had thought. I prefer OS which comes with the phone...
I wont buy any phone that doesn't have an official Lineage OS build.
You seem to harbor an awful lot of irrational hate. Ever thought of seeing a therapist to work this out?
"I'm not quite at that stage yet but I would like to dip my toes in the water.

One of the major problems with installing on older hardware is that it doesn't seem to be really supporting the project that well. I'd like to me able to buy something new and moderately powered at a reasonable price where a portion goes to encourage further development of the OS. I'm hoping they get that sorted (I was looking in the direction of Ubuntuphone or whatever it's called these days).

I do think that you're thinking the wrong way though. Everybody needs a phone designed for privacy, it just hasn't really sunk in yet."
"If I can just interject for a minute: Android should more properly be called Android/LInux. The reason is that the Linux kernel would not be very useful without the Android userland.
"
Don't think so. Of course they will include an Android runtime so all apps will continue to work.
"Not only that but their next os named fuchsia is not Linux based anymore and probably will be closed source like ios

What this means is google might be getting ready to dump android and chrome os too since fuchsia will be for all devices"
Correct me if I'm wrong, but as I recall the co-processors are actually used to initialize the main processor. That being said there are some documented methods of disabling the IME but YMMV.
Any links?
Op will deliver!
It uses the Linux kernel. But you can't really compare it to desktop distributions which are based on GNU and also use the Linux kernel. Apart from the kernel it's a whole different operating system.
"I'm under impression that those Sailfish components are just the UI. I could be wrong tho as I haven't looked very close. 

I can confirm that underlying stuff is pretty much same as here: https://git.merproject.org/mer-core
Which is basically just a Linux distro for mobile devices, with the usual open source userspace daemons and stuff.

Device drivers and firmware blobs are mostly proprietary I'd guess.

I believe that supplying software that only works on old hardware which is purchased at no benefit to the software creators will meet with restricted success. That's all.

Android Custom Rom without Google services installed. Android is Linux.
"never trust anyone ever.

Oh please tell us more about your 'launching soon' blockchain project you celebrity obsessed ovese fraud. 
Buy a Oneplus, install LineageOS, use Signal and Protonmail.
"So without the needless backlash (genuinely curious) where do iPhones stand in this? I’m under the impression that you’re relatively safe excluding the horrors of Facebook and similar data farming providers. Ever since that whole thing with the police wanting to get into a terrorists iPhone, it has seemed to me that unless someone REALLY needs to know if you have some terrorist plot to take over the world, prying eyes won’t be able to readily access your data, or at least very easily apart from Facebook and others like I’ve already said. 

IPhones don’t seem to come with Facebook and others already integrated into the OS without having to enable it first. "
Very true! China will never share the data to US. 
He is wrong, you need to buy a chinese phone inside china, fb, Twitter, YouTube and all those app that spies on you aren’t pre installed on a chinese phone inside china. 
Leave it up to Kim Dotcom to come up with unorthodox strategies. Not sure about this one man. haha.

Nice Way of thinking about that 
I think the point is that they can't do anything to you.
"Unfortunately, we won't see this come to fruition for some time.

It does certainly solve the baseband co-processor problem, especially with the hardware switches, which is something I previously envisioned solving by having a separate baseband ""router"" that my phone communicates to only with WiFi. Still kinda like my idea even if it's a little impractical with the librem 5 (hopefully) on its way."
That doesn't save you from Qualcomm and the OS which runs on the radio stack. That's where you put a backdoor because not even the (user) OS running on the device will know that it is comprised.
"How about Sony Xperia X flashed with Sailfish OS?

Mostly just stock Linux there, including GNU userspace and Wayland. (+ Alien Dalvik for running Android apps).

The Sony hardware itself could have backdoors, but on the software side that should be pretty safe?"
It was sarcasm friend.

Why don't you just not come to this subreddit?  That's what I do - if I don't like a subreddit or the people in it, then I simply just don't go to it.  Makes life much easier to focus on the things you like and enjoy rather than the things you hate.  Focusing on things you hate and expressing that hate, makes you a hater.

What wallet is private then?"

sadly bro, iphone 0days exploit are widely used. and since people with richer pockets tend to have iphone. it tend to also be more interesting to hack.
While it is closed source, so is Google Play Services, which is becoming an increasingly large part of Android in general. The iOS security whitepaper is actually really impressive, IMO: https://www.apple.com/business/docs/iOS_Security_Guide.pdf
"I would disagree with this. If you know you will be spied on, you shouldn’t let any information you wouldn’t want the government knowing about. 

The west spies on China and no one is to say that the western spy agencies don’t have a direct connection into the information China has via these phones (or via other means).  "
There is no way to know what happens with those since ios is 100%closed source
"Android is linux based genius....

Now that Ubuntu phone is dead the only option I know is Sailfish OS"
Ahem...SUCH AS?????
"Android uses the linux kernel.

It's usually not the OS that is backdoored (AOSP is open source as the name suggests) but Google's and Facebook's proprietary apps that come with all phones.

You can just get an AOSP custom rom and not get any proprietary apps, or at least none with root and sensor access.

Hardware backdoors are a whole another beast and they cannot be circumvented so easily. Most drivers are proprietary (most usually the modem ones) and SOC-level backdoors are entirely possible tok."
"The backdoors are not necessarily software based. All CPUs & SoCs these day have some sort of a ""secure element"" -- a separate chip running its own software and having unrestricted access to the main memory and the radios. "
Hold up, while we're talking Chinese phones and long term security support. Xiaomi supports their phones and brings out regular updates for a really long time. (I'm currently on a mi note 2, that went from android 6 to 7 to 8) and there's also plenty of custom roms. 
If you compile asop with 0 binary blobs (no camera blobs or anything) yourself you are probably safe from software spying. Just use a VPN for your carrier and you should be fine tbh.
I would agree with you not to store all your cryptocurrency in a phone wallet. However a phone wallet is fine for small amounts I think. i.e. < $200 USD to buy coffee, dinner, groceries or whatever. Just top it up every day (or when needed) from your cold wallet. A phone wallet is very convenient for payments on the go. It will be even more so when near field chip technology is enabled.
Mate series 
We're still not sure it will function without any proprietary blobs. For the time being, [Replicant](https://www.replicant.us/) (an android distribution based on LineageOS) is the best option. It doesn't come with any proprietary blobs and already closed [a built-in backdoor](https://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/replicant-developers-find-and-close-samsung-galaxy-backdoor) samsung put in the phones, that made it possible to control the phone through the modem. Unfortunately Replicant only supports a few devices ( Galaxy S2, S3 and Note2) and has some basic functionality missing. But if you want to be secure, care about your privacy and still want to use a mobile phone, it is the best option right now.
I would love a decent Linux phone. Heck, even a half-decent one. I looked into it recently and it's just really not a viable option. I might still get an older phone and get something running on that but I don't think I could bear to use something that old on the daily.
