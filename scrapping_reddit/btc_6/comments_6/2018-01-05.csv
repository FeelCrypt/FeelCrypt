Oh really tough guy?
Ver and his cronies have reached the main newspapers here in Australia. They are warning people to get rid of ALL their BTC and invest only in BCH. And Mrs General Q Public doesn't know the real story and is likely to believe them. Too low for words.
Ripple is a fucking SCAM when will you retards learn
"The most sane, level headed and honest post I have ever read about this market.
The market is too unstable to ever be more than speculative, this is the reason VISA dropped their crypto cards. People now condemming VISA calling them stuffy thieves etc, but the fact is its the crypto markets own fault they will never be seen as more than risky investments.
The volitility of their value makes it impossible to use them as currancy on a wide scale. Sure a few small shops will accept them but the big players wont, they do not have the time nor are they willing to invest millions in changing their hardware to enable that they change your crypto payment into FIAT INSTANTLY, why bother when there is a working system already in place.
Think of it this way, you go to wallmart spend $200, in the shop there are 300 other people also shopping, you get to the till and pay. Currently you pay $200 in FIAT, or via your debit card what ever, but Walmart is garenteed they getting $200. If you pay in BTC they have to change that into FIAT before they can use it, and they can not stop trading at your till to do this else other customers going to get pizzed at the delay because it takes time. So they have to wait before they can change it, by the time they do that BTC you paid could be worth $150. Now think of that with 50 000 customers, thats a $2 500 000, no way they going to allow that.
This is where ripple and most ether based caoins are differant they ""software"" applications but instead of generating money via traditional sales they generate it via coins which we trade. 
This is why BTC and all it derivatives are all going to die, they becoming to expensive for most people, their speeds suck, their transactions costs are ridiculous (its cheaper and faster to transfer money from Europe to the USA via Visa than via BTC) and they limited in what they can be used for.  The only real world application for BTC and its direct offspring is people who want to do shady deals with out the authorities knowing.
The Eth coins at least have real world applications and as such real world value. 
Blockchain tech is here to stay till the next invention pops up, but what we will see is less and less ICOs, also people will start demanding proof of ICO claims before giving money, all this due to the number of shady ICOs that are burning people and thus making them wiser.
Its a new field and we all are children running around without a care, but each time we fall we learn, so too will the developers as most of them are just like us. As we get older we will all get wiser, some of us will be lucky and make a lot while learning, others wont (dam market hates me LOL) But 10 years from now this industry will be booming, just walk slowly dont try become Bill Gates in 1 week, small steps till you learn to be steady then you can take big ones.  "
Chris isn't invovled in the operational or decision-making side of bitcoin.de afaik, but it's easy enough to contact bitcoin.de people. Fidor + bitcoin.de could actually do a BTC-autoload debit card if they wanted to, probably rather easily. I doubt it's on their radar, though.
If there's one thing that btc, bch, eth folks can agree on is that ripple is bullshit
Which coin boat do you row?
"Well the choice should be educated. I mean Ripple is not a Cryptocurrency.

But it is listed on all marketcap sites and advertised as one on exchanges.

And if it is listed so should be Webmoney, Paypal and all other pegged tokens.

Otherwise it just reeks with scam.

It either means when shit hits the fan people will be disgruntled with all cryptocurrencies or just dim them as scams for long time.

TL;DR: If it wouldn't affect the value of my investments in the future I wouldn't even bother. But it will eventually because it's just a donation right-waving token and people are tricked to think it is a cryptocurrency."
Son, I'm mot angry about people making money. I've been in this since 2013 so trust me I have my fair share. I'm angry about the market pricing inefficiently coins that have no fundamental value. 
100% I'm not in BTC. 90% is owned by 1% no thanks. This is the best short video I've seen so far explaining most of the main cons. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpCWCm4KbiM
Because you can't buy partial BTC or BCH, right? I can't believe that people who come into crypto do not even know they can buy partial coins for almost anything. It is probably the only reason that low value and high quantity shit coins interest them so much.
"The price dumping is a side effect of creating the ""free money"""
"> You don’t see corporations running off with their shareholders’ money overnight because it’s worth billions.

Because they can't. The shareholders are the owners of the company. Running of with money would land them in prison.


Nobody knows what Ripple will do (like just run-off with the money), but the risk is there because they have no legal obligation towards XRP holders. An additional risk, is that apparently, the XRP token isn't even an essential part of their activity and could just be abandoned. 
"
"They'll be the Wetland Yutani/Tyrell Corporation of the real world.

"I should have pointed out that I was being sarcastic. 

1. whataboutism
2. cherry picking
3. moving the goal posts to fit an argument
4. like you said, just doesn't make sense


Its funny because you didn't pick up on it being sarcasm, which just goes to show how much some people (not you) are in denial."
"Sure, no reason to dump while people are still buying in, hence the ""until people realize XRP is not used in most of Ripple products"", once they realize this and stop buying, that's when the dump will come - equivalent of selling a company when it becomes unprofitable (or more profitable to sell then continue)

> make Ripple into a multi trillion dollar company

that's the hard part, multi trillion dollar company? Not easy! Far easier to cash out once the gig is up, admittedly this can take some more years until it goes sideways."
"Because for investors, XRP's price *has* to go up to make any money.  Thats not true for Ripple: for Ripple, the cost basis of every XRP they sell is effectively $0.  Ripple could make billions of dollars just selling off 1 billion XRP/month, and driving down the price and leaving ""investors"" holding the bag.  Your interests are not as aligned as they'd like you to believe."

"> There is no mining so the XRP can't be premined.

&nbsp;

Holy shit

&nbsp;

> Also the notion that they can create more tokens would mean they would change the protocol which is open source.

&nbsp;

On other cryptos, the public runs the validators and nobody can change the amount without convincing the entire network to run software that changes the amount. On Ripple, Ripple Labs and only Ripple Labs run the validators and they can do anything they want, whenever they want. The software being open source isn't even remotely related to their ability to implement this change, and it indicates a complete lack of understanding on your part.

&nbsp;

Sorry to be more accurate it indicates a complete lack of understanding or an intent to knowingly mislead others with misinformation"
Is this supposed to be satire?
 I don’t think you understand crypto currency,  because what you’re writing doesn’t make sense. It sounds like you’re saying you prefer a private, controlled platform, where you have to trust the people running it, instead of a public, decentralized platform where you can examine all parts of it and don’t have to trust anyone. You’re in the wrong place my friend. 
"What about it being completely centralised and controlled by a single entity :)?
It doesn't even have a block chain, it's basically like usd but with a public ledger. "
"that ""4 guys in their dorm room"" is the reason why there are any cryptos, it was born after centralised institutions fucked over everyone in 2008..."
XRP is not a cryptocurrency.
Ripple isn't closed source. But it is centralized. 
It isn’t a cryptocurrency full stop
Try buying a loaf of bread with BTC, bch or ETH. You still need banks to hold your fiat.
"Analogy of the media is wrong imo.

It's the same billionaires which went from newspapers to blogs. Its not that people starting opening blogs and newspapers thought ""omg we're gonna die""

no. NYT was a newspaper, extends its presence online too. Problem solved.

Same with banks. They can extend their presence in the blockchain too, via ripple.

I dont believe in a second that crypto will replace fiat, not in a million years.

Money is already digital. We get paid in ones and zeros and rarely use cash.

I see Ripple as the Wordpress of the crypto. If banks want to have their blockchain, but dont want to start from scratch, here's ripple, ready to use it."

Do you honestly think the worlds most regulated and slow to change industry is just going to change there entire set up at the snap of a finger because some new, untested tech comes out? Most banks just started using online and mobile banking for christ sakes. 
They can change the protocol anytime they want. They own all the nodes.
That was very weak.
Really ? You have to be [this] disinformed to post what you posted.
"You claim to be able to ""defeat"" every point he makes. But your ""arguments"" are just you stating, this is wrong, this is wrong, this is wrong, ...

You haven't actually argued anything. What is this? You find this compelling?
"
Sweet gain!
Chance for bridge collapse is more likely.
True.
So does this mean that it's not likely to make a profit if you tried to sell the ripple you already have when it's goes up in value?
Holy shit man, have you done any due diligence on this? 
"Yes, I caught that too. The 100b is hardcoded into the protocol so it's not trivial to change (not infeasible though). But there is really no need to ""print more"" when you posses 60-80% of it. You just release (sell) what you already have, it has the same effect as printing. "
"I could defeat almost every point he makes. Bitcoin is not functioning as an alternative to banking, so his first point is not only misleading but it has nothing to do with Ripple. His second point that Ripple is ""solely designed to help the banks maintain their position."" Actually no, it was designed by Ripple to help make them money, by filling a weakness in the way banks handle International transactions. ""Ripple and X R P aren't the same thing."" You don't say? Anyone whos done even a little bit of research on Ripple already knows that. The information isn't being concealed. ""Banks aren't using Ripple."" That's just outright false. ""100 percent premined."" This person doesn't understand what the word premined means. Dash is Premined. Ripple is not. Basically this person believes in stereotypical nefarious banker conspiracy theories. They're living in a fantasy land."
Haha. I found this hilarious. 
"Wow, nice conspiracy theory! I like conspiracies, but this is a little far fetched... Ripple (opencoin) existed even before Bitcoin was born. It’s not Ripple that wants to fight other cryptos, in fact it’s quite the opposite, the Interledger protocol they are working on can benefit any crypto. The truth is that it’s Bitcoin and other crypto communities that fight Ripple. Crypto anarchists, cypher punks and libertarians. Maybe you are too caught up in your warrior mentality to realize this? They don’t want to undermine the rest of the crypto space goddamn, they are working to bring it all more mainstream and interoperable!!

Why all the hate? Let me guess: pure greed. “Must... kill... competition... “. Maybe the people who invested in mining hardware see the threat of a different crypto that does not require mining and consuming awful amount of energy in the process? Maybe they get nervous to see it is slowly taking the lead and rendering their hardware useless? Quick! We must fight this!! Haha! Hypocrites! 

What’s funny is that they tell everyone it’s supposed to be the crypto used by the banks they want to destroy and everybody must hate XRP for that reason. It seems no other crypto wants to work with the banks, so what’s the threat and fear all about if it’s not even a market you all target? What are you so nervous about? If you are so convinced it will fail, why do you spread FUD every time it goes up?"
I feel the same.
Then the 'crypto space' better get their act together. This move has been a long time in the making. Ripple now has market dominance, and unlike the weary withered BTC, it's actually got an actionable plan for growth.
Sod it all for eth after 400% gains. It’s a shit coin but I’m happy to let idiots hold the bag. 
I'm subscribed to your youtube channel.  Keep up the good work!
You make many good points but there's a couple inaccuracies. There is no mining so the XRP can't be premined. Also the notion that they can create more tokens would mean they would change the protocol which is open source. This is no different than saying one of the BCH devs could change the number of BCH coins if they wanted. I think the CEO came out yesterday and said some banks are using xRapid. So either he's lying or your claim that no one is using xRapid is also not true. I support BCH but it is best to be accurate. 
What do you mean?
"5. they own 60% of their own product at the moment so why should i invest if i only get 0.0000000001%
6. they are going to try to get down the price of the product that they own now 60%
7. they are just going to take your money and run away"
"1. They are working towards decentralization in a healthy way, without flooding the markets using the escrow. 
2. Banks/FI’s...
3. Source? And why would they do that? Bank A won’t use a coin invented by Bank B, that’s where Ripple comes.
4. This doesn’t make sense.  If they need to settle billions, they will need liquidity, hence the price will obviously go up."
[deleted]
Good video.
lol, just cracks me up. Thanks for your video, it was enlightening.
In crypto nothing is a lock-on.  We all take our chances.
The butthurt is strong over that
"Pretty much. XRP was an ingenious way for Ripple to raise funding. They create a token on their network, one that the network actually doesn't even need to operate. And they make sure to hold most of the tokens.

Then they let the price of XRP rise based on news that effects Ripple. People are dumb and think Ripple=XRP so they buy up XRP. All the while Ripple is selling off its XRP holdings as more get released from escrow each month.

So smart move for Ripple, they get to raise a ton of funds off of pre-mined coins, and they don't have to give up any equity. But bad for whoever is holding XRP once the market realizes this."
Please start this petition! Im so tired of all the opaqueness anf people getting fooled about this. Look, if this was a legit crypto currency the founders would make a technical video explaining exactly how it works and answer clearly all the questions people are asking. They would point to a production implementation used by a real bank and explain why, how and what percentage of all internbank bank transactions actually use ripple and point at realized cost savings AND have all the results peer reviewed by an unbiased third party.. else GTFO! Nobody who knows anything about crypto believes you!
How could that be... XRP has been in the playing field since early 2010, why wait so long to cash grab now?
Nice try JP Morgan
That’s your opinion (or conspiracy), but maybe you are wrong? Ripple is using this crypto to solve a REAL WORLD problem. It’s called “cross border payments”. If you ever used SWIFT yourself you would understand it is a much needed upgrade for everyone including you and me. XRP is what will be used on RippleNet by XRapid to SETTLE funds between banks and payment providers.
Surely his safe space would be /r/ripple ?
So are you saying the xrp you and I are buying has no value?
"[xRapid](https://ripple.com/solutions/source-liquidity/), one of the the products they offer, 100% use XRP in all transactions for starters.

But if you've done a modicum of research you would realize their strategy isn't to force anyone to use XRP, which is why they offer the entire suite of products they offer. Having them adopt Ripplenet is step one and eventually they'll gravitate towards the lowest cost/most efficient settlement method, which for many use cases will be via XRP. 

Using XRP (you know, or a similar competitive currency) to free up funds held in these nostro accounts is a huge boon. This is a GIANT industry, and no doubt there will be some stiff competition for these TRILLIONS of dollars. Nobody's claiming that this is the only liquidity solution that ever has the chance to be adopted, but if I'm throwing money down today I'm putting it on the dudes with the head start.

EDIT: Also forgot, but Cualix definitely does use xRapid and XRP for cross-border transactions (and this is several months old news): https://coin.fyi/news/ripple/first-financial-institution-uses-xrp-to-solve-the-liquidity-problem-75h2iq

I'll get it through my thick skull when I see your source that debunks mine."
The higher the price, the greater incentive to create more 
They can just use fractions of xrp. It makes no sense that the price has to stay low or super stable for it to work. The whole point is how fast it is. You won't be losing money when your transaction moves faster than the volatility.
"Then I guess I should have said ""since I read about it, it seemed like the banks way of getting in on crypto and trying to sway people away from the decentralization idea so they could still get a cut"""
2004 Ripple is not the same as present Ripple.
ripple the currency or ripple labs the company?
fair enough. My bad.
"I think he meant because it makes people want to use ETH & BCH more.    
(because of the dislike towards centralized xrp)"
"I love it too. Because it's an industry crypto.

I trust more a crypto backed by a stable, financial industry than a crypto created by 4 guys in their dorm because it's cool now

I dont care that it is closed source. So is Apple. But people dont care, they want a fast, functional product.

I'd rather have a closed source smartphone created by Apple than an open source created by 5 shady chinese dudes in their dorm"
Because it is not cryptocurrency but for some reason shilled everywhere like a cryptocurrency?
"Not for that reason

Try again"
"> whats wrong with that?

Is it really hard to understand why people hate banks?

> banks are here to stay, no crypto will make them useless.

They can be made less relevant, which is exactly what happened to traditional media when the internet came along. Sure, newspapers still exist, but they have a lot less power now than they did before. 

> Grow up

Ditto"
That's the thing though. XRP isn't backed by the banks. Ripple Labs is backed by the banks. Over Ripple the platform people can exchange IOUs for just about anything including  EUR, USD, and even Bitcoin. That's what Ripple's value is to the banks. XRP is just an other token that exists on this platform that unlike the others isn't an IOU for anything, it's free floating. People don't understand this and equate XRP to the same is Ripple Labs. Banks will find value in Ripple Labs, they'll find zero value in XRP. 
You should buy some BCH, have a bit of both.
What price does XRP need to reach in order to be off the top spot in terms of market cap?
"I've always said BTC, BCH and crypto at large should recognize that the bigger threat is not one another, it's banks and govt regulation. Well here we are. Here's ripple.

Ref: https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7cfo55/refocusing_on_the_real_threat_to_cryptocurrency/"
At least it has a better cause then Ripple
It's a closed and unregulated corporate entity, so presumably the CEO or his appointee.
Solid road map, growing market, good fundamentals, strong team, read the white paper, undervalued, powerful use case, pretty wallet.
Its not about 4 dudes in a dorm. Its about market. If the market decides something has value then it does. XPR is not a criptocurrency.
">  than an open source created by 5 shady chinese dudes in their dorm

Dude, open source has real value in the world. Just because you don't interact with it on a first-hand basis everyday doesn't mean it doesn't run your life. 

Linux powering 96.6%	 of the web.

Android / WP / Apache and a shit load more."
Then you should just join the central bankers because you clearly don’t get decentralization and crypto. 
No you retard. It won’t hit $10
More people buying increases the value 
"I would like to hear your thoughts on what is easier and more profitable than Ripple selling XRP that anyone can buy whether it’s a bank, a corporation or someone’s grandma. 

The CEO as well as top execs are most likely bound by a contractual agreement where they can’t cash out and dump all their coins, just like one of the cofounders is. And another reason is greed. Why settle for being a billionaire when you can be a trillionaire? It’s why crypto goes up like crazy, everyone buying in who wants more out of it. "

Then it would seem it would make more sense that banks use a different token that isn't public, so they do not have to subject themselves to the volatility. 
"No, volatility of XRP matters A LOT, because Bank #2 now has to purchase illiquid UAH at a later date with that XRP.
"
The average crypto coder is already more concerned with your privacy than the average person (otherwise they wouldn't be in cryptography in the first place), so they start out ahead of the game.
how long did the internet take to build?
"None of this is accurate. SMS was developed in 1992. 

Right now, with crypto currency, you can transact, store value, send messages, store data, play games, gamble, etc, etc. Cryptocurrency transfers value faster than any other platform. And we’re only at the beginning."
"> 10 years and NO real life use yet. None.

No real life use in your life doesn't equate no real life use. It's used in sufficiently ""real"" life that it's been adopted in locations of the world where the local currency was unstable, it's been adopted for transactional use on black markets, it's been used to remit money between family members across nations, and for all of these very real uses, it's served a very real purpose.

&nbsp;

If you understand the technical aspects of how it works, XRP isn't anything you've described it as, and you don't know what the fuck you're doing here. You're just a lucky chump who's getting rich at the expense of whoever will be holding the bag when it dumps. I already know *you're* fine with ripping those people off, but I'm not so"
Currently Ripple Labs runs all the validater nodes for XRP so if they disappeared so would it. Though they do plan to somewhat decentralize the network by given other third parties validater nodes but that's still somewhat centralized. 
"The 'community' has no vote in this. They don't own nodes. Only the node owners, IE the Ripple team has a vote.  They have a 100% voting weight in the protocol and can change it as they please. Change transaction times, total supply, cancel transactions it's all on the table.  
For a coin to actually have community consensus the nodes should be spread among the community, the further dispersed the better.   
"
"The holy shit is in regards to trying to say 'it's not a premine because there's no mining'. I don't give a shit that there's no mining, I give a shit that they just whipped up 100 billion XRP out of thin air and held all of it until they distributed it. When people say 'premine' nobody gives a fuck about mining or not, they give a fuck about *fair distribution*. People have proven they don't even mind premines, as long as they're not terribly severe - see Dash as an example. If Ripple held only 10% of the current supply right now, people wouldn't really care. But they don't. They hold more than *half.* 

&nbsp;

Regarding validators, those are permissioned, which... I don't know how you don't understand this still, but they are the *ultimate arbiters* of what happen on their network. Whether it be enforcing civil forfeiture of your assets against your will at the behest of a government, blacklisting your assets because they may have been used for activity they didn't like, or simply creating more money out of thin air, they can do that on their network, and you cannot do that on other public crypto networks.

&nbsp;

> I used to think all these things until I did my own research.

&nbsp;

I don't know what to tell you - the above facts are still facts, and the distribution problems aside it's a centralized currency that Ripple Labs has ultimate control over, and that *isn't a fact that's up for debate.*"
"It's ""fella"""
"Yes, the risk you are mentioning is inherent to all cryptos. 

The risks I mentioned in my previous comment are only applicable to XRP and not the other main cryptos."
Well, it's now number 2,and I don't remember anyone predicting that. 
"Seriously, what’s wrong with that ?

I know that in the past recent XRP bull runs, was due to people FOMO and believing that big banks will be using block chain technology.

so, nothing personal here mate, just another coin to get you some big gains."
"> Ripple only profits when the XRP token is valuable to public and banks.

Why the public part?"
"You're assuming that ""maximizing profit"" is the same thing as ""maximizing the long-term value of XRP"".  There are many scenarios where that assumption doesn't hold.  There's also the amount of XRP that held by the CEO and other employees.  I mean, when you can just sell out now and be the richest people in the world without any additional effort, why not?"
Why is everyone saying it’s going to beat out BTC in marketcap. That will only happen if BTC is stagnant. We all know out of the blue, BTC is going to make a huge run. 
Good bot
"There’s a lot of things about xrp that makes it stand out from every other crypto out there which is exactly why it can either go very very bad or very very well for xrp. I’m just a part of the group betting on the latter ;)

The way I see it is that I can either lose my investment (I bought in at $.30) or become an xrp millionaire someday. The pros far outweigh the cons for me. "
"Yes they hold more than half with a scheduled release of 1B a month max until they run out. This information is literally everywhere. What that does is if the demand is more than 1B a month then you have to buy it somehow right? This is in the protocol as well by the way. Stop saying they can create things out of thin air when any crypto could do that by changing the protocol. By the way, they already sold 1B for this month and in December had buys of 700M and 900M. Someone is buying XRP in massive amounts. It's all on the public ledger. 

Validators are not permissioned. I could go setup one up right now if I wanted: https://ripple.com/build/rippled-setup/#reasons-to-run-a-validator . Could a validator censor you? Sure could, but anyone can run a validator. I liken XRP to something like what BTC could do with LN(if they ever get it done lol) so there are certainly risks with censorship and heavy enterprise involvement. Enterprises have to follow regulations and are never going away. 

Geez man do you do any research? XRP is not perfect but I am so tired of all this FUD when one crypto rocks. Attacking ADA, XLM, others just because they move higher on CMC. "
"Any coin where a team owns more than either 20% (and that's already pushing it, some coins are fully dispersed) of the total supply and/or 50% of the voting weight (that includes miners) is an outright scam.   
There's plenty of coins that don't trigger these giant red flags. However Ripple is really taking the cake with 100% voting weight and 2/3rds of the total supply.   
> Do you really think you have any kind of protection or that any of those people in power owes you anything?!  

That's exactly my point. Thanks for finally catching on.  

> You seem to like conspiracy theories, yet you can’t even think about the scenario that Bitcoin could also just be a scheme to make money from all the people who want a change (whatever it is) after the financial crisis?  

Oh absolutely. I don't own Bitcoin and I would love to see it die for an actual decentralized coin to take it's place.  

> It’s already been mentioned that the people who bought XRP are not shareholders, but yet you come here to tell me the shareholders won’t be informed of an incoming dump. I’m confused.  

Shareholders will be informed as per the law or the team commits insider trading fraud. XRP holders are not shareholders and don't have this protection. They can and will be the first to receive a fresh dump on their holdings if the company needs the funds to stay afloat. 

> the exchange owners (big holders) have insider knowledge nothing stops them to dump their holdings before the rest of the world.  

People who keep their coins on these exchanges are just as naive as those who bought XRP.  "
"> How anyone can be this naive is beyond me. You're not a shareholder you merely act like one. You don't get the protection and transparency shareholders have, the company owes you nothing.  

Just like any crypto out there!! Hahaha! 

Were you present at the New York agreement meeting? Did you have any power over the outcome of that meeting? 

Who’s Naive? You are being sold a big great fantasy: let’s destroy the banks and we can all be freeeee yayyyyyyyy! Haha! Do you even realize you are being manipulated by a few people already (the big miners, the core developers, the exchange owners, etc.). 

Do you really think you have any kind of protection or that any of those people in power owes you anything?! And it’s me who is naive? Haha! Brainwashed maybe? Yeah Bitcoin is the lord saviour coming to save us all from the tyranny of the banking system!! I know! 

You seem to like conspiracy theories, yet you can’t even think about the scenario that Bitcoin could also just be a scheme to make money from all the people who want a change (whatever it is) after the financial crisis? That would make sense too, doesn’t it? But we can’t think like that against our saviour, don’t we? Ever heard of cognitive dissonance? 

> In any scenario of financial down-turn, it's the ripple holders that will be dumped upon to free up funds. Probably even before they start sanitising anywhere else.

And you think the early Bitcoin adopters won’t dump their Bitcoins on the market if there is any sign it is going down? Again, it’s like that in any crypto, what’s your point?

> They have an infinite amount of coins to throw at you long before the shareholders are informed and even longer before any bad news about the company is published.  

Most of the XRP reserves Ripple owns are already in Escrow. The banks who buy large reserves of XRP by contract with Ripple can’t dump it all, it’s all part of the agreement. Same thing with the cofounders and Ripple employees. Can you say the same thing about Satoshi and it’s millions of BTC? 

It’s already been mentioned that the people who bought XRP are not shareholders, but yet you come here to tell me the shareholders won’t be informed of an incoming dump. I’m confused. Again, XRP is just like any other crypto out there, if the other crypto’s developers, the miners, the exchange owners (big holders) have insider knowledge nothing stops them to dump their holdings before the rest of the world. Again, what’s your point? What’s the difference?"
You mean decentralized in the hands of a few big miners? Great!
">  their interest to make it successful is aligned with mine and that’s fine!

"> XRP is a protocol. Open source. I could go create XRP Cash if I wanted with 100M coins and start my own validators so people can decide to run whatever they want to.

This is a true statement. What you might not have understood here is that **you** would be the one with total control over this network, and nobody would use it because you have total control over this network. You'd also be the central point that others would attempt to use to exert control the network - example, governments.

&nbsp;

If you were to take that protocol, and add a method of decentralized validation to secure the network outside of your hands, that would effectively relinquish control, and people would potentially actually use that network. The process of Proof of Work mining and Proof of Stake validation is what serves this decentralized validation process for other networks that are not Ripple."
I don't think those words mean what you think they mean. Am I ripping off the grocery store when I buy goods? Or are they scamming me out of my money when I walk out with what I went in there to buy? 
"Whaaaaaat? Did you really try to understand what I wrote? I’m not trying to pretend XRP is not controlled by Ripple at all, what the hell?! I’m saying it is controlled for now and it’s a good thing because the leadership helps get things done. 

I’m saying they DO have a plan to decentralize their validators network. It’s all out there!

> Ripple owns their coin holders *nothing* they're not the customers. 

So what? They do own a lot of XRP, their interest to make it successful is aligned with mine and that’s fine! You think the Bitcoin miners owes anything to the Bitcoin holders? Haha! Then why is it that slow and fees are skyrocketing when the mempool gets full? You really think it can not be solved by now? Yeah, keep your head in the sand!

> Ripple answers to their shareholders and the people who want to exchange funds. That's all, if there's ever a decision that could lower the currency's value (like increasing supply or denying  transactions) then they'll take it in a heartbeat.   

Yeah, people like you and me also “want to exchange their funds”, so I guess we are in your equation, nice! Stop pretending Ripple don’t care at all about their users and community. They are targeting the banks and payment providers for now, that’s right, but it’s a big assumption to think they don’t care about users like you and me. They do care about their community, their chief cryptographer David Schwartz (Joel Katz) is very active on social medias. We are an important part of the equation, it helps with the liquidity. And it’s not because they are focusing on the banks and payment providers that they will never expand their use case to peer-to-peer in the future. That’s a bit shortsighted to think it will stop there, doesn’t it?

Why would they want to lower the value? Please explain! Of course they want the value to be higher, it will reduce volatility and they own a lot of it, so it’s also in their best interest to have a higher price. Right now if they tackle just a small slice of the pie in the market they are going after, at the actual price there just would not be enough XRP in existence to cover the funds they want to move. The price absolutely needs to be higher for the system to be efficient. The higher the better!

"
XRP is a protocol. Open source. I could go create XRP Cash if I wanted with 100M coins and start my own validators so people can decide to run whatever they want to. The same principles apply that you just described for ETH, BCH. This is crazy. 
... 
You do realize most of the people buying btc are “normies” and whales but not big banks and corporations and yet it got to $20k per btc recently? It’s no different than that but now you throw in the banks and corporations also buying xrp. What you hold as a “normie” in xrp goes up in value when more people or banks buy. 
"""I'm not ripping them off because free market, they deserve to be scammed if they didn't do their research lol"""
"You're trying to have your cake and eat it here. You want to pretend Ripple isn't completely controlled by the Ripple team but at the same time argue why that's a good thing.

> Leadership can be a good thing to push things forward instead of getting caught up in perpetual fight.  

Yeah that's the central banking argument.   "
"> Stop saying they can create things out of thin air when any crypto could do that by changing the protocol.

lol you don't get it, do you? If programmers for say, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, whatever announced 'we're going to increase the limit of money that will be mined, and the money that is mined with each block', everyone that is participating in the chain would have to agree that they liked this, and choose to run the software. If they don't, the network hard forks and some stay on the old chain with the old rules - and of course, if the rules change they attempted to implement was disagreeable, nobody is going to run it. They can't change it. They have no enforcement method.

&nbsp;

Ripple on the other hand can do anything they want on their network. Period."
"On a serious note, I agree with you, nobody can predict anything that's heading our way, people can guess but they have no better idea than you or I. All this fud and ""predicting"" on reddit is actually quite hilarious to read "
Lol.. I would bet you $1k USD that it does hit $10 per xrp this year. 
I see that. But mostly ripple and xrp are targeted to banks and big institutions. So what is it for a normie to have any xrp in eyes of ripple. The value is mostly grow with huge volume aka banks buying xrp. Not normies with 100-1000 dollars. Just thinking and trying to find answers...
Don't they currently use USD as the base currency? With forex I'm pretty sure everything goes through USD first. But yea maybe that's a good idea and why Ripples most popular product is the one that doesnt use xrp (yet?)
You can't rip somebody off when they are making a decision to buy something on their own. If I bought it for a dollar and he will spend $5 for it. That's him making a decision as a buyer and me making one as a seller. Welcome to the free market
"You know you can run a validator just like you can run a miner, right? 

Yes for now Ripple controls the validators and it’s a good thing, it helps the protocol to update seamlessly. We are at the beginning of it all it’s a good thing to keep a kind of control for now. They already implemented over 80 updates so far. Just look at bitcoin and it’s community continually fighting each other over any update to the protocol. Leadership can be a good thing to push things forward instead of getting caught up in perpetual fight. 

They do have a plan to decentralize their network of validators in the future, it’s been explained numerous times. Please continue your research."
Sorry... you are right...
In that case, here's an idea.  Don't buy it and allow others to make their own choice.
I mean if i can empty my wallet
I assume you mean sending 1 XRP for $1m or sending 1m XRP for $1 yea? My guess is that the issue is whoever is holding the xrp to use as a bridge will want it to be super stable so they don't need to worry about their overall value going crazy
"> I'm angry about the market pricing inefficiently coins that have no fundamental value.

Which coin actually has a fundamental value?"
You can but doesn’t change the part where 1 btc = $12-20k usd. Nothing has inherent value, it’s just whatever everyone agrees on. So XRP hitting $50 isn’t impossible or would even be absurd at some point in the future. 
"There is always an inherent risk in any investment; for all we know, the US could outlaw all cryptos tomorrow and the whole market crashes. Lol.. nobody knows what will happen to crypto, period. "
Why does it matter that xrp is not used in most Ripple products? When you look at any big company, they have a “bread and butter” product along with other fillers that are just there for the sake of making their core product look AMAZING in comparison. For example, Apple purposefully releases iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X at the same time. Why? Because the 8 makes the X look amazing so more people will buy the most expensive one, therefore making more profits for Apple. A strategic company will provide different options for customers but always promote and sell their bread and butter product to make the most money and that’s exactly what xrp is to Ripple. Bread and butter. 
Ripple is run by a CEO and Board of Directors, they have to carefully assess every decision they make and how the public will respond, and how it will affect the company’s future. This isn’t a group of teenage kids who will run off with your money overnight, these are professionals in the Finance and Tech world who will be held accountable. If Ripple screws over the people who put billions into funding them, the company (no matter what new products they try to sell next) will not survive the public’s hatred and backlash long term. 
"for it to reach $10 it would mean it will have 380 billion in market, surpassing Bitcoin. 

don't know if it's likely "
Keep on dreaming, might as well share a bit of that dream with everyone else. 
No bank is going to pay Ripple a billion dollars for the 1 billion XRP per month they are selling if the coin is worth $.001 on the market. Ripple is a corporation and like all corporations, they are driven by the desire to maximize their profits.. which is done by increasing price of XRP so they can sell it for more to banks. Ripple only profits when the XRP token is valuable to public and banks.

No, you'd lose two times the transaction fees, including chain and platform fees.

"No organisation that has FIAT nostro’s in currency pairs is going to use XRP as a cross currency when they have already agreed the FIAT amounts they are going to exchange. By volume this is the majority of the interbank market.

"> It makes no sense that the price has to stay low or super stable for it to work. 

The main use of a bridge currency (like XRP) is when one party can't deliver some illiquid 3rd world currency.

> One of the specific functions of XRP is as a bridge currency, which can be necessary if no direct exchange is available between two currencies at a specific time, for example when transacting between two rarely traded currency pairs. 

> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ripple_(payment_protocol)#As_a_bridge_currency

Bank #1 Says: ""I can't deliver Ukrainian Hryvnia (UAH) right now. How about I send you a bridge currency?""

Bank #2 Says ""Ok, fine. Send me the bridge currency, and I'll use it to buy Ukrainian Hryvnia (UAH) later""

Bank #2 would prefer a stable bridge currency, that isn't fluctuating wildly based on McAfee tweets and crazy day traders.  

Which is why I won't be surprised if Ripple later releases a stable token that is USD-pegged (or pegged to a basket of currencies) that banks can use as a stable bridge currency.

"Does fundamental really matter? All these company coins pumping really make me believe that the market pricing efficiency is a joke, it is all about price manipulation for almost anything, as long as you have enough capital to do that

"That's the entire point.  Bank #1 never has to have any Ukrainian Hyravnia, and nobody ever has to hold on to the bridge currency. Your link answers this itself:

>Ripple's design focus is as a currency exchange and a distributed-RTGS, as opposed to emphasizing XRP as an alternative currency. In April 2015, Ripple Labs announced that a new feature called autobridging had been added to Ripple, with the intent of making it easier for market makers to transact between rarely traded currency pairs.

So the dumbed down version is Bank #1 purchases XRP in their native currency, and sends that XRP to Bank #2. Bank #2 receives XRP and sells it in their native currency, for example UAH. This entire process takes seconds and Bank #2 now has the UAH they asked for and Bank #1 never needed to have access to UAH in the first place. It doesn't really matter if the value of XRP is volatile day by day because the transactions happen so fast. 

But the value of XRP is not currently high enough to provide the liquidity needed if hundreds of banks around the world adopted this, and anybody holding XRP right now will be sitting pretty if it reaches that level. "

Did I say they aren't relevant right now? 
If Apple ever was bought, or collapsed spectacularly, you would be compensated according to your % of shares. Literally if they fired everyone and sold the physical assets, they would be legally required to pay you. Owning a share means you are a 0.00000001% owner of apple, can in theory if not in practice vote on important company matters, and the CEO and Board of Directors are accoubtable to you. XRP, and almost every crypto for that matter, does not grant you ownership over anything save the currency itself. 
"First of all that's not true. Apple has a dividend yield of 1.46%. It also gives you ownership in Apple and voting rights along with those shares. 

XRP isn't a share though there's no voting rights, there's no ownership over the company, and there certainty isn't any dividend. It's just an other centralized currency that they market as such rather than an ICO so that the SEC doesn't get up all over them."

Braindead analogy
Yeah, what’s content delivery? Why would you need that in a decentralised way? Let’s stick to the usual channels. That’s what we are all here for.
"Oh, yes! Yes I do! The banking industry is well aware of the problems of the outdated SWIFT system. 

It’s not a new and untested tech, it’s been running tests in some major banks and payment providers for a while. The test phase is ending, it is going in production this year. Cualix is already using it.

And why would it have to be “in a snap of a finger”? Things will come into place when time will come, one step at a time: first they implement the RippleNet software, then they can use XRP to exchange value between each other when they are all connected on the network. Patience maybe? 🤷🏼‍♂️"
Like any other crypto, decentralized or not, if they reach community consensus, what’s your point?
You're not going to destroy banks by buying Bitcoin. Fly, you fools.
"There are plenty of non-PoW cryptos out there with ETH already planning to move to PoS which doesn't mine. Mining is not the only way to have value.

How much does it cost to run a validator?

"While I'm not saying ripple is a funding scheme per sé I personally see it more like a test network for Ripple labs with a bonus for getting some nice investment money out of it.

The mass buying crypto's probably doesn't know they are not on the same network as the bank. If you figured out people don't know about this but are gonna invest heavily, why not chip in yourself? Kinda risky investment strategy IMO but for some it clearly worked out.

Now I'm waiting till the mass finds out and all the alts get a huge boost =D"
It is quite possible, however if the crypto scene is as strong as we often think this attempt at killing BTC should fail. If it's just a get rich quick scheme for us, then we will get played by the banks like a fiddle.

"/u/don-wonton thanks for making the video. What I find compelling is understanding which parts of Ripple (company) are compelling  and where XRP fits into it. To that extent, I think this is helpful.

However, soapboxing about how they want to make money is ineffective. So what? We all want to make money. Saying something was created for profit doesn't make it bad. I don't care that the guy who sold me a sandwich today was interested in lining his pockets. 

To the extent that the video becomes an anti-banking screed, it loses it's effectiveness. The reason people want to buy XRB is because they see banks adopting Ripple (company). Clearly showing how those are two unrelated things is the right way to go."

If you want something to succeed just work for it to make it better and accepted everywhere. Bring arguments to the table on why it is good, people can understand that.

">If Ripple is an interbank settlment system, and XRP are bridge currency, then if XRP ever became too expensive,

XRP needs to be high enough to be functional. It can’t really be “too expensive”. The higher the better. Let’s say you have 1000$ to transfer with XRP, from which there only exist 100 units priced at 1$. You just could not transfer all your 1000$ in one transaction because there is not enough XRP in existence to cover the amount to transfer. You would need to have a 10$ XRP and to own 100% of all the XRP in existence to transfer your whole 1000$ in one transaction. Or you would need the price to climb to 20$ if you only own 50% of circulating supply (50XRP x 20$ = 1000$). The more it will be used, the higher it will need to be. It’s not really a problem.

If XRP was ever going to become too expensive in your scenario, there are still decimals of XRP, if XRP cost too much per unit you would just send a fraction of a unit like Bitcoin, what’s the problem? This is exactly what is happening right now with bitcoin, people are less and less buying a complete unit at the actual price.

> the banks could just create Ripple2 & XRP2 as a 2nd settlement network, and so on.

Why create a Ripple 2 and XRP2? You mean like Bitcoin cash, Gold, diamond and whatnot?

This is the kind of mess you get with decentralized currencies when the community disagrees. This is one of the advantages of centralization.

Or maybe you mean a second layer settlement like the lightning network? I don’t think it’s necessary, why would they do that?

XRP can handle everything by itself, it is at the center of Ripple, they are incentivized to make it succeed because they do own a lot of it. Why create competition to their own product? It doesn’t really make sense. I think it’s far more plausible they would propose an update to the XRP protocol to meet it’s requirements without harming it’s value.

But after all, let’s push your argument to the limit, when another crypto forks, the users of the old chain often get the new chain’s tokens, what would stop Ripple from doing the same if they create a XRP2? Why does it have to be a bad thing for everyone?

>There might be a max supply for XRP in Ripple.  But there's nothing that blocks Ripple and the banks from creating & using multiple settlement networks.

You’re right, there is nothing stopping the banks from using multiple settlement networks. They don’t force XRP on them, which is a good thing. But XRP is custom built to be efficient on the Ripple network. It’s fast, it’s cheap, it’s stable. But most importantly it replaces the Nostro accounts!! RippleNet alone saves 30% to the banks, but between 42% and 60% when they use XRP. This represents a lot of money for them. I think they could be interested in using it. Some partners already expressed they are interested in using XRP. It’s all out there.

After all, why use something else when you already trust Ripple enough to use their software? Why reinvent the wheel and spend ressources to develop your own crypto when there is already an existing and efficient solution available? 

Yeah, maybe for internal use a custom token could be useful, who knows. But what will they use to settle between each other’s crypto? Maybe XRP could be useful?

Or do you mean the banks would need to hold every other bank’s crypto in your scenario? What would be the difference between that and the actual system? The whole point of XRP is to be the intermediary between everyone’s currency. To eliminate Nostro accounts or even the need to hold any other bank’s crypto (in your scenario).
"
You can apply that logic to pretty much anything though. Bitcoin cash did exactly that to bitcoin core. Someone else could do the exact same to bitcoin cash - doesn't make it worthless
Since Ripple is centralized there's nothing that stops Ripple from increasing the max supply of XRP other than their promise to cap it. 
That’s why you guys should buy XLM (Stellar).
"> But there's nothing that blocks Ripple and the banks from creating & using multiple settlement networks.

pretty much, they do not care about the price when it's used just as bridge currency. and they take a lot of risk when they believe it might be overvalued, so why not create another one when it comes to that."
"XRP is definitely a wonky currency. The premining + nearly unlimited future tokens make me extremely reluctant.

I see Ripple holding value, not growing in value. There's nothing wrong with a company that is trying to solve problems, but I think the investment should be in the company, not the currency.

Also, I'm still waiting on a fortune 500 company to use this currency to reduce fees. "
...no? Speak for yourself
It smelled like a scam from the start. Just banks trying to get in on it before they were forced out.
I agree. I’m pretty vocal about crypto, and multiple friends have asked me about ripple lately. It’s nuts. We need to get the word out 
"XRP is an attractive asset for liquidity providers to create liquidity between any two currencies at incremental cost. To offset the risk of bridging currencies with a new asset like XRP, we plan to subsidize its use in the early days. With XRP, market makers systemwide can offer tighter spreads than traditional currency markets, fast-tracking Ripple’s path to market thickness. 

This offer is immediately compelling to small to mid-sized banks, which today rely on large correspondents to provide liquidity for cross-border payments. By sourcing liquidity from thirdparties who make markets through XRP, smaller banks can offer more competitively priced payment services to attract new customers. 

Initially, large banks will continue to source liquidity from their own FX operations and improve their processing efficiency using Ripple. However, as Ripple’s currency market grows, large banks will see benefit to posting and sourcing liquidity to and from it as well.
"
I'm an ETH and Bitcoin cash supporter. I love XRP
Forgive my ignorance but why? 
My short answer? No. This company has been around longer than Bitcoin has. 
The whole crypto community should come together and force this coin out. It's would be a bonding experience.
"If XRP rises in value, so too does the amount of liquidity, (aka more cash is able to move from place to place).

Even if it is a ""placeholder/bridge"" between two end users, if anything it's in the banks using the Ripple technology's best interest to keep the price up."

This will show the general direction we all want to go towards.

This sub is way too interested in trying to bring everyone else down instead of elevating bitcoin cash. Ripple is a huge bubble, but so is everything else in crypto right now.
Hey Don, your videos are awesome.  Have been following since your first one about the LN.  Looks like you've changed them up a bit since then and the original isn't there anymore.
"https://twitter.com/Ripple/status/949131179797626880

financial institutions are going to be using ripple this year.

surprisingly as well its because they were using bitcoin but bitcoin became so slow and unusable some are moving to ripple sooner.

so i guess thanks guys for doing in bitcoin!"
"This video was made by people who hold majority btc or eth and are worried

"Great video Ripple was known to be garbage by many but then 2014 happened and everyone got hypnotized and distracted to the point where most top ""cryptocurrencies"" these days aren't mined or decentralized in any meaningful way.

"Ripple is a funding scheme to help make me money.

i am laughing all the way to the Bank. 
Sadly, Blockstream is trying to do the same thing with BTC that people think XRP is being used for.

Ripple holding 60% of xrp means is in their best interest to increase xrp’s value.  55 billion xrp has already been locked up, with one billion released a month for sale to banks and institutions. 
Fidget spinner shit coin
Crazy how all these articles pop as soon as Ripple gets ahead of Bitcoin Cash. I saw zero before then
I just sold all of my XRP, thanks!
"Whomever made this video completely misunderstands the concept of ripple and xrp. The concept has always been a 1 for 1 amount trade for dollar not Bitcoin . Think of it as viewed from the dollar side entering the crypto world. When ripple was made Bitcoin was mined and going for $70 bucks. XRP wanted to be the safe portion to send and receive BTC between banks. At that time there was only Bitcoin and Litecoin. Ripple/XRP is old... been around longer then other coins.
 
The video is right on two parts which is liquidity and Banks. When investment banks such as JPmorgan started bonding BTC they needed a way to securely move into the crypto currency world and the SEC banned them from certain trading parts of because of the BTC. Now investing houses can reach into crypto with a safety net. If JPmorgan or any other investment group need liquidity it will come from the amount locked up, and when you need to move multiple transactions you will need that liquidity. Right now you are doing one token/coin a transaction... investors need multiple options per token/investor. You want that USD $20,000 value BTC but how are you going to keep that value unless there is a easy way for investors to get in like xrp? see you don't get it.

Premined, when ripple was first created it followed a trend as other ICO at that time of being premined there were several coming out at 2012 that were premined and ripple/xrp has seemed to last.

If you take a step back and see that the investors and founders of ripple have even stated that BTC is like gold and is like the ultimate scale in crypto world then you can understand that they just want xrp/ripple to be another player on the field and not a one stop solution, they pretty much say that. They are both invested in Bitcoin and XRP personally. They want xrp and ripple to be liquidity to move other crypto. When it is time for you to cash our on another coin and by that lambo they want to be the middle man to quickly offer banks a solution to handle your crypto problem.

Oh the reason for the wallet activation is to prevent bots, people from manipulating the market. You would have to invest so much to open multiple wallets to try to manipulating the xrp blockchain.

As far as Chuck e cheese token, being a long time miner around 2010 I remember the News calling bitcoin chuck e cheese tokens... oh the irony. Bitcoin miners always disliked xrp as it was fundamentally different and nobody understood why. lucky I was gifted with thousands myself as will as mining my own bitcoin. I see a equal playing field, not a scam and not something that will threaten the crypto world.  Chillax bro.
  
Sorry for the typos my iMac is taking over my words typed.
 

in fact I found a video with ripple reps (Ripple, GBTC and Circle roundtable) in concern of half of what this video speaks of https://www.credit-suisse.com/pwp/ws/videobroadcast/?pid=9ceVakBGCElMdKCKL5I4T6_prgxnKHap sit back and watch with your own eyes what ripple and investors want out of bitcoin and crypto."
"This sub:

"My feeling was always this:

If Ripple is an interbank settlment system, and XRP are bridge currency, then if XRP ever became too expensive, the banks could just create Ripple2 & XRP2 as a 2nd settlement network, and so on.

There might be a max supply for XRP in Ripple.  But there's nothing that blocks Ripple and the banks from creating & using multiple settlement networks."
"Ripple's main product doesn't involve its XRP token at all.

Onstage during the event, a number of banks using xCurrent asserted that they would not be using XRP anytime soon, contrary to what XRP investors might be banking on today.

https://www.coindesk.com/100-billion-controversy-xrps-surge-raises-hard-questions-ripple/  

It certainly seems like XRP is some optional useless token, and just a way for Ripple to collect free money from the crypto-crazed crowd."

For a long time I would think maybe I should get some Ripple assuming they would do something to bitcoin and all the others leaving Ripple alone. But, I was not aware till recently that Ripple was not XRP. Also, I don't like the lack of wallet (granted you can get one), but it is just not the same.

Why do we need litecoin and bitcoin and bitcoin cash when we have XRP? XRP is much faster and cheaper. I'm just asking. Obvioulsy, if Bitcoin Cash developed privacy and other functions (e.g., color codes) it could be complementary to XRP

Actually funny! Ripple is Slinderman!
"I think you'll find if you step back and take a closer look. 95% of cryptos are cash grab scams designed to enrich the creators with YOUR money. This is a fact. 

XRP isn't colluding with any banks. Ripple is using this crypto rush as a chance to acquire billions in crowd funding for nothing, to make a real product for real banks. That's it.  "
What did I say is false?
That doesn't make sense.
"I wouldn't say ""love"", but I can seen a place and use cases for each one of those. 

Love, hate... Those are things one shouldn't bring to discussions about blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Would say that we probably won't have any ""one crypto to rule them all"", but rather interconnected networks working in tandem doing what each does best, for the benefit of all of us."
Uhm, Ripple was started in 2004.
"Banks hold a variety of currencies, including US dollar, Yen, Euro, etc.  

Even if XRP is one of the currencies they're holding, it would NOT be in the banks overall interest for the price of XRP to rise, since it would reduce the relative value of the other currencies they're holding (since they need to swap in & out of XRP the bridge currency)

If anything, the banks would want a bridge currency with a stable price.  And that isn't going to be a publicly traded cryptocurrency like XRP, which can fluctuate wildly based on McAfee tweets and crazy day traders.

It wouldn't surprise me if Ripple later releases a stable token that is USD-pegged (or pegged to a basket of currencies) that banks can use as a stable bridge currency."
"If you were holding xrp's valued n billion, why would you not try to make the value grow? Why would you just dump it to have money to develop products?

"
I don’t see how dumping the price creates this “free money” you speak of 
That is like Ripple betting on people not being greedy and continuing to buy XRP. Companies will do whatever keeps them most profitable with the least amount of work. I don’t see anything as easy as them just keeping XRP around for the public to continue to buy in and make Ripple into a multi trillion dollar company. Same reason why stock market still exists. You don’t see corporations running off with their shareholders’ money overnight because it’s worth billions. 
Why would an investor even care if they’re just in it to make money? There won’t be a difference in the pricr of the XRP that Ripple holds vs what the public holds in XRP so people who are investing are still going to continue to benefit as long as Ripple continues to drive up the value of their XRP coin. 
">WHy?

Well a corporate coin.. should I say more?"
Oh, and the user has infinitelly less control.
Shill
Central control of governance and trusted validator nodes ensure a trust based system [link](https://ripple.com/dev-blog/decentralization-strategy-update/) If Ripple controls the nodes and are theoretically capable of denying specific transactions, what is the difference to traditional Fiat system we are currently entertaining?

If you keep it on an exchange and never deposit into a private wallet, the 20 XRP minimum doesn’t apply. So you can really sell all. 
"> Why create a Ripple 2 and XRP2? 

Why create Windows XP > Windows 7 > Windows 10?

Why have the users communicate with MSN Messenger > Windows Live Messenger > Skype?

But the big benefit of Ripple2 & XRP2 is to collect more money.

After Ripple & founders have sold off all their XRP, their free money gravy train is over.

So at that point, it makes sense to create Ripple2 & XRP2, and collect more free money from the daytraders.

There is absolutely nothing stopping Ripple from issuing XRP2, XRP3, XRP4, etc to collect more free money.
"
"No one actually uses XRP for anything. Virtually zero active addresses

https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/activeaddresses-btc-xrp-eth-bch-ltc.html#3m"
"Except that Ripple is one company, one installed platform, with a captive audience.

Let's say that 100% of banks sign up for Ripple's interbank settlement system, and let's say the banks decide to use the optional token XRP.

Over time, Ripple Labs can easily upgrade the software, to include Ripple2 & XRP2, etc.  

It's like how bank employees used Windows 95 >> Windows XP >> Windows 7 >> Windows 10.  

And with those upgrades, they might have used MSN Messenger >> Windows Live Messenger >> Skype, which were included with each OS upgrade.

When you say ""Bitcoin Cash did exactly that to Bitcoin Core"", that's a different case.  Whenever there is a new fork (Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Diamond), retail nodes like Coinbase, Bitpay, Coinify, Exodus wallet don't automatically support it.  They evaluate it like a new cryptocurrency.  People like Roger Ver have to convince the various companies to adopt BCH.

"This is not true

The inter banking ripple system **does not use** the XRP you and I can buy

How many more times does this need to be said for people to get it through their thick skulls?"
Exactly, the higher the price of XRP, the better for banks, companies and payment providers.
And Ripple doesn’t keep anything. Your Toast wallet activates with a 20 XRP minimum. You need to do more research before commenting on any of this. 
Blind sided from their own vested interest
"> Any coin where a team owns more than either 20% (and that's already pushing it, some coins are fully dispersed) of the total supply and/or 50% of the voting weight (that includes miners) is an outright scam.

And those numbers come from where exactly? In real world the original inventors of a product or the original owners of a company often keep 51% of the company they own and it’s assets to remain in control of it and be sure they can keep it on track with their vision. By your standard there would be a lot of scams out there if you only keep this criteria to define what is a scam.

My definition has more to do with being dishonest and knowingly stealing people’s money, but I won’t convince you Ripple is not stealing my money, right? 

In your calculation, can you tell me what is the percentage of XRP the ripple team owns? You do realize the coins in possession of Ripple the company does not belong to the team, right?

Do you think all the Bitcoin core developers together own more than 20% of all the Bitcoins in circulation? Satoshi owns more than 6% of circulating supply all by itself, I hope the other devs don’t hold too much... How did you calculate the total owned by the Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash « team » of developers and it’s miners? Or are you telling me Bitcoin is a scam too?

>> Do you really think you have any kind of protection or that any of those people in power owes you anything?!  


>>>That's exactly my point. Thanks for finally catching on.  

Wow, did you really take my sentence out of context just like that to make your point? 😂 How pathetic is that! Here is the context of who I was talking about (in the sentence right before your quote): 
>> Do you even realize you are being manipulated by a few people already (the big miners, the core developers, the exchange owners, etc.).

I wasn’t talking about Ripple at all! haha! I can’t believe it, what a joke!

>>the exchange owners (big holders) have insider knowledge nothing stops them to dump their holdings before the rest of the world.  


>People who keep their coins on these exchanges are just as naive as those who bought XRP.  

Oh please! Again? Are you really taking another quote out of it’s context and even trunking the rest of the sentence to make it seem like a whole other meaning and make your point? Pathetic!!! Please stop that. And what does your answer has to do with this conversation?! Just another occasion to bitch? Come on, grow up! Here is my original sentence and context: 

>>Again, XRP is just like any other crypto out there, if the other crypto’s developers, the miners, the exchange owners (big holders) have insider knowledge nothing stops them to dump their holdings before the rest of the world. Again, what’s your point? What’s the difference?

See? Not the same meaning is it?


>Shareholders will be informed as per the law or the team commits insider trading fraud. XRP holders are not shareholders and don't have this protection. They can and will be the first to receive a fresh dump on their holdings if the company needs the funds to stay afloat. 

Does it even make sense? If the shareholders behind the company can’t dump before anyone else, who will? If XRP holders don’t have insider information, what is the problem?! Or you are telling me the shareholders will inform the XRP holders? Isn’t this insider trading also? Why would the company dump it’s XRP on the market, therefore lowering the price of it and their own profit? Do you really think they have to dump large amounts of their reserves to stay afloat? I’m pretty sure they are doing great with what they are regularly selling.

Have a good one! "
No, the video is pretty sound.  There's only one point I think is debatable (how easily can Ripple make new XRP?).  But, please, enlighten us.
Crowds like this will blindly say 'banks won't use xrp' even when their own banks are using it. If you're philosophically opposed to xrp then fine but I hate the blind denial.
Boys... the downvotes are coming 
"Because it's a horrible scam. It's worse than Bitcoin Gold or Bitcoin Diamond or Bitcoin God or whatever. At least in case of those coins you get non-controlled tokens which are supposed to be in use. Just won't be because of premines.

In Ripple you have premine AND completely useless token which can be withdrawn or released on a whim of a private corporation.

Ripple is no better than Webmoney, Perfect Money, Liberty Dollars or EGold. It's even worse than Paypal [because XRP tokens have virtually no reason behind them](https://np.reddit.com/r/Ripple/comments/6mczyn/actually_using_ripple_why_so_few_xrp_merchants/).

I seriously want to petition all the marketcap places to remove Ripple because it has nothing to do with CryptoCurrency.

We should either accept all other old school money like WebMoney (heavy cryptography usage, tokens are pegged but they have internal market as well), Perfect Money (centralized web based processing), Paypal and other shit nature throws at us...

**XRP - Ripple is basically a free company donation token with no cryptographic algorithm propping it!**

The only difference from any other donation is that you can trade it afterwards on exchanges."

Does season 3 contain anything that potentially moves the show more to the right? Like statements about financial freedom rather than erasing debt?

So funny because that show actually shows so much reality in it.
They are!
"No, I wouldn't say so. And rather than being about erasing debt, I think it's about taking down the conglomerate Ecorp, which is painted as an evil entity that has gained too much control over people's lives (and a 'debt jubilee' would be just one of the positives coming from their fall).

There is only one mention of communism. In the very last episode (no spoilers), there is a random non-important character who says to Darlene:

>""That's not the way this crony capitalism works. Shit, educate yourself on some Marx before you go just theorizing about economic forces."" (no, I didn't have this memorized, opened the subtitle file to see the exact wording, lol)

I thought it was funny she was talking about the economy and Marx in the same sentence, but this was the only mention of communism and Darlene's response does not indicate that she agrees or disagrees with her either way. I think you are right that it was written to be vague enough to capture people who hold various beliefs. Perhaps we get a clearer view down the road."

"Again me:

> You said they (newspapers) 

And you:

> **I equated** mainstream media with newspapers.

This is not the same. But I see some further explanation is in order.

By newspapers I meant literal newspapers, like made out of paper.

And yes, the medium (paper) **will** become irrelevant. But the companies that used paper just moved on to the next medium.

.

The same with Bitcoin. Banks will be made irrelevant because the medium that is being used for purchases (fiat money) will become irrelevant. They will have to use Bitcoin.

And Internet liberated the society, making it possible(and much easier than before) for a single man (like Snowden, Assange) to change entire world.

The same with Bitcoin. Bitcoin will liberate the society from banks, even if the banks will keep existing. They will just lose dominance.

Of course, old empires will fall, new empires will be built and new machine of terror & propaganda will be created again in some time. History usually circles like this.

But the society progresses anyway and people are now richer and healthier and less likely to die in a war or assault that ever before in mankind's history. But all of this will be nothing compared to the progress we can make when Joe Sixpack is freed from the banking cartel.

Now we are going sub-light speeds. After Bitcoin(Cash) is the dominant currency, we will go into hyperspeed mode."

"How is that different to most people making money on BTC, BCH or any other crypto? Regardless if they serve a purpose, the people getting in before a run for the stars make money, the mainstreamers getting in late lose money. A huge part of the valuation of Core and Cash are based on speculation on exchanges anyway.

Not saying you are wrong, just that it is not unique to Ripple."
No kidding, but thankfully, reality has a liberal bias.
"Well they don't explicitly state the political views of the characters (at least not the 2 main characters), so I suppose I am kinda making a bit of a leap...

The main characters are against the monopoly Ecorp has over several markets and to me, this is an indication that they are against crony capitalism as monopolies are protected by regulation. It is undoubtedly true that they are against the pre-existing system, which is crony capitalism AKA corporatism - it just isn't clear exactly what they believe is the optimal political system.

If it really is about anti-capitalism, I would be thoroughly disappointed. Maybe my free-market views are clouding my judgment... lol :/"
I really hope so, the power of stupid is strong.
I agree that it is watchable (or if it isn't it is not because of political affiliation)

"Agree. First season was a **MASTER PIECE**. Second season was a self indulgent guitar solo that went waaaay to long. Third season reeled it back in but still not up to the level of season 1.  Esmail has sold out some trying to stretch a three storline show into a 5-6 season storyline. 

The Alexa advertising integration in the third season is soooooooo ironic in the third season I can hardly stomach it.  And the fact that the whole franchise is owned by Comcast (Evil Corp.), boggles the mind. 

Hopefully this kind of thing can be financed by SingularDTV in the future. "

">Federal Reserve which is not a government entity

Horseshit.

>The Federal Reserve System is composed of several layers. It is governed by the presidentially appointed Board of Governors or Federal Reserve Board (FRB). Twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks, located in cities throughout the nation, oversee the privately owned U.S. member banks. 

Let's see what other system is controlled by presidential appointments? Oh right most of them including and not limited to the FCC, the National Security Advisor, Secretary of Agriculture... and in a way even the Supreme Court is controlled by presidential appointments.

Unless you're implying the Supreme Court isn't a government entity?

The Fed is absolutely a government entity. Does it have little to no oversight? Yes. Should it have congressional oversight? I think as finance is the purview of Congress it absolutely should... But that's not something that renders it invalid as a Government Entity.

It was made by the government to be a tool of the government."

Here's a coin which can bring together Bitcoin and BitcoinCash... Fuck Ripple. Centralization is the #1 Enemy.
Meh. It's alright. But way too outlandish with poor acting. It tries too hard at times. S1 was great and a few episodes in S3
Can anyone confirm if season 2 onward is actually good?

Nope, you’re exactly right. It’s not competing with BTC at all other than on Coinmarketcap. People are just feeling threatened because Ripple is now more than half the market cap of BTC. That’s all.
Guy on the right is Ben Bernanke, former chair of the Federal Reserve which is not a government entity, but a privately owned bank which is in control of all USD printing. I don't know the other guy, probably XRP ceo or something.

"Artificial monopoly on money. No competition, no innovations, bad risk managmenet by socializing risks - inefficient money which corrupts the whole economy

Currently exists everywhere. Will transition to sound digital moeny will be smooth? **No**. Millions will likely die due to destruction of wealth redistribution by taxation and breakdowns of supply chains, first and foremost - food in the biggest cities"
It's fine if there is competition to keep it in line but generally speaking it's 1 entity that controls the main aspects of monetary policy... interests rates and circulating supply, bank regulations. But a centralized crypto means 1 entity controls consensus. Meaning, it's ledger can be altered without anyone to reject it... It's pointless. The real negative thing about ripple is that it facilitates the creation of IOUs that are spendable, loanable and are meant to be valued the same as the underlying asset, whether it be XRP or a gold bar or dollars. This is what banks do today..

"Sorry, I meant to say Ripple has working products which XRP is integral to. If you think XRP has no links whatsoever you need to do more research my friend. 

This article is a confusing mishmash of misinformation and criticisms that don't necessarily pan out well. There are ""industry insiders"" on both sides, not just ones levying critiques, and the focus on terminology based on leaderships is a convoluted argument that really doesn't amount to anything. There are valid concerns here, but when you compare Ripple and XRP to most other coins, they're already lightyears ahead. Whether banks utilize XRP or not, it's a well managed, efficient asset that has a lot of qualities people like.  "
Have you actually watched it?
You're commenting on a post that's criticizing a coin for being too establishment on a subreddit that promotes a form of anti-establishment currency designed to take control of the market from the corporations and give it to the people.....
As majority of people are. What to be surprised of?
This is interpretation is quite a stretch. They literally wanted to destroy banks and erase people's loans. Not because corporations pay corrupt politicians for laws or something but simply because they thought it was wrong to be in debt to the rich. Now to be honest I haven't seen season 3 yet and there are some things in the show that point to the fact that the character's idea of the revolution was flawed and could not work (the theme of season 2)
"heavens!

fear ye the loathsome egalitarians."
"I don't quite agree with that. It certainly does lean a bit ""left"" and the (main)  characters are definitely that way but the show itself is fairly even handed and certainly very watchable whatever your political affiliation."
I disagree. Just because it is against the current system doesn't make it leftist. The way I see it, Mr. Robot is about rebelling against corporatism, not free-market capitalism.
"> XRP cannot be frozen by Ripple. Period. Bitstamp froze Jed’s funds on their service.

ripple told/asked with pretty please bitstamp to do that.  Just because there is one point of control that may be somewhat decentralized, powerful and/or centralized forces can influence that point of control."
Well that may be true I'm just leery of anybody's ability to freeze wallets for any reason doesn't sound like a good idea to me.
Ripple anyone? 
No I'm not that good of a writer
"I'm not talking about the board of governors. 

>""The Federal Reserve Banks have an intermediate legal status, with some features of private corporations and some features of public federal agencies. The United States has an interest in the Federal Reserve Banks as tax-exempt federally created instrumentalities whose profits belong to the federal government, but this interest is not proprietary.[73] In Lewis v. United States,[74] the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit stated that: ""The Reserve Banks are not federal instrumentalities for purposes of the FTCA [the Federal Tort Claims Act], but are independent, privately owned and locally controlled corporations."" The opinion went on to say, however, that: ""The Reserve Banks have properly been held to be federal instrumentalities for some purposes."" Another relevant decision is Scott v. Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City,[73] in which the distinction is made between Federal Reserve Banks, which are federally created instrumentalities, and the Board of Governors, which is a federal agency.""

Yes, but I think it's back up now

"The problem lies in your first sentence - You have this coin effectively cut in half in two separate projects - Bitcoin is widely adopted but can't actually be used as any sort of Internet fiat replacement due to the high fees, and BCH alleviates this but lacks the wide adoption.

I'd agree with you a year ago, but right now Bitcoin cannot be used widely for anything other than larger transactions, and a lot of big companies that did use it have discontinued it (such as Steam). You have fanboism wishing Amazon will accept it without looking at the fact that micro-transactions cost $20 each. There is just a vast disconnect with reality in Bitcoin core supporters. 

There are a lot of good coins that will eclipse Ethereum soon where it failed to be a Bitcoin replacement - EOS, NEO and Cardano are just a few. Even projects like Waves I believe will have a good shot.

As long as Bitcoin core continues to rest on its laurels and fails to immediately address its issues whilst its bubble and fanboism continually increases, it is doomed to be eclipsed by 3rd gen coins. Investors are tired of not knowing which is the ""real bitcoin"", and soon it might not even matter."

"> Like a dream being crushed

Now you know how I(we - /r/btc) feel. Not only did they crush our dreams, they exiled us for disagreeing not agreeing with the narrative, and for embracing the whitepaper written by bitcoin's creator.

Luckily, on August 1st 2017, Bitcoin Cash we (re)born. Those who do not call the whitepaper a relic or a 'living document' again have the OG bitcoin to believe in. It is truly beautiful.

> It seems shortsighted to think a company would be able singlehandedly outsmart several million people now that we have the internet.

Edit: 

> Edit2: I also dislike how the video assumes no other scalability solution other than sidechains and lightning will ever be implemented. 

You may be missing the point tho. Blockstream REFUSES to up the block limit and have severely crippled the chain, spawning bitcoin cash. This is no ones fault but their own. THey continuously lied, for years. They lied to everyone. The community, the miners, and the devs. They fucking removed the commit keys from the dude who worked alongside Satoshi and then did nothing but talk shit about him.

It goes on and on, and on.

Edit2: I would recommend you read [THIS](https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/6rxw7k/informative_btc_vs_bch_articles/dl8v4lp/). Get ready to have your mind blown.

The banks will stop at nothing. Ripple is their new play."
"You can definitely use bitcoin cash. And it has all the surrounding infrastructure (exchanges, merchant gateways etc) that for example ETH lacks (but is the closest contender, which is why my portfolio is 75% BCH/ETH rest alts).

Try installing bitcoin.com's wallet on two devices and do some transactions between them. It's refreshning to see things actually work in this space.

I've been trying to send ETH and tokens this whole evening, but mew keeps timing my transactions out because the TX pool is full or whatever..

BTC / Bitcoin core is dead to me, totally useless. Anyone using it is a moron, why would you? It has absolutely no usage / value anymore except the ""perception"" of value."
For as long as they continue to attack Bitcoin, we will continue to defend it. Core and company must not be allowed to get away with the shit they've been pulling.
"You couldn't have chosen a worse example. FIAT is not responsible for your poor decision of pursuing a $50k liberal arts degree or a mortgage that will take you 30 years to repay. You chose that, the banks were only there to allow you to make that decision. Debt slavery is a choice. 

At least mention the evils of fiat market cap manipulation if you want to compare it to crimes against humanity, or corrupt fractional reserving or lack of transparency or literally anything except debt slavery which is entirely the fault of the individual.

"
"> Banks are extensions of central banks

Not correct. Banking worked fine prior to central banking and will work fine after central banking is gone"
I agree entirely that BCH is useful, and I use it too for transfers between exchanges. The problem is it hasn't got the brand recognition of the BTC dinosaur. Until then it's just another cryptocurrency.
LN does not require centralized hubs, but with high on chain transaction fees that is absolutely what will happen.

Which part? The not requiring central hubs (because you can certainly open a channel with one other person without it being a hub) or that it will gravitate towards that with high fees?

"Not true.

Ripple can't overtake Bitcoin cos it's not an open blockchain. Or u can say that USD overtook Bitcoin. It makes no sense
"While I agree that brand recognition is important, I think that ""technology"" recognition also is. If you have convinced someone to use crypto (bitcoin core) once, and then you tell them ""hi, we fucked up the entire thing, sorry you need to replace it with <another complicated system>"" they might just very well (depending on their success with bitcoin) up and leave.

If its ""hi, we just need you to implement the upgraded bitcoin called 'cash'"", things go much smoother. In the case of say, bitpay, its just ""enable the cash checkbox in your options and you're good to go""."
I just know that most of you guys don't know shit about banking and how little it actually affects you. You are obsessed aluminum foilheads.
"> You are all idiots with a strong sentiment against banks. 

Incorrect.

Banks are evil players with a strong sentiment against personal freedom.

Learn how today's banks work and how fractional reserve came into existence before you talk to me, because you just know nothing about anything. "

"Indeed. It wasn't from your reply though, it was from my quoting your reply. 

/u/rawb0t ? You should disallow tips that are preceded with > so that quoted tips don't initiate tips.

> For example u/tippr $0.01 (Keep it anyway.)

Edit: Should only be if > is at the start of the line."
If tippr actually sent you a message in response to mine, let’s loop in rawb0t. I know he has bounds checks here, but still might be worth polishing the messaging.
Thanks, you've been really great!
whoops haha grammar fail. 
Check edit.
The iota tip bot is actually working again. 
"Well, the BCH is in rawb0t's wallet but the security is in the hands of Reddit.

Technically, u/spez or any admin with sufficient privileges could make tippr send funds wherever they wanted. And there is precedent to editing user posts. It seems unlikely and tippr is still a great service but bear it in mind."
"yeah mate the period at the end breaks it. 

also stick the tip in front of the mention instead of behind. i plan to phase out that old syntax"
"Oh, haha. I read that as ""No thank you"" rather than ""No. Thank *you*"".

Thought you come up with a new feature for tippr where people can just say ""no thank you"" and deny the tip. :)"
Yes, please just keep laughing. We’re all just having a good laugh! Dum-de-dum...
It’s a joke (not real), just like the IOTA tip bot 😆
Good news. You can load small amount because the fees don't force you to do large transactions to make them worthwhile.
I don’t think the BCH is really “on” reddit. It’s probably the same place as wherever the code that runs tippr is.

"nice stuff dude, i like it i really do. 

But i have to say i really like reddit, but what i do not like is the staff, incompetent bunch of agenda pushing minions. I let the dust settle first, just to risky for me now to load $100 to an unsafe plattform. "
Too late. Local engineer dropped support. Adam warned us! Use Bitcoin (Cash)
Is this real???
">u/tippr -1 BCH -justification revenge

LOL?

Edit: Context of what I was laughing (and questioning)

Edit2: Got this in my PM's 

>Something went wrong with your tip. Please check your balance and try again. If the problem persists, please contact u/rawb0t "
Their censorship knows knows bounds

This thread is beautiful. So much giving
Welcome back! I remember seeing this ages ago. I'll tip ya a few bucks when I finally buy-in. :)

"This appears to be Mailgun's disclosure:  http://blog.mailgun.com/mailgun-security-incident-and-important-customer-information/

There's not much there.  However, this might explain a number of Reddit account hacks beyond the scope of the Tippr incident.  Someone had access to every single password reset email sent by Reddit."
"all glory to /u/rawb0t

/u/tippr 128 bits"
Glad it's back! Do you know if any other of the bots were affected? I tried getting to the creators by tagging them in the original hack thread on r/tippr but didn't get any response :/
Does this mean we can withdraw now?
/u/tippr $1.00
u/tippr $1 whoo
Hurray! /u/tippr $0.50
"u/tabbr -1000 bch

Edit: Damn, I guess it doesn't work anymore.

Screw it, u/tippr $1"
"Great :)

I think some of the suggestions were good.
We can't keep relying on reddit, maybe adding some kind of address linking?

Link for the first time a withdrawal address and if you want to change you'd need to sign a message with the new withdrawal.

It's cumbersome for users, so maybe making it optional, so that high tip worth users can enable it.

Thanks for the great work.

/u/tippr 0.5 usd"
Nice, /u/tippr 300 bits
Woohoo! Thanks for managing this well. /u/tippr 210 bits
Thank you! 5000 bits /u/tippr
"u/rawb0t, you've received `1 BCH ($2574.31 USD)`!

Just kidding, keep up the great work!

/u/tippr $5

Also I lol'd a little: https://i.imgur.com/GWPWR9F.png"

What is going on here? I must have missed something.
"Yay!

"
"YAAAAASSS 

thanks man! 
"
"Awesome! Should we close out our tabs now? ;)"
Ive never been tipped or have tipped anybody and I was worried about not being able to after that fiasco. Cheers!
How does it work? I see this bot all the time but no idea how it tips
Excellent news, I hope mailgun and Reddit put some effort into tracking the individual who did this.
Good work, tabbr wasn't cutting it for me.
great thats what differs this sub fro nmthe other - peopel here actually tip others for fun not just speak of their greed 
Hooray! 
"Thank you very much for returning Tippr to Reddit! Have a special generous tip from me, u/rawb0t!

"That perfectly shows how outdated e-mail is really are. Open blockchains will solve both money and communication

**Trustless** systems are the future"
So that’s why I haven’t been seeing any tips! Glad it’s fixed!
