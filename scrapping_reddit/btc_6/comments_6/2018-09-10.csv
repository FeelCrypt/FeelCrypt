">The market doesn't give you the subjective value, but does give the objective market value. 

That's what I said. Just look at what I wrote above. 

Long as you understand that market value in this case does not mean that the product itself is necessarily superior compared to other products. 

If this was necessarily so, then scams like pump and dumps would have to be inherently worth more than many non-scams. This is obviously not the case.

>Why would BCH be objectively more valuable on the market, but still is 1/13th of the price of BTC?

You mean, why would it be _objectively utilized and speculated on in such a way that it has a higher money price to anyone or on average than it currently does._ Again, the current price does not fully translate to more or less efficiency in the actual product being produced in any individual case. It only means that the product fits into the market place via price.

There can be many reasons for price and in this case I think 1/13th or whatever it is currently, is due both to the much lower hashrate but also due to an under estimation and mis-pricing made individually by those speculating on its future price.

It's important to notice the distinction here. Goods can be mis-priced by individuals based on certain value criteria such as ethics or the availability of resources, but not mis-priced in terms where its money price currently fits into the picture in the grander economic system. We're talking about different areas of evaluation.

For an example of this, see Austrian business cycle theory which discusses mis-priced commodities in relation to others, which are misleading those engaged in the economy but obviously not ""wrongly priced"" in that economic full birds eye view itself since money prices are merely the result of economic necessity."
The market doesn't give you the subjective value, but does give the objective market value. Why would BCH be objectively more valuable on the market, but still is 1/13th of the price of BTC?
Agreement on price is why we have a market price.
The market facilitates agreement out of differing cost perception and priorities. Therefore, disagreement precedes agreement. 
keep doing what you do, don't stop, because nobody cares
Disagree? I have yet to see any counter arguments to the points I made here. 
what he said.
It doesn’t sound unreasonable, I guess I haven’t seen a lot of direct evidence supporting it.
Mine was a joke too, I thought it was obvious
"You  have no idea what you're talking about.


Bitcoiners were joking about ""hookers & blow"", and actually paying for real hookers & blow, at a very early time. And the furry fandom is a fandom like any other; and like any other big fandom there are some people interested in rule 34 and some that are not; but more importantly, furries aren't about real animals, they're not about animals at all except in the sense of ""humans are animals""; the definition of a furry fan (usually shortened to ""furry"", like how a Star Trek fan is a ""trekkie"") is someone interested in art about, or otherwise related to, anthropozoomorphic characters (often misleadingly described as ""anthropomorphic animals"", but also shortened to ""anthros""), that is, characters which have characteristics of both human and animals; the classic archetype being a general human body plan but covered in fur instead of human skin, with a tail, and with hands, head, and feet somewhere in-between human and animal in shape, but still, in the skull is still a mostly human mind, that is still a person not a beast, and even for something like for example My Little Pony characters, they still have mostly human minds, regardless of their lack of human body proportions, so still persons and not beasts;  even if the fandom was strictly focused on rule 34, furries would not be any more into beastiality than someone that would like to fuck  T'Pol; anthros are, first, fictional (that means not real), and second, they're human-like in their intellect, so non-real non-animals."
Those emails had not been evidence of censorship.
"All of crypto right now


Wake up people"
"I suggest others not invest in a single asset class. I will remain wealthy even if BTC goes to 1 penny , so no need to worry about me. 

Good idea to invest in land, homes , businesses with cash flow, SP500 index funds like a SPDR, along with BTC and have no debts.

In fact one should not even **invest** in BTC(If you need to use it as p2p currency than go ahead) in the first place unless they have a fiat emergency fund and payed off all your high interest debts. 3-12 months minimum of fiat savings of living expenses is recommended 
"
"""I don't even need to convince them. I can just drop the suggestion."""
"That's a joke; I guess you have not been around very long."
Market also says IOTA is worth billions. And market also said for 3 years that Bitcoin will never amount to anything. Markets are like AI. They are awesomely accurate...but only after a learning period. 
The market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.
"But you reacted to someone saying 'Market is king, and the market prefers Bitcoin over BCH'. 
I know what you are trying to say, but you go very deep into the theories just to prove that the subjective pricing is relevant too sometimes and that commodities can be mis-priced. That is a very weak argument to someone saying the market prefers Bitcoin. Even more so if it prefers something 13 times more. 

If BCH was more valuable to the market right now, the price would be higher, because more people would have wanted BCH for over a year now. The reality is that this is not the case, at least not right now. "
Yep. I actually am more inclined to see the small blocker community vs big blocker as an ideological divide. Communists versus Libertarians.
Manipulation and playing with peoples feelings works better in the long run.
"> Yes btc is on a massive down low right now but it will come back soon enough Im sure.

Usually ""Store Of Value"" slumps down like remaining 10% of ""value"" left. Pump and Dump."
Haha, what the fuck..
"The guy is a known troll around here and uses market price as a form of argument from authority. That's the only reason I would go this far to disprove him and counter some of his encouragement of further trolling.

Yes, the price of BTC is much higher and so is the hashrate. As already said, this has many reason. But of course one is that most do not consider BCH serious competition to BTC. 

I'm not arguing anyone should be speculating one way or the other. Just pointing out that sometimes what matters is the unseen, rather than the seen."
