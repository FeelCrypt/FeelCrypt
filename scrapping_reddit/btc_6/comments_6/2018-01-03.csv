1. Spam is not money. Spam is just a very mild type of denial-of-service attack. Nobody will mind filtering it.
2. Each node operator is free to accept or reject transactions as they see fit. Nobody is obliged to relay spam, whether or not it is a form of money. In fact a node operator could accept and relay only spam, and reject all non-spam, and that would not violate the consensus rules.  In fact anybody wanting to send spam would do exactly this -- run a full node that sends only spam and discards all non-spam. This spam would, of course, be filtered out by other nodes, so it would do no harm."
In a way, our interaction symbolizes the difference between /r/btc and /r/Bitcoin. Discussion leading to general consensus vs. immediate ban.
Larger blocks also mean fewer people can validate independently, which means centralization.
Centralization is when you cannot mine on the BTC chain because if you don't earn more than 30 USD a month, you cabnot pay the transaction of your own fees.
"I think that ""spam filtering"" is against the vision of ""censor-free money"", the only good way to combat spam is to have a fee-level high enough to make it unattractive to spam.  (possible exception, the old ""priority queue""-algorithm in Bitcoin may have been a good idea).

Spam seems to be mostly a theoretical problem (with one notable exception - the smallblockers are probably right when they claim someone has been deliberately filling the mempool with junk transactions from time to time just to ""prove a point"").

If it would be completely for free to send transactions, there is nothing preventing people from using the block chain as backup storage.  The fact that this apparently hasn't been a problem so far does not prevent it from becoming a problem in the future.  A recommended minimum fee of 1 satoshi pr byte (as is the current practice in Bitcoin Cash) makes real transactions dirt cheap while it's still very expensive to use the block chain as a general data storage, so it seems like a good balance."

Thats all.  it is no threat to any other coin.  it really shouldnt even ever be mentioned alongside BTC or any other, as they have basically nothing in common at all."

This is true in a legal sense, but not a mathematical sense. The FED's ability in this regard is limited to what will cause total systemic collapse, possibly accompanied by revolution, or at the very least a complete deterioration of the current economy.

But a good parasite avoids killing the host, and the seiniorage is carefully levied to the ebb and flow of political scapegoatism for the requited misdirection.

Whether this tends toward equilibrium or leads to eventual chaotic disruption largely depends upon for how long and in what proportion the populace remains ignorant of these manipulations."

"If there are better alternative then Bitcoin I will switch to whatever works best for what I want. Satoshi invented the engine and his first engine was a steam engine, then people build a gas engine and a diesel engine ... etc etc.

Bitcoin is just another word for digital currency as bit refers to digital and coin to currency. Every crypto is bitcoin.  Or rather bitcoin is just the name of the first crypto application and so it's better to just use the more generic term: Crypto currency or crypto for short.

I want to use crypto, I don't care what the name is. For now Bitcoin Cash and Ethereum offer me what I need. It's like email, does it really matter what email client you use? Or what email server program you use? No you want to use email! "
Look again.  This is a story about Bitcoin cash - the true bitcoin - which has miniscule fees, low confirmation times and which is increasingly used for commerce.
"Its not ""religious"". That piece of text defined bitcoin, what it is for and how it achieves it. If it doesnt fall into the given concept, then it isnt bitcoin.

Currently btc isnt ""decentralized"". And with every day its drifting further away from that. 

And since a code that drifts from the main blockchain idea is an altcoin, BTC is currently and Altcoin privately managed by a centralizing entity,  which clearly says in its name whats its purpose  (Block""stream"" - a limited, controlled , thin current of water). 

>Then why are you all trying to co-opt bitcoin name and say bcash is bitcoin?

I´m not co-opting anything. The whitepaper clearly states what is bitcoin. And any literate person can see that currently BTC isn´t it. 

It´s the same case of ""democracy"" and ""freedom"" for the US :)

>My biggest coinmplain against BCH is it's centralized and it's trying to steal bitcoin's brand recognition.

It goes with the original design tho (at least a lot more than the blockstream version). And it benefit a lot more people than the rich ones that don´t care about paying 100$ in fees and waiting a couple of days to get their crypto.

It’s like this:  if you knew what made a duck because it was defined:  “quacks, walks like a duck, has feathers, loves to swim, etc” and then you had a duck...  and you knew it was a duck because it matched the definition... Then that duck somehow got injected with weird DNA altering nanobots and it started changing and its webbed feet and wings turned into hooves, and it turned pink and grew a curly tail and started snorting, no longer liked swimming but instead loved wallowing in the mud..  you wouldn’t say “hey look at that pink duck!”  You’d have to admit that you now have a pig.  So....  bitcoin was a duck, it got injected with DNA altering nanobots and started turning into a pig, and the duck lovers said “no!!!”, cloned it and gave the clone another injection that killed the nanobots, and it turned back into a duck.  BTC stayed a pig (not matching the bitcoin description, therefore not bitcoin), and BCH is still the original duck (is bitcoin).

btg is premined.
"> It's not store of value. Nobody expects bcash to make them rich. 

Don't use terms you have no idea about. A store of value is something that has a stable price, doesn't do 30% swings on a day. It's obvious in the name, it stores value. Something that you buy to make you rich in no time is called a speculative asset. If this asset doesn't actually do what it promises like bitcoin core, than it becomes a ponzi scheme. "

Killing Bitcoin is impossible. Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin
"Since BTC no longer realize or follow the original whitepaper, it turned into an Alt Coin. BCH/BCC took its place as the original one now. 

The name doesnt matter, the code does.

And of course BCH is still manipulated by a party (miners), but at least they arent deviating from the original idea, just holding back the block size as long as possible. "
No. You have it wrong. We're celebrating bitcoin cash being 9 years old. 
You really have no idea what you are talking about do you?  The original developer of bitcoin is now on bitcoin cash (because it's the real bitcoin.)
For anybody who reads the above garbage, Gavin Andresen wrote the original bitcoin, and is now working on bitcoin cash.  _kiwiapple_ is a r/bitcoin troll who obviously has never actually read anything about bitcoin's history.

"**Gavin Andresen**

Gavin Andresen (born Gavin Bell) is an American software developer known for his involvement with Bitcoin. He is based in Amherst, Massachusetts.

Originally a developer of 3D graphics and virtual reality software, he became involved in developing products for the Bitcoin market in 2010, and declared himself the Lead Developer of the reference implementation for Bitcoin client software after Satoshi Nakamoto had announced his departure. In 2012 he founded the Bitcoin Foundation to support and nurture the development of the Bitcoin currency, and by 2014 left his software development role to concentrate on his work with the Foundation.

I tip people Bitcoin Cash here (hey /u/rawb0t when will the bot be back?) and I have people here in my local city that I send Bitcoin Cash as payment for services and goods (like computer related stuff). I also send Bitcoin Cash to my family to support them. And I send some to my friends to get them interested in Bitcoin Cash. Some have downloaded a client and gave me an address allowing me to cheaply and fast send them some Bitcoin Cash.

So yeah there are lots of people using Bitcoin for what it was intended. THis number will grow slowly and eventually when people see all the benefits that is has over using banks or paypal or visa cards you will see more and more growth untill the ecosystem is big enough that you never need fiat anymore because you can work and live within the bitcoin cash system. Or maybe there will be another crypto that does even better, then I will use that one.  Bitcoin is simply another name for crypto currency. Every crypto is made possible by the mechanisms that Sasothi invented. He invented the engine, but his first version was the steam engine. Now people will make gasoline engines or gas powered engines .. .etc etc etc.

"> The idea was abandoned, ironically, when Mr Paulson decided to follow Britain’s plan of injecting cash directly into troubled banks.

For those not familiar with the history, the [US Federal Reserve](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WALCL) still hasn't unwound the factor of 5 increase of their assets from that time.

The FED has an [EDIT nearly] unlimited ability to add to its assets.  As the central bank, most US banks have accounts at the FED, which are used to settle daily transactions between the banks, and where they can deposit excess funds and borrow for short periods of time when they need it.  The interest rate for borrowing from the FED is known as the ""Federal Funds Rate"", and is closely followed in the news.

When the FED wants to add to it's assets, it buys treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities from member banks and credits those bank's accounts at the FED to pay for it.  It now has more assets - the securities it bought, and more liabilities - the account balances of member banks.  So their books balance, but nobody can stop the FED from leveraging their net assets an unlimited amount.  Last time I looked, they were leveraged 200:1.

The effect on member banks is they now have more ""reserves"", since cash balances at the FED count as reserves.  Therefore they can lend more to customers, since they are required to keep a certain percentage reserve ratio.  It also increases the market value of the securities the FED bought, because it increased demand and reduced supply.  So the banks' books look healthier.

To the extent the FED bought mortgage-backed securities which were backed by crappy loans and over-valued real estate, it also cleaned up the member banks' books.  The FED can't go bankrupt, and can afford to be patient until those bad loans eventually are paid off by foreclosures and interest on the good loans.  Something like 5% of loans were [non-performing or written off](https://ezine.weissratings.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/874646.png) at the worst point, which means 95% were still paying.  But banks have to mark down the securities backed by those bad loans severely, making their assets vs liabilities look very bad.  The FED carries those securities at face value, regardless of the market for them, so their books look artificially good."
Actually there are more than two chains....how many are there?

How about we don't turn Bitcoin in to a religion and we don't start worship people? 
"If you use bitcoin as a currency and a way for making transactions then the market price will be a little less important then if you use bitcoin just to make money. Bitcoin itself can not be a bubble, the market price can but that is not as imporant as people think. If it crashes to 5 USD per bitcoin you can still buy some bitcoin to use those to pay for things with and make transactions. Miners will stop mining, diffuculty will go down, other miners will start mining again. Price will probablly eventually go up again. 

It just does not matter and once there is a eco system of enough people getting income in bitcoins and using it to pay for things then we have no business anymore with fiat. "

And that's worse than being on r/bitcoin who is owned by Theymos who uses censorship as a tool to push his agenda? 
"> Bobby Lee who is Chinese

Why always this focus on race/nationality? It just makes it seem like blockstream + brainwashed side are massive racists."
They do using shapeshift.  A couple of more steps, but support non the less
The fact that BCH won a 'Proof of Twitter' poll is very surprising and perhaps a bit revealing.
mmmm circlejerk
Educate bots?
Sounds to me like any other government...
Ugh, I don't like shapeshift. Have had only bad experiences :/ and that was before the situation was this bad.
Have we reached the Core shill exhaustion point?
"One of the more interesting aspects of Bitcoin is that you don't have to prove you are a non-terrorist human to use it.

If sentient AI becomes a thing, they will be able to get a ""job"", paid in Bitcoin (Cash)."
Uhh they don't support BCH yet right? I wouldn't recommend trying to buy anything with btc at the moment :P
"# You might want to check https://purse.io/investors

So basically you are on rbtc owned by Roger Ver who is the CEO of purse.io and Bobby Lee who is Chinese, you still don't get it ? Please tell me you do now."
"#Roger Ver is not a CEO of purse.io.

He's a CEO of Memory Dealers, a company that invested in purse.io.

Same for Bobby Lee."
Why even respond to someone like that? They're clearly not interested in reality. Still nice to see someone speaking up.
ROFL that's classic - I'm going to buy something through [Purse.io](https://purse.io) TODAY
many are probably the same miners.... they just switch back and forth to the most profitable in the moment...
Great find, what a laughing stock Blockstream are becoming xD
They hate the miners, but at the same time they all pay horrendous fees to them.
"Their majority shareholder is also the second (or third?) wealthiest man in China who is (was?) in charge of China's state bank investments. The link is Horizons Ventures, which is a VC firm that only invests the private funds of [Sir Li Ka-shing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Ka-shing). 

Like usual, the thing your opponent accused you the most of is usually what they're guilty of. "
"They want users to hate miners, because it breaks a key part of the bitcoin economy. Miners spend real finite energy, are rewarded with bitcoin; and should increase its value as much as possible. They're the most useful part of the economy.

If the miners are thought of as useless scum, we'll devolve to printing bitcoin for free."
"Yeah, it suggests that Chinese is bad or something? Or they just impulsively assumed that whole world has the same anxiety as in USA - China is going to dethrone them from being the first biggest economy, how they can dare, bastards ;p"
"BScore needs to push the ""miners are the enemy"" narrative, otherwise everyone would starting to question ask why BScore is unnecessarily trying to further inflate the miners profits by raising and raising the fees."
Well whoever supported the S2X code proposed for NYA was actually supporting a failed code that would doom BTC. So, kudos, I guess?
They gonna add bch? They need something else but bitcoin damnit

There's kind of a 'if you're not with us you're with the terrorists' thing going on with Core nowadays.  It's funny how they apply so many conspiracy theories to miners/China/Ver/BCH but think nothing of Blockstream hijacking bitcoin development to sell their sidechain bullshit on.  
Without China, BTC would be worth pennies just like it was at the start.
The troll cunt has a point, DCG did once say something in a report that was upsetting to Adam Back on pedantic grounds of how they phrased their conclusion, therefore DCG is obviously furiously jerking off Satan right now alongside Jihan and Roger!
how dare a company try to save its business model by switching to an usable coin??? they should post o r/bitcoin a thread thanking the saints-developers who work for free to save us all from the tyranny of banks by developing a way to turn bitcoin into a bank.
So this is all BS is about? Making a few bucks off BTC? They seemed to me more like a sabotage operation.
That got debunked many times before bro.
That got debunked many times before bro.
WRONG! If market REWARDED bigger blocks ,Bitcoin Cash would be on number one spot right now not Bitcoin.
Then tell me, how *does* it work? And why is this scenario impossible? So far I've had four other people that are more knowledgeable about Lightning than myself explain that yes, this is exactly how it works, so I'm quite curious what we've all gotten wrong.
"WRONG

Worry not. Full blocks doesn’t mean you can’t broadcast a punishing transaction that will get into the next block. It may just cost in fees.

Basically the risk is only up to funds that are in channels that are lower than the current next block fee.

Also, it is not true that Core is set to not increase blocks ever. They want to increase it in a future proof way once a couple of optimizations are done. It’s coming."
How do you figure? A lot of momentum was taken from the fake 2x agreement.  BitPay and Coinbase and other economic nodes are switching to BCH.  Users would rather pay 0-1 cents per transaction than [$1000 on segwitcoin](https://cointelegraph.com/news/ari-paul-tuur-demeester-look-forward-to-up-to-1k-bitcoin-fees).  BCH has been rising at a  much faster rate than BTC, which is probably [being pumped by Bilderberg/AXA forces trying to outrun Bitcoin Cash](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7d02ee/some_thoughts_about_the_possible_bitcoin_segwit/).

Small blockers are openly [advocating for $1000 fees](https://cointelegraph.com/news/ari-paul-tuur-demeester-look-forward-to-up-to-1k-bitcoin-fees).  I guess channels will only be for people with deep pockets.

Its not coming..."
I figure by BCH not being on #1 spot of coinmarketcap
Alrigt kiddo sure thing maga 2020 and all that shit 
Markets need to be instantly 100% efficient?  BCH has been gaining huge ground on segwitcoin and its only going to continue.  BitPay is adopting it this month. Most of the market is not even aware yet of the fee problem on Bitcoin Legacy, and once they find out they all switch to BCH.
Not 100% efficient, but enough time has passed to be clear that market does not reward the dumb block size. If it would be, BCH would not be shitting behind with bleeding bags right now.
"Haha, you think people need to understand code to understand Bitcoin? I got news for you ; the coders like you have fucked it up. "
