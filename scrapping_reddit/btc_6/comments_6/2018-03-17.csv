"The problem is with XRP, which is optional, volatile, and replaceable.

- **Optional**. Banks don't have to use XRP in order to use Ripple.

- **Volatile**. Since XRP is volatile, it is not desirable as a bridge currency.

- **Replaceable**. There is absolutely nothing stopping Ripple from later rolling out XRP2 (pegged to USD), XRP3 (pegged to Euro), etc.  All it will take is a software update.

Ripple and its founders get to collect billions from a crypto-frenzied crowd by issuing a useless token called XRP.  After they've sold off all the XRPs, you think they'll just give up the gravy train?  Of course not.  They'll just start printing up XRP2, XRP3, etc.  It's free money for them."
"When a bank can convert the currency in 4 seconds, then there is no need for a bridge currency.  Just transact in the end currencies directly.  

The only reason there is a need for a bridge currency, is because some 3rd world currencies are illiquid, some even have strict capital controls or are in the middle of a civil war, and it might take days & paperwork to convert.  And in that time, the bank doesn't want to hold a volatile bridge currency which could move the wrong way, and incur losses.  The bridge currency should be as stable as possible."
I think Ripple (**NOT XRP**) has great promise in competing against SWIFT.
I'm bringing back the dead here, but I don't understand why people keep thinking the volatility matters. The banks own the XRP (and volatility) for 4 seconds, not days like the current SWIFT system. There's more volatility in the fluctuation of fiat over several days than there is in ANY crypto over 4 seconds. 
You don't think xRapid is a viable solution?
The current SWIFT system used by 11,000 banks in 200 countries for the purpose of transacting payment orders locally and internationally takes anywhere from 1-5 business days. Just under 10% of them are also lost in the nether without human intervention.

Who is this?
Ehh, not really. Big picture is merchant and user adoption. If Bitcoin BCH can prove a viable currency, small ad hominem shit like this makes literally 0% difference when you look at the big picture. People will use what works and what won't rob them of purchasing power.
"And that's a fair point. In any other context than central banking cartel members, I would agree.

Sometimes exceptions are acceptable, is my point"
That’s true unless the person is self evidently a disease-ridden miserable shambling shit-pile. Then it’s OK.
"> The whole point is not to attack the guy.

I think the point is actually to not attack him \*based on things like his weight and liking bacon\*. Attack him on solid economic points all you want though, because there are plenty of them to use."

"In the context of the U.S.:

The Federal Reserve bank - private corporation comprised of the world's most powerful people (Rothschild's, Morgans, etc) that are in bed with the federal government to use paper fiat currency (NOT money) as a way to syphon wealth from the masses into control of the few.

What do I think about that? Well, I own Bitcoin BCH for a reason."
Military technology and weaponry has gotten so far that even China is scared to pull the trigger
"This theory is assuming China can force it's fiat down it's citizens throats while the rest of the world is using something non-inflationary. 

It could only do that with North Korean style control (ie total control of citizens travel, and no internet), and in a country as big and diverse as China, it's simply impossible. Sure, they do a pretty good job of control now, but that's nothing compared to North Korea. It's a bell they can't unring."

I know the chances of getting an actual response are near-zero but I’d love to hear what you think central banks are and how you think they operate 
You're kind of being an idiot though.  Big picture.  Don't be a jackass.  It reflects on the whole community. 
it makes us look bad, is my point. insults, no matter how bad the receivers are, will always undermine credibility
The whole point is not to attack the guy.  Ad hominem just makes your position look VERY weak.

Jawohl.  Aber englische Grammatik ist schon im Vergleich beschaemend ja?
Then how about you offer some real criticism instead of criticising the rest of the comments 
"Sorry for offending you.  It's objectively shit though.  Just saying, as an aside.  

You're still missing the point and trying to move the conversation further away from it.  I'll give you a hint.  Something about being respectful and not acting like complete trash.  Caught it yet?  It's about how outsiders perceive you and the community you belong in.  "
If you don't understand, I don't have time to explain it to you, sorry.
Your personal assessment of the quality of the satire has no bearing on the topic at hand.
That's what I've been saying all along. Ad hominem is when you attack a person based on their character or personal traits. An attack on that person based on economic issues that they helped to cause is not an ad hominem attack.
Maybe it's true that you're making a statement, but effectively it leads to little and most people end up voting the the bigger parties. If people would be given a paper that said to write 3 choices in order of preference, that would solve the issue with voting and voting third parties would actually be meaningful. 
?
"Okay.  Bend over backwards to miss the point.   It's a free country.

I love me some satire.  If that's what you're calling this, then it's shit satire.  Sorry if that's triggery for you.  "
Criticize him for it then.  Be reasonable.  Ad hominem does not reflect well at all.  
Voting a minor party is never wasted. Your making a statement. Voting something you 100% dont care about is wasted.
Welcome to Naivety 101, today we are going to learn that banksters love all humanity :) its going to be a reeeal feel-gooder today, kids!
OK, that's fair. However my other comments stated that I don't *always* condone it. There are some exceptions, in my opinion, this particular instance with that fat piece of shit being one of them.
Public figures are legitimate targets of satire. Sorry if that’s triggery for you.
And what if those issues were caused by decisions he made and actions he took?
Too much of the economy relies on the government payouts now. The party lines are simply ways to directly or indirectly increase paychecks at the expense of the few that don't care, dont vote, or think that they are voting on issues other than monetary policy. 
There are not plenty of options without alternative vote. A vote in a minor party is essentially wasted. https://youtu.be/3Y3jE3B8HsE
Yep. George Washington, our first president, foresaw that this would happen, too.
"""Beschämend"" wäre ein bisschen übertrieben. ;-)"
lmao
Big picture is also how new comers see the established community.  When we're condoning shit flinging, it reflects on us all.  
"No.  No it's not.  

It really does not play as well as you think it does for you, or your community. "
Don't attack him at all.  Attack the issues.

This guy is the perfect weapon.  When he shows up in a conversation, people just talk about his weight, so the actual issue of his _threat_ never gets discussed.  Fucking idiots.

This is insulting to bacon - it would be hard to get fat from only eating high fat, high protein foods. This guy is likely fat from eating simple carbs.

"It's not an ""ad-hominem"", it's actual irony.

These fat cats are on top of the biggest ponzi in history, frequently found engaged in corruption (which is usually played off as innocent incompetence or bad fortune) and complicit in destroying the environment. They can't even take care of their own health and own their shit in the most simple terms, but at the same time expect us to believe they know best how to take care of the economy's health.

A living trope of unhinged hubris and greed."
How do you get to the point of being a literal blob? Like even if you're rich as fuck life still has to be miserable in that condition. It's like being trapped in a flesh prison.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agust%C3%ADn_Carstens Manager of the Central bank of Central banks, BIS. 
Interesting concept, but how does it play out for defense of your nation if every country has converted to Bitcoin except China. In China they have their own central bank controlled money and can secretly print as much as they want to pay their citizens to do work, mine for raw metals in the country, make machinery, guns, tanks, fighter jets, warships and pay for the army/navy/airforce out of thin air. Essentially they can get everyone to do work for them for nothing. Now China want to invade their Asian neighbouring countries like Japan, Malaysia etc with their well fed and motivated 1 million strong army. How do the other countries defend? They have to expend Bitcoin to pay for their tanks, jets, frigates, troops, missiles, munitions etc and their Bitcoin is a finite resource. Once its spent, it's spent. Maybe the government can raise taxes on its corporations and citizens to fund the war effort but they might still only be able to muster half of what is required for defense. They will still get steamrolled by China who can pay for its army/navy and airforce for nothing.
