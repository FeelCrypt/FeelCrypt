Especially if you know a bit about how the blockchain works and the real world.
you misspelled Cardano
"> (...) a mixture of attack and altruism

Or just by accident.

I suppose that if a node A restarts, the mempool is cleared, the server will receive transactions from its peers, and it will rebroadcast those transactions like if they were fresh (transactions does not have any timestamp attached to them) and keep them for two weeks.

So the transaction stays behind in node A even if they are evicted by B, C and D.  Then B restarts, and ask its peers for all transactions in the mempool - and will get the outdated transaction once more from A.

I'm not sure it works like this, but it sounds plausible to me."
Indeed, I stand corrected. I should have said it will rebroadcast any unconfirmed transactions. If it is running as a wallet.
I believe a full node will drop all transactions from the mempool after a restart
ohh shut up
Not when the entire blockchain becomes orders of magnitude larger over time.

"> But let's put that aside... Ripple is going to accomplish what exactly? 30-60% cost savings for banks vs using SWIFT and save banking customers days in international wires? Woopee... Pretty much every crypto can do that. Fuck, DOGE can do that, with even lower fees and it's a freggin meme coin. Only difference is Doge is not going to get integrated into core banking software platforms.

You answered your own question. ""only difference is doge is not going to get integrated into core banking software platforms"" ...Thats a big difference, its the whole point. Ripple has gained the trust of over 100 banks/FI's with their incredible technology and incredible team backing them. In order to facilitate cross border settlements there needs to be a bridge currency implemented within all of the participating banks software that supports all other currencies. This is what ripple has been doing for the past few years, gaining trust and partnerships. In order for another coin to replace them they would have to pitch and sell their software to all of these banks and replace what ripple has already done to perfection... not happnen bruh.   "

Regulation. I work in the banking industry and have been for a good chunk of the last decade and there is no chance as hell that the federal reserve passes regulation ( per my discussion with the NY fed chair) to use a token which it does not control and open to price manipulation viz a viz insiders owning a good chunk in their personal account making the ex CEO the 14th richest person in the world. Xrapids is token independent and feds might use xrapids but with their own token not xrp. You can quote me to your ripple friends.

[50,000 transactions in the last 24 hours](https://bitinfocharts.com/), so more than 10 people using it.  Meanwhile, next 5 currencies are processing 2.8 million TPD, while original Bitcoin did 0.46 million, so it has already been outclassed in usage.

You know I am a Christan and I believe in revelation 13:18. I might be helping set the road to fulfill prophecy. Crytpo is so powerful ... it can also be used for bad. Bank notes can't refuse to go to a person, programmable money can. Not that I am scared of crypto but it can be used for evil too. It's a tool and a very powerfull tool. It might be one day that crypto will be abused and programmable money will become an instrument of slavery instead of freedom. Be careful what you trust in. The USD says: In God We Trust but that God is money. I trust in the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob, the God who send his Son Jesus Christ to die for us. 

Right now crypto gives me more individual freedom but one day there might be crypto that will be abused by the beast. Then I will still trust in God and no longer use any money. "

Pyotr Alexeevich Kropotkin (; Russian: Пётр Алексе́евич Кропо́ткин; December 9, 1842 – February 8, 1921) was a Russian activist, scientist, and philosopher, who advocated anarchism.

Born into an aristocratic land-owning family, he attended a military school and later served as an officer in Siberia, where he participated in several geological expeditions. He was imprisoned for his activism in 1874 and managed to escape two years later. He spent the next 41 years in exile in Switzerland, France (where he was imprisoned for almost 4 years) and in England.

You are correct, and I updated my previous post to reflect that.  

The other limit is there is only a finite amount of Treasury bonds and other assets which they are allowed by law to buy, and as a practical matter, some other holders would not sell.  For example, the Social Security Trust Fund holds Treasury Bonds as their sole asset, and they aren't allowed to sell it for something else."

"Fact 1 : 

1 entity owns 70% of xrp supply. That entity can make xrp crash whenever they want, and effectively control the price at a very fixed rate per USD.

Fact 2: 

Banks cannot own bitcoin, it would be way too expensive for them to buy out bitcoin at the current price.

Hypothesis:

How would a nation buy out bitcoin? The nation wants it at a discount, right? How do you make it discounted? By offering a cheaper alternative (ripple). When everyone is into ripple, that entity that owns 70% of ripple can sell out and buy all the bitcoins that were traded off. Effectively crashing the ripple price and raising bitcoins to 100k/btc or bch. "
Banks are not going away anytime soon. XRP is just a payment system... it isnt a religion so dont worry whichever coin cult you belong too isnt threatened.

I watched the first season and it was great. Then started the second one and I couldn't finish it. I think I didn't even watch half of the episodes. The first one were just really boring...
In my case I did like it but most of the people feel that the second one is a bad one but that it was needed to continue with the third one which is good again.

First scam iv done thats made me a millionaire
I am all for BCH (own almost 100), new tech, decentralization, anonymity and privacy. But I dont see how Ripple eliminating waste in the financial/banking industry is a bad thing. Old people wont be able to really use cryptos. I know because I have been spent the past 3 months trying to get my grandpa set up and trading but to no avail... and he WANTS to learn. He even admits that the vast majority of people his age wont be able to crypto without messing something up (losing coins, gets hacked, etc). But XRP will reduce friction (aka costs) in the financial industry thus helping out the captive older populations. 
"> It's just they are no longer relevant.

What are you on about? Mainstream media websites have been one of the dominant (and also reputable) sources for news today. 

It's much more likely that the bank backed cryptos will become the most dominant and reputable sources for digital currency. "

"In fact, I don't regard the EU as ""unelected authorians"". The EU idea was to have an economic union, free movement across borders in hoping this will help ensuring a peaceful coexistence among its member countries. Europe's history is full of wars, and I formly believe mutual understanding of each others cultures and develop stable democracies is way to avoid future wars, and is a future I want.

I think I have plenty of opportunities to address issues (and there may be many) to my local (EU)politicians in my area, and I lived in multiple countires with free media, where I also can speak without fear of repression, and where state media is critical to the ruling government. (!)

EU is a collection of counties which adhere to a shared set of democratic values. No country was forced to join the EU. I sincerely believe e.g. Poland has profited well from EU investments into e.g. infrastructure. 
EU is also appreciating freedom of speech and protecting minorities, helping peaceful coexistence.

EU is not replacing and ruling states, but defining a common set of values (something which is being discussed heavily) which are economically supported in many ways.

Now, regarding your comment, see it from my point of view: why should I as an EU citizen and taxpayer continue support a country which suddenly decides to destroy fundamental principles of democracy (division of power), and where the state media suddenly synchronizes with the ruling party and silences any voice of oposition? This is not part of any EU contract, so I think EU has all right to apply measures here.
If you don't like it, then you may do another Brexit, noone can decide against the will of the people as long as you are in a free country.

Of course, from your point of view it may look like some ""Authority in Brussels"" is trying to ""rule"" your country. I think some people even benefit from spreading this false narrative. Maybe you should check this more thoroughly, in the end it may be based on some ideals people have voted for.

Oh, and old apparatchiks could be replaced by other means than installing an oligarcy, for sure. Especially if these are violating democratic fundaments, I am sure your local (EU-)politicians would like to hear about your thoughts.

And finally, know that I was very anti-EU for many years, but my many visits to Poland made me change my mind.

good luck with your new life, but i have a question, is turkey not in europe? they're half here half there as i know?
Good luck.  Your anecdote is not a panacea.  Crypto just makes the rich richer.  Hadn't you noticed?
Nice. Spoken like a true 22d old shill account. 
Subtle
">for a BCH based project idea I had

Why do you thank Bitcoin Cash? You had an idea obviously, not Bitcoin Cash. And if you are moving to Europe now that you got paid, it means that you cashed your Bitcoin Cash out.

I was a freelancer for years and if you thank money for what you are accomplishing, you are doing something wrong.

Good luck though on your project!"
Best of luck to you!!
Turkey has just released ‘Roach Coin’ and its on the rise 
"Goodluck ;)"
Wow good on you and the samaritan
"Where do you live now? :)
"
Can you send me a link to some projects you did? 
Crypto currency gave you a better life. Just leave it at that. 
I’m looking to move to Poland someday as well! I’m from USA. 
"That is a beautiful story! Best of luck to you.
YAY crypto community!"
Good luck! Come to the UK, we need Web Devs :)
"There is no ""insane poverty"" in Turkey. As a matter of fact I am sure Turkey has above average standard of living compared to the world. But yeah I am sorry your military couldn't get that bastard. It seems like the old guard of military that knew how to do coups didn't pass the knowledge properly :("
"That you can move freely thought EU is a fact, but if you are planning to stay to work in a country you'll need the right paperwork, and that takes time and aint so easy how it seems... Resident card will prolly requares you to have a solid income, (a taxable one).
And crypto is not there yet unless you are a daily trader...which will apply a higher income tax kinda as an independent person... I dunno how taxes work for Poland tho. But calling Turkey ""Extremly poor country"" aint true + Asking later if someone from Poland knows blonde blue eye chics + thinking that with €2000 +- in bitcoin cash at the current price you gonna survive for the project the rent the electricity and food= makes aaall too much of a troll.
Gets your facts straight, thank crypto currencies and 
Good luck anyways, ""where theres a will theres a way"".
"
Thats a troll account and he lies in this forum. There is no extreme poverty in Turkey. He just tryimg to get some symphaty for points.  What a loser...
Good to hear! Really sorry to hear about the devolution of your beautiful home country. Best of luck with your new life!
3 cheers for the positive energy of gratitude!
Sad ergogan is turning turkey to shit, it used to be a good secular democracy, which separated religion from the state. That is slowly changing and i hope turkey doesn't become another middle east shit hole. 
"It is above average for the world as a whole. It is probably equal or even higher than some EU countries (Bulgaria, Romania?). This is hardly ""insane poverty"". Good luck looking for a better life and I'd surely not want to stay in a country that becomes too religious especially Islamic ones but you should not exaggerate your current situation because you might end up disappointed that the life in a ""civilized country"" is not that much better especially for a foreigner."

"What's happening to Turkey is a complete travesty. This isn't what Ataturk envisioned, he wanted a secular modern state. Back in the 1960's, Turkey was transitioning into a modern nation in the western style where women actually had rights, and now this horror show. It's just a tragedy across the board, where the dictator-for-life builds himself a 1000-room palace and oppresses and slaughters people who oppose him. 

I'm glad you're seeing a way out, but it's such a shame what's happening to that nation."

"I don't know about insane poverty in Turkey (technically untrue, as others have stated), but ""free life with dignity"" is an important quality that Europe tends to offer, so I get your point.

As for those who say this is not about Bitcoin (Cash), they obviously do not get the reason behind the movement at all.

Anyway, best of luck in your future endeavors. (edit: seems tippr is inactive, gonna re-submit the tip when it is back)

"Extreme poverty? Seriously? Do you even know what is poverty then?

What about dictatorship? There was a military coup. 5 million (!) syrian refugees came to Turkey during the last few years. The PKK terror organization and others did endless terror attacks in Istanbul and other cities. If the US would suffer from that much terror attacks you can be sure there would be much more than just the police on the street.  Without a strong leader this country would fall apart. 

I have been to Turkey around 6 times during the last few years. Didnt see poverty, but what I saw are extremely frightened people. But not because of their president, but terror attacks and terrorists.

This guy is obviously a troll.

You are right man, moving to a country who has laxer internet laws, higher skill developers, and hosting options is misappropiating their funds bad. I want to get under ground from shame now.

i know you can troll better than that, i believe in you
Didn't buy it, received it as funding for a few bitcoin cash based project I am working on. Which semt?
"Nope. There have been negations to enter the EU, but they are ""on hold"" due to the recent political developents. Their leader turned into changed quite some laws to empower himself to a dictator-like position. This and some very nasty things that have been said (on both sides) led to the current situation."
it's capitalism that makes the rich richer... crypto allows exchange between agents, but it can't by itself change who are the owners, that requires additional direct action
Its amazing how much people anthropomorphize and demonize the compounding effect of capital. Like any of them would be complain if it was *their* money that was compounding.
Spoken like a dilettante.

"Firstly: sorry for your situation in turkey and I can understand you want to leave... But that taken aside..

So someone donated money to you ""for a project"" and you turn around and use this money to fix your private life? I would feal a bit taken aback as a donor and would suspect my donation was being misappropriated.

It's above average for the third world, not so much for a civilized country though. You are right about the latter part, if they were to succeed I'd definitely stay.

"> As a matter of fact I am sure Turkey has above average standard of living compared to the world  

__Bullshit.__  
[OECD](http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/countries/turkey/) seems to say otherwise - pretty much everything is below average.

> * Turkey ranks above the average in civic engagement. It ranks below average in income and wealth, health status, social connections, education and skills, jobs and earnings, subjective well-being, environmental quality, work-life balance, housing andpersonal security.  
> * the average household net-adjusted disposable income per capita is lower than the OECD average of USD 30 563 a year.  
> * 51% of people aged 15 to 64 in Turkey have a paid job, belowthe OECD employment average of 67%, and one of the lowest figures in the OECD.  
> * In Turkey, 39% of adults aged 25-64 have completed upper secondary education, much lower than the OECD average of 74% and one of the lowest rates among OECD countries.  
> * In general, Turks are less satisfied with their lives than the OECD average. When asked to rate their general satisfaction with life on a scale from 0 to 10, Turkish people gave it a 5.5 grade on average, much lower than the OECD average of 6.5.  

Also worth noting that current political climate affects are not clearly visable in stats so the situation might be even worse.   
If anything you should understand the value of getting in/out early as crypto investor and see OP's reasoning. Though personally I think Poland isn't doing much better with the current conservative gonverment.

Minimum wage in Turkey is about USD 470 a month or USD 5600 a year.

"This conversation needs to be simplified.

I'll do it for everyone... ready?

Blockstream came into the picture to develop a narrative and a technology that promises to **keep banks in the mix**. 

Period.

Bitcoin cut out the banks. You think they were going to sit and watch their empire be fucking destroyed? Come on, man.

Banks are extensions of central banks. Governments are extensions of central banks. Central banks are the very definition of money, power and oppression. They will see this world fucking burn before they give any of that power up."
"I was talking about the title. The rest is overreaction obviously. 

Other than that, there is very solid evidence for censorship (I was banned myself for merely stating that I believed SegWit2x would win). There have also been a lot of DDoS attacks, my Bitcoin nodes were attacked several times. Although who did that remains unclear."
Fiat is arguably a crime against humanity.  Bitcoin is a working solution.  To co-opt and dismantle Bitcoin is therefore to perpetuate fiat and the oppression that comes with it.
I agree with you, but you can't say XRP and BTC's orchestrated propaganda didn't work extremely well, at least up to now.
"I have a suspicion that the rich *not* being completely in charge of wealth is the crime against humanity he's referring to. The hyperbole of this post very closely resembles the libertarian hyperbole of ""marginal progressive income tax is literally slavery""."
Debt slavery causes all of that
"Unless that magical internet money has the potential to change the world so fundamentally that by hindering its adoption you are indirectly leading to the death of an unknowable number of people.

How many more people in the world would have died if we had never gotten the printing press? How about the internet?

Not saying that ""crime against humanity"" wasn't a stretch, given what crimes against humanity actually means. But it certainly isn't crazy."
Okay, doesn't fit the exact definition. Meanwhile, poor people in Africa and other third world areas are missing out on the societal and (thus) humanitarian progress that bitcoin could provide them. Not such a fun thing to delay. Is it still really such hyperbole?
"**Crimes against humanity**

Crimes against humanity are certain acts that are deliberately committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack or individual attack directed against any civilian or an identifiable part of a civilian population. The first prosecution for crimes against humanity took place at the Nuremberg trials. Crimes against humanity have since been prosecuted by other international courts – such as the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and the International Criminal Court, as well as in domestic prosecutions. The law of crimes against humanity has primarily developed through the evolution of customary international law.

If you dislike BTC, use BCH, or any other cryptocurrency.

This rabid flamewar and hissy fits over the name ""Bitcoin"" are the worst parts of all cryptocurrency discussion. /r/Bitcoin may be censored to hell and full of dumb memes, but this sub just comes across as a hateful anti-BTC circlejerk.

Saying that developers taking an open-source software project in a direction you dislike doesn't make them comparable to war criminals and getting downvoted for it somehow perfectly summarises everything wrong with the sub."

"Seeing as they literally destroyed a system which promised to bring fair banking to the world with sound money principles, yes, it *is* a crime against humanity. The btc core network currently has fees at an average higher than $10 - which makes the system entirely useless for almost 80% of the world (low income countries.) 

The original value of bitcoin was the ability to be your own bank, and that promise was the greatest economic innovation in thousands of years.

For better or for worse, it's the truth though. I say let it be, and simply be the change that you want. This is after all a decentralized community around a decentralized coin.

To me you're sensationalising this quite a bit. But I think you do have a point.
What?
You literally just believe that's true? Why do you think that? You realize that I'm telling you that that's not true, right? I've done a lot of research, I'm not failing to do basic research. I think you're failing to understand the strangeness of this situation. It's not something that happens in the normal corporate world. You have to think about its newness.
"We're currently at 0.16 fake Bitcoin (BTC) for one real Bitcoin (BCH). If we get to price parity, ever just once, then BTC will crumble and probably die.

They have to continually sell their worthless ""gold"" for more than our actual useful currency or it will die."
Indeed.

Just a regular reminder: ""Sound money"" is considered by most economists to be worse for the economy (ie, make people worse off) than ""unsound money"".

"So core’s vision for bitcoin is a crime against humanity.  Don’t you see how that puts new user to crypto off.  Try core’s vision for bitcoin is holding back bitcoin’s day to day uses. Bitcoin core is great as a store of value, but for day to day transaction the Bitcoin Cash version of bitcoin is much better.

">You make it sound like making an ASIC is as easy as picking a few parts from your local computer store and slapping it together.

No I'm not, but mining is a competitive business, it has become this way because in order to make profit you need to have a high percentage of hashpower. You're basically ""It is unfair that Amazon has all this money and technology and workforce and stock because my own little online store cannot compete.""

Well I guess you cannot compete then, at least not without putting any investement and effort into your own project.

Pretty neutral about the btc/bch debate, but doesn’t normal btc also have whale mining? I assume they are also open to manipulation by a small group of miners. (And let’s not forget they are open to manipulation by a small group of coders too).

Given the source of their funding, it seems **easily possible** that ""big money"" doesn't want Bitcoin to succeed and is actively trying to hinder its adoption... if you don't want to call that big money a ""world domination conspiracy"" that's fine, especially since no one else in this thread has. Cryptorebel only said ""The oligarchy is trying to maintain its power by co-opting the system."", which is pretty likely."

BCH doesn't care about some guy making hyperbole. And that aside, how much of that have you really seen here? I'm here a lot and I see something like that very occasionally.

As for global domination conspiracy. You realize most people talk like this (they're not necessarily saying these guys are aiming for global domination, is that what you think?) because these corporations really do own finance and do have huge influence in the world. That's all though, they're just really damn powerful. No global domination illuminati new world order mind control lol."
Yeah except they have no logic or proof to back it up. Read my post it has about 2 dozen linked sources.
Except no one is trying to cripple its blockchain from being used beside people hating freedom of choice, the free market and free speech which they all converged to your useless crippled blockchain. 
News is Quebec, just to the north of me, are recently starting to try to lure miners with cheap hydroelectric power. Watch them try to spin that into some racist narrative about decedent Quebecois lol.

The sum total value of cryptocurrency right now is $770,274,435,425. Over seven and a half *billion* dollars. It isn't just shut ins on the internet. It's middle class investors, internet shut ins, Saudi princes, Chinese party insiders, Venezuelans using it to buy bread to avoid hyperinflation, large corporations, the U.S. government, the North Korean government, banks, investment funds, etc. At this point, cryptocurrency is a well established high value asset, the fact that it's very new notwithstanding, grandpa."
Whoever written that copyright law was created to slow the spread of information is a dumbass. Copyright was supposed to last a maximum of 30 years and make sure authors profited off their work, thus giving motivation to write new literary stories or scientific discoveries. Now obviously copyright right now is way too long and no longer benefits the author as it's still applied when they're dead.

"No I really have to agree with him.  I've been banned from r/bitcoin (and was the [#2 most censored poster there one month for trying to explain the need for a blocksize increase](https://www.reddit.com/r/noncensored_bitcoin/comments/7414nf/september_2017_stats_post/)), but this sub has basically turned into people posting what frankly sounds like insane conspiracy theories nonstop.  Yes, the way they run r/bitcoin and censor the shit out of everything is idiotic, and yes, the Core dev team has a bunch of nutsos.

But while everyone in this sub is wasting all day whining about Core or whatever other cryptocurrencies are stealing marketshare from both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. I mean seriously guys, half the bullshit drama here is about whether to be insulted when people call it BCash. There's more posts here about bullshit than about actual development and future plans.

If people don't cut this horseshit out then we'll find zero newcomers to crypto who want to support Bitcoin Cash, it's simple as that.  Nobody who stumbles into this subreddit is going to want to buy any Bitcoin Cash when they start reading nonstop threads that basically just whine about the conspiracy against Bitcoin Cash or Bitcoin or whatever. That's why even a centralized shitcoin like Ripple has surpassed Bitcoin Cash's market cap.

Seriously, the negativity around here is completely out of control. r/bitcoin has a bunch of worthless memes and price talk all day, but this sub has turned into something even less appealing to newcomers.

And you guys can downvote me all you want, but I've been in crypto since 2011 and I don't really give a shit what most folks think. I would like Bitcoin Cash to do well since it's part of my holdings but the nonstop negativity here has been a serious turnoff and has resulted in pretty stagnant interest. The fact that numerous other cryptocurrencies are surpassing our market cap is a sign that people are losing interest because they don't want to hear this garbage. Going on TV and attacking Bitcoin Core does NOTHING positive for Bitcoin Cash."
Jeez dude, you sound pissed, but there is value in questioning these hyperbolic posts. It might not have a negative effect on development, but no one said it has so that’s just a false dichotomy/straw man/insert any number of things here. It obviously has some negative effects on the community, which is key to progress. Imagine any sane new person coming here seeing this junk at the top of the thread. In fact, you don’t even need to imagine it, just read the comments.

"I hated everything about that video. Especially his ""joke"" at the end. 

However, one cannot disagree with facts. If everything his said is true (which I cannot confirm because I'm not knowledgeable enough on the topics), that would be really, really sad. Like a dream being crushed by the things we wanted to overcome like corporate greed and the interests of banks.

If the LN were really such a danger, I don't think it'd ever be approved. Maybe there's something he's not seeing (or deliberately omitting) like some sort of autonomous decentralized node created through ICOs or some other thing. I'm not an engineer.

It seems shortsighted to think a company would be able singlehandedly outsmart several million people now that we have the internet.

Edit: corporationally/corporatevely crushed -> by the corporate things we hated

Edit2: I also dislike how the video assumes no other scalability solution other than sidechains and lightning will ever be implemented. At this point, I think the only reason the devs didn't hard fork to a dynamic block size is because it requires a hardfork. I remember seeing a thread from 2013 where core devs and users were discussing block size increase and they even shared a few snippets of code."

"> Fiat is arguably a crime against humanity. 

It is also arguably what has allowed the economic management leading to the largest lift out of poverty the world has ever seen.

Both points are extremist and can be argued for; I'd find it easier to argue for the ""largest life out of poverty"" point than the ""crime against humanity"" one, though."
"Fun game.

I think *patriarchy* is a crime against humanity. Feminism is a working solution. To co-opt and dismantle feminism is therefore to perpetuate patriarchy and the oppression that comes with it.
(Therefore, if you disagree with me about feminism, I'm going to accuse you of committing a crime against humanity.)

I think *mass graves caused by heart disease* is a crime against humanity. Apple watch is a working solution. To co-opt and dismantle Apple is therefore to perpetuate death and heart disease and the oppression that comes with it. (Therefore, if you aren't an Apple fanboi in the precise way I want you to be, I'm going to accuse you of committing a crime against humanity.)

There are two parts of your hyperbole that need to be understood separately. First, you are putting the existence of government or privately issued currency on the same level as literally rounding up millions of Jews and systematically murdering them. Sure. You might be able to make a convoluted argument that this causes that and that causes this and this causes that and that causes suffering.

Secondly, however, you are also conflating *disagreeing with your ideal monetary policy* with *deliberately trying to sabotage international monetary justice*.

**Your position essentially boils down to ""If you think that the size of a blockchain should be 2GB then you're literally Jesus, but if you think it should be 1GB then you're literally Hitler"".**

Does this help you to understand why your position seems insane to me?"
"How many people do you know enslaved by debt as a direct result of the actions by Bitcoin Core?

It's hyperbole. I can't even believe someone has to argue this point."
You might as well say capitalism has caused the deaths of millions and call it a crime against humanity. Cryptocrurrency is supposed to run in a capitalist framework anyway.

Haha.  He nailed it right?  What a deluded group of people."

And why the fuck would anyone want a private untaxable money system?  The rules are the ONLY thing that keeps the more powerful of the world from dominating the less powerful.  Thats why we have rules.

">I still have no idea how they claim mathematical currency will make the world a better place.

No, see... You and I both agree that mathematical currency will make the world a better place. The only thing I'm objecting to is that if I don't agree with you *exactly* on the specifics of that math, you talk as if I am part of an evil plot to destroy the world.

It's the fucking **HYPERBOLE** we're objecting to, for the last fucking time."
For the sake of simple comparison, yeah. My only input would be that fiat cash isn't some kind of directly taxable smart money either, and we still pay taxes. Just because they aren't coded into the system doesn't mean they can't be still used by society. 
"This is simple.

The bitcoin core developers want the same thing you want. They just think that the best way to get it is to exclude the bottom n% poorest people by keeping transaction fees high to motivate miners.

May I disagree with you about the best way to go about creating a decentralized secure monetary instrument without you accusing me of committing crimes against humanity? Please?"
> What they have done is a crime against humanity. 
"You are either mistaken about, or deliberately misrepresenting, the definition of the phrase ""crimes against humanity"".

Yeah man you have a reasonable argument, other dude flaming me got me all trollish, it's not like an end of the world rant or anything, but the comparison is fair. My point is that peoples passion for this comes from knowing the good that fair finances can do. However, the specifics of the math are not debatable opinions, they have factual basis, cores implementation is broken, the math is broken, and the fees have a technical cause. People get political with hyperbole and shit because the technical aspects were taken away from engineers and given to PR. 
Oh woah sorry man.  I thought you were on board with the whole crypto is stupid idea, which I am firmly on.  Money works just fine for me, tbh.  Never had a problem.  But yea, at least we agree the deluded hyperbole needs to stop.

I disagree that the problem is with mining itself, rather, the problem is with the selected algorithm. Should BCH fork into an algorithm that's ASIC resistant, suddenly the market space favors people like me (an ETH miner) rather than chinese megafarms. A fork like that would be hashrate *suicide* mind you (so much lost trust), but it could be done if the loss of hashrate and confidence were seen as preferable to the continued dominance of ASIC farms (NOTE: a communist nationalization of the megafarms in China might be such a trigger)."

In fact, I am much more outraged at the idea that the former scenario you describe exists, and it was the potential of bitcoin to mitigate such humanitarian concerns by providing an equal and sound financial system for global use. Sound money and wealth has an inverse correlation with crime, observed time and time again. It was bitcoin that promised a fair playing field for us all, and now it's ... what... a greed based ""digistock?"" A ""store of value?""

">Should BCH fork into an algorithm that's ASIC resistant, suddenly the market space favors people like me 

It's completely pointless to do that. Why do you think you deserve to mine Bitcoin but other people with ASICs don't? (Which btw aren't only Chinese people).

They were examples of hyperbole, not hyperbolic examples.
Speculation paired with real daily use in the clear, gray and dark markets.  Low fees were clearly part of that.  But how the fees were kept low were not.
"I thought you were being sarcastic until reading the edit.

The IRS taxes. It's nothing new. Bitcoins were already taxed just the same as other commodities like gold and silver. Every movement of crypto isn't a taxable event -- only when trading a crypto for something else (such as USD or a different crypto).

Think of it this way, if Bitcoin traders are paying taxes, the government is less likely to ban it. "
"I don't mind ASICs persay, but I think 81% of hashpower on ASIC based coins (and this is not unique to bitcoin) resides in China, primarily in very easily targeted mining farms (not pools, warehouses full of ASICs). That's easy to nationalize, and then 51% attacks are trivial.

I don't have a problem with ASICs, I have a problem with China. What I said would alleviate the problem, but again it'd be suicide to do it without a serious trigger. I'd imagine such a fork would occur *only after* China both nationalized the farms *and* manipulated the currency."

Look at the market cap of next gen coins.. they are going to eclipse both BTC and BCH soon, leaving both in the dust, whilst these two groups are still quarreling.
Anybody supporting Core/Blockstream are also knowingly or unknowingly supporting these atrocities.
It's about scaling, not being grand. 
"This post belongs on /r/shitpost for saying a bunch of nothing and still managing get 500 upvotes. Like every other second post on this sub, you get some retard that doesn't know shit about the technology and as such would rather focus on bad politics or philosophy behind it to feel included in a discussion where nobody says anything. These things are all still theoretical and obviously will never be realistically applied exactly as these stupid ideologues think they will.  It takes one to think and another to apply, it's why there are currencies such as Raiblocks which require no mining or transaction fees, and then there are currencies that are very different from anything else like Ripple, and then you have Bitcoin Cash which is barely an improvement from the original Bitcoin, literally just bumping up the block size. Instead of discussing how economically this could save the planet and third world people or how this could even be introduced to them, they'd rather just pat off each other's dicks by saying Bitcoin Cash is literally Bitcoin, or why /r/bitcoin sucks even though that's the only goddamn reason anyone is here. 

And even when circlejerking nimrods like OP take a massive shit in the form of a political post like this, they still are able to explain nothing, as their political opinions are worthless. Who the fuck are the bitcoin code/block stream developers, and what did they do? What is one of the crimes against humanity they committed? Is the only reason OP saying the tech isn't the only big point is because he doesn't know shit about anything else?

"Oh dear lordy. The ""big evil banks"" were never 'cut out'. Bitcoin (BTC) will never destroy banking. BCH will not either.

 You guys sound a lot like 'Pizzagate' people. 
There is no giant conspiracy. Most people still use banks. I transfer Bitcoin into my bank via coinbase on a regular basis.  I pay my taxes. If you think you can cheat the government you have a rude awakening coming

Both are useful. Let me hit you with a little reality: Banks are still useful. They are not all lizardpeople. Bitcoin will not replace banks, it will coexist beside it. And btw,  BCH and your childish calls for 'the flippining' (lol) will never happen either. AT BEST, BCH will continue to exsist along side BTC.

I'm an old time Bitcoiner from the 2012 days, and we were all purged by theymos/bashco years ago for not following the anti-scaling party rhetoric. It really is as absurd and hyperbolic as the title states. 
"
I tend to agree .. the most important thing now is we _use_ BCH day to day, and improve the tooling around it.     

The real revolution comes when it replaces cash and banking.    I had to go to a physical bank branch the other day, and queue up and wait, its so old fashioned and impractical just to move some cash around.  The time before that, after I'd waited 25 mins, the teller wanted to sell me insurance, arghhh!!

Its pretty liberating when you can send a tip across the world, easily .. I never used Bitcoin before the fork, even though I was a believer .. because the fees would always be too high for small sends.. I never wanted to risk anything or experiment.

I've tried a couple wallets with BCH .. some are a bit clunky, some ok, they will improve.  I can move funds around and have been trying smaller fees.. the last one was $10 sent to a relative, and the fee was around 1 cent USD.  

It feels a bit liberating - wont solve all the worlds problems, but I think it will have a new empowering / democratizing effect ... and I always think that more commerce within and between countries makes war less likely.

"
I'm from 2011 and I can assure you the OP is true and relevant. We're talking about a revolutionary new public good, ie sound money, that central banks have fought for years (gold) because the stakes of power and wealth are so enormous. You have to be an Austrian economic follower and /or previous gold bug to really understand. It also helps to have traded and or studied fiat markets in depth to appreciate the massive manipulation and corruption that exist there and what alot of sophisticated investors are trying to get away from (think of the bans on shorting financial stocks in 2008, bailouts, money printing, no one went to prison, TARP, etc). Blockstream is equivalent to the Fed controlling the money supply, ie, they're trying to control the blocksize supply and thus the price of using money, eerily similar to interest rates (except their strategy is one way crippling to advantage LN /SC's).

All friends want crypto to take off:) the name of currency or size of blocks does not matter. Friends wanted all revolutions, french, cuban, american or any little consumerist revolution you feel tied to. The current monetary one as well. Up and forward, always up and forward. This may not be real, but its true.
Truth is you are only fighting for a name and it's come to define the coin.
Yes, and they're back with Ripple. Two prong attack.
A lot of this maybe true but it will take more than bigger blocks to solve scaling. The solution probably lies with a coin that does not have the 'Bitcoin' name unfortunately.
"You might be right that it's ineffective. Particularly considering most people who own BTC probably have no idea how it works and gobble up the narrative that even 2MB blocks were too big for the network to handle.

To put the absurdity of that claim into context, I usually try to explain that a 2MB block would've only been processed, on average, every ten minutes. Considering most people have an internet connection capable of streaming Netflix/YouTube, that claim is utterly insane.

So, to people that understand this, the notion that Core is probably not just being illogical, but also malicious appears incredibly likely.

And that only covers one aspect of Core's behaviour. It does not include all the censorship, character slander and sock-puppeting that they also engage in."
"OP does not pertain r/bitcoin vs r/btc.

While they are significantly different, the more important difference is in Bitcoin vs Bitcoin Cash.

Bitcoin used to follow the vision for a peer to peer electronic cash with low fees.  It no longer does.  Bitcoin Cash forked to maintain that vision.  I consider that to be a takeover.  The more people who are aware of this, the stronger opposition."
Everything in the title is accurate. But I agree it serves nobody, we should instead focus on how we can help BCH.
"I am not distorting what was said. The bitcoin core developers have been accused of committing ""a crime against humanity"" for deciding that keeping transaction fees high is good for the currency.

I'm sorry if you feel like I've cherry picked the worst example. By all means, please peruse [the list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_indicted_in_the_International_Criminal_Court#List_of_indictees) of people who have committed crimes against humanity and take your pick. I'll let you choose the example I use.

Notice that not a single one of them was convicted for standing in the way of some grand project that is ""of the highest significance to mankind"".

>You're surely about as emotionally stable as Kylo Ren

>but go ahead and get more egg on your face

>multiple different people are arguing against you

>You're just intellectually dishonest and an asshole

I'm sorry that I hurt your feelings, but that is not rational discourse. Please do a better job, or just don't bother. This entire time, all you've had to do is explain the nature of this alleged ""crime against humanity"". Can you? What specifically did the bitcoin core developers *do* that constitutes a ""crime against humanity""?"
"Blockchain is a profoundly important technological advance that could be the catalyst for a radical revolution against government regulated corporate controlled banking.

I think its success may have had the unintended consequence of making fundamentalist libertarian dogmatists think that their conspiratorial speculation is valid."
"Ugh, you sound like one of those obnoxious false equivalency types. You know, those guys who come into any dispute and act like everyone is equally at fault.

""On one hand, A did punch B in the face. But then B punched him back and even insulted him! In my infinite wisdom, I declare everyone at fault here.""

Real example: ""Ugh, it's so childish to keep arguing against Core. Just be quiet and make your own coin, k?""

Bitcoin Cash's existence is based on a critique of the direction taken by Core. Reinforcing this idea not only has no negative effect on its development, but is to be expected when its whole raison-d'etre is to avoid what Core has done. Bitcoin Cash supporters are allowed to reaffirm what they are against. It would be crazy not to.

Fortunately for everyone, your complete lack of understanding of fair play will not affect anything, so you can reverse your descent from heaven now, we're good."
Yeah what they've done is right up there with Mao, Stalin and Hitler /s
Blame the corporations that tried to destroy Bitcoin. We're almost finished stopping them and then it'll just be normal Bitcoin again. :)
You know who else wanted people to stick to the facts? Hitler
"Yeah, I sold all of my BCH and BTC. It feels like a bunch of kids squabbling over how to fix a Model T when we have Teslas. 2018 will be the year that ends BTC dominance, and BCH has no place in a world with coins like XRB and Stellar. Tech is moving too fast to be arguing about block size.

This is a really silly place."
">This battle will affect this planet in ways we cannot imagine for the rest of eternity

Jesus Christ, the kind of wide eyed hyperbolic shit you guys say on this sub is actually making me doubt the future of BCH. I'm 100% with you guys about BTC becoming more centralized, slower, and waaay too expensive to be viable. But you lose me when you act like this is some global conspiracy trying to enslave mankind. It's a greedy fucking corporation teaming up with various millionaires/billionares to make money. They are coopting bitcoin because they are greedy fucks, not because it's challenging their world domination conspiracy."
💯 
You know that people say the exact same thing about the crew behind Btrash, right?

Core stole the brand name just as much as Cash did. It doesn't inherently belong to either fork. You have to think for yourself about it.
"> I hope r/btc remain a BTC sub

But it IS a BTC sub - the pre-take over BTC."
There's nothing in particular about BCH (as opposed to BTC) that makes mining centralised in China. Anyone can mine anywhere in the world, but the reality is that mining tends to concentrate in places which have cheap electricity and industrial space for rent. This is an issue for both coins and is not an inherent disadvantage for one over the other.
"It is my largest concern, and I believe it applies to all coins that are not resistant to ASICs, Digibyte excepted, as it is a 5 algorithm coin and even 90% control of SHA-256 will not allow a 51% attack in the event the communists nationalize it.

I realize I talk about communist nationalization a lot, but only because it scares the shit out of me. They tend to *do* that... a lot."
"> Are u idiot ? How is that a crime against humanity ? Creating a shitcoin and trying to steal bitcoins name and brand is a crime .

Yes, BSCore created an unusable shitcoin. "
"It can't last forever.
The fact is all of pow coin including BTC, the mining power is dominated by Chinese miner.
LTC is more than 80%mining power in China, and BTC is more than 70%.
All of this are fact.
"
"Anyone can build and run ASICs if they want to, current miners: https://blockchain.info/pools. 

It could be more decentralized of course but who knows, there will possibly be new groups in the future that get into mining."
It is important to expose scam.
zillions of people have asics, that's not a bottleneck at all, the bottleneck is that everyone just points their asic at a pool out of laziness, it's easier to have someone else run the pool so the number of pools tends to dwindle, none of them technically have majority hashing power but that's just because we've artificially broken them up a bit so they don't so that's not quite right, no one in particular's fault though :)
"Sorry to disappoint, but I actually *do* believe that:

> Major change happens slowly. People thought the .com boom changed the rules; but the crash at the end of the last century proved that was not the case. Bitcoin proves that ""Know your customer"" laws are a human rights issue. The average person can possibly console themselves that they are not likely to run into the reporting limits (that are no longer actually hard limits).

> Bitcoin is also not ready for mass adoption. At an minimum, multi-party signatures have to be easy enough to use in a privacy-respecting way (meaning with a new address for every transaction). The network is still limited to about 7 transactions per second as well. If it goes ""big"" as-is: it will replace wire transfers, and not much else.

> It took the industrial revolution about 300-400 years to happen after the invention of the printing press made the dissemination of information cheap and efficient. The governments in power fought the change: inventing copyright law to slow the spread of information. The agricultural revolution probably took a similar amount of time, if not longer. The invention of networked computers will lead to the information revolution if we don't kill ourselves first. I don't expect it to complete in my life-time.  Sadly, many never learn the new technology. The old generations have to die off before truly revolutionary change is accepted.

> Bitcoin is a revolutionary experiment. It is the ""first secure networked application ever created in the history of computers."" (Out-of-context Bruce Schneier quote) Governments and banks will attack it through legal and technical means. It may only have a small niche over the next 50 years. If that happens, it will be OK: because it is just an experiment.

Crime against humanity isn't exactly hyperbole. Though maybe crime against society is more easily digestible for some.
"I don't understand this reasoning. Bitcoin (core) has the largest adoption in commerce by far. Infrastructure which everyone is now swapping in BCH on.

Which coin do you see replacing this infrastructure in the next years? Market value and price movements sure, but actual adoption and mass usage? Bitcoin has brand recognition and nine years worth of actual, battle-hardened experience. Just look at what happened to ether chain with cryptokitties, you couldn't even send slow transaction due to wallets/miner gaslimits.

And don't even bother mentioning some other coin which has 1-2 wallets written in visual basic which folds as soon as there 10 concurrent transactions... Alts are cool but very few have the testing and stability the bitcoin protocol has.

The _only_ other coin that is even close is ethereum, and it's far from as user-friendly as bitcoin (cash) is on the consumer level."
"Please forgive me if you describe *'bitcoin core developers are committing a crime against humanity for disagreeing with me about how large blocks should be'* as being *accurate*, and I describe that as *insane.*

That being said, if there was solid evidence, I'd change my mind."
"I've said for years that what worries me is that if this ""civil war"" keeps dragging on - other cryptos will overtake. Unfortunately, that's exactly what's going on. I find it so **ironic** that something like Ripple may overtake Bitcoin.

Theymos WITHOUT DOUBT did horrific things to stun Bitcoin growth. But what exactly are we gaining by repeating it over and over? I understand some people get satisfaction of seeing others finally share their views. But to outside audience all of us who participate just look crazy always talking about Theymos or Blockstream or sad moments from the past.

We only have so much energy to invest. I hope for Bitcoin's sake we invest that energy into growing economy and marketing rather than fighting injustices of the past."

It's not like people are trying to ""expose a conspiracy"" or some crap like that. All people are trying to do is **tell you the truth**, but a lot of people sadly can't be bothered to even click links when others are doing THEIR research for them..

Even when people like Cobra and Theymos in BLACK and WHITE say stuff like they do, I've still seen BlockstreamCore fanatics deny what they're saying and call people ""conspiracy crazy"" or something similar."
Right now we are a bit like a support group for ex cult members or victims of mental abuse.  But we will get over it eventually. The /r/btc community is slowly improving. At least here you don't blatantly get banned or your comments removed. Imagine a /r/soccer where you could only post about indoor soccer and most posts about outdoor soccer would get removed and when you protest you get banned. 
It won’t replace banks because of people like you who keep using them! But some of us don’t have any banks account anymore. You can pay everything in crypto with a crypto credit card. I barely use my bank account. 
"The title is 100% accurate.

Corporate banker hijackers infiltrated and took over the original media channels and the codebase using every dirty tactic they could, and still continue to do so. I don't see a problem in reminding newer people that this happened and continues to happen.

I don't really expect more recent investors to understand it or the history between /r/bitcoin and /r/btc, but pre-2013 Bitcoiners have every right to be upset about what happened, and have a definite vendetta against Blockstream and their cronies for what they did, which set the whole space back *years* and took away something we all *loved* before Bitcoin Cash started us back on the path we started on as the coin we originally invested in. "
It's certainly a huge problem in this sub, since there's no censorhips here and no astroturfing and no cheating the front page and bot voting this place doesn't have an appeal, you get to see reality for what it is.
"that you're being paid really does seem pretty plausible, you don't exhibit evidence of other motives

what other motive do you have, you're holding btc, or what"
It is comical 
"I think BItcoin specifically sees BCH as an attack.  It doesn’t help that it shares mining resources, and the social media attacks are going both ways.

BCH needs to play for the long game and become a version of bitcoin, not an adversary of bitcoin.  It already established itself and is gaining traction.  But as new people enter the crypto space they start in bitcoin.  And they see BCH not as an option, but as a threat to their current holdings.

Jihan Wu has the right approach.  Look at his stickied tweet."
"The whole reason i got into crypto was my admiration for Satoshi's system and the motivations to deploy it. I truly consider it a paradigm shifting gift to the world.

Core/Blockstream/whoever started a war against an opportunity to evolve/better humanity. If it was incompetence or greed doesn't matter; they really have no idea what they are messing with and they need to be brought down."
Yes, these types of posts seem more than a little unhinged.
I'm a cashier now or whatever we're called, but if it weren't for this type of post I'd have switched over much sooner. It does absolutely seem insane.
/r/btc is always covered in posts like these without any sources.

do you ever hear any of Blockstream's investors complaining about any lack of ROI?  i don't and this is after almost 4y of burning thru core dev salaries, hookers, and blow.  why do you think this is?
See AXA investing in Blockstream
"> I have a really, really hard time believing that.

I've been in the bitcoin space for 5 years. I've personally witnessed Andreas to an about face on his view of bitcoin and scaling.

Everyone has a price.

> Do you have any evidence for ""Blockstream wanting to keep banks in the mix""?

[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYHFrf5ci_g) video does a fantastic job laying out exactly how the banks have taken over bitcoin... via Blockstream, and Blockstreams hiring of the most prevalent core developers. 

LN will be centralized, it will include banks because LN nodes will *be* banks.... and having said that, this all hinges on LN actually coming into existence, which at this point is still extremely questionable.

I would also encourage you to exit the echochamber which is /r/bitcoin and do some heavy reading over at /r/btc. "
that is exactly what happened, and is happening with segwit and side chains
The evil miner coin pays the evil miners 1/3000th the fee per transaction.
The main point still stands. He's not a CEO of purse.io.
But the question is not what happens if China turns that hashpower off, the question is what happens if it uses it to doublespend
Because the intent is racist.  You Blockstream supporters use racism to promote hate and disdain and the tactic is utterly disgraceful.
Damn I love this sub.
Doesn't make sense since everyone would see this and it would make btc worthless so why bother to try? 
What happened? I just used it twice yesterday to go from bch to eth for their trading pairs and I had no problems. Had to wait maybe an hour at the most but it wasn't too bad
"I've had a few bad experiences; but it also has worked very well. IIRC, I think it was something like 3 transactions that got refunded hours later sans transaction fees, and 4 or 5 that went quite smoothly."
You are a retard if you jump to such conclusions. 
my first time ever sending crypto was through shapeshift — I got “refunded” $20 less than I sent, which was half of my transaction anyways -.-
Because you are the government and Bitcoin undermines your control so you want to destroy it?
You called out race, and now you are upset that someone called you out for it.
And you are a racist to write that crap you do with the intent to incite.  You certainly do not emphasize the ethnicity of the Blockstream people that controls Bitcoin.
I had exactly the same experience, it was frustrating losing such a large chunk for no reason.
What's weird to me is that they create plausible deniability around almost every other aspect of their North Corea moderation policy, but not the mod logs. Not only do they not mention it at all or just skirt the topic when it's mentioned, but it's the only thing they do that plausible deniability *can't* be created around...If anyone can tell me a legitimate, rational, believable reason to privatize mod logs that applies to /r/bitcoin and that isn't simply having something to hide, I'll tip you $10.
/r/Bitcoin has private mod logs? Well what did I expect... That sub is a joke. I left it when they made it impossible to talk about bigger blocks. They literally locked every thread that I was trying to have a conversation in around the subject. And since then it has only gone downhill.

To be honest the geographical centralization of mining power in China means that the Chinese state can confiscate it and destroy Bitcoin.

lol spam transactions xD
Honestly this is a great business strategy when you think about. Yes, you alienate some diehard Core supporters, but anyone dumb enough to believe the Core narrative part-and-parcel is more than likely going to be more trouble than their business is worth - and plus you'll attract a huge amount of business from BCH bulls and supporters.
That is only a problem due to the long time between difficulty adjustments.
Yes, and it's a bad thing. For optimal security, mining should be more distributed and diverse rather than concentrated in a particular nation-state (especially one with a track record of sporadic hostility to blockchain). Core has a good point in that minimizing (within reason) block size and other constraints on running a full node will help with this. But Core has been a bit extreme, since going up from 1mb to something less than 10mb would still leave plenty of  headroom re: who can run full nodes. But, anyhow, block size is not the main determinant of why there is concentrated mining in China--ASICs, mining pools and path dependence have a lot more to do with that. We need ASIC-proof mining methods (including maybe PoS) if we want to ensure that more miners from more places will always be in the game. But that's just not in the cards for bitcoin. 
No, it won't destroy Bitcoin, just Bcore.
AFAIK BCH readjust to 10minutes regardless of the hashpower.
He invested 55 million USD in Blockstream in February 2016. He should have just bought bitcoin.
I was hoping to see this comment here.
"> rbtc owned by Roger Ver

Define ""owned."" Roger did not create this sub, and while he is a mod, we have fully public mod logs for a reason - if he was using his mod privs to further an agenda, the entire community would easily be able to see that. Quite unlike the inexplicably private mod log of /r/bitcoin."
