"woof, this leads only to a dog turd

Buying bitcoin is what gives it value. If nobody buys it, then it is worthless, and the value being stored by your store-of-value is 0.
On another note I actually like the term Bcash. It roll off the tongue better than BitcoinCash. 
Turns out they only accept *bitcoin*, not BCH. They accept actual bitcoin, you guys know what I mean right, the coin with the highest market cap and largest number of users? Not the altcoin BCH that gets pumped and dumped every 3 months to keep hope alive. Did I lose anyone of you? Can you understand which coin yet? Are you going to send your BCH to your Purse account because they say accept bitcoin? lol
I suggest people in the US use bitcoin as intended , for regulatory arbitrage , using the principles of agorism. There is almost 0 chance the IRS can link private purchases with purse.io or elsewhere back to your identity.
If you use LIFO accounting and replace *before* spending, it can make sense and not cause tax liability issues. Although you’re still gonna end up having to track small purchases which is onerous.

"**Agorism**

Agorism is a libertarian social philosophy that advocates creating a society in which all relations between people are voluntary exchanges by means of counter-economics, thus engaging with aspects of peaceful revolution. It was first proposed by libertarian philosopher Samuel Edward Konkin III at two conferences, CounterCon I in October 1974 and CounterCon II in May 1975, both conferences organized by J. Neil Schulman.

"Nope you're absolutely right.  Segwit the 4x potential change doesn't solve the problem at scale.  To solve the problem at scale you need terabyte blocks.  Tell me how you're going to get terabyte blocks to run over TOR, or satellite, or a ham radio mesh net?   Graphene?  Most of those suggested improvements are already in Bitcoin before the fork.  

In order for Graphene to be viable you'd need to restrict the blocks ordering.  Miners wouldn't be able to ignore transactions.  Kind of defeats the ""free market"" narrative that Bitcoin Cash supporters are spouting on and on about.

"> Segwit doesn't reject any old transactions. You've got this wrong, sorry.

Invalid segwit transactions are valid under old block rules. They are not valid under new block rules.

An upgrade was needed on miners or else they'd risk mining invalid segwit transactions, and have their block dropped by other miners that'd reject the invalid segwit transaction. A segwit-unaware (older) miner could mine transactions that other miners would consider invalid.

Therefore, a previously valid transaction (and block) have become invalid, which is exactly what you were saying doesn't happen. Except it does."

"Ok I can see that you genuinely don't understand so  I'll give it one last go. A ""fork"" in the context of a blockchain is when there are two child blocks mined on top of the same parent block. That's it.

It can happen for lots of different reasons: two miners using the same consensus rules find a block at the same time; or one miner uses tightened consensus rules (a soft fork); or one miner uses loosened consensus rules (a hard fork).

Your description of a code repository fork is correct, but it is not the same thing as a blockchain fork. You can have a code fork without a blockchain fork, and likewise you can have a blockchain fork without a code fork. You can also have both a code fork and a blockchain fork, which is what happened (although not at the same time) with Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. "

I get that you are embarassed, but you really need to stop claiming a fork is what you eat with when we are talking about repos.  It makes you look really dumb.
"If you reduced maximum size to 500MB, you'd indeed soft-fork, since the previously valid block of 501MB became invalid, but nothing previously invalid became valid (which would be a hard fork).

SegWit and the like have to necessarily reject certain old transactions, otherwise no upgrade would be needed at all, as it'd mean all past transactions remain valid and all future transactions remain valid, which would mean no upgrade needed (unless you wanted to use the new functionality).

Since an upgrade WAS needed, especially due to nodes performing sybil attacks, it means that something had to change in regards to transaction validity."

"I checked again, and I'm still seeing the same figure.

From looking at https://cash.coin.dance/nodes, I think my node is probably not representative of the larger larger network. According to that site, ABC nodes are more popular that BUCash nodes, whereas my node sees the opposite - I'm connected to more BUCash nodes than ABC nodes. And, it looks like most BUCash nodes I'm connected to are upgraded to 1.3.0, whereas most ABC nodes I'm connected to are still on 0.16.2. So, perhaps the reason for our disparity is that for whatever reason BUCash node operators are more likely to upgrade, combined with the fact that I happen to connect to more BUCash nodes."

"Ignore the trolls. Yes, they have a choice to upgrade or not. But if they don't upgrade, they will receive a worthless coin and lose a lot of money.

"You're almost right. But a soft fork is usually more to do with blocks than transactions.

E. G. If my mining mode reduced maximum size of blocks to 500MB, that would be a soft fork. All previous transactions are still valid, nothing gets dropped. And if more than 51% of the network starts using my new rule, then all nodes would follow this chain (because soft forks are still valid under the old rules too).

Properly planned soft forks (like Segwit) do not need to reject any old transactions. "

1. The cap is not necessary to prevent spam, we already have coin-age for this which works very well.

"A soft-fork, by definition, is a fork where certain previously valid transactions are no longer valid. A soft-fork makes it so that an old client can't send new transactions, but can receive new blocks. Miners will be in direct competition, as if the new chain ever becomes longer it'll override the old chain (since it's shorter and the new chain is valid). It favors the upgrade, as the new chain will win unless the old chain has significantly more hashpower. Nodes on the new version will drop transactions made by clients on the old version.

A hard-fork, by definition, is a fork where certain previously invalid transactions become valid. A hard-fork makes it so that an old client can send transactions, but can't receive new blocks. Miners will be in direct competition, as if the old chain ever becomes longer it'll override the new chain (since it's shorter and the old chain is valid). It favors the current state, as the old chain will win unless the new chain has significantly more hashpower. Nodes on the old version will drop transactions made by clients on the new version.

Quite literally, the only difference between a soft-fork and a hard-fork is whether it's invalid transactions being made valid (hard-fork), or old transactions being made invalid (soft-fork).

If you do both (so that you actually split into two chains), it's generally also called a hard-fork, but it technically isn't, it's both a soft-fork and a hard-fork.

> Because that has never happened and there were many soft forks already.

Happened multiple times. BIP66, P2SH, BIP12, are just a few examples where miners would reject transactions that were previously valid, and non-mining nodes would silently drop them and not propagate them. If a miner mined a block, all the miners on the new version would ignore it if it wasn't the new version. All of those were contentious soft-forks that were upheld through a sybil attack that stopped miners from having their blocks propagated."
"Are you really calling people asking questions ""retarded"" ?  Wow.  "

The 8MB consensus limit (just like the 1MB limit of BTC) is *arbitrary*.  Removing it *does* optimize the code base.

There is no need for this
BCH IS TRASH, anyone who holds it is a fool or a scam artist.
can anybody explain to me why the bigger block size is happening? Its not like the current blocks are anywhere near to beeing full
so how does this affect the BCH I currently have and how do I get them on the new fork?
This upgrade will be really easy to roll out and have the miners agree on. Especially since the majority of mining pools are run by the same 3 groups. WAKE UP PEOPLE
but nobody uses our chain so why do we need to upgrade? Last block size was 20kB...
this will be fun.  bitcoin cash scamcoin led by liars, tax dodgers, and convicted felons can't fill 1 mb, but  32 mb is needed! lol.
who needs 32 when 8 is not even remotely close to being full?  
Are we tracking how many miners have updated? Is there any indication in the blocks?
What's the largest block mined so far?
Was 32MB satoshi's vision?
So as an outsider interested in BCH, what does a 32 mb block size mean?
I mean im all for it and +1 but are the blocks already filling up to the 8mb cap?
Is this the kind of fork that will double my BCH holdings? Like when btc forked and everyone then had equal amounts btc and bch?
