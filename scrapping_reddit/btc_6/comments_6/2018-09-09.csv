"The ICO craze seems over. And lots of them are outright scamms never to devliver the promised product.

As a currency BCH will prevail. Store of Value might be dead, but even at $1 = 1 BCH the trade can go on and on. Thinking of specialized markets hidden somewhere."
So. True.

"Market is king , and it is saying that it prefers Bitcoin over BCH

Asking the real questions.
"You come across like a trump supporter saying ""but what about her emails""."
Who? 
Amen Brother! 
God bless our CEO :P
"Yeah but Daniel Krawisz is the Emperor of Bitcoin. 

"
Bitcoin Cash has a CEO? wtf lol
So is the post saying that the central banks are manipulating the crypto community to fight itself?
I wonder who people think the king represents.
If you think security of a blockchain is important, there is no way in hell it will remain an usable currency at 1 BCH = $1.

Until the flippening, which is going to happen any day now.
"The market ""says"" nothing. It is not some mythological beast with it's own opinion. 

A high price does not mean that something is objectively that valuable in any other sense than that it is how it fits into the economic activity itself.

If you think differently, you didn't read your Austrian economists correct or perhaps at all."
Is she big on Tinder or something 
Don't worry, you'll know sooner or later. 
"Was that what I said? Nope.

You are confusing different values. Disagreement on price is why we have a market in the first place."
It will be very exciting to see what happens. Ultimately, that Bitcoin Cash still exists is a testament to how antifragile the design is. But if the hashpower dips too low, the network will certainly be a much riskier play.
Never heard of her
"Austrian economists don't think the market price of a good or service reflects the value of that good or service?

Please cite an example."
... I'm guessing you bought in during December.
"51% attacks and reorgs on BCH is the new definition of the flippening ;-)

More drama in November

"
"Chaos. There is a multi tiered level of sabotage against the hegemonic American power, that which was chosen to be the face of Globalization. Rome 2.0 if you will. 

That sabotage actually only exists to create instability leading up to the final war. "
Would that sound terribly unreasonable to you?
Oh jesus christ, he's a furry? He can be the emperor of Bitcoin-BTC, BCH is too innocent for animal abusers
You heard me. 
What...?
For now because most are still uneducated. I'm working on that.
Oh stop it. Be reasonable.
Here no one is king
">In a mob-rule world, the King is whomever is best at  ~~sockpuppeting~~ murdering and torturing.

FTFY. The state exists only due to its monopoly on violence.

"the king is not here to help you but to steal from you.

Once you understand that you realize that the bitcoin king are the central banks."

Welease Wodewick!!
nice
there is only one king...
"> Who do people think the Bitcoin king is?

Coingeek wants to be. There would at least be no lack of Queens if he succeeds."
The King is BTC.. pitchforks are xrp lovers and torches are bch supporters 
So it goes...
Who do people think the Bitcoin king is?
"The King are the narket manipulators and purveyors of fake news designed to drive the price down so the short positions can make a killing and rip us all off in the process. ETF? Ha, don't make me laugh. It will never happen.  The SEC recognise a cest pit of crime, blatant price manipulationand corruption when they see it.

It's time for the crypto space to close down the doors and nail on the shutters. It's all over boys. The good times are gone now. Only further manipulated price declines and more BS. The Whales and manipulators won. Let's face it...they scammed us and stole our money. Trade volumes us dead and people are mocking us for being so stupid to buy into this ponzi scheme. Warren Buffett. ..you were right along old man."
It is not only btc, it is everywhere in life
My favorite tactic in Risk.  
Cash is King. ðŸ˜Ž
Where are the /r/bitcoin public modlogs?? 
">Pretty amusing, and there's a glint of truth there... but the *real* insight is that there is no King in the first place.

In a mob-rule world, the King is whomever is best at  sockpuppeting."
I think the king can just symbolise anyone who wishes to see people fight among themselves. 
There isn't centralized development in BCH, but there sure as hell is in BTC. How about you go back to censoring all dissenting opinions in /r/Bitcoin and serving your king. These pathetic attempts at driving division in this community are obvious.
"Our CEO, Rick Falkvinge of course.

Jesus Christ is king
Bitcoin has no king, nor mob with pitchforks and torches. It did loose in value compared to ATH, but it lost smallest percentage in compare to others....so this is one large missed shot.....
"Haha Karma whoring and crisis management for Blockstream; tagged and tugged shill. "
"> (e.g. **Blockstream, AXA**, CSW, or Bitmain)

Cough cough.

Yeah no, don't try and divert from these being guilty.

"Pretty amusing, and there's a glint of truth there... but the *real* insight is that there is no King in the first place.

As humans, we naturally want to place the blame for any ugly phenomena onto some singular, targetable culprit (e.g. Blockstream, AXA, CSW, or Bitmain) but more often than not, the landscape is more complex and nuanced than that. And in all honesty, the nuance is the interesting part."
Generally it's the burning.
You sound like one of them torch people trying to take my pitchfork away...
Nice try :)
bnuance
It's clearly day in that drawing. Why would anyone have lit torches in the day? They don't last long, you wouldn't light them before you needed them for seeing or burning.
Nervous laughs, surely. 
20x past btc in a btc account?  Iâ€™m confused 
Weâ€™re not shills. Weâ€™re just here to laugh at you.
