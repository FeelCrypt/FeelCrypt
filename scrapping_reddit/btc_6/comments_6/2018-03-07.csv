"Yes.  Bill Gates did a recent AMA and one was about cryptocurrency in general.  And he basically said he’s not big on it, one of cryptocurrencies biggest draws, being anonymity, will be it’s biggest downfall if it goes big/mainstream.  Governments don’t want this and they ultimately control these things.  Sure they haven’t enforced anything yet because it’s all an experiment and still very early adaptation vs real world currency.

Ripple is an entirely different beast then most if not all cryptocurrencies.  So there’s definite possibilities but as you eleoquently put- still many hurdles and unknowns.  People here go way to crazy on the positive sausage rubbing button. It’s good to be positive but also discuss fundamentals, hurdles, etc to get a better picture and realistic idea of what to expect.

This is a copy pasta response from Bill Gates AMA when a user asked about his opinion on cryptocurrency (note, this is not ripple but cryptocurrencies in general- still relatable to an extent)

“The main feature of crypto currencies is their anonymity. I don't think this is a good thing. The Governments ability to find money laundering and tax evasion and terrorist funding is a good thing. Right now crypto currencies are used for buying fentanyl and other drugs so it is a rare technology that has caused deaths in a fairly direct way. I think the speculative wave around ICOs and crypto currencies is super risky for those who go long.”

Absolutely.  My meaning was in the transitional sense.
"But the point of this project is trustlessness.  Ideas should be weighed by merit, not who they come from, right?  As far as anyone knows, everyone here could be a greedy snake waiting for their moment to seize control.

Let's bring up CSW.  On second thought, I don't like him either, but some here do."
What im saying is dont let him gain any trust. I think most people have their head screwed on so its irrelevant in what im trying to say. But the more votes hey gets, the more power he has to stifle the network. (a miners decision)
"[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-stake#Criticism) explains why POS isn't all sunshine and rainbows as many people think.

>Some authors argue that proof of stake is not an ideal option for a distributed consensus protocol. One issue that can arise is the ""nothing-at-stake"" problem, wherein block generators have nothing to lose by voting for multiple blockchain histories, thereby preventing consensus from being achieved. Because unlike in proof-of-work systems, there is little cost to working on several chains, anyone can abuse this vulnerability by attempting to double spend ""for free"".

This problem is being worked on and POS may be the future. An example of this would be the Ethereum's [GHOST protocol](https://www.cryptocompare.com/coins/guides/what-is-the-ghost-protocol-for-ethereum/). But for now POW is really the only game in town. "
"> My main thought is, since he could just create an alternate account at any time and we would welcome that account with open arms, we are better off just welcoming the original account with open arms in the first place

That's actually a pretty enlightened way of looking at it. I can agree with that :)
"
"I read it as a guy /u/djstrike24 trying to talk over the person he was responding to /u/CJYP while ignoring the points made.  It seems like the mob/cultlike mentality is overriding rational sensibility in the progression of this particular thread.  ""Let's label the guy and ignore him forever"" seems a bit idiotic.  Especially in contrast to what was just stated beforehand.   "
"I was kind of trying to strengthen the first point with the other ones actually. I guess that didn't work :)

My main thought is, since he could just create an alternate account at any time and we would welcome that account with open arms, we are better off just welcoming the original account with open arms in the first place. We can be seen as a welcoming and forgiving community or a closed minded community, but we can't keep out someone who doesn't want to be kept out. Obviously we wouldn't be giving him a leadership position any time soon."

Your account is a few hours old. Welcome to Reddit. Hope you get paid well 
Why are you even here, commenting? It's not even a clever comment, so it's not like you're here to offer an alternate opinion.
Buuuuuuuuuuuuut my narrative!
"That’s completely the opposite of what I wrote, and it’s completely wrong. Many BCH (please grow the fuck up) fans are long-time Bitcoiners who probably know far more about it than you. 

They are also perfectly intelligent people who can see how completely obvious it is that the @Bitcoin account changed hands just before it’s sudden conversion to unflinching BCH support. But they are so invested in the “us vs. them” mentality that has come to define the fractured Bitcoin community that they don’t care how suspect things look. They just support whoever or whatever speaks in their favour and attack anyone and everyone who seems to be “against” them.

You are doing exactly the same thing with your stupid “BCash” comments. So congratulations on being part of the problem."

Right, supporters. Like, multiple people, or a crowd.
Yea and also BCH is worth less than BTC. It’s a cruel world out there man. 
True enough, though I feel so far that it is far more malice by mass manipulators gaming profit out of stupid people. 
I think you're correct. Look at how pro BTC people get down voted to hell here on this sub when they speak their opinion. The same is likely true on twitter but in the opposite supporting direction. 
"

Doesn’t have to be paid. They could just hold BTC and don’t want BCH to have the exposure so that their investments loses its worth.

I definitely think Blockstream pays a bunch of *people to do exactly what you just described, yes. 

It works because Twitter sucks

I don't find that cruel at all :)

Worse than r/bitcoin? I can't even post there at all. Yet here you are getting a response to your idiotic post.
You're fishing for the idea that bitcoin has a higher marketcap than bitcoin cash and that's supposed to make it better? It's always had a higher marketcap because it's always had the initial momentum. But look at bitcoin dominance, and it's below 50% these days. It was like 95% when I bought my first bitcoins. Bitcoin is in a slow decline for like 2 years now to altcoins. You whine about bitcoin cash, while ethereum eats your lunch. We told you bitcoin would lose markets share to other coins if you didn't raise the blocksize. Look who ended up being right about that.
I wasn’t trolling. Actually just misread your reply. My b man. Stop being so sensitive to anyone having a differing opinion

Bitcoin took off because it was useful.  If that utility declines it would be stupid to hold it.  Switch to something more useful and reliable before the masses do.
But you still said it....

Bitcoin Cash developers are going to reduce the block time and add more privacy features.  I think BCH has more support.  Its BCH I want to collect the most.

No one would have an issue at all if Bitcoin Cash just used their own handle (BCH/Bitcoin Cash). But no, the community is intent on thinking they know Satoshi's original vision better than anyone else with nonsensical logic.

I get it - everyone is your enemy.
Stop using Twitter, Facebook Google Youtube. They are nothing but intolerant political tyrants,
What I don't understand is why Twitter (and probably other social media companies aswell) don't put generally controversial accounts on some sort of no-autoban whitelist to only allow manual bans by Twitter admins. Abuse like this could be mitigated much faster.
What the actual fuck?
"The same thing happened to KuCoin as well apparently, either Twitter's anti-bot bots have a screw loose or their mods are going rogue. 

Twitter has become the Internet equivalent of dumpster juice. "
"There has been a lot of crypto spamming going on on twitter. A popular figure would post an update, and a bunch of bots would jump on it. One, using a similar name and a copy of their profile picture, would post a mesage basically saying, 'I'm also running a [coin] promotion. Send [x] to [address], and I'll send [10×[x]] back""; then a bunch of other bots would reply to it with 'Wow, that was fast! got 10x straight away! thanks!"". Then, more bots and hacked accounts would retweet these messages to keep them at the top.

After about a month of doing nothing, twitter is now overreacting by closing down real, known accounts - including accounts that were the victims of this garbage. 

In other words, standard, everyday twitter incompetence."

"You just **know** this is r|Bitcoin's fault, when they found out @Bitcoin began talking about the benefits of BCH they probably told everyone to report that account as ""hateful"" or something ridiculous.

People that support bch report bct and the other way. Sad to see the divide and rule here (who is behind that btw?).
It's funny because Core supporters heavily promote their stuff on Twitter.
@Bitcoin is a legitimate twitter user who has every right to post his thoughts and opinions, whether or not you agree with his opinions. Meanwhile, Twitter does absolutely nothing to stop fraudulent users who impersonate Roger Ver, Vitalik Buterin, or others, often for financial fraud by luring them into depositing BCH or ETH into their wallets.  Amazingly Twitter does not even allow you to report those impersonators as fraudulent, but meanwhile when an army of Blockstream's shills write in to complain about a legitimate twitter account, that account gets restricted.
It’s 💯 purposeful prior to the election.  At least we now have better correlation for normies.

Wait do you honestly think Twitter is being paid off by blockstream to block a couple twitter accounts? It’s obviously from people at r/bitcoin just mass reporting the account and twitter auto bans stuff with enough reports I’m assuming. I bet if you had enough minions you could get an account banned for a bit as well

Twitter and facebook and all these other social media platforms have gone completely way beyond full retard. Everyone knows you never go full retard. But they went above and beyond that.

This is an entire new low, though.  I was baffled/terrified when I started seeing those tweets with 500-5k likes that were obvious misspellings of big accounts or scams, but I'm beginning to realize it's a clear indicator that Twitter is just a platform for advertising and bots.
"> In other words, standard, everyday twitter incompetence.

That’s a bit harsh. By your own description, they have been inundated with scammers, hackers, and bots trying to manipulate their platform to extract financial gain from their users. 

They can either do nothing, watch this kind of activity skyrocket, and get accused by dumb users who lose money. Or they can take action, try to stamp out the activity, and piss off some legitimate users caught in the crossfire.

The activity surrounding the sudden resurrection of the @Bitcoin account and the complete conversion of its owner to be a true BCH believer was/is suspicious as fuck. The account *does* look like it was either bought or hacked from someone who wasn’t really using it anymore. Everyone here knows it, but they pretend not to because it supports their cause."

Based on your logic when I go shopping for airline tickets, paying $15.80 for a $200 ticket for ""storage"" in the most secure blockchain also isn't so bad since it's also 7.9%

It's clear you don't understand 7.9% is relative to the amount you purchase. Perhaps you need to learn that 7.9% of a $100 purchase is $7.90. Above that, I need to pay a government VAT tax of 6% which is cheaper than your useless ""storage"" fees of 7.9%."

Forever remains to be seen. But the point is, it's just 250 bytes. And who are you paying? I could take your 40c and switch off all my gear tomorrow.

"> percentage was a variable for fee caclculation while it's not is misleading

It's not misleading to express a fractional number as a percent.

1/2 = 2/4 = 50 / 100 = 50% all those ways of expressing the same value are objective and the same. Please look at the definition of objective again

> they are only doing it to help BCH

Why do you think this? Because they support other currencies than BTC? They are BITpay.

> For a large transactions the percentage is much lower than for a small. 

...which is why they are telling the user the fee value in percent?

"you have a point about there being a market for BTC even if BCH captures the entire market for smaller payments, but it's useless to talk about ""fair"""
"I will never accept Blockstream's wholesale theft of a project I invested a lot of my time and money into years ago, and anyone who supports them or anyone involved with them can go to hell.

The last time we tried to cooperate they pulled a bait and switch *for the third time* finally hijacking the Bitcoin name for their SegWit enabled altcoin.

They continue the war by still *continuously attacking and vilifying this sub and the greater community* with trolls and FUDbots 24 hours a day. We finally went off on our own and it is still happening. Why don't you ask them what they are so afraid of they must continue this attack despite basically getting everything they wanted? They are attacking, *we are defending*. Do you really think anyone here wants it to be this way? We had hoped by finally splitting that would be the end of it, but vile, petty people have kept it going. 

Sadly you're right about that last part. BTC and BCH are both heavily damaged by what happened and it may be that way forever. "
Have you tried asking Bitpay?
Yes they use Bitpay (at least in NL) but only BTC right now
">To 51% Bitcoin you need to convince two manufactures with one stream of income located in one jurisdiction to assist you.

So by your logic, BCH is incredibly insecure then? Since it has 10% of the hash rate of BTC, it's 10x easier to 51% attack?"
"The fee isn't 7.9% for every transaction, it's $0.40 for every transaction.

Why is this so hard to understand? "
Yeah, his teacher told me he was really bad at math. 
"You're missing that it costs the same amount of BTC to send $5, $500, or $50,000 of BTC.

The percentage Bitpay shows is relative to the current transaction, which in OP's screenshot is $5."
At 10% of Bitcoin's hash rate? No, it could be more easily 51% attacked.
7.9% vs 0%
" S T O R E O F D R A M A

"
The BTC/BCH fee itself isn't determined in percent. For example in paypal you pay x.x % of the amount. However, in Bitcoin that's not the case, so pretending percentage was a variable for fee caclculation while it's not is misleading and they are only doing it to help BCH. For a large transactions the percentage is much lower than for a small. 
Doesnt work today
Bitpay has added BCash!!! We must boycott them.
Unfortunately, I’m not in the loop on that.  Could possibly ask them directly, though.

This is significant news. BCH just continues to get more and more adoption.
How do they pay a fee to receive a deposit? 
"Excellent point, I tried to empty an old BTC wallet back in December and couldn't because of the backlog and cost of fees. If you're a miner in a pool, only capable of earning ""dust"" amounts, then you will have to sit on any rewards until you have enough to eclipse the trx fees. As you point out, this will discourage small miners and ultimately pool diversity.

I'm unfamiliar with the mining payout schemes, are the miner rewards collected in a custodial account until withdrawn, or are the amounts distributed immediately to the pool participants (which means eaten by fees)? "
"Plus if you follow good security practices and use cold storage, that can be another fee.

We tend to think of Bitcoin transactions as being an exchange of Bitcoin for goods or services but there's a whole lot of other perfectly reasonable (and even essential) uses for Bitcoin transactions that also depend on low fees."
Everybody is pro BCH, except for you. 
"How do you even use this thing? I used to use bitpay for everything with ease.  Now it is impossible to even load funds on it.  I've tried all of the shitty wallets it ""supports"" and none work..  I dont know why they changed this and dont just accept normal btc addresses anymore. Anyone know why they changed it?"
The numbers don't lie... The numbers don't show favorites... The numbers just show the truth. 
This is 5 days after my email service would have expired if I didn't pay by debit card or Bitpay/BTC. That's just bloody swell.. Thanks Bitpay
"It is still a bit more expensive but that's normal since they are running at 50% capacity and BCH is only doing like 100kb blocks right now. 

However the problem is not the higher fees per say, but that the BTC network becomes unreliable when it hits 400 000 tx per day. You have know idea if your tx will get in the next block unless you connect the highests possible fee to it. Because after you put your tx in, if everybody else that is trying to get in to the block then puts in a fee higher then yours ... you won't make the block. You don't control other people's fees so you cannot predict when your tx will be in a block. 

This only happens when blocks are full or close to full.  BCH does not have this problem and if it would do 400 000 tx per day it would still not have this problem because there is still room in every block for every tx. "
btc is still around 30x more expensive
Yeah, but it won't always be. It has had huge backlogs and fees before, and will do so again unless either everyone switches to LN or to other cryptocurrencies. And the latter is the easier and more reliable option. (don't start with me on LN being reliable, people are still losing funds trying to use it on mainnet)
