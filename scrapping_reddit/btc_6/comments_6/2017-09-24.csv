This is fucking amazing
Fair enough.
Don't people here also want Lighning network? How will the Bitcoin Cash implementation be better that we can love one L2 and hate another?
They are a few years old. They have bubbled up on this sub a few times.
The third world doesn't care about transaction fees. What is important to them is that they can continue to route the transactions of the wealthy that can afford them. To deprive them of nodes and leave the developed world with a slightly less resilient network would be the real injustice.
"> knows that we need L2.

I don't think anybody _knows_ this. I have seen no definitive evidence or argument. In fact, the evidence we have appears to suggest that we don't need a second layer.
"
There is no reason (technically speaking) to cripple Bitcoin to allow L2s. And every reason to let them atach themselves organially. 
L2 is a wide scope which includes but is not limited to implementations worthy of Rube Goldberg

">lol, fuck SegwitCoin!


FTFY."
That is your MO, that's why you seem to hate everything it stands for.
Why? Why can't you just let people use the chain they want? Oh because your chain is smaller and less secured by hash power you want to force others to think like you? You think everyone who doesn't agree is simply too stupid to see your way? Come on now don't be like that, live and let live. 
Lol, you will not like the [check your privilege, women empowerment conferences put on by BitFury](https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2017/08/04/blockchain-summit-examines-the-role-of-privilege-in-spreading-a-democratizing-technology/#4768fe507387).
"The fact that hysterical leftists whine about privilege and special pronouns doesn't negate the fact that actual oppression exists in parts of the world. Women being treated as legal chattel and not enjoying the same rights as men is actual oppression. Ellen Pao whining about sexism because her office wasn't in the ""power corridor"" is not in the same league. "
I *like* p2p decentralized money, that's why I use Bitcoin (cash) and not the legacy chain
You're in the wrong sub, /r/Bcash is where people discuss Bcash.
u mad?
Of course blockstreams policy is forcing you to.. would you pay $5 tx fee for a $6 transaction?
We shit on them because it's amusing. We're not sitting here boiling with rage.
I am honestly glad  there was no compromise. You only end up getting the worst of both worlds, and a deal with the devil is still a deal with the devil. Bitcoin Cash is the much better version of Bitcoin *thanks to* not compromising with Blockstream Core.
">But... but... but... you already got a hard fork, why don't you pa pa please leave poor Blockstream alone? 😢

Downvote and ignore all posts like this. They pop up in every single thread that has something negative to say about Bitcoin/Core. Blockstream wants us to shut up and go away, just like everyone they have censored. Nah, I'm good on that."

The battle is never over. First it was a battle to simply exist. Now it's a battle to win over market share.
Correct, now we just need to work for increase of the BCC/BTC price.
"It's a parody of ""serious issues."" C'mon!"
"$0.10 fee for $6 transaction will suffice.

But if you want to pay $5 thats your business, seems retarded though."

That’s now how it works. How many users did bitcoin have two months after its inception? How about BCH? BCH took all 8 years of bitcoin’s momentum and then “upgraded the coin” which tanked the market cap by 90%.
IMHO they are wrong! :-)

But... [that attempt at a druid beard](https://i.imgur.com/1FqBdvM.png) and condescending look is so very amusing."
Thanks for reminder. :)
Where was Bitcoin two months after its inception?  At $500 per coin like BCH?
The segwit boost has finally met reality
Out performing how? As it is Bitcoin has performed pretty badly. The tiny limit to transactions really hurts people when they want to buy, sell, or move Bitcoin.
The market is never done speaking.
">downvoting

Remember.  There's no such thing as downvoting here. It is all ""censorship by coordinated downvote attacks."" :)"
Almost all religions have oppression against women. At this point it's a hard bargain to ask all people who fight for women's rights to be atheists as well. It's not hypocritical

So.. thus you're forced to use LN for small tx in that scenario.

L2 enables some high frequency use cases that are infeasible currently (think algorithmic trading). If the goal of bitcoin is to replace the centralized financial systems, you accept that high frequency transactions are part of the future and you think that these use cases should be free of counterparty risk then Level2 transactions are the natural solution.

Layer 2 is cool, but it does not need segwit or a malleability fix like [we have been lied to about](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/722kqu/interesting_interview_from_ryan_x_charles_about/).  Also [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6qgngo/here_is_proof_that_segwit_is_not_needed_for/).

"""I am happy that we have a 1mb blocksize limit to keep bitcoin decentralized, all I have to do trust a blockchain service to watch the network and have a bidirectional lightning channel open with a hub that can censor my transactions and force KYC."""
"""I used to use cash... But then I realized it was easier to just store tokens mined by giant SHA-256 farms in China in addresses secured by elliptical cryptography private keys that I must take responsibility to secure against all hacking attempts and yet still never lose, and broadcast my signed transactions into a peer gossip network and hope that the fees I included incentivize one of those same mining farms to include them in their blocks of transactions when they search for the next nonce that will form a hash preimage below the current consensus difficulty target.""

""I used to use gold... But then I realized it was easier to use bank promises backed by loan repayment agreements denominated in central bank units whose value is determined by a central committee of political appointees redeemable for nothing but required for payment of taxes.""

Etc.

OP's point is probably not wrong, but it's easy to use confusing language to set up whatever strawman you like."

"Real life.  I used to use Bitcoin to sell my stickers for as little as $2 shipped.  The penny or zero transaction fees made this possible.

This should get stickied.. Or at least we should vote it to the top every couple of days. 
"I agree with the sentiment, but ... what's the point of these complaints now?

Hasn't r/btc got what it wanted?  A fork that is outside of Blockstream's control, without a 1MB cap?

Is there something else we're meant to be campaigning for?  Blockstream to just die?  All their (misguided) supporters to suddenly see the light?  Is that likely?"

i feel some of my emotions centralized at certain parts of my body. 
Seriously though... These are awesome. Great job.
funny! more more
"After learning more about Lightning Network...I can see how it's not really going to work. It's been pushed as this 0 fee transaction change but it's just depositing money into limbo (another layer). The payment channel transactions never hit the block chain until you commit the payment. Yes, it uses smart contracts but it seems a bit hacky to sort a problem out regarding fees.

You can never transact more than your direct contact have deposited. The 'network' will grow but with time however but it almost reminds me of Facebook social graph. This does mean the big boys like CoinBase could setup payment channels with massive deposits, which does mean it's centralised more so.

Once you submit the transaction to the blockchain, there's your fee right there. 

Let's not even get started in miners, which basically are required to keep the network up.
We've already seen miners switching between coins to gain maximum profit.

I understand why it's been done and the fact if you raise the block limit too high, again you have a problem with control...but something seems off to me."
funny because it's true

Guess building stuff is harder than you thought, huh? "
why couldn't core have simply compromised.....
"""I used to use cash... But then I realized it was easier...""

This one is actually true though. Because all the stuff that comes after is responsibility of a miner. A user doesn't have to worry about anything other than securing his/her private keys."
Thanks :)  But don't feel bad, as long as we have the 1MB cap Carlos, and Nadia will be able to run their full nodes, instead of it all being controlled by evil companies. /s (even though one transaction fee will be much more than the cost of a node).

"For remittances, you first paragraph *does* sound easier than using cash.

You are expected to declare large sums of money as you cross borders. If is is over ~$10,000 USD, it is subject to confiscation.

If Carlos uses a wire instead, each intermediate bank will take a cut. That means you never know the full fees ahead of time.

Yeah, Bitcoin is already a bit complex and a lot of us do quite a bit of work explaining it to newbs as it is. Making it even more complex, along with making sending example Bitcoin transactions an embarrassment has not been welcome.
psa: this is an anti Bitcoin subreddit
The beauty is that you can still make transactions on chain. No one is forcing you to use either SW or LN. Idiot.
