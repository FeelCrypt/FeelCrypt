Yeah because the poor in this world have computers, electricity, internet access, hard drive wallets  not to mention the time and knowledge to understand how the hell this all works. 
what kind of idiot puts their life savings in cryptocurrency??
The BCH shilling is such that I'm forever turned off to the idea that maybe it's better, maybe it's the real Bitcoin. It's everywhere. Your comment is extremely mild in comparison to what I see but damn. 
Sorry, man.  Don't know what to tell ya.
where did this quote come from?
Oh sweet, that way they don’t go to waste? Smart! And thanks! 
"can you substantiate this statement ""for every two independent validating nodes....""?"
funds held by banks in accounts in other countries. 
"you really meant ""herd"" not heard right? Damn autocorrect...."
I know a few people who are on coinbase and only buy ETH, BCH and LTC.  More than buy BTC for sure.
I think we can claim that one as adopting/finding something that was abandoned.
What does shapeshift allow you to do? 
Yes you can store them on jaxx. And yes you can either send them to an exchange from the app (bch fees are a penny or less) or use shapeshift in the app (which cost more but may be more convenient).
Isn't garlicoin a complete joke. It's the modern Dogecoin.
"They fixed maleability without a hard fork, that's incredible

If you had a better solution, why you don't proposed that?

BTW, Bitcoin Cash STILL has the maleability issue"
Part of it is fixed already. There is no issue, and you spell malleability wrong. 
Basically, Ive been doing faucets and I finally have enough to deposit the coins ive earned into a wallet. I would like to have an app that will show me how much ive made based on the current market price.. I use Jaxx but only for Dogecoin for some reason Jaxx doesnt seem very safe to me to hold BTC or other big coins like ETH, LTC etc... Does bitcoin.com ios wallet show how much i've made based on market kind of like Binance and some of the other apps?  I appreciate you helping me. Im still really new to Crypto
Banks aren't going anywhere, dreamer.  Better to be partners with them now then part of the resistance which will fail in getting mass adoption.
Interesting....I see people doing this.....thanks :)
Like he said you just need to check twitter, they‘re everywhere
Bitcoin Cash would become irrelevant if it doesn't ride on the coat tails of Bitcoin. As such, it's in BCH's best interest to continue a sustained and prolonged attack on Bitcoin, to draw a parallel and relevance from them. 
btc is a pain to move around right now. mine is just sitting waiting until it's functionally useful again :/
Fixing it with a rube goldberg machine is indeed a downgrade. Malleability can be fixed without segregating Bitcoin.

Coinbase is fine to start with buying BCH. Then move your coins to bitcoin.com ios wallet or jaxx is fine but paper wallets for bigger amounts. 
"You need to send a direct message to u/tippr with the following words:

withdraw


Balance will give you how much BCH you have.
Withdraw will ask you for an address to send your money to. You can download Bitcoin.com wallet to do this"
I don't know any bch supporter who is bothered or cares at all about coinbase using segwit.

Jaxx is fine for what your doing.
So I can use Jaxx to store my coins but what if I want to trade them for other coins? And is there a fee to move them from one place to another like that? 
go check Brians twitter page and notice how many times BTC news (BCH troll) has trolled on this thread. also notice how BCH fans are in panic in the thred. https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/951869357931425792

There's a bad advice duck? What happened to Advice Dog?
Is /r/btc anti BTC? I'm confused 
Now you're thinking smart, faggot.  Get rid of that worthless shitcoin.
Lol If i was holding bcash every time i saw a lightning network video I would be scared. Satoshis greatest vision was decentralization so bcash being completely centralized is nothing like the satoshis vision.

"Well.. they make good moneys out of BTC.. ;)"
Time to unsubscribe to r/btc and r/Bitcoin. You are all a waste of time. 
As an outsider with no skin in the game, it really does look like Core wants to destroy BTC. 
We don't care if they do. It doesn't help or hurt us.
"Who says bch people care?

The issue has always been pointing out the manipulation and outright lies of r/bitcoin. Even with Coinbase using segwit there would be a huge backlog in btc. Blockstream is using coinbase using segwit as a distraction, to keep people from actually discussing the problems with high fees and companies leaving btc."
Why do people use Coinbase over Bittrex or Binance or Jaxx?

Go and check Brian's Twitter message confirming his team is now working on batching btc transaction and segwit implementation and then count how many times BCH Twitter account trolls on that thread also notice how many BCH fanboys panicked.
"[this may help](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvpD3iF9DCA)

Bitcoin split back in August into two coins, a SegWit fork and a big-block fork, as the Bitcoin community had already been split for a long time. There are people on both sides believing their fork is the real Bitcoin and the other represents a hijacking of Bitcoin. The moderator of r\/bitcoin is aligned with Blockstream and had banned big-block supporters from that subreddit long before the eventual August split, which means big-block supporting views are overrepresented here in r\/btc, while the opposite view is the only one represented/permitted in r\/bitcoin.

Because the SegWit fork has the BTC ticker name (""BCH"" being the other fork), **""BTC"" is often used in r\/btc as a shorthand for the SegWit fork**, and the opinion that it's a small-block hijacking of Bitcoin is common in r\/btc. This fork doesn't work well at the moment because it hasn't scaled well (because small-blocks), but rather than acknowledge it has a problem, its proponents are pretending it's just because an exchange  - Coinbase - hasn't implemented all of the scaling that SegWit allows yet. The Malicious Advice Mallard ribs people calling for a Coinbase boycott / saying Coinbase is why their fork is in trouble, but if you interpret it as a ""bad advice duck"" then..."
It's not an attack, it's a fantastic demonstration of the community using its governance mechanism
"Be prepared for what? The funniest part is that you are digging your own grave with that stuff. Waiting for LN is the worst strategy to beat other coins. 

Mostly, Bitcoin Cash shares the same hash power.  Once it will lead, about 1 year from here: BTC will be a dead chain. The other way around is not true. BCH can survive being the minority chain.

I hope you understand this and invest in something that is not doomed to fail."
"Eat a bit 

1 bit u/tippr"
So if you are decentralized, why complain about a single business not accepting Segwit? Obviously you are centralized now, and LN will increase this extremely.
lightning doesn't have space on Core's chain, and how does it enable payments when it's a store of value? lol
"You think Lightning can't or won't be done on bitcoincash too? You're fooling yourself.

Everytime you see full-blocks and >$1 transaction fees on BTC you should be scared of Bitcoincash.

Oh wait, that's been the new normal for more than two-months now with no sign it's ever going to change."
**If I were**
"With atomic swaps and side chains it won't matter even if they blacklist *said* privacy coin. The politics are dumb when the solution is right in front of us.

That's not what this is for. Any trading pair involving BCH added to GDAX is a huge deal. 
Helps with decoupling.  Traders make the market.

Yes that is the green looks bold and “cash-like.”
This shade if green seems closer to fiat. That's why it seems more money and I like it. But at the same time, I don't like giving tribute to dirty fiat as money.
"Imo that's far too dark and doesn't catch my eye in a positive way. A sharper green like in this post or the other example posted is superior in so many ways.

Still, green signals greenbacks, which is not the most appealing either."

Form over function :-(
That's the green the people want.
We want to differentiate in case of black and white color schemes. Saw black and white upward B used on the new Coinex exchange already.
I don't think so. I prefer the green that Coinbase is using. This one: #8dc451
It's what they crave.
It’s the green they deserve.
Not everyone is American
I was thinking this. With most films being American (at least the ones shown in  the UK) it's almost impossible not to associate green with money.
I hate that dark green. I lrefer something brighter
Not from USA. Can confirm.

In Canada the word green means something different than $20. In Canada. Can confirm.

"No but the USD is king of forex even outside of the US. It is a stable currency and the base of the largest market in the world and the sole military superpower. It is known for being green.

...Less green than it actually is in point of fact, now that tens are beige, 50s are a bit pink, and 100s are almost blue. But we still have more of a general color preference than most of the world.

You tipped 1 BTC (13k USD)
Plus having a color that looks like something you'd see on currency could help people make better associations with BCH as a currency.

French Canadian here, I associate green with money due to seeing to many comics, tv shows like Bugs Bunny, and movies where green is associated with money."

"And you know this for a fact I suppose. 

Edit: For clearification, I'm referring to U.S dollars here. Debt free or not really, but not money from any particular era, just a national currency from a particular area.

I like this green a lot, it's very refreshing and appealing. CMC should put this logo instead of that ugly small logo with the rectangular shape.

Not sure if this qualifies as settled already but...: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoincash/comments/7q5e33/please_take_time_here_to_appreciate/
The color is a bit off, but I like the ring very much.
I like green, but a little darker.  I also prefer the rectangle version like a paper money.  Cash.  Better than a coin.
"The tilting looks very bad next to the logo which is italic text.

Why add tilting if it's already so much different to the ""other"" chain?"
Could use a darker green

You need to use the green of a dollar, so people will subconsciously associate it with usd
yes green is too bright, but otherwise it's good.
THe color off, the real bitcoin should be the original color
I don't think the green is too bright but everyone sees things differently
For your consideration: B tilted to the left looks odd. It is regressive/tilted backwards. Upright would be better. Or even tilted right like original Bitcoin?
I am missing the rectangle around it. It made it look like paper cash. Which is better to differentiate from other crypto coins. 
I'll allow it

When it scales down what happens to the white pixels? Does the inner ring degrade gracefully or turn into white mush?
I like this shade of green but it looks a bit “thin.” I think a darker bolder green would  be better.

My personal preference is Coinbase's green - it is less bright.

Coinbase Green: The hexadecimal color #8dc451 has RGB values of R:141, G:196, B:81."
Maybe choose a green that is roughly the same in RGB as it is in CMYK so that when it's printed you get the result you're expecting?

While I'm not entirely comfortable with green being used at all, this one certainly looks  a lot better than the darker color suggested due to the hex.

I like the idea of the backing rectangle .. to make it clearly different for users.

Your green is better. The ring is good. 
That green is too bright in my opinion 
I think you're right. I had the intention of actually color picking from another popular green BCH logo, but forget to do that before I posted. I'll have a couple of more designs with adjusted colors to show off in a future post. Thanks!
"Sure. Agree with that. There's no mention of color in the white paper as that would be pretty irrelevant technically. 

Right now we just need a name to make sure we differentiate from Bitcoin Segwit/Lightning and also a logo design that's not too similar to the still unofficial Bitcoin logo that they use. In the future, we might go back to something else."

"I don't get it. Bitcoin Cash is supposed to be the real bitcoin, so why do we want to change the color to something different.

I think it would look better if it was a more catchy orange.

"Better, this would it make a better investment. With lightning network coming it is time for bch to stop the fight. Sorry but decentralization is just to valueable for money. We need it. Its the only thing that can beat regulations. Bitcoin Core will never die. Its the place of wealth.

Also some personal investment advice:
Don't pick a side, bch or btc. Buy at least 60% of the money you choose to invest in btc+bch in bitcoin core. Maybe 80-90% in btc if you believe in the core way of things. If you believe in the BCH way of things, just 60%. Then you make your own investments choicements but it has a better chance of winning. We're still in a market and money will flow to the ones that understand markets."
As per graphic art - I agree with many regarding to bright green. But my concern is not a colour or ring in ring or the angle of left-leaning.... I am new on reddit and tell me veterans, why so many BCH topics are fed into r/btc channel? Should not this be discussed on r/bitcoincache or r/bch channel? Excuse me, but shouldn’t  you collect your “Arts of Rings” and go to appropriate place to exhibit it?
Green is a sign of the old ways of monetary system and orange is the new green. How about BCASH just comes up with their own freaking Logo instead of copying the original BTC one?
I think you have waaaay too much time on your hands and are looking for validation on a graphic you added a circle too...
Good.

"Yes, I'm talking about the same Satoshi who wrote the whitepaper.

It's more of a description than a definition, and this little civil war is evidence that it's apparently open to interpretation.

That is, clearly, debatable.

And yes, I'm aware that it wasn't originally called Bitcoin Core. I chose to use the current name exclusively to avoid confusion. I appreciate the footnote for further clarity, thank you."

Bitcoin is now beat on every metric except price.  What happens next....
You're right. Ethereum processes by far the highest number of transactions as well though.
Ha, all those downvotes for nothing! Perfectly reasonable!
It's not that surprising. Market cap and marketing are removed quite significantly from verifiable adoption metrics.
Network effects and first mover advantages mean that Ethereum may be the go-to smart contract chain even if BCH is technically better.
It's not a brigade, I clicked on this link from /r/btc you moron. I like both coins, I hold both. Get your head out of your ass lmao.
like fuckin clockwork
Ethereum processes the most transactions by a large margin as well. I think the combination of those metrics is important.
Any idea what will get pumped? BTC?
"i dont know..

i started using ethereum about a year ago intensively. Now I see a realy degraded performance from it. Transfers used to be almost instant with a tiny fee. Today, I waited about 5 mins for a confirm with 50000 gas (up from the standard 21000).

Ethereum is great don't get me wrong but it is crumbling under the pressure it is under. POS and sharding need to come fast..

"
Doge coin has 1m block before Etherum existed.  Dash can process transactions in 0.3 seconds with Instant send.  And both of those networks could support more tx's than the ethereum network, Dash because masternodes are incentivised to do so and Doge because the tx's are smaller.  Smart contracts are great but add cost to a high cost system, in any case bitcoin has rookstock, and Mike hearn wrote the whole Lighthouse platform 3 years ago on the bitcoin network.
Because they are more complex transactions = more data.    It is revealing that they seem to be struggling so much with POS, which frankly to me looks like a backwards step, but that is matter of opinion.  It will be interesting to see how the relationship with ETC plays that are staying POW.  We know where all the miners are going to go.
"According to this chart the ETH blockchain is growing about 20x's as fast to process 3 times the tx's.

"
"I did not know that, thank you.  So could I pay someone I have no relationship with with that type of transaction?
"
"How is it set mathematically is the future is yet to be decided by people? 

It's central planing, just like with FED. "
If ETH hits top spot, why would the market flip to BCH and not ETH instead?
"The difference is that the Fed randomly decides inflation, where in Ethereum it is set mathematically, just like Bitcoin.

It's your choice to buy whatever you want. Just ensure it's based on a factual evaluation rather than hearsay narrative."
"1 gb is next.

we don't want you to run a non mining node, so don't worry. If you like running a node altruistically, go run the legacy chain. "
"Why?  Even if only miners ran full nodes it would still be decentralized.  And non mining nodes don't help with decentralization anyway.

I also saw an ad recently for a 12tb hard drive.  That should hold a decade of completely full large blocks."
"Why not? The bull-run has ended. Time to cash out and wait for the correction.

Ripple is still correcting in my opinion. "
"Sometimes the stupidity, lack of logic and reason of the average investor scares me.

Like, am I really so much smarter, or am I missing something?

It seems so simple, there are numerous metrics, showing that Ethereum is leading by orders of magnitude, that Ethereum still has tremendous potential for growth...

Yet, people are out there chasing Cardanos and Trons."
Playing the devil's advocate here: someone could argue that the value is less important than the number of txs? In the end it's a cryptocurrency that should be used for a lot of small txs and not only to transfer larger sums?
"1.this metric disproportionally measures what the most richest addresses are doing and this is not particularly important to mass adoption which I consider the most important metric by far.

2.if a person were so inclined this would be super cheap to manipulate if you have like a significant amount of ETH. Say I have 1000 ETH, I can pay .5$ to send this every 3-4 minutes and generate ""traffic"" of 411 thousand ETH/ about 550 million a day for the cost of 200$, If bitinfo takes such ""exploits"" into account (like certain meansurements of bitcoin used to do) then consider point 2 void.



(BTW I think ETH is vastly superior to BTC in every relevant way)"
By the way: eth classic is on the chart but not iota? I'm surprised.
BCH is turing complete and opening Opcodes in May rendering Ethereum obsolete. Check your facts.

"Yea seriously. 

A more logical (and likely) scenario is that ETH will take dominance in the next two months. Then through sheer adoption superiority and by aborbing the market share and hash rate of BTC - BCH will slide into that top slot. It's going to be most of the year before that happens, but it seems inevitable with the information we have now. Just my two bits."
"How do you figure it adds little innovation? It has ~30x shorter block times, while being able to process more transactions than any other current chain, and supporting entire additional token systems on top of it.

That seems like a pretty large amount of innovation."
"> Ethereum ... transactions are 5 times the size. 

Really? I wasn't aware of that.  Why?

I disagree that Ethereum is ""little innovation"". Specially if they manage to go PoS. But I agree that Bitcoin would be much greater today had it been allowed to grow. 

"
"> transactions are 5 times the size

Where did you get that information?

I don't know, but just checked some raw transaction data from etherscan.io and blockchain.info. Simple payment transactions on Ethereum seems to take significantly less space. This seems to be a natural trade-off of Bitcoin's UTXO system.
"
">Ethereum is going to hit a physical barrier for payments much sooner than a simple payment network because the transactions are 5 times the size. 

You are comparing smart contracts to payments. Direct eth transactions take 110 bytes because there's no public key and no change address. "
Good to know. Thanks.
"oh absolutely, especially if you ignore xrp which imo should be done as it is in a different category.

I dislike maximalism and I think stuff like bch, xlm, privacycoins (xmr, zec) and even DPOS-plattforms have very valid niches ( for now). However I am kind of a ETH maximalist in the long term :p, considering its roadmap for starting to compete with those niches, the amount of devs and the already existing userbase. 

"
"Yes, and BCH will grow like crazy once BitPay and other payment processors and more exchanges add it.

It was easy for ETH to out compete crippled BTC, the upcoming battle between ETH and BCH will be much more interesting

"
Stfu idiot. OP is a well known troll who is well known for using vote manipulation bots. 
Average transaction fee right now for ETH is $4.00. 
Yes
I won't go through the futile endeavour of trying to convince a conspiracy theorist with facts. Good luck.
I do think that, yes. My estimate is that Casper will deprecate proof of work. There is no excuse for maintaining an inherently wasteful system in the face of an alternative that retains the properties of proof of work without said waste.
Not accurate at all. Check eth gas station. One transaction is currently costing about 7 gwei for the safe minimum amount of an under 60 minute verification, which is about $0.20. The network has regained its stability.
BCH tx fee has always been a fraction of a dollar
Thanks, very interesting.
":)

That's all i needed to hear, my friend "
It remains to be seen if POS is as secure as POW. It will be an interesting large scale beta test for ETH to switch to that, good luck.
But even then, bch fees are 0.0001 of a cent. To a person not living in a first world country the $0.20 difference is a lot.
It works because public key can be extracted from the signature, and if you have a public key you can compute the originating address. So of these three only the signature is transmitted and the remaining two are inferred. 
Yes, the transition will happen very gradually for that reason, moving over hybrid PoW/PoS first. I think exciting times are ahead. Can't wait to have a general purpose blockchain that is environmentally friendly and unbound by geopolitics.
Oh im not disputing the cost of a bch tx fee those are fine im just noting that ethereum has corrected itself and is back to a much more tolerable level.
I was just reading something to that effect.  Thanks again.
"Sounds complicated, like The DAO which was exploited (and forked to return the funds), and the Parity wallet created by a Ethereum co founder where a teenager poking around accidentally froze $300 million of Parity's users funds - that are still frozen right?

Myself, I like secure bug free currency (with additional opcodes on the way, maybe MAST). 

There's no geopolitical issues in BCH, you have us confused with another coin."
"So you think ETH switching from POW to POS is a great idea then?

BCH development has just started, the block size increase was only the beginning and a single aspect of its scaling and other plans. "
"> First of all, fixed cap does not matter, inflationary rate does.

I believe I heard FED chairman or somebody like that trying to sell exactly the same shit :)

Whatever you want to call it, my friend.
I'm still not buying this shit. Nobody knows how much Ether is there going to be at the end - that's the only thing we know about further Ether supply "
"I think Ethereum is closer to what I had thought Bitcoin would have become at this point, but I dislike the gangrenous wound analogy. It would apply to the current political state of Bitcoin, but the difference is not enormous from a technological standpoint.

The design choices between ETH and BCH are bound to be different though, which is what would make such a competition interesting and useful.
"
So I could send you money using 110 bytes of data knowing nothing about you (assuming max efficiency)?
" It's anyone's guess.  Let's watch it -- pumps should start in the coming hours.
"
Transaction fees. 
ETH still have a governance issue to get solved as a long term currency. ETH is currently under Vitalik's leadership and he is a great leader. But what's next? A BTC style governance crisis? ETH governance is as centralised as BTC right now.
">Today, I waited about 5 mins for a confirm with 50000 gas (up from the standard 21000).

That's not how ethereum works. You need to increase the gas price, not the gas limit. Increasing the gas limit makes it LESS likely for your transaction to get confirmed. "
"I agree with you.

Also try to run a full node.  I double tucan dare you.

It'll melt your computer.
"
"PoS allows for much more security for a minuscule fraction of the cost.

I was thinking on the transactions that only move money around. They don't need to be more complex. Are they?"
"That doesn't say much without comparing what the transactions actually are. For p2p payments, Ethereum transactions cost less storage.

If you can compare the cost of a simple batch transaction contract to a multiple-output Bitcoin batch transaction, that would be helpful as well (in figuring out which system is best for ""payments only"").

For complex contracts, it is apples to oranges. For instance, something like a decentralized exchange or a stable coin is currently not possible on Bitcoin, so adding the cost of such transactions to the comparison does not make much sense.

Not saying this to be in favor of Ethereum, but facts are facts. If your argument were about the fact that p2p transactions need to compete with other contracts in order to be included in a block, then I think it is an important point to consider when building a payment system.
"
What do you mean by relationship? You need their address but that's it. 
It's indeed still in development. But any such change occurs through a hard fork, which I'm sure you know needs to get accepted by the broad market, and cannot be enforced by a centralized entity.
Ripple processes only around 2% of the value Ethereum processes, so you can safely assume that its transaction count is heavily inflated. It's a barely used, highly centralized network with a carefully constructed marketing narrative, but lacking the utility metrics to support that facade.
I know this might not be the sub for this opinion, but I personally consider Bitcoin and all of its forks and clones dead ends. They're years behind the curve. A blocksize increase is merely a bandaid on a large, gangrenous wound at this point.
Proof?
"ETH runs a system of emergent consensus AFAIK. So, if fees are high, it's because the majority of miners are deliberately limiting the gas limit.

BCH intends to be a system of emergent consensus as well. It would be vulnerable to the same problem."
As I said a matter of opinion, I think POS wont work out well in the long run but time will tell.  I am not sure about payment tx's on the  ethereum network, I suspect they are still substantially larger as the instructions set is larger.
"> For p2p payments, Ethereum transactions cost less storage.

If this is true it is something I did not know and important and iinteresting."
"Yeah, right. I've seen this 'broad market' in action. It isn't any different from the broad market of American corporations or any other financial oligarchy. 

They're gonna do whatever it takes to multiply their profits - that's the only thing we can be sure about, when it comes to the future of ethereum.

And if someone uses the 'mathematics' against them, they will just hard fork that guy away. :) "
Lmao. Big blocks will make the chain so big that it will be impossible to keep storing the entire chain decentralized. Maybe 2mb would have been feasible, but 8...lol...what's next?
"Interesting bit on the Turing complete part. I did not know that. I need to check on a few more sources but preliminary search checks out.

I wouldn't say this makes Ethereum obsolete though... C#, Python, Java, and Basic are Turing complete. None of them are obsolete, they just have different niches."
No, this doesn't even include token transactions. Possibly the fees of those transactions may be included, but that should barely change the chart.
ETH is the real bitcoin
That's not what this chart is about. Work on your reading comprehension.
Shouldn't BCH be doing a lot better for transacting? ETH is a smart contract platform, it isn't optimized to be a currency.
">""ethtard""

>not hating on eth

k"
Username checks out.
"Ethereum has more use cases than BTC and BCH combined.

BCH is striving to do one thing, really really well - peer to peer electronic cash.

Ethereum isn't bad at that, either. Plus it has way more potential for smart contracts.

I think a peer to peer electronic cash is a big enough problem to have a dedicated chain. But Ethereum is by no means useless. I think it deserves a lot of respect.

"
Trading related is no doubt a large share. Not trading itself though, as that happens largely off-chain on exchanges. Decentralized exchange (EtherDelta) is also a big one. General value transfer as well. It's hard to quickly get a complete overview of the activity to be honest.
Never use pie charts for this kind of data. Use a bar chart instead. 
I propose a BCH-ETH alliance: we take their non-smart contract transactions and get a big boost in transaction volume - maybe even surpass BTC and they get a relief from their 90-100% fullness of blockchain space and postpone their scaling issues until PoS is ready. It's a win-win!
Ethereum processes over 50x the USD value of Ripple, and 4-5x as many transactions as Bitcoin. Yet its market cap is only half that of Bitcoin. I don't think selling is what you want to be doing here, but to each their own.

"First of all, fixed cap does not matter, inflationary rate does. Ethereum is very similar to Bitcoin in that regard and will even be more deflationary towards the transition to Casper (proof of stake). Bitcoin will be inflationary well into the 22nd century too, if it still even meaningfully exists by that time.

Second, all XRP have already been created instantly by Ripple. They're still holding 60-80% of the total supply. It's pretty much a white collar scam in my book."

Also, BCH has had a higher number than LTC for about a week now.

Edit: I think the discrepancy may be because the line chart is what gets accepted into blocks, but the pie chart may be transactions hitting the mempool. Not sure but it is a hypothesis.

Value transferred on-chain the least important metric? Please elaborate.
How much of this is people using etherium as a cheap transfer tool to move between exchanges?  
I tend to be an optimist but this seems a bit too optimistic for me.
Why the rush?
"The ETH network is doing great.

Im an ETH/BCH supporter. Lightning and the Thunda."
"Ethereum adds little to the the innovation of bitcoin, a simpler scripting language is great, and I am sure in 100 years there will be an Ethereum like world computer.  Ethereum is going to hit a physical barrier for payments much sooner than a simple payment network because the transactions are 5 times the size. 

It it had been allowed grow Bitcoin could have already started to revolutionise payments and money around the world.  If the bitcoin network was physically growing as fast as the Ethereum network it would be processing 50 tx per second today."
What the actual fuck?  You're right.. I feel duped.  Unless the ETH data is missing something like the tokens built on top of ETH?
Newbie question, please don't kill me: what are they processing, exactly? Is this just trading? Cryptokitties? I don't know of any merchants who accept ETH...
Wow, hail the new king! Soon...

tragic for legacy bitcoin, good for ethereum 
I think it's _everything_ on the ethereum blockchain. So ETH + all of the tokens
"Tragic.

Thank god for Bitcoin -  Cash."
the performance is severly degraded from even half a year ago. 
I can confirm I paid for a year subscription with bitcoin cash. Was fast and easy.

"It's ran by Rick Falkvinge, one of the founders of the pirate party and one of the earliest people to fully understand the implications of Bitcoin.

He had publicly announced that if Private Internet Access was ever coerced in any way to start recording user activity he would dissolve the company. "

"They say they don't keep any logs, which seems to be true as they have been requested by US courts and thet couldn't provide them. I think they are trustable.

My suggestion is to get Bitcoin Cash from an ATM and use those anonymous coins exclusively for transactions that don't get tied to your identity (such as paying for a VPN)."
"After the court case where they presented they don't log PIA will definitely attract criminals. The feds aren't stupid. I'm almost completely sure they are under gag order. 

...and yes, I do help out with a different VPN service. We don't make any profit by talking about PIA this way. 


I agree with the VPN review sites also. Want to know why Mullvad and ovpn.se aren't on 'em? Because they are good companies. Services on those sites are usually paying the reviewers big $$$."
Which VPN do you use and how do you establish which service to opt for?
If you use your VPN for anything more serious than the occasional piracy I'm not sure if I want it to happen out of sight from government scrutiny. If you're doing stuff that gets you on the government watchlist it probably helps if the government can actually see what you're up to so that they won't have to turn to more invasive measures.
"> If you find your VPN on any sort of ""review/compare"" (LOL) website, then think twice before subscribing. 

Yeah I only use VPNs no one has ever heard of. :rolleyes:"
I use it as a layer of protection while on untrusted networks. Starbucks doesn't need access to my code. Motel6 doesn't need my reddit password. Does it suck that the US government might be looking at my traffic? Yes. But they're not the threat I'm worried about.

"I speculate that there's a race of invisible super-intelligent lobsters who have technology to thwart any humans discovering them, and they have a secret base on the moon.

There's no way of *dis*proving this though."
"Is this supposed to be the ""something spectacular""? If so I am so underwhelmed, not even a little wet."
That's entirely speculation, based on what, that they're popular?
"I'm speculating they may be under a gag order.

I guess I wasn't clear, they probably don't want to log, but the government might be forcing them. 

There is no way of proving this though."
"Random unrelated facts do not make a solid argument. You have absolutely no basis for the conclusion you're drawing. In fact you're using the point of evidence against your argument -- that they've been to court and told the court they had no logs to give -- as evidence that they do log.  Which makes even less sense.

You are right that we have no way of verifying whether or not they log. But that's true for all VPN providers. There are no anonymous VPNs because that's not possible with how VPNs work. If you want anonymity, you use Tor.  But this idea that somehow PIA is less safe than other VPNs is unfounded.  I don't mind warning people that VPNs aren't anonymous, but I do mind bad logic and baseless fear mongering."

Well I certainly think house pricing should be included in the inflation calculation index.

That’s actually the opposite of inflation dude
....thats not how inflation works
Thank you
Interesting, thank you. There seems to be a lot of interest in it lately especially. Should I be worried about the servers becoming crowded and the connection becoming slow? Thinking of buying a year supply. Thank you!
I thought socks was just for the tracker connection? Doesn't that still leak your IP to peers?
Thanks, ya I have used ExpressVPN before but it can be incredibly slow at times.
Those are honeypots too. Get real. I only use VPNs that *I've* never heard of.
"I know! I'm happy they take BCH now. But I was devastated to read that message when I was a customer... so I moved to AirVPN and paid by BCH there!

If they are that easily misled to the point they make a blog post about it... I dunno... If they would have just shut up and let the market play out.... Where is their Bitcoin Core full node? Obviously economics wins the day ,and if they want people to part with their (Bitcoin)Cash then they have to use the better technology."

Pia are smart operators
"I’d be interested to know how many (if any) payments they’ve had in BTC in the past year. 

OPs payment alone probably pushes BCH ahead in sales already. With all of the speculative money coming into crypto and the price fluctuation and the HODL memes it’s amazing crypto is being used as a currency at all."
Did they take it directly or thru a payment processor?
"BCH is a winner.

It’s not a race it’s a marathon at the moment."
Thanks. Just got a year sub!

Woo!"

Can't wait for Perfect Privacy VPN to start accepting BCH too
Cool,I used to pay for them with Bitcoin, for 2 years, next year will be   BCH, nice 
Paid a two year plan with it !
Thanks for the post!
Finally! I couldn't renew my subscription because the bitcoin fees were too high.

I'll never understand folks who complain about a merchant adopting crypto... sure it's not *your* crypto, but any adoption is a win for all.
I used to pay for them with Bitcoin. Paid for them last time with Fiat. Going forward will be using BCH!
That's quite a flip-flop if true: https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/blog/2017/06/bitcoin-uasf-private-internet-access-stands-people/

[If only there were some way to verify it while you were looking at their website.](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/buy-vpn/)"
Substratum.
What about NordVPN?
Awesome Awston! Thanks!
Already has.
"> it's not your crypto

Which only means it's losing competition race. Do something or switch. Complaining is pointless"
True, and shapeshift etc is easy.
Not a BCH holder, and I fully agree with this.
Yea they accept like zcash I think to maybe others.

Is it a good VPN?
TOO LATE MOTHERFUCKERS, I already switched from PIA to airVPN because airVPN immediately accepted bitcoin cash. now suffer the consequences you fuckers at PIA, you lost customers forever, airVPN is actually better anyway, like WAY BETTER. airVPN allows very easily port forwarding and your VPN connection stays up for weeks while PIA connections break once in every couple of days.
"PIA is the biggest honey-pot VPN in existence. Look up the history of ""LavaBit"" (spelling?) and think long and hard.... if something that small caused such a harsh response, what do you think the reaction would be for these folks... seeing as this is infinitely a more significant deal. They NEVER come under US scrutiny. I can think of about 20 VPN providers that weren't located in the US, yet were effectively ""shut down"" by the US. Yet these guys operate out in the open in US jurisdiction, and nobody does shit? Get fucking real guys.

95% of all VPN services you find on the web are likely to be honey pots. They might help with keeping your porn viewing and downloads secret from your ISP, but meh. If you find your VPN on any sort of ""review/compare"" (LOL) website, then think twice before subscribing. 

""keeping logs"" mean nothing when the company controls the keys - and they can't prove anything."

"Yeah man, same.

You aren't wrong.
