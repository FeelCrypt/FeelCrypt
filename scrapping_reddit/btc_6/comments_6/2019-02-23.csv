Yeah tradings a literal profession people spend their whole lives to get consistent profits at. No guy off thevstreet is gonna be able to properly trade without pure luck. 
I agree but vote cheating is hard to prove after the fact. It helps when mods see it happening in real-time and we can watch it. If this happens in the future and you are seeing it happen from the start, send mod mail. Thanks.

This is a crappy low effort meme-y post, and it has almost definitely been vote manipulated to the top of r/btc. This stuff never gets anywhere near this number of upvotes, even clever bashing of the lightning network.
I'm the one who finds blocks!
"""trader"" is a nice word for ""gambler"". CMV"
one year feels like half a century.

It only took three months for me to get there but my diet slowly just became pots of coffee and bottles of wine.
will it not be other way round now.
The number of people who think they're counting cards when they're just playing the slots is disenhartening tho'.
