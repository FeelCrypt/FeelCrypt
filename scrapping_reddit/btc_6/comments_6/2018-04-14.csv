Don't mind the bot, he is a useful tool. Ill upvote you a bunch here. 
hey thanks but i believe in this bot and other efforts after seeing just what is at stake for people motivated to shill/spam in a low traffic subs just for karma, let alone bitcoin subs over the future political status of their pet projects /trillions of usd.
">Geez, you are stupid.

Fuck you too. "
Redditor /u/kingp43x has low karma in this subreddit.
"Somebody once said ""The only 'intuitive' interface is the nipple. After that it's all learned."""
When [Bitcoin.com's wallet](https://wallet.bitcoin.com/) recently updated to ONLY create a BCH wallet by default, they took a MAJOR step closer to simplicity!
"Exactly. It is after all called BITCOIN dot COM wallet.

If someone wants to make (another) wallet for Bcore they should do so and perhaps use BCORE dot COM, and then add all that complication regarding fees, fee estimating, RBF and all that shite.... not even to mention Lightning Network add-ons and so much wank you'd need tissues just to navigate the interface."
Yes we need to move now. There is a 14-year-old developer that creates voting mechanism for bitcoin Cash but itâ€™s not like a decentralized Twitter. We need this bad.
