"To me Libra coin looks like another TON with loads of hype generated mostly due to the established company behind it. The difference is that Facebook is way further from the initial concept of crypto and decentralization than TON. It's bound to be a buy just because of the vicious circle 'big money flows to big money and heats up the price', not for the idea of it.

To add up:

1. Does anyone believe Libra Association gonna be truly independent with a Facebook employee in charge?
2. Anyone saw the info which assets will be in the basket Libra will be pegged to? I only saw they were called 'less prone to inflation'. What are these but for USD they're bound to use though it's a bubble on its own?"
"STRONG DELUSION is why. God said in the bible that he would bring it upon the whole entire world. And thus, they are NOT ABLE to see this.

Sad, right?  :-\"
What are the faithful supposed to do during the time when the whole world is under this mark of the beast system?
