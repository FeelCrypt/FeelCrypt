"Peter Todd: ""bitcoin unlimited is fundamentally broken""

Yet he can't explain how, of course. What a dumbass."
I prefer BSCore who will soon be on the BSC minority chain. 
"So who is BlockstreamCore?
"
"you're right, it won't be easy to recruit that additional 40%.  my pt was that if and when we do, the release of a 1.1MB blocks is ""easy"" in the sense that it could be done at any pt by a miner and i think there won't be a minority chain that lasts for long.  but that's an assumption of mine."
If the majority of the miners want to attack/destroy Bitcoin, they can do it with core as well. You are not a Bitcoiner. You don't believe into the honesty of the majority of the miners. The majority is not as evil as the core supporting Shitclub Network and alikes.
"> implementing the whole EB mechanism

Part of my question is, is the mechanism non-trivial to implement, or can it be done with a few tweaks e.g. the sort of patch a distro may apply to a stock package? In the former case sure, you can argue BU is fundamentally broken. In the latter case, I'm not sure that's fair."
"It can only succeed if >50% of the hashrate follow along long to mid-term. And that is exactly what I am saying.
More than 50% of honest miners wanting the network to function is enough for Bitcoin to operate well."
Well, the dissenters are excommunicated. Have you seen the way /r/Bitcoin talks about Gavin? 
"1) that is pretty much the premise of open source. 
2) not really, it's not because core dev dont want to participate that there is no peer review
3) so what? The block has been orphaned as planned, get over it. It affected nobody but the miner and he is okay with it.

4) I have no idea what you are talking about. A quick Google search bring up nothing. Of course, your kind can never ever fucking back up their claims. 

There is two issue on the github regarding pruning. One is ""pruning not working when inside a docker container?"" and the other is ""pruning leaves too many blocks on disk"". Both of these issue are trivial and definitely not a reason to hold a release. 

Id even argue that *any* issue with pruning is trivial."
"The narrative seems to be now shifting to literally rigging the vote since SegWit lost the *fair vote* for all intents and purposes. The hypocrisy is palpable parroting any Core chain as the ""real Bitcoin"" while doing everything that can be done to undermine the very Nakamoto consensus and incentive mechanisms that enable Bitcoin to work the way it does. 

"
But you're fine with BU at 60%?
[deleted]
Sure. I don't hang around the IRC channel either, but is anyone from Core openly advocating for the 2MB+Segwit compromise over there? Color me surprised, if so. Wouldn't even matter anyway, as the top of their obvious hierarchy is prepared to go down with the ship rather than admit they don't always know what's best.
"> If the majority of the miners want to attack/destroy Bitcoin, they can do it with core as well

Yes they can.  Via a softfork...."
Is this English? 
"Uh, Gavin has never been negligent towards Bitcoin. You're taking crazy pills or haven't been here very long if you believe that.

> it's been ready for more than a year

Segwit hasn't been ready for a year. 

> that is from BEFORE BU started spamming the network

It's called user growth, and it's precisely why Bitcoin has value.
https://blockchain.info/charts/n-transactions-per-block?scale=1&timespan=all

Core has been negligent because they've prevented on-chain user growth.

Enjoy getting downvoted."

"He's not an official employee, but pretty sure he does contract work with them occasionally.

And frankly, the company is so sketchy that it wouldn't surprise me if they've compromised other Core developers, besides Peter, under the table. You'd think there would be, like... at least one dissenting voice in Core, against what they're doing, but no, everyone marches in lockstep for some reason."
that's why they didn't interview any of the other BS/Core developers. 
This is why I prefer to call them BlockstreamCore.
But we're practically at parity with Core signalling right now? Where is the other 40% of hash power signalling for BU going to come from?
"> Can miners use Core to do (or expose themselves to) an EB attack by recompiling?

Err...  Why is recompiling Core and implementing the whole EB mechanism any different to BU?

Or is this part of the general because it CAN be done it SHOULD be done logic of BU?

The same logic can apply to jumping off a cliff.  Just because you CAN jump off a cliff, does that mean you SHOULD?"
Nice try.  If the ledger is the same, what is the difference?
"> Good, then you admit BU is not broken, only that some miners could use it wrongly. Progress.

No.  I am saying so far as BU's EB mechanism is used at all, its broken.

"
"> I think the median EB attack is a legitimate concern. However, it's fairly easy for the miners to avoid it with sensible signalling and settings

These settings need to be implemented.  Sure if its fixed, then its not broken..."
"Facts in my post:-

1.) BU developerss copied the core code
2.) They released their code without peer review
3.) It malfunctioned 
4.) They continue to make mistakes and have a pruning issue in their latest release that was even pointed out to them before they released their client.

Facts in your post:-
None.


To everyone reading this, this is the perfect example of how BU has any support. People like this resort to nothing more than argument tactics as though the ""winner"" of this ""debate"" is to be decided through anything other than facts. BU is gaining support (albeit very little, their hash rate increase is just themselves) through POLITICS for a TECHNICAL issue, that frankly they are not qualified to resolve. Their motivation is personal gain, pure and simple, don't unwittingly support their personal agendas. "
Gavin was fired for being consistently negligent. Core made a solution for all the future of up-scaling that even improves privacy of Bitcoin, it's been ready for more than a year.....that is from BEFORE BU started spamming the network. So how have they neglected anything?
"> I don't personally think the node count argument has any real merit. 

Of course it doesn't, it's Core's final desperate refuge now that 1MB4LIFE+SEGWIT has been firmly rejected.

Core's motto has essentially become: ""You will do things our way or you'll regret it""."
Indeed I've noticed. Speaking the truth to a Core dev is a very revolutionary act.
this is probably true
"> ""More than 50% of HP can undo transactions. Therefore Bitcoin is broken.""

The median EB attack can be launched by one miner finding one block once.  That is a lot easier than having 50% of the global hashrate"
Yeah, so the goal of BU is to kill Bitcoin.
"I am not sure why your comment is related to the ""median EB attack"".

Having miners follow is the objective of the attack"
"I don't care about your attempt to censor with downvotes! Gavin HAS been negligent, that's why he was FIRED. Anyone interested, look it up, don't believe what these BU liars say.

Segwit has been ready for many months, is it not a year yet? Sure feels like it.

Core developed something that can bring Bitcoin on par with VISA WHILE providing improved privacy. BU will never compete with visa, even with 10gb blocks....that isn't a solution, it's a joke!"
You genuinely think people get paid to write on reddit? Wow.
">On the other side: if a small group of individuals can change consensus rules with hash power then it is not Bitcoin anymore.

It is! It literally is the way Bitcoin is meant to work are you joking?

Well we all like more decentralisation but that exactly why Bitcoin is trustless. Because of the competition for block reward!

If a small group can change Bitcoin consensus rules using their influence alone then the door is open for government to do the same things?

Then cryptocurrency is dead.

>I guess you'll argue that whatever the hash follows is bitcoin. I'm sick of arguing against that, so I'll just say if that's true Bitcoin is not interesting to me.

Sorry that the rules, if you disagree you better sell an return to FIAT, "
Neither is your median EB atttack, which is the equivalent of a tic tac toe game when the reality is 3D chess.
Have you thought that maybe BU is winning because of the disdain for core? They are unwilling to compromise making a hard fork basically inevitable. It's a shame really, now they might end up with a client with the lesser amount of nodes. If you can't unite the community large portion of the community, a split is inevitable. It's not based on technical merits at all, it's a development team that ignored a large portion of the community and that portion of the community was essentially driven to create another client leading to a split. If you wanted to know why it's happening, it's really that simple
"Buddy, no matter what I say it will confirm what you say because you are a ""it confirms what I say troll"". You distort what other say to fit your discourse but I guess I dont have to teach you your game.

"Roger and Jihan are two of the staunchest bitcoin advocates in the space. Both estimated to hold more than 100k coins each and have been involved since 2010 or 2011. Why would they want to harm bitcoin and destroy their wealth? What would they stand to gain from having control over the network?

Is it a big deal where the devs are paid from? You say that like it's a bad thing but if you want to play that game I can talk about how bitcoin Core devs are all privately paid by banks."
">as when you say ""this is the bullshit BU supporters believe.""as when you say ""this is the bullshit BU supporters believe.""

Also please note i never used any bad language, i never said 'bullshit' once. Is another one of the shill's methods misquoting people? 

""Handful of millionaires"" - My points are very clear and convincing, no one reading this with an open mind will take BU seriously afterwards. Anyone that cares enough will do their own research regarding this point, look up Jihan Wu and Roger Ver, the biggest proponents. Bare in mind it gives miners total control, Jihan owns the biggest mining hardware companys...what a coincidence. Oh and their developers are paid privately and the source of funding is hidden/anonymous donations, seems legit, right?"
They most certainly do: https://99bitcoins.com/coin-fire-professional-bitcoin-trolls-exist/
There is no competition to be 'won'. BU is not taken seriously by the majority of the bitcoin economy, it can only be manipulated into effect.

">&gt; It is! It literally is the way Bitcoin is meant to work are you joking?

>Not joking at all, I think you have a profound misunderstanding of bitcoin. 

It literally written in the the white paper and **in the code:**

The valid chain is the longest chain (the one with the most POW invested in it).

Bitcoin 101

>&gt; If a small group can change Bitcoin consensus rules using their influence alone then the door is open for government to do the same things?

>What you say is nonsensical, it is easier for a government to buy hashing power than influence. 

Believe it or not making law and putting people in jail buy you quite a lot of influence, ask paypal or your regular under how much under governments influence they are! 

Seriously you guys are living on another planet..

But say you are right it is cheaper to buy POW than influence.. 

**it doesn't matter because POW is not enough to break consensus rules node will always refuse an invalid chain..**

That is.. before SEGWIT.. and UASF make it even worst now big Bitcoin businesses can decide what chain is valid and what consensus rules they want to break, hey! What can go wrong?"
Whatever you say.
"> it doesn't matter because POW is not enough to break consensus rules node will always refuse an invalid chain..

Well thanks for making my point in bold. Miners follow the nodes."
"Yes and nodes follow the heaviest chain.

What happen if nodes are cheated into breaking rules? (SFSW, UASF)

Then breaking Bitcoin consensus rules get trivial."
"> It is! It literally is the way Bitcoin is meant to work are you joking?

Not joking at all, I think you have a profound misunderstanding of bitcoin.

What you say is nonsensical, it is easier for a government to buy hashing power than influence. "
"1.) So, you agree.  2.) So, you acknowledge this is true, but make an excuse. 3.) So, you agree again but play it down. 4.) Again, you agree.They made a mistake by failing to integrate a noted improvement before a release. 

...here is another perfect example of my post above folks, plain as day, BU gains support through politics only. Their support use argument based tactics to brush aside and play down the facts to gain further support from the misinformed. Don't unwittingly support personal agendas, there is already the perfect solution, fully tested that provides the basis for up-scaling forever and even improves privacy and it's ready to go and has been for a very long time.

"Kindly note, you've supplied an article from sixth months ago that presents a hypothetical issue....that has already been addressed, because there is an alpha release of the lightning network available for further TESTING out for the last two months (see the importance real developers put on testing now?), that will ensure nothing can go wrong with it.

But again, more insults from you, as if im lazy to research. Ironic that your lack of research has meant you spent a good amount of time creating an invalid argument.  

I must have said it ten times now, so to anyone reading it must be becoming abundantly clear, the BU supporter's position is nothing more than inaccuracies and argument based tactics. 

When we come down to the facts the BU supporter is completely useless, prepared to follow a path based only on blind faith, a faith not on the merits of what they support. No. A faith based on blind ignorance, because, after all lightning will never get released...:-

"Well the higher the better, 

If there is a threat of UASF I actually support a currency split.. so any threshold would be good.. if a small group of individuals can change consensus rules without hash power then it is not Bitcoin anymore."
Your level of absolute stupidity and lack of any sort of coherent thought whatsoever is a real marvel to behold.
">  I'm sure you know that already and getting paid.

I must be getting paid because I'm poking fun at your retardedness on reddit?"
The rule by intimidation is nasty. Not only does it silence dissent from the other non Blockstream core devs, it encourages them to compromise any principles they may have had for open source development or sound money. We see it everyday on Wall Street where everyone actually knows about the moral hazard of money printing but they go along with it because they just say fuck it, let me get my share. We see it in the companies and altcoins that numerous core devs have established like Bitgo and Green Address that are built to leverage the 75%discount to SW tx's over regular tx's meant to drive users to centralized LN hubs that will siphon tx fees away from miners. 
They can do it with a HF as well. Recompile one line of code.
"> I think its quite difficult to implement

It's been implemented in Classic and btcd.  /u/thomaszander estimated it to be about one day of work to add it to Core."
"> Now please die fucking troll.

This is very sad, can't you see how you completely prove the entire basis of my point when you retort with this? I've said each time BU supporters can only engage with argument based tactics. You've offered nothing to this discussion......only argued with me, then resorted to insulting and swearing, which is what I said BU supporters do. This is because they have no substance to their stance, it is born from manipulation and they don't realize the facts, they are just helping a small group of millionaires achieve their personal agenda within Bitcoin.

We already covered this, I'll do it again for you:-

1.) I know, we are agreed BU criticize Core but then steal their work to base changes from. They change core principles that give miners more power, yet don't start from previous versions and even directly reference core in their code.

2.) In your first response you said.... ""because core dev dont want to participate that there is no peer review""....you acknowledgd there isn't any real peer review already, did you forget? Even worse of BU when someone points out a mistake in their code they don't even bother to fix it.

3.) On what planet is it not important to be thorough with code that billions of dollars will rely on? I know....BU shill planet.

4.) Considering this point references the mistake you ALREADY acknowledged in point 3, it is a little difficult to then pretend it never happened, considering its written for all to see.

Feel free to insult me some more I will not mind, I'm sure I am annoying to you but please know this is nothing personal against you, its personal against BU who manipulated and misled people like you into supporting them. "
"Have you seen what the BU miners signal?

Exactly. That attack is a non-issue. Because incentives."
"The entire community is against the propaganda you're spreading. It's not censorship, it's organic disagreement with your misinformation.

Segwit can't bring Bitcoin to Visa levels because it doesn't allow for an adaptive blocksize. But you wouldn't know that because you're not a developer. Don't take it from me, take it from your precious Peter Todd: https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/here-s-how-bitcoin-s-lightning-network-could-fail-1467736127/

Core has made 54% of addresses with Bitcoin amounts unspendable due to high fees.

These users will not be able to open or close LN channels to reach those so called visa levels you're talking about. But you're good at ignoring facts so don't worry about it.

Since you don't do much independent research, I'll just paste the relevant parts here:

>“We do have a failure mode which is: Imagine a whole bunch of these [settlements] have to happen at once,” Todd explained. “There’s only so much data that can go through the bitcoin network and if we had a large number of Lightning channels get closed out very rapidly, how are we going to get them all confirmed? At some point, you run out of capacity.”

>In a scenario where a large number of people need to settle their Lightning contracts on the blockchain, the price for doing so could increase substantially as the available space in bitcoin blocks becomes sparse. “At some point some people start losing out because the cost is just higher than what they can afford,” Todd said. “If you have a very large percentage of the network using Lightning, potentially this cost is very high. **Potentially, we could get this mass outbreak of failure**.”

>The way the Lightning Network works, a user must be able to issue a breach remedy transaction in order to keep their counterparty honest. If a user is unable to make the proper transaction on the blockchain in a certain amount of time, their counterparty may be able to take control of bitcoins tied up in the smart contract between the two parties.

...

> Any situation that allows for coins to be stolen obviously needs to be avoided and according to Todd, there are some theoretical solutions available for this problem. For one, **an adaptive block size limit could allow miners to increase capacity in these sorts of failure scenarios**.

Still trust core's scaling roadmap? They don't give a shit about you.

An adaptive blocksize is exactly what BU adds.

Go ahead, put your tail between your legs and run away troll."
"A very common tactic of paid online shills is to say ""it's true! Look it up!"" without ever providing a source. 
Another technique is repeatedly addressing an invisible audience instead of the person you are replying to, as when you say ""this is the bullshit BU supporters believe.""

Yet another technique is using loaded weasel words and sharp language to put a negative image in the reader's mind, as when you say ""a handful of millionaires pushing an agenda."" Please explain how this is the case if so.

You're a troll, shill, and propagandist. I hope everyone else can see through your transparent schtick."
"If SWUAF goes live with low hashrate, a miner could just take all the anyone can spend outputs from segwit transactions and let core fork themselves out of the network. No debate which chain is ""Bitcoin"" in this scenario, as all non-segwit clients will stay on the original chain. It would be a terrible idea for BU to initiate another split before the segwit hard fork chain is dead and >1mb blocks have overwhelming consensus, i would say >75 or 80% minimum with a few months activation time to be safe, and give core a chanse to release a client which follow the new consensus rules."
"On the other side: if a small group of individuals can change consensus rules with hash power then it is not Bitcoin anymore.

I guess you'll argue that whatever the hash follows is bitcoin. I'm sick of arguing against that, so I'll just say if that's true Bitcoin is not interesting to me.
"
"> They can do it with a HF as well. Recompile one line of code.

That would not necessarily be a successful attack on the original chain"
"> /u/thomaszander estimated it to be about one day of work to add it to Core.

But BU **IS** it implemented in Core..."
"1) yup. That is what is open source.
2) I dont agree at all. Peer review is actively going on and even an asshole like you can participate. 
3) Yes it is not important.
4) no dont agree at all.

Now please die fucking troll."
60% on BU should hopefully be enough to force a compromise from core to develop a safer HF with a high activation threshold. Just splitting that early would be devastating, and it's not going to happen because most of those 60% wouldn't go ahead with it. Let's say just 1/8 of BU miners don't really want to split, then you would need 80% on BU to split with 70% of hashrate.
"Well we don't have to trust them to be ""honest"" as Satoshi unfortunately worded it. Replace the term honest with ""intelligently profit-seeking."" **Bitcoin assumes miners are intelligently profit-seeking**, meaning that they have a decent enough read on what the ecosystem wants that they can and will make any necessary changes to please the ecosystem and thus boost their own bottom line. 

Greg's [recent comments on BU](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/5yojyp/on_the_recent_bout_of_malleated_transactions/) totally discredited him, as he revealed himself to have no friggin' idea how Bitcoin works. He actually thought ""honest"" meant something like ""plays by Core rules."" That's a completely broken understanding of Bitcoin, and implies centralization. It's the kind of misconception I'd expect from a run-of-the-mill nobody on a forum, not from the mighty leader of Core/BS. I'm kinda pissed I wasted mental clock ticks trying to debate this guy without realizing he has not just a flawed understanding, but zero understanding of how Bitcoin works at all. And of course all his supporters parrot his nonsense view of how Bitcoin supposedly works."
Viacoin? How's that doing these days? I can't see it on coinmarketcap.
"> We need to get to 60 or 70 percent of miners on board to activate Bitcoin Unlimited,” Ver said in an interview at his office in Tokyo on Mar. 9.

"Peter and others just want those AXA checks to keep rolling in as long as possible, before the investors realize they've been conned and pull the plug on Greg's entire shady operation.

None of these clowns has ever explained how larger or dynamic blocks would make the user experience worse. They just shout ""CENTRALIZATION"" and ""CHINACOIN"" and ""ROGER VER"" again and again. Fewer and fewer people care anymore.

Peter is well-placed to offer a 2MB+Segwit compromise, or even just a regular 2MB hard fork as a show of good faith to miners before they accept Segwit. He's not going to do either, because he's disingenuous and it would show hard forks aren't dangerous at all, nor is a 2MB block size for that matter."
"Toddler neglects to mention that Bitcoin Core's development team is also fundamentally broken.

Worse than BU purportedly is, as the market has been slowly ditching Core for months."
"Then Bitcoin is fundamentally broken, because BU doesn't give anyone any tools they didn't have pretty easy access to before. If he understood what BU is he would at most be arguing, ""Certain possible configurations that BU allows for are fundamentally broken."" To point the argument at BU already shows that the person hasn't grasped the situation. If anything, he should be addressing miners and nodes, saying, ""Don't run these settings."""
Why do these articles always have some fake ass picture of a physical bitcoin?
Peter has talked about his opinions many times. His problem with the larger block size and the hard fork can be found [here](https://petertodd.org/2016/hardforks-after-the-segwit-blocksize-increase)
I'm not convinced a UASF is a good idea either
"BU is a joke, so are its supporters. 

Who supports a set of developers that copy the code of something they are trying to replace, edit it badly, release their code without peer review, watch it malfunction and then CONTINUE to support them and their crap code? They are STILL MAKING MISTAKES, even their latest release has a pruning error. Someone already pointed it out and no one changed it before the release. Or didn't you know about that? I'd guess not, seeing as most of you are brainwashed simpletons in this sub."
"I guess so, though it is rather ambiguous about ""consensus,"" making it seem as though BU is not a consensus solution. For it to activate, of course, consensus will be required. The real debate isn't about whether it would eventually be a consensus solution prior to activation but about what threshold constitutes consensus and which people count for consensus purposes. (At this point, no solution would achieve consensus with the high bar that seems implicit in the article.)"
should be 30% of miners tho, not 3%, kinda important.
Bloomberg LP isn't exactly mainstream media when it comes to bitcoin.  They were one of the investors who backed Coinbase's largest funding round.  Their reporting ever since has been more favorable and accurate than most news sites.
"The really important thing is to talk to exchanges and other business who may be running Core nodes as a ""default"". The node situation is Core's last real argument against BU. They've convinced themselves that an economic majority supports Segwit because a bunch of companies said, ""Sure, if it activates we're ready"" and because 75% of Core nodes run a post-Segwit version.

But even if the Core/BU node ratio dropped to 60/40, they wouldn't really have the node argument anymore.

I also don't care for this narrative they're pushing that Jihan and Roger control/brainwash all mining pools. If they did, Core would have been dropped last year. Core doesn't like the fact that other mining pool operators can think for themselves and decide that Core not the way forward."

Pretty accurate reporting there. Well done MSM.
Good job Ver! The media and the exchanges are accepting the fact that bitcoin unlimited is de facto bitcoin (BTC). The minority hashrate UASF coin is an altcoin which nobody will want to invest in (or banks perhaps will?)
Hopefully Jihan and Ver can get other major pools on board, and to get miners to switch pools that do support BU.

By all definitions, UASF coin / minority hashrate coin is an altcoin.

Perhaps. But we're talking about BU here, not hypothetical UASF ideas.

*bitdoggy 
Bitcoin unlimited is currently just another bitcoin implementation (the other one is bitcoin limited or bitcoin core) that does not deviate from Satoshi's whitepaper. How can that be a new altcoin in formation? The ""original chain"" does not get the right to the previously used name (ETH/ETC scenario).

I see what you're trying to say here - you are ready to go past SW activation date like nothing happened or you have hidden hashpower up your sleeve.

That is the idea behind you guys arguments. You simply cannot stand the idea of incentives and uncertainty.

Yet Bitcoin needs all of that to survive. It is *based* upon those ideas to find a practical-though-not-perfect solution to the BGP."
"I think the median EB attack is a legitimate concern. However, it's fairly easy for the miners to avoid it with sensible signalling and settings. Thus, I don't think that ""attack"" rises to the level of ""fundamentally broken""."
The joke is when people like yourself who very obviously do not understand things very well try and talk like they know everything
A river made of horses hair? I don't get it.
"> The median EB attack alone is sufficient to call BU fundamentally broken.

LOL. If anything is broken, it's your BS attack against BU. 
If you don't trust the majority of hashing power, then Bitcoin is nothing for you.
One hash - one vote. "
"I can pretty much guarantee you that most major businesses have already tested (or are in the process of testing) BU, and could start additional BU nodes if it were close to activating (most major businesses are likely running multiple nodes to protect against sybil attacks). 

I don't personally think the node count argument has any real merit. "
"Exactly. It's the community that has been speaking for years now and they are only following. BSCore's continual attacks should be considered an attack on the community itself as is evidenced by the censorship and ostracism of many former prominent early adopters from the bait and switched forums like N Corea and BCT. . 

But it's not working because all those people are continuing to work on other ways to further the cause of Satoshi's original vision. Sorry BSCore. "
That's just silly. Miners want control of the future of tx's. This fight has always been between Blockstream who want to control tx's off-line and miners on-chain. We are just pawns in this battle. 
"The unwritten rule is, ""Don't hassle the Core devs."" "
:-) thanks for the spelling tip.
I don't predict a lot of dumping. It won't take much for the price to drop below the point where it's cheaper to shut off the mining rigs vs pay for the electricity. Once it hits that point it's done. Perhaps a few blocks, but there will be such a backlog of transactions there won't be many successful trades.
Traitor. 
The sudden 200 or so appearance of SWSF nodes over the last 2wk since UASF appeared is highly suspicious for a corporate Sybil attack. 
His main argument - ethereum seems to be dead at this point with Ethereum at the $28 level
The entire network has reached a malfunctioning point under 1mb core with unconfirmed transactions. Core has been negligent to basic network operations. Nobody trusts core anymore. I've been here since late 2012 and the best core developers were purged after Blockstream started paying the other devs. Gavin Andresen, the best developer Bitcoin has ever had, supports BU.
Fundamentally bought.
"This.

I had a (painful) discussion with some core fanbois the other day. They think they're going to have double their bitcoins (as has been the general misunderstanding in the KoreEchoChamber).

Prediction - there will be a mass exodus of Corefanbois & unfortunate people who've brought into Corebullshit, selling their coins on the HashCashCore chain, then going ""oh fuck, why don't i have double my bitcoins??"" - this will get rid of a massive amount of idiots (and the unlucky ones who just didn't know better) and it will quite happily show how BlockstreamCore don't know wtf they are talking about."
lately i wake up smiling every morning about this :)

"Luckily Ver isn't a developer, nor is he the boss of any mining pools besides his own small one.

The miners would not fork at 60%, regardless of what Roger says.

Core takes the miners for idiots. Core takes Roger as some sort of boogeyman. Both stances are absurd."
"Well UASF is basically an hard fork with 20% hash rate support..

Hello
"It is safer to do an HF with a large enough majority, so just after the HF there is little / no risk of a reorganization of the chain and confusion.

This also allows the confirmation time between blocks to be

not an argument
If BU gains 75% support or more it would very good going forward for Bitcoin.  Even if there ends up being two Bitcoins BU would be like ETH and Core would be like ETC.  Maybe the price would fall temporary but the market would look ahead to scaling and where the larger user base wanted to be.  Which wallet would the major exchanges run do you think?
You do realize that Peter Todd is not working for Blockstream, right?
"60% is far more than enough.  Any decrease in hash rate now that blocks are full will cause a 1MB coin to slow down block generation.  This will cause it to accept less transactions.  This will cause fees to go up.  This will mean more and more addresses are frozen and unable to be spent.  

With less transactions and less addresses able to even be spent at all  and a parallel chain still going that has plenty of capacity and the same ledger, what will people use?  They want to transact after all.  People will stop using the 1MB chain because they can't.   Larger addresses will be able to pay high transaction fees and buy fiat or buy into the other chain.  There will be no reason to make anything except for larger and larger transactions since any address that dips under the fee minimum will be unspendable.  The larger addresses will gradually be broken up into smaller units and more value will be frozen.

While this happens the price will drop since the way to actually transact will be on the large block chain. This will cause a feedback loop of less mining power, longer block times, less transaction volume, higher fees (at least in the btc value), and more unspendable addresses.  Less transaction capacity will mean less utility, which will mean lower price etc, until the whole chain collapses and grinds to a halt."
"The HF to BU is happening as we speak. It's a relatively slow EASY process that works fundamentally different from core's ""signaling"" mechanism. "
I even saw one user argue for bitcoin holders should decide what the network does. Like, what?
The Bilderberg connection was proven already. 
Perhaps not, but I've heard emojis do 😎
Well the holders do decide a lot. But not exactly *decide* but incentivize miners to decide. That's the subtlety that trips up the Core side. They rebel against the idea that the miners control Bitcoin because they realize it is not quite true. But then they go the other direction and fail to realize that it is true in a certain sense. Miners have control but are incentivized not to use it for ill. Edit: That's the basic premise of Bitcoin, and they reject it, not seeing that they are actually themselves Bitcoin skeptics.
"Exactly, they're talking it up like BU wants to fork ASAP. In reality, we're seeking consensus. I'm sure there's a ""fork it"" faction, but it's not the prevailing sentiment here as far as I can tell."

BU needs better/more/more effective marketing efforts - this is an exact example.  one more person that would otherwise support BU but had incorrect information.  what can the community or individuals do to help with this?
"Repeating something such as these lies a thousand times is a technique which politicians employ - some mud sticks. These things work on credulous minds - of which we can see there are many among the core supporters.

Our best course of action is maintain confidence and self belief and to carry on advocating our position and doing what we can to give BU traction. As time goes on the desperation tactics will get increasingly overt and more and more people will see certain participants for what they truly are.

While the crack in the dam appears to only let a trickle flow out such that one may feel the water will never drain, we can be sure that the structure is weakened and will inevitably give way entirely - perhaps sooner than we might expect."
Also, it's not like after 75% happens we'll all rocket into the abyss with infinitely large blocks anyway. For a *long, loooooooong* time chances are nothing will change until consensus EB size increases. That itself will take a while, as the pools sort it out over open communication or BIP100-style signaling - nobody significant will move first for fear of losing revenue, and non-consensus trolls will be discarded as they should.

    Greg,
    
    ... as it's been explained to me (please correct if there are errors here), this is the case against in broad outlines:
    
    * you work for a venture capital funded startup called blockstream
    
    * blockstream is funded in part from money, now with controlling interest, from the Bilderberg ""club""
    
    * blockstream employs a large fraction, probably a majority of the now ""core"" bitcoin developers
    
    * the primary business of blockstream is to build an off-chain payment network called lightning network (LN), which is a for-profit service that will generate private revenue to this company, and thus pay back the VC investors. at 55M post on last round, it's a 0.5->few billion to pay back this debt.
    
    * the only effective way LN systems work is to implement segwit
    
    * increasing block size now to 2, 4 or 8mb (or at all) reduces the need for a separate payment network like LN
    
    * increasing to 2,4 or 8 mb is possible right now (many tests and data show this, I've seen them), but core has not implemented larger blocks primarily because doing so conflicts with blockstream business priorities - it would lessen any need for off-chain, for-profit transaction processing
    
    * moreover, segwit is inordinately complex, trying to solve for a problem we do not have, and will require all future implementations of bitcoin clients to carry with it the overhead of segwit implementations - which only makes sense if you buy into making off chain systems to process transactions

    please, address these concerns directly, or refute with alternate facts.  these parallel threads allow for open discussion and look forward to it!

If you left bitcoin then you missed out it rising 5x in 18 months.
"[They already are](https://coin.dance/blocks/historical)

And no, we're not going to fork until we know we're going to win. There's no clock, every day Core digs itself a deeper hole and bans a few more Bitcoiners from their sub so why would we stop them doing our job for us?

Your insistence we be hasty is motivated by your understandable anxiety that if done in due course the hard fork will work - which it will.

You can come to terms with this now or later. It's harder on your ego in the short term to admit you were wrong and change your opinion now, but there's always the option to stay in denial until reality makes the choice for you. Your call."
"Absolutely. I was referring to this particular statement parent mentioned, i.e., the two ""sides"" Gavin referenced in the tweet. Both of *those* sides on this one point are Core fabrications."
"Thank you for helping show that the ""fork it"" crowd is made up of a lot of small-blockers. Why would we fork ourselves into obscurity? ""Our"" coin WILL be bitcoin."
I don't think you understand how BU works. 
"https://coin.dance/blocks/historical

Definitely looks like things are never going to change.  Never.  Like, never ever.

lol keep telling yourself that."
"Looks like it should be ""blockstream"" instead of ""blockchain"" , where did you get this from?"
"Is this serious? 

You got the name of the company wrong, so you didn't even bother doing basic research (https://blockstream.com/about/) and the Bilderberg ""club"" controls it! lol 

You should've just asked him to deny he is a lizard person?"
"With BU, your node has whatever cap you set it to. Which might make you end up on a minority chain, but it was and is always like that. For example, if you set it to Luke-Jr's proposed 300kB now, you follow him on his small block user-activated soft-fork minority chain. (I don't know whether it exists)

So what alternative to being able to set your EB/AD/MG with BU do you want?

*Someone telling you what to do?*

There are no such authorities that can do that for you, *unless you make them your* **personal** *authorities*.

 But you are always strongly incentivized to follow the majority of the miners - and it has always been that way."
Controlled? Evidence?
