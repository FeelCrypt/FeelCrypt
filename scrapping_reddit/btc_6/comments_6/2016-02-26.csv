"> On-chain scaling puts every transaction on the block chain

That's a false dichotomy. On-chain scaling puts _more_ transactions on the blockchain, but we could use both on-chain and off-chain scaling together."
"Thanks for this comment. I think EVERYONE in the community feels anger towards someone or something within Bitcoin. This is why boardroom meetings aren't live-telecast. Bitcoin is open source, and all its dirty laundry is there for viewing. Andreas spoke to this in speaking about Bitcoin's anti-fragility:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw8W92iIHZ8

But we have a choice about whether or not to vent that anger on these forums. There's a chance for these forums to be productive and rewarding spaces. But that depends on us not standing in our own way because of anger. Basically: We can't let whatever anger exists (no matter how ""legitimate"") overtake the opportunity for meaningful dialogue. "
"Are you arguing coins with better fungibility mechanisms like Dash and Monero also sacrifice confidentiality with on chain transaction scaling? Because I think your pants are on fire.

This is typical of core devs in this argument though - take a current technical limitation and instead of addressing it as its own problem, use it as the basis for an argument to support the status quo. "
"""Debunked"" _in the specific case of large multipliers_. In the large-multiplier case, I agree that median is better. For small multipliers (1.5-3) I'd still prefer average (not that it matters much, but I really like the philosophical ""purity"" of having the ""state"" of the adjustment algorithms being extremely small, which an EMA can do, whereas with a median the state ends up including the previous 2016 blocks [and I'd argue difficulty adjustment should also be EMA; the ethereum blockchain's [extremely steady block time](https://etherchain.org/statistics/basic) imo proves the case])."
I still don't get the point you're trying to make in relation to my initial comment on the fact that most businesses want on-chain scaling.

"> When you really sit down and work through possible options with businesses, as I have done, they typically don't want on-chain scaling.

Yeah? Which ones? You obviously didn't sit down with Coinbase, Xapo, Circle just to name the biggest ones who all support on chain scaling. 

How scaling on chain transactions is preventing businesses to use Bitcoin for off chain usages? You're not making any sense."
"Find the time! The future of Bitcoin could be in your hands!

"When you really sit down and work through possible options with businesses, as I have done, they typically *don't* want on-chain scaling.

Think about it: if you are a business, why would you *want* a solution that involves your competitors being able to figure out how much you are paying your suppliers, or how much your customers are spending on your product? On-chain bitcoin transactions, even when used well, do a piss-poor job of hiding this information. I know it may run counter to the mob wisdom of this subreddit, but this is actually *preventing* a number of industries from adopting bitcoin."

I don't think taking the median of 2016 numbers is too complicated but you're right that an (exponential moving?) average is a simpler algorithm. I think the stability of a median is preferable but in the end both will probably work fine. In this case I was mostly interested, and I still don't have the answer, whether this change was a conscious decision or whether it's more arbitrary.
No businesses have use for commercial confidentiality?
"Thank you guys! Although I think 8btc should take most credit. 

Anyway, I'll keep my efforts translating / communicating to make the two largest bitcoin communities a bit more synced and close. "
"Great stuff, man! /u/changetip $10

The translation looks superb. Might I suggest 在链 as a possible candidate for translating ""on-chain,"" in the same way 在线 is used for ""on-line""? e.g., 在链交易 for ""on-chain transactions."" Just an idea! For me part of the fun of translating is occasionally having to invent new words. =)

Edit: I see /u/kcbitcoin went with 链上. I guess that works, too!"
/u/ChangeTip $20
Are you saying commercial confidentiality is the opposite of on-chain scaling?
Not sure to understand your point. Are you suggesting that Core devs listen only to businesses exploiting confidentiality? Are you also suggesting that big block proponants and Classic don't care about privacy?
"What they most likely think is that a hard fork to 2 MB would open doors for further blocksize increases and hard forks. Thus they think it's risky and want to nip it in its bud.

Also maybe more importantly it makes Core lose its control over the protocol development, which would make their long term plans for new features harder to implement.

Of course I'm just speculating here. It would be interesting if one of the Core devs could shed some light on the real motivation for opposing 2 MB."
Nicely said. I think that's a valuable perspective.
Right on!
"Fly peacock fly!

There was no roadmap until now. This is firs proposal. Up until now there was only short term goal of increasing the block limit.

"What do you mean ""exploiting confidentiality""? I'm just talking about the need for privacy by all participants. Ideally there is no need for anyone except you and the person you transact with to know the details of who paid whom how much, or even that a transaction occurred at all. That's an ideal, and there's a whole spectrum of solutions with various tradeoffs trying to achieve that idealistic goal. In the space of possible options, on-chain transactions doesn't rate very well."
"On-chain scaling puts every transaction on the block chain, with at best pseudo-anonymity and little value privacy, both of which can be compromised by people downstream of you. So yes, ""immutable public record"" and ""commercial confidentiality"" _are_ at odds with each other."

This.
**QUESTION:** Will we, the users, be able to watch that conference live on YouTube or something?
"wow. I absolutely **love** this roadmap.

It get's me excited, to-da-moon-style.

I have some questions:

 * regarding Weak blocks: miners constantly preannouncing the blocks they mine would greatly reduce 0-conf risk and ensure those business models can continue existing? I'm hoping RBF wont make it into Classic.

 * I would love to see Peter Wuilles optimized secp256k1. Will it be included in the 0.12 version?

What can an incentive be for a non-mining full node? It's all voluntary unless used for verifying your own/your business transactions. That's why I don't see a point of running a node used only for relaying transactions and storing a blockchain. Clients better to connect directly to miners, and miners need to put out more well connected nodes, like BTCC is doing.
Thanks, made the changes! Feel free to edit and submit a pull request if you see anything else.
We just need to get this translated ASAP and posted on the Chinese forums.
It's should be stream live in contrast of Closed-Door-Dealing
">But i think it is lacking privacy enhancement, normal users(not miners or companies) have been requesting it for years but Core/Blockstream is completely inert in this subject.

To be honest Core has been working on Confidential Transactions (also adopted by Monero)."
"Glad to see that you're staying open minded.  Note that nothing in this roadmap prevents offchain scaling.  Rather the folks on this side of the debate believe that both are avenues that we should be pursuing in protocol development.

Please pass the news on to others who might not be reading this sub!"
I would like to see some incentives for running a full node in that road map even if it's in the longer term...  
"Why are we even discussion about this roadmap or classic's roadmap? It's not comparable. This is a professional roadmap that answers the needs of the community / economy, expresses a clear agenda, shows several approaches to solve the problems and delivers clear time-goals.

While the other roadmap is a confusing e-mail bei gmax about anything but scaling and without any clear time-goal (except SW ""asap"")

"
This is leadership in action!
"So happy that they chose Stephen Pair's ""Adaptative Block Size"" proposal for phase 3.

I have been arguing for a dynamic limit since BIP101 came out.... it is the most reasonable solution.

Overall this roadmap looks excellent. A **global peer to peer cash system** is indeed what we all hoped Bitcoin would become. Nobody (except a tiny segment of people already working in payments) cares about a faster settlement layer only accessible to big companies and institutions. P2P is what we are here for!"
I will let my thermos decide for me
I don't think we get to be bulls again until Classic starts approaching a majority. Still, it's nice.
"Did you really page all miners? Please do ;-)"
I just read it as bullshit as fuck..... lol

Very happy to see the dynamic block size in there.  This feels right.
"Great news. A friend was over when I read this, I'm glad to finally feel like I can speak of promise in Bitcoin's future again, rather than vilifying internal politics.

Great Roadmap from the guys at Classic. Congratulations - I look forward to hearing how the Satoshi Roundtable goes!"
Someone should post this in North Korea
"Good idea to call it ""*On-chain* Scaling Conference"", because that is a crucial detail that was missing from Bitcoin Core's several ""Scaling Conference(s)"" and ""Roundtable meetings"". I look forward to the governance and on-chain scaling proper hard fork. And I'm sure that the economic majority is too.

This year will very likely be an exciting year in Bitcoin history as we evolve away from the tiny 1 MB limit. This is the road map that should have been written in the first place!"

"That's exactly how I feel. I actually prefer ""large block vs small block"" to ""on chain vs off chain"" because I think both on and off chain scaling are important. I guess I'd consider myself a moderate, and this roadmap reduces the risk of a slippery slope to unlimited block sizes."
"Yep, Let BlockSteam own the sidechain market, Bitcoin Classic bring back Satoshi's Vision to scale on-chain.

Both solution = Win-Win for Bitcoin Ecosystem"
"Yeahh... I guess I should rephrase that to: Someone other than *small* block supporters having a conference ;)

edit: oops."
I used to think us smaller miners wouldn't budge if the larger pools didn't and that may still be the case but perhaps we can show them the way...  I'm willing to turn my few miners towards Classic and just maybe if enough of us do that the larger pools will follow!  Both waiting for the other to take the first step...  Let's take the lead and see what happens 
Thanks!
"Well, it's lot easier to support Classic now.

These are much needed positive news."
"Certainly. And in fact, one could say that this is the first step towards developing it in public!

I was just curious how the process occurred up until now."
I've been a Core supporter so far, but this is a really good roadmap. Definitely food for thought!
Kcbitcoin, can you translate the whole roadmap ? I think its very important for the chinese miner to understand fully.
Plz chill with the anger, it's contagious and it turns off everyone's higher brain functions. I'm not invalidating why you are angry, I'm saying it is likely hurting you/us more than helping you/us.

Sounds great. Let me know when it's up and I will translate the comments / feedback.
Show me which *businesses* would not want on-chain scaling. Herm.. let aside Blockstream.
Agreed, that would be maybe even better.
